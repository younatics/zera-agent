"Ivan Rakitic is the subject of a three-way tussle between Barcelona, Real Madrid and city rivals Atletco. The Croatian star was instrumental in Sevilla’s Europa League triumph last season and La Liga’s giants want to snatch the 26-year-old playmaker. Rakitic’s father confirmed the interest from Spain’s three biggest sides but also said Sevilla were trying to keep their star midfielder. Wanted: Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic (centre) is a target for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico . ‘Right now his brother Dejan, who looks after his career, has offers from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid,’ Luka Rakitic told Croatian daily Jutarnji. ‘But in any case, nothing will be decided until after the World Cup. ‘However the conditions offered so far are no better than those submitted by Sevilla, where Ivan is a god.’ Rakitic has one year left on his contract at the Andalusian club. His release fee clause is €40million (£32.5m) but because of Rakitic’s contract situation the clubs are looking to purchase him for between £20-25m. Of the three challengers for his signature, Atletico Madrid are closest to making a deal. Party time: Ivan Rakitic celebrates with the Europa League trophy after  Sevilla beat Benfica . Barcelona’s new manager Luis Enrique is an admirer of Rakitic too and the Catalan club are striving to bring him to the Nou Camp. While Real Madrid would also like to secure his signature it is unclear where he would feature in the side and it is possible that their interest is designed to be a disruptive influence to hamper their rivals. The Champions League winners finished third in La Liga last season and will likely be active in the transfer market this summer to improve domestically. Rakitic is aware of his status at Sevilla and his popularity among supporters. His wife is from Andalucia and it will take a considerable offer to uproot him. Sevilla president Jose Castro will attempt to extract as much of the £32.5m clause as he can if Rakitic is sold.","Ivan Rakitic helped Sevilla win Europa League last season .

"Luis Enrique has laid down the law to his Barcelona players ahead of the new season. The strict coach has implemented a fines list which will see players punished for things from turning up late to training to arriving home after midnight.

"Greaves has put the medal up for auction next week at Sotheby’s . He was the forgotten hero of 1966. One of England’s greatest players, Jimmy Greaves missed out on a World Cup winner’s medal because injury stopped him from being on the pitch in the final matches. A long campaign by fans led to him finally being honoured in 2009. But those who fought to see him recognised are likely to be less than impressed by the fact he is now cashing in. Greaves has put the medal up for auction next week at Sotheby’s. The former footballer, now a 74-year-old great-grandfather, is expecting to bank up to £50,000 for the 18 carat gold award. Greaves had previously said it was ‘terrific’ to have finally received the medal, adding: ‘It was devastating for me that I didn’t play in the final. I always believed that we would win the World Cup and I’d be part of it, but I wasn’t.’ In May, the player-turned-TV pundit, who has battled alcoholism, sold the country house he shared with wife Irene. Yesterday it also emerged that Mrs Greaves, 74, has a county court judgment against her for an outstanding £185. The judgment, from August, gives her address as the £100,000 home where the pair’s daughter Lynn lives in Sudbury, Suffolk, suggesting they have now moved in with the 56-year-old. The couple have four children – Lynn, Mitzi, Andy and Danny. Greaves  with his medal and then Prime Minister Gordon Brown after fans campaigned for him to be honoured . Greaves' medal is expected to go for between £30,000 and £50,000 went it goes under the hammer next week . Greaves scored 44 goals in a 57-match England career and was the most prolific striker of his generation, playing a crucial role in the earlier stages of the 1966 World Cup. But he was injured in the third game and replaced by Geoff Hurst, who kept his place for the final even though Greaves had recovered. Hurst – now Sir Geoff – famously went on to score a hat-trick in the 4-2 victory against West Germany at Wembley. Until the 1978 tournament, only those who played in the final game won a medal. Greaves was badly affected by the snub – and by the death of his four-month-old son, Jimmy Jnr, in 1961 from pneumonia – and later became an alcoholic. However, he eventually stopped drinking and reinvented himself as a sports pundit, newspaper columnist and after-dinner speaker. Greaves won 57 caps for England and then worked on TV and as an after dinner speaker following retirement . Jimmy Greaves (front right) stands with chairman of the FA Geoff Thompson (front left) in front of the other recipients of medals presented by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after a Downing Street reception for unused members of the 1966 World Cup squad in 2009 . Greaves was considered one of the best goalscorers of his generation and scored 44 goals for England . Astonished at the injustice Greaves and other England squad players faced, fans campaigned for the ‘forgotten heroes’ of 1966 to be given medals retrospectively. The campaign eventually paid off, and in June 2009, Greaves and the others were presented with medals at Downing Street by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who said: ‘Justice has finally been done.’ Greaves smiled broadly as posed with his medal, saying: ‘What do I think? Yes, terrific, unexpected. Obviously, it is something FIFA or the good old FA feel has been, while not a wrong, something that needs to be put right. We are all part of the history of the World Cup.’ The 1966 squad pose for the team picture ahead of the tournament - Greaves sits on the front row, second left . The World Cup winning team of 1966 received a combined bonus from the FA of just £22,000 . Greaves teamed up with Ian St John on TV for the Saint and Greavsie show between 1985 and 1992 . Friends said Greaves had not pushed to be given the award and has spent much of his life trying to play down the significance of missing out on the final. They said he ‘doesn’t give a monkey’s’ about memorabilia and medals and, having retired from punditry, ‘could probably do with the money’. Greaves played at a time when financial rewards for footballers were nothing like they are today. The World Cup winning team received a combined bonus from the FA of just £22,000. Yesterday, Greaves declined to comment on why he was selling his medal. Former neighbours in Suffolk said he had sold his detached country house in May after living there for just two years. Records show the house was bought in 2012 for £499,995 and then sold again this May for £499,950. The medal – which comes in the original wooden case and with ‘a signed letter of authenticity from Jimmy Greaves’ – is being auctioned as part of a sale of sporting memorabilia at Sotheby’s in London on Monday and Tuesday.","Jimmy Greaves initially missed out on a World Cup winner's medal .

"County police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of protesters as the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teen was shot by a city police officer overwhelmingly avoided violence on Thursday after nearly a week of unrest and mounting public tension. The dramatic shift came after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. 'All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,' said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. 'This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.' Scroll down for video . Captain Ronald Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol hugs Angela Whitman in Ferguson on Thursday. The MHP took control of the St. Louis suburb, stripping local police of their authority after four days of clashes between officers in riot gear and furious crowds protesting the death of an unarmed black teen shot by an officer . The more tolerant response came as President Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting - and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force. Obama said there was 'no excuse' for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters. Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again on Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters had smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and where police had repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs. Captain Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol smiles as demonstrators march along West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson. The captain took a remarkably different approach to the protests following four nights of tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs . Johnson addresses the crowd of protesters, asking them to stay on the sidewalk and not block traffic on Thursday. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon placed Johnson, who grew up in Ferguson, in charge . But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party. The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell —the point at which previous protests have grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters. 'You can feel it. You can see it,' protester Cleo Willis said of the change. 'Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.' Nixon appointed Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is black, to lead the police effort. Johnson, who grew up near Ferguson and commands a region that includes St. Louis County, marched alongside protesters Thursday, joined by other high-ranking brass from the Highway Patrol as well as the county department. The marchers also had a police escort. 'We're here to serve and protect,' Johnson said. 'We're not here to instill fear.' Several people stopped to shake hands and even hug Johnson and other officers, thanking them by name. At one point, Johnson spoke to several young men wearing red bandanas around their necks and faces. After the discussion, one of the men reached out and embraced him. At the QuikTrip, children drew on the ground with chalk and people left messages about Brown. Obama had appealed for 'peace and calm' on the streets. 'I know emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,' Obama said. 'But let's remember that we're all part of one American family.' Residents in Ferguson have complained about the police response that began soon after Brown's shooting with the use of dogs for crowd control — a tactic that for some evoked civil-rights protests from a half-century ago. The county police had taken over the investigation of Brown's shooting and security at the request of the smaller city. Nixon vowed that 'Ferguson will not be defined as a community that was torn apart by violence but will be known as a community that pulled together to overcome it.' The governor was joined at a news conference by the white mayor of St. Louis and the region's four state representatives and the county executive, all of whom are black. Many people drove down the street honking their horns, raising their arms, and holding signs in Ferguson where protests took on a more peaceful vibe . The protests took on a different tone in the streets of Ferguson on Thursday. Several people stopped to shake hands and even hug Captain Johnson and other officers, thanking them by name . People have taken to the streets since Saturday when unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a local police officer . The city and county remain under criticism, though, for refusing to release the name of the officer who shot Brown, citing threats against that officer and others. The hacker group Anonymous on Thursday released a name purported to be that of the officer, but the Ferguson police chief said the name was incorrect. Like the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, social media brought international attention to the tragedy. Ferguson spawned a proliferation of hashtags and has been a dominant subject on Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Journalists and protesters offered real-time pictures, videos and updates, and the world responded. Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown, has told a much different story. He has said the officer ordered them out of the street, then grabbed his friend's neck and tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Attorney General Eric Holder has said federal investigators have interviewed witnesses to the shooting. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said federal authorities have interviewed Johnson. Holder spoke by telephone Thursday with Brown's family. In St. Louis, Brown's mother appeared briefly Thursday night at an anti-brutality gathering near the city's Gateway Arch, urging through a relative for peace to prevail. The observance was among many staged nationwide, each with a minute of silence for Brown and others affected by alleged police brutality. A demonstrator holds a sign on Thursday in Ferguson, Mo.

"Connecticut could become the first state to curb loud movies under proposed legislation that's drawing opposition from the Motion Picture Association of America. The legislature's Public Safety and Security Committee is considering the bill, which would prevent theaters from showing a film or preview that exceeded 85 decibels. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends noise should be kept below 85 decibels for workers for eight hours to minimize hearing loss. 'Hopefully this will be a wakeup call to the theater owners and the MPAA to get their act together and do something that's good for the public and still will satisfy their needs,' said William Young, a Stamford resident and chemical industry consultant who has pushed the measure. 'Why they need such loud sounds is beyond me.' Movie theaters in Connecticut may have to keep the noise level below 85 decibels to ensure worker safety . Jon Griffin, a policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said he believes Connecticut would be the first state to regulate the maximum decibel level at movies. Vans Stevenson, a senior vice president with the MPAA, also said the issue is not regulated. A New York lawmaker has unsuccessfully pushed a measure that called for preventing trailers and commercials from playing louder than feature films. Dr. Robert Dobie, a professor at the University of Texas who is an expert in noise-induced hearing loss, said the 85-decibel standard is for workers' prolonged exposure, not occasional loud sounds from a movie. 'The exposure is so brief and intermittent that no one with any expertise would ever say that they have any real risk of hazard or harm,' Dobie said. 'I feel quite comfortable that the exposures are not anywhere near hazardous. It's the combination of level and duration that matters.' For comparison, the American Tinnitus Association says 85 decibels is the sound of average traffic, 80 decibels is the sound of an alarm clock 2 feet away and 100 decibels is the sound of a blow dryer. Sen. Carlo Leone, D-Stamford, said he was part of a delegation that introduced the bill at Young's request. That way, a public hearing will help lawmakers determine how to proceed, he said. 'I support the concept moving forward,' Leone said. 'If there are other corrective measures without legislation and it takes care of the problem, that would be the better choice.' Sen. Carlo Leone, D-Stamford was part of the delegation that introduced the bill . Stevenson told the committee at a hearing this past week that the legislation is unnecessary and undermines voluntary standards adopted by companies and theaters that set appropriate sound levels. A standard was developed at the request of theater owners to address audience complaints about excessively loud trailers and significant steps have been taken to voluntarily reduce volume levels, the association said. 'Certainly no one is going to do anything that would have a hint of being harmful,' Stevenson said. 'We've gone to great lengths to make sure that average is in an acceptable range that is not harmful.' Young says the standard doesn't work because it measures the average decibel of an entire preview, so it can have extremely loud portions. Young, who has been working on the issue with his colleague, Arnold Gordon of Greenwich, says their tests of previews found sustained bursts as high as 110 decibels. Young, who has a doctorate in chemistry, favors setting a peak limit. He says the sound is so loud it leaves his ears ringing. 'Who wants to sit there in pain?'  Young said. ""These companies shouldn't subject people to harmful sounds."" MPAA says the bill would violate the First Amendment right to free speech by regulating how a movie and trailer is presented and is discriminatory because it applies only to movie theaters and not to other venues such as rock concerts or sporting events. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends noise should be kept below 85 decibels for workers for eight hours to minimize hearing loss .","Noise should be kept below 85 decibels for workers for eight hours to minimize hearing loss .

"A controversial Fourth of July parade float has drawn a firestorm of criticism in Nebraska. Featured . in Norfolk's annual Independence Day parade, the float depicts a . figured dressed in overalls standing next to an outhouse labeled the . 'Obama Presidential Library.' The figure, which was decorated in a greenish, zombie-like color, has its hand pressed to the sides of its head.

Omaha reports that no sponsor was identified on the pick-up or the float. A picture of the float, taken by Pierce, Nebraska's Liz Guthrie, went viral on social media. Guthrie told reporters she could hear people applauding and laughing at the display as it passed. However . Norfolk resident Glory Kathurima, a black woman who attended the parade . with her 9-yeard-old daughter, said she thought it was an extremely . offensive depiction. She later complained to the mayor along with the local chamber of commerce and the Norfolk Daily News to express her concerns. She believed the entry went out of it's way to call the president stupid. The float's supporters claim it was meant as a political cartoon and did not have racist meaning . The Nebraska Democratic Party later issued a statement calling the entry among the 'worst shows of . racism and disrespect for the office of the presidency that Nebraska has . ever seen.' 'The  City of Norfolk doesn’t condone that,' Norfolk City Councilman Dick Pfeil told reporters. However he added float approval was in the hands of the Odd Fellows.

"Britain and the US are set to launch missile strikes against the Syrian regime in retaliation for its barbaric chemical attack on civilians. David Cameron and Barack Obama discussed the plan in a 40-minute phone call at the weekend and will finalise the details within 48 hours. The two leaders want to send a clear warning to dictator Bashar Al-Assad over the deaths of as many as 1,300 people, many of them children. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has insisted any military action in Syria would be to prevent the future use of chemical weapons . Meanwhile, U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said its armed forces were in place in the region and was 'ready to go' should President Barack Obama order action . William Hague said ‘all the evidence’ suggested Assad’s henchmen carried out last week’s horrific nerve gas atrocity. ‘We cannot, in the 21st century, allow the idea that chemical weapons can be used with impunity – that people can be killed in this way and that there are no consequences for it,’ insisted the Foreign Secretary. ‘We believe it is very important there is a very strong response so that dictators, whether Assad or others who might slaughter their own people, know that using chemical weapons is to cross a line, and that the world will respond.’ Royal Navy commanders in the region are preparing to take part in the assault, which is likely to be unleashed within ten days. Government sources indicated the cruise missile blitz is likely to be short and sharp and will not signal an intention to get involved in the bloody civil war in Syria. But it will inevitably lead to fears that Britain could get sucked into another Iraq-style nightmare. Military planners in Washington and London are addressing the ‘significant challenge’ of finalising a list of potential targets designed to cripple Assad’s chemical warfare capability. The intervention is likely to involve missile strikes rather than an airborne bombing campaign, in order to avoid the dangers posed by the sophisticated air defences supplied to Syria by Russia. A British source said ‘naval assets in the region’ were likely to be involved, suggesting the possible use of submarine-borne Tomahawk cruise missiles. In an ominous development Damascus last night warned US president Obama that any intervention would not be a ‘walk in the park’, adding: ‘It will bring chaos and the region will burn.’ Iran warned the West it would face ‘severe consequences’ if it intervened in Syria. And Russia, which has blocked UN action against Syria, said unilateral action by the West would undermine efforts for peace and have a ‘devastating impact’ on the security situation in the Middle East. The Syrian regime last night attempted to head off a military intervention by the West by announcing it would finally allow United Nations experts to visit the gas atrocity site in Damascus. Inspectors are expected to begin their work today. Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.' 'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria . But Washington and London dismissed . the move, saying it was ‘too late to be credible’, and followed almost a . week of shelling of the area during which much of the evidence may have . been destroyed. Britain, . the United States and France have all blamed the Assad regime for the . attack because the rebel fighters are not thought to have the capability . to carry out an atrocity on that scale. President . Francois Hollande, who spoke to Mr Cameron yesterday, is also pushing . for swift military retaliation and could authorise the use of French . forces in the attack. In a . statement following the talks, Downing Street said the two men ‘agreed . that a chemical weapons attack against the Syrian people on the scale . that was emerging demanded a firm response from the international . community. This crime must not be swept under the carpet.’ Mr Hollande’s office said: ‘France is determined that this act does not go unpunished.’ A Government source said the Prime Minister had not abandoned hope of achieving tougher UN action against Syria in the future. But with Russia frustrating progress, the source said Mr Cameron believed any short-term military response would have to be taken outside the UN process. ‘This looks like one of the worst chemical weapons attacks of modern times,’ another Government source said. ‘If you are responding to an attack on this scale you have to do it quickly. If you let it go for two, three, four weeks there is a danger you send a message that it doesn’t matter.’ Just one section of the huge Quru Gusik refugee camp in Iraq which is now home to thousands of displaced Syrians .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has discussed the crisis several times with Mr Cameron in recent days and a senior Lib Dem source said there would be an agreed Coalition response. ‘The Government is working as one on this,’ the source said. A government source said it was ‘possible’ that Parliament could be recalled early from its summer recess this week to discuss the crisis. But the source stressed that Mr Cameron had always reserved the ‘flexibility’ to order a military strike in response to fast-moving events without recourse to Parliament. Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown yesterday warned against rushing to military action on Syria. But Lord Ashdown, who remains close to Mr Clegg, acknowledged that the UN would be ‘greatly diminished’ if the world failed to respond to Assad’s ‘terrible breach’ of international law. Bob Corker, the ranking Republican on the US Senate foreign affairs committee, said he had spoken to the Obama administration about its plans for Syria and believed the president would seek authorisation from Congress. ‘I think we will respond in a surgical way and I hope the president as soon as we get back to Washington will ask for authorisation from Congress to do something in a very surgical and proportional way,’ he told Fox News. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘No decisions have been taken on military action and the timetable for a serious response from the international community is not yet clear. ‘We are very conscious of when MPs are due to return and haven’t ruled out recalling them earlier.’ Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said it is right that the UK works with the international community to find a solution on Syria . David Cameron was under pressure to recall Parliament last night to debate the Syrian crisis before Britain launches any missile strikes. Labour politicians, backed by Tory counterparts, said it was essential that MPs had their say on such a potentially momentous move. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘In light of ongoing international developments, it is right that the UK works with the international community to try to find an agreed way forward in Syria. If, in reality, the Prime Minister is now considering military options involving UK personnel then of course I would expect him to seek a recall of Parliament and to come to the House of Commons and make his case in advance of a decision being made.’ Bob Stewart, a Tory MP and former military commander, said: ‘Parliament may well have to be recalled before we take any military action, because then that gives us justification. ‘We’re not going to get a Security Council resolution because the Russians aren’t up for it, and the Chinese certainly aren’t.’ He said that if it was confirmed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attacks then Britain would have to act. ‘We shouldn’t just talk,’ he added. ‘We would have to actually act, and by acting we probably mean some kind of punitive warning action using missiles. That means military action – that means a recall of Parliament.’ Fellow Tory MP Sarah Wollaston indicated she would oppose any military intervention in Syria that did not have the full backing of the United Nations. Dr Wollaston, one of many in her party who is sceptical about the benefits of any intervention, said: ‘Parliament must be recalled before, not after, any decision on military involvement or action in Syria. ‘I don’t believe unilateral Western intervention in Syria can achieve anything other than escalation into a global conflict.’ MPs are away from Westminster for another week on Parliament’s long summer recess. David Cameron indicated before the recess that he would recall Parliament before taking any step toward war, such as arming the Syrian rebels. A Downing Street source said it was possible Parliament would be recalled this week to discuss the crisis. But the source said the Prime Minister had always stressed that the Government needed the ‘flexibility’ to respond to major events without recourse to Parliament. Speaking in the Commons before the summer, Mr Cameron said: ‘We make a big commitment to come to this House and explain, vote and all the rest of it but governments have to reserve the ability to take action swiftly on this or other issues.’ Technically the Prime Minister has the power to authorise military action without the approval of Parliament. But in practice, all major military interventions in recent times, including the wars in Iraq and Libya have gone ahead only after a Commons vote. However, government sources last night suggested the missile attacks being planned against Syria were simply a response to last week’s chemical weapons atrocity. A source said any strikes should not be seen as a sign that further action, such as bombing raids, no-fly zones or arming Syria’s rebels, will follow. The Prime Minister has the power to declare war as a result of the wide-ranging royal prerogative – powers held by the Queen and exercised by the government of the day. In 2006, Mr Cameron questioned whether a prime minister should continue to be able to use the royal prerogative to declare war or sign international treaties without first consulting MPs.","David Cameron and Barack Obama discussed plan in 40-minute phone call .

"In 2006 everybody hailed Barcelona. They had finally relented, after more than a century of wearing that unblemished, iconic, red-and-blue striped shirt, and taken on a sponsor. Except that instead of a beer brand or appliances company it was Unicef. And they paid the charity for it too, with over £1million annually going towards its projects. On the pitch, Barcelona dived, fouled and cheated as much as any other team, but in between the gaps they played fabulous, expansive football. Purists adored them, millions dreamed of the opportunity to watch the likes of Ronaldinho, Xavi, Deco and the rest at the Nou Camp. They were everybody’s 'second team'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Barcelona fans discuss the potential signing of Luis Suarez . Soul: Is Barcelona still 'more than a club' after its latest transfer pursuits and sponsorships? Beautiful: Barcelona's tiki-taka style has gained many admirers around the world . Mes que un club - more than a club - was the slogan they used to describe themselves. It refers to their commitment to matters beyond the football pitch, social and political affairs both local and global. The slogan was initially invented by president Narcis de Careras in 1968, concerning their backing of Catalan society, which had been attacked by Spanish dictator Franco. Franco’s dictatorship tried to end the club’s social significance, removing the Catalan stripes from the crest. Time passed, Franco died, Spain became democratic again and Barcelona wanted to apply their slogan to more than just Catalonia. ‘Barca has extended its social commitment to the rest of the planet,’ announces the club website, proudly. It heralded the Unicef deal as a specifically significant marker for this. But in recent years there have been numerous decisions made by the club which have flung it from their self-made throne and down, down into the mire, with all the other football clubs. The shirt is in danger of becoming more like a Formula One car than a football jersey. This week they have added Turkish appliances firm Beko to it, with its logo emblazoned on the sleeve. Deal: Barca's signed a deal with Qatar Airways to be their main shirt sponsor in 2013 . Generous: Previously Barca paid charity Unicef £1million a year to be able to emblazon their logo . VIDEO Xavi set to leave Barcelona to play in Qatar . In the middle of the shirt is the far more controversial Qatar Airways sponsorship. It is the successor to Qatar Foundation, which ended Barcelona’s stance of refusing commercial shirt sponsorship. The Unicef logo was been moved to another, less notable position on the shirt and from the start of the 2011-12 season Barcelona began to benefit from a £125m sponsorship deal. Late last year, Barcelona announced a new shirt sponsorship deal, with Intel advertising inside of the shirt. Intel’s marketing officer Deborah Conrad described it as 'more than sponsorship'. Perhaps a play on words on Barcelona’s club slogan, perhaps an unfortunate coincidence. But it highlighted how the attitude towards the previously pure, clean shirt had changed. And sponsorships are the tip of the iceberg. There have been some dubious practices going on at the club in recent times. The pursuit of Luis Suarez is the latest of them. This is a footballer who has been found guilty of racism by the FA. Who dives and cheats like the best of ‘em, who has recently bitten an opposition player for the THIRD time. Treble: Barca had no sponsor for more than 100 years but Turkish firm Beko have become their third . Core values: Up until 2006 Barcelona were steadfast in their determination not to have a sponsor on their shirt . And yet, despite biting Giorgio Chiellini and subsequently being issued a four-month global ban, Barcelona’s club president and sporting director both described him as ‘honourable’ and new signing Ivan Rakitic said that his apology made him ‘a noble man’. Bear in mind that this apology reads like it was spoken through gritted teeth, just days after claiming that he stumbled and fell into Chiellini. Bear in mind that Barcelona required Suarez to apologise before they could make a move for him. What Barcelona have been bearing in mind, above any qualms about Suarez compromising their club conscience, is that a front line comprised of Lionel Messi, Neymar and the Uruguayan would be nigh-on unstoppable. The Brazilian Suarez will be playing with, Neymar, came to the club under a storm cloud too. The repercussions of his transfer deal affected the club long into the season, with Barcelona paying £11.1m to the tax authorities that they had evaded during the deal. Pursuit: Barca are determined to sign Liverpool forward Luis Suarez this summer . Controversial: Barca's pursuit of  Suarez is in spite of the fact he has bitten three separate opponents . VIDEO Barca's praise for sorry Suarez . Barcelona denied any fiscal wrongdoing, stating that they were merely making a complimentary donation to the government to cover 'any potential interpretation made concerning the contract'. In reality, the signing of Neymar which, initially, appeared as if it were a £49m deal, could have cost more than £71m. Barcelona’s president at the time, Sandro Rosell, resigned, and the man who followed him, Josep Maria Bartomeu, described the whole thing as ‘embarrassing’. Then, there was the treatment of Eric Abidal. The Barcelona defender claimed that he was not paid while he was recovering from a liver transplant. He said: ‘What was hard to understand was what Barcelona said during my last press conference. By saying that it was a professional choice, it made other clubs doubt. It wasn’t even a question of money. The proof being that all the months I was ill, the club didn’t pay me.’ Pay: Frenchman Eric Abidal claims Barca did not give him his wages during his recovery from cancer . Fee: Barca failed to disclose the full payments made for Neymar during his transfer last summer . VIDEO Barca charged with €9m tax fraud over Neymar transfer . Barcelona refuted this, saying that they had paid for it mostly, with only a ‘very small’ part coming from medical insurers. The reason Barcelona want to buy Suarez, as well as Ivan Rakitic, Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre ter Stegen, is because the threat of a transfer ban still looms over them. They were given this ban for disobeying FIFA instructions over the transfers of minors, with 10 under-18 players they signed contravening legislation. On appeal, their ban has been suspended, so they are making all their necessary deals this summer in case it eventually gets upheld. All of this has left the club’s waters murky, like the sea by Barceloneta beach after the city’s famous all-night Sant Joan’s eve festival. If the good times of decades past at the Camp Nou were the party, we are currently in the madrugada - the twilight hour - knee-deep in filth, waiting for the clean-up operation to begin.","Barcelona did not have any sponsors on their shirts until 2006 .

"Japan executed two people Thursday, including a 65-year old female cult leader convicted of six murders that took place during supposed exorcisms. The Justice Ministry said 65-year-old Sachiko Eto and 39-year-old Yukinori Matsuda were executed by hanging. Matsuda was convicted of killing two people during a robbery in 2003. Eto turned to faith healing after she and her husband joined a cult, according to Japanese media reports. Scroll down for video . Justice Ministry said 65-year-old Sachiko Eto and 39-year-old Yukinori Matsuda were executed by hanging at Tokyo Detention Centre . She and two accomplices, including her daughter, were convicted of beating their victims to drive out 'demons' and then hiding their bodies at her home. During her trial, Eto's lawyers argued she had diminished responsibility as she was suffering mental problems at the time of the crimes. She pled not guilty, but a Japanese court upheld her sentence, ruling that her crimes were 'excessively grave'. Eto's daughter and another cult member were sentenced to life in prison for the 1995 murders. Japan is one of the few industrialized countries that have capital punishment. The lack of transparency in the system has been criticised by human rights groups, but capital punishment is generally supported by the public, according to opinion polls. An execution room at the Tokyo Detention House in Tokyo. Japan is one of the few industrialised democracies to maintain the death penalty . Japan had no executions in 2011 but has conducted seven this year. The Justice Ministry says 131 convicts are on Japan's death row. Amnesty International, which opposes the death penalty in all cases regardless of the nature of the crime, says the hangings have sparked fears of a new wave of executions. Roseann Rife, Amnesty International's East Asia Director, said: 'The executions of Matsuda and Eto are acts of premeditated, cold-blooded killing by the Japanese state.' Protests against the use of the death penalty are due to take place tonight outside the Ministry of Justice in Tokyo. The human rights campaign group, which argues state death penalties violate the right to life and is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, said it considers all individuals on death row in Japan to be at imminent risk of execution. Roseann Rife added: 'The latest executions make a mockery of the Democratic Party of Japan's pledge to hold a national debate on abolishing the death penalty. That debate needs to happen and the government should impose an immediate moratorium on executions.'

"The only copy of a historic Mary Pickford movie from 1911 has been discovered by a carpenter in an old New Hampshire barn. The silent film, called 'Their First Misunderstanding' marks a watershed period in cinematic history and also in the life of the pioneering actress. The moving picture is the first one that Pickford, who went on to be known as 'America's Sweetheart', wrote . and the first for which she was given credit in the advertising . materials. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Discovery: A frame from the restored reel, above, shows Pickford in full flow in the 1911 silent movie . Clout: By the time Pickford has ascended from child star to Hollywood legend she has changed the way that actors and actresses were paid, credited and offered contracts by the major film studios in the America . Before that, movie studios didn't want actors or actresses to become . household names because they would demand more money. Woodworker Peter Massie discovered the film along with six other vintage reels in a barn he was tearing down. The property where he found the . films used to be a summer camp for boys, and the movies were . probably shown to entertain the campers. Child star: Film bosses wanted to keep Hollywood star's from becoming household names, meaning Pickford for many of her early performances was simply credited as 'the girl with the curls' Famous faces: Pickford defied the convention that screen sirens should not divorce when she split from her first two husbands before marrying fellow screen star Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, above . Massie donated the films to a Keene State College where it was identified. After handing over the reels, he said: 'This is the coolest thing I've ever found on any job.' The Library of Congress is now funding the project to restore the film, it will be shown next month at Keene State. Canadian born Pickford was a co-founder of the United Artists film studio and helped establish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She retired from acting in 1933 and died in 1979. Global star: Pickford was a famous all over the world by the time she arrived in England, above, in 1946 to crowds of adoring fans . The 10-minute comedy-drama stars Pickford and her first husband, Owen Moore, as newlyweds having their first argument. Larry Benaquist, who led the prohect to restore the reels, discovered that the first minute of the film was destroyed, but the rest was in remarkably good condition. Until 'Their First Misunderstanding' Pickford had been known only as 'Little Mary', 'The Girl with the Curls' and 'The Biograph' girl, after her former studio. But that changed after this film after when demanded to be credited for her work. Benaquist, film program founder at Keene State College, said 'Now she was an actor with clout, and I think she used that to great advantage.' Mary Pickford: The Canadian actress who became America's sweetheart . Mary Pickford was born Gladys Marie Smith in Toronto, Ontario.She was known as “the girl with the curls” and “the Biograph girl” before audiences learned her name.Mary was forced to jump between a variety of studios, increasing her paychecks each time until she joined Douglas Fairbanks, D.W. Griffith and Charlie Chaplin to form United Artists.After breaking from the control of major studios with the formation on UA, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood.Already a legend of the silent film, Pickford won an Academy Award for her first 'talkie', the 1929 film Coquette.She went on to receive an honorary Oscar for her contribution to motion pictures in 1976.Mary Pickford died on May 29, 1979, in Santa Monica of complications from a brain hemorrhage.

"This is the shocking moment  police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesters who were carrying an apparently unconscious woman to safety during violent clashes in Ferguson on Monday night. The group was captured on video dragging the collapsed woman toward heavily-armored officers in the St Louis suburb, while screaming: 'She's having a heart attack, she's having a heart attack!' When they reached the line of police shields, they continued to beg, 'She needs help, she needs help just get her', to which one officer replied: 'Let her go, back up, we will get her.' But seconds later, police suddenly threw a tear gas canister into the crowd - causing protesters to cover their faces and flee - before firing rubber bullets and reportedly deploying stun grenades.

Concern: A group of protesters is seen carrying an apparently unconscious woman (pictured, in a pink hat) toward armored officers in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, while screaming: 'She's having a heart attack' Asking for help: When they reached the line of police shields, the demonstrators continued to shout: 'She's having a heart attack!' (pictured), before telling officers 'She needs help, she needs help just get her' Response: One officer, donning a gas mask and holding a gun, replied: 'Let her go, back up, we will get her' As plumes of smoke filled the air, the woman was apparently laid on the ground as a young man could be heard shouting: 'That's my momma!'.

"During a Boeing shareholder meeting on Monday,a conservative activist accused the aircraft company's CEO of buying then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 'commercial advocacy' in Russia by making a $900,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation. The money was earmarked for rebuilding schools in Haiti in the wake of a devastating 2010 earthquake. But the contribution came just months after Mrs. Clinton traveled to Moscow where she made what she called a 'shameless pitch' to ask a newly formed state-owned airline 'to buy Boeing aircraft.' It's not clear whether there was a quid-pro-quo promise of the donation in exchange for Mrs. Clinton's cheerleading. Clinton promised during the October 13, 2009 visit to Boeing Design Center Moscow that the U.S. Export-Import Bank 'would welcome an application for financing from Rosavia [the airline] to support its purchase of Boeing Aircraft, and I hope that on a future visit I'll see a lot of new Rosavia-Boeing planes when I land in Moscow.' Boeing ultimately won a $3.7 billion Russian contract. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spoken at corporate events for Boeing, often arguing in favor of Russian and Chinese purchases from the jet aircraft manufacturer -- which, it turns out, gave nearly $1 million to the Clinton Foundation . Clinton visited Boeing's Moscow design center in Oct. 2009, making her 'shameless pitch' for a state-owned airline to buy $3.7 billion worth of jets from the U.S. company . A month later, Clinton proudly announced that Boeing would donate $2 million toward the construction of the U.S. pavilion at the 2010 World's Fair in Beijing, China. The company had originally offered $1 million. Subsequently, the Clinton Foundation got its own Boeing windfall. The Washington Post reported Monday night that David Almasi with the right-leaning National Center for Public Policy Research challenged Boeing chairman and CEO W. James McNerney about the apparent 'conflict of interest,' and wondered aloud whether the company made itself vulnerable to prosecution for fraud. 'There is at least one lobbyist in jail right this minute for giving public employees travel and meals worth far, far less than $900,000,' Almasi said. 'He claims . he didn't intend bribery; that what he did was ""business as usual."" But . he's in jail now nonetheless. ... It seems reckless and unnecessary, . even if it was not illegal.' McNerney responded that he was 'confident' Mrs. Clinton 'would have advocated for Caterpillar's tractors or GE's turbines with equal fervor ... with or without these few donations,' and that he was 'highly confident that we followed the letter and the spirit of the law.' 'Commercial advocacy by people that lead our country is highly appreciated by those of us toiling in the vineyards,' he said. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A . political strategist in the state of Washington, where Boeing is . headquartered, had harsh words for both sides of the political . slap-fest. 'McNerney sounded defensive,' he said, 'but Almasi was obnoxious and it came off like one of those PETA stunts where they show up and ask Burger King to go vegetarian.' 'What . was he expecting? Probably half of the Fortune 100 either makes these . kinds of donations, or wishes they could figure out how to make it pay . off.' Ka-ching: Boeing cashed in with a $3.7 billion contract to build 737-800 series aircraft like this Turkish Airlines jet for the new Russian state-owned airline . David Almasi (L), with the National Center for Public Policy Research, upbraided Boeing chairman and CEO W. James McNerney (R) for exposing the company to conflict-of-interest accusations . 'That said,' the strategist, concluded, 'Boeing will get a black eye out of this, and so will Hillary Clinton. It seems like the longer she waits to decide whether or not to run, the more baggage there will be clustered around her feet.' The National Center, which lodged the in-meeting object, defended its actions. 'Mr. McNerney's response is inadequate and should concern shareholders,' the group's chairwoman Amy Ridenour said in a statement. 'He ducked the kernel of our question, which is why Boeing would make a donation to the Clinton Foundation at a time of such a conflict of interest. Even if the company's intentions were pure, such a move can raise legal questions.' She pointed out that the Boeing donation to Mrs. Clinton's family foundation came shortly after the Supreme Court decided the 'honest services fraud' case that kept former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling in prison – but reduced his sentence by 10 years. 'Honest services fraud was headlining the newspapers at the very time Boeing apparently was considering a major gift to a foundation run by the husband of the sitting secretary of state,' Ridenour said.","While secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton asked Russia's state-owned airline Rosavia to buy Boeing planes .

"A Florida stripper hung up the phone on a cop attempting to locate her missing daughter last night so she could get back on stage. Bobbey Jo Boucher, 29, was booked into the Pasco County jail for misdemeanor obstruction after she terminated a conversation with a police officer attempting to find her 10-year-old daughter who had been reported missing, signing off by saying: 'I have to get on stage.' Boucher had been the last person to see her daughter when she left her alone at a nearby BBQ earlier that day to head to work at Calendar Girls strip club in Hudson. Bobby Jo Boucher (pictured in mugshot) was charged with obstruction after hanging up on an officer looking for her missing daughter . The Smoking Gun reports that cops were initially summoned to Boucher's home when the young child's grandmother called to report her missing, saying it had been over four hours since she saw or heard from the youngster. They quickly started pulling together information about the child and her disappearance so they could enter her in the missing child database, but when they called her mother for details she hung up before cops could get some of the necessary details. Boucher claims she did not hang up, but was rather 'transferred to another caller who was calling her.' The child was found unharmed around 9 pm, and an hour later her mother was picked up at the club and arrested. She was released from custody this morning after posting a $663 bond.

"Hundreds of college-age revelers in Washington state — thwarted in efforts to continue a large party — threw projectiles at police who responded with pepper spray to disperse them, officials said. Multiple partiers were arrested during the fight late on Saturday and early on Sunday in Bellingham, according to police Sgt. Mike Scanlon. The Belligham Herald reported that police were breaking up a block party at an apartment complex near Jersey Street at 9:30pm. 'There was drinking, it became disorderly and pretty much an out and out riot,' Scanlon told The Associated Press. The riot lasted late into the night. Western Washington sophomore Sam Kaplan said a 'parade of people' made its way to the intersection, enlisting other nearby college partiers along the way. The instagram photographer (deliahatesyou) of this girl twerking on a police car wrote, 'They shot the homie in the head with a rubber bullet and tear gassed a collage party f#### da 5 O' The '5 O' battled up to 500 partiers who didn't want to stop raging . Scanlon said the unrest began as police dispersed a noisy party that had drawn a few hundred people. Many of the revelers then moved to nearby Laurel Park, where they were joined by even more people, Scanlon said, calling it a 'large, intoxicated, disorderly crowd.' The situation 'finally boiled over,' he said. 'They began hurling projectiles at police.' Up to 500 people had converged on the park as police worked to disperse them, at one point using pepper spray, Scanlon said. It took about 45 minutes to clear the area and restore order. Scanlon said that there were multiple arrests but he didn't have an exact figure. And he said he didn't know if there were any injuries.

"Tragedy: This released by the NYFD, shows Lt. Gordon Ambelas, who died at a hospital late Saturday night, July 5, 2014, after battling a blaze that broke out on an upper floor of a Brooklyn public-housing high-rise in New York . The Fire Department of New York is mourning the death of a lieutenant who became trapped while looking for victims in a public-housing high-rise blaze, the first to die in the line of duty in more than two years. Lt. Gordon Ambelas, 40, died Saturday after suffering multiple injuries while on the 19th floor of the 21-story building in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, officials said. 'We lost a real hero tonight and our hearts are heavy,' Mayor Bill de Blasio said of the 14-year veteran of the force. 'I ask every New Yorker to keep the lieutenant in their prayers.' Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters that Ambelas sustained multiple injuries after he went into an apartment on fire to look for victims. He was found unconscious inside of the apartment and was removed by fellow firefighters, de Blasio said. 'Ambelas went into the apartment to search for life and did not come out, and by the time his brother firefighters found him, it was too late for him,' Nigro said. It is the department's first line-of-duty death since Lt. Richard A. Nappi was killed fighting a Brooklyn warehouse blaze in April 2012. Ambelas is the 18th to die since 343 firefighters perished in the September, 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Apartment: Lt. Gordon Ambelas died at Woodhull Medical Center late Saturday night, July 5, after he was pulled from the building unconscious . Recovery: Emergency personnel from the New York City's fire and police departments work at the scene of a fire at public-housing high-rise building early Sunday, July 6, 2014, in the Brooklyn borough of New York . A police officer, Dennis Guerra, died in April after he and his partner were overcome by smoke and carbon monoxide while responding to a mattress fire on the 13th floor of a Coney Island public housing complex. 'When the firefighter came out, I saw many EMTs working on the firefighter,' witness Daniel Masri told CBS 2′s Matt Kozar. 'He was unconscious. They’re performing CPR.' The father of two was rushed to Woodhull hospital, where police guarded all the entrances and de Blasio and a priest rushed to his side. Ambelas, a 40-year-old married father of two daughters from Staten Island, was among the firefighters honored last month for helping to save a 7-year-old boy who became trapped in a roll-down gate in May. Wait: Members of the emergency services anxiously wait for Lt. Gordon Ambelas to be taken from the high-rise apartment block . The boy was pulled 15 feet off the ground when his arm and head got stuck. Ambelas said at the time that the incident 'shows that FDNY members are always ready to help others. It was great teamwork all around.' The fire broke out around 9:30 p.m. Saturday in an apartment on the 19th floor of the building that is part of the six-building Independence Towers complex owned by the New York City Housing Authority. It quickly went to a second-alarm as flames spread to the 17th and 18th floors. Two other firefighters were treated at Bellevue Hospital for minor injuries. Two residents received treatment at the scene for minor injuries.","Lt. Gordon Ambelas, 40, is the first FDNY firefighter to die in more than two years .

"Guy Wallace, who has been jailed for eight years after ordering his dogs to attack an Asian taxi driver before robbing him of his takings . A violent mugger who ordered his dogs to attack an Asian taxi driver by shouting 'kill him, kill him' after hurling racist abuse has been jailed for eight years. Guy Wallace, 20, used his Alsatian and Staffordshire bull terrier as 'weapons' to maul Sajid Hussain and was also overheard shouting: 'Go get him boy' before robbing the victim of his takings. Mr Hussain suffered multiple bites to his body during the attack and feared for his life as Wallace also shouted a torrent of racial abuse, which was heard by witnesses, and threatened to stab him with a machete. The victim was left covered in blood with 'shocking' injuries, including a brain bleed and a smashed nose and eye socket. He also had £120 snatched from a pocket and his mobile phone taken. Father-to-be Wallace, from Accrington, Lancashire, who has a record for violence, was caught after a witness to the horrifying attack on May 17 recognised him on Facebook as he posed for pictures with the two dogs. At Burnley Crown Court Wallace admitted robbery and being the owner of a dog which caused injury whilst dangerously out of control in a public place. The German Shepherd, which was thought to have been trained to respond to orders to kill, was ordered to be destroyed. Prosecutor Robert Elias told the hearing how Mr Hussain, who worked at Max Cabs in Accrington, finished his shift at 2.30am, parked his car outside his base and started to walk home. He walked past Wallace's flat and as he did so heard a voice shout: 'Kill him, kill him.' He looked up and saw Wallace with his Alsatian and was pointing towards Mr Hussain and goading the animal to become aggressive. A fierce-looking German Shepherd then ran at the victim, biting the top of his thigh and knocking him to the ground. Mr Elias said Wallace ran over and began to kick Mr Hussain to the head and body whilst he was on the ground. The court heard that Wallace, pictured, used his Alsation and Staffordshire bull terrier as 'weapons' to maul the victim Sajid Hussain . The victim was trying to protect himself as the dog was still biting him. The prosecutor said: 'He was in fear of his life and the risk on the ground of a dog biting you is obvious.' Wallace, 20, left, admitted robbery and being in charge of a dangerous dog in a public place . The prosecutor added that a second, younger dog, a Staffordshire bull terrier, then joined in and bit Mr Hussain near his left shin. The victim managed to get up and staggered back to the taxi office. CCTV showed him returning to the road where the base was. At the far end of the road, the dogs and the defendant could be seen attacking him and a man seemed to be pulling Wallace off the victim. Mr Elias continued: 'It's clear the complainant was pursued by two dogs. He alerted the men working in the office. They came to his rescue and called the police. The dogs pursued him when he tried to escape.' Wallace tried to grab Mr Hussain's mobile phone and took £120 from the victim's jacket pocket, ripping his clothes. The prosecutor continued: 'The defendant was seen by witnesses to be bouncing around as if under the influence of drunk or drugs. 'He was heard by Mr Hussain and other witnesses to shout foul racial abuse at him and the other men.' Mr Elias told the court Wallace had hold of the German Shepherd by the scruff of the neck, trying to goad it, saying, 'Get em, get em boy.' The dog was released again and the men retreated into the cab office to help Mr Hussain. The prosecutor said Mr Hussain's injuries were 'quite shocking' -his right eye was bruised and shut and he had bite marks to his legs. He was taken to hospital, where the acute surgical team examined him and gave him a tetanus injection and intra-venous antibiotics, . A CT scan showed he had a brain bleed and fractures to his nose and eye socket. He was admitted and later referred to a maxillofacial consultant. Wallace was later arrested but claimed the Alsatian escaped and he told Mr Hussain to calm down as he was panicking. He denied any racial comments and robbery. The prosecutor added: 'One of the witnesses recognised the defendant as he went to school with him and recognised him on Facebook.' Wallace had 24 offences on his record, including affray and wounding. Wallace was caught by police after a witness to the attack recognised him from pictures he posted of himself and the two dogs, pictured, on Facebook . Mr Elias said a police officer who went to see the German Shepherd considered it to be completely out of control and extremely frightening. The other dog 'could be salvaged' and the RSPCA could be given custody of it and try and retrain and rehome it if they chose to. Jonathan Dickinson, defending Wallace, whose girlfriend is due to give birth in December, said his client had 'a lot of alcohol which almost certainly disinhibited him.' Mr Dickinson added: 'This is certainly not a carefully conceived plan to rob the unfortunate victim. He committed an offence which was horrific, but unplanned and reckless. 'Once sober the following day, he couldn't understand why he had acted in the way he did. 'He realises alcohol has a very negative impact on his behaviour and he's trying to get himself help. 'He says he has severed contact with his criminal associates. He appears to be committed and motivated to change his ways.' But passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Peter Atherton said: 'It as a terrifying incident for Mr Hussain. It has been severely disturbing for him. 'Your dog was clearly your main weapon of attack. The robbery was incidental to the gratuitous violence which preceded it.'","Guy Wallace, aged 20, used his two dogs to attack taxi driver Sajid Hussain .

"A high school graduate tired of having his car seats soaked after a day at the beach has created swimming shorts that stay dry - even while in the water. Frank Shaw, from Toronto, Canada, is funding his Frank Anthony swimwear line through Kickstarter, and after 15 days he has already surpassed his $10,000 goal to raise $45,000. 'We wanted to create a garment that could . transition from a day at the beach, to a workout at the gym and a night . on the town all without having to change,' the 19-year-old told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . A high school graduate tired of having his car seats soaked after a day at the beach has created swimming shorts that stay dry - even while in the water . The swimming trunks, which range in price from $43 to $62, are made in Italy using Hydrophobic Nanotechnology fabric - a polyester blend that prevents all water-based substances from absorption -  which is manufactured and produced in Switzerland. 'When the garment is underwater the . fabric creates an air surface around the shorts preventing water from . seeping through the nanoscale whiskers,' explained Mr Shaw, who wouldn't disclose which Swiss company produces the fabric, but claims that the swim trunks dry 95per cent faster . than any other swim shorts on the market. If his Kickstarter campaign reaches $55,000, Mr Shaw will also release a women's line of swimwear made from the same material. 'We want to create a . unique garment which will allow women to feel comfortable in our shorts, . whether they choose to wear them while swimming or over-top of their wet . bikini,' he said. The swimming trunks are made in Italy using Hydrophobic Nanotechnology fabric - a polyester blend that prevents all water-based substances from absorption - which is manufactured and produced in Switzerland . 'When the garment is underwater the fabric creates an air surface around the shorts preventing water from seeping through the nanoscale whiskers,' explained CEO Frank Shaw . Mr Shaw first got the idea, which took . just nine months to conceive, after finally losing patience with having . to dry his swim shorts after use. But the first prototype, he said, was a flop. 'We spent all this money to get the top of the line Nanotechnology coating imported from Colorado to Toronto - the spray was used for Industrial applications, and is terribly unsafe,' he admitted. 'We thought we were going to create these awesome shorts that never would get wet because of the coating! Boy were we wrong, the shorts wouldn't even go over my waist due to how stiff the coating made them. 'The shorts went from a navy blue to a white because of the coating and the smell was cancerous.' Mr Shaw scraped the idea of Nanotechnology coating and instead decided to investigate Nanotechnology fabric. 'We wanted to create a garment that could . transition from a day at the beach, to a workout at the gym and a night . on the town all without having to change,' 19-year-old Mr Shaw told MailOnline . Mr Shaw, from Toronto, Canada, is funding his Frank Anthony swimwear line through Kickstarter, and after 15 days he has already surpassed his $10,000 goal to raise $45,000 . 'Our current provider created a unique blend which has been tested and perfected for swimwear,' said Mr Shaw. While there have been plenty of water-repelling swim shorts created before him, by American-made retailers such as Outlier and Flint and Tinder (which both use Nanosphere treatment on its fabrics), Mr Shaw says his inbuilt Hydrophobic Nanotechnology makes Frank Anthony shorts 'revolutionary'. 'Water repelling technology has been out for quite some time now and offers surface spill protection, but the technology completely loses all forms of productivity when over encumbered with liquid due to it's surface coating characteristics,' said Mr Shaw. 'We also noticed that a lot of surface coatings which provide water repelling characteristics often fade over time. Due to the characteristics of our fabric, the Hydrophobic Nanotechnology will last as long as the stitching on the garment.'","Frank Anthony swimwear is made from fabric using Hydrophobic Nanotechnology, which repels water ."
"It's the moment every pet owner dreads - when the time comes when they have to say a final goodbye to a faithful friend. These heart-breaking end-of-life snaps are meant to highlight the special relationship between an owner and their dying pet in its last moments. Sarah Ernhart, the owner of Sarah Beth Photography in Minneapolis,  created them in what she dubbed a 'Joy Session', in which she records owners' last embrace with their pets that are too old to live or have been diagnosed with terminal illnesses. Final embrace: These special, end-of-life photography sessions are just for terminally ill or elderly pets . Mrs Ernhart, who has been a professional photographer since 2006, trademarked the name Joy Session, and began offering them in 2010. She has since had more than 100 shoots with owners and their pets. 'People seem to love the idea,' she said. 'It's getting bigger and bigger.' The service has become so popular that Mrs Ernhart has built a directory of photographers around the world who shoot terminally ill pets with their owners. 'It can definitely be very emotional,' Mrs Ernhart said. 'It's a very sensitive time for these people who have been with these animals for their entire lives. I definitely have cried with some of the owners. 'The sessions can be happy at the same time because the owners get to talk about their favorite little quirks and things that they like about their pets. I get this inside view of what these people's lives are like. It's a pretty powerful.' Explaining how she came up with the idea, Mrs Ernhart said: 'The name ""Joy Session"" is not something I arbitrarily chose. There's a . very personal meaning behind it, and I'd like to share how it all began. Mrs Ernhart said: 'The name ""Joy Session"" is not something I arbitrarily chose.

'Shortly . before Christmas in 2009, I had a photo shoot with a woman named Joan. Her friend booked the session as a gift, and we had a beautiful sunny . day for it. 'Joan was living . at home in Hospice care, and relied on the companionship and day-to-day . help of her Service Dog, a Black Lab named Joy. Joy was her rock, her . best friend, and had saved Joan's life on more than one occasion. 'She would let Joan know when her blood sugar was low, and if she was about to have a seizure. Joy would place herself under Joan to break her fall, stand firm to help . her up, and was by her side day and night. I came into this session . knowing that Joan didn't have much time left, but I had no idea I'd be meeting such a vibrant, funny, happy woman. Mrs Ernhart, who has been a professional photographer since 2006, began offering her service in 2010 . The service has become widespread enough that Mrs Ernhart has built a directory of photographers around the world who shoot terminally ill pets with their owners . 'She . was so blessed to have Joy come into her life, and her eyes lit up with . every story she told of her. She said that Joy was her ""gift from God"" and taking these photos had given her something wonderful to look . forward to. 'Their bond was . palpable, and it was easy to see that both of them were very loved. Her . apartment was filled with the word ""Joy"" in artwork and pillows and . Christmas decorations. 'She even wore a ""Joy"" sweatshirt during our session.We sat and chatted for a long time. Joan's zest for life, even with her declining health, was a breath of . fresh air for me, and helped me see that what I do is meaningful and . important in so many ways. Emotional: The photographer said the sessions are for people who want to 'celebrate the happiness' their pets have brought to their lives . Final farewell: Two boys pictured saying their final goodbye to their pet dog . Last rites: An owner strokes his pet in the park before the terminally ill dog dies . 'Without . knowing it at the time, she and Joy sparked the idea to offer photo . sessions specifically for pets that are nearing the end of their lives. 'For so many people, their pets mean the world to them, and I want to . provide an opportunity to capture what makes them so special, especially . in such a difficult time. 'My . first ""official"" Joy session was with a Bernese Mountain dog named . Griffin, in January of 2010. I really didn't know what to call this . service, and ""Emergency Session"" was the first thing I could think of. It sounded so cold and impersonal, and I struggled with what I should . really call it. Difficult time: For many people, their pets mean the world to them, said Mrs Ernhart .

"A mother has told of her horror after finding a diet and exercise regime handwritten by her daughter who is just seven-years-old. Mother-of-three Amy Cheney found the to-do-style list outlining her young daughter's weight-loss plan 'innocently sitting on the floor' in her bedroom among her Polly Pockets and friendship bracelets. The fitness regime headed 'diyet' features a list of what her daughter plans to eat every day as well as how much exercise she must complete. There are boxes next to each step for her to tick when she has successfully completed a task. Shock: Mother-of-three Amy Cheney found this 'diyet' listing food and a daily exercise regime in her seven-year-old daughter's bedroom . Ms Cheney, a writer who lives in Australia with her family, told of her shock that a seven-year-old would even know what a diet is - let alone create one. Writing on the Australian lifestyle site Mama Mia, she said: 'I found this today in my daughter’s room. My daughter is seven. 'Diyet. Jesus. Where did she learn the word diet? How does she even know what a freaking diet is? 'Whose fault is this? Is it mine because . I let her play with Barbies? Because sometimes she’s allowed to watch . Total Drama Action? Is it because when I draw with her I can only draw . stick figures?' Anxious: Amy Cheney said she felt physically ill when she discovered her daughter's handwritten diet . The note says the schoolgirl can eat two 'yoget', three 'appals', one 'per' and two 'keewee froots' a day - amounting to around a measly 580 calories. According to the NHS, a 1991 report found that the average girl aged between seven and ten needs around 1,740 calories a day. This means Ms Cheney's daughter would have only been consuming one third of her recommended daily calorie allowance if she followed her strict diet regime. On top of this, the girls writes that she must complete a total of 34 'pooshups', 32 star jumps, three bike rides and runs up and down the driveway three times a day. After reading the demanding list, her horrified mother wrote: 'I felt sick. Physically ill. Like someone had knocked the air from my chest. 'I could feel myself getting increasingly anxious the more words I was able to interpret from her seven-year-old spelling.' Ms Cheney then questions how her daughter came to hear about diets and decide she needed to be on one. She continued: 'I am smart about this stuff. I have a degree in early childhood studies. Our family focuses on and promotes healthy eating and healthy bodies. Our attitudes are reasonable and balanced. Weight has never been an issue in our home – it is, for the most part, irrelevant.' Ms Cheney suggests that the media's obsession celebrity and how women look may have played a role. She said: 'I am tired of the beauty and . body obsessed arena we live in. I am tired of women being portrayed as . objects to be saluted and admired or shunned and shamed depending on . whether they measure up to societies idealistic standards. Amy Cheney's seven-year-old daughter's diet, listed below, amounted to just 580 calories - a third of the healthy recommended daily allowance for girls aged between seven and 10. Here is what she wrote: . 17 pooshups 2 times a day . 16 star jumps 2 time a day . 2 yoget (around 70 calories each) 3 appals (around 80 calories each) 1 per (around 100 calories) 2 keewee froots (around 50 calories each) 5 glases of water . Rid my bike 3 times a day . Rariry a meniy thing as you can find . Jog/run up and down the driv way 3 times . 'How dare you sneak into my home with your ridiculous standards and embed them in my little girls head, polluting her innocence with your pathetic ideals.' After speaking to her daughter about the to-do list, Ms Cheney reveals how she admitted a schoolfriend who was on a diet had told her about them. Ms Cheney said: 'So together we chatted about diets and beautiful healthy bodies and the gift that they are. 'I am not naive. I know this will not be the last time I talk about food and weight and bodies with my daughter. I am just ultra p***** that it had to start when she was seven.' But, according to recent research, Ms Cheney's daughter appears to be one of a growing number of girls who are becoming obsessed about their weight before they've even hit puberty. A study of 31,354 children by the Schools Health Education Unit last year revealed that half of the Year Eight girls questioned — those aged just 12 to 13 — already wanted to lose weight. The beginnings of this attitude can be seen long before that. An Ofsted survey in 2010 revealed that, for a third of ten-year-old girls and 22 per cent of ten-year-old boys, their main worry is how their bodies look. Girls who are not yet nine are putting themselves on diets: recent statistics reveal that nearly 200 British children aged from five to nine have been hospitalised for severe anorexia.","Mother Amy Cheney left stunned after discovering .

"Luis Suarez has started his pre-season training regime with a personal trainer in order to remain fit during his suspension. The Barcelona striker is not allowed to use club staff or even a coach associated with his country's football association, so has hired his own man to prepare him for action. Suarez, advised by his legal team to limit the amount of time he is seen publicly, is working with a detailed physical plan so he can fit into Luis Enrique's plans as soon as possible. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez locked out and posing for pictures with fans . D-Day: Suarez will have his last appeal heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne on August 8 .

Return date? Luis Suarez could make his  first Barcelona appearance against Real Madrid . With the Court of Arbitration for Sport set to hear the Uruguayan's appeal in mid-August, Suarez wants to be at his physical peak when he is allowed to re-join his team-mates. He is going to train in a discreet location and try to avoid being photographed, to prevent any misunderstandings with FIFA over his ban. The forward has been banned from 'all football activity' for four months, after he bit Italian Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Suarez has moved away from his in-laws house in Castelldefels somewhere nearby, where he is not being bothered by media and supporters who gathered where he was staying. The striker had to organise the trainer on his own and Barcelona are not allowed to tweak his training schedule. Not fooling anyone: Suarez holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of Giorgio Chiellini . Cover up! Suarez holds his face to suggest that he had only collided with the Italian defender . Barcelona hope that on appeal, even if the ban itself is not reduced in length, he will at least be permitted to train as normal at the club. His ban ends on October 25, the day before Barcelona are set to face rivals Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. While Suarez prepares by himself, Barcelona are set to fly to England to train at St George's Park. The squad, including the likes of Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Gerard Deulofeu, but not Lionel Messi or Neymar, will arrive at Birmingham airport around mid-day on July 28.

"Daniel Confino was thrown off the Eurostar after asking for an extra tea bag . He is the financial expert who saved the Eurotunnel project two decades ago when it looked sure to fail. But when Daniel Confino took the Eurostar earlier this month he was unceremoniously thrown off the train – because he asked for an extra tea bag. Mr Confino, 56, protested when staff tried to charge him £2.20 to strengthen two cups of tea he had ordered with an extra bag of Duchy Organic. After a brief argument, he left the drinks and refused to pay – only to be dragged from a carriage by two police officers and bundled off the train at a station in the middle of the Kent countryside. Mr Confino said the case summed up ‘the death of simple common sense and the triumph of bully-boy incompetence’. The father of four is now considering legal action, arguing that he suffered ‘degrading treatment, mental distress and anxiety’. ‘Any right-thinking person would have been outraged. To charge £2.20 for an extra tea bag was sheer spite,’ he said. ‘When I have a builder’s tea I like a proper stand-up job. The chef de train was French, or possibly Belgian. What do they understand about tea?’ In 1993 Mr Confino, from Brockley, South-East London, was working at the bank Hill Samuel when he was commissioned by the Department for Transport to advise on the Eurotunnel project. It had exceeded projected costs and looked doomed. But Mr Confino and his team secured a deal with the banks that kept it going. On Saturday a fortnight ago, Mr Confino took the Eurostar from Paris to St Pancras with a colleague after attending a conference. When he went to the buffet car to buy two teas he asked for two large cups, costing £2.20 each, but noticed they were the same as the smaller size, with just a little extra water. The medium-sized ones were 20p cheaper. Mr Confino protested when staff tried to charge him £2.20 to strengthen two cups of tea he had ordered with an extra bag of Duchy Organic . He asked for an extra tea bag that he could dip in each cup but was allegedly told by a member of staff that she ‘didn’t have authority’ to allow this. He asked to see a superior, but when she arrived she said he would have to pay another £2.20 for the extra bag. Mr Confino then demanded to speak to the chef de train, the senior staff member responsible for all passengers. But she too said he would have to pay £2.20 extra. ‘This was patently ridiculous,’ Mr Confino said. ‘My two large insipid “French style” teas – minus the extra tea bag – stood on the counter cooling and when I went to pay they put £6.60 in the card machine. They were being provocative.’ He refused to pay and walked off with the two cups and the extra bag, but staff threatened to call police and he returned the lot. He had not drunk any tea or removed the extra bag from its packet. Mr Confino was dragged from a Eurostar carriage by two police officers after refusing to pay for the tea; he said the case was an example of 'the death of simple common sense' He then tried to take just the two teas but when the staff again said they would call police, he mouthed that they were ‘idiotic bitches’ and left the cups with them. Later, he was in the toilet when there was a banging on the door. ‘I emerged to be confronted by two officers in high vis jackets, referring to me as “fella” and saying “you’re coming off the train”,’ he said. ‘They literally bundled me off. I had to resist strenuously, both verbally and physically, just to retrieve my bags. The train had made a special stop at Ebbsfleet and the whole theatrical performance meant everyone was looking. I was accused of stealing a tea bag. I was worried I would be spending the night in the cells.’ He said that when he explained his side of the story, the officers apologised and got him a free ticket to London. ‘They even offered to get me a cup of strong tea.’ Last night a spokesman for Eurostar apologised, saying: ‘We appreciate that Mr Confino made a simple request for a tea bag and it’s unfortunate that the situation escalated.’ The spokesman said, however, that staff had felt ‘threatened’ by the argument.","Daniel Confino was the financial expert who saved the Eurotunnel project .

"Two women were shot and killed and six other people were wounded in an early-morning attack at a house party in Nebraska's largest city, Omaha, police said. Officers responded to a report of gunfire at a home at the intersection of North 34th and Parker streets shortly before 2am on Saturday. The department said  two women were dead at the scene, including 19-year-old mother-of-one Ja'Kela Foster. Three people were taken by ambulance to Nebraska-Medicine-University of Nebraska Medical Center, where one is in a critical condition. Killed: 19-year-old mother-of-one Ja'Kela Foster (left) was shot dead at the house party on Saturday morning . Three others were driven to the hospital in someone's vehicle. Their conditions weren't released. Kristina Young, mother of slain Ja'Kela Foster, was waiting outside of the home hours later while investigators continued to gather evidence. She said she wasn't going to leave until the body of her daughter was taken away. Young said her boyfriend got a call from an aunt shortly before 2am telling him there was a shooting that may have involved Foster, who leaves behind a one-year-old son. She said a friend later called to say her daughter had been shot. Young said her daughter knew the person throwing the party and that she asked her not to go, knowing there would be drinking and worried there could be violence. Family: Foster leaves behind a one-year-old son (pictured), her mother Kristina Young (right) told reporters . Tragic: Foster (pictured with her son) was planning on going elsewhere on Friday but ended up at the party . 'I've been in Omaha long enough to know generally what happens at these parties.' She said her daughter agreed and told her she was going elsewhere Friday night, but that she apparently went to the party anyway. 'To the person who pulled the trigger, I want to say it's just senseless. It just needs to stop. I now have a one-year-old grandson that has no mother,' Young said while fighting back tears. She was comforted by her 29-year-old son, DeSean Young, who was Foster's brother. Danger: Foster's mother said she warned her daughter not to go to the house party earlier that day . Also wounded: Three people were taken by ambulance to Nebraska-Medicine-University of Nebraska Medical Center, where one is in a critical condition, and another three sustained severe wounds . Dorothy Wayne, who lives across the street from the home, said she and her husband were asleep when a shot passed through the wall of their front bedroom and lodged in the far wall. Neither was hurt. Although much of Omaha's violent crime happens in the area, Wayne said she was surprised by the shootings because it's always been a quiet street. 'There are mostly old people on our block,' she said.","Two women in their 20s were shot dead in shooting at 2am on Saturday .

The re-birth of a river Zin after years of drought has been captured on camera in the Negev desert in Israel  (pictured). For centuries the dry area, which is a massive creek bed, has seen the disappearance and return of water in a series of flash floods . The region of the Wadi Zim, in the Negev desert is flooded every few years (pictured by this stock image) and has been since Biblical times. The Negev desert is where 12 spies are said to have been sent by Moses to travel the Promised Land and the Zin river used to mark the border of Israel in Biblical times . The Negev (or Negeb) takes its name from the Hebrew neghev, meaning dry. Beersheba was a major crossroads for Abraham in the Old Testament. According to the Bible he arrived in the area 3,700 years ago dug a well to feed his flock and established a settlement for his people. The desert is the scene of many biblical events and was a place of exile and a wilderness. The Israelites wandered the Negev during the 'wilderness journey' after the Exodus. The Zin . river used to mark the border of Israel in Biblical times . The occasional flooding of the Negev is mentioned in the Old testament. For centuries the dry area, which is a massive creek bed, has seen the disappearance and return of water in a series of flash floods, Examiner.com reported. The landscape is dramatic in places with plunging canyons and meandering dusty paths, which cause small waterfalls and the water to ride over the bumpy, dusty terrain. The wave is impressive considering it is caused by rainfall miles away, and it does not take long for a convincing stream that gushes down holes in the rock to appear, strengthening all the time. The appearance of the river is highly . unpredictable and it has been years since enough rainfall has caused a . flash flood in the desert, experts said. The river Zin's source (pictured) is upon the slopes of the Ramon Crater - a geological feature located at the peak of Mount Negev, some 52miles (85 km) south of the city of Beersheba  - and it ends in the Dead Sea . However, locals have strange methods for predicting its return, as is shown by people waiting for the waves to show in the video. Meanwhile, companies that run jeep tours of the region to point out Biblical sights advise visitors to check the weather forecast in case a flood is imminent. The Negev desert is a dry and desolate land during the high summer months, but in the winter, rain falls on higher ground, such as the nearby ancient city of Beersheba. Rains that continue until around April can accumulate on high ground and lead to the flooding of the dry river bed below. The pattern of events is even described in the Old Testament of the Bible. It is thought the return of the flood waters (pictured) was because of heavy rain in mountainous regions several miles away from the arid land . Here, the powerful flow of flood water is shown cascading down a canyon. Local people have strange methods for predicting the river's return, and were waiting for the first waves to show. (Video grab pictured) The river’s source is upon the slopes of the Ramon Crater - a geological feature located at the peak of Mount Negev, some 52miles (85 km) south of the city of Beersheba  - and it ends in the Dead Sea.

"Two out of three Britons have more than £50 worth of unspent foreign currency just lying around from their holidays, reveals a new study. A survey of 2,000 holidaymakers by ICE (International Currency Exchange) says 49 per cent of us prefer to squirrel it away for our next trip away rather than have it converted back to pounds. Just under a third of people returning from their escape convert their cash when they get home while the same amount of tourists will spend up at the airport lounge and gifts shops. Hoarders: Two out of three Britons have more than £50 in unspent foreign currency for their holidays . Saving it for later: Almost half of UK residents keep the foreign currency for the next trip abroad . Nothing, save it for my next trip - 49% . Convert it when I arrive home - 32% . Spend it at the airport - 32% . Spend it on drinks or a meal - 18% . Buy gifts for family/friends - 16% . Use it to tip staff - 12% . Give it to charity - 2.7% . Source: ICE . For the kind-hearted souls, 16 per cent of those surveyed will use their excess money on gifts for loved ones before they get home while three per cent will give the currency to charity and 12 per cent will tip their hotel staff. 'If exchange rates were favourable when the currency was first ordered and another trip's on the cards, you can understand why you wouldn't rush to convert leftover holiday money back into Sterling,' says Koko Sarkari, chief operating officer for ICE, whose company offers a free quote for currency buy-back via text. 'But with almost half of us hoarding foreign cash, the hassle factor probably plays a big part in the decision not to convert it back.' With 66 per cent of those surveyed having at least £50 in foreign cash, that could mean there is almost £1.7billion in other money going to waste in British homes just from this years holidays (based on 53 per cent of UK residents taking an overseas break this year according to travel organisation Abta). KEEP AN EYE ON EXCHANGE RATES . Make a habit of having a look at the rates on your chosen currency each day, even multiple times a day, to get an idea of what is good value or a rip-off. Xe.com is simple and easy to use. http://www.xe.com/crm/input.php . DON'T TAKE THE EASY OPTION . It's so easy to just go to the window that says currency exchange and ask for some euros, but you could be doing yourself out of money. Just as rates fluctuate, so do the providers. The best bet is to call around or use a comparison website such as Travel Money Max. Most providers offer better deals online. Or ICE offers a text-back quote so you can arrange pick-up from your nearest provider. HAGGLING STARTS HERE . Bargaining isn't just for the souks, exchange rates can be negotiated too. Did you see a better rate at another supplier? The one right in front of you might match it. Or if you have a large sum of money to change for a big trip you could get a slightly better rate. It never hurts to ask. BEWARE FEES OR  'GREAT' DEALS . Using your card (credit, debit, visa etc) to get foreign currency is oh-so convenient, but could cost you the price of a drink at your destination. So ask if there are any fees that will be added. If a provider is spruiking the best deals or 0 per cent commission, it's likely too good to be true as they'll be making up for it some other way. CASH IS KING . All banks are a bit different, so it's worth checking fees. But to be safe, withdraw pounds from your bank's ATM and get cash converted. Watch currency rates trends before your trip . ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF MONEY . Travellers' cheques are a handy alternative to carrying stacks of cash. They can be replaced if lost or stolen, which is handy. The catch is that you can only change them to six currencies. American Express is the most widely accepted. Pre-paid cards can be helpful too, so you can put money you'll need on it before you go and use instead of the card with your life savings attached. But again, beware fees. KNOW WHAT MONEY YOU NEED . Currencies such as the Euros or US, Australian and Canadian dollars are straightforward, but the way some countries use money differs. Some may take local currency but prefer US dollars. Cuba has different money for locals and tourists. Morocco's Dirham can't be exchanged outside the country. Some research could really pay off.","66% of Britons have more than £50 in unspent foreign currency .

"A blushing bride was nearly left red-faced on her big day after the vicar tripped over the train of her strapless dress, almost pulling it down, and broke his arm. Reverend Roger Scoones was about to wave the newlywed couple down the aisle when he fell over the train of Katie Stoddard's dress and landed face down on the floor. The bride and groom immediately panicked and thought the 66-year-old vicar had suffered a heart attack at their wedding on Sunday at St Mary's Church, in Stockport, Cheshire. Scroll down for video . The moment the vicar tripped and fell - Rev Scoones is the circled blur to the right of bride Katie Stoddard. He fell heavily and broke his arm after attempting to jump over her gown . Reverend Roger Scoones broke his right arm but did not go to hospital until after the ceremony was finished . The congregation watched in shock as Rev. Scoones was helped to his feet by stunned groom Jon-Paul before carrying on with the ceremony, despite a broken right arm. Mr Stoddard, 31, said: 'The wedding was almost over, and we were just getting organised to walk down the aisle to the Wedding March as husband and wife. 'I think Roger must have thought he was about 20 years younger than he is because he tried to jump over the train of Katie's dress, but he tripped and fell. The wedding party, including Reverend Scoones prepare to walk down the aisle shortly before the incident . The panicked couple were horrified when the vicar fell and initially thought he had suffered a heart attack . 'He completely faceplanted and just lay there for about 30 seconds, everyone thought he had had a heart attack. 'I was wondering why no one else was laughing - I couldn't help myself. 'I pulled him to his feet - but by his arm which can't have helped - and he just carried on as if nothing had happened. He is a real trooper, he did a brilliant job.' Reverend Scoones tripped and fell over the train of Mrs Stoddard's full gown, breaking his arm in the process . Mrs Stoddard said 'It could have been worse' - her dress could have been pulled down at the same time . Mrs Stoddard's dress comes with a long and flowing train, which the vicar attempted to 'jump' over . Mrs Stoddard, an administrator, said: 'I was absolutely mortified - I don't deal well with these types of situations and was really worried. He fell and I heard this cracking sound. 'I couldn't believe what had happened, I looked down and he was just lying face down on my dress. But luckily he was okay. 'It could have been worse though - my dress was strapless and he could have fallen and pulled it down in front of all of our guests. 'Jon-Paul and his best man helped him up and he was a bit startled, and his stole was all skewiff. 'But he carried on and welcomed us as husband and wife.' Luckily the vicar was not seriously injured and the wedding party continued after the ceremony . Reverend Scoones was taken to hospital after the ceremony where his arm was placed in a plaster cast which will stay on for the next six weeks. The happy couple soon recovered from the shock of the vicar's fall and enjoyed the rest of their big day . The vicar, who has been officiating weddings for 33 years, said: 'It is a shame it wasn't caught on video otherwise I would have sent it in to You've Been Framed. 'The wedding party was just about to set off down the aisle, I raised my arm to signal to the organist and as I walked behind the bride I slipped on her dress. 'I went for six and crashed to the ground of the church and fell heavily on my arm in full view of everyone.' 'Most of the congregation didn't see what happened, but those around me were shocked to see me flying through the air. 'The bride and groom were quite upset by it all, but they were looking forward to their reception. 'The groom and best man very gallantly helped me up, and I waved to the organ player and sent them on their way down the aisle as husband and wife. 'Everything had gone absolutely perfectly up until then - but apparently I was quite professional about it all. 'It was a huge shock, nothing like this has ever happened to me before. 'I just stepped on the train of the bride's dress and it just felt like stepping on ice and I slipped and went flying through the air. 'I can definitely laugh at myself though and I have certainly been laughing at myself a lot since. 'The whole wedding was beautiful and now I think it will be very memorable for a whole host of reasons.' Mr and Mrs Stoddard (pictured with Reverend Scoones and another vicar) had a memorable day . The couple - who have been together for eight years and have children Libby, 5, and Finley, 7-months - unusually had two vicars conducting their wedding ceremony. Roger's tumble stuck in everyone's mind and the evening speeches soon turned to jokes about whether the vicar had fallen - or been tripped by Reverend Ken Kenrick. Mr Stoddard added: 'My best man's dad is also a vicar, so we made the choice to have two vicars at our wedding. 'But once we knew that Roger was okay, everyone soon started joking and said they saw Ken stick his leg out to trip him over.'

"Stonehenge was designed to light up carvings as though they were on display in a modern museum, a groundbreaking 3D scan of the iconic stones has found. The latest 3D laser technology revealed new evidence of the importance of the midwinter sunset to the ancient creators of Stonehenge, along with 71 new images invisible to the naked eye due to weathering of the stone. It suggests that the stonemasons used the best materials where the rays would hit the stone, ensuring they would glisten in the final light of the setting winter solstice sun, or at dawn on the longest day. Revealing: The new images suggests that the stonemasons used the best materials where the rays would hit them - shining in the last light of the setting winter solstice sun, or at dawn on the longest day . The scans revealed 'hidden' images on many of the stones. Here, arrow heads are clearly visible on stone 4 of Stonehenge. The laser scan has also revealed many . more prehistoric carvings, including 71 new images of Bronze Age axe . heads chipped into five of the giant stones, bringing the number of such carvings discovered at Stonehenge to . 115. The previously unknown Early Bronze Age carvings are invisible to the naked eye. To find them, researchers analysed 850 gigabytes of information. 3D scanners were used to record billions of points micro-topographically on the surfaces of the monument’s 83 surviving stones. Detailed analysis of that data carried out on behalf of English Heritage found images had been engraved on the stones. Researchers were able to virtually reconstruct parts of Stonehenge to get a closer look - this is stone 56 of the area. Secrets exposed: The latest 3D laser technology has revealed new evidence of the importance of the midwinter sunset to the ancient creators of Stonehenge . The team used complex laser Scanning at Stonehenge to gain new insight into the stones. 3D scanners and digital imaging cameras were used to record billions of points micro-topographically on the surfaces of the monument’s 83 surviving stones. Captured at a resolution of 0.5mm, it is the first time a consistent level of high-resolution data has been collected across all the stone surfaces. This was usually done by removing the top 1-3 millimetres of weathered (darker coloured) rock, to produce different sized shapes. Although now largely invisible to the naked eye, back in the Early Bronze Age the images would have been clearly visible on unweathered stone. The varying techniques and amounts of work confirms not only that the builders intended to align the monument on the axis of the sun at midsummer and midwinter, but also that the view from the north east was particularly important. Researchers said it was clear the stones were meant to be approached from the north east up the ancient processional avenue towards the direction of the midwinter sunset. Planning: Researchers said it was clear the stones were meant to be approached from the north east up the ancient processional avenue towards the direction of the midwinter sunset . Discovery: The researchers said that as other stones in the monument have more natural, less neat outlines, it seems that the creators were making a special effort to allow a dramatic passage of sunlight through the stone circle at midsummer and midwinter . Approaching and viewing the stone . circle from this direction meant the winter solstice sunset had . particular importance to prehistoric people, and efforts were made to . create a dramatic spectacle for those coming from the north east, . experts said. The stones in . the outer circle which could be seen on the approach from the north east . have been completely 'pick dressed', removing the brown and grey crust . of the rock on the surface to reveal the bright, grey-white underneath. But the outer faces of those on the other side of the outer circle were not worked in the same way. The . stones facing the north east are also the largest and most uniform, and . the lintels are very well-worked and finished compared to those . elsewhere in Stonehenge. Stones . that flanked the north east/south west axis of the summer and winter . solstices were most carefully worked to create straight and narrow . rectangular gaps. Shining through: The researchers said that as some stones in the monument have more natural, less neat outlines, it seems that the creators were making a special effort to allow a dramatic passage of sunlight through the stone circle at midsummer and midwinter . Study: Commissioned by English Heritage, the detailed laser scan and digital imaging of Stonehenge showed significant differences in how various stones were shaped and worked . The researchers said that as other . stones in the monument have more natural, less neat outlines, it seems . that the creators were making a special effort to allow a dramatic . passage of sunlight through the stone circle at midsummer and midwinter. Professor . Clive Ruggles, emeritus professor of achaeo-astronomy at University of . Leicester, said: 'This extraordinary new evidence not only confirms the . importance of the solstitial alignment at Stonehenge, but also show . unequivocally that the formal approach was always intended to be from . the north east, up the avenue towards the direction of midwinter sunset. 'We see how the utmost care and . attention was devoted to ensuring the pristine appearance of Stonehenge . for those completing their final approach to the monument at the two . times of the year when sunlight shines along the alignment - when those . approaching had the midsummer rising sun behind or midwinter setting sun . ahead.' English Heritage . said the new presentation of Stonehenge, which includes a new visitor . centre 1.5 miles away out of sight, involved closing the A344 to reunite . the stone circle with the avenue from which it was meant to be . approached.

"More than £12million was paid out in legal costs and compensation to asylum seekers and other immigrants last year, figures have showed. The UK Border Agency (UKBA) paid a total of £14.2million last year in compensation, legal costs and ex gratia payments, up almost £2million on the previous year, the agency's annual report for 2010/11 showed. This included payments to families who were unlawfully detained and removed, as well as £175,000 in compensation to an asylum seeker who was unlawfully detained and injured while in custody. The TaxPayers Alliance told Mail Online today that the money which is intended for frontline services when given by hard-pressed tax-payers is instead being 'wasted on compensation payments.' Bordering on the expensive: UKBA's annual report showed Britain paid a total of £14.2million last year to asylum seekers and immigrants . Legal costs alone topped £7.7million in just over 1,000 cases, compared with £3.8million for 691 cases in 2009/10. More than £4million was also paid out in 152 cases where each individual compensation payment was less than £250,000. This compared with 837 such cases in 2009/10 which led to £4.4million in compensation being paid. The UKBA report also said the agency had 'various legal claims which are currently outstanding' and had set aside £4million, 'based on past experience', for 'a number of cases of unlawful detention'. The TaxPayers Alliance today criticised the huge outlay as a 'waste'. 'Taxpayers shouldn’t be paying out millions every year for compensation claims, said Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers Alliance. Legal ruling: Failed asylum seekers won the right to claim damages after a High Court in January over three young children held at Yarl's Wood immigration detention centre . 'Whether it is the result of the UK . Border Agency’s failure to manage chaotic border controls, or dubious . cases in European courts where compensation isn’t really called for. 'Either way, action is needed to get . costs under control so that money intended for frontline services from . hard-pressed taxpayers isn’t wasted on compensation payments.' A UKBA spokeswoman said: 'Detention is a necessary part of the process to remove some individuals with no right to be here. At work: The UK Border Agency says it detains people when it believes it is reasonable and lawful to do so' 'Cases . vary from foreign national prisoners who have served their sentences . but are awaiting deportation, to failed asylum cases and individuals . found overstaying their visas. 'We use our powers to detain individuals when we believe it is reasonable and lawful to do so and regularly review the system.' In January, failed asylum seekers won the right to claim damages which could run into thousands of pounds after the High Court ruled that three young children were held at an immigration detention centre unlawfully. The ruling was a legal victory for the mothers - Reetha Suppiah, 37, a Malaysian nurse, and Sakinat Bello, 25, a Nigerian national - who brought the legal challenge. Both said a lack of safeguards at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire, the UK's main removal centre for women and minors, led to their children suffering distress and trauma. Mr Justice Wyn Williams, sitting in London, ruled that the Government's current policy on detaining families with children pending deportation was not unlawful, but - in the cases being considered - it had not been applied by the UKBA 'with the rigour it deserves'. As a result, 'the claimants were detained unlawfully from the time they were taken into custody until their release' and they were entitled to claim damages. The judge said: 'The cases of the two families involved in this litigation provide good examples of the failure by UKBA to apply important aspects of the policy, both when the decisions were taken to detain each family and when decisions were taken to maintain detention after removal directions had been cancelled.' Human rights act: Key compensation payments to victims were made under the families' rights to private and family life, and their right to liberty . The judge declared that the families' rights to private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been breached, along with their Article 5 right to liberty. But he rejected claims that their right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment had been infringed. Both mothers were failed asylum seekers arrested by UKBA officers in dawn raids on their homes last February. They were taken to Yarl's Wood for removal back to their country of origin on the basis that they had no right to remain in the UK. Ms Suppiah and her two boys, aged one and 11, were detained for 17 days, while Ms Bello and her two-year-old daughter were held for 12 days before being released and allowed back into the community pending their legal challenges.",TaxPayers Alliance says the money is being 'wasted'

"Smiling alongside his wife and children, this is the heroic doctor who drowned trying to save four teenage surfers caught in a deadly rip current.

His horrified wife is said to have looked on helplessly from the shore as he was dragged away by the current. Scroll down for videos . Devoted family man: Stuart Calder, left, with his wide Clare and four children. His youngest son's face is pixellated to protect his identity . Tragic: Stuart Calder, 52, a knee surgeon from Leeds, was among those who died after getting into difficulty in a rip current off Mawgan Porth Beach near Newquay, Cornwall. It is believed he had been surfing with his son . Beauty spot: A number of beach-goers alerted the Coastguard after three adults and four children were seen struggling in the water off Mawgan Porth Beach, Newquay. Above, rescue workers arrive at the scene . Concern: Police are tonight trying to trace the victims' next of kin. The youngsters, described as 'walking wounded', were seen crying as paramedics made desperate efforts to resuscitate the adults . The photo emerged as the RNLI came under criticism for failing to have lifeguards on the beach, with one surfer calling it an ‘avoidable tragedy’. Mr Calder was a devoted family man and a leading knee surgeon, who would have willingly ‘put himself in danger to save others’, a friend said yesterday. It is not yet known whether the group of boys involved in the ordeal – all of whom survived – included his own two teenaged sons. After the alarm was raised on Mawgan Porth beach in Cornwall on Sunday afternoon, Mr Calder joined a 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman in the water in a desperate bid to help. But the rescue attempt went tragically wrong. Video Source YouTube .

Paramedics were unable to save the woman and two men, who were later pronounced dead in hospital . Holiday destination: Marwgan Porth, halfway between Newquay and Cornwall, is popular with families. Police confirmed one man came from outside the Cornwall area, while the woman and other man were locals . Eventually the boys – two aged 18, one who was 16, and a 15-year-old – managed to make it back to the shore relatively unscathed. It is believed the wife of Mr Calder, 52, (pictured)  watched the tragic incident unfold from the shore . However the three adults had to be picked up by lifeboat and helicopter and brought back to the beach. Attempts to revive them failed, and all three died later in hospital. Last night the man and woman in their forties, who were from St Austell in Cornwall, had not yet been identified. But tributes were paid to Mr Calder, an orthopaedic consultant. He was visiting Mawgan Porth – near Newquay – during a holiday away from his £1million detached home in Leeds, where he lived with his wife Clare, also 52. It is not known whether any of their children – Cosima, 22, Lydia, 20, Hugo, 18, and Milo, 15 – were also on the beach at the time. Mr Calder was a consultant surgeon at the Yorkshire Knee Clinic in Leeds, and his father-in-law Sir Paul Girolami was chairman of GlaxoSmithKline. Eric Hanson, a US-based former schoolfriend, told the Mail: ‘Stuart was a respected doctor who was always generous to others. ‘It’s absolutely characteristic of him to put himself in danger to save others, especially children. He was a beloved man.’ He added that the catastrophe had ‘destroyed’ Mr Calder’s elderly parents, who were thought to be travelling to Cornwall yesterday. The precise sequence of events which led to the dramatic scene in front of hundreds of beachgoers is still being investigated. Investigation: A car believed to be linked to one of the victims remains taped off in the car park at Morgan Porth . Tributes: Flowers have been placed on sand dunes at the beauty spot in memory of those who died . Choppy: The conditions at Mawgan Porth beach were described as dangerous by eyewitnesses yesterday . Steve Instance, RNLI lifeguard manager for the South West, said: ‘From the reports we have, one of the people who drowned may have gone in to try to help the others. ‘We believe that the group of children may have been the first to get into difficulty.’ Rip currents are strong, narrow channels of water moving directly away from the shore. Sometimes wrongly referred to as rip tides, they are formed when a sandbank or other obstruction forces the water into a fast-moving jet – which can reach speeds of up to eight feet per second. Those caught in one can ultimately die of exhaustion, as they desperately try to swim against it straight back to shore. The currents can also cause swimmers to panic, which only makes the situation worse. Peter Stansby, a professor of fluid mechanics at the University of Manchester, advises anyone caught in a rip to let themselves to be carried out to sea until the current dissipates. They should then move to the side, out of its path, and allow themselves to be slowly carried towards the shore by the waves. Yesterday it came to light that lifeguards had ended their watch at the beach in September. But this policy is set to be reviewed after witnesses spoke of 6ft waves surrounding the stricken teenagers. The RNLI said its lifeguard patrols ran from March until the end of the summer. ‘Clear signs’ tell beachgoers that they are in an unprotected area, and emphasise the dangers of strong rip currents. A spokesman said they always review their commitment to various patrols of British beaches subject to their ‘limited resources’, with another adding that the number of half-term visitors to the beach will be ‘taken into account’. Yesterday surf instructor Gareth Bradley, 29, who works for Kingsurf surfing school at Mawgan Porth, called for a change in policy. He said: ‘It’s October half-term and a lot of people come on holiday. ‘The lifeguards finish at the end of September but if they … came back on for this week it would make all the difference. It was an avoidable tragedy. Having lifeguards on the beach would have saved lives.’ Last night a floral tribute to those who died could be seen propped up against the dunes. Stephen Gilbert, Lib Dem MP for St Austell and Newquay, praised the RNLI, but said questions remain over how late in the year beaches should be manned.

"Four Britons are believed to have died fighting alongside Al Qaeda in Syria. Three of the men, thought to be radicalised Muslims from London, were killed as they attacked pro-Bashar al-Assad forces near Aleppo. The men – one of whom has been named as Mohammed El-Araj, 23 – were killed in an explosion in August, the Times reported. The fourth was shot two weeks later while trying to ambush an enemy position. Deaths: And in November, Britons Mohammed el-Araj (left) and Abu Hujama al-Britani (right) were revealed to have been killed during an ambush on Assad forces. Above, the pair are joined by the soldier who trained them . Amid fears that hundreds of radicalised British Muslims have gone to Syria to fight holy war, the death of El-Araj, from west London, was confirmed by his family. On August 17, El-Araj’s sister tweeted: ‘The love I had for him, no one will understand'. Ifthekar Jaman told the BBC that he was fighting alongside Islamist rebels . Last night the Foreign Office confirmed it was investigating reports that four Britons were killed fighting Assad’s forces. El-Araj, the son of an antiques dealer, was brought up in the UK and was studying to become a mechanical engineer. In 2009, he was arrested following violent  protests outside the Israeli embassy and sent to prison for 18 months. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalistion (ICSR), a think-tank that tracks the movement of foreign fighters involved in Syria,  said El-Araj had been involved with jihadist organisations including Jabhat al-Nusra, a militant group aligned to Al Qaeda. Shiraz Maher, from ICSR, said El-Araj appeared to have had contact with Al Qaeda-linked groups. It is estimated there are between 200 and 350 Britons who have travelled to Syria to fight. British spies have also warned about ‘jihadi tourism’ in Syria and the threat young extremists pose when they return home. It is feared they could radicalise others on their return and train them in how to use weapons. A young British jihadi fighting in . Syria told BBC’s Newsnight that he had gone to the Arab country to fight . alongside Islamist rebels. The city of Aleppo has endured months of bitter fighting between rebels and pro-government forces . Ifthekar Jaman, 23, is fighting jihad or ‘holy war’ in Syria, having left his home in Portsmouth in the past few weeks. Jaman said it was his aim to create an Islamic state and he supported the principle of jihad. ‘The duty of a Muslim is to love jihad,’ he said. ‘One of the sayings of the prophet, peace be upon him, whoever does not go to jihad, or doesn’t even talk about it, dies with a characteristic of hypocrisy. 'I am actually a Muslim following the way I should be.’ He also said ‘volunteers’ from around the world had gone to Syria to help fight and the country did not need the West to intervene. Jamad is not the only young Muslim from Portsmouth who has gone to Syria. It is thought four or five others, who used to meet at their local mosque, have joined him.","Three of the men, thought to be radicalised Muslims from London, were killed as they attacked pro-Bashar al-Assad forces near Aleppo .

"Shocking: Phillip DeSelle confessed to murdering an 11-year-old girl who came to his Louisiana home to sell candy in 1990, but walked free after serving just half his sentence . Phillip DeSelle senselessly murdered an 11-year-old girl as she sold candy door-to-door in 1990. Despite having confessed and remained unrepentant, he walked out of prison a free man Friday. DeSelle, who said he 'just snapped' and killed Averie Evans and stashed her corpse in a Natchitoches, Louisiana Dumpster, had only served half of his original 50-year sentence. The now 65-year-old cold-blooded killer received that sentence prior to a change in Louisiana's so-called 'good time' laws, allowing him to cut his sentence fully in half with good behavior and his participation in self-improvement programs. DeSelle was sentenced at age 41 back in 1991 after he told police he opened his door to find Averie, snatched her from the porch and killed her. 'At the time we thought he would be in his 80s or 90 when he got out. You get some sense of peace with that,' Averie's aunt Erin Keyser told USA Today. Louisiana lawmakers changed the good time law in 1997 in order to ensure that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their prison term, which offers little but cold comfort to Averie's family. Horrific: Averie Evans was selling candy for a school fundraiser when DeSelle murdered her and stached her body in a Dumpster. Served half his sentence: DeSelle benefited from a since-changed law allowing violent Louisiana criminals to shave off as much as half their sentences with good behavior and self-improvement programs . Keyser created a Facebook page in honor of Averie's memory soon after learning of DeSelle's early release. A January 22 post read: . 'Another day has dawned and our Averie is still gone, and now her killer walks free. The cold, gray rain outside matches our grief.' According to KLFY, DeSelle has chosen to live int he Bayou Chicot area in central Lousiana. DeSelle's release is one of many slaps in the face that Averie's family has endured. Not only was her killer unrepentant about his crime, the little girl's body was never found. 'He's an evil man. He never showed any remorse or regret,' Keyser said. DeSelle told authorities he'd dumped her body in an area Dumpster, but searches came up empty. Averie's body was never found even after DeSelle's confession, so prosecutors charged and got DeSelle convicted of just manslaughter and kidnapping . The case was reopened years later and authorities dug up the driveway of DeSelle's former home in search of Averie's remains, to no avail. While her death did put a stop to children raising funds door-to-door for a time, even that effect of the heinous crime didn't last. Nonetheless, Keyser, with the help of her Facebook page Justice for Averie, continues her fight with the help of other outraged members of her community. 'Our only recourse is to warn people, Keyser told USA Today. 'The main thing is to protect the children, that no family will have to go through this devastation.' 'Our only recourse is to warn people, Averie's aunt Erin Keyser said.

"Pennsylvania's highest court has ruled that it will not review Jerry Sandusky's child molestation conviction. Other legal avenues remain open to the former Penn State assistant football coach but the Pennsylvania Supreme court ruled against him on Wednesday on his latest call for appeal. Sandusky had asked the court to take up his 45-count conviction, arguing his lawyers were rushed too quickly to trial in 2012 and that prosecutors improperly made reference to his decision not to testify. He also said the trial judge should have issued a jury instruction about how long it took his victims to report the abuse and that jurors should not have been told to weigh evidence of his good character against all other evidence. Staying in jail: Jerry Sandusky will not be granted an appeal on his child molestation conviction, as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled against him today (pictured in January 2013) Sandusky defense attorney Norris Gelman said he was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision, which was issued in the form of a one-sentence order. Sandusky has the right to file a new appeal. 'I'm sure he will,' Gelman said. Attorney General Kathleen Kane, whose office prosecuted Sandusky, issued a statement saying she was pleased with the decision. Breaking her silence: His wife Dottie Sandusky (pictured in 2012) spoke out in an interview last month declaring his innocence . 'Protecting Pennsylvania's children is one of my top priorities and I remain committed to seeking justice for all victims of sexual abuse,' Kane said. The prosecutor's office had said that Sandusky did not provide sufficient basis for the Supreme Court to take up the matter and that decisions made by the trial judge did not violate his rights. Michael Boni, a lawyer who represents Aaron Fisher and other Sandusky victims, said the Supreme Court made the right call. 'Hopefully this will, once and for all, put to bed any lingering hopes that Jerry will have his sentence reversed, his convictions reversed,' Boni said. 'It's a happy day for the victims.' Sandusky, 70, is serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence for sexual abuse of 10 boys. Gelman said Sandusky can file a new appeal under the state's Post Conviction Relief Act. That appeal, he said, could address any newly discovered evidence as well as any claims that Sandusky's lawyers were not effective. Sandusky also could eventually take his case to federal court. Eight of his victims testified at trial, describing a range of abuse from grooming and fondling to oral and anal sex, including attacks in the basement of Sandusky's home outside State College. Another witness, a graduate assistant for the team who had been a quarterback for the Nittany Lions, testified he saw Sandusky having sexual contact with a boy inside a team shower late on a Friday night. Sandusky did not testify on his own behalf but has maintained his innocence. His lawyer has said the victims' testimony was motivated by a desire to cash in. Penn State announced last year it was paying $59.7million to 26 people who had raised claims of abuse at Sandusky's hands. Hoping for a retrial: Sandusky said that his lawyers were rushed when he was first tried in 2011 (pictured then) His defense lawyers repeatedly sought delays before trial, saying they were swamped by an enormous amount of material from prosecutors and needed more time to examine the background of his accusers. During a post-sentencing hearing, however, defense attorney Joe Amendola acknowledged that he had not discovered anything afterward that would have changed his trial strategy. Sandusky's 2011 arrest led to the firing of Hall of Fame football coach Joe Paterno and significant penalties levied against the school by the NCAA. Paterno was stripped of 111 of his 409 career wins while the school was fined $60million, banned from bowl games for four years and faced steep scholarship cuts. Three other high-ranking school officials, including the then-president, face charges they covered up complaints about Sandusky. Their case has not yet gone to trial.","The former Penn State assistant football coach wanted a retrial .

"Almost 50,000 prisoners detained by Gaddafi's regime are missing amid fears that many are trapped in secret bunkers abandoned by their captors. Rebel leaders estimate that 60,000 opponents of the tyrant have been locked up since the insurgency began in February, but only 11,000 were freed. Many are believed to have been slaughtered in mass executions of opposition fighters and their supporters by retreating Gaddafi loyalists. Relief: Political prisoners from Abu Sleem prison cheer as they arrive on a ferry from Tripoli at the Benghazi main harbour . Others are believed to be still alive . but left to starve in underground chambers which the dictator's forces . have deserted since the fall of Tripoli. Rebels and humanitarian groups are racing against time to locate the bunkers and release the captives. Gaddafi fighters captured tens of thousands of rebels and their supporters during the battle for Benghazi and other cities. Thousands more civilians accused of . backing the rebels were detained in a series of security crackdowns as . Gaddafi desperately tried to stop the revolution spreading to Tripoli. Horror: A rebel fighter looks at burnt bodies at the Khamis military encampment in Tripoli . Shocking: The bodies found in Tripoli are believed to be Libyan civilians arrested by pro-Gaddafi loyalists for interrogation and then executed as Libyan rebel forces advanced . Col Ahmed Omar Bani, a rebel military . leader, said: ‘The number of people arrested over the past months is . estimated at between 57,000 and 60,000. ‘Between 10,000 and 11,000 prisoners have been freed up until now ... so where are the others?’ He added: ‘Many people in Tripoli are now discovering mass graves around former detention centres and the prison in Abu Slim. ‘We have names of individuals who . know what happened with the prisoners in Tripoli and these individuals . are currently being sought by our liberation forces. We invite anyone . who has information on prisoners to come forward.’ A dismayed Col Bani said it would be ‘catastrophic’ if they had been murdered. In action: The RAF Sentinel R1 aircraft has been called in to try and pinpoint the whereabouts of Gaddafi and his family . Foreign Secretary William Hague has described Colonel Gaddafi as . 'delusional' as rumours circulate that the dictator has fled to Algeria . Meanwhile, Britain stepped up the hunt for Colonel Gaddafi yesterday as mystery continued to surround his whereabouts. RAF . spy planes, crack SAS troops and MI6 intelligence experts all joined . the search for the tyrant amid rumours that he had fled Libya. Speculation that he had escaped into . Algeria began after a convoy of six armoured Mercedes cars crossed the . border near the southern town of Ghadames. Ministers in Algiers were forced to deny that he had sought shelter in their country. There were also rumours that Gaddafi . would seek sanctuary with one of two other despots, Robert Mugabe in . Zimbabwe or Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, and that some members of his . family had gone to Europe. However, Gaddafi’s spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said  the toppled leader was still  in Libya. In . a phone call to the Associated Press news agency in New York, he  said . Gaddafi was ready to begin talks to hand power to the rebels. Negotiations would be led by Gaddafi’s son, Saadi, who said he wanted to prevent Tripoli becoming ‘a sea of blood’. Foreign Secretary William Hague . described the ousted dictator as ‘delusional’ and the National . Transitional Council, the rebel government, rejected the offer and said . he was a criminal who would be put on trial if captured. Gaddafi loyalists are continuing to fight the insurgents – particularly around Gaddafi’s home town of Sirte. Some rebel commanders believe Gaddafi and his inner circle have fled there as it is his last pocket of support in Libya. Pro-democracy leaders are holding negotiations with Sirte’s elders to . try to force a peaceful surrender of the town, which would be a huge . symbolic victory, but so far have failed to broker a deal. Crack soldiers from 22 SAS are understood to be operating in Sirte to help prise the town from the regime’s clutches. The RAF’s Sentinel R1  surveillance aircraft is being used to try to pinpoint Gaddafi and his family moving around the country. The aircraft is kitted out with radar and eavesdropping equipment so sensitive that it can intercept mobile phone calls. Tornado and Typhoon fighter jets are also on standby to attack the dictator’s bunkers and hideouts. Experts believe Gaddafi will lie low and avoid armoured or large convoys which could be spotted by spy planes. He is also likely to avoid using phones in case intelligence agencies detect his voice patterns.","Mass graves being discovered around detention centres .

"Britain's 'most vulgar' car, a Mercedes CLS 350 encrusted with one million Swarovski crystals has been sold on eBay for more than £150,000. Daria Radionova, a 21-year-old Russian student, listed the car on the online auctioneers after attracting attention in Knightsbridge, her plush west London stomping ground. Bids quickly escalated above £100,000, with the auction closing at £154,600 today after more than two dozen offers. Scroll down for video . The Mercedes CLS 350, covered with a million Swarovski crystals, sold on eBay for more than £150,000 . Bling: The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate 'BAII BYY' After bidding opened at almost £90,000, the car was sold today after more than a week of bids for £154,600 . But despite vowing to donate proceeds of the sale to charity, Miss Radionova has revealed only some of the six-figure sum will be given to Manchester and Cheshire Dog's Home which perished in a fire earlier this year. Speaking before its sale, the privileged youngster said: 'The car is now for sale in the eBay charity auction. 'A part from the sale will go to support Manchester and Moldova Dog Homes.' It seems Miss Radionova was unsure of the website however, uploading a photograph of the listing this evening asking: 'Is eBay a serious auction btw guys? (sic)' The London-based student, who lives 300 feet from her favourite shop Harrods, boasted before putting the silver-coloured coupe on sale: 'When I sell the car I will give the money to charity.' It was not clear last night if any other causes would benefit from the glittering car which was valued at around £25,000. Miss Radionova disputed this, stating: 'The car cost at least £50,000, then I spent over £20,000 on the Swarovski crystals for it. 'It cost me another £15,000 to fly in my team from Russia to put them on the car for me. 'They spent 12 hours a day for two months doing it. I'm very happy with it - everywhere I go, people look at it.' The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate BAII BYY. Magnet for theft: Daria Radionova said: 'It's quite scary to leave it in the street. People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone' The registration was a present from her brother 'to make sure my car was extra-unique'. The eBay site says the starting bid was for £89,999.00. Twenty-five offers had been made before the final bid today. Asked on Facebook why she was helping dogs rather than children, orphans or disabled people, she snapped back: 'Help them yourself.' Any buyers should be ready for unexpected attention with a car that has had two previous owners and 57,000 miles on the clock. 'It's quite scary to leave it in the street,' she said. 'People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone. 'But I enjoy it. I know some people say negative things but I don't care what people think.'

"Jennifer Pan was sentenced to life in prison after hatching a fake home invasion in order to try and murder her parents in November 2010 . An Ontario judge called a Toronto woman's plot to have her parents killed in their own home an 'unfathomable' betrayal before sentencing her to life in prison. Jennifer Pan, 28, was convicted of first-degree murder as well as attempted murder in December 2014. The attack she arranged on Nov. 8, 2010, left her mother Bieh Ha Pan dead and father Hann Pan with a serious head wound. She was found guilty alongside Pan were her boyfriend Daniel Wong and the two thugs she hired to help carry out her diabolical plot--Lenford Crawford and David Mylvaganam. According to the prosecution, Pan was obsessed with Wong and snapped when her parents forbade her from seeing him. All four got life sentences Friday with no parole chances for parole for 25 years on the murder conviction and life for attempted murder with the sentences to be served concurrently, the National Post reports. The trial for fifth person, Eric Carty, has yet to begin. Judge Cary Boswell said he handed down the maximum sentence for attempted murder because Hann Pann only survived the 'crime of terrifying violence' through sheer luck. 'Each of the offenders knew that he or she was involved in a murder plot,' and understood the 'abject immorality' of it, Boswell said. Pan's family members did not attend the trial. However her father and brother did send written statements. Hann Pan wrote: 'When I lost my wife, I lost my daughter at the same time. On the day Bieh died, I feel I died too.' Pan said he cannot work and has been unable to return to the family home since the attack. And with the murder case so widely known, it has been impossible to sell the house. 'I hope my daughter Jennifer thinks about what happened to her family and can become a good, honest person someday,' he wrote. Pan's brother, Felix, says the murders will follow him the rest of his life. The attack she arranged on Nov. 8, 2010, left her mother Bieh Ha Pan dead and father Hann Pan with a serious head wound . On November 8, 2010, Pan, Wong, Crawford and Mylvaganam--and, allegedly, a third thug named Eric Carty, who will stand trial at a later date--entered Pan's parent's home . The Toronto Sun reports that Pan spent years lying about her relationship with Wong and even lied to her parents about attending a university--to which her father paid tuition--in order to be with him. She was actually living with Wong in a nearby town and when her parents caught wind of the deceit, they ordered her home. That, prosecutors say, is when Pan started to hatch her murder plot. She paid her drug dealer boyfriend's drug contact friends $10,000 to help her carry out the deed, reports the National Post. Hann Pan wrote: 'When I lost my wife, I lost my daughter at the same time. On the day Bieh died, I feel I died too' On November 8, 2010, Pan, Wong, Crawford and Mylvaganam--and, allegedly, a third thug named Eric Carty, who will stand trial at a later date--entered Pan's parent's home. Her mother would later be found dead of a point-blank gun shot wound. Her father was shot in the face and placed in a medically induced coma for days, reports the Toronto Star. Hours earlier, Pan had sat at her parents' kitchen table and laughed with them as they ate dinner. On Saturday, Pan and three others stood in court where they were all deemed guilty of first degree murder. Mandatory sentencing requires they serve at least 25 years in prison before the possibility of parole. All will receive life sentences at a formal hearing scheduled for January 23. Pan enlisted the help of her drug dealer boyfriend Daniel Wong (pictured) for the devious crime, which left her mother dead and her dad seriously injured with a bullet to the face .

Zaragoza needed to win their last game of the 2010-11 season to stay up and beat Levante 2-1 away from home with Herrera playing 72 minutes before being substituted. Herrera was on the verge of a move to Athletic Bilbao when the game was played and moved shortly after the season ended. There were suspicions over the game before it was even played with Deportivo president Augusto Lendoiro (whose team ended up going down) hinting at foul play from then Zaragoza president Agapito Iglesias. Iglesias remains at the centre of the anticorruption investigation and will also be called to give evidence. The Spaniard started well at Manchester United but has been an unused substitute in recent matches . Former Zaragoza president Agapito Iglesias (right) remains at the centre of an anticorruption investigation . Former Zaragoza captain Gabi, now at Atletico Madrid, admitted he received a sum of money from Iglesias . Last month Zaragoza captain Gabi admitted receiving a sum of money into his bank account from Iglesias in the week before the game. He says he was asked to draw this money out and return it in cash to his president. And Herrera is believed to be one of seven other players who, along with coach Aguirre, also received a payment from the president. Iglesias has claimed that the money was a bonus to the players. But Gabi is understood to have told investigators bonuses were never paid before games and that the sum was returned immediately to Iglesias. Zaragoza were about to go into administration at the time and Gabi is understood to have told investigators he believed that the request from his president was related to this process, suggesting that the players were simply doing what the club had told them to do. Gabi was one of several players interviewed in October but with the case now set to go to court Herrera will have to go to Valencia to give evidence and his then coach Aguirre will have to return from Japan and do likewise.

"Tran Qui used a bunsen burner to roast the cat called Mungo who belonged to a local pensioner . A Vietnamese man living in Germany has admitted killing and barbecuing his neighbour's cat - and was then bemused to find himself at the wrath of animal lovers. 'What's wrong with eating a cat?' said Tran Qui who used a bunsen burner to roast the cat called Mungo who belonged to a local pensioner. Now local pet owners have put a cat curfew on their furry friends leaving home in the Rhineland town of Andernach as it is feared Qui may have scoffed 30 cats which have gone missing in recent months. Police said they are investigating him for breaching both animal cruelty laws and hygiene regulations. These specifically forbid consuming pets for food. If charged he could face up to three years behind bars. A police spokesman said: 'He grilled the animal using a Bunsen burner in the courtyard of his block of flats. It is not uncommon in Asian cultures to eat cat meat. But it is not acceptable in Germany.' Outraged neighbour Christina Sarwatka, cuddling her moggy Billy, said: 'Thirty cats have gone missing recently around here. I cannot let Billy out anymore. I am scared to death he will be eaten.' Qui, a father of five, has lived in the town for two years and said he missed the 'tastes of home' - so he cooked the cat and ate it with a dip made of fish sauce, lime juice, coriander and garlic. Despite an official ban on eating cats, restaurants in the Vietnam still offer the forbidden meat on their menus. In fact, even in the Southeast Asian nation cat owners fear for their animals’ safety as the consumption of feline meat appears to be on the rise. A snack of cat meat - colloquially known as 'little tiger' - is typically served with beer and eaten at the beginning of the lunar month. Cats being sold for meat typically fetch from $50 to $70, depending on the size, which is a hefty sum for many in the impoverished nation. While cat traders claim to breed the animals legitimately, there are hardly any regulations in place to verify this, so pet owners feat that their beloved moggies will be snatched to keep up with demand. Feline meat is a delicacy in Vietnam. This picture  shows a cook preparing  a dish  with cat meat  at a restaurant in the country's capital Hanoi. The enduring popularity of 'little tiger' as a snack to accompany a beer in Vietnam means that cat owners live in constant fear of animal snatchers, despite an official ban .","Tran Qui used a bunsen burner to roast the cat belonging to  pensioner .

"The PBS series Antiques Roadshow hit a home run with a collection of 1870s Boston baseball memorabilia. A trove of signatures and rare baseball cards from Boston Red Stockings players was appraised at $1 million for insurance purposes, series producer Marsha Bemko said. She said it's the largest sports memorabilia find in the history of the 19-year-old public TV show, which travels America looking for varied heirlooms and treasures. Amazing: A trove of signatures and rare baseball cards from Boston Red Stockings players was appraised at $1 million for insurance purposes by Antiques Roadshow appraisers last Saturday . Family heirloom: The owner inherited it from her great-great-grandmother, who ran a Boston boarding house where the team lived in 1871-72 and some of baseball's first professional players were counted among her relative's patrons--they even wrote compliments to her food in their inscriptions on the cards . Thrilled: Antiques Roadshow appraiser Leila Dunbar called it one of the most exciting appraisals of her career on the 19-year-old show . The collection was brought to an Antiques Roadshow taping Saturday in New York City. The owner inherited it from her great-great-grandmother, who ran a Boston boarding house where the team lived in 1871-72. 'It was just sitting in here in a desk drawer,' the owner said as she held up a booklet that held the cards. 'I ran across it one day and decided I'd like to have it, not realizing at all what it was worth.' The owner's identity was kept private for security reasons, PBS said Monday. The collection had not been formally valued before but the owner had once received a $5,000 offer, PBS said. 'Crown jewels': According to Antiques Roadshow appraiser Leila Dunbar, the 'crown jewel' of the items is a May 1871 letter to the Boston with notes from three future Hall of Fame members: Albert Spalding, the future sporting good magnate, and brothers Harry (right) and George Wright (left). Harry managed the Red Stockings and his brother George would become baseball's original superstar . Personal notes: The owner's identity was kept private for security reasons.

According to Antiques Roadshow appraiser Leila Dunbar, the 'crown jewel' of the items is a May 1871 letter to the Boston landlady that includes notes from three future Hall of Fame members: Albert Spalding, the future sporting good magnate, and brothers Harry and George Wright. Dunbar explained: . 'When you look at memorabilia and you value it, you look at the historical importance of the players, of the team, of the era, of the event. 'You also look at rarity, you look at condition, you look at provenance . 'And this has it all,' she said. The letter included the players' appreciation for their host's cooking. True originals: Pictured in this illustration while still a Cincinnati team, the Red Stockings became the first ever professional baseball team in 1869 .

"Try as he might, Alastair Cook just cannot rid himself of Kevin Pietersen. As England crashed to another one-day defeat, this time by eight wickets with more than 10 overs to spare, Cook’s former team-mate and unfailing bête noire was calling for his resignation on Twitter. The worry for Cook, as Sri Lanka moved with embarrassing ease into a 2-0 lead in this seven-match series, is that Pietersen was able to do so without sounding bitter. ‘Dear Alastair,’ he tweeted, ‘if you care about England's chances this winter, pls resign and just concentrate on Test cricket... ‪#getHalesin’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sri Lankan and English captains paying tribute to Phillip Hughes . England's batsman Jos Buttler looks back at his wicket after being bowled during the second ODI . Kumar Sangakkara nudges the ball for a single during the Sri Lankan reply in Colombo . Alex Hales, the talented Nottinghamshire opener who has watched both defeats in Colombo from the pavilion, might not have saved England as they slumped to a dismal 185. But his selection alone might just have lifted a few spirits. And England’s spirits need lifting – the captain’s more than anyone’s. Since Cook led England to the final of the Champions Trophy on home soil in 2013, he has presided over 11 losses in 16 one-day internationals. One of his five wins came against Scotland. Chris Woakes celebrates after dismissing Tillakaratne Dilshan but England struggled to grab hold of the game . Mahela Jayawardena sweeps beyond leg slip Ian Bell as the hosts romped home to victory . Jayawardena knocks past the dejected Buttler and England captain Alastair Cook on Saturday . Thisara Perera wheels away after taking the wicket of the tourists' danger man Eoin Morgan . England’s lone series victory in that period – earlier this year in the Caribbean – came when Stuart Broad was in charge. And there are a maximum of 10 games left before the World Cup starts on February 14. Time is running out. Cook the batsman is faring little better. The 22 he made in 37 balls here meant he has now gone 55 innings without a century in both Tests and one-day internationals. Informed of Pietersen’s observation, he offered a weary grin: ‘Good job I’m not on social media. People are totally entitled to their view. That’s the nature of the beast when you’re on the outside. People believe what they want to believe. Moeen Ali lumbers off the field after Dilshan bowled the opener, who made just two at the top of the order . Tailender Steven Finn can't believe the shot he played to Ajantha Mendis as Sri Lanka took control . ‘In our dressing-room, we’ve got to stay strong as a group. We’re the guys who have the honour of playing for England at this precise moment in time, and we’re the guys who have got the opportunity of turning it round – not other people on the outside.’ It has been a tough few days for the England captain, who had spent the build-up to this match presiding over a squad still coming to terms with the death of Australian batsman Phil Hughes. For a while, the day proceeded in an air of unreality. A book of condolences was signed, a minute’s silence observed, and flags flown at half-mast above the Premadasa Stadium’s giant scoreboard. As if to honour Hughes, who died after being hit by a bouncer, the first short ball did not arrive until the 28th over. But if the players have felt his death strongly, especially the trio who once counted him as a county colleague – Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan and Steven Finn – then there should be no mistake: England wanted to win this game. More than that, they needed to. Supporters paid tribute to Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes, who died earlier this week . Ravi Bopara was handed a reprieve when dropped by Angelo Mathews and went on to make a fifty . Instead, they managed only eight boundaries in 43 overs after rain had cut the match to 45 a side. Only Ravi Bopara and Joe Root passed 22. England’s bowlers were then effortlessly manoeuvred this way and that by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. For the 15th time, these old friends added over 100 together. They have more than 25,000 one-day runs between them. These are stats of which England can only dream. By no stretch of the imagination was this an equal contest. But it was England’s batting that let them down. Moeen Ali, fresh from a sparkling century three days earlier, fell in the second over to the off-breaks of Tillekeratne Dilshan, who then persuaded the strokeless Cook to slog-sweep to deep square leg. In between, Ian Bell picked out long-off. Later, Eoin Morgan added to his own growing catalogue of cheap dismissals. Bopara was the only England batsman to really harm the home bowlers during a limp display . Morgan trudges off after failing to kick on after making a start . Root and Bopara, with his second half-century of the series, did their best, but England did not look like a side capable of curing all their ills in time for the World Cup. Hales and his county colleague James Taylor are itching for a go. But as long as England keep losing and Cook keeps failing, there will be only one question in town. Cook admitted: ‘You feel the heat when you’re not scoring runs. It’s only natural for anyone. I’ve just to keep doing what I’m doing. I’ve got to believe in myself and do my basics well.’ Does this result shake his faith in what he’s trying to do with his team? ‘No, I don’t think it does. I thought we took a lot out of the way we went about the first game. It’ll be a dent in our confidence. How we respond will be really important.’ The next game is on Wednesday in Hambantota. For England and Cook, it has already assumed the proportions of a must-win.","Sri Lanka beat England by eight wickets in second one-day international .

"A passenger on a Newark-bound United Airlines flight was taken into custody after he allegedly began screaming that he had secrets from the CIA and repeatedly mentioned the name of NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Jacques Roizen, one of a handful of people who were forced to restrain the man, told ABC News that the disturbed passenger stood up and began frantically shouting about 10 hours into the 16-hour flight from Hong Kong. The man was frightened and believed he had been poisoned, Roizen said. He pleaded for the flight to be diverted to Canada.

"A Lithuanian builder was held last night after a wealthy property developer and his wife were found dead. Viktoras Bruzas, 38, went on the run following the fatal stabbing of Patrick Kettyle, 55, and his wife Gillian Kettyle, 54, in an attack at their £750,000 Surrey home. After a ten-hour manhunt Bruzas was stopped by police in his Mercedes at 6pm last night in Oxshott, Surrey, just five miles from the scene of the double murder. Surrey Police had been urgently searching for 38-year-old Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas (right) after the bodies of married couple Patrick (left), 55, and Gillian Kettyle, 54, were discovered at about 12.30am yesterday . Mr Kettyle (pictured) and his wife  are said to have known Bruzas, and the two suspects were also known to each other . Police had been called just after midnight yesterday by Mrs Kettyle’s 16-year-old son Timothy, who is said to have witnessed a knifeman lashing out, stabbing his victims in the chest, head and legs. Paramedics tried to save the couple but they died at the scene. Kristina Bruziene, is reportedly the estranged wife of Bruzas. She was employed by the dead couple as a secretary in 2012 . Police confirmed that Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each other, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation. Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm after the builder introduced them. Bruzas grew up in Kaunas, Lithuania, the country’s second biggest city, 65 miles west of the capital, Vilnius. He married his wife in Lithuania before they moved to the UK in their twenties. The couple settled in Forest Gate, East London, and had their son Richard, who was born in September 2007. Bruzas was known by his neighbours as a quiet man who worked hard to support his family, doing odd jobs in people’s homes and fixing locks. Apparently earning well, he moved with his family five years ago to a £400,000 home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. Bruzas was working as a builder for Mr Kettyle’s construction firm while his wife handled the accounts. Pictures posted on Facebook suggest they were happy, devoted parents. A window at the Kettyle's home appears to have been smashed. The middle-aged couple were found by a family member who was not hurt in the attack, police revealed at a press conference . A forensics officer collects a knife in Fetcham, Surrey, where the couple were found (right) but it is too early at this stage to tell whether it was used in the killings. Forensic officers were in the house (left) A police spokesman said: 'A potential weapon has been found near the property and we are currently examining it. But we cannot confirm if it is linked to the incident at this early stage' A forensics officer could be seen putting the knife, which had a black and silver handle and appeared to have a bent and broken blade, into a plastic evidence container . Last night another man in his 30s arrested in Walton-on-Thames on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder was released on police bail. Police were called at around 12.30am on Thursday and issued an appeal seven hours later to find Bruzas, whom they believed was on his way to West Sussex. But he was later found just five miles away and arrested on suspicion of murder. Last night detectives were examining a knife with a broken blade found by a dog walker not far from the murder scene, in the leafy stockbroker village of Fetcham. A forensic officer photographs evidence.The knife was found 400 metres away from the couple's home . Aerial pictures of the Kettyle's home shows police tape cordoning off the house and garden as officers stand guard . A number of construction companies are registered to the address under Mr Kettyle's name . The house where the bodies were found is a two-storey detached house with a brick-paved drive and neat bushes at the front, the second house along The Copse . The killer is believed to have smashed a glass window in a conservatory at the rear of the house to gain entry. Stunned neighbours described the Kettyles as a quiet, friendly couple who were often seen taking Mrs Kettyle’s son to his grammar school in Guildford where he recently achieved top GCSE grades. The couple married in 2004 and have three children between them from previous marriages. Last night Mrs Kettyle’s stunned niece and nephew Bronwyn, 21, and Lewis Davies, 18, said: ‘It’s the worst thing that could have happened. They were fantastic people. It’s so sad for the whole family. ‘They didn’t deserve this. It’s a tragic loss. Patrick was such a gentle man, he was always so loving. It just doesn’t feel real at all, it’s such a shock.’ Suspect Bruzas, is from Lithuania and lives in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey . A blue tent was also set up next to the cordon. Detective Superintendent Nick May of Surrey Police said at the scene that Bruzas and the victims were known to each other . Officers carried out a fingertip search of Meadow Way, checking gardens and hedges, emptying household bins and probing building work in a front garden .

He is understood to have retired, but it is thought his wife worked as an office administrator in nearby Cobham, Surrey. The Kettyles were close friends of Friends Reunited founders Steve and Julie Pankhurst who made £30million from the sale of the site in 2005. Neighbour Gwynaeth Laxton, 80, said: ‘I am in complete shock and feeling quite shaken up about it. We had not long been asleep when we heard a commotion outside. ‘I thought it was foxes or other animals jumping over the fence. But then a short while later we heard the police turn up.’ Speaking at a press conference, Detective Superintendent Nick May, said the couple had been subjected to a 'sustained attack' The victims were found with stab wounds after the attack at The Copse in Fetcham, Surrey .

"A distraught mother told last night how she watched in horror as her estranged husband shot their seven-year-old daughter dead. Lyndsey Shipstone, 42, spoke for the first time about her terror as Egyptian-born Yasser Alromisse carried out the cold-blooded killing as revenge for her turning her back on Islam. Alromisse, 46, shot their daughter Mary in the head on the doorstep of her home as she returned from primary school on September 11. ‘It was just an ordinary day. Mary had come home from school. She was holding her violin,’ Miss Shipstone said. ‘We walked to the house. There was nothing extraordinary. We’d just picked up one of the local cats that waited for her. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Lyndsey Shipstone has desribed the moment her daughter Mary was shot in the head by estranged partner Yasser Alromisse as the pair returned home from school . ‘It waited for her every day when she came home from school. We were holding her and just walking down the path and were going to give her some food, like we did every day. As soon as I put the front door key in there was a terrible bang behind me. I turned round – and Mary was on the ground.’ Alromisse shot the girl again before fleeing to his car. ‘I saw her father with the gun in his hand pointing at Mary’s head and he fired a second time, and then he retreated into the car and I just dropped down to Mary and dragged her round the front of the house away from the car,’ Miss Shipstone said. ‘I was screaming for help and I was telling neighbours who were calling the police that he had a gun and Mary had been shot. I realised I had to get her away.’ Joy: This photo shows Mary's delight as she unwrapped her Christmas presents . She tried desperately to save her daughter but despite her efforts, Mary – who would have been eight last week – died the following day at King’s College Hospital in London. By the time police arrived, Alromisse had turned the gun on himself in his car, which he had parked in a driveway beside the three-bedroom house. Miss Shipstone had spent years hiding from Alromisse and had apparently begged lawyers not to tell him that she and Mary were living in the quiet village of Northiam, East Sussex. Authorities face serious questions over how he found out where they were. Miss Shipstone married Alromisse, a council community safety officer, in Liverpool in 2005 after converting to Islam, friends said. But she rejected his faith and left with Mary and her son Stephen, 21, from a previous relationship. Miss Shipstone had recently started seeing a new partner and apparently planned legal action over the custody of Mary. But she could not understand why Alromisse would kill their child. The couple’s bitter custody battle ended in tragedy last week when Alromisse shot his daughter in the head outside her mother’s house before killing himself . Ms Shipstone said she could not fathom Alromisse's motivation and was 'taking each day as it comes' She agreed for Mary’s organs to be donated, which has saved five other children, including two babies. She said: ‘It was important to allow Mary to make that gift of her organs because she was such a healthy girl. ‘I thought it would be a way of Mary living on in these children in some small way.’ A memorial fund has been set up for Mary, whom Miss Shipstone described as lively and intelligent. She said she took ‘great comfort’ in having been with her daughter during her final moments, but added: ‘You can’t describe the horror that I’ve felt losing my precious daughter. ‘I’d hoped that she would survive. But it wasn’t to be.’ Special day: Mary on her baptism day in 2013 (left). Her organs have been donated to five other children . Mary was left in a life-threatening condition following the shooting and the youngster, who lived with Ms Shipstone and her brother, died from her injuries the following day .

"The unclaimed bodies of 13 military veterans were finally laid to rest in side-by-side plots following a poignant 60-mile funeral procession yesterday. The dead soldiers, seven of whom served in Vietnam, were driven from a morgue in Detroit to Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly Township, Michigan - their hearses flanked by state troopers on motorbikes. All of the men died alone in the last three years, but tragically, their remains were left unclaimed at the Wayne County medical examiner's office. Ex-servicemen and state troopers stand to attention as the 13 veterans are laid to rest at Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly Township, Michigan yesterday . While some fought in Vietnam, others served as far back as the 1950s - with at least one going to fight in the Korean War. The veterans were identified by the Missing in America Project, who 'locate and inter the unclaimed remains of American veterans through the joint efforts of private, state and federal organizations'. Sadly, they were among 200 unclaimed bodies from the same morgue, which have all now been buried - as the county could not bear the cost of holding on to them. Of the 13 who were laid to rest with full military honors, only one - Vietnam-era veteran Roland Dukes - had a family member present who received a flag from the casket. Shimeca Jackson, Mr Dukes' niece, said: 'We appreciate them honoring him. A lot of time has passed by. It was a beautiful ceremony.' Shimeca Jackson (right) was the only family member present at the funeral, being the niece of Vietnam-era veteran Roland Dukes .

David Techner, funeral director of the Ira Kaufman Chapel in Southfield and a member of the coalition responsible for the burials, said having 'hundreds of bodies stacked up in the morgue' will never happen again. He stated that the group have come up with 'Initiative 91', which calls for the coalition to step in and either bury or cremate a body that is not claimed within 90 days. Major Carl Livingston, a chaplain with the Army National Guard, said during the service that 'all service members just want to return home'. The men were identified by the Missing in America Project, which also organised yesterday's funeral . All of the men died in the last three years, but tragically, their remains were left unclaimed at the Wayne County medical examiner's office . He added: 'These men did just that. Rest in peace, dear brothers-in-arms.' He then offered a moving salute to the 13 flag-draped caskets behind him. The Jewish Fund played a key role in coordinating the burials. Their chairman, Dr. Richard Krugel, said: 'This brings to an end a very tragic time in our community,'","Former soldiers were among 200 unclaimed bodies in a Detroit morgue .

The limited-edition Porsche was previously owned by IndyCar driver Graham Rahal, who has said it could be difficult to drive. Walker, . the star of five of the six 'Fast & Furious' movies, was the face . of the franchise and he was making the seventh film in the series when . he died. Not destroyed: Though the car exploded in flames, its three data recorders survived and may produce information to pinpoint the speed . Heartbreaking: Friends were unable to save Walker. The car is pictured still burning as firefighters arrive . Wreck: Witnesses walk away from the tragic scene. Walker was killed by his injuries and by the fire . Universal Pictures has shut down production while it contemplates how it might go forward without him. On Sunday, fans gathered near to the crash site for a massive memorial, which had been planned through social media, for the actor. Thousands came to pay their respects, placing flowers, candles and other tributes at the scene. Many arrived in cars built for speed, and the sounds of engines revving echoed close to where Walker and his friend died in the crash. The memorial also coincided with news that the actor had planned to give up his life as a Hollywood actor to spend more time with his 15-year-old daughter, Meadow. Meadow had recently moved from her home in Hawaii to live with Walker in Santa Barbara. In an interview earlier this year, Walker described his daughter as 'the best partner I've ever had'. Loss: Walker, left, perished alongside his friend and financial adviser, Roger Rodas, right, who was driving . Loved: Fans gathered for an unofficial memorial event at the crash scene in Santa Clarita on Sunday . Memories: Loud cars were driven past a crowd attending the memorial on Sunday for Paul Walker . 'I've never had anything like this in my life,' he said. 'I've been so transient; I've been on my own since I was 16. There's a part of me who feels like I'm making up for lost time.' According to two of Walker's closest friends, Walker believed he had accomplished all that he wanted from Hollywood and now believed he needed to devote himself to his daughter. 'He was a family man and I know it hurt him to be spending so much time away from Meadow on location; he loved being with his daughter, she was his world,' Ronn Shikari told The Mail Online. 'That’s why he wanted to retire from acting and talked to his family about it, as he’d achieved everything he wanted to achieve. ‘He earned millions from the last Fast and Furious. The big reason he wanted to quit acting was so that he could spend more time with Meadow. It’s a shame that it could never happen.’","Actor pictured leaving charity fundraiser in Santa Clarita on November 30 - just moments before his friend's car hit a pole and burst into flames .

"A tiny fly from Asia could wipe out British strawberries and other soft fruit, scientists have warned. At just 2mm long, Drosophila suzukii uses powerful saw like jaws to break through the skins of ripe fruit and deposit its young inside. The maggots then hatch, and eat through strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and other soft fruit, causing it to rot. Scientists are trying to establish how widespread it is in Britain amidst fears it could devastate the local market and drive prices skyhigh. Britain's fruit industry is on red alert after the pest was spotted in Kent last year. It has proved impossible to eradicate elsewhere in the world . The new pest has already spread rapidly through the USA and Italy since 2008, and was first spotted in the UK last year. The state of California alone lost $300 million worth of strawberry crops the year the insect was detected. Dr Ezio Rosato, of the University of Leicester, said: 'Drosophila suzukii are different from the common fruit flies found in the UK. They are able to use their enormous ovipositor to break into fresh fruit and lay their eggs. 'This creates trouble. If you are a fruit grower and have little maggots growing in your fruit, it won’t be marketable. The animal has already had a huge effect on the soft fruit market in the USA and Italy. 'We want to limit the impact the animal will have in the UK. We want to develop a genetic system to control the spread of the animal - rather than relying on pesticides or introducing new predators.' Slightly larger than common fruit flies which only lay eggs in rotten fruit, the males are easy to spot thanks to the dark dots on each wing. Also known as the spotted wing Drosophila, it originated in south east Asia. The tiny Asian fruit fly - the spotted wing vinegar fly known as drosophila suzukii - devastates soft fruit crops . Dr Rosato and colleagues are appealing to the public to help map out its invasion after some areas in the USA experienced 80 per cent loss of crop yields. They are hoping to find a biological solution to prevent the same happening in the UK. The fly, known as drosophila suzukii, . originated in south-east Asia but reached the US in 2008, Italy in 2009 . and Canada, Russia, France and Spain in 2010. Adult flies are brownish-yellow with black bands on the abdomen, up to 3mm long with bright red eyes. Females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year. The plan is to genetically modify male fruit flies in order to ‘switch off’ genes essential for the development of the embryo into a maggot. The switch does not involve toxic substances or foreign genes. Instead, it exploits a natural process of gene regulation. When the modified flies are released into the wild and mate with females offspring will not develop into larvae, preventing the species from reproducing further. The approach removes the need to use pesticides or introduce new predators to kill the insects, both of which can have unintended consequences for other species and the environment. They are asking for the help of budding ‘citizen scientists’ to set traps for the flies around the country, so the scientists can see where the flies have already made themselves at home. Anyone can take a recycled plastic . bottle, cut small holes in the sides and put a small amount of cider . vinegar in before hanging it from a tree or the fence in their garden. Fruit flies and other insects in the area will be attracted by the vinegar, and will enter by the small holes but will drown in the liquid at the bottom. People can then send the liquid back to the scientists who can check to see if any Drosophila suzukii made their way into the bottle. This will help build up a map of where the insects are appearing around the country. More than 50 people have already signed up to take part with traps set in Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire. Dr Rosato added: 'Having the public involved in this project is really useful as it will help us have an idea of where the animal already is in the country. It is also a really good way of involving people in science, and I think people really appreciate having the chance to take part.'","A 2mm Asian fly could devastate the UK fruit industry, experts have warned .

"Thousands of high school students across suburban Denver ditched class and took to the streets Thursday in the fourth day of protests against a new history curriculum. Some of them even stripped their clothes off in a show of solidarity against a new set of Advanced Placement history standards proposed by a conservative-led school board. Most of the young protesters gathered at streetsides near their respective schools as many waved signs bearing patriotic slogans and American flags. Scroll down for video . Censor this! Protesters at Bear Creek High School hold a sign while standing on a street near the school in Lakewood, Colorado Thursday. High school students in Colorado's second-largest school district staged a walkout again on Thursday to demonstrate against proposed changes to a history curriculum that would stress patriotism and discourage civil disobedience . Interesting response: The proposal in the state's second-largest school district comes in response to a new national framework for teaching Advanced Placement history . Stripping: A protesting Pamona High School student wears a sign on his body as he waves to passing motorists in a busy intersection near his school, during a multi-school protest against a Jefferson County School Board proposal to emphasize patriotism and downplay civil unrest in the teaching of U.S. history in Arvada, Colorado . A Wednesday afternoon demonstration against the plan to focus class material on topics that promote patriotism and respect for authority while discouraging civil disorder lasted about three hours, authorities said. Later, about 75 students from another area school walked out after meeting with Jefferson County school Superintendent Dan McMinimee about the proposal. McMinimee has offered to meet with any students about the standards proposed by Julie Williams, one of three members of the school board's recently elected conservative majority. The proposal in the state's second-largest school district comes in response to a new national framework for teaching Advanced Placement history. Supporters say the new outline from the College Board, which oversees the program, would focus on critical thinking and classroom discussion rather than memorization. Critics fear it would place too much emphasis on the nation's problems. For its part, the College Board says the new system provides a balanced view. The Jefferson County school board plan would establish a committee to review texts and coursework, starting with Advanced Placement history, to make sure materials 'promote citizenship, patriotism, essentials and benefits of the free-market system, respect for authority and respect for individual rights' and don't 'encourage or condone civil disorder, social strife or disregard of the law.'

"One of Spain's most wanted men whose Basque terrorist cell was behind a murderous bomb attack that left 12 police officers dead and 60 people injured appeared in a British court today. ETA member Antonio Troitino, 55, has been convicted of 22 murders and was originally jailed for 2,232 years for the terror attack - but because of legal restriction released after just 24 years. His release caused outrage and just days later his licence was revoked and he was recalled to prison - but he had already fled. Antonio Troitino Arranz, left, has been convicted of 22 murders, and Ignacio Lerin Sanchez, right, is . considered one of ETA’s most dangerous terrorists. The pair appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court . After more than a year on the run he . was arrested in a dawn raid in Hounslow, west London, last month where . he was living with another fugitive ETA terrorist who appeared alongside . him in the dock today. Wearing . a grey and blue polo neck jumper shaven headed Troitino listened . intently as the facts of his terrorist attack were outlined. He . is refusing to be sent home to serve the remaining 2,096 days of his . sentence on a number of grounds including that it breaches his human . right to liberty. Troitino, from the Palencia province of northern Spain, was one of ETA's most prolific killers in the 1980s. Melanie Cumberland, prosecuting, told Westminster Magistrates' Court the arrest warrant was issued in April 2011 and certified by SOCA on June 29 this year. She said: 'This defendant is a convicted person, his extradition is sought for the purpose of serving the remainder of the sentence of imprisonment of 2,096 days, that's five years, nine months and five days. 'The basis of the conviction is for 91 offences was that on the days leading up to July 14 1986 this defendant and others, all members of the terrorist organisation ETA, planned, prepared and detonated an explosive device which was planted in a van in Madrid.' Terror: Masked members of ETA raise their fists as they declare a permanent cease-fire in January. The separatist cell has killed more than 800 people since it launched its campaign for an independent Basque state in the late 1960s . The van was packed with five pressure cookers, metal shrapnel, 35kg of plastic explosives and a remote control trigger device and parked at the side of a busy road. Ms Cumberland said: 'This defendant activated a remote explosive device when a bus full of members of the Civil Guard was coming past. 'As a consequence 12 members of the Civil Guard died, 43 were injured and 17 civilians were injured.' He was arrested in 1987 and jailed for 2,232 years at the National Court in 1989 for terrorist murder, attempted terrorist murder, and offences of terrorist havoc. Destruction: In July 1986 Troitino detonated a car bomb by remote control in the Plaza de la Republica Dominicana in Madrid. The blast destroyed a Civil Guard van, killing 12 officers and wounding 51 people . But Spanish law meant that the maximum he could serve in jail was 30 years and his sentence was commuted. At the time the term was reduced the law also meant he was entitled to be released on remission and they let him walk free after 24 years. But they recalled him a week later after a 2006 Supreme Court ruling known as the 'Parrot doctrine' meant he could now served longer behind bars. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Troitino, from the Palencia province of northern Spain, was one of ETA's most prolific killers in the 1980s . Troitino has refused to be extradited claiming he had not breach his licence and that the process was a breach of article 5 of the human rights act - his right to liberty. His legal team argued that the Spanish court cannot cannot change the rules retroactively and force him to serve longer behind bars than was originally legal. Mark Summers, defending, said that he left Spain legally on proper travel documents, adding: 'He has not fled Spain, he is not a fugitive from justice, he has spent over 24 years in custody and as a result he is a fragile man.' District Judge Daphne Wickham refused the application on the grounds 'alarm bells' were set ringing by the fact that when he was arrested by armed cops he was living with illegal immigrants in a house with £8,000 in cash and false ID documents. He is being held in high security prison Belmarsh and his extradition is due to be heard in September. Another of Spain's most wanted men, Inaki Lerin Sanchez, 39, appeared alongside him in the dock today as the court did not have enough staff to separate them. The pair had been living together but their cases are not linked. Both are refusing to be returned to their homeland. Sanchez is wanted after Spanish police raided the home he shared with his brother. It was searched in March 2007 and a 'bomb making factory' was found, prosecutor Ben Watson said. Inside they found 150kg of explosives, bolts and ball bearings, detonators and ETA propaganda. But when they tried to arrest Sanchez he had already fled. His extradition hearing will be heard later this year.","ETA member Antonio Troitino, 55, was convicted of 22 murders .

"Side-by-side with a Government minister in the House of Lords, this is the millionaire hotelier accused of making huge profits turning a suburban London street into a refugee camp. Indian businessman Gauhar Nawab, 73, has reportedly negotiated a deal to be paid £500,000 of taxpayers’ money to cram nearly 800 asylum seekers into his 98-room hotel. As a result of the block booking, prices for other guests at the three-star Euro Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace have been pushed up by more than 500 per cent. High society: Baroness Verma with Gauhar Nawab at an awards ceremony in October 2013 . There were serious questions over the deal on Friday as it emerged he has twice in the past three years been photographed being entertained in the House of Lords by a junior minister. Mr Nawab, who lives with his wife in a £2million mansion, is seen posing at Indian community events with Baroness Verma, Conservative Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. In October 2012, Baroness Verma hosted an award ceremony for the Non-Resident Indians Welfare Society Of India, of which Mr Nawab is international president. At a similar event the following year, guests including Mr Nawab were offered personal tours of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. He is also the patron of the India International Foundation – which supports Indian culture in the UK – alongside Labour MP Keith Vaz. On Friday, the Mail told how the Euro Queens Hotel is being used as a makeshift camp for refugees who have made their way to Britain from countries including Eritrea, Sudan, Syria and Pakistan. A council inspection has found the 98-room hotel has an astonishing 791 asylum seekers in residence. They are crammed up to nine to a room while they wait to be processed by the Home Office. It emerged on Friday that the hotel is owned by Mr Nawab, a businessman and socialite who owns the Euro Hotels Group – which is worth around £6.7million. He and his wife Athar, 69, have been accused of making huge profits from the refugee crisis – apparently negotiating a four-month deal with a Home Office provider earning them an estimated £500,000. Prices for regular customers at the hotel have also shot up, with a double room advertised yesterday for £333, compared to the usual price of £49. Crammed: Asylum seekers gather outside the three-star Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace, London . Mr Nawab and his wife live in a huge seven-bedroom detached house in Tooting – three miles from the Euro Queens Hotel – where they have two male housekeepers. This week, there were two cars outside, including a Daimler Super V8 Jaguar with a personalised number plate. But there has been fierce opposition from residents as Mr Nawab has attempted to expand his business empire. Local MP Steve Reed, who has taken up the case with the immigration minister, said: ‘I am furious. The hotel is on the edge of our shopping centre in a highly residential area. ‘It seems highly inappropriate to place so many asylum seekers in an area like this without proper consultation, planning or preparation.’ A resident yesterday added: ‘I feel for the refugees... but having hundreds in a small hotel and spilling out on to our street... is not acceptable. ‘The owners want to keep expanding to do this more. They are making millions and our front gardens have turned into a refugee camp.’ The asylum seekers were placed in the hotel by private contractors Clearel under a Home Office scheme. A spokesman for Clearel declined to comment. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure... We have instructed our providers to cut substantially the number staying at the Queens Hotel, and to cease further bookings there by the end of the week.’ A spokesman for Baroness Verma denied links to Mr Nawab, adding: ‘There are no business links between them at all. A lot of businessmen come to the House of Lords.’ The Nawabs declined to comment yesterday.","Gauhar Nawab, 73, runs the three-star Euro Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace .

"A nephew of convicted polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs has told a Texas jury that his uncle sexually abused him as a young boy. Brent Jeffs testified on Saturday during the sentencing phase of the 55-year-old Warren Jeffs' trial. A jury convicted Warren Jeffs on Thursday of sexually assaulting two underage girls and could sentence him to life in prison. Convicted: Law enforcement officials escort Warren Jeffs (C) out of the Tom Green County Courthouse in ankle and wrist shackles on Friday in San Angelo, Texas . Outrage: Jeffs, a polygamist sect leader convicted of child sexual assault walked out of his sentencing hearing in protest on Friday, after reading a statement he claimed was from God . Brent Jeffs testified that his uncle sodomized him when he was five-years-old. 'This . is between me, you and God,' he said Jeffs told him. Three jurors wiped . tears from their eyes during his emotional testimony. Warren Jeffs was never charged with . sexually assaulting his nephew, but Brent Jeffs says he and his uncle . reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed in 2003. Texas Ranger Jesse Valdez and Ezra Draper, who left the FLDS in 2003, also testified on Saturday. Valdez identified a number of documents seized during the 2008 raid on a ranch Jeff's church operates near Eldorado, Texas. Draper, . who attended Alta Academy between 1978 and 1987, when Jeffs was . principal, described being summoned to the office of the self-proclaimed . profit once and receiving a lecture for exchanging notes with a female . student. Sickening: Jeffs is seen embracing one of his child brides as he smiles at the camera . Shocking: The pictures of Jeffs and one of his child brides compounded damning evidence brought by prosecutors . Draper described how Jeffs used a yardstick, to stroke the inside of his thighs, and tapped his crotch three times. 'Better that one of your members be cut off than the whole body be cast into hell,' Draper testified Jeffs told him. He went on to describe changes that . Jeffs made to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day . Saints, including banning parades, dances, music and the colour red, . reports CNN. Jeffs represented himself during the eight-day trial, but he walked out of his sentencing in protest on Friday, telling the court there would be a 'whirlwind of judgement' on the world if God's 'humble servant' wasn't set free. He has been held in another room in the courthouse. The news comes as shocking . pictures emerged showing Jeffs holding and passionately kissing an . underage female church member. Abuser: These are just some of the shocking images that show convicted child sex cult leader Warren Jeffs with one of his child 'wives' Shocking: A law enforcement officer, right, escorts Rebecca Musser, left, a former member of the church and a witness for the prosecution . And . as the Texas court began today to consider punishment for Jeffs today, . prosecutors told the jury to expect more sickening revelations, . including the fact he had 24 underage 'wives'. Other pictures revealed to the court today showed beds where ritual sex sessions were carried out in front of a church audience. State witness Rebecca Musser - a . former FLDS member - told the court she had received training about how . beds in the temple were to be used in sexual rituals before it was . built. Miss Musser told the court beds . inside the temple were arranged so that witnesses could see the abuse . and that a special seat was placed for someone to record the sexual . acts. Also called to . testify was Utah psychologist Larry Beall who described Jeffs' grooming . of the underage girls as being 'like a peadophile'. Mr . Beall, who has worked with FLDS victims, said some of the abused girls . may not even recognise they have been sexually assaulted - such was . their 'mental conditioning' Worship: Temple of the Fundamentalist Church . of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in El Dorado, Texas, where the . 'heavenly sessions' with the young girls took place . 'He [Jeffs] was an expert at taking average sounding words and making them sexual.' Mr Beall then gave examples where Jeffs used phrases such as 'being ready' and 'heavenly sessions' to refer to sex. At . the start of today's punishment phase, and before jurors had even been . brought back into court, Jeffs absented himself from events saying: 'I . request the full removal of myself as an objection to all that has been . presented.' He asked to . keep serving as his own attorney, but state District Judge Barbara . Walther said he couldn't leave and continue to represent himself at the . same time. Irons: Jeffs, center, arrives in wrist and leg shackles to the Tom Green County Courthouse for the sentencing phase of his sexual assault trial today . Instead, she ordered two lawyers who had been Jeffs' standby counsel, Deric Walpole and Emily Munoz Detoto, to represent him. 'Mr Jeffs, I know this is difficult for you to understand, but you do not have control over these proceedings,' Walther said. Jeffs often stands in court and waits up to a full minute before speaking. He began in slow and deliberate manner to respond, saying 'I am . . .,' but Walther ordered a recess. Jeffs . is the ecclesiastical head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ . of Latter Day Saints, which believes polygamy brings exaltation in . heaven. The more than 10,000 FLDS members nationwide see Jeffs as a . prophet who is God's spokesman on Earth. Jeffs asked to be taken back to jail, but Walther said that would make it too difficult for his lawyers to communicate with him. Instead, he was placed in a room near the court and will be allowed to return to the hearing whenever he chooses. The judge said Jeffs won't be able to dismiss his attorneys again and go back to defending himself, however. He . burned through a slate of seven high-powered attorneys, including . Walpole and Detoto, in the six months before he decided to represent . himself, and Walther said he did so in an effort to manipulate the court . and stall the case against him. Prosecutors plan to call witnesses . during the sentencing hearing and introduce evidence showing Jeffs . committed a slew of crimes not mentioned during his trial. For . starters, Jeffs had 78 wives along with his legal spouse, and 24 of . them were under age 17, said Eric Nichols, lead prosecutor for the Texas . Attorney General's office, which is handling the case. Nichols . also said he would show that Jeffs committed six other sexual assaults . and either witnessed or performed more than 500 polygamist marriages, as . well as 67 other sect marriages involving underage girls. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott,  left, and . Rebecca Musser, a former member of Jeffs' church. At 19 she was . married to Jeffs' father Rulon, 83, the then-prophet, who died in . 2002. She left the church shortly after his death when Warren tried to . force her to remarry . Jeffs . spent years evading arrest - criss-crossing the country as a fugitive . who eventually made the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list before his capture in . 2006, Nichols said, and he excommunicated 60 church members he saw as a . threat to his leadership, breaking up 300 families while stripping them . of property and 'reassigning' wives and children. All . of that is separate from the assaults on two girls, ages 12 and 15, . that Jeffs was convicted of Thursday, after jurors deliberated for three . and a half hours. Prosecutors . used DNA evidence to show Jeffs fathered a child with the older victim . and played an audio recording of what they said was him sexually . assaulting the younger one. They . played other tapes in which Jeffs was heard instructing as many as a . dozen of his young wives on how to please him sexually — and thus, he . told them, please God. After . Jeffs left the courtroom Friday, Nichols gave an opening statement, . saying Jeffs was guilty of 'a breathtaking quantity of criminal . activity' as head of the FLDS. 'The . defendant abused not only his position, but those religious views . you've heard about as a means of satisfying his own personal greed, . desires and appetites,' Nichols said. Walpole . responded by saying Jeffs was raised in the church and couldn't betray . his own religious tenets. Jeffs took over leadership of the FLDS from . his father. 'He would rather go to prison than disagree with those beliefs,' Walpole said. 'He'd rather make a complete mess of this case.' He later told jurors, 'you've shown you can be tough. Now it's time to show you can be fair.'","Jeffs' nephew tells jurors he was abused by his uncle at age five .

"He's handy with a shot glass and customers travel from far and wide to admire him at work. The only strange thing about Carl the bartender is that he's not quite human.

Guests at the bar can interact with Carl, who was developed and built by mechatronics engineer Ben Schaefer . With a glass in hand. humanoid robot bartender Carl is ready to serve customers at the Robots Bar and Lounge in Ilmenau, eastern Germany . Carl can mix drinks according to customers' requests and also indulge in small talk, his creator says . Carl helps out another bartender by pouring a shot of a spirit into their cocktail shaker ready to be mixed . The robot is the creation of mechatronics engineer Ben Schaefer, who has spent 23 years working in the field. He built Carl from the parts of disused industrial robots from the German firm KUKA. His newest employee helps out his human colleagues by pouring out measures of spirits and adding them to cocktail shakers for mixing. He can also conduct short conversations with the customers who take up the bar's nine seats, though they probably don't sparkle like the drinks because his speech recognition skills and ability to interact are, for the moment, limited. To make sure the robot does not crash in the small area behind the bar, Carl wears a belt with sensors. Carl's creator Ben Schaefer, a mechatronics engineer, has been working in the field of humanoid robots for 23 years . Mr Schaefer interacts with his newest employee as it offers up a glass of spirits to be adding to Mr Schaefer's own cup . There are only nine seats at the bar for the best view of Carl in action at the Robots Lounge and Bar in Ilmenau . The customers can have limited conversations with Carl who also measures out spirits for another bartender to mix . The belt helps Carl stay upright instead of spilling drinks everywhere and protects his human counterparts. Another room in the bar, described as a place to encounter technology and future visions, contains a life-size model of a Nasa astronaut. Writing on the bar's website, Mr Schaefer said his company aims to make humanity in humanoid robots closer to reality and show that 'scenes as in science fiction films are quite possible'. Humanoid robots tend to have limbs and a torso to resemble the human body, while artificial intelligence tries to replicate the way the mind works. Mr Schaefer said putting Carl to work meant it was easier to see how the design needed improving than trying to figure out problems in a laboratory . Perhaps one day Carl may boast the skills of Tom Cruise in Cocktail, but for now his creator is making him useful by having him measure out spirits . By putting Carl in a real-life scenario, it was easier to test the programming and make improvements than it would be in a laboratory. 'On this system, you can let your imagination run wild, because each step makes our robot a bit more human,' Mr Shaefer writes. For now, Carl will be part-tourist attraction and part test-dummy while Mr Schaefer and his team work out how to shake humanoid robotics out of its 'stagnant' state.","The humanoid robot measures out spirits at the Robots Bar and Lounge .

"The glamour model ex-girlfriend of Colonel Gaddafi's playboy son has told of the terrifying moment she was captured by rebels who threatened to 'burn her alive'. Talitha van Zon had been with Mutassim Gaddafi just over a week ago as he calmly drank Jack Daniels whisky and coke as he toasted a victory over the rebels. But the next day the rebels backed by Nato airstrikes launched a surprise attack on Tripoli and Mutassim joined fighters. Talitha was ambushed as she tried to leave the country was forced to turn back and take refuge at a hotel. Dutch model: Talith van Zon partied with Mutassim Gaddafi then was captured by rebels after they attacked Tripoli last weekend . But the Dutch model was then paraded in front of rebel fighters who chanted 'petrol'. She feared they would 'burn her alive' and then made a desperate escape by leaping from the hotel's balcony. 'I was shocked when I met Mutassim. He had changed,' Talitha told the Sunday Telegraph this week from the hospital where she was being treated for her injuries. 'It was the first time I had seen him since just before the February uprising. He had a beard, he was sitting on a couch strewn with automatic weapons, and he was guarded by unsmiling 16-year-old boys with sub-machine guns.' Luxury: Talitha had a three month relationship with Gaddafi's son after they met in 2004 . Talitha said that on her latest visit to Libya, Mutassim's eyes were 'cold'. She said he looked capable of 'killing someone '. The image of Mutassim sitting beneath a portrait of his father and plotting the war against rebels was a far cry from the fun-loving playboy she had been in a relationship with in 2004. Their romance had only lasted three months, as Talitha claims that there were 'other women' in Mutassim's life, but the pair remained close friends. The former Playboy centrefold was drawn into the world of luxury that the Gaddafi clan enjoyed and showered with gifts. She recalls how she was flown around the world. In Monaco Talitha said she was taken to the Grand Prix and a dinner party attended by Princess Caroline. While at Christmas she enjoyed holidays on the Caribbean island of Saint Barts after being flown their on a private Boeing. According to Talitha, when Mutassim was in Paris or London he would book several floors of the most expensive hotels and fill them with friends and Italian hairdressers would be flown in from from around the world. 'I asked him once how much he spent, and he took a minute to add it up in his head. He said ''about $2 million''. I said ''you mean a year?'' He said ''no – a month''.' The gifts that the Arab leader's son showered Talitha with included a collection of Louis Vuitton bags and an expensive watch. But throughout their relationship, Talitha said that she remained in a 'gilded cage' and had little idea about the lives of Libyans who seemed 'happy enough'.ordinary . Talitha was never allowed to meet Gaddafi himself and never questioned having an intimate friendship with the son of a tyrant. She visited Tripoli and stayed in Mutassim's beach houses, his country estates and villas, which were furnished with gaudy gold fittings and lavish chandeliers. Conflict: Libyan rebels celebrate after defeating loyalist troops in Al-Jamil, western Libya yesterday. Talitha said she feared they would burn her alive when they caught her . Talitha said that Mutassim denied that the Libyan people were suppressed. They had free hospital care and schools, and cheap bread and rice, he is said to have told her. But beneath the playboy's fun-loving exterior was a sinsiter side she witnessed when he launched a scathing attack on a servant who delivered a cold mean and the forced him to sit in the corner and eat it all. She said that Mutassim idolised leaders such as Adolf Hitler, Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro and longed for that kind of success. Instead, he spent his life in the shadow of his older brother, Saif, who many considered to be Gaddafi's heir. Mutassim is believed to have once tried to overthrow his father but was exiled when he failed. He was given a role as a national security advisor but has been described by officials as 'not intellectually curious'. Talitha said that he confirmed to her Libya's role in Lockerbie bombers which appear to have been done for revenge. She said: 'I told him the victims were civilians, not military, and he said ''Talitha, the Americans attacked our house in Libya and my father lost one child (a reference to the US bombing of Tripoli in 1986).'' He was quite open about the Libyans doing it for revenge.' Talitha's last meeting with Mutassim was on the Friday before rebels attacked Tripoli. He left her to fight for his father and she left the country on a humanitarian ship to Malta on Friday.","Talitha van Zon partied with Mutassim Gaddafi night before rebels attacked Tripoli .

"A clever child from a loving middle class home, William Cornick was the most unlikely perpetrator of a crime that would shock Britain. As the 16-year-old was sentenced to life in prison after becoming the first pupil to kill a teacher in a British classroom, friends said they were stunned by his senseless stabbing of his teacher Ann Maguire. To the teacher in charge of his year he was ‘a delightful pupil who always gave his best’. Fellow pupils at Corpus Christi Catholic College said he was a just a ‘typical lad’ who rarely misbehaved. Scroll down for video . Killer: William Cornick was 15 years old when he stabbed his teacher Ann Maguire, 61, to death, as she taught a class at Corpus Christi Catholic College, in Leeds, in April . ‘He was probably the most intelligent person I knew,’ said Tom Smith, a former student. ‘But he was really quiet and kept himself to himself. He had his friends, but he wasn’t with them all the time. ‘You can look at someone and say “I don’t think they could do anything like that”. I’m still shocked. I didn’t think that in a school like Corpus such a thing could happen.’ Another unnamed student said: ‘He was like any other lad my age; he wasn’t a naughty kid. He was a typical, nice lad. It seems surreal how it’s changed.’ Cornick was no youth from a sink estate left to his own devices by a dysfunctional family. His mother Michelle, 48, is a human resources manager, who was said to be devoted to the teenager and his 19-year-old brother Zack, who is in a rock band. Stable life: Far from being having an unhappy upbringing, Cornick, depicted in a court sketch, comes from a middleclass background and his parents have been described as loving and supportive . Their father Ian is a 50-year-old council executive who lives with his partner and their young child in an upmarket village near Leeds. Although his parents divorced a decade ago, Cornick seemed to enjoy a happy home life. The life sentence handed down to the schoolboy who murdered a teacher was today condemned as too harsh by youth justice campaigners. Former magistrate Penelope Gibbs, who chairs the Standing Committee for Youth Justice umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said the sentence was too long. She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘We are out of line with the whole of western Europe. There are no other countries within Western Europe which give children - and this boy is seen as a child under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is in the youth justice system - who would give children a life sentence.’ Ms Gibbs accepted that the sentence had to serve as a punishment, but said there was ‘no evidence’ for the 20-year minimum tariff. ‘Punishment is also incredibly important, particularly for the victims and families, but the fact is, how many years do we need for punishment? We have given him a sentence which is more than his own lifetime,’ she said. ‘He was 15 when he did this crime and we would say that you don't need that long to punish. What is crucial is that when he is released he is assessed as no longer being of danger to himself and others and thus we would all be safer. 'But there is no evidence that that takes 20 years and we've looked and we think that this is the longest sentence given to a child in at least 10 years. I'm not going to tell you exactly what the right sentence would have been, but 20 years and a life sentence is too long.’ Paul Greaney, prosecuting, said there was nothing to indicate to the boy’s parents or teachers that he was capable of homicidal violence. He added that Mr and Mrs Cornick are ‘decent and responsible parents’ who have co- operated fully with the police. Mr Justice Coulson said Mr and Mrs Cornick were ‘responsible and caring parents and his family life was marked by love and support’. Cornick had never been in any trouble with the police and was one of the brightest students at Corpus Christi, passing five GCSE exams a year early. He was regarded as ‘amicable, enthusiastic and conscientious’ at school, with a 100 per cent attendance record. In the four years before the killing, five incidents of misbehaviour were recorded – two minor. Significantly, the final three took place two months before the murder and concerned his hatred of Mrs Maguire and dislike of Spanish lessons. But closer inspection of Cornick’s internet use revealed a different side to his apparently respectable image. As one pupil said: ‘The Grim Reaper was the first thing you saw on his [Facebook] page. ‘That corrected everyone’s opinion. [I thought] what the hell has happened, something has definitely gone wrong.’ Friends had begun to regard him as a ‘loner and weirdo’ and ‘disturbing’ aspects of his personality became apparent. He spoke openly about murdering his teacher, messaging a friend on Facebook about brutally killing her and spending the rest of his life in jail. He had numerous images of knives on his mobile phone. He also had a keen interest in ultra-violent video games, including Dark Souls II, in which players hack zombies to pieces. Players devour the souls of their fallen enemies to the sound of cries of agony. Disturbing images include a character made up of hundreds of human corpses. It was voted one of the ten Most Violent Video Games of 2014. One pupil recalled Cornick saying disgusting things at a party. He said: ‘He was saying twisted stuff like “imagine jumping on a pregnant woman and seeing the baby come out”, and saying horrible stuff about cancer and stuff like that. Loss: Ann Maguire's family, husband Don  and daughters Emma  and Kerry, stand outside Leeds Crown Court as a statement is read after the sentencing . ‘He was just saying it in conversation. He thought it was normal but it’s not. He wasn’t normal in the head.’ But for a long time Cornick had been able to hide his ‘anger’ from others by maintaining an appearance of normality. From game to real life: Will Cornick's Facebook photograph shows him wearing a gamer tshirt . The teenager later confessed to a psychiatrist that the killing had been on his mind for three years, and one expert said he had engaged in a ‘considerable amount of fantasy’ about killing Mrs Maguire. Psychiatrists decided he suffered from a personality disorder with psychopathic tendencies. It was of course too late, but the danger this previously anonymous teenager poses has now been revealed to all. John Kent, a forensic psychiatrist, said Cornick ‘presents a risk of serious harm to the public and that this risk is present for the foreseeable future’. Mr Greaney told Leeds Crown Court: ‘One of the most disturbing aspects of an extremely disturbing case is that [Cornick] not only lacks remorse but is proud of what he did in killing Mrs Maguire.’ The QC said Cornick told a psychiatrist: ‘I wasn’t in shock, I was happy. I had a sense of pride. I still do.’ He added that Cornick’s parents were ‘at a loss’ to understand how their son could have committed such a crime. Absolved of any blame by both police and the judge, Mr and Mrs Cornick sat behind their son in the court room dock as details of his chilling lack of remorse were revealed. Gudrun Wroot, who worked with Mrs Cornick at a catalogue publisher, said: ‘It is awful for the family of the woman who has been killed but it is also traumatic for the family of the boy. Mothers blame themselves but she can’t … It is just terrible. But really she is a nice person and a very caring mother.’","William Cornick sentenced to life in prison for murder of his teacher .

London is the most desirable place to work in the world, beating New York and Paris, according to a new poll . For those Brits that would work overseas, the preferred countries were the U.S., Canada, Germany, Australia and France. Meanwhile, the UK was the top destination for people from Portugal, Israel, Barbados, Romania and Jamaica. Escaping political instability or poverty at home was the driving force for people wanting to migrate, while those in developed countries were more likely to migrate to gain more work experience. Globally, jobseekers said being recognised for their work was their number one priority, while Brits sought 'good relationships with colleagues' and a 'good work-life balance' as the most important factors.

"A man suspected of taking a drugs overdose was arrested after he violently attacked two paramedics - before speeding off in their AMBULANCE. The ambulance crew treating the 37-year-old patient were forced to call police yesterday after he became so violent they were unable to control him. The man assaulted the two male paramedics just before 3pm on the High Street in Bloxwich, West Midlands, after being helped from a flat to the ambulance. The damaged ambulance. A police car was also . damaged trying to stop the fleeing man and the police officer driving . needed to be taken to hospital . But before the police could arrive the man forced the paramedics out of their ambulance, jumped behind the wheel and sped off with the vehicle's back doors still open. He then drove erratically down the busy road for nearly two miles, making at least two U-turns, before crashing into a police car outside the village's Baptist Church. After being forced to stop by the collision the man was then arrested. West Midlands Police confirmed the man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault and vehicle theft. He was then held at a nearby police station. Inspector Tony Banton, from Bloxwich Police Station, said: 'The ambulance was driven off with its rear doors still open. A West Midlands Ambulance like that pictured was stolen after a man attacked two paramedics . 'It was reported being driven very erratically and we're looking into whether it may have struck other vehicles. 'A response vehicle quickly picked up the ambulance and the man was arrested within five minutes of the emergency call coming in to us. 'There was a low-level collision between the ambulance and the arresting officer's car. That officer has been taken to hospital suffering whiplash-like injuries. 'Two male members of ambulance staff were also taken to hospital as a precaution but are not seriously injured.'

A spokesperson for the West Midlands Ambulance Service, said: 'Two ambulance crew members were attacked by a man they'd been called to help, and who they believed needed hospital treatment. For them to be attacked is disgraceful. 'Thankfully they've not been seriously hurt but no doubt this was a shocking, unexpected incident, and one of our vehicles has been badly damaged and will have to be taken off the road for some time to be repaired.

"His legacy lives on: The remainder of Paul Walker's Fast & Furious 7 scenes will be filmed by brothers Cody and Caleb, it has been confirmed . Paul Walker's remains were cremated Thursday ahead of a small family-only ceremony on Saturday. According to RadarOnline, the Fast & The Furious star was transferred from the mortuary at Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in Glendale, California. A source told the website the family 'intends on dividing Paul's ashes between an urn and keepsakes.' The funeral will be held on the weekend and only family are invited, though it has been reported some of Walker's Fast & Furious co-stars will attend. The news comes a day after the beloved actor's family toured the Hollywood cemetery, looking for the perfect place to lay their loved one to rest. Walker was killed last month when the Porsche he was traveling in crashed and burned in Santa Clarita. On Wednesday, Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr., brother, Cody Walker, 25, and other family members finalized plans for the actor's funeral service. They also walked around the grounds of the cemetery, choosing a grave site plot.

The . experts told the family that the car could have lost traction after . hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and . skidded off the road. The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash. bott's Dots: Paul Walker's family have claimed that experts have said that road markers called Bott's Dots (circled) may have been the cause of the crash that killed him . Total devastation: There was little left of the wreckage after impact, with investigators ruling that speed and not a mechanical fault was to blame for the tragedy . The Porsche was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Rodas. It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fiber frame and 5.7 liter race-derived V10 engine. It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models. Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity . when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ, a memo . circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot . drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.' 'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.) 'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar. His final moments: The heartthrob is pictured in the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT just moments before it careered off the road and hit a tree and a pole, killing him and driver Roger Rodas in a fiery explosion . Police have revealed that a second man . has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche . that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed. Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges. Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site. The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offense. Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram. The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed. The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police. The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft. A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof. Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intentions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many. The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.","The Fast & The Furious star was transferred from the mortuary at Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in Glendale, California, for the cremation Thursday .

"Britain's elite troops operating in Iraq are carrying gas protection suits because Islamic State fighters are feared to have taken control of Syrian chemical weapons. Special Forces units have carried out reconnaissance in the region to provide up-to-date information on the jihadists for RAF airstrikes, and are also training Kurdish fighters battling the regime. But despite international efforts to destroy President Assad's chemical weapon stockpile, it is thought that some may have fallen into the hands of ISIS after the militants seized vast swathes of Iraq and Syria - and they could be used on troops in retaliation for the UK joining the U.S.-led air campaign.

Power said the U.S. is concerned not only that President Bashar Assad's regime still has chemical weapons but that any stockpiles left behind could end up in the hands of the terrorists. Activists today said the U.S.-led coalition has struck targets of the Islamic State group near a besieged Kurdish town along Syria's border with Turkey. It was not immediately clear if Tuesday's airstrikes succeeded in halting the militants' advance on Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit Islamic State fighters east and west of the town. The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, also confirmed the airstrikes on the town's outskirts. Koubani has been under attack by the Islamic State group since mid-September. Despite the airstrikes, the militants were able to advance toward the town over the past few days. The Observatory says fighting around Koubani on Monday killed 57 fighters on both sides - the town's Kurdish defenders and the Islamic militants.","There are fears IS militants have secured chemical weapon stockpiles .

"The families of two frail and elderly pensioners who died after being urgently moved from their troubled care homes have today criticised the Government's watchdog for the rushed closures. After more than a month of the authorities refusing to identify Alfred Dodd and Winifred Lake, their names were today revealed. The 85 and 91-year-old died days after they were evacuated from private care homes Merok Park in Surrey and nearby Grantley Court in Sutton, respectively. Their families fear the sudden closures caused the dementia sufferers unnecessary stress and anxiety. They want to know why a damning inspection report from health watchdogs went unpublished for eight months. The relatives said it could have flagged up serious problems at the homes, as they demanded better planning when relocating vulnerable people in future. Scroll down for video . Officials refused to reveal the names of Alfred Dodd, 85, and Winifred Lake, 91, or how they died . Tragic: Mrs Lake, 91, died from hypertension apparently brought on by the stress of being relocated on December 12 . Mr Dodd, an 85-year-old grandfather, died of pneumonia barely 48 hours after being moved out of Merok Park on December 9, one of the coldest nights of the year. Mrs Lake, 91, died from hypertension apparently brought on by the stress of being relocated from Grantley Court with little notice on December 12. Neither the coroner, the town hall registration officer, police, county council nor the local NHS trust would reveal Mr Dodd’s name and other details of his case and that of Mrs Lake. And they have refused to open inquests into either death. Merok Park, which had the same owners as Grantley Court, was given a clean bill of health in January last year, even though families said it was a ‘hovel’ and neighbours reported screaming to the police. Mr Dodd's family said they are in 'total shock' that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) failed to publish their early concerns about Grantley Court for eight months, and believe the information could have pointed to problems at Merok Park. Staff called for another inspection in September after raising concerns and the CQC found an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine and patients forced to wash in cold water. But rather than replacing or overseeing the management until the residents could be re-homed, the watchdog suddenly ordered the home to close, declaring it a 'serious risk' to residents. Residents were evacuated on a freezing cold night as Merok park was shut, but ambulances ordered by the council failed to show, leaving the elderly people shivering . Shock: Family members of those living at Merok Park were told about the move only hours earlier . Elderly residents were left shivering in their pyjamas on December 9 as Merok Park was shut and ambulances ordered by the council failed to turn up. Family members were told about the move only hours earlier. Mr Dodd’s family accuse the CQC of closing the home at too little notice, causing immense upheaval. Mr Dodd's son Russell, told the Mail: 'Couldn't somebody have moved into that home and looked after those people? 'Whoever made the decision to do what they did, and the time of what they did, that was wrong. 'The CQC and social services - they are the people who have to answer the questions.' The CQC last night apologised for the distress but said responsibility lay with the care homes’ owners and the local councils. It insists it warned Surrey County Council four days before Merok Park was closed. A council spokesman said: ‘When the Care Quality Commission informed us of its intention to serve a notice on this nursing home our role was to organise alternative homes for everyone. ‘Once the CQC’s court order was issued, forcing the residents to leave, this had all been arranged.’ Sutton Council said it was forced to act urgently after owners Soondressen and Maleenee Cooppen decided to close Grantley Court with just 72 hours’ notice. Thought to have made £650,000 a year from each site, the Mauritian couple live in a £2.5million home in south-west London and drive a fleet of luxury cars. Owners Soondressen and Maleenee Cooppen have repeatedly declined to apologise to the families . They allegedly ran the homes on a shoestring and have repeatedly declined to apologise, with Mrs Cooppen telling the Mail: ‘We are not interested.’ A Sutton Council spokesman said: ‘We absolutely did not want to disrupt the lives of older, vulnerable people. We completely sympathise with the families involved.’ Paul Burstow, a Liberal Democrat MP and former care minister, said: ‘The conditions at Grantley Court were shocking. The CQC were right to serve the notice to close the home. 'However, I am concerned that it took so long for the CQC to publish the report from its first inspection – they had already picked up problems and relatives deserved to know.’ Sally Warren, CQC's deputy chief inspector of adult social care in London, said: 'We are sorry that the report on Grantley Court from an inspection last January was not published until September. 'This wasn't good enough - we know that our reports are an important source of information for the public, and that they - alongside regular monitoring visits they do themselves to check up on the safety of the people in their care - are useful for local authorities too. 'When we identified serious concerns at both Grantley Court and Merok Park, we took action straight away. The concerns at Merok Park represented a more serious immediate risk to people's safety, so that home was closed immediately. 'The failings identified at both homes were appalling, and the provider should be ashamed of the 'care' their services were delivering.' Police are investigating unexplained injuries suffered by four dementia patients at Grantley Court. With his doting granddaughter by his side, Alfred Dodd celebrates turning 85 on Christmas Day in 2013. Although fragile and bruised, he is surrounded by cards and a birthday balloon from his adoring family. Less than a year later, Mr Dodd died after being forced out of his care home on one of the coldest nights of the year. Mr Dodd, 85, died from bronchopneumonia, a lung infection usually linked to a cold or flu, after residents were moved from Merok park (pictured) How the Mail reported the tragic events at the care homes last December . The great-grandfather’s death was shrouded in secrecy with a coroner deciding not to hold an inquest into his death and authorities refusing to reveal his name. Mr Dodd, who was known to friends as Mick, died from pneumonia less than 48 hours after the upheaval of the move from Merok Park in Banstead, Surrey. His formal causes of death include bronchopneumonia, a lung infection usually linked to a cold or flu. He also had prostate cancer and a urine infection. His family are now calling for the Care Quality Commission to answer urgent questions about why the ‘terrible’ evacuation was ordered with such little notice. Their call is echoed by the family of Winifred Lake, a 91-year-old great-grandmother who died less than two weeks after she was suddenly moved from the care home where she had lived for 25 years. They believe she would still be alive if she was not forced out so suddenly. Mr Dodd, who was married to Barbara, 75, had a son, two daughters, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. The former office manager had become desperately unwell with dementia and was taken to hospital just over a year ago. While his family were reluctant to have him put in full-time care, they eventually had him placed at Merok Park, with the costs covered in part by the family and by his pension. Mr Dodd’s son Russell, 55, a construction manager from Chipstead, Surrey, said they were in ‘total shock’ to discover there had been official reports of an ‘overwhelming’ smell of urine at Merok Park with residents forced to bathe in cold water. Despite the CQC’s findings, they believe inspectors should have managed a measured evacuation of the home, taking it over for a time before allowing residents to be moved when they were ready. Instead, Mr Dodd’s son was told about the move just a few hours before it took place on December 9 last year. Mr Dodd, who bruised easily and was suffering with a large pressure sore, was evacuated in the dark at about 5.30pm. His son said: ‘Couldn’t somebody have moved into that home and looked after those people? 'Whoever made the decision to do what they did and the time of what they did, that was wrong. ‘The CQC and social services – they are the people that have to answer the questions.’ Mr Dodd’s grandson Oliver, 17, added: ‘I don’t think it’s right to just shut the place down and chuck people out in the cold. 'He was already on the edge. That could have put him over the edge.’ Mr Dodd’s daughter Julie said they were assured by the coroner he died of natural causes and not because of the move. Mrs Lake was at Grantley Court for nearly 25 years until the south London nursing home, which has the same owners as Merok Park, was evacuated on December 12, at two days’ notice. Her family believe her death on Christmas Day, partly from hypertension, was caused by the upheaval. Tony Lake, 62, said he visited his mother the day after the move and noticed her anxiety. He added: ‘From then on in she didn’t eat and she was reluctant to drink. The cause for her not being here now is the move,’ he said. ‘It was the suddenness of it – not being able to prepare for it. The swiftness of the move was too much stress and led to her sudden deterioration. They [the CQC] had known all that time but they left it until the last minute. Lessons need to be learnt from this.’","Pensioners who died following bungled care home closures finally named .

"David Cameron, pictured speaking at the Nato summit, said the West faced a generational struggle against poisonous extremism and all options would be considered to support regional allies . Britain last night signed up to a mission to crush the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. David Cameron said the West faced a generational struggle against poisonous extremism and all options would be considered to support regional allies. Barack Obama declared: ‘The bottom line is we will do what is necessary.’ The US president’s secretary of state said it might take years but the self-styled caliphate would be wiped out. John Kerry told the Nato summit in Newport, Wales: ‘Leaving them in some capacity intact anywhere would leave a cancer in place that will ultimately come back to haunt us.’ The US asked nine other countries to join what it called a ‘core coalition’ against IS: Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Italy, Poland and Denmark. Mr Cameron said: ‘Clearly, military commitment is required and what I’ve said is that nothing is ruled out. We’ll act in our national interest.’ However, the Prime Minister stressed Britain was ‘not yet at that stage’ and joining air strikes could only happen after the formation of a properly representative government in Iraq. One senior Government source urged people to ‘cool the jets’ on the prospect of Britain joining the US in air strikes within days. The source said a meeting of the UN general assembly in New York in three weeks would be a crucial moment. As well as bringing horror to the people of northern Iraq, Islamic State – known as IS or Isil – has murdered two US hostages and threatened to kill British aid worker David Haines. The US and the UK want to avoid the mistakes of the Blair-Bush era and taking military action with little support from regional powers or a clear post-conflict plan. Mr Obama drew criticism last week after admitting he had no strategy for confronting IS yet. He faces unpalatable choices about new alliances. Former foe Iran is understood to have agreed to talks about how to contain the threat. In Syria, the role of President Assad, who was the target of proposed air strikes by the US and the UK a year ago, will also be crucial. Barack Obama and the United States has asked nine other countries to join what it called a ‘core coalition’ against IS: Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Italy, Poland and Denmark . The US has already launched limited air strikes in Iraq, but only when IS was advancing and threatening new humanitarian catastrophes. The mission now being contemplated is far wider and will involve seeking to crush jihadists in areas they have already seized. ‘Our goal is to act with urgency,’ the US president said. ‘We have a strong political coalition. We are going to degrade and destroy Isil.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘We must use all the instruments at our disposal – humanitarian, diplomatic and military. We have agreed to offer a Nato training mission for Iraq as soon as a new Iraqi government is in place. The fight against IS must be led by the Iraqis themselves. But we will continue to encourage countries in the region to support this effort and to work with our partners on the ground to take all necessary steps to squeeze this barbaric terrorist organisation out of existence.’ ÷ The leader of Somalia’s al-Shabaab terror group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was killed in a US air strike, the Pentagon says. He was one of the world’s most wanted terrorists, with a £5million bounty on his head. Special forces used missiles to destroy a camp and a vehicle on Monday, but did not confirm Godane had been killed until yesterday.","David Cameron said the West faced a struggle against poisonous extremism .

"The Supreme Court has struck down campaign donation limits that individual donors can make to candidates, political parties and political action committees  in a landmark ruling handed down today. The justices ruled that Americans have a right to give the legal maximum to candidates for Congress and president, as well as to parties and PACs, without worrying that they will violate the law when they bump up against a limit on all contributions. That limit was set at $123,200 for 2013 and 2014. That includes a separate $48,600 cap on contributions to candidates. The decision will allow the wealthiest contributors to pour millions of dollars into candidate and party coffers, although those contributions will be subject to disclosure under federal law. Continued fight: Recent rulings- including the latest one handed down today- have helped wealthy individuals pile limitless funds into their favorite campaigns but comes as a blow to liberal activists (Cornell Woolridge pictured in an October 2013 protest) Big donors already can spend unlimited amounts on attacks ads and other outlets that are not federally regulated, and those venues have played an increasingly important role in campaigns. But the court's 5-4 decision does not undermine limits on individual contributions to candidates for president or Congress, now $2,600 an election. Chief Justice John Roberts announced the decision, which split the court's liberal and conservative justices. Roberts said the aggregate limits do not act to prevent corruption, the rationale the court has upheld as justifying contribution limits. The overall limits ‘intrude without justification on a citizen's ability to exercise 'the most fundamental First Amendment activities,'‘ Roberts said, quoting from the court's seminal 1976 campaign finance ruling in Buckley v. Valeo. Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with the outcome of the case, but wrote separately to say that he would have gone further and wiped away all contribution limits. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the liberal dissenters, said that the court's conservatives had ‘eviscerated our nation's campaign finance laws’ through Wednesday's ruling and 2010 decision in Citizens United that lifted limits on independent spending by corporations and labor unions. ‘If the court in Citizens United opened a door, today's decision we fear will open a floodgate,’ Breyer said in comments from the bench. Close call: The court's 5-4 decision does not undermine limits on individual contributions to candidates for president or Congress, now $2,600 an election . ‘It understates the importance of protecting the political integrity of our governmental institution. It creates, we think, a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate's campaign.’ Congress enacted the limits in the wake of Watergate-era abuses to discourage big contributors from trying to buy votes with their donations and to restore public confidence in the campaign finance system. But in a series of rulings in recent years, the Roberts court has struck down provisions of federal law aimed at limiting the influence of big donors as unconstitutional curbs on free speech rights. Most notably, in 2010, the court divided 5 to 4 in the Citizens United case to free corporations and labor unions to spend as much as they wish on campaign advocacy, as long as it is independent of candidates and their campaigns. That decision did not affect contribution limits to individual candidates, political parties and political action committees. Republican activist Shaun McCutcheon of Hoover, Alabama, the national Republican party and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky challenged the overall limits on what contributors may give in a two-year federal election cycle. The total is $123,200, including a separate $48,600 cap on contributions to candidates, for 2013 and 2014. Conservative victory: Justice Clarence Thomas (bottom left) wrote that he supported the decision but would have gone further and gotten rid of all spending limits entirely . Limits on individual contributions, currently $2,600 per election to candidates for Congress, are not at issue. Relaxed campaign finance rules have reduced the influence of political parties, McConnell and the GOP argued. McCutcheon gave the symbolically significant $1,776 to 15 candidates for Congress and wanted to give the same amount to 12 others. But doing so would have put him in violation of the cap. Nearly 650 donors contributed the maximum amount to candidates, PACs and parties in the last election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The court did not heed warnings from Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. and advocates of campaign finance limits that donors would be able to funnel large amounts of money to a favored candidate in the absence of the overall limit. The Republicans also called on the court to abandon its practice over nearly 40 years of evaluating limits on contributions less skeptically than restrictions on spending. The differing levels of scrutiny have allowed the court to uphold most contribution limits, because of the potential for corruption in large direct donations to candidates. At the same time, the court has found that independent spending does not pose the same risk of corruption and has applied a higher level of scrutiny to laws that seek to limit spending. If the court were to drop the distinction between contributions and expenditures, even limits on contributions to individual candidates for Congress, currently $2,600 per election, would be threatened, said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime supporter of stringent campaign finance laws.","Today's ruling means that donors can give the maximum amount to a candidate's campaign, their PAC, and their political party without worrying about the total limit .
Wealthy contributors could theoretically spend millions on the same candidate by giving to different groups supporting the same person .
$2,600 limit for specific candidates and the president remains intact .

"A series of car bombs in mainly Shi'ite areas of Baghdad killed 69 people and wounded at least 140 on Saturday, police and medical sources said. The attacks come during a surge in violence in Iraq since the start of the year. The wave of separate explosions targeted markets and busy shopping streets. The bombings, which appeared coordinated, were similar to attacks in Baghdad on Tuesday in which 50 were killed. Scroll down for video . Bloodshed: Smoke rises from the scene of a car bomb attack in Kadhimiya, Baghdad. A wave of car bombings targeted cafes and markets around the Iraqi capital as people celebrated the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . Carnage: Iraqi security forces personnel inspect the site of a car bomb attack in Kerbala 68 miles south of Baghdad . Bombing: The bloodshed comes after Iraqi security forces promised to step up efforts to increase security to protect the public during Ramadan. This year's Ramadan was the most violent since 2007, with 671 people killed . Responsibility: No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, though security forces and civilians are frequently targeted by al-Qaida's Iraq branch . The bloodshed also comes after Iraqi security forces promised to step up efforts to increase security to protect the public during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations that mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. This year's Ramadan was the most violent since 2007, with 671 people killed. 'My shop's windows were smashed and smoke filled the whole area,' said shoe shop owner Saif Mousa, who survived an attack near his store in New Baghdad. 'I went outside of the shop and I could hardly see because of the smoke... At the end, we had a terrible day that was supposed to be nice because of Eid.' Many of the attacks occurred within an hour of each other, suggesting a level of coordination in the assaults. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, though security forces and civilians are frequently targeted by al-Qaida's Iraq branch. Sunni Islamist militants have been regaining momentum in their insurgency against the Shi'ite-led government and have been emboldened by the civil war in neighboring Syria, which has stoked sectarian tensions across the Middle East. Police said the deadliest of Saturday's attacks took place when a suicide bomber drove his explosive-laden car into a residential area in the town of Tuz Khormato, killing eight people and wounding dozens, Mayor Shalal Abdool said. The town is about 200 kilometers (130 miles) north of the Iraqi capital. Surge in violence: The death toll in the attacks is the highest single-day total since July 20, when brazen assaults on two prisons near Baghdad plus other attacks left 71 dead . Security fears: More than 1,000 people were killed in Iraq in July, the highest monthly death toll in five years, according to the United Nations . Police said a car bomb exploded near an outdoor market in the Baghdad's southeastern suburbs of Jisr Diyala shortly before sunset, killing seven people and wounding 20. Also in southeastern Baghdad, officials said a car bomb went off inside a parking lot in the mainly Shiite New Baghdad neighborhood, killing three people. Another car bomb exploded in a busy street in the Shiite neighborhood of Amil, killing three people and wounding 14, authorities said. They said another car bomb in Amil killed 3 people and wounded 14.  In the holy Shiite city of Karbala, police said four people were killed in a car bomb attack near a cafe at night. Karbala is 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Baghdad. Police said four people were killed and 15 wounded when a car bomb exploded near a cafe in Baghdad's Shiite neighborhood of Abu Dashir. In northern Baghdad, a car bomb hit a restaurant in the Shiite area of Khazimiyah, killing five people and wounding 14, authorities said. Police also said that five people were killed when a car bomb exploded near a cafe in Baghdad's southwestern neighborhood of Baiyaa. Six people were killed and 15 were wounded in a car bomb explosion in the Shiite neighborhood of Shaab in northeastern Baghdad, officials said. A car bomb hit near a restaurant in the city's northeastern suburb of Husseiniyah, killing seven people and wounding 15, police said.  Also, a car bomb explosion a commercial street in the Dora area in southern Baghdad killed five and wounded 15, authorities said. Concern: The U.N. described the increase as particularly troubling because the numbers had begun declining five years ago following a series of U.S.-led offensives and a Sunni revolt against al-Qaida in Iraq . Strategic shift: Iraqi officials have attributed the recent uptick in the death toll figures to a change in tactics by insurgents who are now trying to attack crowded, soft civilian targets such as cafes, mosques and markets . Earlier in the day, four people, including two children, were killed when a bomb exploded near a park just south of Baghdad, authorities said. Later, a car bomb exploded in a busy street in Nasiriyah city in southern Iraq, killing four people and wounding 41 others, officials said. Nasiriyah is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Baghdad. In the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, a car bomb hit near a Shiite mosque, killing one person and wounding 20 others, police said. Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures for all the attacks. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to journalists. The death toll in Saturday's attacks is the highest single-day total since July 20, when brazen assaults on two prisons near Baghdad plus other attacks left 71 dead.

"More than two thirds of British adults say they have unfulfilled travel ambitions, according to a new study. Research carried out by travel website lastminute.com into the nation’s holiday habits reveals that 34 million Brits over the age of 18 have unaccomplished travel dreams of seeing polar bears, storm chasing or trekking through the wilderness. But despite ambitious fantasies, when it comes to booking holidays 29 million people, or 57 per cent of us, admitted being stuck in a holiday rut by travelling to the same places as previous years. Of those surveyed, 57 per cent said they visit the same places when they go on holiday (pictured: Benidorm) More than two thirds of British adults say they have unfulfilled travel ambitions including seeing polar bears, storm chasing or trekking through the wilderness, according to a survey of holiday habits by lastminute.com . The survey also showed that one in four Brits are hoping to escape four times or more this year, while the average Brit will get away nearly three times. People plan to travel one extra day than they did last year - 16 compared to the 15 days taken in 2014. One in four even admitted they won't hesitate to throw a sickie to extend their average 26 days of annual leave from work, while more than a quarter feel they didn't make the most of their annual leave last year. We are also more willing to splash the cash on travel with 38 per cent willing to spend about the same as last year, 30 per cent a bit more and 10 per cent are prepared to double their 2014 travel spend, according to the research. White water rafting and free diving have made it in to the top ten activities to do while on holiday . However, not even 10 per cent will fulfil their lofty travel dreams, according to the research. Instead, a majority will play it safe and opt for more traditional holidays. While the UK continues to be the top travel destination for Britons (36 per cent), the strength of the pound versus the euro has seen a resurgence of Euro-zone countries making up the top five overseas destinations we want to visit. A quarter of those polled said Spain was their favoured destination, followed by France with 18 per cent, the US with 13 per cent, Italy with 12 per cent and Greece with 10 per cent. New trend destinations, although on a smaller level, include Austria, the Caribbean and Croatia. When it comes to the types of travel Brits dream of this year, it is beach holidays and city breaks that rule, with a bit of weekend relaxation thrown in for good measure. Sightseeing was the most popular activity for Brits while on holiday, with 54 per cent of people favouring it . The 2015 holiday ambitions study also found, we are no longer a nation of sun worshipers as we increasingly search for new and exciting experiences rather than a tan line. This year, sunbathing slipped two places in the list of holiday priorities, and was overtaken by sightseeing, experiencing local food and cultural excursions in the top five holiday activity wish list. Sightseeing was the most popular activity for Brits while on holiday, with 54 per cent of people saying they would visit local attractions. The UK continues to be the top travel destination for Brits (36 per cent), but there has been a resurgence of Euro-zone countries making up the top five overseas destinations, with Spain the most favoured country . France was the second most popular overseas destination, with 18 per cent of Brits saying they wanted to visit. The US was in third place with 13 per cent, followed by Italy (12 per cent) and Greece (10 per cent) Experiencing local food was rated as the second most popular activity, with 45 per cent of the vote, followed by cultural excursions with 39 per cent and sun bathing on 32 per cent. Going to the theatre or opera accounted for 23 per cent of the vote, followed by spa treatments (17.9 per cent), snorkelling (14.1 per cent), hiking (12.1 per cent), white water rafting (8.7 per cent) and free diving (8.5 per cent) making up the top ten. Reigo Eljas, trading director at lastminute.com, said: ‘When it comes to travel ambitions they seem a bit like New Year's resolutions: Good intentions, big dreams, high hopes - but in reality we don't see them through. ‘We all love a lazy beach holiday and want to see the Eiffel Tower, but this year we encourage people to be spontaneous and use one of their breaks to make their travel dreams become a reality.’","Lastminute.com reveals 29 million Brits travel to same place each year .

It comes just days after elite government troops reportedly advanced in and around Aleppo in what appeared to be an attempt to lay siege to rebel-held parts in a 'major showdown'. A man carries a baby as he rushes from an ambulance in the eastern Shaar neighborhood of Aleppo today . Aleppo, once Syria's commercial center, has been carved up into rebel-and government-controlled areas since an opposition offensive in mid-2012. The push also came a month after extremist fighters of the Islamic State group seized territories straddling Syria and neighboring Iraq, where they have declared a self-styled caliphate. Most of the land was seized in June during a push across Iraq. Abdurrahman and an activist based near the city who goes by the name of Abu al-Hassan said Monday's fighting was concentrated near an army base known as the Infantry Academy that rebels captured two years ago. 'The latest attack does not mean that Aleppo will fall. It is going to be a very difficult battle,' said Abdurrahman, whose group has a network of activists around the country. He said the aim of government forces currently is to try capture Aleppo's northern district of Handarat to be able to further close in on rebels. Syria's crisis began in March 2011 as largely peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's rule. It turned into an armed uprising after some opposition supporters picked up weapons to fight a brutal government crackdown on dissent. It gradually became a civil war, in which more than 160,000 people have been killed, according to activists, and nearly a third of Syria's population of 23 million has been displaced . A third of those killed have been civilians.","Dutch Jihadi, known as Yilmaz, has confirmed he is training UK teenagers .

"David Haines, who was beheaded in a gruesome video released by ISIS after being kidnapped by the terror group . The teenage daughter of murdered British hostage David Haines has said her father would have been touched by all the messages of support her family have received. Mr Haines daughter Bethany has broken her silence and spoke out after her father was beheaded in a gruesome video released by the British Islamic State terrorist who has been dubbed 'Jihadi John'. The 44-year-old, from Perth in Scotland, had been in Syria working for French aid agency ACTED when he was kidnapped. On Saturday, ISIS released a video purportedly to show the beheading of the British aid worker. The video provoked outrage, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling Mr Haines a 'British hero', dedicating his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines. And writing on a Facebook page dedicated to her father, Bethany posted: 'Hi, I'm David's daughter who lives in Perth. 'I was really touched by the messages of support during this hard time I know my dad would be really touched and grateful.' It comes after Mr Haines brother Mike had to break the news to the 17-year-old that her father had been killed. Miss Haines was said to have been inconsolable since her father was kidnapped in March last year. Scroll down for video . On Sunday, the college student, speaking from the home she shares with her mother Louise, in Scone, Perthshire, said: ‘We’re pulling through.’ While another relative, her maternal uncle, said Bethany was ‘very shocked and devastated’, adding: ‘It’s a very difficult time.’ Mr Haines also had another four-year-old daughter, called Athea, in Croatia, where he was living with his second wife. Yesterday Mr Haines' brother, Mike, also paid a heartfelt tribute to him and said he was 'murdered in cold blood.' The video, which shows Mr Haines and the British jihadist dubbed 'Jihadi John' provoked outrage, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling Mr Haines a 'British hero' Born and raised in Scotland, Mr Haines had moved to Croatia to live with his second wife Dragana, 45 (right). They met when she was working as a translator and he wore a kilt at their wedding ceremony . He explained: 'David and I were brought up to know right from wrong, although we might not with the innocence of youth have always chosen right. ‘David was a good brother, there when I needed him and absent when I didn’t. I hope that he felt the same way about me.’ Mr Haines said radicalisation presented a threat to the ‘safety of every person in the world’, adding: ‘Increasingly we are seeing more and more radicalisation in every walk of life.’ The father-of-two had worked for a series of aid organisations after leaving the RAF, including in Croatia, South Sudan and Libya. His last mission was with the French non-governmental organisation ACTED, the Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development, which works to support civilians affected by war. He was supporting the emergency humanitarian response at a Syrian refugee camp near to the Turkish border when he was kidnapped. Father of two Alan Henning, a taxi driver from Manchester (pictured at a Syrian aid camp) was paraded at the end of a horrific new video showing the beheading of British hostage David Haines – implying he will be next . The team was working to improve the supply of water, food and tents for the growing number of refugees. Meanwhile fears are now being raised for a second British hostage, Alan Henning, who is also being held hostage by ISIS militants. Mr Henning, a taxi driver from Manchester, appeared at the end of the chilling video, which showed Mr Haines death with Jihadi John pointing a knife at his head - implying he would be next. He was making one last trip to Syria to help those caught up in the conflict when he was seized by Islamist militants and paraded in front of cameras in their latest beheading video. Prime Minister David Cameron, has remained cautious saying of ISIS, 'they are not Muslims, they are monsters' The grotesque images sparked immediate demands from MPs and former military commanders for the UK to quickly join international air strikes in Iraq and Syria and not to rule out sending in ground troops. Last month, videos showing the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were also released by the Islamic State. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said it was ‘time for retribution’ and to ‘kill their barbaric fighters.’ Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, urged Mr Cameron to join international strikes against Islamic State ‘in the strongest possible way’. Speaking after a meeting of the UK emergency committee Cobra, Mr Cameron remained cautious as he said of IS ‘they are not Muslims, they are monsters’. He added: ‘We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.’","Bethany Haines has spoke out after murder of her father at the hands of ISIS .

"The NSA isn’t just reading the emails of American connected to terrorists, the agency is searching virtually all communications Americans send across the border for the mention of anything even resembling information about overseas surveillance targets. New information reveals that even a Facebook message about al-qaeda sent as a joke or an email sent to a cousin named Osama might trip NSA surveillance software designed to filter through every message sent from American soil to a recipient abroad. This means that just about any message sent overseas could be read by the NSA as computers flag potentially suspicious message for examination by humans. Information overload: A report in July showed the NSA is doing a lot more than spying on Americans with terrorist connections, perhaps with the help of its $1.7 billion Utah Data Center . By identifying the recipient of the emails or text messages as the target of the surveillance instead of the sender, the NSA sidesteps a 2008 law that allows spying on domestic soil without warrants as long as the target was a noncitizen abroad. This, according to a shocking New York Times report out Thursday, which cites a senior source inside the NSA. ‘To conduct the surveillance,’ reads the report, ‘the NSA. is temporarily copying and then sifting through the contents of what is apparently most e-mails and other text-based communications that cross the border…[the] computer searches the data for the identifying keywords or other “selectors” and stores those that match so that human analysts could later examine them.’ Leaked: The revelation was at least partially couched in information leaked by Edward Snowden, which hinted at the expansive reach of the NSA's surveillance program . More convenient: According to the New York Times, the agency searches virtually all emails sent from Americans to recipients overseas. Seen here is the 28-acre NSA facility outside Baltimore, Maryland . The official said the remaining emails, those not selected by the software, are deleted. Nonetheless, privacy proponents were in disbelief. ‘The program described by the New York Times involves a breathtaking invasion of millions of people's privacy,’ American Civil Liberties Union deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement. ‘The NSA has cast a massive dragnet over Americans' international communications, collecting and monitoring virtually all of them, and retaining some untold number of them in government databases. This is precisely the kind of generalized spying that the Fourth Amendment was intended to prohibit.’ Jaffer, and undoubtedly others like him, fear the news could equal an invasion of free speech. Though it was previously known the NSA targets Americans with known terrorist associations, new evidence shows the agency is far less discriminating as it combs messages for names and emails related to its targets . ‘The government's scrutiny of virtually every international email sent by Americans will have extraordinary consequences for free expression,’ wrote Jaffer. ‘Americans will inevitably hesitate to discuss controversial topics, visit politically sensitive websites or interact with foreigners with dissenting views. By injecting the NSA into virtually every cross-border interaction, the U.S. government will forever alter what has always been an open exchange of ideas.’ The NSA, meanwhile, all but declined to respond to the new allegations. ‘In carrying out its signals intelligence mission, N.S.A. collects only what it is explicitly authorized to collect,’ said NSA spokeswoman Judith A. Emmel. ‘Moreover, the agency’s activities are deployed only in response to requirements for information to protect the country and its interests.’ Emmel did not directly address the surveillance of cross-border communications, but did stress that surveillance carried out by the agency is intended to gather information about 'foreign powers and their agents, foreign organizations, foreign persons or international terrorists' and not about American citizens.","An message sent to a cousin named Osama may now be enough to make any American a target of surveillance .
The information was couched in a set of rules leaked by Edward Snowden about a 2008 domestic surveillance law .
The NSA can read the emails simply by defining the foreign recipient, and not the American sender, as their target ."
"Bath expect Sam Burgess will need six weeks to recover from his broken cheekbone after an heroic, match-winning performance in Sunday's NRL Grand Final in Sydney which confirmed his place in rugby league folklore. The 25-year-old, who moves to the rugby union side later this month, is due to have surgery, having suffered the injury in the first minute against Canterbury Bulldogs and gone on to play the full game.

His five-year stint with the South Sydney Rabbitohs ended in glorious fashion, as he gallantly inspired the club’s first NRL title in 43 years — making 36 tackles and running 225 metres. He was in tears at the end, before being chaired off the pitch and becoming the first non-Australian to win the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match in a Grand Final. Asked about the injury at half-time, he blurted out: ‘It’s f*****. It’s gone.’ After the game, he added: ‘To be honest I couldn’t feel the pain. I knew I’d broken it straight away. My face felt numb and I had blurred vision.’ Burgess twin brothers — Tom and George — also made telling impacts as their mother Julie watched in the stands.

"A young woman and her boyfriend are pursuing legal action against Thomas Cook after they became severely ill during their stay at an Egyptian hotel. Kayleigh Stannard, 26, and Luke Burns, 23, claim their ‘holiday from hell’ was caused by unsanitary conditions at the Stella Makadi Beach & Gardens Hotel in the resort of Makadi Bay last November. The couple says they noticed insects around the eatery and birds inside the dining area, and chefs and kitchen staff were not wearing gloves when handling food. 'Holiday from hell': Kayleigh Stannard and Luke Burns say they became ill during their Egyptian getaway . They both fell ill midway through what was supposed to be a relaxing holiday in the sun, suffering from diarrhoea and severe abdominal pains. Kayleigh developed a rash on her legs and was forced to take a week off work due to ongoing symptoms after she returned to her home in Horsforth, Leeds, West Yorkshire. She visited her GP and was shocked when she was diagnosed with Trichostrongylus (round worms), a parasite that occurs through the ingestion of infected larvae. The post office worker said: ‘It was such a shock to return home and hear that I had contracted a parasite. The illness ruined the holiday for me and my partner, Luke.’ Relaxing: A beach at the popular resort of Makadi Bay, Egypt is pictured in a file photo . She added: ‘The conditions in the hotel's . dining area were worrying; we saw chefs handling food without wearing . gloves quite a few times and on occasions there were insects and birds . flying around where the food was being served and eaten. ‘This was supposed to be a dream holiday but it quickly turned into an absolute nightmare. It should have been a holiday to remember but is definitely something I'd rather forget.’ The couple have instructed travel lawyers from Irwin Mitchell to look into their case. Travel law expert Elizabeth Tetzner said Irwin Mitchell is investigating how the couple became ill and how Kayleigh became infected with the parasite. The young couple has hired travel lawyers from Irwin Mitchell to look into their case against Thomas Cook . She said: ‘The infection resulted in Kayleigh becoming extremely ill over a number of days and Luke suffered from similar symptoms - ruining their holiday and resulting in Kayleigh taking time off work for recovery when she returned back home. ""We hope that Thomas Cook will now work with us to provide Kayleigh and Luke with the answers they clearly need about these issues to allow them to move on and put the experience behind them. ‘Gastric illness can have a devastating, impact on people's health and the effects of it cannot be underestimated.’ In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, Thomas Cook said it takes health and hygiene issues extremely seriously and it closely audits all the properties to which it operates. The travel company said its records show that sickness levels among customers staying at the resort were minimal during the couple’s stay. A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: ‘The health and safety of our customers is of the utmost importance to us, and we are always concerned to hear of any illness reported while on holiday. ‘We can confirm that we have been approached by a no-win, no-fee lawyer on behalf of Ms Stannard and Mr Burns. ‘As a result, and while our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to prejudice any future legal proceedings.’ The statement added: ‘We are confident that those due to stay at the hotel will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from Thomas Cook. ‘We ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.’","Kayleigh Stannard and Luke Burns suffered symptoms their stay in Egypt .

"A 19-year-old  girl who is suffering from terminal brain cancer has spoken of her daily battle with the disease - weeks after achieving her dream to play college basketball. Lauren Hill, from Lawrenceburg, Indiana, was diagnosed with  diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) - a rare and inoperable tumor in the brain stem - 14 months ago. In recent months, her condition has worsened: she now frequently suffers from severe headaches, dizziness and numbness in her body, leaving her dependent on her family and friends. Speaking of her life with the disease, she said candidly:  'My body is shutting down, and there's nothing I can do. It's like losing your independence a bit. Being dependent is kind of hard.' Scroll down for video . Brave: Lauren Hill, 19, has spoken of her daily battle with terminal  cancer- weeks after achieving her dream to play college basketball. Above, the teen plays basketball for Mount St Joseph's University on November 2 . Tragic: The teenager (pictured, left, before her diagnosis and right, after), from Lawrenceburg, was diagnosed with an inoperable form of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) - a rare brain tumor - 14 months ago . The teenager, who last month fulfilled her wish to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph University's Division III team in Cincinnati, said she has 'good hours' and 'bad hours' every day. 'I have hour spurts when I feel fine and I can walk normal and stuff. Other hours, I'm wobbling. I feel like there's somebody behind me kicking my legs out from under me,' she told USA Today Sports. She added that dying makes her feel like she is in a rush to complete everything she wants to do, including her brave, ongoing campaign to raise awareness and fund research into DIPG. 'What is it like to know you're dying? It's like I want to get stuff done. Like I'm in a rush. People are told they have five weeks to live, and they live five years. I don't know,' she said. 'I want everybody to know I never give up, even though I have my low moments and I feel like giving up, because they're awful. My family gets me back on track to my never-give-up.' She said her main concern was not for herself, but for 'my family and friends after I've gone'. Her passion: In recent months, Lauren's condition has worsened: she now  suffers from severe headaches, dizziness and numbness in her body. But she looked on great form as she played basketball last month . Opening up: Speaking of her life with the disease, the teenager (right) said candidly: 'My body is shutting down, and there's nothing I can do. It's like losing your independence a bit. Being dependent is kind of hard' Award: 'I have hour spurts when I feel fine and I can walk normal and stuff. Other hours, I'm wobbling,' she added. Above, Lauren receives the Pat Summitt award during the basketball game - her first of three games . Indeed, Lauren has not let her terminal illness stop her from fundraising for research into DIPG, which claims the lives of more than 90 per cent of its child victims within 18 months of diagnosis. She has already raised more than $500,000 - and aims to increase this figure to $1million by the end of the year, despite being previously told by doctors she would likely die by December. A Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a rare an inoperable type of brain tumor. It mostly affects children, with most diagnoses occurring between five and seven years of age. More than 90 per cent of its victims will die within 18 months of diagnosis. Each year, there are around 100-150 new diagnoses in the United States. The cause of the tumor remains unknown. Symptoms include lack of facial control, double vision, headaches, vomiting, weakness, seizures and balance problems. She has been spurred on in her fundraising efforts by her knowledge that medics have not made any progress for 30 years toward finding a cure for the deadly cancer, she said. DIPG, which is usually diagnosed between the ages of five and seven, affects around 100 to 150 children in the U.S. every year. Since her first game for Mount St. Joseph in early November, 5ft 10ins Lauren, who wants to be 'a voice for children with this cancer' has played two more basketball games for the university. Due to her devastating prognosis, the NCAA approved a waiver for Mount St Joseph to start its season two weeks earlier, and the team tipped off against Hiram College with Lauren on court. On November 6, the talented university freshman joined a number of top athletes who have had their photos printed on a box of Wheaties, the Breakfast of Champions. In Lauren's picture, she could seen playing in the first of the three basketball games, during which she scored the first points of the winning match.

"The terror warlord who has declared himself leader of the Muslim world, but was criticsed for wearing an expensive-looking wristwatch, may have instead been wearing a more modest item designed to predict prayer times. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State - known formerly as ISIS - recently declared himself leader of a Muslim caliphate and launched a scathing attack on the West. But his fearsome address - in which he demanded loyalty from the world's 1.2billion Muslims and hailed 'long years of jihad' - was undermined by his outfit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Public address: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was mocked for demanding loyalty from Muslims worldwide while sporting a flashy watch . Zoom: Some speculated online that it was a Rolex or Omega piece costing thousands of pounds . Though he wore traditional black robes and a turban for his sermon in the captured city of Mosul, he could also be seen sporting a bulky, silver wrist watch. Fit for a caliph: Jihadists online claim that, rather than a Rolex, al-Baghdadi was wearing the Al-Fajr WA-10S Deluxe, pictured above . Viewers of his video quickly latched on to the incongruous piece of jewellery, suggesting that it could be a Rolex, Sekonda or a £3,500 Omega Seamaster - trappings of the Western world he despises. But today Islamist supporters of the caliph hit back, saying that his watch is in fact a Al-Fajr WA-10S Deluxe watch, which can predict calls to prayer worldwide, according to the Telegraph. It has not been confirmed whether the watch is the exact model he wears, but if it were it would offer Al-Baghdadi features including a compass pointing to Mecca and the option to set the date by the Gregorian calendar or a Muslim equivalent. Social media posts from on user explained: 'Al-Fajr watches are really good - It beebs when it's Salah (prayer) time. Alhamdulilah! The Shaykh has good taste.' Another added: 'I want this!!! N i want his black turban too.!' The public appearance - a rarity for the leader dubbed 'the invisible Sheikh' - seemed to be an attempt to mimic Muslim leaders of 1,000 years ago, when Islamic empires ruled huge, unified tracts of the world. Described . as the world’s most wanted man, militants operating under Baghdadi’s . control have spread terror through Syria and Iraq in an attempt to form a . new Islamic state in the Middle East. The . Sunni fighters, responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands, have . vowed to expand the so-called caliphate to huge swathes of Europe and . Africa. Watch me: The self-anointed 'Caliph Ibrahim' conducted a 20-minute sermon wearing the watch this week . Alternative: Despite the criticism some have claimed it is in fact a pious Islamic model . Video footage of . Baghdadi, who has garnered the nickname ‘the invisible sheikh’ due to . his elusive nature, emerged online on Friday and was quickly spread by . jihadi websites. Fighters . from the group – previously known as ISIS - were among those who joined a . packed congregation at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest . city, as he delivered the 21-minute speech. Referring . to himself as ‘the leader who presides over you’, Baghdadi said that he . could return the Muslim world to ‘dignity, might, rights and . leadership.’ He said: ‘I am . the wali (leader) who presides over you, though I am not the best of . you, so if you see that I am right, assist me.’ ‘I am not better than you or more virtuous than you,’ he added. People were quick to spot the watch being worn by al-Baghdadi as he conducted the 20-minute sermon . Another asked on Twitter what make watch the Caliph was wearing during the video . He . also used the sermon to praise his army of fighters, who have taken . control of Mosul only one month before, and called for the strict . interpretation of Islamic law. ‘God . gave your mujahedeen brothers victory after long years of jihad and . patience... so they declared the caliphate and placed the caliph in . charge,’ he said. ‘This is a duty on Muslims that has been lost for centuries.’ The supposition that the wristwatch was an expensive Omega model was particularly embarrassing given that it seemed to contradict the content of his speech. The Seamaster in particular has been styled a 'James Bond' watch in honour of the long-standing association of the spy films with the model. When Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond in 1995 he wore the Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional in the movie GoldenEye. In all later films, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Chronometer. Daniel Craig, who starred in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, also wears the Omega Seamaster. The watch was formerly believed to be either a Rolex, Sekonda or £4,000 Omega Seamaster (pictured) Fit for a spy: Actor Pierce Brosnan as James Bond 007 wearing the Omega Seamaster watch . Only . two images of Baghdadi – who was the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq - are . thought to have existed before his appearance in the video. Reports . have claimed that the terror chief even insists on talking to his . deputies wearing a mask in an effort to protect his identity. Iraqi . officials last night said they were still working to authenticate the . video but it is understood initial investigations have concluded the . preacher is Baghdadi. The US offered £5.8million for information leading to his capture or death in 2011 .

"A narcotics squad on a drugs bust found a woman padlocked in a bedroom where they believe she may have been kept for up to ten years. The third-floor apartment of Michael Mendez, 41, was being searched because he has strong links to the violent Latin Kings street gang. Officers found the 44-year-old woman imprisoned at the home in Paterson, New Jersey. Drugs bust: Michael Mendez, 41, allegedly held a woman in a padlocked room at his home in Paterson, New Jersey . A police spokesman told MailOnline that based on evidence at the scene, detectives believed that the woman had been locked in the room on and off for at least two years and potentially up to a decade. There was a bucket in the room as a chamber pot, according to NBC New York and Mendez allowed his victim access to a TV. The woman, who has not been identified because she is a victim, was sometimes let out of the room when her captor was home. There was no indication that she had been malnourished but she was currently receiving medical treatment at St Joseph's Medical Center in Paterson. Captive: The woman was kept locked in a room at Alois Place in Paterson, New Jersey . One neighbor at the brick building on Alois Place said he had known Mendez for around 12 years and that Mendez would hang out in the communal areas of the apartment complex. The . highly organized street gang is known for prolific drug trafficking and violence. Founded in the 1940s by Puerto Ricans, it is now mostly made up of Mexican members. There is believed to be 160 chapters in the U.S. with  20 - 35,000 members. Many chapters have developed strong alliances with Mexican cartels to tighten their grip on the U.S. drugs market. Primary sources of income include street dealing of cocaine, heroin and marijuana. Gang colors are black and gold with tattoos and graffiti consisting of five or three-point crowns. Last year, 15 gang members or associates of the Latin Kings - including two Chicago police officers - were indicted in an alleged racketeering conspiracy that resulted in 19 murders. He said he had seen the woman a few times in the past although it was rare. The man, who refused to give his name . because of worries over safety, said he remembered seeing the woman get . into a car a few times. A maintenance worker, who also declined to give his name because of concerns over his safety, remembered the woman 'cussing me out one time when I was doing my work'. Neighbors on either side of Mendez's top-floor apartment said they weren't aware that another person lived in the apartment. 'I didn't see any woman,' said a man who identified himself only as Buddy and opened his door only a few inches as he spoke. 'This is the first I'm hearing of it.' Mendez, whom police said has strong gang ties, was being held at Passaic County Jail on $1million cash bail. The . Latin Kings is a violent street gang who have been previously been . investigated by the FBI for drug trafficking, weapons and racketeering. Mendez was charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and other counts related to drugs. State . police said they found 4,200 prescription pills valued at $100,000, 190 . grams of marijuana valued at nearly $2,000 and nearly $23,000 in cash . inside his apartment. According to court records, Mendez has two prior convictions for aggravated assault, one of which carried a three-month jail term. Prolific violence: Mendez was said to have ties to the Latin Kings gang, who are known for violence and drug trafficking, and can be identified by their striking tattoos .

"With Lent just a few weeks away, chocolate may be among the treats Pope Francis plans to give up for the religious fasting. So he may want to start tucking into this chocolate gift now - a life-sized version of himself moulded out of 1.5tons of Cocoa from Atitlan, in Guatemala, central America. The Pope was presented with the unique chocolate statue of himself in the Vatican by a group of 20 amateurs chocolatiers yesterday. Just in time for Lent: Pope Francis is presented with a life-sized chocolate statue of himself at the Vatican . Students on a course at the Accademia of Maestri Cioccolatieri, near Venice, Italy, spent four weeks creating the chocolate statue in the Pope's image. The students picked the Pope as the person they wanted to make out of chocolate because of his popularity since he was elected the Bishop of Rome in March last year. Chocolate pope: The statue was made by amateur chocolatiers with 1.5 tons of cocoa from Atitlan in Guatemala . But the Pope's simple tastes in food is well documented, so it is unlikely he will try a piece of his chocolate statue. Hailing from Flores, a middle-class neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Pope Francis grew up in a city famous for its meaty cuisine. But he is said to favour frugal, healthy meals made up up fruit, salads and skinless chicken. While he admits to occasionally indulging in an espresso or a glass of wine, but he rarely eats any rich foods. So perhaps the statue will end up raising money for charity - much like the Pope's former Harley Davidson which sold for £200,000 at auction yesterday. The head of the Catholic Church decided to auction off the Dyna Super Glide bike and donate the funds to Caritas Roma, a charity which supports those in need around the world. The 1,585cc Harley Davidson went under the hammer yesterday at Bonhams' Grand Palais auction with an estimate of just £10,000. But the prospect of owning a bike belonging to the Pope became too much for many, sending bidding through the roof. Potential buyers in the room, on the phone and online battled it out for the bike, with offers soon crossing the 100,000 euro (£83,000) mark. Bids continued to come with an online customer winning the auction, paying a staggering 210,000 euros (£175,000). Premiums took the final price to £200,976. Pope Francis looks at a Harley Davidson motorcycle in June 2013 . Pope Francis helped raised more than £200,000 for charity yesterday by selling his signed Harley Davidson.

"Roma gipsy Elisabeta Dano's refusal to work spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism . Wrapped up warm for a day out in town, this is the Roma gipsy whose refusal to work has spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism. Elisabeta Dano, 25, has found herself at the centre of a landmark European case, which has apparently given Britain the green light to block welfare claims from migrants who refuse to work. But while the courts – and her own family – insist she must now get a job, Dano yesterday declared: ‘It is unfair’. The Mail tracked down Dano to a high street apartment in the German city of Leipzig, 120 miles south of Berlin. The newly married mother – whose husband is also unemployed – moved four years ago from Romania to Leipzig, where her sister Cristina had already relocated with her husband and five children. Dano is a convicted criminal who has never worked a day in her life but has been given a State-funded flat and a range of benefits. The European ruling this week, however, means she cannot claim welfare benefits intended for jobseekers because she has made no effort to find employment in Germany. The judgment suggests the UK can, similarly, refuse to pay welfare benefits to migrants who have moved to Britain simply to live off the State. Dano insists she does want to work and is unemployed only because she cannot get a work permit. Speaking as she waited for a tram into the centre of Leipzig, she told the Mail: ‘I came here to babysit for my sister who has five children, but now the children are older I’m not needed as a babysitter any more. I then tried to get a job, but was told I needed a work permit. I applied several times but I was never granted one. It is unfair.’ Dano completed just three years at school in Carei, a small town of 20,000 residents close to the Hungarian border in north-west Romania. She has a five-year-old son, Florin, whose father is unknown. She has no professional training, has never worked, and was sentenced to two years on probation for petty theft while living in Romania. Despite living in Germany since November 2010, she can speak only basic German and can barely read, write or do basic sums. Her sister, Cristina Mihai, said she was desperate for Dano to start supporting herself. ‘I wish my sister would get a job. Anything. Cleaning, yes. I can’t bear the situation any more.’ The European Court of Justice ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith wants to block access to the new Universal Credit for migrants . Dano was apparently given a flat in central Leipzig for her, her husband and her son so she could move out of her sister’s apartment. At the apartment in a smart block above a bank, Dano’s husband said he did not understand what the fuss was about. The European ruling is seen as a boost to the British Government’s welfare reforms and means EU countries do not have to pay jobless EU migrants who emigrate looking to live off state handouts. But critics say the case simply shows that not enough is being done to stop migrants emigrating for handouts – because Dano is still entitled to other benefits. Dano receives £145 a month in child benefit and £105 a month in ‘maintenance’ payments, which she will continue to get from the State. She also applied for ‘basic provision’ benefits worth £300 a month to jobseekers. The local job centre refused this application so Dano appealed to a social court and the case was referred to Luxembourg. This week, the European court rejected her appeal, declaring that rights of free movement depend on migrants not being an ‘unreasonable burden’ to the host country.","Elisabeta Dano was at the centre of a landmark welfare case this week .

"David Luiz has admitted that the arrivals of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas have made his former team Chelsea 'better' since his departure to Paris Saint Germain. The Brazil defender became a cult hero during his three-and-a-half year spell at Stamford Bridge before leaving for Ligue 1 in a £50million deal last summer. Luiz is set to face his ex-team-mates when both sides meet in the Champions League last 16 later this month, with the 27-year-old conceding the Blues are in fine fettle. Speaking to French radio station RMC, Luiz said: 'Yes, Chelsea are better this season. David Luiz will meet his former team-mates when PSG take on Chelsea in the Champions League last 16 .

"Partly blaming unrest in the Middle East on President Barack Obama, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Saturday that Obama has not spoken firmly and forcefully on Israel's behalf and that the country no longer trusts it has the full support of the United States because of him. The Republican governor's remarks came as Israel targeted civilian institutions with suspected ties to the militant organization Hamas and declared it would step up its bombardment of northern Gaza. Israel says it is acting in self-defense against Hamas rockets. No trust: Christie says Israelis no longer trust that they have the support of the United States because President Obama hasn't taken a firm stance against Hamas . Firm: Christie says Obama hasn't dealt firmly enough with militant organizations like Hamas, which is behind rocket attacks against Israel . Rockets: These images show rockets being fired into Israel from Gaza on Saturday . Christie cited the violence sparked by the deaths of three Israeli teenagers and said organizations like Hamas that are engaged in such conflict with Israel 'need to be dealt with, and dealt with firmly.' Obama has not done so during his presidency, Christie told reporters while attending a meeting of the National Governors Association. 'Israel is not sure that they have America's full support like they used to,' Christie said. 'And that's a real failure of this presidency, in my view. And I think the unrest you see in the Middle East is caused in some measure - not completely, but in some measure - by the fact that this president has not acted in a decisive, consistent way.' Christie, who leads the Republican Governors Association, is openly considering a 2016 presidential bid. While he has limited foreign policy experience, the two-term governor has been speaking more aggressively on international affairs in recent months. Protest: Palestinians across the world are protesting the crisis happening in Gaza that they claim is being caused by Israel . Christie said Obama should be focused on trying to bring stability to the region 'by having America be a forceful voice in favor of a democracy like Israel, and be condemning in the strongest terms and with actions the things that are being done by Hamas against Israel.' When asked, Christie declined to say whether Obama should take military action if necessary. When Obama spoke earlier this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said the president condemned the rocket attacks and said Israel has the right to defend itself. He also urged both sides not to escalate the crisis and offered to have the U.S. negotiate a cease-fire, the White House said in a statement. Israel widened its range of Gaza bombing targets to civilian institutions with suspected Hamas ties and deployed ground troops inside Gaza for the first time early Sunday to raid a rocket launching site in the Palestinian territory. More than 156 Palestinians have been killed in five days of bombardment. Air strikes: Billowing smoke is seen rising from Israeli air strikes in Gaza on Saturday . Four Israeli soldiers were hurt in clashes during the brief incursion to destroy a rocket launching site in northern Gaza, the military said. It said they have returned to Israeli territory. It was the first time that Israeli ground troops are known to have entered Gaza in the current offensive. But the operation was carried out by special forces and did not appear to be the beginning of a broad ground offensive. On Saturday, Israel announced it would hit northern Gaza 'with great force' to prevent rocket attacks from there on Israel. One of the Israeli strikes hit a center for the disabled where Palestinians said two patients were killed and four people seriously hurt. In a second attack, on Saturday evening, an Israeli warplane flattened the home of Gaza's police chief and damaged a nearby mosque as evening prayers ended, killing at least 18 people, officials said. Militants: A failed rocket launched by Palestinian militants towards Israel from its border with Gaza . In New York, the U.N. Security Council called unanimously for a cease-fire, while Britain's foreign minister said he will discuss cease-fire efforts with his American, French and German counterparts on Sunday. So far, neither Israel nor Gaza's Hamas rulers have signaled willingness to stop. Israel has carried out more than 1,200 air strikes this week to try to diminish Hamas' ability to fire rockets at Israel, and the chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Motti Almoz, said Saturday there would be more strikes, especially in northern Gaza near the Israeli border. 'We are going to attack there with great force in the next 24 hours due to a very large concentration of Hamas efforts in that area,' he said. Late Saturday, the military said it was ordering Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate 'for their own safety.'","Christie says the president hasn't done enough to crack down on Palestinian militant groups like Hamas .

"An entire classroom of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School was spared after gunman Adam Lanza believed that the room was empty because a piece of black construction paper covered the door's window. The Connecticut State Police investigation into Adam Lanza's killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School has revealed that he studied other mass killings from around the world intently . That chilling detail emerged yesterday as Connecticut State Police compile their report into the tragic sequence of events of December 14th during which Lanza killed 26-people, including 20-first graders before taking his own life as police officers arrived at the school. Sources connected with the inquiry have outlined to The Hartford Courant what happened that morning after Lanza killed his mother, Nancy, in her bed and then set off to the school armed with an assault rifle, two pistols and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Arriving at Sandy Hook Elementary School at 9.35 a.m., Lanza, 20, shot through the glass windows at the school entrance and immediately encountered Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Scherlach, who had been alerted by the gunfire. He shot them both to death on sight. Two teachers were also injured by ricocheting bullets from that initial burst of gunfire. One had been in the school's meeting room with Hochsprung and Scherlach and was wounded in the leg. The other was further down the hallway outside her classroom after rushing out on hearing the shots and was hit in the foot. The member of staff who had been shot in the leg managed to crawl and call the police, which explains the rapid response time of law enforcement to the school. Continuing down the corridor it was then that Lanza apparently walked by the classroom of Kaitlin Roig, who had closed her classroom door on hearing the gunfire. Victoria Soto, 27, (left) is shown in this . undated handout photo was one of six adults killed at Sandy Hook . Elementary School along with Principal Dawn Hochsprung (right) Connecticut State Police lead a line of children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown on Friday, Dec. 14, 2012 after Adam Lanza opened fire killing 20 1st graders . The school had recently performed a practice lockdown drill and the black construction paper that had been put up on the door had been left there - leading Lanza to think the classroom was empty. Roig and her class, sat in petrified silence while they heard Lanza continue past their door. Lanza then walked into the classroom of substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau to find her and the terrified children huddled together at the back of the room trying to hide in a bathroom. The deranged shooter killed Rousseau and all but one of her class. The little girl escaped by playing dead and emerged from the school with her clothes covered in blood saying, 'Mommy, I'm okay, but all my friends are dead.' She was the only survivor from a class of 16. When asked by her parents what she saw, the unnamed girl said she saw someone who was 'angry' and 'very mad.' According to the unnamed source familiar with the report, Lanza then walked back towards teacher Victoria Soto's class and upon entering encountered children cowering under their desks. He fatally shot these students along with Soto and then dramatically his assault rifle jammed - allowing six children from the class to escape out of the classroom while he reloaded. Tragedy: A woman waits to hear about her sister following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December . Police investigating the home of Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook Connecticut have uncovered a dossier regarding every mass murder inside and outside of the United States that he had compiled . Unknown to Lanza, Soto had placed five children in a closet before he entered and opened fire and they were found unharmed after authorities arrived. Authorities have also dispelled the theory that Lanza was shooting at police as they arrived. Despite bullets being fired out of the school as police rushed up the drive to the school, investigators now believe that Lanza was firing at a teacher who was standing by a window. Realizing that police were closing in, Lanza then turned one of the two pistols he was carrying on himself less than five minutes after he began his killing spree and just as police were entering the building. State police have periodically updated the victims' families as the investigation has unfolded. Danbury State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky has said he hopes that the final report on the massacre will be published  by the end of June. Before he set off on his killing spree - Adam Lanza shot his mother Nancy in the face while she slept and then took the assault rifles she kept in a vault in their home . Outlining for the first time what happened that morning, police also have uncovered evidence that Lanza compiled a dossier of 'virtually every mass murder' in the United States and abroad prior to his killing spree according to a law enforcement source connected with the massacre inquiry. While 20-year-old Lanza's obsession with Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik has already been made public, investigators revealed they have found reams of articles about multiple shootings, leading them to speculate he intended to outdo them all. As . part of their ongoing investigation, State Police sources have told the . Stamford Advocate that Lanza was especially interested in the October . 2006 shooting that occurred in a one-room Amish schoolhouse in Lancaster . County, Pennsylvania in 2006. Gunman . Charles Carl Robert IV burst into the school and took hostages and shot . 10 school girls, five fatally, before ending his own life. 'There was a lot of material on the Amish case,' the unnamed source revealed to The Stamford Advocate. Last . month it was reported that investigators discovered evidence that Lanza . had studied Breivik's massacre of 69 people on Utoya Island in July . 2011 - the Norwegian killed 77 people in all, including eight in . bombings in Oslo, which led to him being sentenced in August to 21-years . in prison. Coupled with . the dossier of other mass shootings in the United States and elsewhere, . police came to the conclusion that he was planning to kill more. However, authorities are still trying to piece together information from Lanza's hard drive, which he destroyed before the massacre, to ascertain what he researched, who he may have corresponded with and what websites he visited. Adam Lanza studied the 2006 mass shooting . carried out by Charles Carl Robert IV (left) in which he killed five . Amish school girls as well as the 2011 massacre of 77 people in Norway . by Anders Behring Breivik (right) Indeed, while compiling their investigation, police have discovered evidence that Lanza became extremely efficient in his mastery of his AR-15 Bushmaster assault - leading them believe he had been planning his assault for a long time. The unnamed source said that Lanza used a technique called 'tactical loading', which means to put a fresh magazine into the weapon before emptying the previous one. While many video game fans, such as Lanza was are familiar with this, to exhibit a proficiency in reality makes police think he had done it before. 'It's one thing to do it by pushing a button on a computer,' the source said to The Stamford Advocate. A search and rescue team boat passes by covered bodies of victims from the summer school meeting organised by the ruling Labour Party on Utoeya, on July 23, 2011 after Breiviks shooting spree . 'It's different in a shooting. You have to practice that to be as proficient as he was that morning.' Lanza's killing spree lasted less than five minutes and during that time he fired 152 bullets into two classrooms in the Connecticut elementary school. Lanza also had hundreds more rounds of ammunition on him and in the car that he drove to the school in. While the unnamed source has said that Lanza obtained the guns from a vault his mother had in their home, police are unsure whether he simply knew the combination or if Nancy Lanza left it unlocked.","Investigation .

"The Pope's Harley Davidson motorbike has sold at auction for a miraculous £200,000 - 20 times its original valuation. Dozens of potential buyers attended the auction at the Grand Palais (Great Palace) in Paris, all of them hoping to get their hands on the 1,585cc Dyna Super Glide. It was given to Pope Francis last June as a gift from Harley-Davidson to mark the American company's 110th anniversary.

"World leaders were today urged to focus on growth more than budget cuts this year as fears deepened that recession in Europe will slow the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts global growth of 3.25 per cent in 2012, slower than the 4 per cent it projected in September. In turn, the 17 nations that share the euro will shrink 0.5 per cent this year, compared to its forecast for 1.1 per cent growth four months ago. Grim outlook: British Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Denmark's Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager (right) at a meeting where they rejected an offer from Greece's creditors to help restructure its debts . Europe's recession should only have a modest impact on the United States, which the IMF believes will grow by 1.8 per cent growth over the same period, unchanged from its September estimate. But the global-lending organisation warns against steep budget cuts, which it says will slow growth further and undermine market confidence, running against the push for budget cuts advocated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It comes as the single currency fell back from three-week highs and world stocks stumbled today as the latest setback in efforts to restructure Greek debt triggered more worries about the outlook for the region. Oil prices also fell as investors focused on the chances of a Greek debt default that could hit energy demand. Eurozone finance ministers rejected . as insufficient an offer made by private creditors to help restructure . Greece's debts when they met in Brussels today, sending negotiators back . to the drawing board and raising the threat of a disorderly Greek . default. 'It's back to . worrying about whether Greece is heading for a soft, messy or technical . default,' Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global . Capital in New York, said. Welcome break: German Chancellor Angela Merkel makes a face as she reacts to a performance by carnivalists from Bonn in a traditional ceremony today . In the line-up: Angela Merkell talks to dancers after their performance at the Chancellery in Berlin . The euro last traded at $1.2964 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, a fall of 0.49 per cent. In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said that in light of weaker growth European governments should avoid extreme austerity measures such as spending cuts and tax increases. And healthier European countries whose . governments are facing lower interest rates 'should reconsider the . pace' of their short-term budget cuts. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde made a similar argument on Monday during a speech in Berlin. European banks, meanwhile, are cutting back on lending in order to boost their capital reserves, the fund said. That's likely to hammer Central and Eastern European economies this year, which depend heavily on European bank loans. The cutbacks will also slow growth in many Asian economies, the IMF said, where European banks finance a big chunk of the region's exports. Still, the hit to China will be relatively modest - it is forecast to grow 8.2 per cent this year, down from the fund's earlier projection of 9 per cent. U.S. policymakers should take steps to rein in the long-term costs of government health programs and Social Security, the federal public pension system, the IMF said. But those cuts should be phased in over the long-term. Immediate cuts could slow the economy further. No to cuts: The IMF's World Economic Outlook echoed a speech made by its President Christine Lagarde (above) yesterday when she said European governments should avoid extreme austerity measures in light of weaker growth . One reason the IMF expects the U.S. economy to remain sluggish is because governments at all levels will likely cut back on spending. The IMF assumes the Social Security payroll tax and extended unemployment benefits will be extended for the full year. Last month, Congress agreed to extend them only through February. Without a full extension of both measures, the U.S. economy will fare much worse, the IMF said. Lagarde warned yesterday that the world economy faced the risk of a painful recession this year. She called on policymakers to avoid the stalemates that prevented Europe and the United States from resolving difficult budget and economic problems last year. 'It is not about saving any one country or any one region,' she said. 'It is about saving the world from a downward economic spiral.' The IMF's projections followed a similar mark-down in global growth estimates last week by the World Bank.","World economy to grow 3.25% this year, down from earlier forecast, says International Monetary Fund .

"The New Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has accused Vladimir Putin of ‘sponsoring terrorism’ and delivered an ultimatum to Russia’s leader: ‘Get out of Ukraine.’ In the most outspoken response to the crisis from any senior western politician, Mr Fallon said Putin must be taught he cannot get away with ‘egging on’ Russian separatists blamed for the attack. ‘We have to make it very clear if there is any more interference like this – and it turns out he was behind it – there will be repercussions. He has to be clear the West will act.’ Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Michael Fallon has made it clear he won't let Vladimir Putin flex his muscles in Ukraine . Mr Fallon, who was made Defence Secretary in David Cameron’s reshuffle last week, and is known for his robust style, said Russia must not be allowed to grab back countries like Ukraine lost when the Iron Curtain collapsed. He warned Putin: ‘Get out of East Ukraine and leave it to the Ukrainians.’ Mr Fallon’s tough talk was echoed by David Cameron who said last night: ‘If President Putin does not change his approach on Ukraine, then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia. This is not about military action. But it is time to make our power, influence and resources count.’ Mr Fallon also vowed to stop the crisis caused by the airliner shot down over Ukraine turning into World War Three, but said he feared the dispute could spill over into other former Soviet Union nations which have defied Putin. He ruled out sending British soldiers to Ukraine to defend it against Russian backed attacks.  But, significantly, he did not rule out other military assistance from Britain and its NATO allies. The RAF could provide fighter jets, as it already does to protect another part of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic state of Estonia, targeted by Putin, he suggested. And the British Government could punish Russian billionaires with money held in London. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Fallon, 62, said: ‘I don’t think we are at the start of World War Three, but NATO has to respond. It is clearly a threat to NATO’s Eastern flank and that’s why we must offer as much reassurance as we can, particularly to the Baltic States – that is why we have had four (RAF) Typhoons there since May.’ Asked about the risk of a major confrontation between Russia and the West, he said: ‘That is what we are working very hard to avoid.’ Operation: Rescue forces have started retrieve and remove bodies of passengers from the crash site of MH17 . Crash site: Ukrainian rescue workers have been allowed into the site to start collecting bodies of the victims . Members of the Ukrainian Emergency Ministry worked late into the night retrieving bodies in body bags . He said it was ‘extremely worrying’ that the Ukraine flashpoint ‘could spill over elsewhere to Moldova and states in the Caucuses.’ But he dismissed claims there was little the UK could do to stop Putin. ‘If Russia is the principal culprit, we can take further action against them and make it clear this kind of sponsored war is completely unacceptable. It is sponsored terrorism as far as people of East Ukraine are concerned. We don’t know if somebody said “let’s bring down a civil airliner, wherever it’s from,” – but we need to find out.’ Asked if Putin was ‘egging on’ Russian separatists, Mr Fallon replied: ‘Yes. That is the danger that flows from Russian activity on and over the border in the last few months. That’s why he needs to move his troops away from the border and stop interfering. ‘They need to get out of East Ukraine and leave Ukraine to the Ukrainians.’ Asked about claims that the crisis in Ukraine was the result of an attempt by Putin to rebuild the former Communist empire of the Soviet Union, Mr Fallon said: ‘There’s a pattern emerging. We saw what he did in Georgia, we’ve seen now what he’s done in Crimea and we need to respond to that. 'We need to leave Ukraine to the Ukrainians. Putin needs to move his troops from the border and stop interfering' ‘There’s no prospect of us putting boots on the ground in Ukraine, though we can assist with technology, surveillance and technical support.’ But could any British military firepower be involved? ‘We have contributed to the Baltic air policing mission by putting Typhoons into Estonia, and we will certainly do what’s needed for any of our NATO allies in providing reassurance and support.’ And what if Ukraine asked for military help from the UK? ‘That’s for NATO to respond to – I won’t be drawn,’ he said cautiously, in an interview at the Ministry of Defence on Friday. Pressed on whether he would rule it out, Mr Fallon said: ‘We’ve not been asked to put troops on the ground in Ukraine so it’s speculation at the moment.’ However, he added the NATO summit in September ‘will have to think how it offers more reassurance to countries on its borders,’ laying emphasis on the ‘will.’ So ultimately, it must be some kind of military assistance? ‘Yes, but military assistance takes many forms: defence capacity building, technical support, sharing assets.’ As for whether there were any circumstances in which Britain would defend Ukraine from a Russian attack, he went on: ‘I’m not going to speculate. We are facing a different type of warfare, ambiguous warfare where countries like Russia appear to be acting through sponsored groups, vehicles without marking, uniforms without tabs. We need to work out a response to that.’ And what would he say to Putin if he could speak to him face to face? ‘I would say “it is completely unacceptable for a country to be involved in this kind of activity in another sovereign state.” ‘There is plenty of evidence  that financial sanctions are already affecting the Russian economy  and the ability of their bodies to trade through London. There’s a range of other sanctions available, cutting off more links with Russia. He [Putin] needs to trade with the West and relies on the City of London.’ Unlike his predecessor, super- cautious Philip Hammond, surgeon’s son Mr Fallon is known to speak his mind. Downing Street has supported claims pro-Russian separatists were behind the missile that hit MH17 . Married with two children, he first became an MP in 1983. His 21 year ‘journey’ to reach the Cabinet in his 60s flies in the face of claims that the reshuffle was designed to clear out ‘male, pale and stale’ Tories from the Prime Minister’s top table. Clearly, Cameron does not regard Fallon as stale – or he wouldn’t have put him in the defence hot seat, with his finger on Britain’s nuclear button. And as for whether he has he seen nuclear button... ‘I’ve been briefed on the procedures,’ he mutters with an irritated sigh. Fallon’s world-weary, some would say cynical, manner, has led some to mistrust him. He was in Tory exile when Cameron first became leader in 2005, having strongly backed rival candidate David Davis. But his shrewd, hard-headed approach, combined with proving his loyalty in the nine intervening years, persuaded a sceptical Cameron to give him another chance. Fallon is no one dimensional career politician. In a five year spell out of Parliament in the 1990s, he went into business with Duncan Bannatyne, of TV’s ‘Dragon’s Den.’ He has a long standing interest in defence, but no military background. Nor is it clear if he has ever fired a gun. After a long pause, he replied: ‘Not since school.’ In the Army Cadets, I suggest? ‘Yes, probably,’ was his less than emphatic reply.","Michael Fallon accuses Vladimir Putin of 'sponsoring terrorism'

"Prolific: The profile photo of Abu Layth, AKA 20-year-old Anil Khalil Raoufi, on Twitter . Just a few years ago he was a normal western teenager who loved cars and was keen to become a mechanic. But yesterday, former University student Anil Khalil Raoufi, 20, was named as the latest Briton to be killed while fighting with Islamist fanatics in Syria. Neighbours have told how the ‘friendly’ teenager with dreams of becoming a mechanic had been ‘dramatically’ radicalised in just a few years. He dropped out of a mechanical engineering course at Liverpool University, swapped his western clothes for full islamic dress. He even stopped speaking to non-muslim friends if he passed them in the street, they said. Raoufi’s actions are thought to have stunned his family, who raised him in an affluent Manchester suburb near where his father owned a restaurant business. One source said his family did not even know he had travelled to Syria to fight - let alone been killed. Yesterday anti-terrorist police were searching his family’s home after Raoufi was unmasked as the fighter whose nom de guerre was Abu Layth. The 20-year-old was regarded as a key figure in recruiting Britons to fight for Al Qaeda-linked militant groups in Syria until his death earlier this month. Posting on a Twitter account under the name ‘Abu Layth’, he penned a graphic accounts of the country’s brutal civil war online after leaving his home last year. He even referred on Twitter to being caught in a firefight as ‘like a scene from Star Wars’ as bullets ‘zinged’ inches over his head. In one of his online entries, he described al-Qaeda as ‘a beautiful thing’. Search: Counter-terrorist police searched his family's house in the affluent Manchester suburb of Didsbury . The second oldest son of four children, the keen amateur boxer - who only turned 20 earlier this month - had an older brother Naveed, a pharmacist in Manchester, a sister, Naveeda, 22, and a younger brother. The £250,000 three-bedroom semi-detached house in the affluent suburb of Didsbury is a short distance from two restaurants run by his father. A local resident said his mother Kamala was ‘a lovely, lovely woman, completely part of the street’s life, not at all isolated, since the day they arrived’. ‘I’m really shocked,’ she added. His family were in hiding yesterday, but neighbours said that when Raoufi was about 17 he changed from being popular high school student with many non-Muslim friends and a car-obsessed ‘pistonhead’ to an Islamist radical. ‘It was quite dramatic,’ said one. ‘He went from being quite a friendly boy who would say hello in the street to someone who would ignore you. ‘He began wearing long robes and Muslim cap and grew a beard. No-one knew why because his family weren’t really religious at all.’ Warfare: One photo on the former student's Twitter account depicted a fighter dancing on top of a gun-mounted truck . Life as a Syrian fighter: This photo was also posted on the Abu Layth Twitter account . Another said: ‘Growing up, Anil was just like any other lad. He loved his cars and was always talking about them. ‘I think he wanted to become a mechanic and he was studying locally with the aim of taking it up as a career. He swapped and changed his cars a lot - the last one was a silver BMW.’ Workers at nearby Didsbury Mosque said he was not well-known there, and he is understood to have been recruited to become a jihadi in Syria after becoming further radicalised through Internet contact with committed Islamists. He is understood to have travelled to Syria to join another Briton, Iftikhar Jaman, a 23-year-old call centre worker from Portsmouth who was himself later killed fighting with the rebels. Raoufi joined up with the feared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham militant group blamed for many atrocities and is understood to have led a brigade of British fighters, posing for photographs with weaponry including an anti-aircraft gun. Raoufi is understood to have been shot in the head during a clash with a rival rebel group earlier this month. #JihadFitness: One of the messages retweeted by Abu Layth . Terrorism expert Neil Doyle said: ‘He was one of the most visible British fighters in Syria and seems to have played a key role recruiting fellow Islamists who wanted to join extremist groups fighting the Assad regime. ‘But from his postings on Twitter he seems to have been caught up with infighting between different rebel factions and to have achieved very little by way of actually helping the Syrian people.’ Shocked former schoolfriends yesterday posted tributes online. One, Naomi Stark, wrote: ‘RIP Anil, you were always so funny and friendly in high school.’ But Twitter ‘Marvi’ wrote: ‘Upsetting hearing about Anil, he was a real soldier, he did what most of us could not imagine doing. ‘Died whilst protecting others.’ Detective Chief Inspector Will Chatterton, of the North West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said his officers were ‘providing support to the family’ and ‘speaking to them to understand how a man from the North West came to be reportedly killed in Syria’. He urged anyone with information about Britons travelling to Syria to take part in the fighting to contact police.","Former uni student Anil Khalil Raoufi was 'radicalised' in just a few years .

"A mother-of-two killed herself by jumping from a multi-storey car park after suffering years of  crippling pain in her face believed to have been caused by toothache. Janette Warburton, 58, was in agony and struggled to eat or sleep but her  problem was never fully diagnosed, an inquest heard today. On March 29 this year she drove to Blackpool with her husband David to see a dentist because experts believed her pain was caused by a cracked filling. In pain: Janette Warburton, 58, jumped off a car park after suffering crippling, undiagnosed, pain in her mouth and face for up to five years . However, the inquest heard how Mrs Warburton then told her husband she felt too unwell to attend the appointment and so he went into the surgery to explain. But while he was away she threw herself from the fifth storey of the town's Talbot Road car park. Parking warden Craig Walker told her inquest how he saw the 58-year-old climbing a barrier and yelled 'come back' but she replied: 'I'm going' and jumped to her death. After her death, her sister Carol Clements, 61, found she had researched how to kill herself online. She said: 'The pain in her face first started around five years ago. She wasn't sure what it was but thought it was maybe because she'd had so many teeth removed'. Mrs Clements said in December last year the pain became unbearable. She said: 'Janette was in Tenerife and she bit down on something hard and it really set the pain off. 'This pain was worse than she'd ever felt before and she didn't sleep for weeks. 'She couldn't eat and she stopped going out because she couldn't cope with the pain. 'Around that time, she started talking about suicide and we didn't know at the time but she'd been researching it on the internet. 'By the end, she was sleeping just an hour each night and she said she felt like her body was shutting down. 'Janette was loved by everyone and her two children were devoted to her. Couple: Mrs Warburton told her husband David (pictured together) to run in to the dentist to cancel an appointment before jumping to her death. Mr Warburton says his wife was failed . Much loved: Mrs Warburton with her first grandchild Sawyer. She herself had two children . 'Her friends were just as upset as myself and my three children. There is a huge hole in my life'. Her husband believes his wife had not received the help she needed, and said her condition meant she should not have been discharged from Royal Preston Hospital ten days before her death. Psychiatrist Gillian Strachan said Mrs Warburton had received visits from the Lancashire Care Trust's crisis team, amid concerns about her mental health. But she cancelled the visits following her discharge from hospital having resisted seeing a psychologist. Dr Strachan said that while Mrs Warburton had been depressed she had denied having any intention of suicide. But two notes written by Mrs Warburton were found at her home, including one talking about not wanting to live any more. Mrs Warburton climbed to the fifth storey of Blackpool's Talbot Road car park (above) and jumped to her death . Blackpool and Fylde coroner, Alan Wilson, accepted that Mrs Warburton had intended to take her own life and the post-mortem conclusion that she had died from multiple injuries following a fall. He said there was no evidence of any 'gross failing' in her care and that she had not met criteria to be sectioned. Her daughter Shelley Jacobs, who lives in Leicestershire and did not attend the hearing, said afterwards: 'Mum was vibrant, with a real sense of humour. She loved to travel and make cocktails. 'It's tragic that my seven-month old son Sawyer, her first grandchild, will not know his nana'.

"His form alongside Martin Skrtel and Emre Can has turned Liverpool's defence into one of the meanest in the Premier League since Christmas. But Mamadou Sakho has shown his softer side by volunteering to help out a local charity in Bootle restore a house. The France defender exchanged the red of Liverpool's kit for builder's whites as he assisted two charities, An Hour For Others and Progressive Lifestyle Solutions, with some handiwork, as well as donating a shirt to be auctioned off for the cause.

Sakho wrote on a shirt handed to the builders 'Pour (for) A.H.F.D, keep up the good work, Y.N.W.A (You'll Never Walk Alone), Sakho.' The cause itself looks to see people donate time rather than money to help others out and Sakho was clearly impressed with the sense of community. He made contact with the charity himself after seeing them on the internet and helped them for a couple of hours, before going to the local shop buy some treats for those who he had helped with the decorating. Sakho went and bought some treats for the people he had been working with from a nearby shop . Sakho's next appearance for Liverpool could come on Saturday, when his team take on Crystal Palace in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

"People who obsessively take pictures of what they are eating or cooking and post them online may be ill, according to a leading expert. Foodstagramming is a trend which involves taking pictures of your food and posting it on Instagram and Twitter. The craze has become so popular that . some restaurants have stopped customers from taking photos of their . meals because the flashes and manoeuvrings of food disrupts other . diners. Craze: A recent 'foodstagram' shows a person's birthday cake which they couldn't resist eating before taking a picture . In January, Michelin-starred New York chef David Bouley banned customera who foodstagrammed in his restaurant. But Dr Valerie Taylor, chief of psychiatry at Women's College Hospital at the University of Toronto, argues that religiously documenting each meal might not only be annoying but the sign of a more sinister problem too. 'I see clients for whom food has become problematic, and they struggle to go out and not have food be the key element of all social interaction: what they eat, when they ate, when they are going to eat again,' Dr Taylor told The Huffington Post. Dr Taylor gave a talk at the Canadian Obesity Summit in Vancouver last week about eating disorders and the role that food plays in modern society and culture. ‘The concern becomes when all they do is send pictures of food,’ she added. Fast foodstagramming: The trend is even leading people to document the more mundane food they consume . ‘We take pictures of things that are important to us, and for some people, the food itself becomes central and the rest -– the venue, the company, et cetera -- is background.' While Taylor argues that producing such images may signal an unhealthy preoccupation with food and in turn an eating disorder, others have linked the consumption of food photography to weight gain. Many have blamed the West's obsessive preoccupation with food - dubbing books, programmes, fashionable foods as 'food porn' -  for their bulging waistlines. A 2012 study carried out by the University of Southern California found that spending a lot of time looking at appetising food online stimulated the brain and causes people to eat too much.","Dr Valerie Taylor said people who document what they eat online may have unhealthy relationship with food .

"A British Muslim who knew one of Fusilier Lee Rigby’s murderers today admitted posting sick videos on YouTube glorifying the killing and mocking tributes left at the murder scene. Royal Barnes, 23, and his wife Rebekah Dawson, 22, recorded and uploaded three videos shortly after the murder in Woolwich, south London, in May 2013. In one of the videos posted under his . account Musa Real Talks, Barnes hailed the murder as a 'brilliant day' and in a follow-up he mocked the outpouring of public grief, laughing . uncontrollably as he drove past floral tributes. Scroll down for video . Couple: Royal Barnes, 23, (left) and his wife Rebekah Dawson, 22, (right) recorded and uploaded three sick videos on YouTube glorifying the killing of Lee Rigby and mocking tributes left at the murder scene . Barnes, . who knew one of the murderers, Michael Adebowale, also posted on . Facebook the offer of a reward for avenging the rape of an Iraqi woman. None of his 500 friends replied. The post on June 12, 2013, stated: 'Any1 . who kills an invading soldier in Muslim land I will give them a Vauxhall . Astra 3door and money (French British American any kaffir soldier take . ur pick).' Barnes, of Hackney, east London, today pleaded guilty to three counts of disseminating a terrorist publication and one of inciting murder during a hearing at the Old Bailey. His wife, who had insisted on wearing her veil in court, had already admitted disseminating a terrorist publication at a previous hearing and is awaiting sentence. Victim: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was killed in May last year . Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, will be sentenced later this month after they were found guilty of murdering Fusilier Rigby. The British Muslim converts ran the soldier down in a car before hacking him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack. They then dumped his body in the middle of the road near Woolwich Barracks. Naeem Mian, defending Barnes, said: 'Mr Barnes makes three postings on YouTube immediately after the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby which are to say the very least untasteful. 'About a month or so later Mr Barnes posted on Facebook following on from a posting which details the rape of an Iraqi woman, saying he would reward anybody who murders an allied soldier with a Vauxhall Astra.' Video nasty: The court was then shown all three videos and some other examples of earlier videos that Barnes had posted on YouTube, which were found in a police search of his home . Anger: The second video shows Dawson in a face veil behind a title: 'British troops kill Muslims so they will die on London streets' Laughing: One video shows Barnes being filmed by his wife driving past the scene of the Woolwich murder to a loud musical soundtrack. They are heard to laugh repeatedly as they take in the floral tributes to the murdered soldier lining the street . Prosecuting, Kate Wilkinson told the court that before the postings, Barnes had been involved with a Sharia Law patrol of London streets, ordering women in short shirts to cover up and telling people to stop drinking alcohol. He was also a member of extremist group Al-Muhajiroun - or Muslims Against Crusades - taking part in demonstrations advocating Sharia Law in the UK, including one on December 24, 2012, outside St Paul’s Cathedral with Adebowale. The court was then shown all three videos and some other examples of earlier videos that Barnes had posted on YouTube, which were found in a police search of his home. The first video includes a clip of one of the Woolwich murderers talking with a knife in his hand in front of Fusilier Rigby’s body. Controversy: Dawson hit the headlines when she was allowed to wear a full-face veil in the dock during a seven-day trial for witness intimidation at Blackfriars Crown Court . What follows is an on camera diatribe by Barnes filmed by his wife Dawson. The whole video goes on for seven and a half minutes. In it, he described the murder as a 'brilliant day' and warns Prime Minister David Cameron and the British public that the attack will not be the last. He says: 'You are not safe here, do you understand? British soldiers, you are not safe on the streets of London.' The second video shows Dawson in a face veil behind a title: 'British troops kill Muslims so they will die on London streets.' She is then heard to say: 'Obviously now this guy who has been killed, Joe Blogg’s or whatever his name is, was killed, this is the lion, the tiger fighting back...We are fighting back and Sharia, obviously the Islamic law, will dominate the entire world....don’t worry, it is coming Inshallah (God willing).' Michael Adebolajo, 29, (right) and Michael Adebowale (right), 22, will be sentenced later this month after they were found guilty of murdering Fusilier Rigby . Attack: British Muslim converts Adebowale (left) and Adebolajo (right) ran the soldier down in a car before hacking him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack . The third video shows Barnes being filmed by his wife driving past the scene of the Woolwich murder to a loud musical soundtrack. They are heard to laugh repeatedly as they take in the floral tributes to the murdered soldier lining the street. As Dawson asks him to drive around again, Barnes says: 'Now they turn it into a shrine where they are worshipping his flippin’ shrine....Obviously the death of Lee Rigby is something to be ridiculed at, because these kuffar, they fail to realise that their foreign policy is the reason why this Lee Rigby is no more (hysterical laughing)...he got chopped up in Woolwich..' The first and second films were only on YouTube for two to three days, while the third remained online for two weeks. Only the first video was removed by YouTube itself. Another video clip retrieved by police showed Barnes at Finsbury Park Tube station pretending to be a suicide bomber on the platform in front of other passengers. The court was shown a further video of Barnes secretly filmed in the dock at Westminster Magistrates’ Court being sentenced for a public order offence after an English Defence League demonstration. Mocked: Barnes made fun of the flowers left at the scene of Fusilier Rigby's death . Tribute: Musician Dan Griffiths, 22, plays the Last Post at  a memorial service for Drummer Lee Rigby at the Woolwich Barracks . In memory: Thousands of floral tributes were left in honour of the soldier . In memory: Thousands of floral tributes were left in honour of the soldier . Outside the court, he is seen on camera mocking British justice, and bragging he is 'free as a bird'. The last video shown in court was of a vigilante-style Sharia Muslim patrol in east London. Barnes covers his face in a scarf to rant about Sharia Law on the streets before a clip of a drunken man falling asleep at a bus stop with sound effects of guns being cocked. Barnes, wearing a tunic, trainers and scarf, spoke in a clear voice in the dock as he entered his guilty pleas. The judge Brian Barker adjourned sentencing to a date to be fixed while reports are carried out. He told Barnes it was in his interests to co-operate with the reports, to which Barnes replied 'undoubtedly'. It can now be reported that Barnes, along with fellow members of the Sharia street patrols, was convicted in November last year of using threatening and abusive words and behaviour towards members of the public. And Dawson’s guilty plea could only be reported after her husband admitted the offences today. Despite that, Dawson hit the headlines when she was allowed to wear a full-face veil in the dock. During a seven-day trial for witness intimidation at Blackfriars Crown Court, the Muslim convert was allowed to wear a niqab that showed just her eyes. She declined to give evidence because she would have had to show her face to the jury. After the jury was discharged, she dramatically changed her plea and admitted that offence last month. After today’s hearing, Commander Richard Walton, head of the Counter Terrorism Command (SO15), said: 'Fusilier Rigby’s murder in Woolwich last year shocked the nation. We will target and prosecute anyone who glorifies and encourages terrorism in this way. To do so is an act of terrorism itself.'","Royal Barnes, 23, and his wife Rebekah Dawson, 22, uploaded three videos .

"One in three Americans can't name a single branch of the United States government, an embarrassing, new poll has found. Executive, legislative or judicial would all suffice, but a surprising 35 percent of Americans were stumped by the basic civics question, the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, revealed on Wednesday. A mere 36 percent of Americans were able to name all three, pollsters discovered. Survey-takers were even more unlikely to be able to answer other, albeit less rudimentary, questions about the United States government, including what political party controls the upper and lower chambers of Congress and how many votes it takes to overturn a presidential veto. Do you know which branch of the government operates out of this room? If you don't, you're not alone. A new poll found that a mere 36 percent of Americans could name all three branches of government. (HINT: The people pictured here are Members of Congress) Most Americans also weren't aware that the Republican Party, led by Ohio Rep. John Boehner, control the House of Representatives . The Senate is controlled by the Democratic Party. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, left, is pictured here with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, right, during a rare joint session of Congress this morning . The Republican Party controls the House of Representatives, but only 38 percent of Americans surveyed were aware of that. Half as many, 17 percent, thought that Democrats ruled the roost. Meanwhile, a plurality of Americans, 44 percent, admitted they had no idea who holds a majority of seats in the House. Most Americans were also confused about which party runs the Senate, with 38 percent correctly identifying the Democratic Party as the political group in power. Another 20 percent thought Republicans were in charge of the Senate while 42 percent claimed ignorance. Asked about the procedure for overturning a presidential veto, less than a third of respondents accurately argued that it takes a two-thirds majority vote by both the House and the Senate to overrule the nation's leader. One in five survey-takers were woefully under-educated about how checks and balances work, as well. Poll-takers found that 21 percent of Americans think a 5-4 Supreme Court decision goes back to Congress. Though the poll was taken in mid-July, it was only just released this Thursday, which was federally recognized as Constitution Day in America. 'Although surveys reflect disapproval of the way Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court are conducting their affairs, the Annenberg survey demonstrates that many know surprisingly little about these branches of government,' Annenberg Public Policy Center Director Kathleen Hall Jamieson said in a statement accompanying the results of the poll. 'This survey offers dramatic evidence of the need for more and better civics education,' Jamieson said. The frightening outcome of the civics test inspired APPC to join 25 other non-profit organizations, including the Library of Congress and the National Archives, in creating the Civic Renewal Network.","Executive, legislative or judicial would all suffice, but a surprising 35 percent of Americans were stumped by the basic civics question .

"‘Chapter one…he adored New York City’. So goes the opening line of Woody Allen’s cult hit, Manhattan. But despite the film's reputation as a classic ode to New York, the grittier neighbourhoods of Brooklyn clearly weren't on the auteur's radar when he penned his masterpiece a quarter of a century ago. Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg is at the centre of the Brooklyn revolution, which has seen an influx of young urbanites, fashionistas and bearded hipsters relocating to the borough . Sex and the City might have provided a sugar-coated view of the city during the 1990s. But the thought of one of the fashion-obsessed singletons living amongst the industrialised suburbs was enough to make Carrie Bradshaw choke on her cosmopolitan. Not anymore. The once run-down borough, for so long a destination solely to be passed through to get from Manhattan to JFK Airport, now caters for the young urbanites, fashionistas as well as bearded hipsters who have been priced out of the city. It is also home to a fair few celebrities who have followed the middle-classes, with Anne Hathaway, Lena Dunham and British actor Patrick Stewart all residents of the borough. Even Sarah Jessica Parker herself is said to be house hunting in the area. So, despite being well behind the times, I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about and join the crowds flocking over the East River for a dose of shabby-chic glamour, foodie heaven and cutting edge bars. One of the most spectacular views of the New York skyline is offered by the McCarren Hotel & Pool – a vibrant, boutique establishment set in the heart of Williamsburg . Sheltering Sky, the Moroccan-themed rooftop lounge set on the hotel’s eighth floor, is open all year round and allows guests to enjoy one of the most breath-taking views of Manhattan . The Art Deco-inspired pool at the McCarren hotel has been described as the ‘ultimate urban retreat’ Williamsburg is the neighbourhood leading the borough's meteoric revolution, and thankfully for all the Manhattanites they don't have to stray too far from their spiritual home to get there. Just one stop on the subway from New York's Lower East Side, the lively Bedford Avenue is at the epicentre of the area's transformation from a tough inner-city neighbourhood to Bohemian paradise. While you might not find a Manolo Blahnik boutique here just yet, you could probably pick up a second-hand pair from the myriad of vintage stores and flea markets springing up inside former factory buildings and derelict warehouses. Renowned clothes store Beacon’s Closet in nearby Greenpoint is a must for fashion enthusiasts, while the weekend-only indoor market Artists and Fleas provides the perfect introduction to the growing collection of Boho locals selling handmade arts and craft items, jewellery and retro clothing. There is no doubting the buzz around Williamsburg, now referred to by locals as simply The ‘Burg . And if the wealth of cocktail bars lining the streets of Williamsburg isn't enough to tempt Manhattanites over the river, then the rooftop bars and boutique hotels certainly will be. One of the most spectacular views of New York's skyline is offered by the McCarren Hotel & Pool – a vibrant, boutique establishment set slap-bang in the heart of the action. Sheltering Sky, the Moroccan-themed, rooftop lounge set on the hotel’s eighth floor, is open all year round and allows guests to enjoy one of the most breath-taking panoramic views back over the East River towards the city. The hotel's location provided the perfect base for bar-hopping during our week-long trip, and ringing in the New Year at this intimate bar was among the highlights of our visit. I’m told this 64-room hotel has thrown some legendary parties, attracting A-list guests such as Jude Law, while the hotel’s Art Deco-inspired pool area has been described as the ‘ultimate urban retreat’. Brooklyn's illustrious brewing heritage has  been revived following the introduction of the Brooklyn Brewery in 1988. It has become such a staple part of Brooklyn life that it now offers free tours of its premises . Despite the rapid gentrification that has transformed Brooklyn, there is still a nod to the area’s rich history. Before prohibition, the borough boasted 48 breweries and its illustrious heritage has more recently been revived following the introduction of the Brooklyn Brewery in 1988. The brewery, which supplies many of the alehouses and craft beer bars in Brooklyn, has become such an integral part of the area's transformation that it now even offers free tours. If any better evidence were needed of the area’s change in fortunes it comes from the brewery’s owners, who proudly declare: ‘It used to be that we'd be lucky to cobble together 15 brave souls to visit the wilds of Williamsburg on a Saturday afternoon. ‘Now we're happy to report that the brewery hosts a bustling crowd of beer enthusiasts, neighbours, tourists and all sorts of thirsty people all week long.’ Brooklyn's Artists and Fleas vintage market is open at weekends and sells jewellery, retro clothing and hand-made arts and crafts . The Artists and Fleas market at 70 North 7th Street is one of many vintage retailers springing up around Brooklyn . Yes, I know I’m slightly late to the Brooklyn party. But such is the rapid transformation of the area, that when I last visited New York City  three years ago, the borough wasn't yet considered worthy of making it on to the itinerary. Typically, by the time it established itself on the tourist map the trendsetters were already championing the neighbouring borough of Queens as New York’s latest hotspot. But there’s no doubting the buzz around Williamsburg, now referred to by locals as simply The ‘Burg. Brooklyn's lively Bedford Avenue is situated just one stop away from Manhattan's Lower East Side - or a 10-minute taxi ride over the East River . Brooklyn's restaurant of the moment is undoubtedly Roberta’s pizza parlour, situated in the shadow of the borough's former factories and warehouses . Roberta's doesn't offer reservations and diners are frequently queuing around the block to be seated . Artisan coffee shops, organic stores and flea markets have now taken the place of old factory buildings in Brooklyn . David Beckham and rapper Jay Z have already pledged their allegiance to the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, snubbing Manhattan rivals the New York Knicks. The pair are regularly seen in the crowd at the nearby Barclays Centre arena in Boerum Hill. Perhaps most importantly, the local food scene in Brooklyn has exploded and now ranges from the three Michelin-starred Brooklyn Fare, to experimental Japanese kitchen Okonomi, a miniature 380sq-ft foot diner hidden among the backstreets. The rather unconventional brunch menu of seafood and ramen dishes served at its four-stool counter might not be to the taste of those who hanker after traditional New York fare offered up by the local delis, cafes and bagel shops. But for those who like their food piled high, Sweet Chick offers classic soul food such as fried chicken, waffles and maple syrup and shrimp and grits. The local food scene has exploded, and now includes experimental Japanese kitchen Okonomi, a backstreet Asian diner serving an rather unconventional brunch menu  at its four-stool counter . Brooklyn is mostly low-rise buildings, and has a much more residential, small-town feel compared to the towering skyline and fierce pace of Manhattan . However, Brooklyn's restaurant of the moment is undoubtedly Roberta’s pizza parlour. Set among the industrial parks and abandoned warehouses of east Williamsburg, naturally this hipster hangout is far too cool to offer reservations. Instead, diners queuing patiently around the block is a common sight at weekends. Arcade games from the 1980s have been installed at Barcade, while artisan coffee shops, upmarket delis, fromageries and second-hand book stores are now in plentiful supply. Brooklyn is mostly low-rise buildings, and has a much more residential, small town feel compared to the towering skyline and fierce pace of Manhattan.

"When a man in breach of his restraining order gave police the slip on foot through the dark streets of Birmingham, he probably fancied his chances of getting away. What he hadn't banked on was coming up against marathon running policewoman PC Hannah Graham. The 31-year-old, seven years his senior, pursued the man for over half a mile just after 11pm on New Year's Eve before he ran out of breath and gave up. Marathon runner PC Hannah Graham arrested a man in breach of his restraining order after a half mile chase through the streets of Birmingham on New Year's Eve . PC Hannah Graham, a keen . runner with London and Edinburgh Marathon medals to her name . The 24-year-old man was spotted loitering in the garden of his former partner's home in Birmingham just after 11pm on New Year's Eve. Using a 'bleep' alarm the woman alerted officers patrolling nearby . in dedicated Domestic Abuse Response Vehicles as part of West Midlands Police's . campaign to protect victims. As officers closed in, the man fled but PC Hannah Graham, a keen . runner with London and Edinburgh Marathon medals to her name, chased . him down and helped make an arrest. PC Graham, whose best marathon time is three hours and 55 minutes, said: 'Initially he was hiding in the back garden but then bolted when he spotted our torch lights. 'I chased him along three streets before he gave up, we'd . only been running for about half a mile, though it was more of a sprint rather . than marathon pace. 'He was quick but he burnt out quickly because he didn't have . the stamina. He gave up but I didn't. 'I'm in training for the Loch Ness Marathon later this year . though so it's all good training. 'I train three or four times a week and I take fitness . training really seriously. PC Hannah Graham is training for the Loch Ness Marathon later this year so considered the chase good practise . The man was later charged with two counts of harassment. Inspector . Kim Madill from West Midlands Police’s Public Protection Unit said: . 'The dedicated domestic abuse patrol cars were available across the . region and meant we were able to respond swiftly to any incidents. 'We were able to offer support and advice to many sufferers and made several arrests. 'The . campaign focused on the festive period but, of course, people shouldn’t . tolerate domestic abuse at any time of year. Domestic abuse can be . emotional, psychological, sexual, financial or physical; we want . sufferers to know help is only a phone-call away – police can take swift . action to protect them and their family and, through support groups . like Women’s Aid, victims can take positive action to turn their life . around.'","24-year-old was found loitering in an ex-partner's garden and ran off .

"Looking at these pictures it is perhaps unsurprising that a new Pope has been elected. Thanks to a rare phenomenon the blazing sun has been pictured over Tibet looking as if it is wearing a halo. The bizarre bright ring also makes it look like as though a huge eye is in the sky. Also known as a 'sundog', a solar halo is a distant cousin of a rainbow caused by sunlight shining through a thin layer of cloud called Cirrostratus, which is made up of millions of tiny ice crystals. Angelic: This incredible halo around the Sun was captured by a Russian photographer as she travelled across the Tibetan desert . The thin cloud cover is up anywhere about 9km above sea level where the temperature is between minus 30C and minus 35C. The spectacular images were taken by Russian photographer Elena Belozorova who spotted the extraordinary sight while driving to Darchen city.

"U.S. warplanes wiped out Islamic State insurgents menacing Iraq's Haditha Dam with five air strikes that widened what Barack Obama called a campaign to ultimately defeat the jihadist movement. Obama has branded Islamic State an acute threat to the West as well as the Middle East and said that key NATO allies stood ready to back Washington in action against the well-armed sectarian force. The leader of a pro-Iraqi government paramilitary force in western Iraq said the air strikes destroyed an Islamic State patrol trying to attack the dam - Iraq's second biggest hydroelectric facility that also provides millions with water. 'They (the air strikes) were very accurate. There was no collateral damage... If Islamic State had gained control of the dam, many areas of Iraq would have been seriously threatened, even (the capital) Baghdad,' Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha told Reuters. Scroll down for video . Location: U.S. warplanes have launched five air strikes on Islamic State militants trying to capture Haditha Dam . Key target: Haditha dam (above) is Iraq's second biggest hydroelectric facility that provides millions with water . The aerial assault drove Islamic State fighters away from the dam, according to a police intelligence officer in the vast western province of Anbar, a hotbed of Islamist insurgency. The U.S. military said in a statement that the strikes destroyed four IS Humvees, four IS armed vehicles, two of which were carrying anti-aircraft artillery, an IS fighting position, one IS command post and an IS defensive fighting position. All aircraft left the strike areas safely, the Pentagon said. The strikes were Washington's first reported offensive into Anbar since it started attacks on Islamic State forces in the north of Iraq in August. Almost three years after U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq and 11 years after their invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, the war on Islamic State is drawing Washington back into the middle of Iraq's power struggles and bloody sectarian strife. Defence: . Kurdish peshmerga fighters take up position as their tanks (not . pictured) shell Islamic State controlled areas at the Khazir front line . leading to Mosul . Strategy: . Islamic State fighters were able to take control of the Mosul Dam . (pictured) in northern Iraq last month, but persistent U.S. airstrikes . later dislodged the militants . The head of the Arab League has urged its members to confront Islamic State extremists 'militarily and politically'. The apparent call to arms came as President Barack Obama prepares to go to politicians and the American public with his own plan to stop the militants. Backing from the 22-country Arab League could provide crucial support across the Middle East for Mr Obama's effort to assemble an international coalition against IS, which has conquered large parts of Iraq and Syria. Nato forces have already agreed to take on the extremists. Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said what is needed from Arab countries is a 'clear and firm decision for a comprehensive confrontation' with 'cancerous and terrorist' groups. The Arab League includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel . said the strikes on the Sunni Muslim insurgents had been carried out at . the request of the Shi'ite Muslim-led central government in Baghdad. 'If . that dam would fall into (Islamic State's) hands or if that dam would . be destroyed, the damage that would cause would be very significant and . it would put a significant, additional and big risk into the mix in . Iraq,' Hagel told reporters during a trip to Georgia's capital, Tbilisi. Obama said on the weekend he would explain to Americans this week his plan to 'start going on some offense' against Islamic State. 'We are going to be a part of an international coalition, carrying out air strikes in support of work on the ground by Iraqi troops, Kurdish troops,' he said in an NBC TV interview. 'We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities. We're going to shrink the territory that they control. And ultimately we're going to defeat 'em.' The six-month-old battle for control of the Haditha Dam has been a rare case of co-operation between local Sunni tribes and the Shi'ite-led Iraqi military. The Juhayfa tribe in Haditha has a long-standing fight with the Islamic State, which split with its parent organization Al Qaeda last year. Anbar is complicated terrain for the . Americans as they seek to root out Islamic State, since Sunnis fighting . on behalf of the Baghdad government are the exception to the rule. Summit: . US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (left) with President Barack Obama and . UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the NATO summit in Wales last week . Islamic State fighters appear to be using captured U.S. military-issue arms and weapons supplied to moderate rebels in Syria by Saudi Arabia, according to a report published today. The study by the London-based small-arms research organisation Conflict Armament Research documented weapons seized by Kurdish forces from militants in Iraq and Syria over a 10-day period in July. The report said the jihadists disposed of 'significant quantities' of U.S.-made small arms including M16 assault rifles and included photos showing the markings 'Property of US Govt'. It also found that anti-tank rockets used by IS in Syria were 'identical to M79 rockets transferred by Saudi Arabia to forces operating under the Free Syrian Army umbrella in 2013'. The rockets were made in the then Yugoslavia in the 1980s. Islamic State is believed to have seized large quantities of weapons from Syrian military installations it has captured as well as arms supplied by the United States to the Iraqi army after it swept through northern Iraq in recent weeks. The . large desert province, bordering Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, has . been at war with Baghdad since last December when then-Prime Minister . Nuri al-Maliki sent troops to raze an anti-government demonstrators' camp. That sparked a tribal revolt against Maliki whom Sunnis accused of isolating them with indiscriminate arrests. Islamic State fighters took advantage of the chaos to muscle in and become the dominant force among Sunnis. The fighting there, which has displaced 430,000 people since January, strengthened Islamic State ahead of its lightning blitz this summer across the north of Iraq, also threatening the semi-autonomous, Western-backed enclave of Kurdistan. Thriving on Maliki's sectarian-motivated alienation of Sunnis, Islamic State committed wide-scale atrocities against Shi'ites, Christians and other non-Sunnis this summer as the Iraqi army imploded in the face of the insurgents' advance. Since June, Islamic State has massacred hundreds of soldiers outside of Saddam's hometown, Tikrit, after capturing it, and killed a similar number of Yazidis and other religious minorities outside of Mosul, the north's biggest city. Obama ordered air strikes in northern Iraq last month as Kurdish-controlled territory fell to the Islamic State and the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan looked in endangered. Last weekend, U.S. warplanes carried out raids farther south in the province of Saluhuddin to break an Islamic State siege of the Shi'ite Turkmen town of Amerli.","U.S. warplanes carried out five air strikes on militants near Haditha Dam .

More details about the alleged victim are being circulated on social media but MailOnline has been unable to verify them and has decided not to publish them. In her report Kelly said: ‘Washington's sudden departure from the club was due to impending legal issues stemming from an alleged sexual assault of a reporter.’ She cited a ‘a source with knowledge of the situation’ but did not elaborate further in the short post. MailOnline understands that there are only a handful of female reporters who cover the Rangers full time. A spokeswoman for the North Texas District Attorney’s office, which covers the Dallas Fort Worth area, said she was ‘not aware’ of any investigation. However the victim may not yet have come forward and spoken to police, meaning that prosecutors would not have spoken to her yet. Kelly did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Texas Rangers manager Ron Washington broke his silence after abruptly resigning from the team  two weeks ago by admitting he was unfaithful to his wife. Washington. who attended a Dallas news conference with his wife Gerry at his side, said: 'I was not true to my wife after 42 years. I broke her trust. I'm here today to own that mistake and apologize to her and those I disappointed.' It was the 62-year-old's first public comment since abruptly resigning 13 days earlier.

'This matter is certainly personal, and we're trying hard to put it behind us,' said Washington. 'I was born to be a baseball player; I'm a baseball lifer.

I look to the future and getting back in the game and continuing my career.' They left without taking questions, with Washington putting his right hand on his wife's shoulder as they departed through a back door. His resignation earlier this month took effect immediately, with bench coach Tim Bogar stepping up as interim manager for the remainder of the season. The New Orleans native had previously tested positive for cocaine during the 2009 season, and been subjected to random drug testing ever since, with then-team president Nolan Ryan deciding to keep him on as manager, even as he offered to leave the team. He said at the time in a statement: 'I have submitted my resignation from the job I love - managing the Rangers - in order to devote my full attention to addressing an off-the-field personal matter.' Last place: The Rangers were the first MLB team officially eliminated from making the playoffs . Washington coached the Rangers to appearances in two World Series, in 2010 and 2011 .

"Admission: Tony Barrett called a TV station newsroom saying he killed his wife . A Washington man was apprehended after he called a TV newsroom and declared that he had just killed his wife, then asked the station to broadcast the news on their Facebook page. Tony Barrett, 41, was arrested early Thursday after a high-speed chase that reached 100 mph from Tacoma to Gig Harbor, where police and state troopers stopped his car with spike strips, authorities said. 'I just killed my wife... I want you to put it on your Facebook,' Barrett told  KOMO in a phone call late Wednesday night. 'It was supposed to be `til death do us part, but she wouldn't...' His wife and mother of their three sons, 42-year-old Sara Barrett, was found dead from 'homicidal violence' around 6 a.m. THursday at a Tacoma motel, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. The discovery came just hours after Barrett, who has a history of violence against his wife, was arrested around 2:30 a.m. 'He got out swinging a crowbar' at officers who used a police dog to take him down, Troyer said. He was treated at a hospital for dog bites on the way to jail and held for investigation of murder. Barrett had called the station because he didn't have a Facebook page and wanted the station to post the message, Troyer said. The caller did not say where the woman could be found. The assignment desk asked if there was someone they could notify, and the caller said, 'No, I'm not going to be here much longer.' He said he and his wife had been together 28 years. He disconnected the call when they mentioned police. Tragedy: The couple had been married for 28 years, according to Tony Barrett (right) 'Very odd,' Troyer said. 'That was a full-blown confession to place on Facebook.' Concerned for the wife, the station worked with the sheriff's office. Investigators were able to identify the man, his wife and their cars. Authorities said Barrett's car was spotted around 2:30 a.m. Thursday in Tacoma and he sped away over Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with police and troopers in pursuit until his tires were flattened and he was arrested. He wouldn't talk to officers about his wife. The investigation led detectives to the body at the motel, where the couple had checked in Wednesday evening, Troyer said. 'We were hoping to find her' alive, Troyer said. 'But obviously it didn't work that way.' The couple was estranged and investigators did not know what led to the killing, Troyer said. Court records show Barrett had attacked his wife in 2007, holding a pillow over her face until she nearly suffocated, the station reported. The couple's grown son broke down the bedroom door and stopped the attack. Barrett pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and served a day in jail and two years under supervision by the Department of Corrections. He pleaded guilty to to third-degree assault and served one day in jail. He was also ordered not to have any hostile contact with Sara Barrett for five years. That order expired on Feb. 25. Sara Barrett had filed for protection orders against her husband in 2009 and again in 2012, but she failed to show up for court so they were denied. In the second petition, she said her husband had followed her to her car after work one day and forced her into his car at knifepoint so they could talk. 'He has said that he will never let me go,' she wrote in the petition. 'I am afraid for my life when it comes to him.' Barrett works as a delivery driver for the Tacoma School District’s purchasing department, delivering food, school and office supplies to various campuses. He began working there in July 2001 and is currently on a two-week vacation, district spokesman Dan Voelpel said.","Tony Barrett, 41, was arrested early Thursday after a high-speed chase .

"Israeli diplomats were yesterday targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were blamed on Iran. A bomb attached magnetically to a car in the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli official and two bystanders. Officials in Georgia said an explosive device was attached to the bottom of a diplomat’s car in the capital Tbilisi, but was found and defused before it detonated. Fireball: The Bangkok blasts came the day after Israeli diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also blamed on Iran. A bomb attached magnetically to a car in the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli official and two bystanders . Rescue: Bystanders helped an injured person from the burning car after the bomb exploded infront of them . Closer examination: Indian security and forensic officials examine the car on Monday - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately blamed Iran for the attacks . Daylight explosion: The explosion took place in the late afternoon close to the embassy. An eyewitness told local media he had seen the car being followed by a young man on motorbike, who attached a device to the car before it exploded. Inspection: Personnel believed to be from the Israeli Embassy, right, inspect the site after an explosion . Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu . said Iran was behind both incidents, adding that the Islamic republic’s . Lebanese ally Hezbollah – which battled Israel in a month-long war in . 2006 – could have been involved too. Iranian officials last night denied the claims as ‘sheer lies’. If Iran were involved, the plots . would represent a new threat of Israelis being targeted across the . world. Tehran has been accused of developing a nuclear weapons programme . and Israel says such a project would be a threat to the Jewish state. Comments by Israeli officials have . raised concerns that Israel might be preparing an imminent strike on . Iranian nuclear facilities. The U.S. and other Western countries have . been pressing Israel to give sanctions more time. In New Delhi, Tal Yehoshua-Koren, the . wife of an Israeli official, was in a car heading to pick up her . children from school when a motorcyclist attached a magnetic bomb to the . vehicle. Witnesses reported a person being flung from the car by the . explosion that turned the vehicle into a fireball. The woman and her driver, Manoj Sharma, survived and were taken to hospital. The Israeli Defence Ministry said Mrs Yehoshua-Koren, was being treated at a local . hospital by Israeli doctors. The New Delhi attack took . place just a few hundred metres from the prime minister's residence as . the diplomat's wife was heading to the American Embassy School to pick . up her children, said Delhi Police Commissioner B.K. Gupta. Accusations: Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has accused Iran of being behind the attacks and said Israel has thwarted other attacks in recent months in Azerbaijan, Thailand and elsewhere . When . the car approached a crossing, she noticed a motorcyclist ride up and . stick something on it that appeared to be a magnetic device, he said. The car drove a short distance, there was a loud sound and then an explosion and the car caught fire, he said. 'It . was a loud explosion. We realized it's not a firecracker, but an . explosion, and rushed toward the car,' said Ravi Singh, 50, owner of a . gas station near the blast site. 'The blast was so powerful, the car behind got damaged as well,' said Monu, a nearby high school student who uses only one name. Similar . weapons were used against Iran's nuclear scientists, feeding suspicions . that the new bombings were a retaliation crafted to mirror those . attacks . At around the same time, in Tbilisi, a grenade was found attached to a car used by the Israeli ambassador, Yitzhak Gerberg. Mr Netanyahu said: ‘Iran is behind these attacks and it is the largest terror exporter in the world.’ Shota Utiashvili, spokesman for the . Georgian Interior Ministry, said the driver noticed a package attached . to his car's undercarriage on Monday and called police. Killed: Last month, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a director of Iran's main uranium enrichment died in a blast from a magnetic bomb placed on his car . Police found a grenade in the package and it was defused, Mr Utiashvili said. He did not specify where the car was parked when the device was discovered. In response Mr Netanyahu member of his party that Israel has thwarted other attacks in recent months in Azerbaijan, Thailand and elsewhere. 'In all those cases, the elements behind these attacks were Iran and its protege Hezbollah,' he said. In what appeared to be a precautionary move, the Israeli ambassador to Egypt was held in the VIP lounge at Cairo's airport for four hours while police dogs sniffed two embassy cars waiting for him. He later left for home under tight security, and the lounge was thoroughly searched by police. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But copying the exact style of the murder of Roshan in Tehran appears a very deliberate statement in itself. Hezbollah recently marked the anniversary of the 2008 assassination of one of its commanders, Imad Mughniyeh, in a bombing widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. And Iran suspects Israeli involvement in a series of killings of officials and scientists aimed at halting their nuclear programme, which many fear is a thinly veiled ploy to build a nuclear bomb. Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told cheering crowds gathered in Tehran that a significant development was soon to announced. And Britain and the United States have moved warships into the Straits of Hormuz with a view to keeping the vital oil trade route open.

"Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he travelled to Syria to join the barbaric Islamic State. Security officials have now identified the Briton who played a key role in the murder videos of UK aid worker David Haines and two American journalists. But his name and background are being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions. Scroll down for video . Intelligence agencies are said to have identified 'Jihadi John' but have postponed raids on his associates over fears such actions could hamper any attempt to rescue his hostages . It is believed the hostages are being held in tunnels beneath Raqqa (pictured, above), which has become an IS stronghold . Police and security agents also want to gather more information before raiding the homes of the fanatic’s family and friends. They believe covert operations are the best way to find out where in Syria the militant is based. Crucially, he is believed to be close to where the IS group is holding some of its international hostages, including 47-year-old taxi driver Alan Henning, from Manchester. John threatened the father-of-two with beheading at the end of the video in which Mr Haines, 44, was seen before and after his murder. Despite the huge numbers that have watched the gruesome propaganda videos, John has yet to be named publicly. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary – a London rapper initially identified as a suspect – has been ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms. The 23-year-old, whose father is awaiting trial in the US on terror charges linked to embassy bombings in East Africa, came to prominence earlier this year after he posted a photograph of himself on Twitter holding up a severed head. ‘Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,’ he wrote on his Twitter account, which has since been deactivated. A shortlist of potential identities for Jihadi John was drawn up soon after the first video appeared of him executing US journalist James Foley - and authorities are now said to have a suspect . Other Britons from Portsmouth, Birmingham and Cardiff have been linked to John, who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for French and Italian captives freed in return for ransoms. It is claimed he was making street collections for genuine Arab charities based in London at the time he came to MI5’s attention. Anti-terror investigators looking at the support networks of fighters in Syria have often focused on charities. Officials have repeatedly stressed that having somebody on their radar is not the same as placing them under surveillance. In the case of Jihadi John, he is understood to have become radicalised almost overnight and left Britain more than a year ago, where he quickly became a hardened fighter. There is no suggestion that MI5 or the police had any basis to stop him from travelling abroad. British and US signals specialists in Baghdad and the Kurdish city of Irbil have been working with GCHQ to pinpoint where he is now. Aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment, which can eavesdrop on conversations taking place tens of thousands of feet below, are listening to see if they can pick up a voice match. All three murder videos have been broken down piece by piece and studied to provide clues on where they were filmed. Security experts believe the black-robed killer ranting on the video is British, rather than that a British voice has been dubbed over the footage. The jihadist wears a black mask, concealing all but his eyes, making it difficult to be sure the voice belonged to him. But audio experts say they are ‘99 per cent’ certain the words were spoken by the man seen on camera. Linguistic experts believe the way he pronounced certain words, such as Iraqi place names, suggest he has a foreign language background – indicating his parents or grandparents may have come from the Middle East. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called a emergency Cobra meeting soon after the latest video emerged so defence and security chiefs could plan their response . He appears to have a skin tone consistent with someone of African, Middle Eastern or South Asian descent. It is not believed that John or the hostages are far from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa where IS has established its headquarters. The city has a warren of underground tunnels where hostages are believed to have been held. Spy planes revealed that US hostage James Foley was executed near the Ittihad University in the city. Jihadi John is among some 500 Britons who have travelled to Syria – and now Iraq – with around 250 returning, 200 of them to the London area. In a speech to the JFK School of Government at Harvard University last night, Theresa May said the Government was seeking new powers to remove the passports from extremists. She described the murder of David Haines as ‘an absolutely barbaric act’, adding: ‘Our message has to be clear. The United Kingdom, like the United States, will not allow these grotesque acts to stop us from keeping our homelands secure and stopping the march of this brutal ideology.’","Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he went to Syria to join Islamic State .

"A US doctor's plan to develop a formula for 'vacation breasts' that sees cup size increase for a period of two to three weeks has been met with concern by a top UK plastic surgeon. New York-based specialist Dr Norman Rowe's research into temporary breast enhancement is set to be developed into a treatment that could give women the ultimate beach body for a holiday. However, a British surgeon says there are risks associated with the treatment, including infection, severe bruising and even being left with breasts of totally different sizes for an unknown amount of time. For women who strive for the perfect bikini body, the new temporary boob-job might be welcomed . Dr Norman Rowe is developing a formula that could see women have a temporary breast enhancement . Dr Rowe, who developed the 24-hour InstaBreast, is now working on a new project, aptly tagged 'vacation breasts' which will extend the lifespan of a saline injection. But Dr Ash Mosahebi, director of surgery of the London Plastic Surgery Centre, with over 15 years experience in the field, is sceptical about the process. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Travel, consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) member Dr Mosahebi said: 'I can see why this is being looked at, and sometimes temporary solutions kind of work. 'But for me the main issue is the chance of getting infections and the chance of further complications. It is a 'quick fix' for women to boost their cup size, but what are the risks involved with 'vacation breasts'? UK-based surgeon Dr Ash Mosahebi has warned their could be problems with such a procedure . 'There is much more to consider than it just been a 'quick fix' - if it's not done right there is a chance you could puncture a lung. The 'vacation breasts' procedure appears straightforward and safe by recent details published in the US media. However, as with any intrusive action on the human body there are risks to be wary of. These could be: . 'If it sounds so simple as just putting a needle in and getting bigger breasts then you will get more and more people not only wanting it done and more and more people who want to do it - but it has to be done correctly. 'The key thing for me is, what you rely on here is that the saline is absorbed, but one side could go quicker than the other. You could be left with one side a B cup and one side a D cup, and who knows how long for. 'These are the risks that are taken as it is not a controlled process.' Dr Rowe's hopes are that women will take advantage of the treatment for holidays and special occasions, as well as give them a real feeling of what a potential 'under the knife' operation will feel like day to day. But Dr Mosahebi believes rather than simply take on-board the short-term benefits and psychological advantages, it's vital any potential customers are aware of the facts. 'Sometimes we do experiments similar (on an artificial breast) on the table in the lab, just to see what it would be like,' added the 46-year-old expert. The 2-3 week breast enhancement might give new confidence to women on the beach (Posed by model) It is believed that a two-three week breast size increase could help a woman decide if she wanted to opt for a permanent cup enhancement . 'We know of what the results could be, but I can't imagine people would know all the facts about the operation.' US-based Dr Rowe pioneered the InstaBreast procedure where, after only between 15 and 20 minutes, women's breasts are given a boost by a simple saline injection. The enhancement lasts for roughly 24 hours before the breasts return to their normal size.

"No-one said overthrowing the capitalist system was going to be easy. They may have pitched their tents in cities from Philadelphia to Paris - braving pepper-spraying police officers and poor sanitary conditions. But now the Occupy movement's hardy protesters are putting themselves even further to the test by taking on plummeting temperatures - and the world's rich and famous - by building an igloo camp outside the World Economic Forum. Activists armed with pick-axes carved up blocks of ice as they prepared to dig in for the annual gathering at the Swiss ski-resort of Davos, which starts tomorrow. Scroll down for video... Protesters building an igloo which will be used as a home during the World Economic Forum . Members of Occupy begin work on their igloo ahead of the World Economic Forum . A member of Occupy finishing touches to an igloo built to house protesters outside the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos . To counter any possible threat, thousands of Swiss soldiers today battled against heavy snowfall to put up 11 miles of security barriers. Swiss army spokesman Stefan Hofer said it had made construction of the traditional 'ring of steel' an arduous task. He also revealed that difficult weather conditions could limit the number of helicopter flights the Swiss army can conduct to ferry heads of state and government from Zurich airport to the remote resort. More than 2,600 decision-makers from . nearly 100 countries and hundreds of companies will descend on the town - a regular haunt for British Chancellor . George Osborne and Prince Charles.

The Occupy protesters are bringing a . mix of grievances, inspired by protests that started around Wall Street . last year and spread to cities around the world. 'We'll . make small actions in the village, we're going to disturb things a . little bit,' said organiser David Roth, a Swiss leftist politician . camped out for the week. One . of their banners reflected the disillusionment in developed . democracies: 'If voting could change anything it would be illegal.'

Up on high: Swiss soldiers walk past an army helicopter as a warning was issued that flights may be limited, due to heavy snowfall, over the next few days . Chief executives from China will garner attention, but Europe will be the damaged star of this year's forum. It is a painful irony for organisers who have worked for years to expand its reach beyond the Europeans and Americans who built its reputation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel formally . launches the meeting with a keynote speech tomorrow that may chart her . course for Europe's debt crisis in the coming months. The list of Davos participants is heftier than ever in its four-decade history, with nearly 40 heads of state and 18 of the world's central bankers. They will be joined by business leaders, scientists, thinkers, pioneers for human rights and others for the invitation-only week of brainstorming that aims to set the global agenda for the year to come. 'It's the perfect barometer of the temperature of the world,' Moisi said. Four years after the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing financial meltdown, growth remains anaemic in the rich world. Many in Europe and the U.S. - especially those without work - feel betrayed by solutions that they feel favoured the very bankers and financial players blamed for the crisis. In rich and developing economies, income inequalities are on the rise. The Swiss resort of Davos will host the five-day World Economic Forum . Talkers: U2's Bono (left) pictured at the WEF in 2011, while forum founder Klaus Schwab (right) talks in advance about the conference last week . Forum organisers warned earlier this month that financial troubles of the past few years are fuelling resentment that could spark protectionism, nationalism and social unrest. That is a particularly potent message for three world powers facing elections this year - the U.S., Russia and France - as well as for the Arab world after its string of uprisings. Everyone will be looking for what organisers are calling 'new models.' The overarching question for many government leaders will be how to restore growth despite rising debts and sinking market confidence. Business leaders will hold private . panels on how to employ more young people, restore faith in leadership, . make cleaner energy more economically appealing, and profit from new . technology. Public figures expected include British Prime Minister David Cameron, Israeli President Shimon Peres, U.N.

"A young Arsenal fan returned home from school on Thursday to discover Jack Wilshere waiting for a kickabout in his back garden. The Arsenal midfielder had decided to visit schoolboy Archie Hill after being told about his appeal to Prime Minister David Cameron. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere surprises young Arsenal fan after school . Jack Wilshere and young Arsenal fan Archie Hill play football  game on his PlayStation . Archie, who suffers from life-limiting muscle wasting disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, had asked for help with his condition. The nine-year-old approached Mr Cameron after a breakthrough drug for his condition - which currently means he is unlikely to live beyond 30 - became available in several European countries. After the meeting, Mr Cameron raised the issue of treatment in the House of Commons, saying he wanted to see vital drugs licensed as quickly as possible. Archie put on his favourite Arsenal shirt for a kickabout with Gunners midfielder Wilshere . Wilshere had waited for nine-year-old Archie to return home from school on Thursday . Archie and his brother Leyton show off their Arsenal memorabilia to Wilshere . Wilshere was impressed with how Archie had written to the Prime Minister asking for some help in his fight against the debilitating illness. The 23-year-old England star subsequently paid a visit to the youngster's home, before having a kickabout in his back garden with brother Leyton and playing PlayStation with the pair. Wilshere said: 'It's been fantastic meeting Archie and Leyton. My mum told me about Archie's interview and I was really impressed by how grown up he was to go on television and to write to the Prime Minister like that. They are really great boys.' Wilshere had been impressed by 'grown up' Archie speaking to the Prime Minister . Wilshere's meeting with the boys was organised by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign . Archie's mum, Louisa, told the Mirror: 'We were absolutely staggered when the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign called us to say Jack had been in touch about meeting Archie. We have had to keep the secret for weeks! 'Meeting Jack was absolutely amazing. He spent hours with the boys, in the garden, on the computer and chatting away. 'It is every child's dream come true to come home from school one day and see their hero standing in the hallway. Archie kept thinking it was a dream and the smile on his face is something that we will always treasure.'","Arsenal fan Archie Hill said Jack Wilshere was his idol during TV interview .

"So large that it can be seen from space, it is enough to send shockwaves through even the most cynical Nessie sceptic. This shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly with two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by a satellite. For six months the image has been studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, where excitement is mounting after various explanations for it were ruled out... leaving them to conclude it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. Scroll down for video . A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, may have provided proof that the legend lives on - with amazing images of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . This new sonar image was revealed just weeks after satellite images appeared to show a mystery object in the loch. A shadowy form, pictured, measuring around 100ft long (30 metres) with two giant flippers was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the Apple Maps app . Club president Gary Campbell, who keeps a register of sightings, said: ‘We’ve been looking at it for a long time trying to work out exactly what it is. ‘It looks like a boat wake, but the boat is missing. You can see some boats moored at the shore, but there isn’t one here. We’ve shown it to boat experts and they don’t know what it is. ‘Whatever this is, it is under the water and heading south, so unless there have been secret submarine trials going on in the loch, the size of the object would make it likely to be Nessie.’ He said other ‘logical’ explanations – such as a floating log or a seal causing ripples – could not be used to account for the imposing shape either. The photographs were captured by two different amateur Nessie hunters scanning different satellites transmitting images of the earth from space - Peter Thain from Northumberland and Andy Dixon County Durham . The image has ended a recent drought in ‘confirmed sightings’ of the creature. In February Mr Campbell announced that no one had come forward in the previous 18 months to say they had seen Nessie – the first time since 1925 this had happened. The club was alerted to the new image by two people who noticed it at the end of last year on satellite pictures used by Apple for its smartphone maps. One of the spotters, Andrew Dixon, 26, a charity worker for the Great North Air Ambulance, from Darlington, County Durham, said: ‘It was a total fluke that I found it. I was looking at satellite images of my town and then just thought I’d have a look at Loch Ness. ‘The first thing that came into my head when I saw it was, “That’s the Loch Ness Monster”. It was the shape of it, I thought it had to be something more than a shadow. State of the art sonar equipment, a yellow submarine, Hollywood actors and even a white witch have all tried to find the elusive Loch Ness Monster . Mr Dixon said: 'It was purely by accident that I came across the image. I was trawling through satellite transmissions of different parts of the country and I thought I would try Loch Ness' The image was recorded by sonar equipment on board the flagship vessel of Inverness-based Jacobite Cruises as it sailed on Loch Ness, pictured . ‘It was exciting. I’ve never been to Loch Ness but I’m always interested in that sort of stuff.’ Peter Thain, from Newbiggin by the Sea, Northumberland, also came across the same image through Apple’s satellite map app. Both he and Mr Dixon forwarded the image to the club. Mr Campbell, 49, a chartered accountant who lives in Inverness, said: ‘Now that we have spies in the skies above Loch Ness, maybe we will get more sightings which will whet the appetite of more down to earth Nessie hunters to come north. ‘Furthermore, the use of satellite technology means that if Nessie is just swimming below the surface like in this case, we can still pick her up.’ He added: ‘Last year was the first time in almost 90 years that Nessie wasn’t seen at all. After Nessie “going missing” for 18 months, it’s great to see her back.’ Despite the club’s claim, however, another explanation for the shape seen in the image could simply be underwater currents in the loch. Elusive sight: This picture, taken by Dr Kenneth Wilson in 1934, is said to show the Loch Ness Monster . The legend of the Loch Ness Monster . has been around since the sixth century, when an Irish monk called Saint . Columba witnessed locals burying a man who had been attacked by a 'water . beast.' One of the first . famous sightings was in 1933, when George . Spicer and his wife claimed they saw 'a most extraordinary form of . animal' which was 4ft high and 25ft long crossing the road near the . loch. The following year, . Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson took a picture, in main story above, which is . now the most famous picture of the monster, although it was later . revealed to be a hoax made with a toy from Woolworth's. Hunter Marmaduke Wetherell, centre, was said to have faked footprints which he said were the 'monster's' And in 1935, renowned . big game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell found a footprint he said was the . monster's.  It was later revealed to have been made by him using a dried . hippo's foot of the type used as umbrella stands at the time. Despite . many recording sightings over the years, most have been revealed to be . hoaxes and scientists do not give credence to the suggestion that a . monster lives in the loch.","Satellite in the atmosphere was accessed using Apple's satellite map app .

"An Oklahoma Army lieutenant has been found guilty of two counts of murder in connection with a series of shootings in Afghanistan. A jury at Fort Bragg delivered the verdict against Clint Lorance, an 82nd Airborne Division lieutenant, on Thursday evening and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, forfeiture of all pay and dismissal from the U.S. Army. Lorance, 28, was found not guilty of making a false official statement. Prosecutors said Lorance recklessly ordered his men to open fire immediately, after three men on a motorcycle approached his patrol in southern Afghanistan in July 2012. They said this was in violation of the military's rules of engagement, which requires soldiers to hold fire unless they have evidence of hostile action or hostile intent. Two of the men were killed and the third ran away. Devastated: Anna Lorance, right, claims her son, First Lieutenant Clint Lorance, left, has been unfairly victimized by the military . Attorneys for Lorance said he was . trying to protect his unit, and the soldier's supporters have attacked . the military for turning a war hero deployed in a volatile and remote . corner of Afghanistan into a defendant. 'To . put murder charges on him!' Lorance's mother, Anna Lorance, protested . in an interview with The Washington Post before the verdict. 'In war, . people die. When you're in a heated combat zone, you have seconds to . think.' Lorance is only the second Army officer charged with murder in a battlefield death in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His devastated mother had campaigned since the charges were filed that her son was innocent and even created a website to build support for their case. Soldier: First Lieutenant Clint Lorance has been removed from his position and was on Thursday found guilty of two counts of second-degree murder . Anna Lorance claims her son has . been unfairly victimized by the military for allegedly ordering troops . under his command to illegally shoot the two Afghan villagers. He was . immediately removed from his position following the deaths. 'My son does not deserve this,' the mom told ABC11 in May. 'He did the only thing he felt he could do, thinking of his troops and himself, to bring them back home alive.' The . incident happened last July when Lorance, a platoon leader, gave the . order for his soldiers to shoot the men as they approached a checkpoint . on motorcycles in a remote sector of Kandahar Province. Even though the platoon was in a combat zone, military prosecutors say the men showed, 'no indication of a hostile act, or hostile intent.' Lorance claims he was only trying to protect his platoon. Website: Clint Lorance's family set up a website to highlight his case . He . told his mother he was on high alert, heading into enemy territory, and . was getting radio warning from Army pilots patrolling the skies when it . happened. His family believe he has been unfairly treated and have launched a website to highlight his case. More than 3,000 people from around the world have signed a petition to drop the charges. 'There's no way my son could do anything besides give 100 percent of himself to be an officer,' said Anna Lorance. Lorance was . also accused of making false official statements, ordering illegal . harassing fire into a village, obstructing justice and making threats . against villagers. The two soldiers who fired the shots have been reprimanded but won't have to go through a full court martial.","First Lieutenant Clint Lorance was found guilty of two counts of second-degree murder on Thursday .

"The teenagers captured in a remarkable photo by Ringo Starr in 1964 were suspended as soon as they got back to High School. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Bob Toth,66, shown in the passenger seat of the car said: ‘The principal certainly suspended me for three days as soon as we got back to school. 'The story didn’t even make it into the yearbook because he didn’t want to look like he was encouraging kids to cut school.’ Caught: Bob Toth (front passenger seat, left), Gary Van Deursen, (next to him) Suzanne Rayot, Arlene Norbe Ressler and Charlie Schwartz pictured by Ringo Starr on the day they cut class to see their idols The Beatles . Forty years later he met his former . principal at church: ‘He said to me, “You know, in retrospect what you did that day . was a very good idea.""' The search for the friends who . skipped classes that day began after Ringo Starr, 73, wrote in his new . book, 'Photograph' how much he would like to know who the teenagers . were. 'It's just a great shot,' he wrote. 'They're looking at us, and I'm photographing them.' It has now emerged that they were, from . left, Bob Toth, Gary Van Deursen, Suzanne Rayot, Arlene Norbe Ressler, . Charlie Scwartz and Matt Blender. And Mr Toth admitted that he had no idea the photograph even existed until today. He said: ‘It’s kind of nice to have something legitimise the story we’ve all told on and off over the years.’ The way they were: Bob Toth,66, today pointing to himself in the Ringo Starr picture that has become a sensation. He was in the front of the car  next to best friend Gary Van Deursen, 67 . No invention: Gary Van Deursen at his home in Connecticut holding a copy of the picture (he is circled) caught by Ringo Starr on February 7 1964 . The car belonged to Mr Toth's best friend, Gary Van Deursen, 67, who today revealed himself to be the driver in the photograph. He told MailOnline that none of his friends had believed his story until now. The chance meeting took place on . February 7, 1964 when The Beatles were to arrive at JFK, two days before their first appearance on 'The Ed Sullivan . Show'. Van Deursen explained: 'I took my Chevy convertible – it was white with a red interior. We cut school and decided we'd try to see The Beatles. It was so hyped so of course we got to the airport and it was mobbed. 'We went up to the top of the international building I believe it was. There was a crowd on the roof and reporters and one of my friends, Matt Blender, put on a British accent. 'A reporter overheard him and interviewed him life on the local radio. I was laughing so hard I had to move away.' Skipping school: Van Deursen, pictured left in . his yearbook, asked some of his friends if they wanted to miss class to . see the band and they jumped into his car. They were also joined by . Robert Toth, right . School Days: Charlie Schwartz (left) has also recounted the excitment of meeting Starr - but how no one believed them. He said that his closest friend from the group, Matt Blender (right) has since died . Highlight of their lives: Suzanne Rayot pictured in her yearbook in 1965, the year after that unforgettable day . He continued: 'As we were driving home, back across George Washington bridge a limousine passed us, then another, then another, then another and we realised it was The Beatles each in a separate limo. 'I crossed over lanes and overtook so they would all pass us again. The last one had Ringo Starr in it and the reporter from TIME magazine – though we didn't know that then.' According to Mr Toth until then the friends had actually left JFK disappointed: ‘It was such a mad scene at . JFK that we left disappointed because we just thought there was no way . we’d get close to the band. 'Then we saw all these limousines as we were . driving home and pretty soon realised it wasn’t a funeral it was the . Beatles.’ Starr, he said, was ‘the friendly one,' who leaned out of the window and spoke over the screams of the . two female passengers who, Toth laughed, could not contain their . excitement. He said: ‘Suzanne was behind me, screaming her lungs out. It was crazy.’ Mr Van Deursen continued: 'Ringo gestured to us to wind down the window so we did. He asked where we were from and one of the kids in the car held up his jacket with the school name on it because it was hard to hear Fair Lawn. 'We didn't have tickets to the show which was sold out and we asked Ringo if he could get us any. He said he was sorry he couldn't help.' Youth: Arlene Norbe, circled, also joined the group in skipping school in an attempt to see the band . School days: Norbe is circled again. She is now believed to be living with her husband in New Jersey . Today the friends who drove to JFK . that day are scattered across the country, but Mr Toth still lives in . New Jersey where he works as a Senior Sales Engineer for an Air conditioning and Heating firm and lives with wife Nanci, 49. Mr Van Deursen . runs his own company as an inventor and designer. He lives in . Connecticut with his wife, Alison, with whom he has a son and daughter. His career as an industrial designer and inventor has seen him live in . Europe as Vice President and Head of Design for Black & Decker as . well as Head of Design for General Electric and Coleman Outdoor Camping . Equipment. Principal Daniel A Rothermel: At the time he took a firm line on the teens'excursion. Years later he admitted, 'it was a good idea' But however successful his career and . life since that day on George Washington bridge he said: ‘It was the . highlight of our lives really. Though I should say it was reported in . TIME that I lost control of the car – I never did. Still we were glad . when that piece came out. 'We . had gone back to school and told everyone the story about how we had . seen the Beatles and spoken to Ringo Starr and nobody believed us. They . thought it was just some crazy story we were all making up.' Schwartz has also spoken out about the once-in-a-life experience. 'We were hardcore rock-and-rollers,' Schwartz told the New Jersey Record. 'It was all about the music.' Schwartz, then 17, had just arrived at . the school student lounge when Van Deursen said he had a car and was . going to drive to see the musicians. Schwartz said: 'He said, ""Are you in or are you out?"" I said, ""I'm in"".' They skipped class and headed to Queens. But . when they arrived it was madness so they were forced to turn the car . around for the direction of home, they came across the group. He recounted how they pulled up alongside Ringo's car and that the musician began snapping away at them. He . said he is no longer in touch with the others in the car and said . that Blender - his closest friend - has since passed away, NewJersey.com . reported. Ringo's team has not yet contacted him, but the media has been knocking, he said. Memories: Starr stands beside the image at Genesis Publications unveiling of the book on Wednesday . Fab Four: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr shot to stardom as The Beatles . 'The . whole thing seems quite surreal, but it’s a gas,' he said. 'It's a lot . of fun. I've talked to people I haven't talked to for quite a while. I’ve gotten calls from all around the country.' The Beatle had put out an appeal for the group, hoping that someone would recognize them. The picture is being published for the first time in Starr’s new book Photograph, along with over 200 never-before-seen shots. The Beatles formed in . Liverpool in the late 1950s with their most famous line-up being John . Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.

"This is the moment a drinker got himself impaled on a metal spike after he tried to climb over a beer garden gate - even though the gate was open. The inebriated punter had been turned away by bouncers for being too drunk when he turned up at The Fiddlers pub in Northampton on Saturday night. But the man was so determined to get into the Christmas party he decided it would be a good idea to try and sneak in via the beer garden instead. Foolish: This is the moment a man impaled his leg on the gate of The Fiddlers pub in Wellingborough Road, Northampton after being refused entry. He tried to climb over the metal gate - even though it was open . Despite the back gate being wide open he still attempted to clamber over a pointed metal fence - but slipped and impaled his leg on a metal spike. Emergency services were called to the pub in Wellingborough Road at around 1.40am and found the man dangling upside down from the fence. Despite having pierced the lower part of his left leg the 30-year-old appeared to be in 'good spirits' and was so drunk he could not feel any pain. Fire crews worked for half an hour to cut the fence in seven places to release the reveller who was then taken to hospital. A spokesman for the Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Somebody had their leg impaled on a metal fence in Wellingborough Road. 'They were released safely by us and then taken to Northampton General Hospital by the ambulance service.' Drama: Emergency services were called to The Fiddlers pub in Wellingborough Road at around 1.40am and found the man dangling . upside down from the fence . Rob Eastham, manager of The Fiddlers, said the man has been refused entry by the bouncers because of his 'inebriated condition'. He said: 'The bouncers came to his aid after he was calling out for some attention. He had been refused entry because he was so drunk. 'He tried to climb over the fence. Although the back gate was open and he could have just walked through it. 'They could not give him any pain relief as he had been upside down so long they could not find a vein. 'But he seemed fine and, maybe because of the drink, he did not seem to be feeling the pain.' One punter, who had been enjoying the night out on Saturday, said: 'Everybody found it hilarious the gate was open and had no need to climb over anyway.

"Overweight 11-year-olds did less well at school at 16, a new study has found (stock image) Its damage to health is well known, but obesity could also harm a child’s exam success. A study found that girls who were dangerously overweight at 11 did less well at school at 16. The effect was big enough to make the difference between gaining a C and a D at GCSE. The British researchers said that while the health effects of obesity receive a lot of attention, the problems do not end there. They also warned that the knock-on effects could be lifelong. Latest figures show that almost 20 per cent of 10 to 11 year olds in England are obese. A further 15 per cent are overweight. The researchers analysed data from a long-running study of children born in the Bristol area in the early 1990s. This included IQ at age eight, weight through the teenage years and school results. No clear effect was found for boys but crunching the figures showed that girls who were obese at 11 did less well in tests at 11 and 13. They also fared less well in maths, science and English GCSEs at 16. The study, published in the International Journal of Obesity also showed that the longer the child was obese, the bigger the effect on their schoolwork. Strikingly, the effect of obesity remained even when factors such as socio-economic status, the amount of exercise done and depression were taken into account. IQ, measured at age eight , was also factored in. Given this, the researchers aren’t entirely sure why obesity affects how a child does at school but some research has suggested it slows the development of the brain. It is also possible that the psychological scars of obesity run deep. For instance, bullying by other children may lower self-esteem and lead to youngsters taking more time off school and so missing lessons. Teachers may also treat obese children differently to their normal-weight classmates. The researchers tried to account for depression the study but say they may not have been able to factor in the full effect of the stigma of obesity on mental health. Teenage boys are thought to be less sensitive to the effects of bullying than girls, perhaps explaining why no link was found for males. Researchers analysed data from a long-running study of children born in the Bristol area in the early 1990s, including IQ at age eight, weight through the teenage years and school results (library image) With poor school grades having a knock-on effect on higher education and employment, the effects of being obese as young as 11 could be long-lasting. Lead researcher, Professor John Reilly, of the University of Strathclyde, said: ‘Further work is needed to understand why obesity is negatively related to academic attainment but it is clear that teenagers, parents and policymakers in education and public health should be aware of the lifelong educational and economic impact of obesity.’ Dundee University researcher Dr Josie Booth said: ‘The key message is that obesity has a wide-reaching impact and we need to be doing more to help children attain a healthy lifestyle.’ Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, hit out at schools for rewarding children with chocolate and punishing them by stopping them from playing football. He added: ‘It is not only academic achievement, marriage and university prospects are also lower in obese kids. ‘It is very worrying and it is another dimension to the obesity problem. ‘Everybody thinks about obesity and diabetes but when you think that success in life is affected by your weight, it is pretty serious.’","Study found overweight 11-year-olds did less well at school at 16 .

"More than a million selfies are taken every day, and a third of us admit to digitally retouching our self-portraits before uploading them online. But researchers from the University of Surrey claim that many of these images could be improved simply taking note of some of their tips. For example, when using a smartphone, the closer the person can get to the lens the better when trying to capture the perfect selfie. Scroll down for video . Researchers from the University of Surrey claim that many selfies could be improved simply by holding the camera further away, and zooming in, to change the perspective. But when using a smartphone, place the camera at arm's length,  and hold the phone in landscape when taking group shots (Oscars selfie is pictured) A conventional digital camera's wide-angle lens should be positioned further away from the subject and zoomed in, to achieve a more accurate perspective. On . smartphone cameras, however, a person can be positioned much closer to the phone.

Dr Andrew Pye and Dr Radu Sporea, . photography experts and research fellows from the University of Surrey, . revealed the tips during their ‘A Perfect Picture - the science behind . good photos’ talk at the British Science Festival this weekend. When using a digital camera, Dr Sporea and Dr Pye said that a wide-angle lens needs to be positioned further away from the subject and zoomed in, to achieve a more accurate perspective. When a wide-angle lens is too close to a subject, the distance from the lens is approximately the same distance between the subject’s features. This causes the image to be distorted.

Reserved for priests: In February the women climbed into a reserved area of the Church of Christ the Saviour and performed a 'punk prayer' against Putin . Punishment doesn't fit crime: The musicians expressed have their opinions that the jail sentence was 'entirely disproportionate' echoing the sentiments of protestors outside the court on July 30 . The letter . continues: ‘Dissent is a right in any democracy and it is entirely . disproportionate that they face seven years in jail for what we consider . a preposterous charge of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred”. ‘We are especially concerned about recent reports that food is being withheld from them and that they have appeared in court in a cage. Visiting the UK: The British pop stars have asked that Russian President Vladimir Putin, visiting the UK this week, give the three women a fair hearing . ‘We believe firmly that it is the role of the artist to make legitimate political protest and fight for freedom of speech. ‘As he visits the United Kingdom this week, we ask President Putin to ensure these three women receive a fair hearing.’ In February, the women climbed into an area reserved for priests in the Church of Christ the Saviour and performed a ‘punk prayer’ against Putin. The trio were arrested in March and charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred of Orthodox believers. A further ten members of the band, supporters and a few selected journalists were also present during the demonstration but were never arrested.

"Medical advances mean it will soon be possible to bring the dead back to life, a doctor claims. Modern techniques will enable a patient to be revived up to 24 hours after they stop breathing, Dr Sam Parnia says. The American critical care physician, who trained in London, said: ‘We may soon be rescuing people from death’s clutches hours, or even longer, after they have actually died.’ Claims: Dr Sam Parnia says medical advances mean it could soon be possible to bring people back to life 24 hours after they stopped breathing. Dr Parnia also said he could have saved the life of actor James Gandolfini . He claims the US actor James Gandolfini, star of The Sopranos – who died aged 51 in Rome last month – might have survived if he had suffered his massive heart attack in New York. ‘I believe if he died here, he could still be alive. We’d cool him down, pump oxygen to the tissues, which prevents them from dying,’ Dr Parnia told Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine. ‘Clinically dead, he could then be cared for by the cardiologist. He would make an angiogram, find the clot, take it out, put in a stent and we would restart the heart.’ Dr Parnia, whose new book on resuscitation science is called Erasing Death, said death should be reversible for many patients, providing they are in the right place getting the right treatment. ‘Of course we can’t rescue everybody and many people with heart attacks have other major problems,’ he said. ‘But if all the latest medical technologies and training had been implemented, which clearly hasn’t been done, then in principle the only people who should die and stay dead are those that have an underlying condition that is untreatable. ‘A heart attack is treatable. Blood loss as well. A terminal cancer isn’t, neither are many infections with multiresistant pathogens. In these cases, even if we’d restart the heart, it would stop again and again. ‘My basic message: The death we commonly perceive today in 2013 is a death that can be reversed.’ Dr Parnia, head of intensive care at the Stony Brook University Hospital in New York, said resuscitation figures tell their own story. The average resuscitation rate for cardiac arrest patients is 18 per cent in US hospitals and 16 per cent in Britain. But at his hospital it is 33 per cent – and the rate peaked at 38 per cent earlier this year. Eternal life: Critical care physician, Dr Sam Parnia, said his 'revival research' is on the cusp of major breakthroughs which will allow the dead to rise again after being dead for some time . ‘Most, but not all of our patients, get discharged with no neurological damage whatsoever,’ he said, adding that it is a ‘widely held misconception’ – even among doctors – that the brain begins to suffer massive damage from oxygen deprivation three to five minutes after the heart stops. ‘In the past decade we have seen tremendous progress. With today’s medicine, we can bring people back to life up to one, maybe two hours, sometimes even longer, after their heart stopped beating and they have thus died by circulatory failure. ‘In the future, we will likely get better at reversing death.’ The techniques he advocates are not cryogenics – freezing the body immediately after death – but cooling it down to best preserve brain cells while keeping up the level of oxygen in the blood. This buys time to fix the underlying problem and restart the heart, he claims. He says that if someone collapses with a heart attack, call 999 then immediately place bags of frozen vegetables on them until the ambulance arrives, as it helps protect the brain. ‘It is possible that in 20 years, we may be able to restore people to life 12 hours or maybe even 24 hours after they have died. ‘You could call that resurrection, if you will. But I still call it resuscitation science.’","Dr Sam Parnia said his research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs .
At the moment medics can bring people back to life within two hours but he believes this window is about to be significantly widened .
Average resuscitation rate for cardiac arrest patients in UK is 16% but at Dr Parnia's Stony Brook University School of Medicine it is 33% .

"Peter Crouch’s manager won’t be worrying about whether his star player will be focused on the game tomorrow evening - Abbey Clancy’s pregnancy has put a stop to any late night shenanigans in their household. The model has revealed she isn’t letting her husband anywhere near her because she has been suffering from severe morning sickness and her swelling body is painful to touch. She told The Times: ‘One part of your brain is going, 'Oh my God, I'm so blessed, it's a miracle', and the other half is going, 'I can't bear this, I'm so fat, I'm ugly, I've got headaches, I've got spots, I feel sick.’ Scroll down for video .

'Pete's not too happy with me moaning every two seconds (and) the perks — the big boobs and that — he can't go anywhere near because they're too painful.’ The only pro so far is her change in diet – the 29 year old has been loading up on carbohydrates in an effort to stem her constant nausea, which involves snacking on items including croissants, cream cheese bagels and muffins. Abbey and Peter’s second child is due in April and the couple have decided to keep the sex a mystery until the birth. The couple had hoped for a daughter the first time and were delighted with the arrival of Sofia in March 2011, but Abbey has revealed that they have no preference this time.

No10 regarded as a ‘cynical ploy’ to stop her German socialist rival . Martin Schulz getting the job. In . a last-minute gambit, Mr Cameron told Mr Van Rompuy at the No10 meeting . on Monday that he intended to demand a formal vote on Mr Juncker’s . appointment, to shame the ‘Juncker turncoats’ – as one British diplomat . called them – at Friday’s summit in Brussels where the final decision . was taken. Mr . Cameron was convinced that Mr Van Rompuy, the chairman of the EU . Council, planned to nod it through with Frau Merkel in a bogus attempt . to claim the EU was united. If . Cameron needed inspiration to give Mr Van Rompuy a Lady Thatcher-style . Euro handbagging, he had chosen the right setting for their meeting. Two against one: David Cameron thought that . he had Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel onside in his battle against . Jean-Claude Juncker only for them to turn on him . The White Room was redecorated in Georgian style on the personal orders of Margaret Thatcher when she was in No10. Cameron fixed Mr Van Rompuy with a Maggie-style glare as they sat opposite each other on opposing cream sofas. ‘If it is to be Juncker, I insist on a formal vote,’ said Cameron. Mr Van Rompuy blinked: ‘I will decide how the vote is conducted.’ Mr Cameron: ‘You must guarantee there will be a proper vote.’ Mr Van Rompuy: ‘I have said I will decide that.’ Mr . Cameron’s face flushed with frustration: ‘I don’t want you saying . “anyone who agrees with David raise your hands?” after I have spoken. I . want a vote, and the names recorded.’ Still, Mr Van Rompuy sat on the fence. Mr Cameron finally snapped: ‘If you won’t give me that assurance, there is no point in continuing this meeting.’ Mr Van Rompuy glanced at his chief of staff, sitting next to him, then across to Mr Cameron, and finally at the floor. Thrown out: Mr Van Rompuy was described by . Ukip's leader Nigel Farage as having 'all the charisma of a damp rag and . the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk' Mr . Cameron leapt to his feet and motioned that the meeting was over. He . led Mr Van Rumpuy to No10’s famous black door where they shook hands and . said goodbye with the minimum of degree of cordiality needed to observe . diplomatic protocol. But . it did not mask the truth: Mr Van Rompuy, cruelly described by Ukip’s . leader Nigel Farage as  having ‘all the charisma of a damp rag and the . appearance of a low-grade bank clerk,’ had been thrown out in all but . name. By . the time Mr Cameron arrived for an EU leaders’ dinner at the  historic . Ypres Cloth Hall in Belgium on Thursday, to commemorate the 100th . anniversary of the First World War, he knew he had lost the ‘Battle of . Juncker’. Other EU leaders, and Frau Merkel in particular, feared embarrassing headlines of ‘Fresh Anglo-German Hostilities At Ypres’. They needn’t have worried: Mr Cameron made a tactical, and diplomatic retreat. ‘I . am not going to cause a fuss. It is an important moment in the history . of Europe and we must honour it properly,’ he said. In reality, he had . little ammunition left. Afterwards, . his limousine took him direct to Brussels, where he talked late into . the night with the UK’s envoy to the EU, Ivan Rogers, to discuss his . tactics for the crunch meeting on Juncker at the EU Council’s ‘Justus . Lipsius’ HQ, named after a 16th-Century Brussels philosopher who . advocated the virtues of constancy. It . was a trait the Prime Minister found hard to identify as he surveyed . the 27 others leader sitting around him on the 80th floor. He . eyeballed each and every one of them: the ones who had told him Mr . Juncker was ‘too federalist’, who told him in hushed tones he ‘drinks a . little too much’, who told him Mr Juncker was ‘lazy’. In . return, he told them why they would live to regret abandoning the . traditional power of elected EU leaders to block the appointment of an . EU Commission President if it was against a vital national interest. Under . the new, and suitably Teutonic titled ‘spitzenkandidaten’ (German for . frontrunners) rule, parties in the EU parliaments choose the candidates. German . speaking Mr Juncker was the ‘spitzenkandidat’ of the European Peoples . Party, even though it has less than one in three of the total number of . MEPs – and none from the UK. Mr . Cameron did not mince his words: ‘Some people are bringing the EU into . disrepute by saying one thing in public and another in private. Let me . tell you bluntly, you will regret this. Britain has a problem with Mr . Juncker because of his federalist views. He does not mean anything to . people in Britain. They don’t know him. How could they? He has never . campaigned there,’ he added caustically. ‘This . time it is our problem. But next time, it will be you. Anyone round . this table who has a strong objection to an EU President will be . trapped. By giving away the power of leaders to defend their national . interests you, too, will be powerless to act.’ And he went round the room, picking off his targets. Looking . towards the leaders of the three former Soviet Union Baltic States, . Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, he said: ‘Our protection for you is taken . for granted, but another president could disagree.’ He . moved on to Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. ‘We put your interests ahead . of those of Russia, but what if a spitzenkandidat president thinks that . trade deals with Russia are more important?’ Continuing . his virtual tour of the EU southwards, he said: ‘Greece has remained in . the Eurozone, but what if a future president wants them out? They’d be . stuck.’ The . economies of Italy and France could suffer if a new president wanted to . change the ‘growth and stability pact’ which stops debt- ridden EU . countries going broke.

"A marine science instructor snorkeling off the Southern California coast spotted something out of a fantasy novel: the silvery carcass of an 18-foot-long, serpent-like oarfish. Jasmine Santana of the Catalina Island Marine Institute needed more than 15 helpers to drag the giant sea creature with eyes the size of half dollars to shore on Sunday. Staffers at the institute are calling it the discovery of a lifetime. Scroll down for video . Incredible: An 18-foot-long oarfish found dead in the water off Catalina Island near Los Angeles, California . 'We've never seen a fish this big,' said Mark Waddington, senior captain of the Tole Mour, CIMI's sail training ship. 'The last oarfish we saw was three feet long.' Because oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep, sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied, according to CIMI. The obscure fish apparently died of natural causes. Tissue samples and video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Science instructor Santana spotted something shimmering about 30 feet deep while snorkeling during a staff trip in Toyon Bay at Santa Catalina Island, about two dozen miles from the mainland. An illustration of Bank's Oarfish, circa 1850, the giant fish that inspired tales of sea serpents. The 18-foot oarfish found off California took 16 people to haul ashore . 'She was snorkeling and sees this giant fish at the bottom of the ocean,' Waddington told KTLA. 'She swims down and grabs it by the tail and swims it to the beach. It was awesome. There were people sprinting to go and see this fish.' Waddington said Santana dragged the fish ashore because 'she said, ""nobody will believe me"".' After she pulled the carcass by the tail for more than 75 feet, staffers waded in and helped her bring it to shore. The carcass was on display Tuesday for 5th, 6th, and 7th grade students studying at CIMI. The oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet, is a deep-water pelagic fish — the longest bony fish in the world, according to CIMI. They are likely responsible for the supposed sea serpent legends throughout history. The giant oarfish was first discovered in 1772 by Norwegian biologist Peter Ascanius. It's formal scientific title is Regalecus glesne, but the fish is also known as king of the herring, Pacific oarfish, streamer fish and ribbon-fish. The longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet, however, the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds. Like . the equally mysterious giant squid, the oarfish would go on to enchant . fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters. The fish lives at extreme ocean depths, between 656 feet (0.2 kilometers) and 3,280 feet (1 kilometer) deep. In 1996, a group of Navy Seals found a 23-foot long oarfish off Coronado, near San Diego, California. In 1996, Navy Seals pulled ashore this 23-foot oarfish that was found off the coast near San Diego, California . The Catalina fish is currently on ice while the fate of the carcass is decided. 'I am pushing to bury it and wait for it to be naturally cleaned so that we can then take the skeleton and articulate it and have it on display,' said Waddington. 'That is what I hope will happen.","Huge oarfish found in waters off Santa Catalina Island near Los Angeles needed 16 people to drag it ashore .

This week Palestinian officials called off a planned round of peace talks after Israeli soldiers killed three protesters during clashes following an arrest raid in the West Bank. The violence, the deadliest incident in the area in years, dealt a new blow to U.S.-led peace efforts, which resumed late last month after a nearly five-year break. Palestinian officials have accused the Israelis of stonewalling and using the process as a cover to build new Jewish settlements. The deaths of Palestinians further soured the atmosphere.

It was not known when talks will resume, but Palestinian officials said the break was expected to be brief. They spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to talk to media. Monday's clashes broke out when Israeli forces entered the Qalandia refugee camp, just outside of Jerusalem, on an overnight arrest raid. Shai Hakimi, a spokesman for the paramilitary border police, said hundreds of Palestinians poured into the streets and hurled firebombs, concrete blocks and rocks at officers. The tunnels are mainly used to transfer cheap fuel and commercial goods but are also occasionally used by fighters to move weapons . The Israeli military said soldiers rushed to the scene to provide backup and opened fire after they felt their lives were in ""imminent danger.""

"The aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un died from a stroke during an impassioned argument about her husband's execution, a defector from the secretive nation has revealed. Kim Kyung Hui, 68, was the sister of Kim's late father Kim Jong II and perhaps the most prominent figure in the oppressive regime. She was a close aide to her own brother Kim Jong-il for decades, assuming senior positions in the party and becoming a four-star general in 2010 . But her husband, Jang Song Thaek, was executed in December, reportedly by a firing squad. Scroll down for video . Kim Kyung Hui died from a stroke during an argument with her nephew and North Korean leader Kim Jong II concerning the execution of her husband, Jang Song Thaek in December last year . Jang Song Thaek was executed, allegedly by a firing squad on charges of trying to overthrow the government . Ms Kim was frequently seen at the side of her nephew and his wife at public events until January this year . According to Kang Myung-do, a defector who was son-in-law to North Korea's ex-Prime Minister, Kang Sun San, Ms Kim was on the phone to her nephew arguing about the execution when she had the stroke. She was hospitalised and died later. The death was not announced as the government did not want people to link her death to her husband's, who had been labelled 'despicable human scum, worse than a dog'. Ms Kim was frequently seen at the side of her nephew and his wife at public events until January this year, when her last public appearance was in the documentary shown on North Korean Central TV. In that footage, aired in January, she was seen walking with the leader and his wife towards the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in the capital, Pyongyang, to pay tribute to the embalmed bodies of former leaders Kil Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. The Kim family has ruled the reclusive, impoverished state for more than six decades with an iron fist and a pervasive personality cult. Before his execution, Jang was viewed as an integral figure in his rise - but he was killed in brutal fashion . Kim Kyong Hui's death was not announced as the regime did not want people to link her death to Jang's . Kim Kyong Hui, who is often the only female face on official photographs of ranks of generals and party leaders, was tasked with transforming her nephew into a figurehead with a reputation for strong military tactics who is able to handle an international crisis. Jang Song Thaek and Kim Kyong Hui met at university and married in 1972. Kim Kyong Hui reportedly had a stroke after a row with her nephew regarding the execution of her husband, Jang Song Thaek . They have no surviving children, according to the South Korean government-run Information Centre on North Korea - their only child, a daughter, committed suicide in 2006 at the age of 29 while studying in Paris, according to South Korean media. While Ms Kim disappeared from public view for six years after 2003, she re-emerged to a more powerful role, being made a four-star general in 2010. She also owns the only burger restaurant in Pyongyang, where the menu offers 'minced meat and bread' rather than using the American word 'burger'. Despite her perceived protection as a direct descendant of nation founder Kim Il-sung, Ms Kim was associated with her husband who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed in December. Jang, the leader's uncle, was considered instrumental in his rise to power. Before his brutal killing, he was described as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea. But Kim Jong Un turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion last year, having him executed on charges of trying to overthrow the government. The North's official Korean Central News Agency indicated that Jang saw the death of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011 as an opportunity to challenge his nephew and win power. Prior to his execution, North Korea accused Jang of corruption, womanizing, gambling and taking drugs, and said he'd been 'eliminated' from all his posts. In even more serious allegations, he was then linked to a claim that he tried 'to overthrow the state by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods with a wild ambition to grab the supreme power of our party and state'. Kim Jong-un went on to describe the execution of his 67-year-old uncle as the removal of 'factionalist filth', in his New Year message, adding that his purge left North Korea in a much stronger position. After his execution, direct family members were said to have been shot dead and other relatives were sentenced to labor camps. Among those killed, reportedly on Kim Jong-un's orders, were North Korea's ambassadors to Cuba and Malaysia. Days after the execution, Jang's wife suffered her third stroke and died later. It contradicts Korean media reports she committed suicide five days after her husband's execution. North Korea watchers have speculated that Kim Jong Un's younger sister Kim Yo-jong, believed to be 26, may now end up playing the same leadership supporting role as her powerful aunt. This week, North Korea's official KCNA news agency listed her as a 'vice department director' in the powerful central committee of the ruling Workers' Party. She was pictured accompanying her brother on a trip to a cartoon film studio founded by their grandfather and the North's founding president, Kim Il-Sung.","Claimed Kim Kyung Hui died from stroke after arguing with Kim Jong Un .

In the absence of key playmaker Bojan Krkic, Marko Arnautovic’s set-pieces were a constant menace, Peter Crouch a constant threat. This was ‘old school’ Stoke according to Crouch who set up a goal for Ryan Shawcross inside two minutes, hit the post and had strong claims for a penalty turned down when Chris Smalling clearly handled his header in the second half. Radamel Falcao equalised for United who should have been grateful to get out of the Potteries with a point. Despite admitting that Stoke were the better team, however, Van Gaal was left frustrated with a third draw away from home over Christmas. ‘I’m not interested in a period of unbeaten, because I’m in a process,’ said the United manager. ‘We have to win away games and we didn’t do that.’ Van Gaal had complained about the demands of the festive fixture list in England, and his mood was not helped by the sight of Ashley Young limping out of his fourth game in 13 days with a pulled hamstring. Shawcross blows a kiss after giving Stoke the lead against Louis van Gaal's Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium .

Diouf was frustrated after he could and should have doubled Stoke's lead before Manchester United equalised in the 26th minute . Young is expected to be out for up to a month while United’s other first-choice wing-back, Antonio Valencia, did not even make the trip on Thursday because of a thigh strain. Van Gaal was even less happy with the way his team fell behind to a set-piece behind inside two minutes. Arnautovic fired over a corner from the right, Crouch rose above a static Luke Shaw to head goalwards and Shawcross was completely unmarked to turn and hook the ball home. ‘We’ve had two meetings about that,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We know that Crouch is doing that and they were totally free without any opponent in the neighbourhood so that was very bad.’ If there was one consolation for United, this was the kind of game they would have lost last season. In fact they did, a 2-1 defeat by Hughes’s side in February still their only loss in 14 Premier League encounters with Stoke. They lost Phil Jones and Jonny Evans to injuries before half-time that day, and both players had a bumpy ride alongside Chris Smalling in the first half here. Stoke used the wind to hang up long balls and asked Mame Biram Diouf and Crouch to chase down United’s back-three. Evans, in particular, almost paid for the price for allowing Arnautovic’s punt to bounce several times towards his own penalty box in the 19th minute, inviting Diouf to muscle him off the ball and go through on goal. It was an excellent chance for the former United striker to double Stoke’s lead but he curled a shot well wide of David de Gea’s goal.

Click here to read the full story . ‘He made a bit of a mess of it and I was thankful for that,’ admitted a relieved Evans. ‘The ball kept holding up in the wind and you had to break your stride sometimes to let it drop. I said to Mame Diouf, “Is it like this every week?” and he said it is.’ United were level seven minutes later and it infuriated Hughes that his old club scored from a corner of their own. Wayne Rooney swung over a cross from the left, Michael Carrick managed to flick the ball on and Falcao was lurking on the edge of the six-yard box to guide it past Asmir Begovic. It was the Colombian’s third goal in 12 games for United and, surprisingly, Carrick’s first Premier League assist since Boxing Day 2012. Van Gaal sent on Adnan Januzaj and Ander Herrera for Falcao and Shaw, but that was the precursor to a period of ferocious Stoke precious that should have brought a winner. After Jones was forced to head narrowly wide of his own goal, the resulting corner from Arnautovic picked out Crouch who headed goalwards. The ball clearly hit Smalling’s outstretched left arm from some distance but referee Michael Oliver waved away Stoke’s furious claims for a penalty.

Michael Carrick's flick-on for Falcao’s goal was his first Premier League assist since Boxing Day 2012. Moments later, Crouch beat Smalling to Arnautovic’s freekick and flicked a header towards the back post with De Gea beaten. Agonisingly, it came back off the post and Diouf’s follow-up effort went over the bar. ‘I think Stoke were closer to the victory with the ball on the post, and the first chance from Diouf was also not a little chance,’ conceded Van Gaal. ‘So they had two major chances and we didn’t create so much in spite of the time and space. ‘But it’s more difficult because we are not so tall. (Steven) Nzonzi is taller and Crouch is taller, so it’s not so easy. The opponent is always taller than us.’ So can we expect United to sign some taller players in the transfer window? ‘No,’ he replied. ‘We want to play another kind of football to Stoke City.’ Ashley Young is helped off in the second after as he is substituted after appearing to injure his hamstring at the Britannia .

"A 15-year-old girl who has fled Britain and flown out to join jihadis in Syria after being 'brainwashed' online may end up marrying an Islamic terrorist, a counter-extremist has warned. Schoolgirl Yusra Hussien, described as a grade-A pupil who wanted to be a dentist, left her family home in Bristol to join hardline fighters in the war-torn country. But a terror expert says she will most likely be told that she could best serve jihad by marrying an ISIS fighter. The devastating news emerged as Home Secretary Theresa May talked tough about the need to crack down on extremism. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirl Yusra Hussien, described as a grade-A pupil who wanted to be a dentist, has left her family home in Bristol to join jihadis in Syria after being 'brainwashed' online . A spokesman for Yusra Hussien's family said they were 'very distraught' and feared she might be 'in danger' Yusra, who is thought to have been exposed to jihadi propaganda on the internet, boarded a flight to Istanbul under the noses of police and border control officials at Heathrow. She is believed to be with a 17-year-old girl from Lambeth, South London, whom she arranged to meet at the airport, and to have flown to Turkey in order to enter Syria, where Islamic State fighters control large areas. Last night Yusra's distraught family, who are of Somali descent, begged her: 'Please come back. We miss you very much. You are not in any trouble. We just want you to be safe and to come home as soon as possible.' Haras Rafiq, an outreach officer for the counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, warned Yusra may have gone to become a jihadi bride. He said: 'We suspect what's happened is that she met up with somebody here in London, she travelled from Bristol to London, so she already had this romantic notion. 'She already probably believes that she's going to go and get married so one of two things will happen. 'It's more than likely that she will actually go and become a jihadi bride. She at the age of 15 will marry somebody who she considers to be a holy warrior. Yusra  left her home in Bristol, above, last Wednesday, and is now feared to be heading for Syria . Friends and family leaving Yusra's home in Easton where the schoolgirl's family are desperate for news . 'Either she will have a role to play in the so-called Islamic State. In this case she's not a professional - she's not a doctor, she's not an engineer etc. 'It's more than likely that she will actually go and become a jihadi bride. She at the age of 15 will marry somebody who she considers to be a holy warrior and that's how she will play a part in the jihad.' The teenager has not been seen since 7am last Wednesday when she left home in the Easton area of Bristol. Her parents thought she was going to school, but she is believed to have taken a coach to Heathrow. Her father Mohammed, a youth worker, only realised she was missing when he went to collect her from school that afternoon. He and his wife Safiya, a dinner lady, declined to comment further other than to confirm their daughter was missing. A woman who said she was Yusra's aunt added: 'We are all really confused.' Authorities fear the Bristol schoolgirl may be heading to fight with ISIS in Syria, above, after being radicalised . A family friend said the teenager, who wears a headscarf, had not asked for any money and her parents were unaware of any cash she could have used to pay for her flight – suggesting that whoever recruited her may also have bought her tickets. Afzal Shah, who spent time with the family at their home yesterday, said they had noticed Yusra use her phone and computer a lot recently. 'The family have not been able to make contact with Yusra,' he said. 'The understanding I have is that the radicalisation is self-radicalisation as opposed to any institution. 'There are so many forums and chatrooms on the internet that it's easy to be led astray. I don't know how she got to that stage but she was radicalised at that stage. 'It also begs the question how a 15-year-old child was allowed to board a flight like that.' Family spokesman Hibaq Jama said Yusra's parents were 'devastated - they have no idea where she is' Mr Shah said police believe Yusra may already be in the east of Turkey near the border with Syria. He added: 'IS is a menace to the whole of society and have nothing to do with the Muslim faith. They're violent and extortionist thugs. It's absolutely tragic. The family had no clue.' Anira Khokhar, speaking for the family, described Yusra as an 'intelligent, beautiful young lady. The family have lost a daughter and that is the most important thing here,' she said. 'They are just a family whose daughter is somewhere they are unaware of and she is in danger.' Another source close to Yusra's family said they feared she had become brainwashed on the internet. Up to 50 British girls and young women are feared to have gone to the Middle East to join the jihadis. It is claimed that Yusra was introduced to the London-based radical – who is also from a Somalian family – by a third girl, who is now being sought in Bristol. Family home: A neighbour said the Hussiens were 'a very nice family - the father is always there for his kids' Police were at Yusra's family home in Easton today as a family spokesman said they feared for her safety . Last night Avon and Somerset Police refused to explain how Yusra would have been able to fly without her parents to Turkey – a popular transit point for would-be jihadis - at a time of heightened security. It was unclear which airline Yusra and the other girl flew on, and what rules it has in place for unaccompanied minors. Louisa Rolfe, assistant chief constable of Avon and Somerset, said: 'Since she was reported missing by her parents we've carried out extensive work to trace her footsteps from the time she left home to her arrival in Istanbul. 'There are indications she may have been radicalised but at the moment our priority is to find her before she crosses the border to Syria and make sure she is safe.' She added: 'We must all be vigilant and ready to spot the signs of radicalisation. Often, young Muslims who go to Syria can be naive and don't recognise that they are being sucked into joining extremist groups.' Radicalised: Twins Zahra (left) and Salma (right) Halane, 16, ran away to Syria from their home in Manchester . Young Britons joining the extremists have also included Reyaad Khan (left), a former star pupil from Cardiff . Many of the British women who have gone to join IS are believed to be based at the group's stronghold in Raqqa, eastern Syria. Some are as young as 14 or 15, and travelling to marry jihadis, bear their children and join communities of militants. Twin sisters Zahra and Salma Halane, 16, left their Manchester home in July without their parents' knowledge to follow their brother to Syria. Both are reportedly now married to IS fighters. Experts say a small number of the women are taking up arms. Some British women and girls have posted pictures of themselves carrying AK-47s, grenades and in one case a severed head. Yesterday two police officers were standing guard outside The City Academy, Bristol, where Yusra is a pupil. Classmates say she is an A-grade student who has a very bright future and wants to be a dentist. A friend, 15, who had a history lesson with Yusra the day before she went missing, said she seemed 'completely normal'. 'I was sat next to her and she seemed fine,' she said. 'She didn't have any new friends that we knew about, and she was a completely normal girl.' Abdi Omar, 26, who lives next to the family's six-bedroom Victorian terrace, said the family's plight had been mentioned at the local mosque, which serves a predominantly Somali congregation.","Yusra Hussien reported missing by her parents from Bristol home last week .

"A new father has told how he dived 12ft to catch his newborn baby after his girlfriend suddenly gave birth on the toilet - despite having no idea she was pregnant. Karl Ford, 37, leapt into action after his partner Hilary Crump rushed into the bathroom with severe stomach cramps. He then called NHS 111 and spoke to a health advisor, who quickly realised Miss Crump's symptoms indicated she had just gone into labour. Surprise: Karl Ford dived 12ft to catch his newborn baby after his girlfriend Hilary suddenly gave birth on the toilet - despite having no idea she was pregnant . Just minutes later, she gave birth while crouching over the toilet but Mr Ford, an accountant, was forced to fling himself across the floor to catch the baby before he plunged into the bowl. An ambulance took the shocked couple, and their new 5lbs 1.5oz son Benjamin, to hospital. They were discharged six days later on February 22 and returned to their home in Malvern, Worcestershire. Miss Crump, 26, a care worker, had no idea she was pregnant and even lost weight before her unexpected birth. She had been taking the Pill and had not missed any periods. Unexpected: Mr Ford ended up delivering baby Benjamin last month - just after his mother had complained of stomach cramps . Mr Ford said: 'Hilary was crouching over the toilet and Benjamin tried to dive in head-first. I was about 12ft away so I had to move swiftly to dive and catch him' Mr Ford, a keen cricket fan, said: 'Hilary was crouching over the toilet and Benjamin tried to dive in head-first. According to studies, the phenomenon of surprise birth is not as rare as one might  imagine. Statistics show that one in 600 mothers-to-be will be unaware they are pregnant until they give birth, or just before. The situation tends to occur in busy women, those who may already be overweight, and those approaching the menopause. It tends to happen in menopausal women and younger busy women because they are not expecting to be pregnant and will not be looking for signs . Also, bleeding during pregnancy is common, especially during the first few months when the baby is bedding in, so women can think they are still menstruating. 'I was about 12ft away so I had to move swiftly to dive and catch him. 'It was a bit surreal, but I just launched myself like some kind of super wicket keeper into the air and caught him just before he fell into the toilet. 'You don’t think you will be able to cope, but when it happens, you just do it - you don’t have time to think. 'It was a bit of a surprise to be delivering my child.' Miss Crump said: 'I woke up at 3am and had cramps, took two paracetamol and went back to sleep. 'Then . I woke up at half four and the pain kept coming. I suppose looking back . it was textbook contractions, but you don’t expect it when you don’t . think you’re pregnant. 'I gave birth about 20 minutes after being on the phone to the NHS 111 woman. 'I was in the bathroom because I felt a pressure and didn’t know what was happening at first. I just said ""there’s something coming out of me"" and out he came in one big push. 'I was on the loo and I stood up with the pain so Karl had to run and jump to catch him before he went down the toilet. 'Our friends joke that we should have called him Louie.

"To the lonely would-be agent preparing for a mission behind Nazi lines, the glamorous Frenchwoman with the confiding manner offered the enticing prospect of some friendly female company. But the elegantly-dressed journalist who haunted the bars of upmarket hotels in wartime England was not all she seemed. ‘Marie Collard’ was an agent provocatrice employed by British spymasters to test out trainee agents before they were sent out to occupied Europe. And, as her official file released today reveals, she all too often succeeded in getting them to ‘spill the beans’ and blow their cover stories. Scroll down for video . Files: Marie Chilver in later life. She was an agent provocatrice employed by British spymasters to test out trainee agents before they were sent out to occupied Europe . After retiring from the service, Agent Fifi – as she was codenamed – lived quietly in the Forest of Dean, devoting her time to animal welfare and tending her garden. She died in 2007. Now nearly 70 years after the war, her existence as a spy has been confirmed. Her file is among 3,300 intelligence and security documents from the Second World War being made available for the first time online by the National Archives in Kew. Collard was not her real name, but part of an elaborate false identity created by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) – Britain’s Second World War sabotage organisation. Born Marie Chilver – the daughter of an English father and a Latvian mother – she first came to the attention of the SOE in 1941 after escaping from a prison camp in France and helping a badly-injured RAF airman escape back to England. Spies: The National Motor Museum at Beaulieu in the New Forest, where the Special Operations Executive (SOE) – Britain’s Second World War sabotage organisation - was located . She was given the job of testing trainees at SOE’s ‘finishing school’ at Beaulieu to see if they were capable of maintaining their cover stories. A report from October 1942 noted that she was perfectly suited for targeting trainees in ‘expensive or flashy hotels and bars’ to see if she could get them to talk – and all too often succeeded. One hapless agent, codenamed Parker, ‘never showed any signs of suspicion at all’, she reported. ‘Throughout the conversation he does not seem to have been aware that he was being questioned methodically and maliciously, although I tried to make it as obvious as possible.’ Fifi eventually began to feel sorry for those she had deceived with her ‘obvious and primitive trap’. ‘I am at times inclined to think the use of so malicious a ruse distasteful,’ she wrote. But she insisted there was an ‘absolute fairness’ to her methods, arguing that it would help trainee spies to ‘outwit all the Fifis they are likely to meet in their future career’. ‘Compared to what is most likely to happen in the field, it is very mild and innocent. It would be a pity to have to give up this method, because it does give the students a good chance of using their brains (or just their low cunning),’ she wrote. Trainees later got wise to her methods, and a report from September 1943 noted that many students ‘resist her blandishments’ and only open up when they realise the exercise is over. When MP Hugh Dalton was given the role of heading up the Special Operations Executive, Winston Churchill told him to 'set Europe ablaze' After France fell to the Germans in 1940, Churchill set up the Special Operations Executive (SOE), a new unit designed to operate with resistance movements behind enemy lines. The SOE was charged with bringing chaos and death to Nazi armies across the continent. When Hugh Dalton was appointed head of the organisation, Churchill told him to 'set Europe ablaze'. Operating out of two family properties on Baker Street, throughout late 1940 the SOE began recruiting new agents and purchasing properties across the UK to train them in. While the senior staff was almost entirely made up of Oxbridge graduates, the agents themselves included a chef, an electrician,  and the daughter of a Brixton motor-car dealer. Film-makers and makeup artists were installed at The Thatched Barn, a property in North London, to work on disguises, while at The Frythe, near Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire university graduates worked on ingenious weapons. Between them, these two teams created the single shot cigarette pistol, hollowed out tree trunks used to store radios, a camel dung roadside bomb, and carborundum - a grease designed to lock up the wheels of trains. By mid-1941, the SOE were operating inside France and their first real success came in June when they blew up the Pessac power station in Bordeaux, halting production at a German U-Boat factory and bringing the region's electric trains to a standstill. However, other security services were hostile towards the SOE. The head of the Special Intelligence Service branded them 'amateur, dangerous, and bogus'. Despite this mistrust, the SOE went on to prove vital to the war effort. In 1942 agents assassinated Himmler's deputy, Reinhard Heydrich, using a grenade. The same year they also destroyed the Gorgopotamos rail bridge, cutting Rommel's desert army off from reinforcements. The following year agents also destroyed the heavy water plant at Vemork, ending the Nazi atomic programme, and on D-Day in 1944 they used carborundum to halt trains bringing 2nd SS Panzer Division to the beaches. In total their attacks delayed the crack division by 17 days, by which time the Allies had gained a firm foothold in France. After the war the SOE was left without a clear role. Facing internal hostility from other security services, and with their biggest champion Winston Churchill voted out of office in 1945, the unit was disbanded in 1946.","'Marie Collard' posed as a French journalist and approached British spies .

"These are the heartrending images captured on the streets of Aleppo as rebels and the Syrian government battle for power. Rebel fighters have claimed President Bashar al-Assad's army has been forced into retreat, but on the frontline of the clashes, a grim picture of the bitter fighting can be seen. Rebels say they will turn Aleppo into . the 'grave' of the Assad government, and thousands have now fled, with those left running short of food and fuel and afraid for their lives. Ammunition: A Syrian rebel fighter loads an anti-aircraft machine-gun on an armoured vehicle in the northern town of Atareb, 25km east of Aleppo .

'I . would say 99.9 percent of the people aren't fasting. How can you fast . when you hear mortars and artillery hitting the areas nearby and . wondering if you will be next?' Syrian warplanes and shelling battered the country's biggest city today and heavy gunfire sounded from the Salaheddine district in the south-west of the city, which lies on a major road and has been the scene of some of the worst violence. Huge clouds of black smoke rose into the sky after attack helicopters turned their machine guns towards eastern districts for the first time in the latest bout of fighting - and a Russian aircraft later moved into the area.

The army claimed it had taken Salaheddine two days ago, but Syrian state television said today troops were still pursuing 'terrorists' there, suggesting the army does not have full control of the area. A rebel commander in Aleppo said his fighters' aim was to push towards the city centre, taking it 'within days, not weeks'. The rebels now control an arc that covers eastern and south-western districts. 'The regime has tried for three days to regain Saleheddine, but its attempts have failed and it has suffered heavy losses in human life, weapons and tanks, and it has been forced to withdraw,' said Colonel Abdel-Jabbar al-Oqaidi, head of the Joint Military Council, one of several rebel groups in Aleppo. Colonel Oqaidi said late last night that more than 3,000 rebel fighters were in Aleppo. The battle for Aleppo has become a crucial test for both sides in the 16-month-old rebellion, with both needing to win to give them hope over the wider struggle for Syria.

The fighting has proved costly for the 2.5million residents of Aleppo, a commercial hub that was slow to join the anti-Assad revolt that has rocked the capital, Damascus, and other cities. Makeshift clinics in rebel-held areas struggle to deal with dozens of casualties after more than a week of fighting. Up to 18,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Aleppo and many frightened families were seeking shelter in schools, mosques and public buildings, according to figures given by the UN refugee agency in Geneva. 'These are people that haven't fled the city as they haven't had the means or feel it is too dangerous to make that journey and we are getting indications that the journey is fraught with armed gangs and road blocks blocking the way,' said Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She estimated that around 15,000 to 18,000 people are displaced within Aleppo. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 100 people, including 73 civilians, were killed in Syria yesterday. It said five rebel fighters died during clashes with Syrian forces in Salaheddine. Rebel fighters patrolling parts of Aleppo in pick-up trucks flying green, white and black 'independence' flags face a daunting task in taking on the well-equipped Syrian army, even if the loyalty of some of its troops is in doubt. Hunger games: Syrians carry bags of bread away from a bakery in the northern town of Aldana near Aleppo . Short of supplies: Desperate families queue up for bags of pitta bread outside a bakery . The rebels are armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles, machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades, against a military that can deploy fighter jets, helicopter gunships, tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, artillery and mortars. Rebels have captured a small number of tanks and armoured vehicles but do not seem to have used them in combat yet. Against a background of divisions among major powers over Syria, US president Barack Obama and Turkish prime minister Tayyip Erdogan discussed in a telephone call how they could work together to speed up political transition in Damascus. Mr Erdogan's office said: 'They took up the co-ordination of efforts to accelerate the process of political transition in Syria, including Bashar al-Assad leaving the administration and the meeting of the Syrian people's legitimate demands.' Mr Erdogan, who once enjoyed close ties with Assad, has become one of his fiercest critics and has demanded he step down. Turkey hosts more than 44,000 Syrian refugees, many of them in border camps where they complain of poor conditions. Amid growing concern about security on its frontier, Turkey sent at least four heavily armed military convoys to the border with Syria on Monday, although there has been no indication that Turkish forces will cross over. The northern Syrian city of Aleppo has become a key focus for the fighting, with both Assad's army and the rebels desperate to win control. The commercial hub was slow to join the anti-Assad revolt that has rocked the capital, Damascus, and other cities, but now families are being forced to flee the violence and supplies are being cut off. Here is how events unfolded. July 20: Heavy fighting erupts in Aleppo, which has so far been largely spared the violence in a 16-month uprising. July 23: A rebel spokesman says opposition fighters have ""liberated"" multiple neighbourhoods of Aleppo, including Salaheddin in the south. July 25: Both the army and rebels send reinforcements to Aleppo. July 26: Fighting rages in several areas as troops and rebels prepare for a head-on confrontation. July 27: Helicopter gunships fire on several neighbourhoods. The rebels say they have captured 100 soldiers or members of the feared 'shabiha' militia in Aleppo. World powers call for 'maximum pressure' on the regime to prevent a massacre in the city. July 28: The military launches a dawn assault, using helicopter gunships, artillery and tanks as well as ground troops. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports 'the fiercest clashes of the uprising' as residents flee or take refuge in basements. July 29: Rebels say they have staved off a fightback by regime forces in Aleppo. The UN says 200,000 have fled the city in the past two days. July 30: Rebels seize a strategic checkpoint northwest of Aleppo after a 10-hour battle, securing free movement between the city and Turkey. The army has overrun part of Salaheddin district but is facing a 'very strong resistance', a security official in Damascus says. The rebels, however, deny that the army has advanced even 'one metre'. July 31: Overnight rebels launch attacks on a military court and an air force intelligence headquarters, along with a police station and a branch of the ruling Baath Party in a southern neighbourhood of Aleppo, a watchdog says. The Observatory says several neighbourhoods, notably Salaheddin, are shelled through the night by government troops. State television says 'the army is pursuing terrorist groups in neighbourhoods of Aleppo, inflicting enormous losses'. The Observatory says rebels overran two police stations in Aleppo, killing at least 40 policemen during fighting that lasted for hours.","Thousands have fled the violence and others are running low on supplies .

"A California judge threw out a 124-year prison term handed down a decade ago to an heir to the Max Factor fortune for raping three women and related crimes, ruling on Monday that the original sentencing had been improper. Andrew Luster will receive a new sentencing hearing in April but the judge declined to give the 49-year-old a new trial. Luster was convicted in 2003 in absentia of 86 counts including rape of an intoxicated person, rape of an unconscious person and sexual battery. He fled to Mexico during the trial. Also on Monday, bounty hunter Duane Lee 'Dog' Chapman, the man who captured Luster in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta, revealed that he got a vital tip-off about the fugitive's hiding place from Luster's own attorney, the late Richard Sherman. New hearing: Luster, left, is led out of the U.S. Customs building at LAX by FBI agents a day after being captured by Dog the Bounty Hunter in Mexico in June 2003 . Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor, was caught in 2003 by Chapman, in a development that helped propel Chapman to fame and his own reality TV show. The make-up heir ultimately sought a new sentencing hearing, and Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kathryne Stoltz ruled on Monday that the judge who sent him to prison for 124 years 'failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' rather than having them run concurrently. 'The previously imposed sentence is vacated and a new sentencing hearing will be held,' Stoltz wrote in her 28-page opinion that also denied him a new trial. The judge set an April 4 sentencing hearing for Luster. Attorneys for the Max Factor heir had argued he deserved one, in part because his original attorneys presented weak defenses at trial and that one lawyer, Richard Sherman, gave him ill-conceived advice to flee to Mexico. Bounty hunter and TV star, Chapman told Radar Online that Sherman gave him very useful clues as to Luster's location. Reality TV star: Dog the Bounty Hunter, pictured, caught Luster while he was on the run in 2003. Last month, he revealed that he was tipped off about Luster's location by the fugitives own attorney . As Radar Online reports, Sherman passed away in April 2011. The lawyer had always refuted the idea that he had given away his client's hiding place. But according to 'Dog' the attorney did give him the information, in a very subtle way. 'Sherman became very nice to me,' Chapman explained to Radar. 'We used to tease each other. And at one point he said to me, ""I’m going to tell you something Dog, so don’t be so dumb."" And then he said, ""The guy (Luster) speaks Spanish. Do you get it?""' The bounty hunter immediately understood. 'I had leads that pointed to Thailand and Mexico,' he said. 'Right then I dropped all my leads on Thailand and focused on Mexico.' Chapman captured Luster in June 2003 and was briefly jailed himself as bounty hunting is illegal in Mexico. Judge Kathryne Stoltz ruled last month that the judge who sent Luster to prison for 124 years 'failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' rather than having them run concurrently . On Monday, Stoltz wrote that Luster's attorneys did not fail him at trial, and she rejected his current lawyers' arguments that Luster was manipulated into fleeing. 'Although several witnesses did describe Luster as 'childlike,' it appears that this was primarily because he did not have to work at a regular job due to the fact that he had a trust fund, and he lived the life of a carefree 'beach bum,' Stoltz wrote. She added that Luster, who spent much of his time surfing, described himself as being involved in real estate and stock trading, and that he did not appear to have a low IQ. Luster was found guilty of giving three women the date rape drug GHB and raping them while they were unconscious or intoxicated. Video tape Luster took of his sexual acts with the women was presented against him at trial.","Andrew Luster, great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor, will get a new sentencing hearing for his 86 counts of rape but no new trial .

"Currently, around one in 100 children develops autism . Boys who have induced births are a third more vulnerable to autism, according to research. Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted, where drugs such as oxytocin are used to trigger labour. Researchers in the US analysed 625,042 live births linked with school records, including 5,500 children classified with autism. Babies whose births are assisted by induction or speeded up by drugs have a higher risk of developing autism, claim researchers . Girls were found to be at a smaller increased risk where medication is used to enhance contractions. But British experts defended induction saying its use outweighed  potentially fatal complications. Currently, around one in 100 children develops autism but symptoms do not usually become apparent until the second year of life. Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)  affects an estimated 600,000 children and adults in the UK. Researchers at Duke University . Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, found the risk of autism in boys . is between 15 per cent and 35 per cent higher. But the chances of an . assisted birth child developing autism remain very low, said their . report in journal JAMA Pediatrics. Two in 1,000 autism cases among boys . whose mothers experienced induced or augmented labour could have been . prevented, they found. Carol Povey, of the National Autistic . Society, said: ‘Autism is a complex condition and is thought to be the . result of many different underlying physical and genetic factors. ‘It’s therefore important that people do not jump to conclusions about this study and its implications.’ Autism, or autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), including Asperger’s syndrome, is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone’s ability to interact socially and communicate. An estimated 600,000 children and adults in the UK are affected by ASD and genetic factors play a role in its development. The study found induction or the use of drugs to affect the rate or strength of contractions (known as augmented) were linked with a higher risk of autism being diagnosed in childhood. Researchers led by Simon Gregory of Duke University Medical Center, Durham, found the risk ‘particularly pronounced’ in male children. Researchers in North Carolina analysed 625,042 live births linked with school records, including 5,500 children classified with autism, over an eight-year period (stock picture) The risk of autism in boy babies who had an induced or augmented labour is between 15 per cent and 35 per cent higher than for those who do not, the exact amount depending on whether the labour was induced, augmented or both. In the case of boys, both raised the risk of autism whether used together or individually. Only augmentation alone was associated with an increased risk among girls. The study allowed for factors such as socioeconomic status, maternal health, pregnancy-related events and conditions, and birth year, says a report in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. But the actual chances of a child developing autism after assisted birth remain very low, said the researchers. Researchers  from Duke University, Durham, North Carolina found the risk 'particularly pronounced' in male children . Two in 1,000 autism cases among boys whose mothers experienced induced or augmented labour could have been prevented if their births were unassisted. Further work is needed to investigate the reasons for the link, they said, but it does not justify changes in clinical practice. Co-author Dr Chad Grotegut, also from Duke University, said ‘The findings of this study must be balanced with the fact that there are clear benefits associated with induction and augmentation of labour. ‘Labour induction, especially for women with post-date pregnancies or medical conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, has remarkably decreased the chance of stillbirth.’ Prof Kevin McConway, Professor of Applied Statistics at The Open University, said there was evidence autism is linked with risk factors associated with ‘a difficult birth’. Prof Kevin McConway, Professor of Applied Statistics at The Open University . But the effect of these risk factors is quite small - about 13 in 1000 boys in the study were recorded as having autism - and it is far from clear what is causing what, he added. ‘If, magically somehow, all the mothers of boys who had induction or augmentation could have not had it, while everything else remained the same, then the number of their children with autism diagnoses would reduce by only 2 in 1000. The association in girls is even weaker, too small to be of statistical significance’ he said. Prof McConway said ‘Maybe something else - some genetic factor, or something that occurred earlier in pregnancy or during the birth that the researchers could not take into account - is causing some babies to be more likely to have an induction of labour and separately making it more likely that they have autism. ‘We can’t just stop doing inductions or augmentations. As the researchers very clearly point out, there are very large benefits to the mother and to the baby in appropriate cases. ‘Even if it turns out that we could save a few children from autism by inducing many fewer labours, that would come at a major cost in other complications, including deaths to mothers and babies. ‘There’s certainly nothing here that pregnant women or new mothers should be particularly concerned about, in my view. The researchers make it explicit their work gives no reason to change medical practice, and I absolutely agree with them on that.’","Boys third more at risk following a ‘difficult’ birth, according to US study .

"Jailed: Dana Amin, 33, from Mitcham, South London, has been jailed for his part in the 'honour killing' of Banaz Mahmod in 2006 . A cousin of an honour killing victim who helped dispose of her body has said he is proud of his actions. Banaz Mahmod, 20, was strangled to death with a shoelace by her father and uncle in her south London home, seven years ago. Her cousin Dana Amin, now 29, helped put the . young woman's body in a suitcase and transported it to the Midlands before burying it in a make-shift grave in a . Birmingham back-garden. As he was sentenced to eight years in prison, Amin told Southwark Crown Court he did not regret his actions. Iraq-born Banaz was murdered by members of her family because she walked out of an arranged marriage and fell in love with another man. Her father, Mahmod Mahmod, and uncle, . Ari Mahmod, were jailed for life in 2007, after being found guilty of what has become Britain’s most notorious honour . killing. On the eve of Banaz's death, Amin, a father-of-one, joined two other cousins, Mohammed Ali, and Omar Hussain, who were jailed in 2010 after being extradited from Iraq, at the former's Brixton home to discuss plans to kill her. Although none were convicted of Banaz's murder, the cousins later travelled to Birmingham in Amin’s black Lexus to help their uncles get rid of the 20-year-old's body. Banaz’s case highlighted the occurrence of honour killings in Britain, after her body was discovered in the Brimingham garden, three months after her disappearance. The young woman's nightmare began three years earlier, when she . agreed to an arranged-marriage to a Kurdish man, then . aged 28, who she later told police was ‘very strict'. She had met her . husband-to-be only three times before her wedding day and, according to . Banaz, her husband regularly . physically and sexually abused her. ‘When . he raped me it was like I was his shoe that he could wear whenever he . wanted to,’ she explained to police. ‘I didn't know if this was normal in my . culture, or here. I was 17.’ Murdered: Banaz was strangled to death with a shoe lace in her home in South London by her father and her uncle before three cousins were called in to help dispose of her body . Murder: The body of Banaz Mahmod was found inside this suitcase, three months after she has been buried in a Birmingham garden by three of her own cousins . The terrified young woman left her husband after two-and-a-half years, a decision that angered her family, who had arrived in Britain when Banaz was 12. After returning to her family home, she met and fell in love with Rahmat Sulemani, a family friend. Rahmat . would later give evidence at the trial, revealing that he and Banaz had . been threatened with death if they carried on seeing each other. The . mobile phone footage he took of Banaz when she was lying covered in . blood in a hospital bed, in an apparent earlier attempt to murder her, . was shown at the 2007 trial. The . lovers pretended they had parted after the shocking incident, but they . continued to meet in secret. They were spotted together in Brixton on . January 21 and the Mahmods were informed. Rahmat was kidnapped by four men who threatened to kill him. In fear of her life: Banaz Mahmod is seen telling officers that she believes her family intend to murder her during a police interview. She was killed in January 2006 . Harrowing: Banaz visited police five times asking for help, but nothing was done in time . When he phoned Banaz to warn her, she went to the police and said she would co-operate in bringing charges against her family and other members of the community. The . policewoman who saw Banaz tried to persuade her to go into a hostel or . safe house but she is thought to have seen her home as safe because . her mother was there. She returned to the family home and was murdered just days later. Despite denying any involvement in the plot, Amin was convicted by a jury yesterday following a week-long trial. Judge Martin Beddoe slammed the ‘perverted code’ followed by the killers which dictates a woman cannot do as she chooses. He told Amin: ‘I am quite satisfied that you knew well before she was murdered what was going to happen to your cousin.' Killers: Banaz's father Mahmod Mahmod, right, and her uncle Ari Mahmod, left, were jailed for life in 2007 . Jailed: Mahmod Mahmod was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his daughter . Judge . Beddoe added: 'Her . death had been planned for about a month or so before it actually took . place. There had even been an attempt on her life already. ‘I . am sure you were aware of all these matters and you knew not only of . what had gone on but what was intended to happen. I fear for any female . child you may father. ‘When I think of that girl in that suitcase in that hole . in the ground, I find it really hard to consider your family situation. ‘It is a reflection that you are again thinking of yourself and demonstrating a complete lack of remorse.’ Amin, . of Mitcham, south London, denied doing acts tending and intending to . pervert the course of public justice and preventing the lawful and . decent burial of a corpse. He . is about to become a father for the second time, and the court was told . he plans on joining his wife and sons in Iraq after he has served his . time.","Banaz Mahmod, 20, was murdered by her father and two others in 2006 .

"Dan Harris: The cyclist was described as having a 'warmth and passion for life' A cyclist killed by an Olympic bus took to the roads only because he feared the Games would cause public transport chaos. Dan Harris, 28, was dragged under the wheels of a double-decker at a notorious junction in the shadow of the velodrome at the Olympic Park. The internet consultant began commuting on his racing bike a week earlier after telling friends he was fed up with delayed trains. He was the tenth cyclist to die in the capital this year despite millions of pounds being ploughed into making the roads safer. The tragedy came just hours after Bradley Wiggins raced to victory and said he hoped his achievement would encourage more to take up the sport. But after learning of the death, the gold medallist reignited the debate over the safety of cycling in cities. He said the Government should make helmets compulsory and road users should ‘give and take’. He added: ‘London is a busy city and there’s a lot of traffic. It’s got a lot busier since I was riding a bike as a kid round here, and I got knocked off several times.’ Yesterday an emotional account emerged from a fellow cyclist who was riding alongside Mr Harris, seconds before he was dragged under the bus in Hackney, close to the Olympic Park Velodrome. The eyewitness, who has not revealed their name, posted a message on the Reddit community blog detailing the tragic moment they saw the accident. The post read: 'The lights changed as he was in the buses blind spot and as he was attempting to go straight the bus turned left. He didn't really have anywhere to go and no time to do anything anyway.' Scroll down for video .

'Make helmets compulsory': Bradley Wiggins calls for an overhaul of road safety laws after a cyclist was killed by an Olympics coach close to the Velodrome just hours after he won gold in the time trials yesterday . Shocking: The accident occurred outside the Olympic Park, in Hackney, close to the Games' Velodrome, hockey pitch and Paralympics' tennis arena, as foreign journalists were being transported to another venue . The death toll for cyclists killed in the UK is at least 60 after the death of the 28-year-old man last night. 11 of these occured last month. Among them was Kyle Coen, 14, who was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Kent on Monday when he was cycling to meet his girlfriend. Another teenager was killed last week. Kadian Harding, 14, was hit by a Mercedes Sprinter van when on a family bike ride in Marlborough. Kadian was pronounced dead at the scene after failed attempts from paramedics and his family to rescue him. An inquest was opened on Friday into the teenager's death. No arrest was made of the 32-year-old driver, who suffered from severe shock. Last year 16 cyclists lost their lives in London, and - including the man who was killed yesterday - ten have died on the capital's roads this year. Daniel Cox was hit by a lorry in Dalston, and died at the Royal London Hospital. The message continues: 'As soon as the . bus was definitely stopped i crawled under to him from the other side . and i was immediately aware that i didn't think he'd make it.' The . poster then describes how they crawled up to the collision victim and . comforted him, adding: 'I asked him his name and told him he was going . to be alright. He didn't say anything because i don't think he could, . but he looked straight at me. 'I . did my best to look him straight in the eyes and tell him he was going . to be ok. He was so afraid. Maybe half a minute later i could tell he'd . passed.' Mr Harris was on . his way home to Wanstead, East London, when he was crushed by an . official bus ferrying media around the outskirts of the Olympic Park on . Wednesday evening. Another . cyclist rushed to his aid, but the IT worker, who had recently moved in . with his long-term girlfriend, died at the scene. Campaigners . said the junction on the A12, in Stratford, was ‘badly designed’ and . criticised the closure of a safer canal towpath during the Games for . ‘security reasons’. The bus driver, a 65-year-old man, was arrested and . questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving before . being released on bail. Mr . Harris’s Italian girlfriend, advertising worker Cecilia Dominici, was . too upset to speak as she was comforted by friends yesterday. She posted a picture of herself with her boyfriend online with the words: ‘More than anything in this world.’ Damaged: The man's bike lies mangled next to the Olympic bus which hi collided with . Tragedy: An officer stands watch near the scene of the crash, which happened as Wiggins was preparing to speak at a press conference at the Olympic Park . Safety call: Wiggins said the Government should be 'legalising helmets to make them the law to wear' as he he admitted he had been knocked off his bike on London¿s 'dangerous' streets . Mr . Harris’s employer, Moo.com, said: ‘There are no words to express how . much we’ll all miss him, and his infectious enthusiasm, warmth and . passion for life.’ It is . not known if Mr Harris was wearing a helmet, but last night David . Cameron said making them compulsory was under review. He said: ‘It’s a . difficult issue. 'There is a strong case for making them compulsory but . when this was last looked at the decision was made not to do that . because there are some who take a different view, that it would . discourage cycling and it wouldn’t reduce the level of accidents.’ Rescuers and police stand at the scene after Dan Harris was killed after colliding with the bus .

"The White House pressured its allies to provide pro bono legal aid to unaccompanied minors today. With Congress out of session and legislation to provide emergency funding to immigration agencies stalled, the White House is leaning on immigration advocates to help provide legal services to immigrant children going through deportation proceedings. The White House hosted approximately 60 law firms and nonprofits today to discuss ways groups can help reduce the burden on the government and make sure unaccompanied minors receive legal counsel. The situation at the border is 'the single most significant, heart-wrenching and divisive thing that’s happening in terms of the immigration debate right now,' Vice President Joe Biden told attendees. The White House hosted approximately 60 law firms and nonprofits today to discuss ways groups can help the government provide unaccompanied minors with legal counsel. 'We need trained lawyers' to help determine which kids should receive refugee status, Vice President Joe Biden told them . According to the White House, fewer than half of illegal immigrant children have proper legal representative, putting them at a disadvantage when they appear before immigration courts. Already the White House has deployed a government program to train lawyers and paralegals to represent children facing deported, but immigration groups say the program will affect a small portion of minors scheduled to appear in court. Since last October a surge of more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors have illegally entered the United States and the federal government expects as many as 90,000 to arrive at the border by the end of the year. Children who identify themselves as Mexican can be immediately sent back to their home country, but those coming from non-contiguous countries to the U.S. must be afforded due process before they can be repatriated. Courts now face a backlog of more than 375,000 immigration, including those of unaccompanied minors, and illegal immigrants wait up to three years for a hearing. The governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have asked the U.S. to make a special exception in refugee laws for children coming from their countries due to the prevalence of violence.The White House has resisted those efforts, however. 'If the measure we’re going to use as to . whether or not asylum is granted is if you’re better off in America than . you are someplace else, well there’s at least 800 million kids who are . eligible,' Biden told immigration advocates today. 'That’s where you all come in,' he told attendees. 'We need lawyers, we need trained lawyers, to determine whether or not these [illegal immigrant] kids meet the criteria for refugee status.' Biden said he understood it's 'going to be really hard' to pick and choose which children deserve to stay, but it must be done. 'I wish I had a more perfect solution,' he told them, noting that even comprehensive immigration reform wouldn't solve this problem. This June 25 photo shows a group of immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally as they are stopped in Granjeno, Texas. The U.S. has seen a surge of Central Americans illegally entering the country throughout the last year . The Obama administration has promised to speed up deportation hearings and administration officials have expressed interest in changing the law to allow Central American children - who make up the bulk of new arrivals - to voluntarily return home, as most will not qualify for refugee status under current law. But immigration advocates and many . Democrats have come out in staunch opposition to the initiatives because . they reduce immigrant children's access to the court system. In July the American Civil Liberties Union, American Immigration Council, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, Public Counsel, and K&L Gates LLP filed a class-action lawsuit against the government for not providing illegal children with legal representation. 'If we believe in due process for children in our country, then we . cannot abandon them when they face deportation in our immigration . courts,' Ahilan Arulanantham, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU's . Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. 'The government pays for a trained prosecutor to advocate for the . deportation of every child. It is patently unfair to force children to . defend themselves alone.' In an emergency funding request to Congress in July the White House requested $15 million for legal representation for children in immigration proceedings. Democrats in the Senate revised the White House's request upward to $50 million, but that bill died in the Senate just before it left for August recess. A Republican bill approving additional border spending cut funding for lawyers for immigrant children out in its entirety. That bill passed the House late last Friday and awaits action in the Senate when members return next month. President Barack Obama has said he would veto that bill because it did not adequately fulfill immigration agencies needs. Just as the flare up on the border the White House announced $2 million in grants for a federally funded public defender program for illegal immigrant children that will be managed by the Department of Justice and the Corporation for National and Community Service, the agency that oversees AmeriCorp. The program will provide for 100 lawyers and paralegals for children under the age of 16 who are have already received a notice to appear before the court. A  spokesperson for the Corporation for National and Community Service told the New York Times in June that 'the program has been in the works for a really long time' and while consistent with the administration's goal to provide representation to newly arriving illegal immigrant children, it was part of its response to the border crisis. 'A hundred lawyers nationwide is not going to satisfy our commitment to protecting these children,' Jonathan Ryan, executive director of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, told the New York Times after the administration announced the program. 'If we have to give lawyers to murderers, then perhaps we should give them to refugee orphans.' Likewise, Kristen Jackson, a senior staff attorney with non-profit law firm Public Counsel, one of the group's suing the Department of Justice, said there's not enough lawyers who are willing to represent illegal children to for free, however. 'Each . day, we are contacted by children in desperate need of lawyers to . advocate for them in their deportation proceedings,' Jackson said in a statement supporting the class action suit. 'Pro bono efforts . have been valiant, but they will never fully meet the increasing and . complex needs these children present.' Only with additional financial aid from the government will illegal immigrant children receive the legal help they need, she argued. 'The time has come for our . government to recognize our Constitution’s promise of fairness and its . duty to give these children a real voice in court.'","The White House hosted 60 law firms and nonprofits today in an effort to get more immigration groups to provide free legal aid to illegal children .

"Disgraced former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer is reportedly dating a press secretary for Mayor-elect Bill De Blasio - and has been spotted having late-night liaisons at her Manhattan apartment. Spitzer, 54, who is still married to wife Silda, has been pictured slipping into the home of 31-year-old Lis Smith, who recently worked on his failed bid for New York City Comptroller. The former governor, who resigned in 2008 after admitting he had paid thousands of dollars for high-class prostitutes, was seen twice last week arriving at Smith's Soho apartment, taking her to a candle-lit dinner, then disappearing back upstairs. Eliot Spitzer, left, has been seen at the apartment of Lis Smith late at night then leaving before dawn last week. She worked as Spitzer's campaign spokeswoman during his failed bid for New York City Comptroller . Silda Spitzer stood by her husband Eliot's side as he admitted to using high-class prostitutes and resigned in 2008. The couple announced their marriage is over on Christmas Eve . The New York Post snapped pictures of Spitzer arriving around 10pm two nights in a row last week, then leaving before dawn. The disgraced politician was seen dashing from the building shortly before 6am before hopping in a cab a few streets away. On one occasion, the pair walked together from the apartment to a nearby restaurant, the cozy French bistro Le Pescadeux. The manager of the restaurant told the Post that the couple were regulars, adding: 'The first time I saw Spitzer, I didn’t know if he was Eliot Spitzer or Anthony Weiner. Those two are like the same exact guy.' After the romantic meal, the couple were seen entering Miss Smith's apartment building together. Spitzer and his wife Silda remain married five and a half years after the scandal that cratered his meteoric political career. However, . multiple reports indicate that he and Silda have been living apart and Mrs Spitzer was noticeably absent from the campaign trail this past year. Spitzer and his alleged girlfriend Lis Smith were seen slipping into the romantic French bistro Le Pescadeux last week for a late-night dinner before heading back to her nearby apartment . Miss Smith joined De Blasio after Spitzer lost in the September primary. She has also served as the spokeswoman for the Mayor-elect during his transition. The Daily News reports that Miss Smith is a frontrunner to become De Blasio's press secretary after he is formally sworn in. In 2012, she led the 'rapid response team' on President Obama's reelection campaign. Spitzer . has repeatedly refused to comment on his personal life and says he is . only staying at his parents' apartment because they are in poor health. A former colleague of Miss Smith's told MailOnline: 'Lis is one of the best political operatives in the country and her private dating life is not going to change any of that. Her accomplishments stand on their own.' Miss Smith refused to directly comment about whether or not she is in a relationship with . the disgraced former Governor. Spitzer has been named as a possible . presidential candidate before a federal investigation revealed him as . 'Client 9' of Emporer's Club VIP, which ran $1,000-an-hour call girls.

"A father-of-three died from a burst blood vessel the day after being discharged from hospital with Gaviscon to treat heartburn, an inquest heard. Daren Hooper, 42, was rushed to hospital after collapsing at work and was diagnosed with gastro-oesophageal reflux and given antacids as treatment. But doctors failed to carry out a CT scan which might have spotted that a leaky artery was slowly filling his chest with blood, the hearing was told. Project worker Daren Hooper is pictured here with his wife Kath. He had suffered with digestive problems for the past decade. He collapsed at his home in Ruishton, Somerset, less than 24 hours after being discharged and died en route to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton. Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Michael Rose said that ‘not enough consideration’ was given to his diagnosis and that a CT scan could have saved his life. The inquest in Taunton, Somerset, heard how Mr Hooper had suffered from gastrointestinal problems for more than a decade. Three days before he died the project manager collapsed at work and was rushed to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. He was diagnosed with gastro-oesophageal reflux and - despite suffering from severe chest pains - was not given a CT scan that may have spotted any damage to his aorta. Mr Hooper collapsed at home on January 16, 2012, where his young son Archie called an ambulance. He went into cardiac arrest en route to Musgrove Hill hospital in Taunton and neither the paramedics nor the emergency resuscitation team at the hospital were able to revive him. His wife Kath, who was with him in the ambulance, told the inquest: ‘I was leaning over Daren and his eyes went. They just went.’ A post mortem examination recorded . his death to be haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aortic aneurysm - a . massive amount of blood which filled his chest. The . aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and a rupture is a . catastrophic medical condition which carries just a three per cent . survival rate. Mr Hooper was sent home from the Bristol Royal Infirmary with antacids after he collapsed at work . The inquest heard evidence from five doctors who treated him at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Dr James Ritchie was a junior doctor at the time and flagged up the possibility Mr Hooper's condition may have been more serious than originally thought. He told the inquest: 'I considered the possibility of aortic dissection. ‘I asked the nurse to check Mr Hooper's blood pressure in both arms and I checked that his right and left pulses were equal in volume and synchronous, which they were.’ He added: ‘I was aware that these were possible signs of aortic dissection but I was unsure how reassuring the normal findings were.’ Dr Ritchie and senior medic Dr Alasdair Macrae checked the chest x-ray, which showed no sign of aortic aneurysm or dissection - where part of the lining of the aorta breaks apart and splits inside the artery. Mr Hooper, a project manager at a property firm, was given Gaviscon during his stay in hospital, the inquest heard. Mr Hooper diagnosed with gastro-oesophageal reflux and given Gaviscon during his stay in hospital, the inquest heard . Coroner Mr Rose said: ‘This is a tragic case. The deceased, Daren Mervyn Hooper, was 42 years of age and I would hope he would have a good life ahead of him. ‘My assessment is I feel not enough consideration was given to what admittedly is a rare but not impossible consideration that something had gone wrong with the aorta. ‘We do not think that full consideration was given to the actual matters that subsequently led to his death. ‘When he was discharged from hospital, he was not the man his wife knew two days earlier."" Ruptured aortic aneurysms in the chest affect only one in 100,000 patients, but the chances of suffering one are dramatically reduced with age. Mr Hooper was in an age bracket where the NHS see perhaps only two or three cases a year, the inquest was told. Mr Rose added: ‘Had the consideration that Mr Hooper was suffering from an aortic leak been fully considered, a CT scan would have been conducted. ‘His leaking aortic aneurysm would have been discovered and this may have led to successful surgery.’ Speaking after the hearing, Mr Hooper's wife Kath said: ""I am satisfied that today's inquest has acknowledged that there are some serious issues for the . Trust to address following the death of my husband. ‘Expert opinion states that his death could have been avoided if he had been given a CT scan when he visited Bristol Royal Infirmary. ‘Indeed, the doctor dealing with him raised the possibility of such a scan but was informed by a senior that it wasn't necessary - that fateful decision has completely devastated my family. ‘It hasn't been helped by the minimal psychological support offered for myself and my children. ‘I will now campaign for better support for bereaved parents and children who really need it to help them rebuild their lives.’ Mr Hooper is survived by his wife Kath and their three children, Joseph, 15, Archie, nine and Darcy, four. Kath's solicitor Andrew Hannam commented after the case: 'We will now consider our options in terms of pursuing this matter further with the objective of securing the kind of support the Hooper family deserve to help them cope without a husband and a father. ‘Meanwhile, it is important to point out that this tragic event has been investigated thoroughly by the Trust who accepted that Darren Hooper's death was regarded as a Serious Untoward Incident. ‘The Serious Untoward Incident investigation has resulted in training for staff at Bristol Royal Infirmary to ensure this 'knowledge gap' is closed and these circumstances don't occur again.'","Daren Hooper, 42, was rushed to hospital after collapsing at work .

"Turn-off: Keeley Hawes and Ed Stoppard as aristocratic Hollands . It was billed as the BBC’s big-budget fightback in television’s  Sunday night ratings battle. The Corporation hoped its lavish new version of Upstairs Downstairs would serve up the same sort of success enjoyed by ITV’s country house saga Downton Abbey. But after two series it seems the BBC has admitted defeat – axeing the revived period drama because of falling ratings. Yesterday it was confirmed that there would not be a third series after more than two million viewers turned off between the first  episode and the last. The decision comes despite attempts to ‘sex up’ the plot with  the introduction of lesbian archaeologist Dr Blanche Mottershead, played by ER and Moll Flanders star Alex Kingston. She was seen in bed with her bisexual lover, played by Emilia Fox. But the move failed to pay off, and fans criticised Upstairs Downstairs for its incredulous and at times far-fetched storylines. In one episode, future US President John F.  Kennedy visited Sir Hallam’s London townhouse for  a dinner party and fell ill after getting drunk. Other sensational storylines involved beautiful but troubled Lady Persie, younger sister of Lady Agnes, who was played by Claire Foy. In the space of six episodes she managed to seduce her sister’s husband, give secrets to the Nazis and shoot a maid with a pistol. She later died when she plunged off a balcony. Upstairs Downstairs was revived in 2010 after 40 years off screen, and when a second six-part series began in January it drew 6.5 million viewers. But within a week 700,000 had switched off and by the time the series ended last month, just 4.45 million were watching. When the finale of Downton Abbey’s second series was broadcast in November, 10.5 million viewers tuned in. A BBC spokesman said yesterday: ‘2012 has been a great year for BBC drama but at this stage there are no plans for Upstairs Downstairs to return.’ Lavish: Despite great expense being spend on costumes and sets, the modern version of Upstairs Downstairs was not a ratings winner . Reborn: Upstairs Downstairs came back onto television screens in 2010 after a 40 absence, but rating soon started to slip . The drama, which follows the lives of the ‘upstairs’ residents of 165 Eaton Place in London and their ‘downstairs’ staff, was the brainchild of veteran actresses and best friends Dame Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh – who played housemaid turned housekeeper Rose Buck in the original series first screened on ITV in 1971. Axed: Lady Portia Alresford, played by Emilia Fox, Dr Blanche Mottershead, played by Alex Kingston were introduced to 'sex up' the plot . Dame Eileen and Miss Marsh teamed up again in 2009 to work on a revival for the BBC. The new version was set a few years after the original as London prepared for the Second World War, and starred Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes as aristocrats Sir Hallam and Lady Agnes Holland. The commission was widely seen as a response to the success of Downton Abbey, set in a Yorkshire stately home and following the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family. Stars include Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary and Jessica Brown Findlay as Lady Sybil. Upstairs Downstairs has failed despite lavish sets and a big-name cast, including former Spooks actress Miss Hawes, Jewel In The Crown star Art Malik and veteran Anne Reid. The first series struggled to match the ratings of its ITV rival when it aired over Christmas 2010. However, the BBC commissioned a second series that began in January this year. Upstairs Downstairs was hit by further setbacks when co-creator Dame Eileen quit the series last August, two months before filming began, amid claims she was unhappy with the direction producers had taken her character Lady Maud Holland. The 77-year-old Dame said last night: ‘I think it’s sad it’s not going on but you can’t blame the cast, who were wonderful.’ There was another blow when Miss Marsh, 77, was forced to scale back her involvement after suffering a minor stroke. Miss Marsh – the only cast member to appear in both the original series and the revival – eventually appeared in just two scenes during the six episodes.","Upstairs Downstairs was revived in 2010 .

"President Barack Obama tonight made it clear that he wanted the UK to remain 'strong, robust and united', in a dramatic intervention just 24 hours before the referendum. In a statement posted on Twitter, the leader of the United States called the UK 'an extraordinary partner for America' and 'a force of good in an unstable world'. The message, posted by the White House official Twitter account, was signed 'bo' - Barack Obama's initials - which means that the message was worded by the President himself. Scroll down for video . The statement posted by the White House is signed 'bo', which means it was worded by the President himself . Barack Obama, pictured at an event today, does not want Scotland to break up the United Kingdom because the US has a 'deep interest' in keeping it together . White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr Obama wanted Britain to remain 'strong, robust, united and an effective partner of the United States' His comments come after Bill Clinton told Scots to reassure 'a world torn by identity conflicts' by voting No in an 11th-hour intervention in the independence debate. The former U.S. president said he was reluctant to express his view before now because he appreciated the decision was 'Scots alone to make'. But he said uncertainty over currency and the impact of 'long, complex' negotiations had convinced him to urge the people of Scotland to keep the Union. His views were published in a statement released today by the Better Together campaign. President Obama's statement reiterates one he made earlier this week, when he urged Scottish voters not to break apart ‘one of the closest allies we’ll ever have’ by voting for independence on Thursday. The dramatic intervention, just three days before Scotland goes to the polls, would have infuriated Alex Salmond - with the battle for independence set to be decided by the smallest of margins. Up to half a million voters remain undecided - with concerns over the future of Scotland’s place in major international organisations like the EU, Nato and the UN still hotly debated. Mr Obama’s spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday: ‘From the outside, the United States has a deep interest in ensuring that one of the closest allies we'll ever have remains strong, robust, united and an effective partner of the United States.’ The remarks came after Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed Scotland would have to reapply to join the military alliance - and stressed that to do every members would have to agree. 'Extraordinary partner': President Obama said that the UK is a 'force of good in an unstable world'. Above, Prime Minister David Cameron today . He said: ‘In case that Scotland voted in favour of independence then Scotland would have to apply for membership of Nato as a new independent state. A decision on accession would have to be taken by unanimity, by consensus as always in Nato.’ The double salvo against independence comes amid warning that the US would vigorously oppose the Alex Salmond’s plan to move Britain’s Trident nuclear submarines from the Clyde after independence. Britain’s nuclear capability is key strand of Nato’s military defence and any threat would spark fury in Washington. Earlier this year Mr Obama used the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings to praise the United Kingdom and warn against Scottish separatism. Speaking alongside David Cameron, Mr Obama said: 'I would say that the United Kingdom has been an extraordinary partner to us. ‘From the outside at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well.' The British people will make the ‘right decision’ in an in-out referendum, he said. ‘We obviously have a deep interest in making sure one of the closest allies we will ever remains a strong, robust, united and effective partner.’ Mr Obama added: ‘Whenever our two nations stand together, it can leave a world that is more secure and more prosperous and more just. ‘On that day, like so many others, American and British troops stood together and fought valiantly alongside our allies. ‘They didn't just help to win the war, they helped to turn the tide of human history and are the reason that we can stand here today in a free Europe and with the freedoms that our nations enjoy. ‘Theirs is the legacy that our two nations and our great alliance continue to uphold and I'm grateful to have a fine partner in David in making that happen.’ Earlier this week, David Cameron urged Scots not to vote for independence in a speech to Better Together supporters in Aberdeen today . President Barack Obama's intervention will have delighted the Prime Minister, who is battling to save the union . Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond - at Edinburgh Airport  in Edinburgh today - has previously made light of US criticism of Scottish independence . Mr Salmond attempted to make light of the remarks at the time. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Salmond said: ‘America had to fight for its independence. We are very fortunate in Scotland that we have a democratic, agreed, consented process by which we can vote for our independence. ‘So, in summary, I suppose my message to President Obama is “yes we can”.’ Mr Obama is not the first world leader to have spoken out against independence. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott last month said: 'As a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it’s hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent Scotland.' Genealogists believe they can trace Mr Obama’s ancestry to William the Lion, who ruled Scotland from 1165 to 1214. A maternal ancestor of Mr Obama, Edward FitzRandolph, is said to have emigrated from Scotland to America in the 17th century. The First Minister has never met Mr Obama but did invite him attend the 2009 Homecoming Festival, although he did not get a reply. The President led international condemnation in 2009 of the decision by Mr Salmond’s administration in Edinburgh to free the Lockerbie bomber and allow him to return to Libya to a hero’s welcome.","US President's intervention comes just one day before the referendum .

"A former soldier who was injured by a Taliban explosive in Afghanistan has said he was refused entry to a pub because of scars on his face. James Dalby, 23, was serving as a trooper in the Royal Dragoon Guards in 2010 when he was caught in the blast from an improvised explosive device. The blast left him with third-degree burns, a broken leg, a fractured eye socket and shrapnel wounds to his head. The injuries were so serious he had to leave the Army for medical reasons. Refused entry: James Dalby, who was scarred by a Taliban bomb in 2010, says a doorman told him his wound 'looks bad'. He is pictured left training in Dorset before the blast, right today . Mr Dalby and a group of friends were turned away from a Yates's pub in York on a night out last Saturday - though Yates's has claimed it was for breaching their dress code. The former soldier has described how he was singled out from his party and told he could not come in because his wound 'looks bad'. He said: 'I got refused from Yates's for something I can't control. I was not drunk and I wasn't being disorderly, I wasn't giving him a reason to target anything. 'It would be nice to get a public apology and for people to be aware that it goes on. That was my job and it was not my call to make. 'To be refused for being an ex-serviceman with facial scars does anger me.' Location: Mr Dalby and his friends were turned away from Yates's pub in York, pictured . Solidarity: Yates's has claimed that the group was denied entry for breaching a dress code, but Matt Rayner (pictured right with Mr Dalby) said he was dressed similarly to his friend and allowed inside . Locals in York have reacted angrily to his treatment and threatened to boycott Yates's in response. Hundreds of people have signed up to a protest in York planned for April 26. Representatives of the pub chain, which has more than 60 locations across the country, said that the entire group was turned away because they failed to meet the dress code, which includes a weekend ban on hoodies and sportswear. A spokesman claimed that Yates's welcomes service personnel and has given substantial amounts to forces charities. Support: Hundreds of Facebook users voiced their anger, and have signed up to a protest in York later this month . 'Despicable': Other soldiers rallied round Mr Dalby after the incident at Yates's . But Mr Dalby and his friends have disputed that this was the reason, claiming that the doorman eventually admitted their clothes were not the real reason. Matt Rayner, 25, was a member of the group and said: 'Everyone was disgusted by it. Of the group that was out, everyone was allowed in apart from James. He was not dressed any differently to me. 'James is a quiet lad and is not the most confident, something like this is going to knock his confidence. I just think it's wrong.'","James Dalby, 23, was scarred by while serving in Afghanistan in 2010 .

"Former Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali urged Christian Girl Guides to continue to fight plans to scrap the promise to 'love my God' A Former Bishop yesterday urged Christian Girl Guides leaders to  continue to fight plans  to scrap the promise to ‘love my God’. Michael Nazir-Ali, formerly Bishop of Rochester, said they should follow the example of ‘rogue’ leaders who are defying their national HQ’s controversial orders. From next month youngsters will instead promise to ‘be true to myself and develop my beliefs’ after it was decreed the old promise could discourage new members from joining. However, a group of Guide  leaders in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, are resisting adopting the new promise, saying the organisation has ‘God at its core’. Bishop Nazir-Ali said: ‘If there are others like this group – indeed I would hope that there are many others like it – why should they not be allowed to continue to have a reference to God? If these people really believe in diversity they would allow them to do that. Why should they face  expulsion from the Girl Guides movement which is rooted in the Christian faith?’ Warning the row could lead to a split in the Guides as a whole, he added: ‘Ultimately if there is not going to be any diversity permitted, these people may need to group together in a way that they can support one another.’ Hazel Mitford, who runs St Paul’s Girl Guides in Harrogate, Brownie leader Jayne Morrison and Alison Ellison, who runs the Rainbows for younger girls,  criticised the change in a letter to a local newspaper. A decision was made in June to replace the allegiance to God with the words 'be true to myself and develop my beliefs' (file picture) They said: ‘Girlguiding has God at its core and anyone who has issue with this is free to start their own organisation.’ Their . stance prompted an atheist leader who recently joined their group to . enlist the National Secular Society to help her ensure the new, secular . pledge is adopted, arguing she is acting in the interests of ‘feminism’. Jem . Henderson, 28, who was a Guide as a teenager and calls herself a . ‘post-punk, feminist poet’, joined the Harrogate group in June after . hearing about the secular promise. But . she claims other leaders’ ‘insistence on keeping the old promise’ excludes her and atheist girls from joining the troop ‘or asks us to lie . when making the promise’. She . added: ‘It is just unfortunate that there are little bastions of people . who are actually wrong about the Guiding movement – they think it is . based on God but actually it is based on girls. A mention of vowing to love or serve God has been included in the Promise since the Guides began in 1910. This picture shows a hail for the Queen from some of the 4,000 Girl Guides at the World Guide Camp in Windsor Great Park in August 1957 . ‘My motivation is feminism and community based. This is a clash between the old promise and the new.’ The . National Secular Society, has written to Girlguiding UK seeking . clarification that all groups will be required to use the new promise. Yesterday . Mrs Mitford, who has been a guide leader for more than 20 years, met . with other senior leaders in a bid to ease tensions. She said: ‘I’m part of this  fantastic organisation which changes girls’ lives. ‘But . this is turning into something very destructive and I’ve no desire to . get into a shouting match with the National Secular Society.’ Chief Guide Gill Slocombe said: ‘When members make their Promise after September 1 the new Promise must be used. ‘Whilst . all leaders will need to accept this change as we go forward, we will . be talking with leaders who are anxious to help them resolve any . difficulties. ‘We sincerely hope it won’t be necessary for anyone to leave the organisation.’","Decision made in June to abandon the old promise to 'love my God'

"The police union paid a PR firm for advice on using ‘guerrilla tactics’ against ministers just weeks before the Plebgate scandal. The media strategy also called for a military-style ‘blitzkrieg’ to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers. The secret plot was laid down in a £10,000-a-month contract handed to the public relations company by the Police Federation. The revelation will worsen relations between the union’s officials and the Conservative Party, which believes Andrew Mitchell was ‘stitched up’ in the September 2012 Plebgate affair. The revelation about the Police Federation's PR 'guerrilla' campaign will worsen relations between the union's officials and the Conservative Party, which believes Andrew Mitchell was 'stitched up' in the September 2012 Plebgate affair. The media campaign was a response to Home Secretary Theresa May’s hardline approach . The former chief whip has always denied calling Downing Street police officers ‘****ing plebs’, insisting the row was hijacked by Federation officials for political ends. Representing 125,000 rank and file officers, the union was furious at Home Secretary Theresa May’s hardline approach to the reforms. And, just months before Plebgate, Federation bosses signed up for the services of Jon Gaunt, who is a former newspaper columnist and radio DJ, and his brother Jason. The contract stated Mr Gaunt’s firm would be paid £10,000 a month to undertake a campaign using ‘guerrilla tactics’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ against government police pay reform. The deal lasted only two months but Mr Gaunt continued to provide PR advice to three branches of the federation in the Midlands, all central to the ‘Plebgate’ storm. Just months before Plebgate, Federation bosses signed up Mr Gaunt's firm for £10,000 a month to undertake a campaign using 'guerrilla tactics' and 'blitzkrieg' against government police pay reform . Three delegates from West Midlands, West Mercia and Warwickshire met Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office near Birmingham. Afterwards they claimed he refused to provide an account of the incident – their tough stance adding to pressure that later saw him quit the Government. Mr Gaunt went to the meeting with the three officers, who were later heavily criticised by the Commons home affairs committee. Their federations had previously mocked the Government and the chief whip by printing 'PC Pleb' T-shirts. MPs have claimed Mr Gaunt leaked details of the private meeting to the media. And a secret recording made by Mr Mitchell showed he had apologised for swearing at the Downing Street officers and denied using the word ‘plebs’. Last year, national Federation officials discussed whether a copy of the ‘guerrilla tactics’ contract should be sent to the home affairs committee, which was investigating Plebgate. A row erupted when the decision was made not to do so. Today, a whistleblower, who claims she was unfairly dismissed after raising concerns about the Federation, is expected to be questioned about the agreement by the Commons committee. Fiona McElroy has spoken of a ‘vocal minority’ who resisted her efforts which were, she claims, ‘undertaken in good faith and with encouragement, mostly in the absence of any strategy, guidelines, policy or support’. Miss McElroy’s testimony comes after a key witness to Plebgate claimed the Federation exploited the affair. In February, Ian Richardson, one of the four police officers on duty at the time, said he believed Mr Mitchell called the officers ‘****ing plebs’ as claimed in the original police log. But the former officer added that although Mr Mitchell’s behaviour was officious and rude, he did not deserve to lose his job in government over a ‘quirky incident’. He condemned the Federation for stirring up the case against the politician, who he felt was treated ‘like tethered prey’ in the days before he was forced to resign. The former chief whip has always denied calling Downing Street police officers '****ing plebs', insisting the row was hijacked by Federation officials for political ends. Pictured, a still from CCTV footage capturing the alleged incident . A secret recording made by Mr Mitchell showed he had apologised for swearing at the Downing Street officers and denied using the word 'plebs' He also said the officers at the gate were undermined by colleagues in the Met’s diplomatic protection group who leaked the log of the incident and by the actions of PC Keith Wallis, who has been jailed for 12 months for lying about witnessing the incident. Last night the Federation refused to answer questions about its media contract with Gaunt Brothers. A spokesman told the Mail: ‘In 2012, the Police Federation of England and Wales contracted Gaunt Brothers to assist with a communications campaign around the likely effect on public safety of government budget cuts to policing. ‘The contract was terminated after two months and the company has not been used by the national Police Federation since. ‘The Home Affairs Committee are aware that the Police Federation used Gaunt Brothers. Owing to commercial sensitivity, it would be inappropriate to discuss the details of the contract.’ Former Sun columnist Mr Gaunt, 53, the son of a police officer who has been hailed as ‘the monster who roars for coppers’ on the website of the Metropolitan Police Federation, also refused to discuss the contract. He said: ‘I had a contract with them but obviously it’s confidential. There was a confidentiality clause.’","The Police Federation paid a PR firm for a media strategy over police reforms .

"Ed Miliband has been told to 'stop banging on about the bedroom tax' or face losing voters in the South ahead of the election . Ed Miliband must stop ‘banging on about the bedroom tax’ or risk losing the election in the South of England, senior Labour figures have warned. Candidates from key target seats across the South staged a revolt during a private meeting with Mr Miliband – telling him that Labour will lose unless it adopts a more ‘aspirational’ message. The warning came as the Labour leader was accused of reverting to class war with the release of a party political broadcast depicting the Conservatives as bullying, out-of-touch toffs who have reduced Nick Clegg to a cowering figure. The campaign film, a parody of a 1950s B-movie, features actors playing Coalition ministers with caricature posh voices. However it was quickly criticised as ‘childish’ after its release online last night. Outside London, the Opposition now has just 10 MPs in the South of England, compared to more than 50 in Tony Blair’s landslide victory  in 1997. Many senior Labour figures believe the party cannot win next year’s election unless it tackles the perception that it only cares about its Northern heartlands. Mr Miliband invited 20 candidates from target seats in the South to a private meeting in London last month to discuss how the party could improve its performance. But instead of a general discussion about tactics and party machinery, the event quickly turned into a showdown over Mr Miliband’s divisive Left-wing agenda. A source at the meeting said candidates were in despair at the leadership’s relentless anti-austerity message and urged him to change tack. ‘People were very clear that we have to start saying less about austerity and more about aspiration,’ the source said. ‘We have got to stop banging on about the bedroom tax and the North-South divide because those messages are not going to win for us in the South.

Labour leader Ed Miliband was accused of reverting to class war with the release of a party political broadcast depicting the Conservatives as bullying, out-of-touch toffs who have reduced Nick Clegg to a cowering figure . ‘In fairness to Ed he did listen. I think he does get it, but it’s just too easy for us to fall back into our comfort zone.’ Last week one of Mr Miliband’s closest allies warned publicly that Labour was in danger of losing the election in the South. Senior Labour MP John Denham, a former aide to Mr Miliband, said Labour was ‘not on the agenda for most southern voters’, adding: ‘We have got to do better because otherwise we will do worse.’ Senior Labour MP John Denham, pictured, a former aide to Ed Miliband, said Labour was 'not on the agenda for most southern voters' Mr Denham blamed his Labour colleagues, who ‘despite my best  efforts ... insist on talking about a North-South divide’. Mr Miliband yesterday appeared to accept the criticism but insisted that his focus on the cost of living would reap dividends in the South. He said: ‘Mr Denham speaks a lot of sense about the challenges for Labour right across the South. ‘But we have a very important message for people across the South – the cost of living crisis affects them too, particularly issues like rent levels.’ Another shadow minister told the Daily Mail that the economic recovery meant the party needed to broaden its message on the economy from the cost of living crisis. He added: ‘If the election was tomorrow I’d be quite confident. But it’s not, so I’m worried.’ Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle also issued a coded warning to Mr Miliband not to focus solely on the party’s core vote. She told the Huffington Post website: ‘I’m not a “one more heave” offer person ... We must aspire to win with a big majority.’ Labour also defended its political broadcast – which is entitled The Uncredible Shrinking Man and does not mention any Labour policies – as a light-hearted attempt to make a serious point about the role of the Lib Dems in the Coalition ‘propping up’ the Conservatives.","Ed Miliband told to 'stop banging on about bedroom tax' or face losing votes in the South .

"Mystery has deepened around the eight-tonne Earth-observing Envisat satellite after the satellite fell silent - and has failed to enter the 'safe mode' expected of ailing space vehicles. In 'safe mode', it would use its power to angle its solar panels towards the sun. Without it, it could fail permanently. Scientists and engineers are scrambling to pinpoint the problems afflicting the satellite - radar images from Earth appear to show that it's intact. If no other solution is found, a high-resolution imaging satellite, Pleiades, will scan the craft on Sunday. 'After 10 years of service, Envisat has stopped sending data to Earth. ESA's mission control is working to re-establish contact with the satellite,' says the European Space Agency . 'We continue to try to re-establish . contact with the satellite, and to collect more information on the . satellite's status by ground radar images, from optical images, from . telescopes, but also from other spacecraft,' said Professor Volker . Liebig of ESA. The satellite failed to radio to its . controllers on April 8 - and a team of engineers, scientists and mission . operators are now attempting to restore contact with the satellite. ""On Sunday, will try to program the satellite Pleiades to see if they . can image Envisat, to give us more detailed knowledge on whether there . is damage on the outside,' he said. 'After 10 years of service, Envisat has stopped sending data to Earth. ESA's mission control is working to re-establish contact with the satellite,' says the European Space Agency. 'The first sign that there was a problem came on 08 April when contact with the satellite was unexpectedly lost, preventing the reception of any data as it passed over the Kiruna ground station in Sweden.' The . eight-tonne Envisat had a planned lifetime of five years, but has . doubled that - and the European Space Agency has celebrated the . anniversary with a gallery of the unforgettable imagery captured by . Envisat's eight sensors. More than 2,000 scientific publications have been based on Envisat data. Envisat's data has been used in 4,000 science projects in 70 countries, including landmark research into climate change.Its study of ocean currents was used last year to simulate dispersal of nuclear pollution from the Fukushima accident, and it gained real-time images of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

"A multi-millionaire who believes California should be separated into six separate states has been granted permission to collect petition signatures calling for his plan to be put to the vote. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, 55, says the Golden state is too large to govern efficiently, and that people living there would be better served by a more localised government. The technology investor has proposed splitting the state into six: San Diego and Orange County would become South California, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara would make up West California, the Sacramento area would be known as North California, and Bakersfield, Fresno and Stockton would make up Central California. Proposals: Venture capitalist Tim Draper, 55, believes California should be separated into six separate states to enable the region to be governed more effectively . Silicon Valley would be made up of San Francisco and San Jose, while Redding and Eureka would form Jefferson. More than 38 million people call California home, making it the most populous state in the US, and if it was to be its own country it would boast the world's eighth largest economy. California is also the third largest state by area, taking in almost 164,000 square miles of coastline, mountain ranges, several huge cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego, and desert. Were his plan to be implemented Mr Draper, who . made his name, and some of his fortune, investing in Skype and Hotmail, . would find himself living in the Silicon Valley state as he lives in .

'It is more and . more difficult for Sacramento to keep up with the social issues from the . various regions of California,' he told ABC News. 'With six Californias, people will be . closer to their state governments, and states can get a refresh.' However, critics of the scheme have . raised concerns about changes to issues such as agricultural policies . and the voting system, as well as how the state's assets, and problems, . would be shared out. Urban: The state is home to several huge cities, including Los Angeles which has a population of 3.85million . Diverse: California covers almost 164,000 square miles - from densely populated cities to the desert, such as Death Valley .

"One of the finest eulogies for Robin Williams was written years before his untimely death by one of his closest friends, fellow actor Christopher Reeve. In 1995, Superman star Reeve was facing a life or death situation as he prepared to undergo an operation at the University of Virginia Medical Center to reattach his skull to his spine following a devastating horse-riding accident. With his chances of survival rated just 50/50, Reeve later told Barbara Walters that he ‘wanted to die’ until his despair was lifted by an unexpected visit from his old friend Williams. Scroll down for video . Closer than brothers: Robin Williams and Christopher Reeve attempt to hail a taxicab in New York City in 1981. The pair shared a enduring friendship until Reeve's death in 2004 . After Reeve's horse-riding accident in 1995, he revealed it was his good friend Williams paid him a surprise visit that raised his spirits in his darkest hour . In his 1996 autobiography Still Me, Reeve recalls how Williams showed up at the hospital pretending to be an eccentric Russian proctologist who was going to perform a rectal exam on him. ‘I lay on my back, frozen, unable to avoid thinking the darkest thoughts,’ wrote Reeve. ‘Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent. He announced that he was my proctologist and that he had to examine me immediately. ‘My first reaction was that either I was on way too many drugs or I was in fact brain damaged,’ wrote Reeve. Reeve and Williams pose backstage at the People's Choice Awards in March 1979 as they both started to enjoy success with Superman and Mork and Mindy respectively . ‘For the first time since the accident, I laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay.’ By then the pair were indeed old friends, having first met more than 20 years before as roommates at the prestigious Julliard School in New York City. In 1973 the budding actors were the only two students accepted to the advanced program at the school. In several classes they were the only students. Williams was also the first student that Reeve met at university and he recalls watching Williams 'in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways.' Their strong bond lasted way beyond college as their respective careers took off in the late 70s, with Williams enjoying massive television success in Mork and Mindy and Reeve staring in the 1978 blockbuster Superman. During a Reddit AMA last year, Williams recalled his favorite memories of Reeve. ‘Him being such a great friend to me at Juillard, literally feeding me because I don't think I literally had money for food or my student loan hadn't come in yet, and he would share his food with me,' he wrote. 'And then later after the accident, just seeing him beaming and just, seeing what he meant to so many people.’ Reeve’s widow Dana once described the pair as being ‘closer than brothers’ and it was rumored that Williams had helped pay for Reeves’ treatment following his accident. He also became actively involved in Reeve's foundation, The Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. Reeve died in 2004 after a cardiac arrest. ‘The world has lost a tremendous activist and artist, and an inspiration for people worldwide. I have lost a great friend,’ said Williams after his friend passed away. Reeve's widow Dana once described the pair as being 'closer than brothers' and it was rumored that Williams had helped pay for Reeves' treatment following his accident . The next year Williams dedicated his Cecil B. Demille Award at the Golden Globes to his old friend. 'Miss you. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,' he said. For his dedication and support as an advocate for the Reeve Foundation, the charity honored him in 2007 at a gala in Los Angeles. After the announcement of Williams’ suicide on Monday, the charity posted a tribute to him on its website. ‘While the world knew Robin Williams as an Oscar-winning actor, we knew a different side to the man whose smile was as big as his heart. 'While our hearts ache with the loss of our friend, it is unlikely Robin would want us to mourn his passing with silence, but to celebrate his life through laughter. 'Together, let's remember Robin for the man who made the world laugh.'","One of the most treasured relationships of Robin Williams' life was his enduring friendship with fellow actor Christopher Reeve .

"It's a pain locking a bike when popping into a shop for a few minutes – especially when you know you’ll be fumbling for your keys minutes later. But the key is set to become a thing of the past now that designers have created a Bluetooth padlock that can be unlocked simply by hovering a smartphone nearby. The padlock, which resembles a traditional one, is the first to allow users to open a lock without keys using an iOS or Android app. Scroll down for video . No more keys! The Noke padlock by Fuz (pictured) claims to be the first to allow users to open a lock without keys, instead using an iOS or Android app (also pictured). The device allows people to share a bike, for example, protected by the lock . To work the ‘Noke’ lock, a user must press the shackle when they and their phone are nearby. ‘Noke wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone. If the phone is within a few feet, Noke will instantly unlock so you can be on your way. No need to launch an app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse,’ the company wrote on Kickstarter. It uses signals sent via Bluetooth to a smartphone to identify the owner of the lock and in this way will also allow people to share their lock – so two people could access one bike, for example, either temporarily or permanently. Hardy: The Noke lock (pictured in pieces) It is made from hardened steel and boron and has a long-life battery that lasts for a year with continuous use . No more fumbling for keys: ‘Noke wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone. If the phone is within a few feet, (illustrated) Noke will instantly unlock so you can be on your way. No need to launch an app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse,’ the company said . The Noke padlock connects via Bluetooth with an iOS or Android app to automatically identify the owner of the lock. To unlock Noke, users simply have to press the shackle. It wakes up and searches for a phone and if it senses the handset is within a few feet, it instantly unlocks so users don’t even have to take their phone out of their pocket. The app allows instant and secure sharing so users can choose to let another person temporarily or permanently access their bike – or whatever the padlock is protecting. It can also be opened if a user learns a sequence of clicks – so it works a little like a combination lock without numbers. Utah-based design company Fuz Designs created the smart padlock to solve the problems associated with traditional padlocks and keys, which are easy to lose, can be stolen and are hard to share. The device weighs just over eight ounces (227 grams) and is designed to be used with a cable for bikes, as well as securing sheds. It is made from hardened steel and boron and has a long-life battery that promises to last for a year with continuous use. If a user’s phone, or the lock’s battery dies, they will be able to use ‘quick click’ technology to access the lock, allowing them to key in a sequence of pre-determined clicks manually using the shackle. Co-founder of the company, Cameron Gibbs, 35, said: 'Noke is roughly the same size as a traditional padlock. Secure: The device weighs just over eight ounces (225grams) and can be used with a cable for bikes, as well as securing sheds (illustrated) Smart: The lock will send signals via Bluetooth to a smartphone to identify the owner of the lock and in this way also allows people to share their lock – so two people can access one bike, for example (pictured) 'It is 3.3 inches (9cm) tall and 2.2 inches (6cm) wide and weighs about eight ounces. 'There is no interference with other Bluetooth devices. Noke doesn't unlock until you wake it up. It won't ever unlock on its own.’ The firm is currently raising funding on Kickstarter and has smashed its $100,000 (£62,000) target, pulling in over $500,000 (£310,106). The lock is available to pre-order for $59 (£37) with a shipping date in February, but will retail for around $89 (£55). Noke's creators claim their smart lock is secure. It can only be unlocked when a user's smartphone is hovered within feet of the device. A user can turn off the auto-unlock feature so it will not be accidentally unlocked if they are nearby. It uses Bluetooth 4.0, which contains the highest level of security, according to the firm. Bluetooth 4.0 uses a 128-bit AES CCM encryption algorithm and the designers have added their own PKI technology and cryptographic key exchange protocol to prevent the device being hacked. The main threats come in the way of 'traditional theft' as a thief could steal a smartphone and use it to unlock a bike, for example. The lock is also designed to be shared, meaning people must choose their friends wisely or risk their valuables being stolen, despite the smart padlock.","Designers created the 'Noke'  to eliminate  the old-fashioned key and lock .

"President Barack Obama will unveil the United States' strategy to overthrow Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria in an address to the nation on Wednesday, an interview with the president that aired on Sunday revealed. 'We are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum of . ISIL, we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities, we're . gonna shrink the territory that they control, and ultimately, we're gonna . defeat them,' Obama said in an interview for NBC's Meet the Press on Saturday. The president said he would meet with lawmakers on Tuesday to give them the opportunity to weigh in on his plans before making a formal announcement the following day. Scroll down for video . FINALLY: President Barack Obama said in an interview with Meet the Press that aired this morning that he would reveal his strategy to take down Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria in an address on Wednesday . In previewing his strategy to NBC, Obama acknowledged that there would be a military component to taking down the religious extremists and it would 'require some resources ... above what we are currently doing.' But the Commander in Chief swore he was taking the country to war. 'I'm preparing the country to make sure that we deal with a threat from ISIL,' he said. 'This is not going to be an announcement on about U. S. ground troops,' he promised. 'This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war.' 'The notion that the United States should be putting boots on the ground would be a profound mistake,' Obama NBC. The U.S. does not have the resources to 'serially occupy various countries all around the Middle East,' he said. 'And at some point we leave, and then things blow up again,' he added. 'So . we've got to have a more sustainable strategy. 'The . boots on the ground have to be Iraqi. And in Syria, the boots on the . ground have to be Syrian,' he said. The president said other countries in the Middle East, namely Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, also need to lend a helping hand in Iraq. After speaking to other world leaders at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit last week, Obama said he feels confident there's a broad coalition of countries both regionally and internationally who are willing to play a role in the fight against ISIS. Without going into detail about his own plans, Obama indicated that the U.S. would be helping Kurdish forces come up with a plan to reclaim the territory ISIS has taken over in Iraq. 'There's going to be an economic element to this. There's going to be a political element to it. There's going to be a military element to it,' Obama said of his blueprint for victory. Kurdish peshmerga fighters take up position as their tanks (not pictured) shell Islamic State controlled areas at the Khazir front line leading to Mosul on Sunday. U.S. President Barack Obama said on the same day that the U.S. would give the Kurds a blueprint for destroying ISIS . Fishing for additional details, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked the president if Americans should read anything into the date of his upcoming speech - September 10, the eve of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 'We have not seen any immediate intelligence about threats to the homeland from ISIL,' Obama assured him. 'That's not what this is about.' Obama said he just wanted to make sure Americans know the government is on top of the situation in Iraq. 'More than anything I just want the American people to understand the . nature of the threat, and how we're gonna deal with it, and to have . confidence that we'll be able to deal with it,' he declared. Todd also pressed Obama during the interview on his comment earlier this year that ISIS was the equivalent of a junior varsity basketball team. Obama denied to Todd that he ever characterized the barbaric, Islamic extremist group that way. 'I wasn't specifically referring to ISIL,' he said. 'I've said that regionally there were a whole series of organizations that were focused primarially locally, that weren't focused on the homeland,' he claimed, noting  that ISIS, also known as ISIL, was 'not yet' a threat comparable to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and his terrorist group Al Qaeda. 'I was very specific at that time,' Obama continued. 'What I said was not every regional terrorist organization is automatically a threat to us that would call for a major offensive.' Obama's decision to share his grand plan to confront ISIS follows a verbal gaffe late last month at a press conference during which the president admitted he did not yet have a strategy to confront ISIS in Syria. Since then, lawmakers from both major political parties have been pressing the president to clearly explain how he plans to decimate the violent terrorist group.","Obama said he'll meet with lawmakers to discuss his plans on Tuesday before sharing them with the nation on Wednesday .

President François Hollande described the killing as a 'horrific tragedy' The attack took place around 9am at the school in the Lapanouse area of the town which has 284 pupils aged from three to 11. The murderer fled the scene of the crime, and evaded arrest for 20 minutes before police found her near her home. The victim’s time of death was 11am. Ms Derens said the identity of the attacker would not be released at present, but that she was aged 47 and had a police record. The mother was last year spoken to by police about neglecting a child under 15, and attempting to delay a search for a missing child. She is currently in custody, where she is likely to remain until a criminal trial sometime next year, when she will face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of murder. France’s Education Minister Benoit Hamon said the whole of France was ‘deeply shocked’ by a crime which came at the end of the school year. He said it highlighted the need to improve security in schools. President Francois Hollande also condemned a ‘horrible tragedy’. President François Hollande described the killing as a 'horrific tragedy' and despatched Education Minister Benoit Hamon to the school. A government spokesman said: 'All state services will be mobilized to look after the students and the personnel who witnessed this horrific tragedy.' There have only been four known cases of teachers being killed in class in France over the past three decades. French Education Minister Benoit Hamon said the whole of France was 'deeply shocked' by a crime which came at the end of the school year . The last was in 1995 when 51-year-old English teacher Michel Antoine was beaten to death in the south west town of Dax by two students, one of whom had just failed his exams. Both murderers ended up serving ten years in prison. In October 2012 a father was sentenced to three years in prison, with 18 months suspended, for hitting a Lyon gym teacher with a truncheon. The latest killing came as France's national statistics agency, Insee, revealed that 12 percent of teachers and other education staff had suffered threats and other forms of abuse in class.A further 0.6 percent reported actual physical attacks.","Killing took place on the morning of the last day of term .

"Ben Rudolph, an official Microsoft Windows phone evangelist, offered to 'upgrade' Android users to a Windows phone if they complained about bad experiences with Android malware . Microsoft's Windows Phone Evangelist has made a surprising offer - free Windows Phone handsets for people who complain publicly about Android on Twitter. Ben Rudolph, who Tweets as BenThePCGuy, said, 'Share your android malware story (there's lots going around) and you could win a Windows Phone upgrade.' The Tweet was retweeted by an official Microsoft Twitter account, and Rudolph is a prolific Twitterer for the company, so the offer appears to be genuine. What wasn't clear was how many phones were on offer, and what exact models. Tech sites such as Electric Pig were quick to speculate that Nokia's glamorous new Lumia 800 handset would be the phone Microsoft would send out. Users swiftly duly in with complaints about brand-new phones deleting content. The hashtag suggested by Rudolph - #droidrage - failed to become a trending topic on Twitter, however. Some users also joked about the whole idea, 'The worst thing about Android is the jealousy that it creates with Microsoft lovers and Micrsoft evangelists without a pint of decency.' The Tweet came a day after a new plague of Android malware hit Google's Android Market - this time, with viruses 'posing' as popular games such as Angry Birds and Need for Speed.

"David Anderson said the Prime Minister’s plan to stop jihadis returning to the UK had ended up being ‘nothing like as dramatic’ as claimed . David Cameron announced policies without first working out how to implement them, the chief reviewer of terror laws claimed yesterday. In a stinging rebuke, David Anderson said the Prime Minister’s plan to stop jihadis returning to the UK had ended up being ‘nothing like as dramatic’ as claimed. The QC argued that the exclusion orders – announced amid great fanfare in September – should really be called powers of ‘managed or controlled return’. In most cases, fanatics will simply be required to agree to a curfew, regularly visit a police station or attend a de-radicalisation course. Mr Anderson’s comments came as the Government unveiled its much-trailed Counter Terrorism and Security Bill. Documents released alongside the legislation show officials expect to seize 50 passports from suspected jihadis intending to travel to Syria or terrorist training camps every year. The Home Office also predicts that 15 fanatics will be placed under T-PIM terrorism prevention measures, under which they can be put into internal exile and forced to live 200 miles away from their associates. The Bill also contains: . Two months ago, after the threat of a terrorist attack was raised from substantial to severe, Mr Cameron pledged new laws to bar jihadis from returning from Syria. But the plan was quickly savaged by MPs and legal experts for being unlawful since it would effectively leave British citizens stateless. In the final version, it has been downgraded to a system of exclusion orders, lasting a maximum of two years.

Mr Anderson, who was appointed by the Home Office to scrutinise all counter-terrorism legislation, said of the Prime Minister’s original plan: ‘I sense that this was an announcement waiting for a policy.’ He told a committee of MPs and peers he believed it had soon become clear that such a move would ‘neither legally nor practically’ work and the plan was now for a system of ‘managed return’. Mr Anderson added: ‘My impression is also that, frankly, the policies announced on September 1, some of them were well thought through and well worked out and well prepared, others not so much. ‘What we now have is a power that although entitled exclusion orders, or temporary exclusion orders, I think in reality it is much closer to managed return or controlled return.’ Amnesty International called the powers ‘draconian’, adding that none of the measures seemed well grounded.","David Anderson derided PM's plan to stop jihadis returning to the UK .

"The U.S.-led coalition has struck targets of the Islamic State group near a besieged Kurdish town in Syria near the border with Turkey, activists said. It is not clear if the airstrikes halted the militants' advance on Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab. The town currently hosts thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing ISIS' murderous advance. More than a million have flooded over the border into neighbouring Turkey. Scroll down for video . A Syrian Kurdish family waits after crossing the border between Syria and Turkey yesterday. Tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds flooded into Turkey fleeing an onslaught by Islamic State . Innocent: A child cries as Syrian Kurdish refugees arrive at the border. More than a million Syrians have taken shelter in neighbouring Turkey . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit Islamic State fighters east and west of Kobani. The Local Co-ordination Committees, another activist group, confirmed the air strikes on the town's outskirts. Kobani has been under attack by IS since mid-September. Despite US-led air strikes, the militants were able to advance towards the town over the past few days. The Observatory said fighting around Kobani yesterday killed 57 fighters on both sides - the town's Kurdish defenders and ISIS militants. In the last week alone, more than 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the Islamic State fighters laying siege to Kobani. Turkey had taken in well over a million Syrian refugees from the three-and-a-half year-old conflict already before the latest wave, but this influx is the largest yet, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. Overcome: Life is hard for Syrian refugees, and questions have been raised about Turkey's ability to cope . Refugees: Young girls face an uncertain future as they reach the border.

In the last week alone, more than 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the Islamic State fighters laying siege to Kobani. Turkey is likely to gain parliamentary approval for cross-border military operations in Syria and Iraq this week as Islamic State insurgents threaten its territory, but will be hesitant to send in troops without an internationally-enforced no-fly zone. Turkish tanks and armoured vehicles took up positions on hills overlooking Kobani on Monday as shelling by the Sunni Muslim militants intensified and stray fire hit Turkish soil. The Islamic State advance to within clear sight of the Turkish army has piled pressure on Ankara to take a more robust stance against the militants as part of the U.S.-led coalition carrying out air strikes in Iraq and Syria. Air campaign: An  F-22A Raptor refuelling before strike operations on ISIS positions in Syria . Turkey, a NATO member with long borders with both countries, has so far declined to take a frontline role, fearful partly that the military action will strengthen Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and bolster Kurdish militants allied to Kurds in Turkey who have fought for three decades for greater autonomy. Meanwhile, Iraqi Kurdish forces captured a strategic border crossing and several villages from Islamic State fighters in northern Iraq on Tuesday, scoring gains as the militants were pounded by heavy U.S.-led air strikes and the Iraqi army advanced from the south. An Iraqi Kurdish political source said Kurdish peshmerga fighters took control of the Rabia border crossing with Syria in a battle that began before dawn.

Several hundred thousand refugees are reportedly still in Kobani and aid agencies are bracing for a massive exodus into Turkey . Twelve Islamic State fighters' bodies lay on the border at the crossing after the battle, said Hemin Hawrami head of the Kurdish Democratic Party's foreign relations department, on Twitter. The ability to cross the frontier freely has been a major tactical advantage for Islamic State fighters on both sides. Fighters swept from Syria into northern Iraq in June and returned with heavy weapons seized from fleeing Iraqi government troops, which they have used to expand their territory in Syria. U.S.-led forces have been bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq since August and expanded the campaign to Syria last week in an effort to defeat the fighters who have swept through Sunni areas of both countries, killing prisoners, chasing out Kurds and ordering Shi'ites and non-Muslims to convert or die.","Syrian Kurds continue to flee town close to border with Turkey .

"Mars is a weird and wonderful world of odd rocks that formed long ago in the planet’s history. And this latest image is no exception, as the Curiosity rover has spotted what looks like a bizarre set of ‘traffic lights’ on the surface. Of course, the discovery is nothing more than a chance alignment of rocks and shapes - but it highlights just how interesting the Martian surface is. Scroll down for video . The Curiosity rover has spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on Mars (shown in the red ring in this image). Washington-based Nasa is yet to comment on the latest discovery. The finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on Mars can be . In the image, a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are stacked on top of each other. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. They bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on Earth. But it’s highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation. The image was shot from the six-foot (1.8 metre) high, left-hand side mast cam on the Curiosity Rover. It was the 753rd day the rover has been exploring the red planet. The rock was spotted in the image by space video journalist Joe White from Bristol who runs a YouTube channel called ArtAlienTV. ‘I saw this one and I thought “hang on, that looks a bit strange”. I think it looks like a traffic light. ‘It is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference, but I would estimate it was about 12 inches [30.5cm]. ‘I posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole.’ The 'traffic lights' (left) were spotted by Curiosity (right) on its way to the base of Mount Sharp, a geologically fascinating region that could explain how Mars lost its wet and habitable environment. Other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole . The rock was spotted by space video journalist Joe White. Mr White said: 'I saw this one and I thought ""hang on, that looks a bit strange"". I think it looks like a traffic light' (stock image shown). The image from Curiosity is just one of many fascinating rocks on the red planet that resembles something we are familiar with on Earth . Just days earlier, Curiosity had spotted a ball-shaped rock on the surface of Mars. Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter, according to Discovery News. Curiosity is currently at the base of Mount Sharp, which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago. The area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of Mars. And, scientists hope the region might reveal how and why Mars lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment, with water flowing on its surface. This, in turn, may provide answers on the future of Earth. The discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the Martian surface (shown). Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter . Yesterday India's first mission to Mars, the ISRO's Mars Orbiter, arrived at Mars and released its first image (shown) of the red planet's surface. 'Howdy @MarsCuriosity? Keep in touch.

"The Euro dropped below 75p this morning as markets reacted to the election victory of an anti-austerity party in Greece. George Osborne warned Britain's economic stability depends on a strong eurozone as the future of the single currency was plunged into crisis. The Chancellor urged Greece's new leaders to act 'responsibly' after Syriza triumphed, warning that the institutions of the eurozone are 'not working well enough', which has an impact on the UK. The result puts Greece on a collision course with finance ministers across the EU, after Syriza vowed to reopen Greece's vast bailout deal. At 5pm, one euro was worth 74.82p, after falling to an 14-year low against the dollar overnight. The euro has been falling in value against the pound and the dollar for more than a year, and there are fears about the impact of Syriza's election victory in Greece on the stability of the eurozone . The euro, already hammered by the stimulus package, sunk to a 14-year low against the US dollar overnight before pulling back some of the losses. The pound rose to a new near-seven-year high of 1.35 against the single currency though, again, this was pared back later. But British and European stock markets appeared to shrug off the result, which many analysts had predicted. The FTSE 100 finished in positive territory - ending up 19.57 points. French and German markets also posted gains, suggesting the markets had already 'priced in' a Syriza victory. Alexis Tsipras's Syriza won the poll, but fell just short of an overall majority. He has pledged to renegotiate Greece's 240 billion euro (£179 billion) international bailout deal, and reverse many of the reforms that creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010. The result threatens the continued membership of Greece in the 19-bloc currency. The FTSE 100 Index opened down by just under 0.5 per cent lower. Mr Osborne, who is on a visit to Cornwall, said relying on spending more money to get out of difficulties was a 'panacea, false hope'. 'Ultimately, if you take at face value all the things that the new Greek government has promised, including new big increases in public expenditure, I think that is going to be very difficult to deliver and incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members,' he said. 'But I hope that both sides now act responsibly. 'Everyone has in the past looked over the precipice of Greek exit from the euro and pulled back. It is certainly in the UK's interest that we have stability, that we have proper dialogue here between members of the euro. 'But ultimately what the UK needs is a strong partner, and the institutions of the eurozone are not working well enough for the people of Europe, and that has an impact on us.' British Chancellor George Osborne, pictured today on a visit to Taunton in Somersert, urged all sides in Greece to 'now act responsibly' to prevent a new financial crisis . In a message on Twitter last night, David Cameron also cautioned over the effects of the crisis. 'The Greek election will increase economic uncertainty across Europe. That's why the UK must stick to our plan, delivering security at home,' he wrote. Yanis Varoufakis, a Syriza MP tipped to become Greece's next finance minister, told BBC Radio  that the country's austerity programme had been like 'waterboarding'. But he insisted that a Greek exit from the euro was not 'on the cards' and the party would not take a 'confrontational' approach. 'There has been a bit of posturing on our side. What really matters now is that we sit down and discuss a way that the haircut to our debt - the debt writedown - is minimised,' he said. 'Grexit is not on the cards, we are not going to Brussels or Frankfurt and Berlin in a confrontational style... 'To have this debt schedule, debt repayment schedule as we do at the moment, which is completely unrealistic and utterly disconnected from Greek growth, that is not good for them, it is not good for us. What we want to do is bind our repayments to our growth.' A triumphant Alexis Tsipras told Greeks that his radical left party's win meant an end to 'austerity and destruction' Supporters crowded the streets of Athens to hear Mr Tsipras speak outside the city's University Headquarters . The Green party has backed Syriza's anti-austerity victory and pinned its hopes on a left-wing uprising in the UK. Green MP Caroline Lucas said she had been 'inspired' by the 'huge vote' for Syriza. 'Now EU must listen to people & economists & respond with debt forgivenesss & support,' she wrote on Twitter. Green MEPs Scott Cato and Keith Taylor also called for an anti-austerity revolution in Britain. 'Greens share the view of the new government that austerity is a failed model which has piled misery on the poorest while making the wealthiest even richer,' they said in a statement. They added: 'This result shows that challenging business as usual politics can win the support of the people. 'In the UK we are witnessing a Green Surge, in no small part due to our anti-austerity agenda, and we hope the Greek election result marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model and failing Governments across Europe.' CMC Markets chief analyst Michael Hewson said: 'It's events in Europe that are at the epicentre of the markets focus once again, and the victory of the anti-austerity party Syriza in the latest Greek elections, and the ramifications of which could well ripple out across Europe through the rest of this year, as elections loom in Portugal, Spain as well as Italy.' The election result comes after the European Central Bank last week set out a 1.1 trillion euro (£820 million) asset purchase programme, an event which has already weakened the euro. Last month, inflation in the eurozone turned negative for the first time since 2009, partly due to the recent sharp fall in oil prices. IG chief market strategist Chris Weston added: 'If the trend through Europe is to reject austerity, reduce the shackles of debt and look for more pro-growth measures, then Greece has set a strong precedent and parties like the newly-formed Podemos in Spain will be keen to see if this trend can spill over as they approach national elections later in the year.' A triumphant Mr Tsipras told Greeks that his radical left party's win meant an end to 'austerity and destruction'. 'The Greek people have made history. Hope has made history,' Mr Tsipras said in his victory speech at a conference hall in central Athens. Mr Tsipras said his party's victory had made the 'troika a thing of the past', referring to the three international institutions - the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank - that have carried out inspections to monitor Greece's progress before approving each instalment of bailout funds. 'The verdict of the Greek people ends, beyond any doubt, the vicious circle of austerity in our country,' Mr Tsipras said. 'The verdict of the Greek people, your verdict, annuls today in an indisputable fashion the bailout agreements of austerity and disaster. 'The verdict of the Greek people renders the troika a thing of the past for our common European framework.' The result in Greece is being watched closely by financial markets around the world, including Tokyo (pictured) It is expected Mr Tsipras will meet the leader of the small Independent Greeks party later today 'to confirm the support and possible participation of the Independent Greeks in the new government,' according to a Syriza official. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'This is a desperate cry for help from the Greek people, millions of whom have been impoverished by the euro experiment. 'An extraordinary game of poker will now begin with Chancellor Merkel, with the European Central Bank powerless to do much than be an observer.' Labour's former Europe minister Peter Hain compared the measures imposed on the Greeks to the restrictions placed upon Germany after the First World War. On Twitter he said: 'Fantastic Syriza win: austerity does not work for Greece, for Tory/Lib Dem UK, nor for EU; we all need investment in growth not savage cuts.'","Radical Syriza triumphs in Greek elections on pledge to renegotiate bailout .

"The posters show apparently terrified people running down flights of stairs, cowering in a darkened corner and anxiously talking on their mobile phones . Alarmist posters on what commuters should do in the event of a terror outrage were issued by police yesterday. Instead of an appeal for calm, the advice is ‘run, hide and tell’ in a throwback to notices at the height of nuclear attack hysteria in the 1980s. The campaign urges commuters to ‘stay safe’ during a firearms or weapons attack. The posters show apparently terrified people running down flights of stairs, cowering in a darkened corner and anxiously talking on their mobile phones. The flyers tell passengers what to do in the event of a Mumbai-style gun attack or bombing at one of the UK’s busy terminals. They are being distributed by police after Home Secretary Theresa May warned this week that the threat to Britain from home-grown Muslim extremists or those returning from fighting with Islamic State in Syria or Iraq is ‘greater than ever’. The posters instruct: ‘If you hear gunfire or a weapons attack, leave the area safely if you can. If this puts you in greater danger, find a safe place to take cover.’ But critics have claimed the posters, handed out around the country as part of Counter Terrorism Awareness Week, are ‘scaremongering’ and have been compared the leaflets to the Cold War adverts telling people to ‘Duck and Cover’ if caught in a nuclear attack. Chief Constable Paul Crowther, of the British Transport Police (BTP) said: ‘For commuters, who make the same journey over and over again, it can be easy to become oblivious to their surroundings. ‘But I would urge them to remain alert, use their instinct and have the confidence to report anything that strikes them as out-of-place or suspicious. He added that earlier this month a man was sentenced for terrorism offences after being caught in possession of information about how to make bombs. University student Andreas Pierides, 22, narrowly avoided jail after he admitted taking nine distress flares on to a passenger jet at Stansted Airport and possessing a terrorist manual. Police arrested him as he was about to board a flight after a member of the public saw him reading an electronic publication on a train which appeared to include bomb-making instructions. The flyers tell passengers what to do in the event of a Mumbai-style gun attack or bombing at one of the UK’s busy terminals. Pictured, a gunman identified by police as Ajmal Kasab walks through the Chatrapathi Sivaji Terminal railway station in Mumbai, India . He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment suspended for two years after claiming he was going to set off the flares at a football match.‘This was as a direct result of a rail passenger reporting suspicions to train staff. We need others to follow suit and play their part in keeping the UK’s transport systems safe from terrorists,’ he said. But transport users took to Twitter to complain about the leaflets, which some said were stoking fear. Rob Thompson wrote: ‘These leaflets are more likely to cause panic than any apparent terrorism. Chris Irvine, from Rochester, Kent, said: ‘I cannot believe that the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Metropolitan Police are putting this out. ‘It’s totally alarmist. I grew up in Northern Ireland but I have never seen anything like it. Obviously we have to take the threat seriously, but I don’t see how striking the fear of God into people helps.’ And Michael Earl added: ‘Unbelievable! They might as well just say “Run like hell and start a panic”.’ The leaflets were handed out after Mrs May used a keynote speech to reveal that 40 terrorist attacks had been foiled since the July 7 bombings in London in 2005, which killed 52 commuters. Yesterday  the Home Office published a range of anti-terrorism measures aimed at tackling the threat, including stripping would-be jihadists of their passports and a legal requirement by schools, prisons and councils to put in place policies to stop would-be extremists being radicalised. In her speech on Monday, Mrs May said: ‘We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face. ‘In an open and free society, we can never entirely eliminate the threat from terrorism. But we must do everything possible in line with our shared values to reduce the risks posed by our enemies.’","Posters advise travellers what to do in case of gun or bomb attack .

"A doctor has recorded the moment he delivered a baby inside an intact amniotic sac. Obstetrician Dr Aris Tsigris published the photo of the newborn on his Facebook page after delivering the baby via caesarean section in Amarousion, north of Athens. Because the sac had not been punctured, Dr Tsigris said the baby did not even realise it had been born and behaved as if it was still inside the mother's womb. A glimpse into the womb: This astonishing photograph, taken by obstetrician Dr Aris Tsigris,  shows the baby who was delivered inside an intact amniotic sac. Until the sac is punctured the baby will behave as if it is still inside its mother . The amniotic sac is a bag of fluid inside the womb where the unborn baby develops and grows. It is also referred to as the ‘membranes’, because the sac is made of two membranes called the amnion and the chorion. The sac is filled with clear, pale fluid, in which the unborn baby floats and moves. The fluid helps to cushion the baby from bumps and injury, as well as providing them with fluids that they can breathe and swallow. The fluid also maintains a constant temperature for the baby. The amniotic sac starts to form and fill with fluid within days of a woman conceiving. Amniotic fluid is mainly water but from about week 10 onwards, the baby passes small amounts of urine into the fluid. An amniotic sac develops just days after a woman conceives (pictured 40 days into pregnancy). It is filled with fluid which cushions the baby from bumps and nourishes it . The amount of amniotic fluid increases gradually during pregnancy until about week 38, when it reduces slightly until the baby is born. Jessica Alba's daughter Haven was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011 . Typically the amniotic sac breaks on its own during birth, which is commonly referred to as a mother's ‘water breaking’. Dr Tsigris that the chance of the amniotic sac remaining completely intact after birth was ‘ultra rare’ and he was left ‘breathless’ by the sight of the newborn born on March 12, according to a report by Nine News. The doctor said there was no risk to the baby as it was still feeding off the placenta and would begin to breathe as soon as the sac was broken. The photo has since been shared more than 8000 times. Actress Jessica Alba has spoken out about her daughter Haven who was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011. She said at the time: ‘The doctor had never seen anything like it before. He grabbed the nurse and said: “Look at this!”. 'I was in the middle of pushing and he told me to hold on a minute and not to push. 'He was wearing basketball shorts and a T-shirt and said: ‘Oh I have to get my scrubs on for this!’ The sac burst on its own after she came out. It was a trip.' In fact Jessica’s experience inspired Haven’s name. She explained: ‘When I was in recovery we still hadn’t chosen her name. [Her father Cash Warren] picked her up and said she came into the world in her ‘safe haven’ and [her name] clicked right then for both of us.’ Being born 'with the caul' occurs when a child is delivered with a portion of amniotic membrane on their face. 'Caul' literally means 'helmeted head' or 'veil'. A baby with the caul is called the 'caulbearer'. Being born with the caul in medieval times was interpreted as a sign of good luck and that the child was destined for greatness. Saving the caul was considered an important tradition of childbirth. The midwife would rub a sheet of paper across the baby's head and face, pressing the material of the caul onto the paper. It would then be presented to the mother, to be kept as an heirloom. Other traditions have linked the caul to fertility and some say it protects a person from the forces of evil, such as witches and sorcerers. Being born 'en caul' is the term used when the child is born within an intact amniotic sac, which occurred in the story above. It is also known as a 'veiled birth'. Most en caul births occur in premature babies. Some legends suggest that being born en caul means you will never drown. Statistics relating to such births are sparse, but deliveries involving any form of caul are thought to occur in roughly one in 80,000 births.","Greek obstetrician Dr Aris Tsigris posted the image on Facebook .

"When seven people got free meals at a Cardiff diner by completing its challenge of eating a 69oz mixed grill in only one hour - the owner decided to beef up his menu to defeat his customers. Restaurant boss Paul Stevens has created an entire menu of 40 different Man Vs Food mega-meals. Father of one Mr Stevens, 53, beefed up his Desperate Dan-style cuisine to include a giant 96oz rump steak, a 6 ½ pound ‘baby’ burger weighing more than a sack of potatos, ‘suicide’ chicken wings covered in hot chilli sauce and a selection of giant desserts. Scroll down for video . Tucking in: Diners at Sizzle and Grill in Cardiff tackle a 'baby Burger' Filling: The diner's pancake stack wouldn't leave you much room for seconds . Hunger game: The two-foot-long Po Boy, which comes with a meat or fish option . He even serves up scorpion, ants, meal worms and Kangaroo testicles. Inspired by the U.S television programme Man vs Food, Paul, he claims to have the only restaurants in Britain providing an entire menu catering for food challenges. He has even bought the brand name Man vs Food Limited. Twenty stone Mr Stevens, who runs Sizzle And Grill in Cardiff, South Wales, said: ‘We don’t think anything on our menu is weird - we just started to introduce a cow pie that the Dandy character Desperate Dan eats and we have a proper bowl which is two-foot in diameter. Meaty: The baby burger comes with cheese, bacon, onion rings, chips and a little salad . Wed alert: The Sizzle & Grill Steak House is popular with stag parties . ‘What we do know that it is very rare to have a whole menu dedicated to Man vs Food challenges. The only thing we do not do is starters because that would be too much. ‘We even cater to vegetarians and have a Kids vs Food challenge. There is an even sign outside that says our place is ‘the home of Man vs Food'. ‘One party pre-ordered our suicide wings and I made them aware of how hot they were - but they added another ten portions. The more you tell them not to do it, the more they want to. ‘I am not sure why I do it. It is certainly fun watching people do them but it is also heart breaking as well. Sometimes people get 45 minutes into a challenge and it looks like they are going to do it but then they hit the wall. ‘One guy had 15 minutes left and about 2 bites left. He just could not do it and it would have saved him £60.’ Mr Steven's 69oz mixed grill challenge consists of a steak, two pieces of gammon, five pork chops, half a chicken, four sausages, two eggs, mushrooms, peas, a side salad and a bowl of chips. But amazingly one diner managed to complete the meal in 22 minutes. Speedy: One customer managed to eat the Mixed Grill in just 22 minutes . The menu has since progressed to include dishes such as a £29.99 Orgasma Burger; a tower of five steak burgers, five chicken burgers, with 15 other layers of salad, onion rings, chillies, mushrooms and ham. All the burgers, bought from the butchers next door to the restaurant are freshly made daily with a mixture of minced steak, cracked black pepper, caramelised onion and no other additives. The Po boy - a two-feet long sandwich - comes in meat or fish whilst diners have the chance to down 75 chicken wings in 30 minutes or a giant sausage sandwich called The Widowmaker. Desserts include a six litre bucket of ice cream and a giant banana split featuring six bananas. So far the cooked-to-order 96oz steak at £69.00 and the £34.99 6 ½ pound double cheese Baby Burger are to yet be eaten within an hour. The full spread: The biggest dishes that Sizzle & Grill serve up . It's safe to say that your hunger will dessert you if you manage to finish Sizzle & Grill's serving of ice cream . Food for thought: Mr Steven's menu was inspired by the U.S television programme Man vs Food, with the show's former presenter Adam Richman pictured . Tall order: The restaurant's Burger Tower (left) and kangaroo testicles (right), which may be a little bit hard to stomach for some . Orgasma Calories: 12,000Ingredients: A tower of five Steak Burgers, five chicken burgers, cheese slices,  lettuce, tomatoes, onion rings, bacon, thinly sliced ham, a few chillies, mushrooms, side salad all in a warm ciabatta bun and chips. Mixed grill Calories: 4,000Ingredients: A steak, two pieces of gammon, five pork . chops, half a chicken, four sausages, two eggs, mushrooms, peas, a side . salad and a bowl of chips . Po Boy Calories: 3,700 Ingredients for meat option: A two-foot sandwich with melted cheese top and bottom filled with lettuce leaves, spicy slaw, layer of ham, mixed peppers, grated cheese, sliced steak, and mushrooms and topped with a sticky barbeque sauce, served on large plank with a bowl of chips. Fish option: A two-foot sandwich with melted cheese top and bottom filled with lettuce leaves, spicy slaw, battered calamari rings, wait bait, crayfish and prawns, and topped with a seafood sauce, served on a plank with a bowl of chips. The King Wing Challenge is another that has defeated customers. Mr Stevens added: ‘The 69oz mixed grill was probably one of the hardest challenges but although I sold nearly 3000, seven people completed it in the hour set - the quickest in 22 minutes.’ ‘I myself cannot get near those meals. I am quite a large person myself and we have found that it’s the slight people who can complete the challenges. The large people just can’t do it. ‘Apparently there is scientific reason for that. Fat people have more fat so their stomach cannot grow and expand more. I don’t know if that is true. ‘We do a lot of stag parties and team bonding exercises coming from all over the place. More and more parties are coming in to attempt the challenges together. A dozen will try the challenge and of course the rest of the party are egging them on. ‘Obviously it is very noisy. We are now doing less regular steak meals because if you have a group in attempting a challenge, screaming and shouting at one end and you have a table of two next to them making eyes at each other. It doesn’t work and so we have had to change our menu because of it.’ Along with giant portions, the 54 -over restaurant also offers a selection of creepy crawly delights and exotic food challenges. Mr Stevens said: ‘We found that exotic meats are getting very popular with crocodile, kangaroo, ostrich, zebra and python often chosen. We also serve ants. We are getting really busy with the ants. 'Stags really like them. Scorpions, ants, and meal worm, all are kept in the fridge at the back so as not to scare the children. ‘Last week a customer asked for Gerbil as apparently it is a delicacy in Peru. We didn’t do it however because it would be too hard to come by and I think quite a lot of people might be disgusted by it. ‘People often question me about it not being healthy. It probably doesn’t help that we do a Kids vs Food Challenge too as we do a lot of children’s parties. We do get a lot of abuse for it but we just want to cater for everyone. HeftyL Mr Stevens' 96oz steak, which takes up an entire plate . ‘Our Po Boy can be done with quorn so it will cater for vegetarians. We wouldn’t turn anyone away. Now and then someone will come in and they will say ""you should not be doing that"". We just say ""it’s the customer’s decision and we don’t force anyone to eat anything"". ‘We are a little bit different from other places that do these challenges as we use quality food. What we have found is that if customers do not eat it all we are asked to put it in a doggy bag. If it wasn’t of good quality why would they take it home?' The Kids vs Food challenge consists of a milder version of the adult ghost chilli Suicide Wing Challenge, a small hot dog and four two oz burgers, which they call a Quadruple Bypass. Seven Suicide wings are laced with Naga Bhut Jolokia in a smokey paprika and honey sauce measuring a stagger 1,578,548 in Scoville heat units. Tabasco Red Pepper sauce registers at 2,500 Scoville units on the scale invented by American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912.","Sizzle And Grill in Cardiff, South Wales, serves up 40 different mega-meals .

"Having finished his nightmare at Manchester United, Brazilian midfielder Anderson’s return home to play for Internacional has certainly not started smoothly. Manchester United fans might not be surprised but Anderson lasted just 36 minutes of a Copa Libertadores contest against Bolivian side The Strongest on Tuesday evening, huffing and puffing his way to the touchline. Having been substituted, the exhausted 26-year-old sat on the bench in some distress before requesting an oxygen mask from Internacional staff, although the match in La Paz was played at extremely high altitude. Internacional midfielder Anderson clasps onto an oxygen mask during the Copa Libertadores clash . The 26-year-old leaves the pitch after only 36 minutes during the 3-1 loss to Bolivian side The Strongest . The former Manchester United midfielder was clearly struggling at the high altitude . Despite being Brazilian, Anderson has maybe become too accustomed to the climate in Manchester as he struggled to cope in La Paz - a place well known for causing altitude sickness as the city stands at 3,500m above sea level. Anderson left Old Trafford earlier this month and so far the midfielder has failed to make an impact for his new employers, with Internacional eventually losing 3-1 against The Strongest on Tuesday evening. He made his debut against Cruzeiro last week, only to miss a crucial penalty after coming on as a second-half substitute.

Anderson only featured twice for United under Louis van Gaal this season, last playing at the end of August . Anderson was seen as surplus to requirements under Louis van Gaal, making just two appearances for United this season and was a peripheral figure the season before under David Moyes, who loaned him out to Fiorentina. He rarely lived up to his potential since moving from Porto in a deal worth £27million in 2007. Anderson suffered a cruciate injury in 2010 and badly damaged his knee the following year. As a result he struggled for full match fitness and remained a squad player for United. When the second injury struck he was still only 22 but he had already achieved so much. Sir Alex Ferguson and his predecessors became frustrated with the Brazilian’s motivation and his apparent taste for fast food, which led to much ridicule from fans until he departed.

"A couple whose dying daughter 'lost hope' after being told she was terminally ill say patients have the right not to know their fate. Vickie Harvey, 24, had fought leukaemia twice - but went rapidly downhill after being told 'in graphic detail' how she was going to die, her parents say. Eric and Lyn Harvey, from Kidderminster, say they felt powerless and all they could do was comfort their daughter and wait for the inevitable. Tragic: Vickie Harvey, 24, had fought leukaemia twice - but went rapidly downhill after being told 'in graphic detail' how she was going to die, her parents Lyn and Eric say . They have now launched a campaign to give the dying the right not to know they are terminally ill. The couple claim their daughter could have lived to see another Christmas had she not been given the prognosis and 'lost all hope'. 'She just gave up on life after that,' said Mr Harvey. 'Vickie came home from hospital and barely got out of bed. 'Me and her mum held her hand and she died barely two weeks later.' Mr and Mrs Harvey are fighting for the introduction of ‘Vickie’s Wish’, which would allow patients to choose not to be told of a terminal prognosis. Pledge: 'Vickie's Wish' would allow patients to choose not to be told of a terminal prognosis . Miss Harvey, a self-employed beautician, was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in September 2012. She underwent a stem cell transplant on Christmas Day at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The youngest of four children, she was told she was in remission last April. She celebrated by helping her father organise a surprise 40th wedding anniversary party for her mother. 'She was back to her old self - bubbly and happy,' recalls Mr Harvey. 'We all had a fantastic day and thought life was great.' But in September, almost a year after she was first diagnosed, the family was given the devastating news that the disease had returned. 'Vickie broke down and sobbed her heart out. But she picked herself up again,' says Mr Harvey, 61. After weeks of treatment at the Queen Elizabeth, Miss Harvey wanted to be closer to home and was transferred to the Worcester Royal Hospital. But her father says he lived in fear that doctors there would tell his daughter the truth about her condition. 'The doctors at the QE told us there wasn’t much hope for Vickie’s survival,' he said. 'But Vickie didn’t know that. 'She told us she didn’t want to hear anything negative. She didn’t want to lose hope and that was her wish.' He added that he and his wife had clashed with one doctor who said she did not agree with keeping information from patients. 'She was of the opinion that Vickie should be told everything so she could prepare herself. But I knew it would devastate her.' He claimed that Vickie was told of her prognosis in a private examination last November. Mr Harvey said: 'After [her prognosis] she changed - and never really got out of bed again. We knew she was dying, but we feel that, if she hadn't been told that day, she would have lasted longer' 'It should have only taken a few minutes but she was in there for half an hour,' he said. 'When we eventually went in, Vickie was crying her eyes out. 'She told us the doctor had told her in graphic detail what was going to happen to her.  She was frightened to death. 'After that she changed - and never really got out of bed again. We knew she was dying, but we feel that, if she hadn’t been told that day, she would have lasted longer. 'We would have had one last family Christmas together. That’s what hurts the most.' Miss Harvey died on December 10. Her parents have since written to Worcester Royal Hospital to complain and they met hospital bosses in February. Unhappy: Vickie's parents have complained about her care at Worcester Royal Hospital . They used the meeting to suggest the possibility of introducing a waiver that would allow patients to opt out of being given bad news. 'Such a waiver would have taken the pressure off the medical staff in Vickie’s case,' explained her father. The couple set up an online petition in support of their waiver idea and it has so far received more than 5,000 signatures. Mr Harvey said: 'We want to stop other families going through what we did. Someone should have an equal right not to know, as they do to know about their future. That was Vickie’s wish.' A Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust spokeswoman said: 'We met with Mr and Mrs Harvey to discuss their concerns and are pleased the meeting had a positive outcome. 'We have spoken to the family since and we and they are satisfied the matter has been dealt with appropriately.' To support the petition, visit you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/vickies-wish . 'We want to stop other families going . through what we did. Someone should have an equal right not to know, as . they do to know about their future. That was Vickie’s wish,' said parents Eric and Lyn Harvey. Couple lobbying for 'Vickie's Wish' to be passed. The waiver would mean that terminally ill patients could request not be told about how long they have to live and way in which they die. Mr and Mrs Harvey say they believe Vickie would have lived longer had she not been told about her death in detail. Couple say that the doctor went against Vickie's request by telling her how long she had to live because the doctor believed Vickie needed to prepare herself. British Medical Journal Debate between two palliative care experts asks whether patients should be told about their impending death. Experts Emily Collis and Katherine Sleeman say YES . Collis and Sleeman say that not communicating the news can affect the trust a patient has in their doctor. 'Patients have the right to make informed decisions about their healthcare,' they write. They say that information is empowering and allows the patient to put their affairs in order and for relatives to be informed about how they should carry out the deceased's wishes. A patient aware of their situation is more likely to die at home, they say. Open discussion helps relieve fears, they argue. Expert Leslie Blackhall says NO . Prognosis can never be certain, she says. Telling patients they are terminally ill 'creates more suffering than it relieves'. 'The real thing we need to focus on, if we are going to be truthful with patients, is helping them make decisions. We need to explain what we can do for them,' she said. Argues that patient should be told trajectory that their treatment will take, what medication will be next, but not how long a person has to live.","Beautician Vickie Harvey, 24, died from leukaemia last December .

"A former policeman insists selling Islamic state flags from his front yard was simply a shrewd business decision with the help from publicity that money can’t buy. Melbourne resident Rob Boot claims within minutes of hanging the first ISIS flag from his front yard two weeks ago, a taxi driver, that he described as of Middle Eastern appearance, knocked on his door in Carrum, in the city’s southeast, and bought it for $40. Ironically, when Mr Boot put the second flag out on display at 7am on Wednesday, he claims another taxi driver, who he also describes as being of Middle Eastern appearance, purchased it just five minutes later. Scroll down for video . Melbourne resident Rob Boot plans to sell more ISIS flags as the only two he imported from the U.S. were snapped up within minutes of hanging them in his front yard in Carrum in the city's southeast . Mr Boot denies that by selling the extreme terrorist regime’s flags, which he purchased from a U.S. supplier, he is encouraging terrorism. ‘People who are inclined to do what I would call – wicked things - or have a wicked frame of mind – are already that way,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘They are made that way through their acquaintances, or in their mosque they listen to Imams geeing them up, or they see poison on the internet and that gets them going.’ ‘You may get the odd nut ball who wants to undertake something but I don’t think my flag is going to set him off.’ However, the shrewd businessman admits the timing of deciding to start selling the ISIS flags was far from a coincidence. ‘I know jolly-well what I’m doing when I hang up these contentious flags - it’s not happenstance - I do it simply to get the publicity,' he said. 'The immediate aftermath is I get a huge amount of sales that lasts for several weeks afterwards which is publicity I couldn't afford to pay for.' 'I know what I'm hanging up in the morning and why and it brings people.' Not a stranger to controversy, Mr Boot experienced a boost to his sales in 2012 after receiving publicity for selling Nazi flags. Mr Boot denies that by selling the extreme terrorist regime’s flags, which he purchased from a US supplier, he is encouraging terrorism . This time around, he has received visits from the local police following complaints and even an ASIO agent asking him to assume the role of a ‘community leader’ by providing authorities with car registration details of customers who buy contentious items. ‘When people come onto my premises they come in good faith and  I enter into a contract with those people by selling them a flag,' he said. 'They trust me not to pass on their details and I don’t think it’s my job to do that.' Mr Boot, who is not breaking any law,  will continue to sell ISIS flags if he can continue to buy them from suppliers. The 62-year-old, who has been selling flags for five years, said he never asked customers why they chose particular designs. ‘I’m not interested in why they want it I don’t care if they want to hang it up as a curtain or outside their house or put it on their bed and have sex on it – I really don’t care,’ he said.

"Bentley may build its new luxury off-roader in Bratislava rather than Britain, the firm's bosses have revealed. In a dramatic blow to its 4,000-strong British work-force - and to Chancellor George Osborne ahead of today’s Budget - the firm's German chiefs announced at their annual results conference in London that they were considering manufacturing the £150,000 4X4 in the  Slovakian capital in Eastern Europe. Bratislava and Crewe are now  ‘in competition’ to build up to 4,000 of Bentley’s first sports utility vehicle (SUV)  a year, with the final decision to be made within weeks, they said. Hundreds of new jobs are riding on the outcome. Scroll down for video . Competition: Bentley's new SUV could be manufactured in Bratislava rather than Britain, the firm's bosses have revealed . Should Bratislava be chosen, the vehicle would become the first volume-produced Bentley to be built outside of the UK in the company's near 100 year history.It could not carry the plate that has adorned Bentleys for generations: ‘Made in Crewe, England’. Bosses insisted it would still have ‘Bentley DNA’,  but admitted it the plaque would like be altered to read: 'Designed in Crewe, England'. Critics say engineering genius and Bentley founder Walter Owen ‘W.O’ Bentley,  who founded the firm 94 years ago, would be turning in his grave along with generations of ‘Bentley Boys’ who treasure the car-maker. Its luxury vehicles are also famously a favourite of James Bond. The new Bentley SUV is set to go on sale from 2015-16 and will be a central plank in plans to double the luxury car-maker sales to 15,000  by 2018 accounting for between a quarter and a third of all global sales. Sales were already up 22 per cent last year to 8,510.The final ‘green light ‘decision will be made within weeks by Bentley’s German parent Volkswagen Group, based at Wolfsburg in Northern Germany.Cheaper labour rates in Slovakia and ‘uncertainty’ over whether Britain will remain in the European Union if there is a referendum were counting against the British case, bosses said. Craftsmanship, a ‘motivated’ British workforce, and the logical cost of transporting parts between Britain and Slovakia were in its favour, they added. Directors denied playing off governments in a bid to boost  grants, noting that Crewe was in line for £7million in subsidies tied to more jobs being created. Bentley’s chairman and chief executive Dr Wolfgang Schreiber said the decision on where to build up to 4,000 of the cars was one of the ‘last hurdles’ to be cleared as executives finalise the business case. He said there was plenty of room to build the new Bentley at Crewe and that capacity ‘is not the issue.’ Key deciding factors will be labour rates, logistical costs, finance and craftsmanship. Made in Crewe? The SUV could become the first volume-produced Bentley to be produced outside of the UK should Crewe lose out to Bratislava . If production is moved to Bratislava, the new Bentley 4X4 will  be built alongside other cars belonging to the Volkswagen Group such as the Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Touareg. Speaking at the top of the Gherkin skyscraper in the City of London Dr Schreiber said: ‘There is a chance that the whole car will be built in Bratislava. There is competition between the factories.’ ’We want to build sustainable cars that make money,' he said. ‘We have the components and the craftsmanship skills in Crewe.' Dr Schreiber and his two most senior Bentley board members  - including  sales and marketing director Kevin Rose, a Briton -  said they would prefer the model to be built in Crewe. They denied they were facing opposition from the main German-based Volkswagen Group board pushing for the model to be built in Bratislava. Dr Schreiber said: ’We are all fighting for the best decision for Bentley. ‘Everyone in Volkswagen knows how motivated and skilled the workers in Crewe are. Their interior craftsmanship is a true asset.’ 'Best decision for Bentley': Bosses said the craftsmanship and skill of Bentley's Crewe-based workforce was a 'true asset' Bentley did build some Flying Spur models in the Eastern German city of Dresden  during 2005 and 2006 because of a shortage of capacity at Crewe. But building the off-roader in Bratislava would be the first time a complete new model would have been built abroad. However, interior components would have to be shipped from Crewe to ensure a luxury feel. Potential buyers have already placed more than 2,000 pre-orders  even before the final showroom styling of the car has been revealed. Bentley’s chief finance officer Jan-Henrik Lafrentz said ‘stability’ was a key issue in the decision. The possibility of Britain leaving the EU - added to currency fluctuations between the Eurozone and the pound - were among issues being considered. Final styling of the new car has already been signed off and will be very different from that shown on a much criticised ‘concept’ version which appeared at last year’s Geneva Motor Show. Bentley boss Dr Schreiber admitted there  had been ‘room for improvement’ The new model is expected to share the ‘face’ of the more familiar Bentley Continental. He said: ’It's completely different now. It has the DNA of the current cars but looks even more special.’ Global sales director Kevin Rose said the new Bentley 4X4 would begin in price and prestige where the new rival Range Rover leaves off. About  half of all sales will come from the United States and China followed by the Middle East, Russia and Europe. Some 87.3 per cent of Bentley’s cars are already  exported. Bentley had considered calling the new 4X4 ‘Falcon’ but Mr Rose said he did not like it and that the company was looking at a name that would be more fitting across all its worldwide markets. But Mr Rose insisted: 'If there is assembly  somewhere else, we’d still very much claim it as a Bentley. It has Bentley DNA.'Booming Bentley has been a huge success story for Volkswagen. Operating profit is up from £6.85million to £86million, with turnover up 29.9 per cent to £1.2billion. It expects ‘double digit’ growth in 2013. Germany’s  Volkswagen Group bought  Bentley in 1998 from Vickers PLC as part of a complicated three-way £430million deal in which their German rivals BMW took control of Rolls-Royce.","Production of new SUV could be moved to Slovakia, bosses have revealed .

"Legendary musician Jimi Hendrix has been named the greatest guitar player of all time, according to industry experts and leading exponents of the art. He topped a poll for Rolling Stone magazine which said he had ‘exploded our idea of what rock music could be’. British guitarists took the next four places, with 'Slowhand' Eric Clapton the runner-up. The greatest: Jimi Hendrix performing live on stage during his heyday . Grammy-winning Tom Morello was among those who voted, nominating key Hendrix tracks Purple Haze and The Star-Spangled Banner. He said: 'Jimi Hendrix exploded our idea of what rock music could be: He manipulated the guitar, the whammy bar, the studio and the stage.' Hendrix was able to manipulate his instrument like nobody before or since, but it  was only after winning the admiration of Clapton, Jeff Beck and others while he was in  London in 1966 that the American really became a star. He famously bought his first guitar at the age of 15 in 1957 for £5, astonished fans by playing with his teeth while out of his mind on hallucinogenic drugs and headlined Woodstock at the peak of his powers in 1969. Like Eric Clapton, he popularised use of . the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock,which he often used to deliver an . exaggerated sense of pitch in his solos. He was influenced by blues artists . such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King and Elmore . James, and later began wearing a moustache like singer Little Richard, saying 'I want to do with my guitar what Little Richard does . with his voice'. 1. Jimi Hendrix . 2. Eric Clapton . 3.

He died aged 27 at his girlfriend's house in Notting Hill, west London in 1970 following a party. Like Hendrix, Amy Winehouse was the latest in a long list of musicians including Brian Jones, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain in the so-called 27 Club who died at the age 27. Among the legends on the list spanning the ages are B.B. King, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page and Pete Townshend. The panel of experts recruited to vote for their favourite guitar players included musicians such as Lenny Kravitz, Eddie Van Halen (who himself appears in the chart at No.8), Brian May and Dan Auerbach from The Black Keys. A selection of Rolling Stone's senior writers and editors also contributed. The experts also weighed in on their favourites, with Pearl Jam's Mike McCready calling Eddie Van Halen 'a master of riffs' and Joe Perry praising Jimmy Page's 'vision of how to transcend the stereotypes of what the guitar can do.' The full list will be featured in a special issue with four special covers of Van Halen, Clapton, Hendrix and Page, and will be on newsstands.

"Tesla has updated its electric sports car with a huge boost to its battery, enabling it to drive 400 miles on a single charge. The upgraded battery pack  along with tweaks to its aerodynamics means it will effectively double its range. To prove the capabilities, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed the firm plans to drive the car from San Francisco to LA in a single trip. Scroll down for video . The firm also revealed a major update for its car software, allowing it to be turned on remotely via an app . The Roadster was the brainchild of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has since gone on to revolutionise space travel with his SpaceX Firm. A co-founder of PayPal, he is also developing a hi-tech travel system called hyperloop, . The firm first released the roadster in 2008. It will out-drag a Ferrari, hitting 60mph in just 3.7 seconds, and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were among the first customers to get their $109,000 Roadsters. However, in terms of popularity, is has been superseded by the Model S, a more 'grown up' sedan - and second hand model now sell four around $22,000, more than its original list price, since production stopped in 2012. However, the original car was a historic breakthrough for the electric car industry. The original Roadster battery was the very first lithium ion battery put into production in any vehicle. 'It was state of the art in 2008, but cell technology has improved substantially since then,' Tesla said. 'We have identified a new cell that has 31% more energy than the original Roadster cell. 'Using this new cell we have created a battery pack that delivers roughly 70kWh in the same package as the original battery.' The firm has also made a new aero kit for the car to reduce drag by 15%, amd revealed tyres with 20% less drag. 'Combining all of these improvements we can achieve a predicted 40-50% improvement on range between the original Roadster and Roadster 3.0,' it said. The firm has also made a new aero kit for the car to reduce drag by 15%, amd revealed tyres with 20% less drag. 'There is a set of speeds and driving conditions where we can confidently drive the Roadster 3.0 over 400 miles. 'We will be demonstrating this in the real world during a non-stop drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles in the early weeks of 2015.' Appointments for upgrading Roadsters will be taken this spring once the new battery pack finishes safety validation. 'We are confident that this will not be the last update the Roadster will receive in the many years to come,' it said. The firm also revealed a major update for its car software. 'Software v6.0 update introduces traffic-based navigation and commute advice, provides an in-car view of daily schedules, enables location-based air suspension settings, and allows owners to name their Model S and start it remotely using their mobile phone,' it said. However the firm has been hit by falling gas prices. The $109,000 Roadster, launched in 2011, . A top analyst slashed his earnings projections for the California-based auto company earlier this month, estimating that Tesla will sell 40percent fewer cars in the next five years than he had previously forecast. Tesla's stock has fallen 31percent since hitting a high in September. On Monday is closed below $200 a share fro the first time since May - hitting a seven-month low. Oil prices have plunged more than 40 percent during that time period and gas is down to $2 a gallon in many states.","$109,000 Roadster was firm's first car, released in 2008 .

"No tax cut: Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail that the top rate of tax will stay at 45p until at least 2015 . The top rate of income tax will not be cut, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has warned Tory MPs. Danny Alexander, the most senior Liberal Democrat in the government after Nick Clegg, said there was ‘no prospect’ of the 45p rate being cut in this Parliament. He gave a strong indication that the Lib Dems would never agree to reduce the rate, even in the event of another coalition government with the Conservatives. ‘45p is a good place to be - it is mid-range on international league tables,’ Mr Alexander told the Daily Mail. ‘My priority is to cut taxes for working people in this country. The best way of doing that is to increase the basic threshold.’ Boris Johnson recently said there was ‘no doubt’ that Chancellor George Osborne would cut the top rate of tax ‘in this parliament’. David Cameron also suggested he would consider slashing the rate down to 40p if it meant rich people ended up paying more tax. The Prime Minister pointed out that reducing the rate from 50p had actually raised more revenue, as fewer people were trying to dodge tax. The coalition reduced the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p in 2012. Mr Cameron said: ‘It just seemed to me that if your top rate of tax is not raising the money that it should, and it’s holding back the competitiveness of the economy, then even if it’s politically unpopular to change it, you must do it. 'I’m trying to sweep away all the things that hold back the chance of Britain being a real success story in the 21st century. ‘What we’ve seen since the change is actually the growth of tax revenues. Tax rates should be set to raise money, not to send messages. I’m interested in making sure that the rich in this country pay a lot of tax, which they do. 'They’re paying a bigger share ... than they were. If people can bring forward arguments about how to maximise the revenue from the top rate of tax, I’m always interested to read them.’ But Mr Alexander made clear the Lib Dems would block any further cut in the 45p rate, which applies to income of £150,000 or over. Asked if it would go back to 40p, the rate for almost all of Labour’s years in power, he replied: ‘There is no prospect of that. I tell you from me, I am a tax cutter by instinct but I want to cut taxes for ordinary people in this country. I am quite willing to ask the wealthiest for a bit more.’ Tory consensus: David Cameron, left, and George Osborne, right, are both thought to be in favour of a rate cut . Mr Alexander suggested he favoured wealth taxes on the richest, but targeted at assets rather than earnings. In a wide-ranging interview, he also said that Lib Dems who talked of walking away from the coalition before the general election ‘need their heads examined’. Lib Dem grandee Sir Menzies Campbell and Business Secretary Vince Cable have both publicly touted a disengagement strategy ahead of polling day in May 2015. But Mr Alexander called that strategy ‘mad’: ‘Anyone who thinks that we are going to disengage from the Coalition before the election needs their head examined. ‘Every day that the coalition stays strong is a day that the economy gets stronger and we absolutely see that right the way through to polling day.’ Mr Alexander’s insistence that the coalition should stay together is in contrast to Mr Cable, who at the Lib Dem conference said it ‘was certainly possible’ that the parties would split before May 2015. ‘The idea that somehow it would be to our advantage to walk away from that a few months before the election is just mad,’ he said. ‘We hadn’t been in government for 70 years. Now we are a party of government. And as a party of government you don’t walk away from government,’ the Inverness MP said. He urged activists to ‘shout from the rooftops’ about the role the Lib Dems played as part of the government. ‘We are an independent party, we have got lots of ideas of our own. But we have delivered a lot, we have a record to be proud of. People should shout that from the rooftops.’ The ambitious father of two - who was also the trusted confidante of former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy - declined to rule out standing as party leader in future. ‘I suppose I am hugely privileged to have the chance to do the job I am doing now and hopefully to make a good contribution to the country. Who knows what comes after that.' ‘It’s not something I am spending a lot of time thinking about.'","Chief Secretary to the Treasury told the Mail 45p rate is 'a good place to be'

"Bill Clinton has told Scots to reassure 'a world torn by identity conflicts' by voting No in an 11th-hour intervention in the independence debate. The former U.S. president said he was reluctant to express his view before now because he appreciated the decision was 'Scots alone to make'. But he said uncertainty over currency and the impact of 'long, complex' negotiations had convinced him to urge the people of Scotland to keep the Union. Scroll down for video . Mr Clinton said: 'With so much turmoil and division across the globe, I hope the Scots will inspire the world' In a statement released through the Better Together campaign: 'Because the independence vote is a decision for the Scots alone to make, and because Scots are already legendary for their independence of mind, I have been reluctant to express my views on the matter. 'I hope my decision to do so will be received in the spirit of friendship with which it is offered. 'I have watched the debate on the future of Scotland with great interest and admiration. 'With so much turmoil and division across the globe, I hope the Scots will inspire the world with a high turnout and a powerful message of both identity and inclusion. 'I understand and sympathise with those who want independence. Scotland is blessed with impressive human and natural resources and a strong desire for more widely shared prosperity and social solidarity. A spot of sightseeing: Mr Clinton playing golf on the famous course at St Andrews in 2001 . 'However, I hope the Scots people will vote to remain in the UK for several reasons: The proposal to keep the pound as its currency without the support that UK membership provides carries substantial risks, as we saw in the EU after the financial crisis. 'Separation will require a long complex negotiating process with considerable uncertainty and potential to weaken the Scottish economy. 'The increased autonomy promised Scotland by the UK provides most of the benefits of independence and avoids the downside risks. 'Unity with maximum self-determination sends a powerful message to a world torn by identity conflicts that it is possible to respect our differences while living and working together. 'This is the great challenge of our time. The Scots can show us how to meet it.'

"European regulators have ordered Google to clarify its new privacy policy and make it easier for users to opt out of it. France’s National Commission on . Computing and Freedom led a European investigation into Google’s new . unified policy, which replaced 60 individual policies for its search, email . and other services and regulates how it uses the personal data it . collects. Today it said the US company had 'months' to make changes. Scroll down for video . A double pronged attack: Google is expected to be told to 'unravel' the information pools on its users - as the US Federal Trade Commission is believed to be considering launching a massive antitrust suit . CNIL's president Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin said the company had 'three or four months' to make the revisions, otherwise 'authorities in several countries can take action against Google'. Google responded that it is reviewing the commission’s report but that it believes its policy respects European law. 'We have received the report and are reviewing it now,' said Peter Fleischer, its global privacy counsel. 'Our new privacy policy demonstrates our long-standing commitment to protecting our users' information and creating great products. 'We are confident that our privacy notices respect European law.' The commission said today that it has . three main concerns about the policy: it’s not clear enough in . explaining to users what data is collected and how it will be used; it’s . too difficult for users to opt out of data collection; and Google . doesn’t say how long it will hold onto data. The concerns were made in a letter . to the U.S. internet company, which was seen by Reuters. The letter, which stopped short of . declaring Google's approach to collecting user data illegal, follows an . investigation led by France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique . (CNIL) that began in February. Leading the inquiry on behalf of . Europe, France's data protection watchdog had already questioned the . legality and fairness of Google's new privacy policy, introduced in . March. The current row revolves around Google's decision to pool of anonymous user data across Google services. For Google, this is a big advantage when selling online ads. Google and other large internet . groups like Facebook provide free services to consumers and earn money . from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than . traditional TV or radio campaigns. This consolidated 60 privacy policies into one and pooled data . collected on individual users across its services, including YouTube, . Gmail and its social network Google+. Users cannot opt out. The regulators' letter said: 'Combining personal data on such a large scale creates high risks to the privacy of users.' 'Therefore, Google should modify its . practices when combining data across services for these purposes,' the . letter said. It was signed by 24 of EU's 27 data regulators plus those . of Croatia and Liechtenstein. In the past, the company has said the . changes would allow it to tailor search results more accurately and . improve services for consumers. Google has also said previously it is . confident that its privacy policy does not run foul of European law. In the letter, the regulators listed . 12 'practical recommendations' for Google to bring its privacy policy . into line. The first five cover how Google tells people about how their . personal information and browsing records will be used, highlighting . location data and credit card data in particular. The regulators also want Google to . spell out its intentions and methods for combining data collected from . its various services. They want the web search giant to ask users for . explicit consent when bundling data together, the letter said. The pooling of anonymous user data across Google services, is a big advantage when selling online ads. The news comes as Federal regulators . in the US are believed to be moving closer to suing Google over . allegations that the company has abused its dominance of Internet search . to stifle competition and drive up online advertising prices. Several . news outlets reported that staff members at the Federal Trade . Commission are preparing to recommend that the agency file an antitrust . lawsuit against the search giant. A majority of the five FTC commissioners would have to approve a suit before legal action could proceed. The reports from The New York Times, Bloomberg News and Reuters cited unnamed people briefed on the FTC's investigation. FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan declined to comment. The agency has been investigating Google's business practices. The . probe was triggered by complaints that Google Inc. has been . highlighting its peripheral services in its influential search results . and relegating offerings from its rivals to the back pages. The . FTC also has been looking into whether Google has rigged its results in . a way that has prodded websites to pay more to promote their services . through Google's advertising network. In a statement Friday, Google said, 'We are happy to answer any questions that regulators have about our business.' Google and other large internet . groups like Facebook provide free services to consumers and earn money . from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than . traditional TV or radio campaigns. Chris Watson, a lawyer at CMS Cameron . McKenna LLP, said: 'Google is being very aggressive and are playing for . high stakes because these (privacy policy) changes are very valuable to . their advertising business. 'They may be prepared to test the legal position in Europe to see what they can get away with.' The tussle with the EU over data privacy comes at a delicate time for Google. Europe's antitrust authorities are . also examining the company's business model to see if it uses its clout . in search advertising to favour its own services over competitors' offerings. The firm has been in negotiations with the European Commission for several months solutions to its alleged anti-competitive behaviour by promoting its own products ahead of rivals' in search results.

"Murdered baby: The two-month-old had been left in the back of his father's car as the man lit a fire to warm up his shop . Millions of angry Chinese are demanding the death penalty for a thief who murdered a two-month-old baby he found in the back of a  car he stole. The outrage threatens to upstage the ongoing National People’s Congress in which new Chinese leader Xi Jinping will officially take over the presidency. The thief, Zhou Xijun, jumped into the SUV parked outside a shop in the north-eastern city of Changchun on Monday and sped off. Police say that on hearing the cries of baby Haobo in the back seat, he panicked and strangled the boy then buried him in roadside snow. The baby’s father had left the engine of his Toyota RAV4 running after he dashed into his shop to light a fire before bringing his son inside. The child’s disappearance led to a huge two-day search involving 8,000 police and thousands of volunteers. Zhou, 48, handed himself in and  confessed late on Tuesday. But although Haobo’s clothes and blanket have been found, his body has yet to be recovered. Under Chinese law, Zhou could escape the death penalty for murder because he handed himself in and instead may receive a life sentence. China’s popular social media sites Sina and Weibo have been inundated with 5million posts calling for Zhou to be executed. Many said they are also mourning the death of a caring society and fear three decades of headlong economic growth has left a moral vacuum in its wake. In a series of emotional TV appeals dad Xu said: 'Please, please don't hurt my boy. Do what you want with the car, but give us back our boy. 'The baby was crying and screaming and I thought he would give me away,' brutal Zhou Xijun, 48, told police. 'So I stopped the car, strangled the baby and buried his body in the snow,' added the killer, now facing the death penalty.

"Grace Dunham, the younger sister of  Lena Dunham appears to have finally responded on Twitter to claims that she was molested as a child by the Girls creator. They appear to address a claim by right-wing website Truth Revolt last week, accusing her older sister of sexual abuse. The website  cited an excerpt Lena Dunham's recently-published collection of personal essays 'Not That Kind of Girl' as 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'. In the extract Lena writes about looking at her one-year-old sister's vagina out of curiosity when she was seven. Today her Grace apparently condemned the article in a series of tweets. Scroll down for video . Grace Dunham (left) has come out to respond to claims her older sister Lena (right), creator and actress of HBO's Girls, sexually abused her when they were children. Grace pictured at the premiere of the film Obvious CHild on the left, her sister pictured promoting her book 'Not That Kind of Girl' in London on October 31 . Grace writes that she supports writers 'narrating their own experiences, determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful'. She also posted: '2day, like every other day, is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women, queer, and trans people.' While the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister's essay, they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world. The sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the Truth Revolt article, according to one tweet Lena wrote on Saturday. 'Sometimes I get so mad I burn write up. Also, I wish my sister wasn't laughing so hard,' Dunham tweeted on November 1. The passage that Truth Revolt called out details a conversation Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs. In the course of the conversation, 7-year-old Lena then asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers. 'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds . The Dunham sisters, Grace (left) and Lena (right), pictured at the premiere of Lena's film Tiny Furniture in New York on November 9, 2010. The sisters pictured again in a happy snap posted on Lena's Instagram a year and a half ago . 'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes . 'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked. 'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!” 'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 'She just on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.' Truth Revolt  responded excerpted the essay and other parts of her the book in an article titled 'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister' The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. Obviously upset with being named as a child molester, Dunham took to Twitter on Saturday to lash out at Truth Revolt for their damaging article three days after it was published. The website has refused to apologize for the article, and it still appears prominently on their home page.","Grace Dunham wrote a series of tweets on Monday .

"Clutching a walking stick for support, Andrew Marr returned to front his BBC politics show today- nine months after a massive stroke almost ended his life. His return today was welcomed with the support of viewers and guests including Chancellor George Osborne, shadow defence secretary Douglas Alexander and Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu. Marr was left with seriously impaired mobility down his left side after suffering a serious stroke overnight in January. Andrew Marr returned to his BBC television programme today to the delight of guests and viewers . The broadcaster received a touching gesture of support from one of his guests, . Dr Sentamu who grasped his impaired left arm, and he . would pray for his recovery. The tender moment came at the end of . their interview when Marr, 53, referred to the Archbishop’s own recent . battle with prostate cancer and said: ‘You’ve also been ill so it’s very . wonderful to see you back as well, may I say?’ The . Archbishop replied: ‘I just want to say what happened to me when I had . this terrible illness, friends prayed for me, prayers encouraged me and I . just hope the same thing will happen to you.' Dr Sentamu then . held Marr’s left arm and in a reference to the biblical story of a man . with a ‘withered’ hand who was healed by Jesus on the Sabbath. Dr John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York touches Andrew Marr's weakened hand in a gesture of support. The Archbishop said he would pray for Mr Marr's recovery . Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne appeared on The Andrew Marr Show today to review the parliamentary vote on Syria . He said: . ‘Like in Luke Chapter 6, we had the man with a hand like yours. Jesus . you know raises it up. And I’m going to... and I’m going to work hard, . I’m going to work there that your hand begins to work. And nice to see . you back.' Mr Marr replied: ‘Needs some work on it, needs some work on it. Thank you so much, Archbishop.’ The day before suffering the near fatal stroke, Mr Marr said he had been struck by a ‘blinding headache and flashes of light’ as he finished a vigorous workout on a rowing machine at home in East Sheen, south-west London. Doctors later discovered he had torn the carotid artery. Mercifully, the area of the brain that controls speech and memory was unaffected. The presenter spent two months in hospital and has undergone intense physiotherapy to regain movement in his left arm and leg, the latter of which has recovered more quickly. The Chancellor of the Exchequer appeared on the show as well as shadow defence secretary, Douglas Alexander . Marr, a father-of-three, had planned to return full-time to his show this month so as to coincide with the ‘natural beginning of the political year’. Today's comeback followed a brief appearance on the show in early July, when he pre-recorded a ten-minute interview with David Milliband, the former Labour Foreign Secretary. Guest presenters such as Jeremy Vine, Sophie Raworth and Eddie Mair had been standing in for the former BBC political editor and newspaper editor. Wearing a blue suit, white shirt and gold tie, Marr stood with the walking stick in his right hand to introduce the show today. He told viewers: ‘Well, here we are again. I have to start this morning with a few ‘thank yous’, to all my excellent colleagues who have been keeping the show on the road. Daily Mail columnist Amanda Platell and historian Simon Schama reviewed the sunday newspapers with Andrew Marr on today's programme . ‘Thanks also to all the many viewers who’ve sent so many kind and wise messages. And thanks, last but not least, to all of you who were frankly pleased to see the back of me but never quite got round to writing to say so. Thank you for that as well.’ In a newspaper interview published ahead of his return on Friday, the veteran journalist said he was ‘slightly nervous’ about returning to the politics, current affairs and culture show, but added: ‘I’m physically fine - my left arm is still quite weak, I walk with a bit of a hobble - but mentally I am fine and that’s hopefully all that matters.’ Other guests on the hour-long programme included Chancellor George Osborne and shadow defence secretary Douglas Alexander.

"Gun elite: Met poster girl Carol Howard with weapons and armour . A black firearms officer who was once Scotland Yard's Olympics security poster girl was bullied by an officer who spied on her through CCTV and Facebook, a tribunal heard yesterday. Carol Howard, 34, is suing the Metropolitan Police for racial and sexual discrimination, claiming she was intimidated by an 'aggressive' inspector. She said he had once 'scolded' her in front of other senior officers while he was armed with a Taser and a handgun, reducing her to tears. Yesterday Miss Howard cut a glamorous figure as she arrived at the Central London Employment Tribunal. The elite Diplomatic Protection Group officer, who helped safeguard London from terror attacks during the 2012 Games, claims she was picked on by a supervisor who monitored her Facebook account where she had posted images of herself in a bikini. The tribunal heard that Acting Inspector Dave Kelly also spied on her through CCTV. Miss Howard was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 when the Met chose her to be a poster girl for a magazine feature on the 10,000 men and women on duty during the Olympics. But yesterday the hearing was told that behind the scenes she was often seen in tears by colleagues. PC Gary Flaherty, who worked with her, said he saw her upset on several occasions as a result of the alleged bullying. In his statement to the tribunal, he said that once in 2012 she was called into the sergeants' room by Mr Kelly, and was scolded by him in front of three other sergeants. 'She told me he was armed with a Taser and a handgun, whereas she had just handed in all her weaponry, which was intimidating for her. She was visibly upset and in tears.' Mr Flaherty said Mr Kelly's attitude changed when he was promoted from sergeant in January 2012. PC Carol Howard, 34, a firearms officer with the Diplomatic Protection Group, alleges that her career has been held back because a senior male officer did not treat her equally because of her race and sex . 'It has been a long struggle and I just want justice to be done. I want the truth to come out,' the 10-year veteran said . He said: 'He got a reputation for . aggressive and intrusive management and for generally being a bully. I . have been told by other officers that they thought he used to follow . officers on post in a police car, turn the lights off and spy on them to . ensure they were at their post.' He . added that he did not 'personally witness' any of the events that Miss . Howard raised, but added: 'I saw her become upset on several occasions . which she told me was  a result of… Kelly's actions.' Schona . Jolly, representing Miss Howard, asked the witness: 'She told you in . terms that she felt he was treating her badly because she was both black . and/or because she was a woman?' Mr . Flaherty replied: 'I think we discussed that on occasion, yes.' He . added that Mr Kelly, who is now a sergeant again, had gone 'far and . beyond' the treatment meted out to other officers. Miss . Howard has served in the force for ten years. Outside the tribunal she . said: 'It has been a long struggle and I just want justice to be done.' The Met said it would 'robustly defend' itself against Miss Howard's claims. The hearing continues. The 34-year-old's case is being funded by the Police Federation and has been going on for two years . Last week Commissioner Sir Bernard . Hogan-Howe called for a change in the law to allow positive . discrimination to recruit more black and ethnic minority officers. Scotland Yard will have to recruit an . ethnic minority officer for every white officer they take on, under . radical plans to shake off its reputation for racism in the ranks. In the wake of accusations that the Metropolitan Police is still ‘institutionally racist’, the boss wants to change the predominantly white male make-up of the force with a radical five year recruitment blitz of 50/50 ethnic minority officers to white officers. He wants to emulate a controversial Northern Ireland model which saw a temporary change in the law to allow one Catholic officer recruited for every Protestant officer when the Police Service of Northern Ireland formed in 2001. Currently the Metropolitan Police is only recruiting one in five officers from ethnic minorities. The hearing is being held at Central London Employment Tribunal in Holborn in central London .","Carol Howard, 34, claims a senior officer has held back her career .

"Zola Tongo, 34, who is serving an 18-year term, was giving evidence in the trial of Shrien Dewani, who is accused of arranging the murder of his wife . The taxi driver who is in jail for the murder of newlywed Anni Dewani in South Africa claims he fitted child locks on his car to prevent her escaping, a South African court has been told. Zola Tongo, 34, who is serving an 18-year term, was giving evidence in the trial of Shrien Dewani, a bisexual entrepreneur from Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol. Dewani has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnap, robbery with aggravating circumstances, conspiracy to commit these crimes and defeating the ends of justice at Western Cape High Court in Cape Town. Dewani claims the couple were hijacked as Tongo was driving them through Gugulethu township in his minibus on November 13. He was released unharmed and Anni was driven away. She was found shot dead in the abandoned minibus the next morning. It is alleged he arranged the murder of his wife through Tonga. The information concerning the child locks, which prevent a passenger in the rear of the car from leaving, was not in Tongo's original statement, and the driver told the court he had only just remembered it. Dewani's defence lawyer Francois van Zyl said: 'You engaged the child locks.' Tongo said: 'Correct' Van Zyl added: 'That means the accused wouldn't be able to get out.' Tongo added: 'Correct. But I knew they (the gunmen) would do nothing to the accused person.' The court also heard it was 'strange' the taxi driver did not ask Dewani when he would be paid for killing the businessman's wife. Van Zyl had tried to find out what arrangements  Tongo allegedly made with his client regarding a 5,000 rand (£283) payment for Anni Dewani's murder on Saturday November 13 2010. Dewani (pictured left in court) was released unharmed and Anni was driven away. She was found shot dead in the abandoned minibus the next morning . According to the prosecution, Dewani's secret gay life and the reputation of his family motivated him to order the contract killing of his new bride, Anni, 28, pictured above, during their honeymoon to South Africa . Tongo said during cross-examination he and Dewani spoke about his commission the day the couple landed in Cape Town, and was told the murder needed to happen the next day. He said he could not remember discussing how he would be paid, which Mr Van Zyl said he found strange because Tongo had described the payment as important. He added he did not know how long Dewani would be in the country. Mr van Zyl said: 'For all you knew, he could have left Cape Town on Sunday morning. You made no arrangements with him as to when and how you would be paid.' After more questions, it was revealed Tongo did not ask about the alleged commission when he and Dewani were sitting together at the Cape Grace Hotel on Sunday morning, hours before Anni's body was found. Tongo said he did not ask because the hotel was busy. The information concerning the child locks, which prevent a passenger in the rear of the car (pictured) from leaving, was apparently not in Tongo's original statement . Mr van Zyl asked Tongo if he tried to get in contact with Dewani before he left the country the following Tuesday. Tongo said he did not. Mr van Zyl said it was only through coincidence that the pair spoke, when Tongo phoned a police officer to complain about journalists bothering him. Tongo did not realise Dewani was in the officer's company. Dewani asked the officer if he could speak to Tongo over the phone. Asked again why Tongo did not try to get hold of Dewani, he eventually said he did not have his contact number. When it was pointed out to him that nothing prevented him from phoning Dewani's hotel, Tongo said he had not thought of that. The prosecution alleges Dewani conspired with others to stage the hijacking in return for 15,000 rand (£847). Anni Dewani's body was found in Tongo's abandoned shuttle taxi in Khayelitsha on Sunday November 14, 2010. Middleman Monde Mbolombo, a hotel receptionist, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying against his accomplices. Xolile Mngeni is serving life in jail for firing the shot that killed Anni, but died in prison from a brain tumour on October 18. Mziwamadoda Qwabe is serving a 25-year jail term.","Zola Tongo, 34, was giving evidence in trial of Shrien Dewani in Cape Town .

Wilfried Zaha returns to Crystal Palace after Eagles seal £6m permanent transfer . Milton Keynes 4-0 Manchester United. August 26, 2014. A dark day in the history of one of Europe's great clubs, and a dark day for Louis van Gaal. Many poked fun at United's plight after the Capital One Cup fixture, but since that game, Van Gaal has got down to work in removing the outcasts from his squad. In fact, Wilfried Zaha and Saidy Janko's departures on transfer deadline day mean that half of the players who made the trip to stadium:MK have since left the club.

Five months on, and his revolution is in full swing.  Only David de Gea, Jonny Evans, Reece James and Nick Powell from the starting XI have survived the Dutch manager's axe. Michael Keane started at centre back that day but is now at Burnley, Marnick Vermijl plies his trade at Sheffield Wednesday, Javier Hernandez and Shinji Kagawa signed for Real Madrid and Dortmund on loan respectively, Danny Welbeck was a summer deadline day departure to Arsenal, while Anderson has left the club and looks set to join Internacional. Janko is highly thought of at Old Trafford and his loan move to Bolton should be more a process of getting minutes, rather than giving up hope on the 19-year-old Swiss youth international. Ben Amos, an unused substitute in Milton Keynes, has also been called upon by Wanderers on an emergency goalkeeping loan. But it is another case from the bench from that day that has drawn most attention; Zaha's permanent switch to Crystal Palace being confirmed.

'Zaha's application and attitude – at least among last season's management set-up at United – was never considered to be right,' Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman says. The winger, who has impressed in south London where he was brought up this season, managed just 28 Premier League minutes with United under David Moyes - 22 against Newcastle and six against Aston Villa. Since then, Van Gaal has usually stuck to picking his best players available, albeit with introducing a few new faces alongside his seasoned pros. Victories at Yeovil and a draw at Cambridge were accomplished with near full-strength XIs, indicating Van Gaal just doesn't trust the majority of his squad. Once you fail an audition like many did against MK Dons, you're out the door. United finished deadline day with just one signing, the virtually unknown full back Andy Kellett on loan from Bolton, but the summer is expected to be much busier for Ed Woodward and Van Gaal. By then his revolution may well be complete. Bolton confirmed that Saido Janko (l) has arrived on loan with Andy Kellett (r) heading to Manchester United .

"Vice President Biden apologized on Wednesday for  describing predatory bankers who loan money to U.S. troops as 'Shylocks' in a speech the day before, calling it a 'poor choice of words.' The term, which derives from the name of a vicious money-lending character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice', is considered anti-Semitic, and Biden had been criticized on Tuesday by the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, for his comment. Foxman said Biden 'should have been more careful' when speaking at a conference marking the 40th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation. Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the kickoff of the Nuns on the Bus tour on Wednesday at the Statehouse in Des Moines, Iowa. Biden apologized on Wednesday, via a written statement, for claiming the day before that predatory money lenders were 'Shylocks' Biden greets supporters with Sister Simone Campbell, left. During his speech on Wednesday Biden may have accidentally made another racial slur when he described a Singapore politician as being 'the wisest man in the Orient' Vice President Biden signs hins name on the Nuns on the Bus tour bus during a stop on Wednesday in Des Moines . 'When someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden, uses the term ""Shylocked"" to describe unscrupulous moneylenders dealing with service men and women, we see once again how deeply embedded this stereotype about Jews is in society,' Foxman said. In a statement provided to Business Insider on Wednesday, Biden described Foxman as a longtime 'friend and advisor' and said he agreed with his assessment. 'He’s correct, it was a poor choice of words, particularly as he said coming from ""someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden."" 'He’s right,' Biden said. Biden had been praising the Legal Services Corporation during the Washington speech - a group which provides lawyers to people who could not otherwise afford them - during the otherwise rudimentary speech on Tuesday when he made the offending remark. Recounting how people would speak to his son, Beau, about financial and legal difficulties when he was serving in Iraq, Biden said: 'People would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being... I mean these Shylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas.' Biden rode with the nuns to the Waveland Cafe in Des Moines and had lunch with them . Shylock was the antagonist in Shakespeare's c.1596 play 'The Merchant of Venice', a romantic comedy centred around the merchant Antonio, but of which Shylock is by far the most famous and memorable character. He was a Jewish money lender, and the villainous nature of his character has raised questions as to whether Shakespeare held anti-Semitic views. Shylock is defeated at the end of the play, and forced to convert to Christianity. The word came to represent a negative stereotype of Jewish people as heartless or demanding creditors. Shylock, 'The Merchant of Venice's' chief villain, is one of the most hated characters in all of Shakespeare's plays, and his name came to be associated with negative stereotypes of Jewish people. In the play, Shylock memorable demands a 'pound of flesh' from the merchant Antonio if he does not repay a loan. Bidenmay have made yet another offensive comment on Wednesday when he stated at an event in Iowa that a politician from Singapore was the 'wisest man in the Orient. The Vice President is known for making race-related slip-ups, having described Barack Obama in 2007 as 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,'' And while talking about his home state of Delaware in 2006, he said: 'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.'","Term comes from Shakespeare villain and is considered anti-Semitic .

"Ancient legends of Viking mariners using mysterious sunstones to reveal the position of the sun on a cloudy day may well be true, according to a new study. Before the invention of the compass, Norse adventurers travelled thousands of kilometres across the oceans toward Greenland and most likely as far as North America centuries ahead of Christopher Columbus. Evidence shows that these fearless seamen navigated by reading the position of the sun and stars along with an intimate knowledge of landmarks, currents and waves. Inventive: A new study claims to have revealed how the Vikings were able to navigate on cloudy days with a sunstone . But how they could voyage such distances across seas at northern latitudes while hampered by light obscuring clouds and fog remained a mystery. While experts have long argued that Vikings knew how to use blocks of light-fracturing crystal to locate the sun through dense clouds, archeologists have never found solid proof. Doubts also remained as to exactly what kind of material it might be. An international team of researchers led by Guy Ropars of the University of Rennes in Brittany, says they have the answer. Ancient-day sat nav: The refractive properties of calcite crystal - otherwise known as Iceland spar - were used to pinpoint the sun through clouds . According to the new study, the Vikings would have relied upon the sun's piercing rays being reflected through a piece of the calcite crystal. Researchers found that if you put a dot on top of the crystal and look through it from below, two dots will appear due to the double refraction of the Iceland spar. Using this, they could pinpoint the sun by rotating the crystal until both sides of the double image are of equal intensity. At that angle, the upward-facing surface indicates the direction of the sun, according to the scientists led by Dr Guy Ropars. A precision of a few degrees can be reached even under dark twilight conditions, so the Vikings would have been able to determine with precision the direction of the hidden Sun. The human eye, he added, has a fine-tuned capacity to distinguish between shades of contrast, and thus is able to see when the two spots are truly identical. Vikings, they argue, used transparent calcite crystal - also known as Iceland spar - to fix the true bearing of the Sun to within a single degree of accuracy. The naturally occurring stone has the capacity to 'depolarise' light, filtering and fracturing it along different axes, the researchers explained. The recent discovery of an Iceland spar aboard an Elizabethan ship sunk in 1592 - tested by the researchers - bolsters the theory that ancient mariners were aware of the crystal's potential as an aid to navigation. Even in the era of the compass, crews might have kept such stone on hand as a backup, the study speculates. 'We have verified that even only one of the cannons excavated from the ship is able to perturb a magnetic compass orientation by 90 degrees,' the researchers wrote. 'So, to avoid navigation errors when the Sun is hidden, the use of an optical compass could be crucial even at this epoch, more than four centuries after the Viking time.' The study appeared in Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal published by Britain's de facto academy of science, the Royal Society.

"Three South Florida attorneys will represent a man accused of killing his wife and then posting pictures of her body on Facebook. A judge on Friday approved a request for preservation of evidence in the case against 31-year-old Derek Medina. The attorneys took over from the Public Defender's Office, which initially represented Medina. Authorities say Medina posted a Facebook status on August 8 in which he confessed to killing 26-year-old Jennifer Alfonso. Moments later, a gruesome photo appeared on the page of a woman slumped on the floor. Medina later told police he had gotten into an argument with Alfonso that day. Prisoner: Derek Medina, who is charged with murder in the death of his wife Jennifer Alfonso, reported to court for a hearing on Friday . Defense: Medina consults with a lawyer at a court appearance in Miami . Medina sat silently in court at Friday's hearing, wearing a red jumpsuit and shackles around his wrists and ankles. According to the Miami Herald, it's likely the preservation of evidence order is to allow Medina's lawyers to photograph markings such as cuts and bruises on Medina's body. It is presumed Medina will claim the killing was in self-defense. Medina . is facing charges of first-degree murder after he posted a message on . his personal Facebook account Thursday morning, allegedly admitting to . the murder of his wife. 'Im . going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys . miss you guys take care Facebook people you will see me in the news,' he . wrote. 'My wife was punching me and I am not going to stand anymore with the abuse so I did what I did I hope u understand me.' Medina . posted the photo apparently showing his murdered spouse lying in the . kitchen with blood covering her face and left arm with the comment: 'Rip . Jennifer Alfonso.' He later told police that he shot Ms Alfonso several times after she picked up a kitchen knife, and punched and kicked him. Domestic abuse: There is speculation Medina's legal team will claim the killing was in self-defense . In . his affidavit, Medina said he had pointed a gun at his wife as they . argued in their bedroom. Later he confronted his wife, who said he was . leaving him, in their kitchen, according to CBS News. The . affidavit claims Ms Alfonso started to hit him so he went back upstairs . for the gun, as his wife reached for a kitchen knife. He told police he disarmed his wife but when she started to punch him again he shot her several times. Medina's father, Derek, to whom he confessed to shortly after the shooting, told the Miami Herald: 'They are making my son out to be a . monster and it was the other way around. She pushed him to the point of insanity.' The victim's family however, described Medina as controlling, claiming that he pressured her to leave her job. One man, who would give his name only . as Joe, said Medina was prone to violent outbursts. He claimed he once . saw Medina threaten a woman with a gun after she accidentally spilled . beer, and said Medina used to stalk members of a softball team they both . played on. Medina was denied bail by a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge. MailOnline chose to obscure the Facebook image due to its extremely graphic and disturbing nature. Denied: A Miami-Dade Circuit court judge denied Medina bail earlier this month after he allegedly admitted to murdering his wife on Facebook on August 8 .

Medina was a part-time extra on the USA . Network show Burn Notice. The . wannabe star boasted online about his tiny bit-part appearances and . dreamed of fame that he never quite attained. He appeared only as a . backgound extra with his head-shaved and pouting in two episodes in . 2010. However, that didn't stop him talking up his achievements. Posting . a video on YouTube, he narrated: 'Put on USA, I’m coming out on the . episode right now. I’m on USA. I’m going to come out soon. This is the . episode that I filmed. That’s me right there!

The page also has a clip of a man kicking a punching bag in a gym. In an interview with the local station WSVN, Medina's father, Derek Medina Sr., said that his son came to him at around 11am Thursday and admitted to shooting his wife. ‘He just said that his wife picked up a knife on him, and they had a big fight, and he shot her,’ said the father. The elder Medina drove his son to a South Miami police station, where the 31-year-old turned himself in. Derek . Medina Sr. said that the girl who was removed from the apartment wrapped in a . blanket is Ms Alfonso’s daughter from a previous relationship. According . to the father, his son had a rocky relationship with Ms Alfonso. He . said that the two got a divorce after being married for three years, but . remarried again last year.

Tragic twist: when police arrived at the couple's home, they found Alfonso's 10-year-old daughter and led her out wrapped in a blanket . Ms Alfonso listed her occupation as a server at Denny's. Records show that she married Medina in April 2012. The . woman was last active on Facebook on Wednesday, about 15 hours before . the image of her body appeared on her husband's page. At the time, .

"A copy of the letter which was sent be Dennis Giemsch seeking the addresses of  Jews in town . A neo-Nazi party has demanded to know where all Jews in the city of Dortmund live in a chilling echo of the build-up to the Holocaust. Die Rechte – The Right – wrote to mayor Ullrich Sierau through one of its councillors, Dennis Giemsch, seeking to know how many Jews live in and around the town, and their addresses. He asked that the information be supplied at a meeting of the council in the town hall on Wednesday night. The demand was refused and the letter has been passed to the interior ministry of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is looking at ways to legally ban the party. Full-time computer student Giemsch said the information was 'relevant for our political work'. Die Rechte is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young. The echoes of the terror that was unleashed on Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933 is not lost on Jews everywhere in Germany because the Holocaust of six million began with their registration, their numbers and where they lived. Die Rechte has been under the watchful eye of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the domestic intelligence service, since it was founded two years ago from the rump of an old neo-Nazi party. It is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young. In the party programme it swears to protect the 'German identity,' ban English words in advertising, 'protect' German culture, limit immigration, kick out foreigners convicted of crimes, support 'German' families to have 'German' children, widen police powers of arrest and protect animals. Most of their manifesto can be found in a similar form from that of Hitler's National Socialists back in the 1920's. Jewish people in Dortmund have reacted with alarm to the demand of the party to know where they reside and how many of them there are. One told a local newspaper: 'This is how it all began before. I don't think it will come to that again but such things evoke terrible memories. I hope this will be used by the authorities as a building block in future legislation to ban them.' The echoes of the terror that was unleashed on Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933 is not lost on Jews everywhere in Germany because the Holocaust of six million began with the registration of where they lived .","Die Rechte wrote to Mayor Ullrich Sierau to ask how many Jews live nearby .

"Preston North End 1-3 Manchester United. It wasn't pretty, and it was far from easy. What Louis van Gaal could have done with, was a striker on top form. Preston aren't a bad side - they're fourth in League One and real contenders for promotion to the second tier of English football - but the might of Manchester United should have brushed them aside with ease. Radamel Falcao should have brushed them aside with ease. Preston took the lead just after half-time, and they were in with a real chance of progressing to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup until Ander Herrera got the ball rolling, and Marouane Fellaini put them ahead. No Falcao in sight. Radamel Falcao has abuse hurled at him by Preston fans as he makes his way off the pitch to be substituted . Ashley Young (right) replaced Falcao after an hour of the match - the Colombian did not make an impact . Marouane Fellaini (right), who scored United's second, shrugs his shoulders at his team-mate . Van Gaal and United have a big decision to make regarding the future of the Colombian - he will cost them £43million if they decide to make his loan a permanent deal - and if Monday night is anything to go by, he doesn't seem worthy of the mega-bucks he is currently being paid. On 60 minutes, with Preston leading 1-0, Falcao was hauled off in place of Ashley Young. One hour, zero goals, zero shots. There have been flashes since he made his Old Trafford debut in September. Four goals, a handful of decent performances, and a brief sign of what he could bring to the Premier League. But not enough. There are rumours that he's unhappy with life at United; his agent Jorge Mendes took a swipe at Van Gaal last week, claiming that Falcao would've been better under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson. Falcao's heat map shows the story of his match - the Colombian striker hardly made an impact . The 29-year-old touches vs Preston are shown (left) while his stats (right) show zero shots in the entire match . 'Falcao is a champion,' Mendes said. 'Recently he was being the best player of the match and after 70 minutes... there are things I don't want to discuss further.' Mendes refers to his substitution, much like the scenario he faced after an hour against Preston on Monday night. Except he was far from the best player on the pitch on this occasion. Falcao looked bemused as the fourth official held up a big red No 9, as though he didn't expect a change. As though United weren't 1-0 down against League One opposition with half an hour remaining. Sportsmail columnist and former Arsenal and England defender Martin Keown, who was commentating on the match for the BBC, said: 'I wonder if we'll ever see him again in a United shirt. He's offered nothing to his team tonight.' Wayne Rooney (right) and Falcao watch on as they wait to kick off in the FA Cup against Preston . Louis van Gaal shakes Falcao's hand after he is substituted - the United manager has a big decision to make . The 29-year-old was left out of Van Gaal's squad to face Southampton in January - he's not immune to exclusion - and it wouldn't be a surprise if Robin van Persie gets the nod instead of him come the weekend, when United travel to Swansea. There are 13 Premier League matches left of the season, before Falcao's future is decided. It's a gamble whichever way Manchester United decide to go. There is certainly talent there; Falcao has more than proved that in his successful career to date, at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco. But it just isn't working for him in England. These things take time, but time, and £43m, might be luxuries United aren't willing to afford.","Radamel Falcao played an hour against Preston, but didn't have a shot .

"A man suspected of having Ebola who was rushed to hospital in Melbourne has reportedly been given the all clear. The patient was transported by Victoria Ambulance staff in full hazmat suits to Royal Melbourne Hospital on Thursday morning. It’s believed the man recently visited West Africa, Nine News reports. However, Royal Melbourne Hospital said the patient does not have Ebola after the man was picked up in Port Melbourne with reported symptoms. He has not tested positive for the virus.

'The middle aged man was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital in a stable condition. Paramedics took standard precautions used for infectious diseases, and used personal protection equipment. 'The man is not being treated as a suspected Ebola case.' This week Australia became the first Western country to ban visitors from Ebola-hit areas of Africa, amid warnings the restrictions could make it harder to fight the deadly disease. The government said it would refuse entry to anyone travelling from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leona - the countries most severely hit by the epidemic - despite there being no known cases of the virus in Australia. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament the government's processes were 'working to protect Australians'. Australia will not issue new visas and will cancel temporary ones. Those with permanent Australian visas yet to arrive in the country will only be allowed to fly after a 21-day quarantine before their departure.","Man was picked up from Port Melbourne in Victoria with symptoms .

"Tottenham face at least two years playing in Milton Keynes as they build their new stadium, the Mail on Sunday can reveal. The news will dismay Spurs fans, who must trek 50 miles to the land of concrete cows not just for a single campaign but for two seasons — maybe more. The nightmare scenario has been forced on Spurs because their stadium design won’t allow for the project to be built in phases. Tottenham could spend more than two years using MK Dons' home ground as their base . The north London club has to leave White Hart Lane while their stadium is built at the same site . Club officials recently admitted they would have to move out for a season when they receive the go-ahead to start building. However, the prospect of long-term displacement raises concerns Spurs could be forced to play in front of low crowds for a damaging period. Stadium:mk holds a little over 30,000 supporters. Spurs hope to receive the green light in January when a High Court hearing will look into a major challenge to their plans. Spurs fans will have to commute 48.3 miles from White Hart Lane for home games . Tottenham fans at White Hart Lane, which has a capacity of 36,284 . Work on the new stadium has been held back by a local business that has refused to move to make way for the development and has used its right to appeal against a CPO decision in July that went in favour of the club. Spurs recently confirmed delays meant they would not have a home stadium for the 2017-18 season, and would have to play home matches somewhere else. However, as well as the prospect of additional time away from White Hart Lane, there is growing acceptance from officials that the stadium project may not be ready to open until 2020-21.","Tottenham are to play home games at MK Dons home Stadium:mk .

"A photo posted by one of slain student-turned-alleged robber Claudia Hidic shows a different side to the 17-year-old who was shot in the head during an attempted home burglary. While her parents and relatives maintain that Claudia was a sweet aspiring actress, one of her friends posted a photo to a Facebook memorial page showing her flashing a rude gesture while wads of dollar bills are shown stuffed down her gym shorts and bra. Her body was found dumped by the kicked-in back door of a duplex apartment in Fort Worth, Texas almost two weeks ago and now police have the two men thought to be her accomplices in the attempted burglary. Curtis Fortenberry and Terrance Crumley, both 21-years-old, now face felony murder charges over the fatal incident. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"An Argentine woman has sparked outrage by agreeing to marry her twin sister’s killer. Edith Casas, 22, is due to wed Victor Cingolani today close to the jail where he is serving 13 years for the murder of model Johana Casas. Johana was shot dead days before her 20th birthday in August 2010 in the southern Argentine city of Pico Truncado, 1,200 miles south of the capital Buenos Aires. Killed: Victor Cingolani, right, was convicted of killing Johana Casas, left, in 2010 . Edith Casas, pictured, is guilty of a 'terrible betrayal', according to her mother . Cingolani, an ex-boyfriend, was convicted of murder in June. Edith's family said she is guilty of a 'terrible betrayal'. The controversial wedding will take place in Edith's home town in front of just two friends acting as witnesses. However, several armed police officers will also be present when they escort Cingolani from the city jail. Model Johana Casas was shot dead in 2010 days before her 20th birthday . The twins’ mother Marcelina last night claimed her surviving daughter was suffering psychological problems and said she feared Cingolani would take her life too. She said: 'There are no words to describe what Edith is going to do. She’s guilty of a terrible betrayal.' Edith, Cingolani’s girlfriend of five years, has insisted her future husband is the victim of a miscarriage of justice and is backing his appeal against his murder conviction. She said: 'Victor is not a violent person and I’m not mad. 'We’ve got no doubts about what we’re doing. We love each other.'

"Residents of Australia's tropical north know that you don't go swimming in the sea at night because that's when crocodiles are most dangerous. But French fisherman Yoann Galeran didn't know the rules and happily dived into the waters off Arnhem Land - which is why he ended up with his head firmly between the jaws of a saltwater croc. It dragged him underwater, with his head locked between its teeth and attempted a death roll in which victims are spun around until they drown. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Yoann Galeran 29, said he was swimming from shore to a dinghy when a crocodile clamped down on his head and neck and attempted to drown him . Escape: Mr Galeran had four puncture wounds on his head and was bleeding as he climbed aboard a dinghy to escape the crocodile . At the age of 29, however, Mr Galeran wasn't ready to die just yet and in dark and dangerous waters so far from home. 'I didn't think about dying - I thought only about fighting to stay alive,' he said back on his boat today after his ordeal. 'I just feel that I've been lucky and I just think if it was a bigger crocodile I maybe wouldn't have any head.' Mr Galeran intended to swim to a dinghy about 20 yards from the shore at Nhulunbuy in north-east Arnhem Land, east of Darwin, on a night when there was no moon. 'I was just a short way into the water . when it felt like a big stone or something coming on my head. I just . thought for sure it was a croc and I started to think the only thing to . do was to move my body as much as I could. Attack: My head was in the crocodile's mouth for less than a second, but it was long enough to give me two puncture wounds on the back of my neck' said Mr Galeran . 'He just hit me on the top, on the left side and on top of my neck and tried to push me down in the water.' Mr Galeran - Jo to his friends - said he managed to free his head by hitting the crocodile with his fists. 'I punch him anywhere I could,' he said. 'But his weight and the power of him swimming pulled me about a metre under the water. 'Under the water the crocodile began to spin me around.' In his broken English he said he hit the croc under its head, then pushed it away which gave him the chance to escape. 'My head was in the crocodile's mouth for less than a second, but it was long enough to give me two puncture wounds on the back of my neck and another three or four punctures on each side of my head.' Menacing: A Saltwater crocodile - it was not fully grown, estimated to be eight to 10 feet long, but it would have been strong enough to have taken Mr Galeran's head off if it had managed a better grip (file photo) Mr Galeran was also scratched on his back where the crocodile had tried to grip him with its claws. Once free, he swam frantically to the dinghy and climbed abroad, bleeding from his wounds. His work colleagues later took him to a medical centre for treatment. Mr Craig van Lawick, skipper of the fishing vessel on which Mr Galeran works said at first everyone thought the Frenchman was playing a joke. 'It wasn't until he got ashore and we saw the claret (blood) flowing that we realised it was real.' The crocodile was not fully grown, estimated to be eight to 10 feet long, but it would have been strong enough to have taken Mr Galeran's head off if it had managed a better grip. Mr Galeran's boss at a shipping company in the Northern Territory, Miss Lisa Heathcote, said he was extremely lucky. 'The crocodile has been lurking around the area for the past few weeks,' she said. 'It's got him by the head and rolled him and his instincts kicked in and he's just started to punch into it. It released him, but then it came back again. 'We've walked out on the back deck and Jo's standing there with a big grin on his face and blood pouring out of him.' Police officer Vicki Koum agreed Mr Galeran was 'very, very lucky that he managed to swim away - the outcome could have been a lot more dire. 'It's just a reminder that we live in the Territory and where there is water, we have crocodiles.' Mr Galeran was able to treat the incident with good humour today.","Yoann Galeran, 29, ended up with his head between the jaws of a crocodile .

"The U.S. government agreed to a police request to restrict more than 37 square miles of airspace surrounding Ferguson, Missouri, for 12 days in August for safety, but audio recordings show that local authorities privately acknowledged the purpose was to keep away news helicopters during violent street protests. On Aug. 12, the morning after the Federal Aviation Administration imposed the first flight restriction, FAA air traffic managers struggled to redefine the flight ban to let commercial flights operate at nearby Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and police helicopters fly through the area - but ban others. 'They finally admitted it really was to keep the media out,' said one FAA manager about the St. Louis County Police in a series of recorded telephone conversations obtained by The Associated Press. 'But they were a little concerned of, obviously, anything else that could be going on.' Scroll down for video . Shut out: The audio recordings  raise questions about whether police were trying to suppress aerial images of the Ferguson demonstrations and the police response by violating the constitutional rights of journalists . Victim: Protests erupted after Michael Brown, pictured, was shot in an altercation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson . At another point, a manager at the FAA's Kansas City center said police 'did not care if you ran commercial traffic through this TFR (temporary flight restriction) all day long. They didn't want media in there.' FAA procedures for defining a no-fly area did not have an option that would accommodate that. 'There is really ... no option for a TFR that says, you know, ""OK, everybody but the media is OK,""' he said. The managers then worked out wording they felt would keep news helicopters out of the controlled zone but not impede other air traffic. The conversations contradict claims by the St. Louis County Police Department, which responded to demonstrations following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, that the restriction was solely for safety and had nothing to do with preventing media from witnessing the violence or the police response. Police said at the time, and again as recently as late Friday to the AP, that they requested the flight restriction in response to shots fired at a police helicopter. But police officials confirmed there was no damage to their helicopter and were unable to provide an incident report on the shooting. On the tapes, an FAA manager described the helicopter shooting as unconfirmed 'rumors.' The AP obtained the recordings under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. They raise serious questions about whether police were trying to suppress aerial images of the demonstrations and the police response by violating the constitutional rights of journalists with tacit assistance by federal officials. Officer: Charges have so far not been filed against Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown . Blocked: Audio recordings show that local authorities privately acknowledged the purpose of the no-fly zone was to keep away news helicopters during violent street protests . Such images would have offered an unvarnished view of one of the most serious episodes of civil violence in recent memory. 'Any evidence that a no-fly zone was put in place as a pretext to exclude the media from covering events in Ferguson is extraordinarily troubling and a blatant violation of the press's First Amendment rights,' said Lee Rowland, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney specializing in First Amendment issues. An FAA manager urged modifying the flight restriction so that planes landing at Lambert still could enter the airspace around Ferguson. The less-restrictive change practically served the authorities' intended goal, an FAA official said: 'A lot of the time the (lesser restriction) just keeps the press out, anyways. They don't understand the difference. The Kansas City FAA manager then asked a St. Louis County police official if the restrictions could be lessened so nearby commercial flights wouldn't be affected. The new order allows 'aircraft on final (approach) there at St. Louis. It will still keep news people out. ... The only way people will get in there is if they give them permission in there anyway so they, with the (lesser restriction), it still keeps all of them out.' 'Yeah,' replied the police official. 'I have no problem with that whatsoever.' KMOV-TV News Director Brian Thouvenot told the AP that his station was prepared at first to legally challenge the flight restrictions, but was later advised that its pilot could fly over the area as long as the helicopter stayed above 3,000 feet. That kept the helicopter and its mounted camera outside the restricted zone, although filming from such a distance, he said, was 'less than ideal.' None of the St. Louis stations was advised that media helicopters could enter the airspace even under the lesser restrictions, which under federal rules should not have applied to aircraft 'carrying properly accredited news representatives.' The FAA's no-fly notice indicated the area was closed to all aircraft except police and planes coming to and from the airport. Issues: Ferguson police were widely criticized for their response following the death of Brown, who was shot by Wilson on August 9 . Aerial images of what was happening in Ferguson would have offered an unvarnished view of one of the most serious episodes of civil violence in recent memory . 'Only relief aircraft operations under direction of St. Louis County Police Department are authorized in the airspace,' it said. 'Aircraft landing and departing St. Louis Lambert Airport are exempt.' The same day that notice was issued, a county police spokesman publicly denied the no-fly zone was to prevent news helicopters from covering the events. 'We understand that that's the perception that's out there, but it truly is for the safety of pilots,' Sgt. Brian Schellman told NBC News. Ferguson police were widely criticized for their response following the death of Brown, who was shot by a city police officer, Darren Wilson, on Aug. 9. Later, under county police command, several reporters were arrested, a TV news crew was tear gassed and some demonstrators were told they weren't allowed to film officers. In early October, a federal judge said the police violated demonstrators' and news crews' constitutional rights. A police captain wanted the no-fly zone extended when officials were set to identify Wilson by name as the officer who shot Brown and because Brown's funeral would 'bring out the emotions,' the recordings show . 'Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying and arresting reporters who are just doing their jobs,' President Barack Obama said Aug. 14, two days after police confided to federal officials the flight ban was secretly intended to keep media helicopters out of the area. 'The local authorities, including police, have a responsibility to be transparent and open.' The restricted flight zone initially encompassed airspace in a 3.4-mile radius around Ferguson and up to 5,000 feet in altitude, but police agreed to reduce it to 3,000 feet after the FAA's command center in Warrenton, Virginia, complained to managers in Kansas City that it was impeding traffic into St. Louis. The flight restrictions remained in place until Aug. 22, FAA records show. A police captain wanted it extended when officials were set to identify Wilson by name as the officer who shot Brown and because Brown's funeral would 'bring out the emotions,' the recordings show. 'We just don't know what to expect,' he told the FAA. 'We're monitoring that. So, last night we shot a lot of tear gas, we had a lot of shots fired into the air again. It did quiet down after midnight, but with that ... we don't know when that's going to erupt.' The recordings do not capture early conversations about the initial flight restriction imposed a day earlier, but they nonetheless show the FAA still approved and modified the flight restriction after the FAA was aware that its main intent was to keep the media away. One FAA official at the agency's command center asked the Kansas City manager in charge whether the restrictions were really about safety. 'So are (the police) protecting aircraft from small-arms fire or something?' he asked. 'Or do they think they're just going to keep the press out of there, which they can't do.'","The U.S. government agreed to a police request to restrict more than 37 square miles of airspace surrounding Ferguson, Missouri, for 12 days .

"A teenage girl who went on her first ever sea fishing trip caught a yellow fin tuna weighing 250lb, despite being more interested in sunbathing than catching fish. Five ft four Anna Meaden, had only ever been fly fishing for trout on a lake before she hooked the monster fish while visiting her father Paul on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. The 16-year-old was more interested in topping up her tan while on a day trip on a charter boat when she was persuaded to try her hand. The giant tuna caught by Anna Meaden, 16, off Ascension Island. Five ft four Anna Meaden, had only ever been fly fishing for trout on a lake before she hooked the monster fish . But Anna, who keeps fit playing rugby, was astounded when she hooked the giant fish within 20 minutes of putting a baited line into the ocean around 400 yards offshore. It was then an hour and 15 minutes of hard slog as she battled to reel in her monster catch as the fish fought to get away. The tuna was so big that it had to be lifted off the boat at Ascension Island capital Georgetown and placed on to a jetty by a US military crane. Anna of Campsea Ashe near Woodbridge, Suffolk, arranged for the fish to be filleted and divided up into hundreds of portions to be shared out among the islanders. She insisted that she had no interest in fishing before she was finally persuaded to take a trip out to sea with her father’s friends Colin Chester and Craig Hall, who own a charter boat. Anna who is on Ascension Island with her friend Georgina Paterson, 20, for a five week summer holiday, said: 'I came out here to see dad for a bit of a break. 'To be honest we weren’t that interested in fishing. We were just on the front of the boat sunbathing when Craig started calling and saying that we were going through some fish. So we went over and gave it a go. Five ft four Anna, had only ever been fly fishing for trout on a lake before she hooked the monster fish while visiting her father Paul on  Ascension Island in the South Atlantic . 'There were three rods set up and we got bites on two of them. Craig tried to reel in one and it cut loose after five minutes. 'A tiny American woman took the other rod to reel it in, but she was struggling and wore herself out after a couple of minutes. She said it was more difficult than giving birth to two children. 'I then took over and strapped myself into the harness with the rod in a holster in metal plate in front of me. The fish took out around 400m of line and I kept having to heave the rod back and then reel it in when there was a bit of slack. 'It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It took me an hour and 15 minutes to reel it in. I’ve got bruises up my arm from banging against the reel and bruises on my legs from the metal plates. 'It was quite a struggle and a lot harder than you think. Craig caught a similar sized one as well but it only took him 15 minutes. 'Finally, I got the fish close enough to the boat for the crew to gaff it and drag it on board. 'Then I finished it off by clubbing it on the head. I got quite aggressive with it because I was so exhausted at fighting it for so long.' Anna who is 5ft 4ins tall and plays as a tight head prop at Woodbridge Rugby Club, added: 'I have to keep fit to play rugby and I do a lot of training, so I am quite strong. I am sure that helped me. The tuna was so big that it had to be lifted off the boat at Ascension Island capital Georgetown and placed on to a jetty by a US military crane . 'I’ve definitely got a taste for it - not normal fishing but definitely charter as I think that’s a lot more interesting. 'I’m coming out again at Christmas and I’d like to catch a marlin. Because this is such a small place and the tuna was so big we were able to give a bag of the meat to almost everyone on the island.' Anna’s father Paul, who moved to the British overseas territory last May to work with the local police force after serving as a detective inspector with the Metropolitan Police in London, added: 'Unfortunately I wasn’t on the boat at the time. 'I was feeling quite proud and smug having recently caught a 231lb tuna, but Craig tells me that Anna made far less of a fuss about the fight than I did and that she’s a better fisherman all round.' Anna’s mother Helen who is also on Ascension Island said: 'She did incredibly well catching the fish. The locals were very excited because two big tuna had been caught by the same boat. 'Everyone here is impressed with her. She has appeared in the local newsletter and she is being treated like a celebrity. Her fish has been spread around freezers all over the island.'","Five ft four Anna Meaden was more interested in topping up tan than fishing .

"New pictures have revealed the devastating effect California’s historic drought is having on local reservoirs as some have reached all-time lows. Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought state of emergency last month to restrict water usage as some reservoirs have dipped down to below record lows. A strong storm brought flash floods to the California Thursday and another one just off the coast is expected to pummel the parched state with torrential rains, but that still may not be enough to bring watersheds back in line. Scroll down for video . Before: Lake Oroville is shown in July 2011 in all of its lush glory at 97 per cent capacity . After: The parched lake is shown last month at near record-low capacity . State officials said last month that snow pack water content, which supplies as much as a third of state water supplies after the spring thaw, is at only 20 per cent of yearly averages. Low snow pack combined with record low rains and a growing population has spelled disaster for the Golden State. Photos released by the California Department of Water Resources show the staggering lengths to which the water supply has been depleted. The most striking was a comparison of Folsom Reservoir, near Sacramento, at 97 per cent capacity on July 20, 2011, and last month at only 17 per cent. Reservoirs statewide are at only 35 per cent of total capacity tied with 2008 for the lowest since at least 1999, according to state water officials. Reservoir levels were at 75 per cent going into October of last year, some reservoirs have seen surface water drops of more than 50 feet since. Bridge over land: What once connected two landmasses separated by water is now a bridge over a dirt path . Dire situation: Reservoirs statewide are off their record lows after recent storms, but they still have a long way to go before concerns are mitigated . Folsom has dropped low enough that a search party last month began looking for the wreckage of a plane that crashed almost 50 years ago. Though the summer-winter comparison drew flack for not allowing snow to melt and somewhat replenish the body of water, an official told Business Insider that the comparison was still important. The last time Folson was that low was in 1991, BI noted, when it hit only 16 per cent of capacity, but recent rain storms have brought it back to 30 per cent of capacity. Pictures of Lake Oroville, in the northern part of the state, reduced to what looks like a small river digging through a channel at the point a bridge crosses it. Now a river: What was once Lake Oroville now resembles a river at the point a bridge crosses it . Where's the lake?: Folsom Reservoir has dropped so low that crews began searching last month for the wreckage and bodies from a plane crash almost 50 years ago . Oroville dropped to 39 per cent of capacity, but has gone back up to 57 per cent after recent rains. Those rains appear to have drastically improved the plight of downstate reservoirs, as Pyramid Lake is at 98 per cent of capacity. Castaic Lake is at 84 per cent. The most drastic situations remain Pine Flat, at 19 per cent, and Exchequer, at 21 per cent. Those recent storms have brought much-needed drought relief, but they are also expected to cause their share of havoc as well. Staggering: Water has all but disappeared from some part of the lake as water levels have dropped more than 50 feet . Relief is on the way: A massive storm is off the coast of California and ready to pound the state with rain rates up to one inch per hour . Flood fears: Work crews in Azusa are laying down Jersey Barriers to try to prevent expected floods from washing homes away . Evacuations: Residents also laid sandbags down in front of their homes prior to following mandatory evacuation orders in Azusa . More than 1,000 homes in the Los Angeles foothills were evacuated for fears mudslides would wipe them out after a forest fire last month burned the slopes bare. Flash floods are feared to rip through Glendora and Azusa in the second round of severe rains that could drop as much as one inch per hour across the southern half of the state. It remains to be seen if these rains will be enough to life the drought emergency, but they should at least help ease concerns the state might run out of water. Pictures of the marina taken in July 2011 show verdant banks and a high water level, but by January this year the scene is barely recognizable as the same place . Since July 2011 the water has receded so far that huge sections of the lake bed have been revealed . Boats used to have more space to spread out on the lake but now they risk being left high and dry . Bare banks and low water levels have completely changed the look of this marina, since the top picture was taken in 2011 . In 2011 this bridge was needed to stretch across a large expanse of water but now it stands over a small stream . Water cascades down the Oroville dam in 2011 but in January this year the structure is no where near the water's edge .","California declared a drought state of emergency last month as statewide reservoir capacity dropped to 35 per cent .

"Stunned: Paul Seyfang was horrified after a thief stole his bike . A man who was knocked off his bike which was then stolen has spoken about his shock that someone could be so cruel while he lay dazed in the road. Cyclist Paul Seyfang said he thought he was going to die when he was hit by a car while riding home from work in Chelmsford, Essex. But rather than stop and help the 65-year-old, an opportunistic thief took the opportunity to pedal off on his £2,000 Marin mountain bike. Reliving the horrifying moment, he . said: 'I was travelling to my home when the car pulled out without . looking in my direction. I honestly thought I was going to die. 'The car was bearing down . on me and there's that moment when you can't help but think ""that's it . for me"". 'It hit me square-on and the middle of his bumper forced me and my bike to the ground and the car eventually came to a stop. 'It went over my legs as far as my knees, but thankfully he did brake enough to stop before I was killed. 'Afterwards . I was talking to the car driver and was in a bit of a daze and it was . then that I turned round to see that my bike had gone. 'I was stood there bleeding and that was when I realised that a very despicable person had stolen it.' The married father-of-three believes a rail passenger may have been responsible as a train had only just pulled into the nearby . station and dozens of people came past moments after the accident. Crime scene: Mr Seyfang was hit by an oncoming car in Chelmsford. The scene of the accident soon became the subject of a police investigation into the theft of his bike . He added: 'It all happened within a minute and there was no way that the thief did not realise that I had been in an accident. 'My . bike was damaged and I was stood there speaking the with driver who had . knocked me off, so they knew what had happened but just thought ""that's . an easy opportunity to get a new bike"". 'I never expected that I would have to lock up my bike after an accident and even the police officers who attended said they had never seen anything like this before.' Mr Seyfang suffered bruising to his kidney and spleen, cuts to his right leg and arm and pain in his back. He also banged his head and has had to have regular GP visits following the accident, which occurred at about 5.30pm on August 15.
