"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:49 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:17 EST, 5 February 2013 . A judge has granted media organizations' request for a hearing to discuss access to transcripts and court documents related to top secret proceedings in the Chandra Levy case. Judge Gerald Fisher scheduled a hearing for tomorrow on the issue brought by the media groups, including the Associated Press. He has held two recent hearings in the case and barred the public and press from hearing the majority of both proceedings, which took place after possible doubts of the key witness emerged. The man convicted of killing Levy may go free after doubts have surfaced over the credibility of a key witness. Fisher added that he has sealed a portion of the first hearing because of 'safety issues.' The media also want to attend another hearing scheduled for Thursday and future hearings. A Salvadoran man, Ingmar Guandique, was convicted of killing Levy in 2010. He is serving a 60-year prison sentence. It was reported last month that Guandique, 31, may have his conviction tossed out after doubts emerged over the credibility of a key witnesses' testimony. The disclosure led the judge to hold the secret hearings with prosecutors and lawyers for Guandique to discuss the case. Court records show the hearings have . taken place behind closed doors but neither prosecutors nor defense . lawyers have revealed the purpose of the sessions. Guandique always maintained his innocence in Levy's death. Even Levy's devastated parents are being kept in the dark over what was going on. 'Whether they have to have a new trial or have another suspect, or whatever, we don't know,' her dad, Robert Levy, told CBS News. 'They can't tell us because it's secret.' Chandra, whose case captured the nation's attention because of her affair with her married boss, California congressman Gary Condit. Though Condit, who is no longer in Congress, was interviewed by . investigators, authorities eventually ruled him out as a suspect and . don't believe he had anything to do with her death. Condit testified at trial that he had . no role in Levy's disappearance or death, but evaded questions about his . relationship with her. Guandique, an illegal immigrant . from El Salvador, was convicted in 2010 of killing Levy, but always maintained his innocence. Levy's remains . were found in 2002 in a heavily wooded area of Washington's Rock Creek . Park. Guandique's lawyers are accusing prosecutors of withholding evidence. Prosecutors acknowledged at the outset of the case that they had no physical evidence linking Guandique to Levy's death, but they argued at trial that the attack on Levy fit a pattern of attacks by Guandique on other female joggers in Rock Creek park around the same time she went missing. Their case also leaned heavily on the testimony of a former cellmate of Guandique, who claimed that Guandique admitted while behind bars to killing Levy. Guandique is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence. Robert Levy said, 'He's a convicted rapist and an illegal alien. He's not legal at all or . working or anything. He's just a criminal, so he shouldn't go free. 'But . if he's innocent of murder then he shouldn't be in jail for it.'","Secret hearings came after doubts were expressed about witness in the case, who said Ingmar Guandique killed Levy in 2001 .

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 05:10 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:46 EST, 1 February 2013 . Doctors encourage us to get our five fruit and veg a day - but one mother has to be incredibly careful which ones she eats... because the wrong choice could kill her. Charlotte Jefferson, 25, has a rare condition called salicylate sensitivity, which means she suffers itching, delirium and even coughs up blood if she eats certain foods. Salicylates are chemicals that occur naturally in many plants, including many fruits and vegetables. In high enough doses they are harmful to anyone, however most people can handle a certain amounts of salicylate in food. Scroll down for video . When Charlotte ate a pear with its peel on she was rushed to hospital itching and coughing up blood . But those with an intolerance often can't stomach even small amounts of salicylate in their diets. The mother-of-one has been hospitalised on several occasions after eating food such as tomatoes and pears. When she ate a pear, she was rushed to hospital itching and coughing up blood. After she ate some spices, her throat swelled up so much she could not breathe. Salicylates are chemicals found naturally in plants and in many pain relief medication such as aspirin. Sensitivity is rare and the severity of symptoms varies from person to person. These include headaches, an itchy skin rash, stomach pain, wheezing and trouble breathing. In severe cases it can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction than can cause loss of consciousness and organ failure. There is no cure and prevention is the best form of treatment by avoiding certain foods. Fruit with high levels of salicylates include apricots, avocados, blackberries, oranges, pineapples, plums, raisins and strawberries. Pears contain moderate levels if unpeeled and low levels if peeled. Vegetables with high levels include chillis, courgettes, gherkins, radishes and tomatoes. Spices to avoid include cayenne, curry powder and dill. Once after eating a tomato, Charlotte suffered from a severe headache, brought up blood and became delirious and disorientated. The 25-year-old said: 'I've been hospitalised so many times because of my condition. I'm worried if I had a pear or spice again, it could kill me.' Charlotte, who is mother to three-year-old Warren, was finally diagnosed with salicylate intolerance a few months ago. She must now avoid a long list of foods to avoid includes shellfish, canned and smoked meats, all fruits except bananas, broccoli, cucumber, pie fillings, vegetable oil, yoghurt, jam, fruit drinks, fizzy drinks, table sauces such as ketchup, most herbs and spices, biscuits, sweets and custard. She carries an EpiPen - a device containing a shot of adrenaline for emergency treatment. Before her diagnosis, Charlotte often ate foods she was intolerant to and had to phone for an ambulance to rush her to hospital. She now struggles to make meals for herself, knowing that many ingredients could be life-threatening. Charlotte, from Hull, said: 'It started when I was younger and my mum says as a baby I would projectile vomit. 'She had to keep changing my milk to find something I could have. Then as a child, I seemed to be okay, until I was about 15. 'I started getting really bad headaches . and being sick. When I had cola it would bubble back up into my mouth, . like when you shake up a can. Charlotte, 25, has had problems with food since she was a baby, but was only diagnosed a few months ago . 'If I go out with my friends, I have to phone the restaurant in advance and ask lots of questions about what they cook things in and how food is prepared. 'So many things are bad for me. Often I'll just have a bowl of porridge because it is the easiest thing to make. I'll sit having tea with Warren and he will say 'Mummy, why are you having breakfast?' Charlotte reacts differently to different foods - anything from a bad itch and headache to coughing up blood and suffering a swollen throat. She has thoroughly researched the condition on the internet, but the only place she can find currently investigating the disorder is a clinic in New Zealand. She said: 'I've been told I can be referred to a dietician, but different people suffer from intolerance to different foods. 'I was told I could eat pears - but one pear almost killed me. I'm suffering from depression because I cannot lead a normal life.' Charlotte's mother Candy Lee, 47, said she knew something was wrong when her daughter was a baby. She said: 'She used to projectile vomit all the time. She was my first child, so I didn't know if it was normal or not or what to do. 'I told the midwife and she said to keep trying her on different milks. Eventually we found one that was okay. 'It was very worrying though - she was dehydrated from all the vomiting.'","Charlotte Jefferson, 25, has a rare condition called salicylate sensitivity .

The number of sick days taken by stressed-out paramedics has soared by 40 per cent in two years. New figures released by ambulance trusts show they took 43,680 days off because of stress during 2011-12 compared with 31,268 in 2009-10. The number of ambulance workers suffering from stress has also increased by 42 per cent during the same period, from 728 to 1,035. Stressing out: New figures released by ambulance trusts show they took 43,680 days off because of stress during 2011-12 compared with 31,268 in 2009-10 . Union bosses say the widespread closure of hospital A&Es and rising numbers of 999 calls has taken its toll on ambulance crews, who are breaking down under the stress of the extra workload. Research by The Mail on Sunday has revealed 33 casualty units across England and Wales have either already closed  or are under threat of being closed or downgraded. The number of 999 calls has also risen by more than ten per cent in a year for most ambulance trusts across the country. Adrian Gilbert, Acting General Secretary for the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, said: ‘Ambulance staff are run ragged on shifts and it’s no wonder the number of staff off for stress has increased. ‘They are coming in to do  a 12-hour shift and instead it has gone on for 14 hours. You have got hospitals closing A&Es across the country and this means ambulances are having to go farther afield. ‘So instead of a five-mile journey to the nearest hospital, it can sometimes  be a 25-mile journey. Threat: There are growing concerns that closures and increasing numbers of calls are having an affect on drivers, as research shows that 33 casualty units across England and Wales have either already closed or are under threat . ‘If there are three or four vehicles out of the area, it means the ambulance crews who are still in the area are being run ragged.’ The new figures come after a Freedom of Information request to England’s  12 ambulance trusts. Last week Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham revealed ambulances were being forced to wait with patients outside A&E for more than five hours – because of congestion inside.","The figures from 2011-12 contrast with 31,268 days off in 2009-10 .

Google is being sued by dozens of customers in Britain who claim it secretly monitored their computers and phones. More than 100 Apple product users are seeking compensation in a lawsuit over claims the internet giant tampered with security software in order to access their personal information. Some claimants said they felt as if they were being ‘stalked’ after they were bombarded by phone calls and emails advertising clothes, magazines and bank loans connected to the websites they had visited on their iPhones, iPads and laptops. Compensation claims: Google is being sued by customers who claim it secretly monitored their computers and phones . Campaigners say up to ten million people may have fallen victim – and believe the lawsuit against the search engine could become one of the biggest in British legal history. One claimant, Marc Bradshaw, said he checked instructions on Google’s website to stop it collecting data from his iPhone. ‘Then it emerged Google had worked around the privacy setting,’ Mr Bradshaw, an IT expert, said. ‘They tried to argue it was a programming error. But this was not an accident.’ Google has previously offered guarantees it would not collect data from those using the Apple internet browser, Safari. But the company harvested details of websites users had visited so they could bombard them with ads, it is alleged. Stalked: Some claimants said they were bombarded by phone calls and emails advertising clothes, magazines and bank loans connected to websites they had visited on their iPhones, iPads and laptops . The case is the latest in a string of concerns over the secretive company, which made £2.6billion in the UK in 2012. It emerged that Google had harvested data from millions of homes with its Street View cars, which were photographing virtually every road in Britain. The data included passwords and bank details. The company has also been condemned as ‘immoral’ for slashing more than £200million from its UK tax bill in 2011 by pushing revenues offshore. It is thought that the latest problem may have affected anyone using an Apple computer or an iPhone or iPad to surf between September 2011 and February last year, as well as anyone who has downloaded and used the Safari browser in that time. Privacy campaigner Alex Hanff said the case has ‘the potential to become the largest ever group action seen in the UK’. A similar case brought against Google in America last year resulted in it being fined £14.5million and reprimanded by the US Federal Trade Commission. The law firm handling the case, Olswang said it had been ‘inundated’ with requests to join the action. ‘The biggest thing we want is an explanation from Google,’ said partner Dan Tench. He said the version of Safari launched in 2011 blocked ‘cookies’ – the name for devices that track the use of internet pages. ‘Google had a bit of code put in which subverted that protection. Users had what lawyers call a reasonable expectation of privacy.’ Google makes more than 95 per cent of its money from selling advertising space at the side of its own search results. Companies can pay a premium to have their adverts targeted at those who are more likely to be interested in their products. Google holds data on people’s past web activity, from which it can infer a vast amount of personal information, including interests and disposable income. This results in users being bombarded with adverts on the back of previous web activity. Google refused to comment.","More than 100 Apple product users are seeking compensation in a lawsuit .

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 20:26 EST, 2 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:12 EST, 3 February 2013 . The brother of EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie confessed to killing her in a letter to their father - but insisted he was 'not evil'. Tony McCluskie, 36, lied that he could not remember battering his sister to death at their east London home, butchering her body and dumping the parts in a nearby canal. In a letter he sent to his father Anthony from Highdown Prison in Surrey, the murderer wrote that he 'wouldn't hurt a fly' and 'would do anything for the family'. Horrific: Gemma McCluskie was bludgeoned to death and chopped into pieces by her sick brother Tony . Tony McCluskie told his father Anthony he was sorry for his actions - but could not remember the murder . But Anthony and Ms McCluskie's other brother, Danny, said they could never forgive him for what he did. They also revealed that innocent Danny and his best friend were questioned over the sick crime. McCluskie killed his sister on March 1 last year after an argument over his cannabis use at their house in Shoreditch. He then chopped up her body with knives and a meat cleaver, packed it in a suitcase and threw it into Regent's Canal. The 36-year-old then lied to the police about what had happened, joining in the search for the 29-year-old along with friends, family and stars including Martine McCutcheon. But his letter to his 61-year-old father, seen by The Sun, contains an admission of guilt - although McCluskie maintains he cannot remember what had happened. Until then, the killer had lied to everyone and even denied being the murderer to Anthony's face with his father visited him in jail before the trial. Twisted: McCluskie helped with the search for his sister before police began finding her body parts . He came clean a day after sending the confession letter, Anthony revealed. The letter reads: 'Dad you know me well enough to know that I'm not an evil person and it wasn't me that done such a terrible thing. 'It chokes me up knowing I did. I wish I could tell you more and I sit here day and night thinking non-stop, but I just can't remember what happened that day. 'I've always been the quiet one, the one that wouldn't hurt a fly, the one that would do anything for our family. I just hope you can forgive me.' McCluskie adds that he is broken-hearted to have hurt people and cannot believe what he has done, before signing off with six kisses. But a grieving Anthony said his son's actions had been disgusting and that he deserved to be in jail. He said his daughter had told him that McCluskie was becoming violent in the months before the murder. On one occasion, he put his hands around her neck and on another, he slapped her around the face. She had said he was getting out of control and taking too many drugs. Anthony said he tortures himself by vividly imagining what happened that day and does not think his son will ever tell him the truth. Disturbed: McCluskie had attacked his sister at least twice before. Pictured, her north London funeral . While he will not abandon his son, he added, he will never forgive him. Brother Danny said he never wanted to see his sibling again, and had also been lied to by his brother on the one occasion he visited the prison. He said he watched the CCTV footage of McCluskie dragging the suitcase full of body parts towards the canal ten times. Danny relived telling their mother Pauline about Ms McCluskie's death while she was in hospital after having a benign brain tumour removed. He said a single tear ran down her face and she repeatedly mouthed the word 'no', unable to speak because of the operation. At doctors' advice, the family only told her the shocking truth about McCluskie's involvement months later. Sentencing McCluskie to a minimum of 20 years behind bars at the Old Bailey on Wednesday, Mr Justice Fulford told McCluskie he was responsible for an ‘utterly cold-blooded and determined’ killing. He said the window cleaner was driven to kill by his addiction and resentment over living with his ‘hugely popular and outgoing’ sister. Troubled: The judge said McCluskie resented his outgoing sister, pictured in EastEnders with Dean Gaffney . The judge said the crime was ‘extremely grave’ and made worse by McCluskie’s attempts to conceal her body and point the finger of blame at others. The actress, who worked part-time as a barmaid, enjoyed success as Kerry Skinner in the BBC soap in 2000, at the age of 17. In contrast, her brother drifted between manual jobs, most recently as a window cleaner on high-rise buildings. McCluskie spent most of the time in his room, smoking up to 15 cannabis joints and drinking up to ten pints of lager, fortified with shots of tequila, every day. Gemma was killed after returning from the opening of the new Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. Earlier in the day friends heard her ringing McCluskie to tell him she was sick of his cannabis habit and he would have to move out. When she arrived in the afternoon of March 1 last year, she discovered he had left the bathroom taps running and flooded the bathroom. Neighbours heard her sobbing before McCluskie repeatedly shouted: ‘I’m sorry Gemma, I must have been out of my mind.’ For four days he acted as the concerned brother, even posing for photographs with an appeal poster. And in a chilling ruse, McCluskie texted his sister, pretending he did not know she was dead. He signed off one message with ‘love ya xxx’. Police analysed his messages and discovered it was the only  time he had ever told his sister he loved her. Carol McCluskie, Gemma's stepmother and Anthony's wife, said: 'I have watched my husband slowly become a broken man. 'There has always been laughter in our house but now it is very rare.

Two days before President Barack Obama's first trip outside Washington to promote his gun-control proposals, the White House tried on Saturday to settle a brewing mystery by releasing a photo to back his claim to be a skeet shooter. Obama had set inquiring minds spinning when, in an interview with The New Republic magazine, he answered ‘yes’ when asked if he had ever fired a gun. The admission came as a surprise to many. ‘Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,’ Obama said in the interview released last weekend, referring to the official presidential retreat in rural Maryland, which he last visited in October while campaigning for re-election. Guns a blazing: The White House released this picture, taken on Aug. 4, of the president skeet shooting after skeptics questioned Mr Obama's claim that he enjoyed shooting at Camp David . Former White House senior adviser David Plouffe took to Twitter to mock those who might claim the photograph of President Obama shooting a firearm is fake . White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer joined in the teasing by posting the Obama pic from his official Twitter account . George W. Bush looks to the sky during a dove hunt in Hockley, Texas in 2004 . Asked whether the entire family participates, the president said: ‘Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.’ Then on Saturday morning, the White House released the photo of Obama . shooting at clay pigeons at the presidential retreat at Camp David in . Maryland. Former White House senior adviser David Plouffe couldn't resist mocking those who might claim the photograph of President . Obama shooting was fake and tweeted: 'Attention skeet birthers. Make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin!' White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer also joined in the teasing and tweeted the picture of the President with a shout-out to the 'skeeters' - namely people who might claim the image is false. Both men received a large amount of online abuse for their attempts at humor. The image of a U.S. president holding a gun is certainly nothing new. A number of men who have held the highest office in America have been pictured holding guns, from Theodore Roosevelt to George W. Bush. President Bill Clinton holds a Colt AR-15 rifle during a ceremony at the White House in 1994, where he launched efforts to pass the assault weapons ban . President George H. Bush displays a rifle given to him as a gift, in Billings, Mont. in 1992 . The shooting range at Camp David was installed by President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. The retired Army general enjoyed shooting and even brought visiting dignitaries, including Prince Charles, to join him. Presidents . John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush are among the former . U.S. leaders who have also been photographed packing heat. Mr Obama's predecessor, 43rd . President George W.

The image of President Obama shooting at clay targets was released at a time when he is pushing a package of gun-control measures in response to the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. The National Rifle Association, which has rejected Obama's proposals, scoffed at the photo. ‘One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,’ said Andrew Arulanandam, the organization's spokesman.

Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines . and says requiring background checks for all gun purchases would be . ineffective because the administration isn't doing enough to enforce . existing gun laws. Asked . at Monday's press briefing how frequently Obama shoots skeet and . whether photos existed, White House press secretary Jay Carney said he . didn't know how often. Pictures may exist, he said, but he hadn't seen . any. ‘Why haven't we heard about it before?’ Carney was asked. ‘Because . when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and . friends and relax, not to produce photographs,’ Carney said. Obama is accompanied almost everywhere by at least one White House photographer. Carney declined to comment on the decision to release the photo, which he had announced on Twitter. The . release appeared to be part of a strategy to portray Obama as . sympathetic to gun owners and opponents of his gun-control measures who . argue the proposals would infringe on an individual's Second Amendment . right to bear arms. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Allied invasion chief, fires a Browning light machine gun using his hip as a mount, during an inspection of an infantry unit in England in 1944 . President Calvin Coolidge shoots at clay pigeons at his vacation home on the Brule at Superior, Wis, in 1928 . A top official with the National Skeet Shooting Association said the photo suggests Obama is a novice shooter. ‘This . isn't something he's done very often because of how he's standing, how . he has the gun mounted,’ said Michael Hampton, executive director of the . San Antonio-based association. Hampton . said Obama's remark about ‘skeet shooting all the time’ and the White . House photo would have met less skepticism had the president spoken . about his hobby months before this new debate over guns in the U.S. ‘Once it becomes controversial and there's problems, to talk about it then, that's where it becomes very debatable and is not being received as well as if he would have done this six months ago,’ Hampton said. In interview, appearing in The New Republic's Feb. 11 issue, Obama said gun-control advocates should be better listeners in the debate over firearms, which was sparked by the December killing of elementary school pupils in Connecticut. He also declared his deep respect for the long tradition of hunting in this country. ‘I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake,’ Obama said. President Theodore Roosevelt, posing as an 'outdoorsman' points his rifle during a studio photo session, date unknown . ‘Part of being able to move this forward . is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different . from the realities of guns in rural areas. And if you grew up and your . dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and . spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your . family's traditions, you can see why you'd be pretty protective of . that.’ 'So it's trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months. And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes,' Obama said. His gun control measures also have met resistance on Capitol Hill. In Minneapolis on Monday, Obama plans to make remarks and discuss his proposals with local and law enforcement officials during a stop at the police department's special operations center. He's also expected to hear from community members about their experiences with gun violence. Obama announced his proposals in mid-January, about a month after the Dec. 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.","The White House has released a picture of President Obama shooting at the Camp David range .

Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith said flooding is getting worse because of a 'new kind of rain' Britain's worsening floods are caused by a 'new kind of rain', according to the head of the Environment Agency. Chairman Lord Smith says changes in rain patterns mean parts of the country are being hit by prolonged downpours that are causing extreme flooding. Thousands of homes and businesses were damaged and at least eight people were killed in 2012 as Britain suffered its second wettest year on record. Lord Smith told the Sunday Telegraph that changes in the way it rains have contributed to the severe floods, in a claim reminiscent of British Rail's 'wrong type of snow excuse'. He said: 'Instead of rain sweeping across the country, we are getting convective rain, which sits in one place and just dumps itself in a deluge over a long period of time. ‘From the point of view of filling up the rivers and the drains, that it is quite severe.’ Groundwater remains too high across Britain and further heavy rain could see more flooding. However, the record-breaking rain of the past 12 months means there is no chance of a drought in 2013. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'If there was not another drop of rain for the whole of the rest of this year we would survive, but we would be seriously worried.' He said warnings of more extreme weather in the future means there is a 'constant' need to improve defences. Former culture secretary Lord Smith was speaking 60 years after the Great Floods, which killed 307 people along the east coast. Coastal towns and villages in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent and Lincolnshire were severely hit by the North Sea storms. In Canvey Island, Essex, alone about 13,000 people had to be evacuated and 59 people were killed. Heavy floods hit many parts of the UK last year, such as Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, pictured, as the country suffered its second wettest year in history . Lord Smith said the country needs to be vigilant about flooding and defences must be upgraded in parts . Lord Smith said flood defences have improved dramatically since then and stand two metres higher  than they did in 1953. However, he said with the country facing rising sea levels over the next 50 years, defences need constantly upgrading. Despite these warnings the Environment Agency has seen a 27 per cent funding cut since the Coalition came to power in 2010. Although, Lord Smith said the severe weather of 2012 has pushed floods higher up the list of Government priorities.","Lord Smith said patterns in Britain have changed to 'convective' rain .

A 14-month-old baby who cannot cry because of a baffling condition will soon be allowed home after spending her whole life until now in hospital. Maddison Gill, of Trull, Somerset, is unable to suck, swallow, gag or cough and doctors believe that she could be the only person in the world with the bizarre complaint. The condition means Madisson, who has spent her life at Musgrove Hospital, in Taunton, Somerset, needs to be regularly fed and given medication through a tube and has to be watched at all times. Going home: Maddison Gill, 14 months, is pictured with her parents Tamsin Whateley, 21, and Gene Gill, 23 . But now doctors are preparing to let Maddison move home after they agreed to implement a rigorous care routine from her own bedroom. Mother Tamsin Whately, 21, said she was ‘really excited’ to know that her daughter was finally coming home and could not believe that she would be able to use the bedroom meant for her. ‘It is the weirdest feeling in the world knowing that she will be in the bedroom next door now,’ she added. 'It is nice to have her in the bedroom that was meant for her. I'm so proud of her.’ Doctors first realised something was wrong with Maddison, who was born in October 2011, when she began to gurgle instead of cry when she was born. Leaving hospital: Doctors are preparing to let Maddison move home after they agreed to implement a rigorous care routine from her own bedroom, which has left her mother Tamsin Whately delighted . But it was only when they gave the tiny tot her first bottle and she turned blue and needed resuscitating that they grasped the seriousness of the situation. 'It is nice to have her in the bedroom that was meant for her. I'm so proud of her' Tamsin Whately . Maddison then spent eight weeks on a neonatal unit while doctors tried to work out her bizarre condition. Miss Whately and her partner Gene Gill, 23, were able to bring their daughter home in December 2011 but returned only two days later after she began turning grey. They have been unable to leave the hospital ever since. Cute: Maddison needs to be regularly fed and given medication through a tube and watched at all times . She has since undergone numerous operations, including a tracheostomy and a gastrostomy to assist her breathing and eating, but doctors are still unable to diagnose her condition. 'She looks completely normal and does copy some things like screwing up her face to smile and blowing bubbles, but she can't cry or swallow' Tamsin Whately . Miss Whately, a former nursery nurse, said: ‘She has an undiagnosed neuromuscular condition. Essentially she doesn't have reflexes. ‘She looks completely normal and does copy some things like screwing up her face to smile and blowing bubbles, but she can't cry or swallow or anything like that. ‘When she cries she is not using the muscles to make a facial expression, she uses others, so she just sort of screws her face up and whimpers. Mystery: Maddison has undergone numerous operations, including a tracheostomy and a gastrostomy to assist her breathing and eating, but doctors are still unable to diagnose her condition . ‘In July she had a tracheostomy to help her breathe and she has picked up a lot since that operation. She has learned to roll now and she won't stop until she hits an object - she loves it. 'She has learned to roll now and she won't stop until she hits an object - she loves it' Tamsin Whately . ‘She has also learned to hold her weight and stand on her legs now too which she couldn't do before, and she does what I call commando shuffling where she uses her elbows and her knees. ‘She has surprised absolutely everybody. We have had the same developmental physiotherapist since she was born and she said to me the other day that when Maddison was born she thought she would not be able to do anything at all.’ The family will now meet with doctors at the hospital next week for a discharge meeting in a hope to bring Maddison home before the end of this month. Mother and child: Tamsin Whately said she was 'really excited' to know that her daughter was finally coming home and could not believe that she would be able to use the bedroom meant for her . Once home Maddison will need 24-hour care and nurses will watch the tot as she sleeps to ensure nothing goes wrong. 'It is hard for us because as much as we want to we can't watch her during the day time and during the night time, we need sleep too' Tamsin Whately . ‘The care workers have said they will come in to watch her five days a week so my mum has moved in with us and has volunteered to do the other two days which is amazing’, Miss Whately added. ‘It is hard for us because as much as we want to we can't watch her during the day time and during the night time, we need sleep too. ‘We did have her home briefly for two weeks a few months back in preparation, that was an incredible feeling. ‘It was so strange getting out of bed and knowing Maddison was only next door and that we didn't need to get dressed and go out to the hospital and visit her.

Bulgarian and Romanian workers will go to other European countries when an immigration ban is relaxed at the beginning of next year, leading politicians from the two countries said today. Bulgarian foreign minister Nikolay Mladenov said many of his compatriots would much rather travel to Germany, Spain and Italy, as his country has stronger business links with those countries. He said there was a danger that fears about thousands of immigrants descending on the UK could 'dampen' relations with Bulgaria. Migration: Bulgarian nationals queuing up outside the British Embassy in Sofia for visa applications in 2006 . Romanian ambassador to the UK, Dr Ion Jinga, said many immigrants had already by-passed the restrictions by declaring themselves self-employed and finding jobs in sectors such as construction. The two men were interviewed by Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News amid fears that when the ban preventing immigrants from the two countries working in the UK comes to an end at the beginning of next year, thousands will arrive and look for jobs. Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union in 2007 but under 'transitional arrangements' workers from the two countries were prevented from travelling to the UK. Mr Mladenov said the relaxing of the restrictions would not lead to a flood of immigrants coming here. He said: 'I do not expect the UK to be overwhelmed by a wave of our nationals coming over seeking employment for a number of reasons. 'When we look at the experience of other countries over the last seven years, this has not happened and there is no reason to believe that this would happen in the UK in the January of next year. Bulgarian foreign minister Nikolay Mladenov said many of his compatriots would much rather travel to Germany, Spain and Italy . 'We have not seen since Bulgaria's accession to the European Union mass waves of Bulgarians moving across Europe and seeking illegal rights or illegal immigration to other countries. 'We had some issues in the first days after accession but in a number of cases we acted very swiftly and they were addressed, and so there were no lasting concerns. 'The UK would not be the primary . country of choice for many people to go and work. Our economy is mostly . connected to the German economy. 'We . have a large number of companies working in places like Spain and . Italy, where we have long-standing traditions and where the labour . market had opened to Bulgarians quite some time ago. 'I really don't believe that there is a need to have these fearful debates that are happening. 'On . the contrary, I think people in the United Kingdom, given your history, . must understand that immigration has always been beneficial to your . economy, just as Britain's membership of the European Union has been . beneficial to not only jobs creation but prosperity in your country.' Meanwhile a diplomatic row has broken out after Britain made public last week plans to warn off Romanian migrants. It emerged the government is considering launching a campaign in Romania and Bulgaria to put people off coming to the UK. The ban preventing immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria working in the UK comes to an end at the beginning of next year. It is thought thousands will arrive looking for jobs . But the Romanian foreign minister has said restrictions on its citizens to work in the UK has caused 'serious concern.' Dr Jinga said fears that many Romanians would come to the UK was a 'false problem'. He said: 'Romanians' immigration pattern is not towards the UK but towards Spain, Italy and France, for instance because of the language proximity, Romanian being a Latin language. 'We have one million Romanians already living and working in Spain, one million in Italy, probably half a million in France."" He added: 'Those Romanians who have wanted to come to Britain, they have already done it.'There are some restrictions for some areas of activities but no visa requirements, so those who have wanted to come, they have done it. 'It is always a possibility to find a job, even if it is under restrictions, and that solution is to declare yourself self-employed, and many Romanians have done so. 'For instance in the construction sector, there are many Romanians here and that is why your Olympic village was built up last year.' New data shows the proportion of people across who say English is not their main language  ranging from 0.7 per cent in Redcar and Cleveland to 41.4 per cent in Newham in London. The breakdown from the 2011 national census also revealed the second most commonly  spoken language in the country is now Polish. Polish was virtually unheard on the streets of Britain a decade ago but its use has soared since the country joined the EU in May 2004. The census figures show that other Eastern European languages are  now in the list of the most popular, including Lithuanian, spoken by 85,000 people, and Latvian, first  language of 32,000. Romanian and Bulgarian are other languages that can be heard – a year before citizens of Romania and  Bulgaria are allowed access to the UK  in the same way they have been to Poles since 2004. Romanian is the first language of 68,000 people in England and Wales, and Bulgarian of 38,000 people.","Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union in 2007 but workers were prevented from travelling to the UK .

Speaking to The Sunday Times he described how before he went up to bed that evening, his wife Sabah, 44, who was also a doctor, had asked him to check everything was safe and secure. But at 1.40am the couple were woken up with a loud bang and the house was quickly filling up with smoke. Realising the ferocity of the fire, Shakoor knew he had to get help quick and after fumbling to find his glasses and phone he bravely jumped out of the front window and landed on a car parked below. A neighbour tried to get into the house but turned back because there was too much smoke, he said. But the doctor knew he had to do something and made one last desperate attempt to get back inside the house to save his family. But it was too late. As he fought his way up the stairs he called out the names of his beloved family members, one by one. But no one answered. 'Every second seemed like a hundred thousand hours,' he said. All six victims died of asphyxiation through smoke inhalation. His wife Sabah died at the scene with their 12-year-old daughter Hira and sons Muneeb, 9, and Rayyan, 6. Sohaib, 11, died at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow where Dr Shakoor worked.

A new video-sharing service on Twitter has been inundated with pornographic footage. One hardcore clip appeared as the editor’s pick at the top of the home page of Vine. Word spread and the footage soon received a ‘popular now’ ranking. The risque video was posted by a user called NSFWVine – a seeming reference to the ‘not safe for work’ warning some users deploy when posting rude content. It is just one of the hundreds of short porn videos which have appeared on the site since it launched last Thursday. The social networking service apologised for what it said had been a mistake with the editor’s pick but refused to automatically take down explicit clips – saying that would be censorship. One Twitter user, Taylor Winkelmeyer, said: ‘I clicked on the link because I thought the warning was a joke. I am furious I had to see something like this. Someone please tell me how to get it off my feed.’ Twitter blamed human error and said the video has been removed. But the site still does not automatically take down explicit material – saying sexual content is not specifically banned. Apple takes a different stance and its App Store has removed providers containing pornographic material. Twitter’s Vine service is designed to encourage members to share clips recorded on their smartphones. It extends the 140-character ethos of Twitter – which has 10million UK users, a sixth of the population – to video, with clips limited to six seconds. But the ease and lack of restrictions allows users to spread porn quickly. There are fears that even anti-porn filters may not be able to block adult videos on sites such as Vine. There is also concern that teenagers will use Vine to film erotic scenes and distribute them to friends. The Daily Mail has been highlighting the dangers to children as part of its Block Online Porn campaign.

Police in South Florida say Victoria Flores Zavala, 36, was watching TV in her home around 1.50am this morning when she horrifyingly discovered her estranged husband, Isidro Zavala, choking one of her young boys with a rope. The mother tried to fight off the man who no longer lived in the Boynton Beach home and begged him to kill her and spare their two boys aged 11 and 12 instead, police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater said. Murder: A body is removed from this house in Boynton Beach, Florida where a father is believed to have slayed his two young boys before taking his own life . ‘He told her she was going to stay alive and suffer the loss of them,’ Slater said. Police identified the children as 12-year-old Eduardo Zavala and 11-year-old Mario Zavala. One boy was found dead in a screened patio area, and the other was in the kitchen. Police say both were strangled with rope while the youngest, Mario, was shot several times before the father turned the gun on himself in the kitchen. They say Isidro, who was found dressed in all black, went to the house with the intention of killing both his sons as well as his estranged wife. Suffering: The mother told police that she begged her estranged husband to kill her and spare their two boys aged 11 and 12, but he wanted her to live and suffer their deaths . The couple also has a 19-year-old son, who does not live at the home and was not at the scene at the time. Police say his father left him an emotional note inside a blue bag left at the scene. In addition to the note dated January 31, they found a second Tec9 automatic firearm, extra ammunition, duct tape and cutting shears inside that bag, the Sun Sentinel reports.

Theresa May has decided to run for the Tory leadership when David Cameron quits, with allies touting her as Britain’s answer to Angela Merkel. Backers of the Home Secretary, including some of the most senior women in the Conservative Party, have begun quietly gathering support for her candidacy. They argue she is the best Cabinet candidate to take on Boris Johnson and unite the party. Friends say Mrs May is attending ‘a lot’ of constituency dinners where she can curry favour with both MPs and the grassroots. ‘She has decided that she rather wants the job,’ said one supporter. ‘Theresa is tough as nails. She has quietly got on with a job that is usually a political graveyard. ‘She’s not showy but she has good judgment. She’s not the new Maggie, she’s more like Angela Merkel.’ Details of the planning emerged as David Cameron was bounced into guaranteeing George Osborne’s job as Chancellor. The Mail revealed yesterday that some Tory MPs are plotting to force him out. Rebels plotting a coup that would supposedly have seen backbencher Adam Afriyie replace Mr Cameron have now turned their guns on the Chancellor and will demand his head later this year if the UK slips into a triple-dip recession. But a senior government source, on Mr Cameron’s trip to Liberia, said the PM had privately guaranteed Mr Osborne his job until the next election. ‘George Osborne will be Chancellor at the next election,’ the source said. ‘He’s an extremely successful Chancellor battling very difficult economic circumstances. ‘He has the Prime Minister’s full confidence. I can’t think of a single Conservative who has raised doubts about George with the Prime Minister.’ Allies of Mrs May believe that, with Mr Osborne under fire, she has a good chance of emerging as the best choice to replace Mr Cameron when he eventually quits. ‘George will only run if he thinks he can win,’ said one Tory. ‘Right now it doesn’t look like he can.’ Mrs May is also winning the support of those seeking an ‘Anyone But Boris’ candidate as successor to the Prime Minister. One minister said: ‘The public might like Boris but they don’t know him. A lot of us worked really hard to get him re-elected as Mayor and then he repays us by undermining the Prime Minister on the economy and Europe. He’s a treacherous b******’. He added: ‘The question is who can stop him and that’s why Theresa’s name is coming up.’ Mrs May sparked speculation about her future when she gave a highly personal interview about her sadness at not having children. Support grew among MPs as she pushed through reforms of the police despite vilification by senior officers. Backing: David Cameron has been forced to issue a guarantee that George Osborne's job as Chancellor . She pleased right-wingers by taking a tough line on opting out of European home affairs directives and standing up to the US by refusing to deport computer hacker Gary McKinnon. Her longstanding view that the party needs to modernise has endeared her to many on the left. Senior female MPs, including ousted Cabinet Ministers Cheryl Gillan and Caroline Spelman are quietly letting it be known that they will support her. Those who have seen her in Cabinet say she stands her ground with the Prime Minister and Chancellor. One Cabinet minister said: ‘She doesn’t take any s*** from David and George. She defends her corner like a tiger.’ Mrs May’s position has been strengthened by Michael Gove’s emphatic claims that he will not run. A senior government source insisted speculation about Mr Cameron’s future was having no impact on him. He said: ‘He feels he had got very strong support from colleagues in Parliament.’","Allies see her as Britain's answer to Angela Merkel and best Cabinet candidate to take on Boris Johnson .

A brave 11-year-old girl single-handedly sailed a 24ft yacht back to shore after her father collapsed and blacked out on board. Unity Bowns was sailing with father Matthew, 58, when he fell ill with gallstone pancreatitis. But the quick-thinking girl took control and sailed the boat five miles to meet her mother, Rachel, who was waiting at the pontoon in Emsworth, Hants. Brave: Unity Bowns, 11, was sailing with her father Matthew, 58, before he fell ill with gallstone pancreatitis - but she managed to steer the boat five miles through congested waters to reach the pontoon in Emsworth, Hants . Unity, a year 7 pupil at Portsmouth High School, said: 'It was a bit scary knowing that daddy might be in trouble. 'I wasn't really sure what to do so I phoned mummy but it did feel a bit like I was on my own. 'I sort of knew what I was meant to be doing because daddy had told me a lot about this sort of thing - but I never thought I'd experience it first hand. 'I was thinking of getting daddy in safely but there were two parts to that - making sure he was still okay while he was down below crouched over - and to get the boat back. 'It was quite easy until it came to mooring up, it was tricky doing it on my own. I think daddy is quite proud of me."" Unity's father phoned earlier that morning to say he felt unwell after staying overnight aboard the Achilles 24 with his daughter. And when he collapsed she reacted quickly, using the outboard motor to power back to Emsworth, despite hardly being able to see from her place at the helm. Good job skipper: Unity had to tackle the busy five-mile route between Emsworth Pontoon on the mainland and Mill Rythe on Hayling Island . Safe: Unity back on dry land after the ordeal. She has been honoured by the Royal Yacht Association for her courage . Now The Royal Yacht Association has rewarded Unity for her 'courage and fortitude in an emergency'. It was the first time Unity, who has been sailing since she was four, had solo skippered a boat that big. She had to navigate past a number of vessels as she moved from their anchored position at Mill Rythe on Hayling Island, Hants. When they made it back to the pontoon, a member of Emsworth Sailing Club rushed Matthew to hospital. Her mother, Rachel, said she was initially concerned Unity might not be able to handle the boat. The 47-year-old said: 'Unity's very practical and very down to earth - she just got on with it. 'I was very proud of her and so was her dad. He was there and conscious, so he was able to advise her if she needed it but in fact she didn't.'","Unity Brown negotiated congested waters near Hayling Island, Hants .

Moors Murderer Ian Brady's desperate wish to die moved closer today after he signed a legally-binding document demanding he must not be resuscitated should he fall gravely ill. The killer has tried to starve himself to death for 13 years and has now started the process to block any doctors helping him if he is close to death. In a shocking twist, if his demand is agreed but medical staff keep him alive, he could sue for damages and receive a taxpayer-funded payout. Brady, who was 75 on January 2, is trying to hand Power of Attorney to his mental health advocate Jackie Powell, 49, who would then enforce his death wish. Killer: Ian Brady has started a legal process to give Power of Attorney to his mental health advocate Jackie Powell (right) and force doctors to let him die should he be gravely ill . 'In no circumstances does he want drugs or any treatment including oxygen or resuscitation,' she told The Sun. 'In effect, Ian Brady has signed a living will. If he is unconscious and I am approached as his Lasting Power of Attorney, my instructions are that he must be allowed to die. 'If they were to ignore his wishes he could sue them'. Last July Brady was furious after he collapsed and stopped breathing following a seizure but doctors resuscitated him. The 75-year-old suffers from a degenerative spine condition and fractured two . vertebrae in the fall. He was transferred from Ashworth Hospital to the University . Hospital Aintree, six miles away. Brady spent two nights in a private . room before being driven back to Ashworth. He has been held at the secure hospital – at an estimated cost of £7.3million – since 1985.

Grief: Keith Bennett's mother Winnie Johnson, pictured on Saddleworth . Moor above Oldham, died in August, having never been able to lay her son . to rest . The Office of the Public Guardian will now consider his application, a process which will take six weeks.

His confidante Jackie Powell was arrested last summer on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body after becoming embroiled in controversy following her participation in a Channel 4 documentary, Endgames Of A Psychopath. On camera, Miss Powell said Brady had given her a sealed envelope to be opened after his death, which would ‘allow [Keith’s mother] Winnie Johnson to find peace’. She speculated that the contents might reveal the location of 12-year-old Keith’s body on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham.

"By . Antonia Hoyle . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 2 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:17 EST, 2 February 2013 . As a maternity nurse to the stars, Rachel Waddilove has cared for countless celebrity babies, with actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Minnie Driver among her clients. Paltrow credits Waddilove with helping her daughter Apple sleep through the night at just six weeks old. Driver, who is a single mother, praised her extraordinary ‘calmness and knowledge’. And now Waddilove, who charges £280 for a 24-hour home visit, has written a book to teach those of us not blessed with an  A-list budget how to get a child to sleep. Magic touch: Supernanny to the stars, Rachel Waddilove helps Antonia Hoyle find the best way of putting her 5-week-old son Felix to bed at night . It was a pressing issue for me last month: my son Felix was three weeks old and I hadn’t had more than two hours of uninterrupted sleep since his arrival. Coupled with the exertions of caring  for my boisterous two-year-old daughter Rosie, tiredness was transforming me into a wreck. So I was eager to meet Waddilove and road-test her methods. Could she turn my unsettled newborn into a sleeping-through-the-night miracle? Waddilove’s advice is based on the way she brought up her three children in the Seventies. She believes babies today are given the status of ‘King Pin’, with their mother’s wellbeing often neglected. She suggests three-hour feeding routines, leaving your baby to cry, introducing a bottle, and even putting the baby in a separate room overnight. ‘Mothers are fed too much worry nowadays. I’m strict about them getting rest,’ says Waddilove, 65, now a grandmother of five who lives with her husband John, 75, a retired farmer, in Devon. Unsurprisingly, those who advocate the increasingly popular ‘attachment’ style of parenting – in which babies feed and sleep whenever they choose, often sleeping in the same bed as the mother – question her Victorian-sounding methods. Best supporting role: Minnie Driver hired Rachel Waddilove to help with baby Henry . So where does her approach come from? Waddilove’s own mother employed a maternity nurse to put Rachel and her five siblings on a strict routine as babies in the Forties – so this is an obvious influence. In 1964, Waddilove trained as a maternity nurse at a Barnardo’s children’s home, where following a routine was the only way of looking after the hundreds of babies in her care. ‘It was just the way things were done,’ she says. In the following decade, there was a backlash in parenting methods and Waddilove found herself in the minority. ‘My friends were feeding their babies on demand and they were all over the place,’ she says. Most of my friends with babies favour . attachment parenting. But I found myself agreeing with Waddilove’s . methods. I was put on a routine as a baby and left to cry on occasion, . and I don’t think it has done me any harm. After following her book for a couple . of weeks, I was lucky enough to be granted  a visit from the woman . herself. Within moments of arriving at my home, she had Rosie wanting to . hold her hand and Felix fast asleep. Clearly, she has a magic touch. Napple: Gwyneth Paltrow used Rachel Waddilove to get baby Apple to sleep . The first step, Waddilove says, to get your baby to sleep is making sure they are well fed, even if that means topping up breast-feeds with the much-maligned formula. She says: ‘Anyone would think formula was poison. Babies do just as well on it.’ Waddilove said I should also be expressing milk. ‘It’s important to introduce a bottle,’ she says. ‘I do it within two weeks. It gives you flexibility and it’s good for dad to be able to feed the baby too.’ I dug out my breast pump. The more milk I pumped, the more I produced, leading to painful breasts. While Felix took to the bottle immediately, it didn’t feel fair asking my husband Chris, a financial analyst, to do overnight feeds when he had to be up at 6am. Waddilove believes leaving even the tiniest babies to cry themselves to sleep is an essential part of teaching them healthy long-term sleeping habits. She leaves tired newborns to have a ‘little shout’ for ten minutes before she picks them up, and has, on occasion, left young babies for up to half an hour. ‘I wouldn’t give a time limit because every baby is different, but don’t pick them up too soon or get into the habit of holding or suckling them to sleep,’ she says. It is easier said than done. A newborn’s scream can pierce the most hardened mother’s heart, and even if – like me –  she is prepared to leave her baby to cry, she will worry about being judged by  well-meaning friends and relatives. With Rosie, I’d pick her up almost immediately. But, bolstered by Waddilove’s words, I left Felix to cry for the first time at 1am during one particularly fractious night. With my head under the pillow, I waited for ten minutes. And he stopped. After that he had two more, shorter, crying fits until, at 1.30am, he finally gave up and went to sleep. Every minute felt interminable, and by the end I was crying too. But it worked. ‘It is incredibly upsetting,’ Waddilove acknowledges. ‘But you’re not leaving  a cold, hungry baby to scream. That’s abuse. They are fed, clean and warm.’ Waddilove believes babies should sleep and feed at about the same time every day and puts any healthy baby who weighs more than 6lb 8oz into a three-hourly routine when they are just a week old. The bigger the baby, the longer they can go between feeds. At 9lb 1oz aged three weeks, Felix could last four hours. ‘The word routine has horrible connotations but babies thrive on it,’ says Waddilove. A baby’s first feed, she says, should be at 7am. Within an hour and a half, they will be ready for a nap. Between 10am and 11am, they will feed again, before taking at least a two-hour lunchtime nap. Between 2pm and 3pm, they will have another feed, followed by another nap. After an early-evening feed at about 6pm, they will be put to bed  at 7pm. They will have a later evening feed between 10pm and 11pm and will – hopefully – sleep until the early hours. It wasn’t exactly a schedule Felix and I were running to. I had left him to sleep until after 8am and nap intermittently in the day before cuddling him all evening. Forcing myself out of bed at 7am felt unnecessary. But it helped, because I felt I was taking control. By 8am, Felix was yawning and he slept until 10.30am. But he didn’t always comply with Waddilove’s schedule. Sometimes he refused to sleep in the afternoon. The evenings were the most difficult, as Felix wouldn’t sleep for more than half an hour at a time. This is common. ‘Some people carry babies round, others leave them to holler,’ says Waddilove. ‘Some feed them on and off all evening, which is not what I would do. I would tuck the baby down, have supper, maybe rock their cot, and if they haven’t settled by 9.30pm I would do another feed.’ I persevered with her suggestion of feeding, leaving to cry, picking up after ten minutes to hug and putting back in the cot, until, when Felix was five weeks old, our evenings became less fractured. He didn’t always sleep soundly, but he usually stopped crying for long enough to let us have dinner in peace. Waddilove believes that after a month, babies should move into their own room. Even when asleep, Felix kept me awake  by grunting. I was reliant on ear plugs and my husband fled to the spare room in week one. ‘So many girls have their child in bed with them and dad sleeping in a different room,’ says Waddilove. ‘This isn’t right for family life.’ But research has shown that sleeping in the same room as your baby for their first four months reduces the risk  of cot death. ‘God forbid anything should happen but cot death is very silent. They’re not going to shout out and it won’t make any difference. When they are in a Moses basket, babies can sleep anywhere,’ Waddilove counters. ‘Put them in the bathroom.’ I put Felix in our en suite, but I lost more sleep than ever worrying that some dreadful fate should befall him, so I abandoned it after two nights. Waddilove advocates swaddling before they are put to bed until they are three months old. Certainly, the effect of swaddling on Felix was incredible. He stopped startling himself awake and seemed more content. A month on, Felix – now nearly eight weeks – is still unsettled in the evenings but usually able to get himself back to sleep after a hug. I have learned to leave him to cry without guilt. His daytime naps are gaining structure. Best of all has been his progress overnight. Those two-hour sleeps stretched to five and six hours. One night last week, to my joy and disbelief, he slept through to 7am. As for me, well, I’m still shattered, kept awake by the anxiety that comes with caring for a newborn. But I’m hoping that soon I will catch up on sleep, and the fog of new motherhood will lift.

An online video showing a blind student skateboarding near his Chicago home has made him a star and inspired thousands across the globe. The film uploaded onto video sharing website, Vimeo, three weeks ago, has been viewed almost half a million times and passed by users across the globe. It shows the remarkable ability of Tommy Carroll who was born with bi-lateral retinoblastoma or cancer of the retinas and left blind at the age of two. Inspirational: Blind skateboarder Tommy Carroll has become an internet sensation after a video about his life was uploaded to sharing site Vimeo last month . Passion: Carroll now a student at Northwestern University refused to allow his disability to keep him away from the skate park . The Northwestern University student has been skateboarding since he was 10 and uses his sense of sound to assess the movements of his board on the half pipe. 'All I do in skateboarding is based on sound. I'm constantly using the sound of my wheels to check if there's anything in my way and get my sense of direction, all that kind of stuff,' he said in the Vimeo footage of him skating near his home of Glenview. 'I think everybody should know that everything happens for a reason and there's always a way to overcome an obstacle if you really want it enough.' Carroll says he loves to go to the park early when it's quiet so he can 'use every inch' of it. He, like all other skateboarders, has been known to fall, although the dangers are obviously much greater if you can't see where you're falling. 'Falling is a skill you get good at just the same as getting good at the sport itself,' he says in the film. In an interview with McSweeney's, he says he once broke a tooth but it was because he was tired. Tough falls: Tommy Carroll, like most skateboarders, tends to fall when he's trying new tricks. In his worst fall he broke a tooth . Determination: Carroll says he just ignored those who told him a blind teenager couldn't skateboard. His ability has won him global acclaim . 'I hadn’t slept much the night before; I had gone on a trip. And my friend called me and said, “Hey, you want to go skate?” And my parents said, “No, you’re too tired, you shouldn’t go.” I was like no, I want to go. First thing I do, I drop in and I hit the side of the ramp. I just slipped and chipped my teeth.' His mother was particularly concerned about her son taking on the sport as a teenager but relented to let him explore his passion. 'My dad was pretty cool. My mom was more worried. But if I wanted to do it, she supported it,' he told the website. 'Luckily there’s been some positive media attention and scientific studies showing the adrenaline and stuff generated by [skateboarding]. It’s a good alternative to drugs and stuff like that. I feel like there’s been some positive light shed on it.' Two years ago his amazing skills on the skate park reached skateboarding legend Tony Hawk who flew to Glenview to skate with him for the day. Hero: Tommy Carroll met his hero Tony Hawk who learned of his extraordinary ability two years ago and flew to Glenview to skateboard alongside him . Inspiration: Carroll says his story shows everyone can overcome an obstacle if they really want to . The sophomore student majoring in journalism and international studies is now setting up a college skateboarding club and uses his experience to promote the use of protective gear - without which he says he would never have found the hobby. 'I think what's really fun about skateboarding is when you get something new and kind of scary - when you finally land that scary thing and you feel that tension release, that's one of the better feelings and one of the biggest adrenaline rushes you'll ever experience,' he says in the video. 'For me protective gear is the difference between being absolutely terrified while skateboarding and being completely confident. I feel that I can push myself to the next level when I am protected. I can try big tricks and not worry about getting hurt. You can be really brave when you are safe.' He says he faced doubt from some when he told them of his skateboarding ambitions but also his disability is what pushed him to master the sport. 'There were people who discouraged me. They were like, 'There’s no way. You’re going to kill yourself. Blind people can’t skateboard.' So I just ignored them',' he says on McSweeney's. 'I wanted to impress people. Definitely. I wanted to show that I could go big. I definitely always felt that pressure. Unless I was the best at a park, it was like, 'Well, you’re pretty good… for a blind kid.' I always felt pressure to try to be the very best at any given skate park because if I was only 'good' people would judge me as just being great for a blind skater. I wanted to be a great skater, period.'

An ex-van driver from Wolverhampton has been crowned the king of Elvis Presley tribute acts. Gordon Elvis' talent for impersonating his idol has taken him from Black Country karaoke bars to the spiritual home of all Presley fans - Graceland. The 28-year-old - who changed his surname by deed poll in honour of the rock and roll icon - travelled all the way to Memphis, Tennessee, where he saw off competition from 250 other acts to be named the world's best Elvis impersonator. Scroll down to watch the King of the Midlands... Career change: Gordon Elvis, 28, used to deliver beer barrels to pubs in his native Malta before he moved to the West Midlands and became a tribute artist . Judges at the contest praised Mr Elvis' authentic walk and mannerisms as well as his singing voice. 'The judges said when I walked on stage I was Elvis,' he said. 'The way I walked and moved the microphone from hand to hand and my singing.' The only thing Gordon - who is originally from Malta and now lives in Bilston - struggles to emulate is Elvis Presley's famous southern drawl. 'I am from Malta so my accent is obviously nothing like Elvis,' he said. 'And the fact that I have lived in the Black Country for four years means I have a Midlands accent as well.' The tribute artist has come a long way from delivering beer barrels to pubs back home in Malta - his occupation before he moved to the Black Country in 2008 to pursue singing full time. Gordon had been crooning Elvis songs since he was a toddler, and after wowing audiences with his renditions of the legend's famous hits at a karaoke night in Malta, he decided to move to Britain and chase his dreams. Likeness: Gordon Elvis has built up a repertoire of more than 350 Presley numbers - along with a wardrobe full of spangly jumpsuits . 'Malta is a very small place and I wanted to sing Elvis songs to a much wider audience,' he said. 'I knew the only way to do this full-time was to move to Britain. 'The work is very different in Malta - it's a small island so my act would only really be for the tourists. I did karaoke and people were encouraging me. 'A guy in a karaoke bar was saying I should impersonate Elvis for a living and I thought, why not?' Inspiration: Pictured left, Elvis Presley on stage in Las Vegas in 1973, and pictured right, Gordon Elvis on stage at Birmingham's Mackadown Club .

Mr Sierra told ABC News that her behavior is highly unusual, and that the mother to two preteen boys seemed perfectly content with her life, and going off the radar is extremely out-of-character for her. He and Mrs Sierra’s brother, David Jimenaz, are scheduled to arrive in Turkey by Monday afternoon and will continue their search aided by local officials. They said that they will also look in hospitals to see if Mrs Sierra somehow sustained an injury and was unable to make contact with them. The heartbroken husband said that he’s been married to her for more than 14 years, adding that his love for her is ‘deeper than it is for any individual.’ He told WABC: ‘You have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don’t know what to think, you don’t know what to believe, you don’t know what to expect, you don’t know what will come out of this.’ Happily married: Mrs Sierra pictured with her husband, Steven; the couple has been married for 14 years . Skyline: Mrs Sierra posted a series of pictures from Turkey on her Instagram account, including this one of Isanbul . Sunset: Mrs Sierra wrote: 'Sunset, Istanbul style' on this picture; the last picture posted was from January 20 . During her last few days in the Eurasian country, Mrs Sierra planned to head to the Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination that spans the Golden Horn waterway, to take some photographs, her mother, Betzaida Jimenez, told the Associated Press. 'You . have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don't know what to . think, . you don't know what will come out of this.' -Steven Sierra . Crime in Turkey is generally low and Istanbul is a relatively safe city for travelers, though there are areas where women would be advised to avoid going alone at night. The Galata and the nearby Galata Bridge areas have been gentrified and are home to fish restaurants, cafes and boutiques. The U.S. Consulate in Istanbul did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment over the safety of the city for Western tourists or the status of the missing mother. Sierra's children, aged 9 and 11, do not know their mother is missing, her brother said. Betzaida Jimenez said the situation has 'been a nightmare.' Man on a mission: Mr Sierra is heading over to Turkey to help local authorities search for his wife . 'I'm forcing myself to get up because I have to get up,' she said. The mother later told ABC News: 'My heart is broken,' saying that the doubt and uncertainty was causing tremendous amounts of stress on her and her family. But she said the tight-knit family was holding onto their faith. 'We're praying and trusting God that she's safe somewhere and we're going to find her,' she said. Mrs Sierra's friend, Magalena Rodriguez, told the New York Daily News that the petite woman, who stands at 5ft2in and weighs only 110 pounds, has fainted before without warning. Ms Rodriguez fears her friend has fainted and could be hurt somewhere in the unfamiliar country.

Eight people have been arrested - four on suspicion of murder - for the brutal sword and knife attack on a teenage boy in an affluent suburb of London. Hani Abou El Kheir, 16, died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico, central London on Sunday evening in a suspected drugs-related attack. Detectives, who believe at least 10 youths were involved in the incident, had already arrested a 20-year-old suspect during an early morning raid in north London on Thursday. At 6pm tomorrow, detectives investigating Hani's murder will return to the scene to appeal to people living in the area for help with their inquiries. Victim:  Detectives, who believe at least 10 youths were involved in the brutal murder of Hani Abou El Kheir (left and right) have arrested nine people in relation to the attack by a gang wielding swords and knives . Horrific: The 16-year-old died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico, one of London's most affluent neighbourhoods, last Sunday evening . Four males were arrested on suspicion of murder and one male and three females on suspicion of assisting an offender. They were being held in custody at various police stations, Scotland Yard said. The 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder and bailed until late March. The teenage victim, who lived on the nearby Churchill Gardens estate, was taken to King's College Hospital following the attack but died later. Detectives said they were keeping an 'open mind' regarding a motive and were being assisted by a number of witnesses who have already come forward. Details of the attack emerged as the inquest into Hani's death was officially opened and adjourned this week. 'This 16-year-old male was chased and assaulted by a large number of . masked and hooded youths, armed with weapons', coroners officer . Martin Urquhart told Westminster . Coroner's Court. 'He sustained serious injuries, and despite medical treatment at the . scene and at Kings College Hospital, he died later that evening.'

Tragedy: Liza Benson, 28, was killed after getting caught in an avalanche last Sunday; she died in her boyfriend's arms . A seasoned skier who was caught in an avalanche drew her last breathes in her boyfriend’s arms after the barrage of snow swept her into a tree. Elizabeth ‘Liza’ Benson was backcountry skiing with her boyfriend, Jason Ray, near Clause Peak in Wyoming last weekend when the slide drew her into the tree, causing fatal head and body trauma. Ms Benson’s death was not the only ski-related fatality – nearly 60 miles away, veteran skier and Grand Teton National Park employee Nick Gillespie died when he was caught in an avalanche at the park. Their deaths were the first people to die in slides this winter. On Sunday afternoon, Ms Benson was skiing with her boyfriend, and two other friends, including a physician. The group was skiing in the backcountry, where the powder is often fresher, but there is a significant risk of avalanches. According to the Sublette County Sheriff’s Department, the 28-year-old athlete was caught in a small slide west of Bondurant. Trapped in the snows, she hit a tree. Mr Ray, who works as a seasonal administrator for the Sublette County Search & Rescue team, rushed down to her aide. The physician was quick on the scene as well and administered CPR to Ms Benson, but realized the young woman had died in her boyfriend’s arms. Ms Benson was slated to graduate with a physician’s assistant degree, according to the Jackson Hole News and Guide. Difficult terrain: The Grand Tetons, in Jackson Hole, Wyoming test the most skilled skiers (file photo); Ms Benson was skiing on backcountry slopes . ‘I know she died happy and with someone she loved so much,’ her sister, Adrienne Benson, told the paper. ‘And it was really fast.’ Other friends and co-workers described her as passionate, with a deep love for the outdoors. She had met Mr Ray at a clinic last October, and told her sister that only after a week, she had met her soulmate. Mr Ray told the News and Guide that they were ‘doing what we loved together when tragedy struck.’ He added that the two had plans to marry. Longtime Grand Teton National Park seasonal employee Nick Gillespie, 30, of Jackson, was also caught in an avalanche around 5 p.m. Sunday on the southeast face of Survey Peak and died of injuries from the slide, park officials said Monday. Gillespie, who had worked on Grand Teton National Park's trail crew the past six seasons, was with three other people who tried to resuscitate him, park spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs said. When they were unable to, they carried his body to a backcountry patrol cabin, where they spent the night. They weren't able to make a telephone call to authorities until around 9 p.m. Sunday, so rangers weren't able to fly in to the remote area until last Monday. Fatality: Nick Gillespie, 30, of Jackson, also died in a separate avalanche last weekend; theirs were the first two avalanche deaths of this season . Park officials said the avalanche danger was listed as low last Sunday morning but was expected to rise to moderate in the afternoon between 9,000 and 10,500 feet, meaning human-triggered avalanches were possible. The avalanche danger was rated as considerable Monday at middle and high-elevations in the Tetons and moderate in the Togwotee Pass and Greys River areas. The Tetons got significant snowfall over the weekend following a prolonged dry, cold period. The snowpack is unstable because the new snow is resting on old snow that is either weak because it has crystalized and become grainy or slick because the snow melted and then turned icy, said Jim Springer of the Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center. The danger is higher on the west side of the Tetons, where up to 18 inches of snow fell Sunday.","Seasoned skier Liza Benson was going backcountry skiing with her boyfriend and two others .

With his naked indiscretions and questionable fancy dress choice, Prince Harry has cemented his reputation as the Royal Family's standalone party animal. But despite his fun-loving reputation, the prince's behaviour pales in comparison to some of his distant relatives. Surrounding themselves in the world of bohemia and frequenting London's smoke-filled jazz clubs in the early 1930s, the then Prince of Wales and his brother Prince George indulged in a life of hedonism. Antics: While Prince Harry has a reputation as a party animal, his antics are nothing compared to distant relative Prince George, right, who frequented jazz clubs in the early 1930s . Exploits: Prince George's exploits, alongside his brother the Prince of Wales, feature in a new BBC series Dancing on the Edge. Prince George is pictured here in the drama . Scandal: Director of the series, Stephen Poliakoff said that Prince George's antics in London's jazz clubs would cause 'enormous scandal' in this day and age . That is according to a BBC documentary that charts the brothers' unlikely relationship with the city's black musicians in the pre-war era. Unlike the constant media attention enjoyed by Prince Harry, which recently prompted him to express his dismay at the intrusion, the old Princes' exploits went largely unnoticed due to protective press barons. The series, Dancing on the Edge, is inspired by the siblings' scandalous exploits, with stories of affairs and drug use. The five-part series, written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, was based on diaries from the 1930s that he used for research. It hints at the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, and the Duke of Kent's questionable behaviour, which he says would prompt 'enormous scandal' in this day and age. Indulgent: The Prince of Wales, left, later Edward VIII, and his brother the Duke of Kent, right, were said to have lived an 'indulgent life' but protective press barons did not report on their behaviour . Describing Prince George's antics as much worse than anything Prince Harry would get up to, Mr Poliakoff said: 'He was much worse. There’s no . comparison. It was a very indulgent life. I don’t think anybody knew the . total truth about it, but there were stories of a series of affairs and . drugs.' While the series is largely fictional, the director said the stories told are 'absolutely historically accurate'. One . scene recalls a notorious event in which the Prince of Wales drummed . with big band legend Duke Ellington for four hours in front of a crowd. The director described the pre-war period as an 'extraordinary moment across class and race', telling the Daily Telegraph: 'The idea of Prince Charles drumming with a band and giving them nicknames would be thought extreme in our time.' Debut: Dancing on the Street will be broadcast on BBC Two at 9pm on Monday . He explained that press barons such as Lord Beaverbrook 'ensured nothing untoward about them would appear'. The series, which follows the fictional Louis Lester Band, will be broadcast on BBC Two on Monday at 9pm. The group's journey is explored against the socio-political issues of the time, as an aristocrat played by Jacqueline Bisset supports the band. Chiwetal Ejifor stars in an impressive cast featuring Caroline Quentin, John Hopkins and Hollywood star john Goodman.","Prince of Wales and his brother enjoyed hedonistic lifestyle in jazz clubs .

Struggle: Paul Gascoigne, 45, was said to have failed to answer questions during an appearance at a charity event in Northampton . Football fans expressed their fears over the health of former England star Paul Gascoigne as they watched the him burst into tears during a rambling appearance at a charity event. The 'trembling' 45-year-old had to be helped onstage for a question and answer session in which he slurred responses and muttered a slew of curse words. Guests at the event, who had paid £100 to see the footballer, described how Gascoigne apologised to the crowd, blaming 'three days on the whiskey' for his performance. The Newcastle-born footballer, widely . regarded as one of the most gifted English players, has battled . alcoholism and drug use since retiring from the game in 2004. The 500 guests described the event as having the 'atmosphere of a . funeral' as they watched Gascoigne slurring through the exchanges with . his agent Terry Baker. Gazza rose to national prominence during the Italia 90 World Cup, during which he famously broke into tears after being booked in . the semi-final against Germany. Following . the breast cancer charity event, hosted by Northampton Town, a further 15 speaking . events were cancelled - some at former clubs where Gascoigne is . regarded as a hero. Mr . Baker said that the former midfielder did not drink whisky and that the . comment had been a botched joke about being on a 'whisky diet'. He said that Gascoigne 'wasn't very well' despite having made a 'huge effort to straighten his life out' but . He told The Sun: He probably shouldn't have gone out but he didn't want to let all those people down.' Struggles: The ex-footballer has long struggled with his alcohol addiction and drug use . Failed: The event's 500 guests described the event as having the 'atmosphere of a funeral' as they watched Gascoigne slurring through the questions with his agent Terry Baker . One . attendee wrote an online account of the evening in which he described . how guests were told that Gascoigne was 'very ill' but had 'insisted on . appearing'. The fan claimed . that guests were told the former Newcastle United and Lazio star would . be brought to hospital 'immediately afterwards'. He said Mr Barker told guests that . his client had consumed two pints and that they should be 'patient' with . him, telling them to 'remember Gazza for the good times he gave us'. Once ushered onstage, Gascoigne was asked who the best player he had played with was. Fallen star: Gascoigne rose to prominence during the 1990 World . Cup, during which he famously broke into tears after being booked in . the semi-final against Germany . Career: Gascoigne has made 57 appearances for England and appeared for a number of clubs, including Everton, Tottenham and Newcastle . According to the account, he answered: 'Bryan Robson. But he's a ****. They're all ****s. You're all ****s.' After apologising, Gascoigne broke down again as he struggled to answer questions. The performance was said to have left 'a lump in everyone's throat'. Gascoigne's manager Matt Jones today said the former footballer had been 'up and down' recently. He added: 'Paul is getting the help and support that he needs. I am in regular contact with him and his counsellors and just giving him the support that he needs. 'The reality is that Paul is an alcoholic. He has been very good of late but every day is a battle not to have a drink.' Having won 57 caps for England after a glittering career in which he played for Lazio and Everton, the star tried to address his alcoholism on several occasions and has spoken about his attempts at rehabilitation.","The 45-year-old struggled to answer questions during charity appearance .

It’s one of the world’s most secretive states - and a source of intrigue for millions of outsiders. Now we have been given an insight into the inner workings of North Korea after Google published a detailed map online - showing gulag labour camps, hotels, hospitals and train networks. The map was put together by volunteer ‘citizen cartographers’ from outside the country who added road names and points of interest in the country on the Google Map Maker collaborative tool. Insight: Google published a detailed map showing gulag labour camps, hotels, hospitals and train networks . Before: This is how the secretive state of North Korea appeared on Google Maps online prior to yesterday . ‘We know this map is not perfect,' Google Map Maker’s senior product manager Jayanth Mysore said in a blog post. ‘One of the exciting things about maps is that the world is a constantly changing place. ‘While many people around the globe are fascinated with North Korea, these maps are especially important for the citizens of South Korea who have ancestral connections or still have family there.’ The country had appeared on Google Maps as an almost-completely white space until yesterday, but now it even has train stops in the capital city of Pyongyang, as well as department stores and parks. Google Maps created diagrams of once-unmapped Afghanistan and Burma with a similar method of volunteers collecting data which was fact-checked by other users, reported the Washington Post. Old and new: The country had appeared online as an almost-completely white space (left) until yesterday, but now (right0 it even has subway stops in the capital city of Pyongyang, as well as department stores . Many of them used data which was already available online, such as analogue maps and satellite images, volunteer cartographer Hwang Min-woo, 28, of Seoul, South Korea, told the newspaper. 'We know this map is not perfect. One of the exciting things about maps is that the world is a constantly changing place' Jayanth Mysore, Google Map Maker . The map gives an insight into the country’s labour camps, with the ‘Hwasong Gulag’ labelled in the North-East of the country, with a street called Gulag 16 Road cutting through the area. Two train stations called Sangryongban and Ryongdong can be seen at one end of the road, although that is all that has been recorded in the area on Google’s map. Mr Mysore added: 'Creating maps is a crucial first step towards helping people access more information about parts of the world that are unfamiliar to them.'

The map’s publication came as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said North Korea's leader has acted provocatively but she still hopes he can be convinced not to conduct a nuclear test. Mrs Clinton said the U.S. expected Kim Jong Un would allow more openness and improve the lives of North Koreans - and nations must work closely together on changing the country’s behaviour.","North Korea had been an almost-completely white space on Google Maps .

Pushed to the edge: George Bingham, son of Lord Lucan, says the rumours surrounding his father's disappearance tormented him . Lord Lucan's son has revealed how rumours surrounding his father's mysterious disappearance pushed him to the brink of a nervous breakdown. George Bingham said the gossip surrounding the case, including claims he and his sisters had travelled to Africa for secret meetings with their father, sent his life spiralling out of control. The former investment banker, 45, denies those claims and added that he hopes his revelations will help end the speculation that has caused him and his family so much pain. '[W]ith the passage of time, it has become bigger and easier to fabricate complete nonsense and create lies around it, with fewer people left alive to contradict it,' Mr Bingham told the Daily Mirror . 'Any person can get a grainy, slightly out-of-focus Polaroid from the late 70s, of a man with a moustache and say, ""That’s Lord Lucan"". I can’t prove they’re wrong.' Mr Bingham's comments today came as it emerged the BBC are planning a new documentary which is set to make previously unreported allegations about Lucan. They include a claim from a Switzerland-based driver that he drove the aristocrat across Europe on the night he went missing in 1974. The Corporation aired another investigation earlier this year in which Shirley Robey, a PA who worked for Lucan's associate Lord Aspinall, said she booked tickets for Mr Bingham and his sisters to fly to Gabon to see their father. Mr Bingham attacked the broadcaster for indulging in 'low-grade speculation [and] wholly unsupported journalism' with public money. Lucan vanished without a trace 38 . years ago after the brutal killing of Sandra Rivett, nanny to his . children, at his family's home in Belgravia, Central London, on November . 7, 1974. Since the killing . and the aristocrat's disappearance, detectives have developed a theory . that Lucan killed Miss Rivett by mistake, believing she was his wife . with whom he was embroiled in divorce proceedings. It . is thought that the Earl went on to commit suicide, but rumours have . since abounded that the Earl, aided by associates at the highest levels . of the British Establishment, fled the country to evade justice. Mr Bingham with his father before the Earl's disappearance in 1974: Mr Bingham attacked rumours about his father being spread by the BBC . Sandra Rivett, nanny to Lord Lucan's children, was found dead in Belgravia, London, in November 1974 . Although Mr Bingham, who was aged just . seven and in the house at the time of the killing, believes his father . is innocent of the murder, he is adamant that Lucan did indeed go on to . commit suicide. As a . teenager he says he 'forgot about' his father, and it was only when . Lucan was declared officially dead in 1992, when Mr Bingham was 32, that . memories began to haunt him. His . struggle to come to terms with the lurid speculation came to a head 13 . years ago when he burned everything he owned that reminded him of his . father. 'It’s one thing not . knowing if your father is alive or dead, but quite another thing to . rise each day to hear others claiming they have seen him,' he told the . Mirror. He described how, . feeling close to a 'collapse of the mind', he gathered together . everything he could relating to his father, including papers, books and . photographs. 'I dumped them in a supermarket trolley and took them to a waste site and watched as they all went up in flames,' he said.

Shooter: Eddie Ray Routh, 25, was arrested for allegedly shooting two people dead, including the 'deadliest sniper' in U.S. Military history . The deadliest sniper in US history has been shot dead at point blank range by a veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Chris Kyle, 39, was blasted in the back by Eddie Ray Routh, 25, after taking him on an outing to a shooting range to help him deal with his demons. Routh also allegedly shot dead his neighbor Chad Littlefield, 35, who was on the trip too. Kyle’s death sparked a huge outpouring of tributes across America with many saying that he was a ‘true American hero’. He notched up 255 kills during the Iraq war and became so feared by insurgents they put a $80,000 bounty on his head and nicknamed him al-Shaitan Ramad, or ‘the Devil of Ramadi’. In one battle alone he shot dead 40 enemy soldiers although his greatest achievement was his longest kill - from a staggering 1.2 miles away. Kyle told of his career in his memoir called ‘American Sniper’ which went on sale last month and became an instant bestseller. He also worked with with veterans charity the FITCO Cares Foundation, which is where he appears to have come into contact with Routh. The shooting happened at the Rough Creek Lodge near Stephenville in Texas on Saturday evening. Routh is said to have ‘turned on’ his two victims and shot them before tried to flee the scene in Kyle’s pickup truck. The former marine - who was reportedly highly trained in the use of firearms - was arrested around 9pm following a chase and is now in custody. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kyle, 39, served four tours in Irag and he was awarded two Silver Stars, five Bronze Stars with Valor, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and one Navy and Marine Corps Commendation . Caught: Police searched for Routh for hours following the shooting on Saturday afternoon and he allegedly fled the scene at the shooting range, taking off in Kyle's pick up truck . In custody: Routh is seen here wearing black being put into the back of a police car . Routh is now expected to be charged with capital murder over the double shooting. Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said that he had ‘no clue’ as to the motive but US reports focused on Routh’s PTSD. In interviews Kyle himself has told of how hard it is to leave the military and said it left you with ‘no identity’. He left the service in 2009 in order to save his marriage to wife Taya and spend more time with their two children. While in Iraq, Kyle survived being shot twice . and he lived through six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie . company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat . Kyle recorded more than 150 sniper kills - the most in U.S. military history - between 1999 and 2009 . Until then his life seemed like a film script and with his death the chances of Hollywood coming calling have increased dramatically. Kyle grew up in Texas and in his youth was a professional bronco rider who dreamed of becoming a cowboy. Instead he became a soldier and when faced with his first kill - an Iraqi woman armed with a hand grenade - he was so reticent he had to be ordered to shoot by his commander. That anxiety soon disappeared and during his 10 year military career as a member of the elite SEAL Team 3 he survived being shot twice, lost two of his closest friends and lived through six near-death explosions. Scene: The shooting happened at the Rough Creek Lodge near Stephenville in Texas on Saturday evening . He saw action in every major battle during Operation Iraqi Freedom using his trusty .300 Win Mag, a bolt-action precision sniper rifle which he said would ‘shoot like a laser’. Kyle, whose parents are a Sunday school teacher and a church deacon, has said he had no regrets about his life and claimed to have a ‘clear conscience’ before God. In his memoir he said: ‘It was my duty to shoot the enemy, and I don't regret it. ‘My regrets are for the people I couldn't save: Marines, soldiers, buddies... Kyle, a husband and father of two, authored the New York Times best-seller 'American Sniper,' which chronicled his four tours in Iraq . Ex-Navy Seal Chris Kyle, author of 'American Sniper,' and a neighbor of his were shot point-blank by another veteran . ‘...After the first kill, the others . come easy. I don’t have to psych myself up, or do anything mentally - I . look through the scope, get the target in the cross hairs and kill my . enemy before he kills one of my people.’ Kyle’s feat puts him amongst the sniping elite, but he is far from the best in history. That . title falls to Finland’s Simo Häyhä who shot dead 542 Soviet soldiers . during World War II, earning him the nickname ‘White Death’. The longest shot ever taken was in November 2009 by British soldier Craig Harrison. After leaving the Navy, he started his own military contracting firm, Craft International, which provides military and law enforcement sniper training . This is the Rough Creek Lodge gun range where Kyle was shot . The . Household Cavalryman hit two Taliban fighters from 3,000ft, the length . of 25 football pitches - outside of his weapon’s effective range. Kyle’s . death comes at a time when gun laws are under the microscope in the US . with President Barack Obama trying to clamp down on the sale of assault . rifles. ABC News reported that senior military commanders and former colleagues of Kyle were heartbroken at the death of a ‘legend’. On . Twitter however some claimed his death was due to bad karma and a .

"By . Martin Robinson . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 2 November 2011 . Jealous: Dalwara Singh slipped steroids into his wife's dinners and drinks, causing her to break out in spots and grow hair all over her body . A controlling and jealous husband secretly fed his wife steroids so she would pile on weight and be forced to stay at home and look after their children. Victim Jaspreet Singh Gill sprouted hair on her chin, cheeks and back because Dalwara Singh was lacing her food and drink with the drugs, Leicester Crown Court heard. The mother of two also developed spotty, constantly itchy skin and some scalp hair fell out, but her husband of 17 years told her not to go to the doctor. When she complained that the food he suddenly starting preparing for her tasted bitter, because of the steroids, Mr Singh made her eat it out of guilt, saying he had made it especially for her. Their teenage daughter told her mother she heard her father grinding a pestle and mortar in the bedroom. Mrs Singh broke into a locked cupboard and found the anabolic steroids, Anapolon and Dianabol, and called the police. Singh, a food factory production manager, of Empire Road, Leicester, admitted administering a poison or noxious substance with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy, between November last year and January this year. He avoided jail and was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, with supervision, and ordered to attend a domestic abuse programme. Sentencing him, Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: 'You've escaped prison by the skin of your teeth. 'Over a period of weeks you secreted steroids designed for athletes to gain muscles and put it into your wife's food and drink. 'You say you didn't want to hurt her but just wanted her to gain weight. You stood by and watched the effects it had on your wife. Lucky: Judge Ebraham Mooncey told Dalwara Singh that he narrowly avoided jail because of his actions . 'You may have been doing it to make her give up her job, gain weight and stay indoors - and make her want you and rely on you. 'It was a well-planned exercise and you say you gave her the steroids at least four or five times. 'She trusted you. It's had a terrible effect on her, causing long-term emotional harm.' Caroline Bray, prosecuting, said: 'They were married for 17 years and have a son and daughter, aged 15 and 16. 'It doesn't look to have been a happy marriage and he'd been verbally and physically abusive in the past. 'She felt controlled by him. 'Early in the marriage she didn't enjoy normal freedoms like getting a job, socialising and couldn't choose what she wore. 'He constantly accused her of infidelity and having affairs.' Mrs Singh had considered that her husband was trying to sabotage her attempt to lose weight and in December last year he gave her a larger dose, in wine, causing swelling and severe pain to her nose which made her think she had the flu. After a row the next day, she claimed Singh said: 'You should have died yesterday, but you didn't' and in a later police interview, Singh said: 'I just wanted her to gain weight.' David Martin-Sperry, mitigating, said: 'It's a truly bizarre case. 'He's deeply embarrassed and appalled, ashamed and bitterly regrets it. 'He did it so she'd gain weight to get back to the pattern of their life, so she'd cook dinner and look after the children, so she wouldn't go out for walks to lose weight. Strange: Leicester Crown Court, pictured, heard that Singh was ashamed of what he had done . 'There are some jurisdictions for example where a woman isn't allowed to have a driving licence or an education. They are concepts taking us back to the Dark Ages. 'Yes, he was controlling in the relationship and however much you may disapprove it as a way to conduct affairs in modern Britain, it's something that exists in some parts of some communities. 'I'm not an apologist for it, but it's not in itself against the law.' Singh was made the subject of a restraining order, banning contact with his estranged wife, other than through solicitors or social services, or visiting her address. He was also told to pay £350 costs.","Jaspreet Singh Gill sprouted hair on her chin, cheeks and back after her husband laced her food and drink with drugs .

These would be the words to describe Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge. And while his outing on the Wii U is an improvement over other console versions, fundamental issues in the gameplay blunt Ninja Gaiden’s blade yet again. Plot wise, and it’s standard fare for the series. Ryu gets a visit from the hilariously named Japan’s Self Defense Force, calling on him to help stop the Lords of Alchemy carrying out terrorist attacks around the world. Just doesn't cut it: Parts of Razor's Edge are OK, but it's mostly very repetitive . It’s not long before a head-to head with one of them, the Regent of the Mask, results in Ryu acquiring the Grip of Murder – an ugly growth on his arm that feeds on the deaths of others. This is where the gameplay comes in, which primarily revolves around chopping off as many enemy limbs as possible. Although new upgradable weapons and abilities offer some much-needed variation to proceedings, combat gets very boring, very quickly. It’s made all the more worse by the awful soundtrack, which pops up every time enemies comically jump over fences (or other ‘no-go’ areas) and run towards you – often blurting out pointless expletives in an attempt to sound threatening. Levels are so incredibly lazily laid out, that you can easily predict when the next gruelling battle will take place. Graphics remain mostly bland, with almost non-existent textures, but Ryu himself is quite well animated - especially in the cut-scenes. AI, too, is a mixed bag. Indeed, one of the game’s strengths is its difficulty curve, and enemies will soon get wise to the same one-button combo. They'll also keep coming at you, even if they're missing limbs, so it's important to quickly finish them off with one of Ryu's gruesome executions. Bloody: The comically-named Grip of Murder glows red when Ryu starts killing things . This is where Razor's Edge is at its best - where it forces you to use the game’s complex combinations. Thankfully, weapons can be upgraded and moves unlocked, with the GamePad acting primarily as an inventory. This generally works well. The campaign, too, boasts two more missions, and you can also play as Ayame from the Dead or Alive series.

Torn: Linebacker Reuben Foster got an Auburn tattoo before pledging to play for their state rivals Alabama . Five-star linebacker prospect Reuben Foster says he'll play for Alabama after a recruiting process that left him torn between the state's two rivals — and sporting an Auburn tattoo. The Auburn High School star said Monday night on Fox SportsSouth that he plans to sign with the two-time defending national champion Crimson Tide over the Tigers — where he had committed at one point — and Georgia. Foster is rated the nation's No. 2 prospect by Scout.com and a five-star player by each of the major recruiting services. He said he made his decision 'on my way up here. 'I was just confused,' Foster said on 'The New College Football Show' with daughter A'Ziya perched on his lap. 'I went on the air and just came out with the heart.' Foster, regarded as the nation's top inside linebacker prospect, says he has been an Alabama fan 'since I was a pup.' That didn't make the recruiting process simpler, though. He had switched his initial commitment from Alabama to rival Auburn, and then withdrew his pledge to the Tigers after the firing of coach Gene Chizik. Before flipping, though, he got an Auburn tattoo etched onto his right forearm. Foster left his visit to Auburn on the final recruiting weekend and headed to Tuscaloosa. His indecision had led some fans to express their ire on social media. 'It's crazy how fans blow up your Twitter and call you names and it hurt,' Foster said. Tattoo blunder: Foster had this Auburn tattoo inked on his arm shortly after committing to play for the team. But he withdrew his pledge after coach Gene Chizik was fired and had said he will play for rivals Alabama instead . Nick Saban's Tide was already flirting with the nation's top recruiting class again, and Foster's signing would be a big boost. The intense, often scowling Saban has led Alabama to three of the last four national titles. Foster said he saw the coach's lighter side. 'Everybody says coach Saban's uptight,' he said. 'He's not uptight with me. He's just trying to get the job done. He's smiling, having fun.' Foster and other high school seniors around the nation can sign scholarships with their chosen colleges starting Wednesday.

Out: Kate O'Day, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Children's Services, has resigned amid scrutiny of how her agency was handling cases of children who died after investigations of abuse and neglect . The embattled commissioner of Tennessee's Department of Children’s Services has resigned amid an . investigation into at least 151 children who died while in their care in . a three and a half-year period. Gov Bill Haslam announced Kate O’Day’s resignation on Tuesday in a news release while stating no mention of the investigation nor any admitted wrongdoing. 'She was concerned that she had become more of a focus than the children the department serves,' Haslam said in the release. He wasn't immediately available to comment. The Republican governor last week defended O'Day's leadership, even after the agency told a federal judge it couldn't say with any certainty how many children died while in its custody. The department previously reported the deaths of 151 children in their custody between January of 2009 and July of 2012 but retracted that number after a third party reported that number to be less than exact. They now say they are not sure how many have died. According to the Tennessean in the first six month of 2012 there were 31 deaths among children, ranging from newborns to teenagers. The deaths originally reported by DCS included infants, toddlers, grad-schoolers and teenagers. The causes of death included bodily fractures or injuries, gunshot wounds, natural causes and drug exposure. DCS had since been sued by The Tennessean, The Associated Press and 10 other news organizations to obtain case records of those 151 children and had been the subject of state investigations of abuse or neglect. 'It’s something the public has a right to know about as it pertains to the safety of children,' Chattanooga Times Free Press Managing Editor Alison Gerber told the Tennessean. O’Day previously said that the names are being kept secret ‘not to protect DCS, they’re really to protect the families,’ according to the newspaper. Chancellor Carol McCoy ruled last month that DCS, which had claimed it was keeping the records closed to protect the children's privacy, had to release hundreds of pages from four cases to the news organizations after identifying information was redacted. A decision on whether more records were to be released is pending. Numbers: The department, pictured, admitted to the deaths of 151 children in their custody between January of 2009 and July of 2012 before redacting that figure that was later accused as too low . Attorneys for the agency last week said it would cost at least $55,584.55 to make all records publicly available. They tallied costs including extra administrative assistants for filing and copying, extra paralegals, hand transportation across state, and enormous supplies of white out. DCS has been under federal court oversight for more than a decade over problems in Tennessee's foster care system. Less than two weeks ago DCS told a federal judge that it couldn't accurately count how many children have died in its custody, saying its tracking system had missed nine deaths in 2011 and 2012. In December a quarter of the state’s child abuse hotline were also found going unanswered, the Tennessean reported. The revelation and increasing calls for DCS to improve its performance have threatened to derail more than 10 years of work to resolve a long-running lawsuit over the agency's handling of foster care. Thus far, officials have not been able to explain how DCS overlooked the nine deaths except to say that it was the result of human error. DCS’ operations are currently being monitored by a third party which was the first to discover the additional unreported deaths according to WBIR. The department is now trying to get out of that consent order. Haslam has named Commissioner Jim Henry, the head of the Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, to serve as interim commissioner of DCS. O'Day had been commissioner since January 2011, when she was appointed by Haslam. Before that she was president and chief executive officer of Child & Family Tennessee in Knoxville.","Kate O'Day has served as commissioner of state's Department of Children's Services since January of 2011 .

Facebook frustration: Two-thirds of Facebook users say they're spending less time on the site due to its 'drama' and boredom . Too much drama, boredom and scads of irrelevant information are just some of the reasons Facebook users give for taking a break from the world's biggest social networking site for weeks at a time, according to a new study. A report from the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project found that some 61 per cent of Facebook users had taken a hiatus of at least several weeks for a myriad of reasons, whether they were weary from an onslaught of gossip, or for the more pious, the arrival of Lent. Yet the use of Facebook, whether constant or not, is pervasive in America. Of the American adults who use the Internet, 67 per cent are on Facebook, Pew found. That compares with 20 per cent who use LinkedIn and 16 percent who are on Twitter. But users do come and go, some temporarily, and some for good. Twenty per cent of those with Internet access said they used the site at one point, but no longer do. By its own count, Facebook Inc. has 1.06 billion users worldwide who check in at least once a month. This includes millions of duplicate and fake accounts. More than 150 million users are in the U.S. The largest slice of users, 20 per cent, said that they were simply too busy with their own lives to follow the constant stream of status updates, George Takei quotes and baby photos. Privacy and security concerns, which have received plenty of media coverage, were low on the list. Only 4 per cent of people gave these . reasons, combined with concerns about ads and spam, as their 'Facebook . vacation' motivation. Obsession? Of the American adults who use the Internet, 67 per cent are on Facebook . Firing back: In response to the report, Facebook said that its growth and user engagement remains strong . Lee Rainie, director of the Internet and American Life Project said privacy is more of a big policy question that people do not concern themselves with day-by-day. Rather, people are contemplating how they spend their time and allocate their attention. 'People are making interesting calibrations and recalibrations' about how they spend their time, and the worth of constantly staying connected to friends, family and others on line, Rainie said. And while people do take Facebook breaks, Internet users are logging in more frequently than ever, the study found. Responding to the report, Facebook said that its growth and user engagement remains strong. 'As we announced last week, Facebook has grown daily active users across all regions, ending the year with more than 1 billion monthly active users, 618 million daily active users and 680 million people accessing Facebook from mobile devices,' according to a company statement. 'Our announcement came on the heels of independent analyst reports which concluded that Facebook is the most downloaded mobile app in the U.S., and that time spent on Facebook accounts for over 20 percent of all time spent on mobile apps in the U.S.' The Pew study of 1,006 U.S. adults was done in December.

A photographer was revealed as the winner of a prestigious national award for a stunning picture of a lightning strike - on the day of his funeral. Talented Danny Beath, 52, had entered the Travel Photo of the Year competition seven times before but never won despite making the finals. His incredible image of a storm over poppy fields in Blackstone Nature Reserve in the Severn Valley netted him first prize in this year's contest. But before the organisers could tell the snapper about his win, Danny tragically collapsed outside his house in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and died of a heart attack three week ago. The competition result was announced last Friday afternoon, as Danny's funeral was taking place at the same time in his home town. Danny, who held a PhD in Tropical Ecology had won many awards, including The Shropshire Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2012 and Take a View Landscape Photographer of the Year, run by The Sunday Times. His latest win would have bagged him new camera gear and seen him travel to Papua New Guinea on a photo commission. Lyn Hughes, editor-in-chief of travel magazine and competition organiser Wanderlust, said Danny was a familiar face. She said: 'Danny was thrilled to have made it into the final of the photo awards yet again. Winning image: Danny Beath's picture of a lightning strike at a nature reserve took first prize . 'He was particularly delighted as it was with a British landscape, he had always entered photos from overseas in previous years. 'He commented on our website on how excited he was. We already knew that he had actually won this year, but I couldn't reveal it. 'I just wish he'd known before he'd died, because it would have meant so much to him. He was a great talent and a lovely man.' His father Tim, who lives in Lincolnshire, said Danny would be greatly missed. 'He was held in high regard by a lot of people,' he said.

From fad diets to savvy gadgets, there are hundred of products claiming to aid us in the weight loss cause. And now, the latest slimming aid claims to help women shed pounds simply listening to a daily voice recording. The recording, called a Slimpod, comprises goal-oriented . voice recordings created by behavioural change experts based in Harley . Street. Listen and loose: Barbara Greenwood lost a staggering five and a half stone in less than a year using the slimpods . It claims to gently retune the . mind, change people’s relationships with food and make them eat . less, feel full quicker and make better choices – all without even . having to think about it. The new weight loss technique was put to the test by Barbara Greenwood, who lost a staggering five and a half stone in less than a year using the method. The 48-year-old community worker from Mansfield, Notts, dropped from a size 28 to a size 18 after using the system. Her BMI has gone from 46 to 32 - and last week her nurse took her off her main type 2 diabetes medication. Speaking about her weight loss she said: 'I’m so glad I found out about Slimpods because years of dieting didn’t make me lose weight. Now I have a new lease of life.' For almost 40 years, Barbara has had massive problems with her weight. She would binge and diet and decades of dieting achieved nothing because any weight she lost went straight back on again. Biggest loser: : Barbara with Alain Mehada from Debenhams Personal Shoppers holding up her old size 30 trousers after her BareMinerals makeover . She said: 'At 14, I was 13st 7lbs. By my late twenties, I crossed the line into morbid obesity. 'At 34, I was 21st and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My all time heaviest a few years ago was 22st and size 30.' Life was becoming unbearable. Barbara even struggled to cut her own toenails or put her shoes and socks on because of her weight problem. 'At the back end of last year I reached breaking point because the many ways in which my weight was affecting my quality of life became intolerable, . 'I suffered excessive sweating all through that summer and autumn, I had frequent indigestion and acid reflux, pain in my knees and hips, and just generally felt dreadful. 'Not to mention the little humiliations of seat-belt extensions and not being able to lay the tray-table flat on an aeroplane, avoiding chairs with arms in public places, and all the other things that the morbidly obese suffer,' she said. Slimming down: Life was becoming unbearable and Barbara even struggled to cut her own toenails or put her shoes and socks on because of her weight problem but she has a new found confidence . With her husband’s help she made a New Year resolution to make one last attempt at changing her eating habits and by mid-February 2012 she had lost over a stone. But the urge to eat more was overwhelming and soon Barbara stopped her diet and started to wonder if gastric surgery was the only answer. 'Then one day I was Googling weight loss and I came across Slimpods mentioned on a weight loss support forum, . 'Something just clicked, and I decided to give it a go, so I bought a Slimpod. That day I weighed 20st 2lbs. Eleven months later I’ve lost 5st 7lbs and I’m a size 18. 'The effects were dramatic - right away, I could hear the voice saying ""one bite at a time"" whenever I ate something and ""listen to the signal from your body that you've had enough to eat."" 'Within a few days I was leaving food on my plate, declining biscuits with no struggle at all, and soon had to give myself smaller portions. 'I no longer binge eat, seldom eat enough that I feel stuffed, and I find that I can enjoy small amounts of treats, which are treats, and not a staple food which I eat lots of every day.' Every year the company behind the Slimpod, Thinking Slimmer, holds The Slimpod Stars awards, of which Barbara was the winner. To celebrate her success she was treated to a makeover by the Personal Shopping team at Debenhams on Oxford Street. For the first time in ten years, Barbara put on a dress and wore make up, and her transformation was stunning. Speaking about the makeover she said: 'After decades of clothes shopping being a necessary evil when I would be grateful to find one or two things that would fit me, it has become a delight. 'When the personal shopper at Debenhams, Alain, said he was going to put me in a dress I have to say I took some convincing! But he was right and I was amazed at how fantastic it looked. 'I felt feminine for the first time in many, many years. Alain even got me in peep toe heels!' She added: 'Suddenly with my new size I’m overwhelmed by colours and styles, not yet knowing who I am because I’ve not been able to develop a personal style before. 'Until now I just bought whatever clothes would hide the bulges. Today I have choice for the first time and exploring what works for me is both scary and wonderful at the same time. 'Today I am confident that my new shape and new confidence in myself is here to stay.' Thinking Slimmer’s founder Sandra Roycroft-Davis said: 'Many people diet because they think there's no other way. Now we’ve changed all that, making it possible to lose weight and love the skin you’re in. 'Constant dieting often has horrendous psychological effects manifesting in low confidence, obsession with calories, deprivation, bingeing and generally feeling out of control. 'I’m very proud that our Slimpods reverse these effects and help people have a normal relationship with food.'

Emily Shephard, 18, had to learn to walk again after losing control of the left side of her body. She was worried the condition had robbed her of her smile but was able to beam just months later after she took the top prize in a beauty pageant. Emily Shephard was paralysed down her left side.

Emily suddenly collapsed with a life-threatening stroke which paralysed her down her left side. She said: 'My left leg went tingly and I fell to the ground.

A football-mad four-year-old boy has been refused an operation to enable him to walk and play his favourite sport due to an NHS postcode lottery. Jack Rooke suffers from cerebral . palsy but a procedure available at a hospital just seven miles away could make a dramatic difference to his life. His family have now launched an appeal to raise £35,000 to pay for the surgery privately after his local NHS trust refused to provide funding. Jack Rooke, 4, with his mother Hannah Trimby. They live just seven miles from a hospital that performs the surgery Jack needs to walk, but NHS Bristol won't fund it . His parents Hannah Trimby, 26, and Sam Rooke, from Whitchurch, Bristol, are angry that his fate has been decided by a postcode lottery in which some primary care trusts provide funding while others do not. Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Source: SCOPE . Full-time mother Hannah, said: 'I'm fuming that living so close to the hospital doesn't mean that Jack will get the surgery. 'You would think you would have to be in the area to get the surgery.' Jack suffers from spastic cerebral palsy, meaning muscle tightness in his legs makes it impossible for him to walk unaided and he relies on a specialist frame. He needs an operation known as an SDR - selective dorsal rhizotomy - which involves cutting the tight muscles and nerve endings in order to loosen the legs and make them more agile. Frenchay Hospital in Bristol has carried out 37 of these procedures since they became available in May, but around 20 of these have been funded privately. After the operation, patients need months of intensive physiotherapy to strengthen their legs. Hannah added: 'It is his dream - it would be amazing for him to be able to walk on his own, and hopefully the surgery will help prevent him from needing more orthopaedic surgery in the future.' Neurosurgeon Kristian Aquilina, who performs the operation at Frenchay, believes Jack is eligible for the treatment. Unfortunately for Ben his local primary care trust - NHS Bristol - does not fund the procedure. Sam, a plumber, said: 'Jack loves football and loves music. He knows he can't walk and that other children his age can and he knows he has cerebral palsy and about the operation. 'Jack doesn't let it hold him back and is the happiest kid I know. But because at the moment he crawls, he cannot kick a ball unless you hold his hands.' Fundraising: Jack is hoping that next year he will be able to walk unaided and kick a football for the first time . Later this month, Hannah and a friend are hoping to raise money by sitting in a bath of porridge while having their hair washed in gravy. Jack was born prematurely, at just 28 weeks, weighing 2lb 12oz, and after spending the first 11 weeks of his young life in neonatal intensive care, doctors discovered he had developed cerebral palsy due to brain damage he suffered in the womb. He suffers from a form of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia, which means he cannot stand or walk unaided. Bristol-based charity Cerebral Palsy Plus helps local sufferers and their parents cope with the debilitating condition. Spokeswoman Cathy Truman said: 'A . number of our members are individually fund-raising to get the surgery . themselves, because Bristol NHS won't pay for it. We will support them with that as much as we can. 'What they are doing at Frenchay is cutting edge - it's one of the few places in the country that can perform the surgery. 'It is ironic that this cutting-edge surgery is based here in Bristol and yet is not funded locally.' The Frenchay Hospital in Bristol is one of just four centres in the UK that perform selective dorsal rhizotomy . A spokesperson for NHS Bristol said: 'The Primary Care Trusts have been in discussions with North Bristol NHS Trust which is keen to establish a service for SDR. 'During the course of these discussions, it became clear that this was a high cost specialist procedure which required regional or national commissioning rather, than locally, to avoid inequitable access to the treatment. 'The newly formed National Commissioning Board is currently consulting on a draft policy across England on the provision of Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy for children with spasticity secondary to Cerebral Palsy.'

Leo Lake, from Hove, has a rare condition known as Joubert syndrome, which means bright light irritates his eyes so much that he can't see anything at all. His eyes are so sensitive even the reflective glare of the sun off snow can leave him in agony. Leo Lake, pictured with mother Hannah, wears his prescription sunglasses all day as sunlight irritates his eyes . 'Magic glasses': Leo's mother Hannah said: 'Luckily he thinks his shades are cool' With the sunglasses, he can see a metre in front of him, which his mother Hannah says is more than she could have ever hoped for. The 27-year-old said: 'Without his glasses, he can't see in bright lights and sunlight, it's excruciatingly painful for him, he just screams and cries. 'I hope that within his life time the cure will be made available.' Leo was born in South Africa after his grandmother moved there to fulfil her dream of owning a guest house. Ms Lake said: 'When he was five weeks old, I realised that when I spoke to him he would smile but in the wrong direction. 'I took him to the doctors because I knew something was wrong, but they kept telling me he was fine and they couldn't tell whether he could see or not. It was very frustrating. 'Eventually after numerous tests they told me he could be blind and I was just devastated. 'I'd never had any contact with blind people before and I was worried I wouldn't be able to give him the care he needed. 'But at the same time, a part of me still believed he wasn't blind, I was sure he had vision.' Hannah with Leo as a baby: She said she noticed he smiled in the wrong direction from the age of five weeks . Leo, who is registered blind, loves cars, trucks and trains . Hannah moved back to the UK when Leo was 10 months old because she believed he could receive better healthcare. She said: 'When we first moved back Leo seemed a lot happier, I missed the sunshine, but was much better. So we had numerous tests, but nothing was being diagnosed. 'It was at the age of two when he still wasn't walking that I became really concerned.' When Leo was three years old he was finally diagnosed at Moorfields Eye Hospital with Joubert syndrome. The syndrome is a rare genetic condition with which the cerebellum, part of the brain that controls balance and co-ordination, is underdeveloped. Symptoms include poor sight and problems with movement as well as sensitivity to sunlight and bright lights. Currently there is no cure, but Hannah set up her own foundation, VisKid, last year with the hope of raising enough money to one day cure Leo's curse. Leo with a train set: His mother hopes to raise £250,000 to fund research into his rare condition . So far she has managed to raise £1,500, but £250,000 is needed to fund the three-year research into what is a realistic cure. Ms Lake said: 'Leo knows he's different to other children, but he still doesn't fully understand his condition. 'He's very popular with the other kids, they love him, so luckily his glasses haven't caused too much of a stir at school. 'People ask him why he wears sunglasses all the time, I tell him to say they're his magic glasses to help him see. 'Luckily he thinks his shades are cool.' Leo is registered blind and has ataxia and kidney cysts that will eventually lead to kidney failure. Hannah said: 'Apart from not being able to play sports properly because of his balance, Leo's just a typical boy, he loves cars, trucks and trains. 'I wouldn't be surprised if he became a train-spotter.'

For most 21-year-old women, a trip to a spa or the theatre are a nice way to spend a weekend. But for Stephanie Knight these are her precious dying wishes. The student, from Braughing, Hertfordshire, has been bravely battling cancer since she was 17 years old but learned on New Year's Day this year that her condition is now terminal. So she decided to draw up a list of things she would like to do in her final months. Scroll down to hear from Steph . Brave battle: Stephanie, pictured left before she was diagnosed with a rare cancer, and pictured right today . Stephanie, pictured in hospital, has refused to give up fighting her cancer and plans to set up a local charity to help other teenagers with cancer . Unusual requests include learning how to de-cork a bottle with a sword and to hold her own fake wedding. 'She has always wanted to get married and have lots of babies but has found it hard to have a partner while undergoing treatment, despite being a very pretty girl,' her sister said. 'She wants to at least have tried on dresses and had a hen do before she goes. It doesn't matter that it's not for real. 'We're planning to go all out for the hen do. The local landlady and our friends have been talking about naked butlers or maybe even a stripper - if Steph allows it. 'Steph was too young to come to mine and was having treatment when our older sister got married.' But many of her requests are modest ones - she would like to finish her course and qualify as a nursery nurse and watch a sunset in a beautiful place. Stephanie (right) is pictured enjoying a night out with friends before her treatment. She lost her hair following chemotherapy . She would love to go on holiday with her family and dogs, to the seaside with her nieces and nephews and to enjoy a 'normal' drunken night in the pub. Perhaps more poignantly many of her wishes are for others. She wants to arrange for her sister to meet Gary Barlow or Robbie Williams and take her father to meet the Manchester United squad. Another wish is simply 'to make someone's cancer experience slightly happier to get through.' Her sister Rachel Cross, 31, said: 'Steph is such a selfless person. For her it's more about memories for us as well as fun experiences for herself. 'She wants us to have good memories of her rather than all the hospital memories.' Miss Knight was diagnosed with Ewings sarcoma in 2009 after doctors found a tumour the size of a tennis ball in the back of her pelvis. By the time treatment started it had grown to cover the whole right side of her pelvis. She responded well to 10 rounds of chemotherapy and three lots of radiotherapy in the first year and went into remission in October 2010. She returned to college to complete her second year of her child education course and started working in a local nursery. Stephanie is determined to enjoy her life despite often being in agonising pain due to the cancer. A common side-effect of treatment is weight gain . Stephanie has achieved one dream already of meeting David Walliams and Amanda Holden from Britain's Got Talent . But just as Stephanie and her family were hoping she had turned the corner, they discovered the soft-tissue cancer has returned. She started chemotherapy again in April 2012 but this time it failed to work. In October last year she had her right leg and part of her pelvis removed but after the surgery doctors found the cancer has returned to her stump. Two previously benign tumours in her lungs had also grown nearly an inch each. On New Years Day doctors told her and her family they would not be able to save her life and could only now try to prolong it as much as possible. Rachel said: 'New Years' Day was awful. The doctors said Steph would never be free of the cancer, but they would manage it as best they could. 'They told us the cancer had returned to her amputated stump and chest and lung area. 'Then 10 days later a consultant confirmed the cancer was terminal but they would do what they could to keep her with us for as long as possible.' Stephanie with a new relation: She was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 17 . Stephanie lost her leg to cancer in October last year (right). But after the surgery they found the cancer had returned to her stump . VIDEO 'One day never seems to come otherwise'. Brave Steph explains her bucket list plans . Stephanie has had another round of . chemotherapy and is due to have two more in the next three months in an . attempt to prolong her life. She was given a nerve blocking treatment this week, which has taken away the pain from her stump and will hopefully enable her to attempt some of her bucket list wishes. She was inspired to draw up the bucket list by friends at the Teenage Cancer Trust Unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Rachel, who is a mother-of-three, said: 'She has spent so much time in hospital and she feels that she has wasted it. She is determined not to waste any more time.' Steph would love to to meet Gary Barlow or Robbie Williams and wants her sister to share the treat . Stephanie also plans to set up a local charity named Steph's Wishes to help teenagers suffering from cancer by providing essential equipment for rehabilitation. She has already helped to raise more than £40,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust since 2009 - the charity which funded Ward C9 at Addenbrooke's Hospital. Rachel said: 'We are determined to fight it for as long as we can and to help her do all the things she wants to do.'

Accused: Surgeon Ian Paterson is suspected of performing 'lumpectomy' surgery on 450 women instead of performing a simple biopsy to check for cancer . An NHS trust yesterday announced an independent inquiry into its handling of complaints about a surgeon alleged to have carried out more than 1,000 botched or unnecessary breast operations. Ian Paterson is suspected of performing ‘lumpectomy’ surgery on 450 women instead of performing a simple biopsy to check for cancer. He is also alleged to have performed his own ‘cleavage-sparing’ mastectomies (CSM) on around 700 more. The procedure, which he invented, leaves some breast tissue intact for cosmetic reasons, but is not approved in Britain because residual tissue could lead to an increased risk of the disease returning. Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust announced lawyer Sir Ian Kennedy will chair the review into how managers at Solihull Hospital and Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, reacted to concerns ‘raised by staff, patients and the public’ about the surgeon’s work. The review, which follows investigations already underway by the General Medical Council and West Midlands Police, will also consider if bosses acted appropriately on those concerns and responded to them ‘in a timely manner’. Paterson worked at three NHS and two private hospitals across the Midlands from 1994 until he was suspended last October. Police are also investigating the surgeon to see whether he should be charged with assault over the allegations he performed unnecessary surgery on 450 patients who did not have cancer. In the aftermath of the announcement of those inquiries, some patients spoke of how their lives had been ‘ruined’ by the surgeon, while others spoke out in his support. Hundreds of the women operated on by Paterson are believed to have launched claims for compensation against either the Trust or Spire Healthcare, which ran the two private hospitals where he worked in Solihull and Sutton Coldfield. Action: Solicitor Kashmir Uppal (centre) with (l-r) Paula Gelsthorpe, Victoria Weaver, Rachel Butler, Gail Boichat, Helen Gardiner and Marie Bailey, who are all taking legal action against surgeon Ian Paterson . The majority of the procedures took place at Solihull Hospital. Many of the women believed they were having a full mastectomy, only to discover they had not. The Trust wrote to all those women on its records operated on by Mr Paterson last year, asking them to get in touch. Heart of England NHS Trust said Paterson had carried out only a ‘very small number’ of operations at Good Hope, in the late 1990s, while he had not performed any surgery at Solihull since May 2011. Needless: Paula Gelsthorpe, 54, from Birmingham, had needless lumpectomies in 2002 and 2009 and said she suffered ¿an assault on the body and mind¿ . Sir Ian will make recommendations to the trust’s board in a public report expected to be completed by the summer. Lord Philip Hunt, chairman of the Heart of England trust, said the review would ‘determine whether there are lessons to be learned about how the organisation responded to the situation as it evolved, and how it might improve its response to concerns if they are raised in the future.’ Some of the women treated by Paterson said they felt mentally tortured by being led to believe they were seriously ill when, in fact, they were perfectly healthy. Paula Gelsthorpe, 54, from Birmingham, had needless lumpectomies in 2002 and 2009 and told the Daily Mail she suffered ‘an assault on the body and mind’. The Trust was first alerted to concerns about Paterson in 2007. He was ordered to stop the CSM technique. Spire Healthcare was informed and also asked the surgeon to stop the procedures. But some patients have told their lawyers that he continued CSM at the private hospitals before finally being banned from all surgery at the hospitals in August 2011. The married surgeon lives in a £1m Grade II-listed townhouse in Edgbaston, Birmingham. There was no answer at the property yesterday. Paterson, a father-of-three, is being represented by the Medical Defence Union. A spokesman said: ‘He (Paterson) is fully co-operating with the GMC investigation. ‘He cannot comment further because of patient confidentiality and the ongoing investigation.’ Sir Ian previously conducted a major inquiry into children’s heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary and currently chairs Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) monitoring MPs’ expenses. Police are also thought to be investigating accusations Paterson made false claims to health insurers, allegedly claiming for more expensive operations than he performed and for others which were never carried out.

Drowned: David Cox had died after his car rolled into an icy river while he was on the school run . The wife of a man who died yesterday when his car skidded into an icy river has praised her children's bravery after they tried to save their father. David and Ruth Cox were driving their children to school in separate cars when both vehicles slid into the river only moments apart. Mrs Cox, 39, and the couple's children Ioan, nine, and Tess, 11, managed to escape the flooding vehicles. But as the rest of his family fled, BBC worker Mr Cox, 42, was said to have been unconscious in the front of his blue Toyota Aygo . Mrs Cox, 39, said she was 'very proud' of son Ioan and daughter Tess, who raised the alarm with neighbours after escaping the freezing water. In an heartfelt statement, Mrs Cox said: 'We were a very happy family and I will do my utmost to make us a happy family again.' She described how Tess 'held her breath and dived under the water' in an attempt to flee the vehicle, before swimming to the far riverbank. Witnesses described how the children ran to cottages three-quarters of a mile down the remote path, as Ioan told neighbours ‘Daddy’s . trapped’. Mrs Cox also praised her nine-year-old son for 'keeping calm' while the car was 'filling with water' and attempting to break the back window. Recalling the incident on the River Wye, only half-a-mile from . the family’s cottage at Blackwell Mill, near Buxton, Derbyshire, she said: 'We were both able to get out of the car . and onto the river bank. Father-of-two David Cox has died after he and his wife crashed their cars while taking their children to separate schools . 'I am very proud of how they ran back down the . lane to the cottages to raise the alarm.' She described her husband David as a 'wonderful, loving father, husband, brother and son' - adding that he 'loved living at Blackwell Mill and working for the BBC'. Mrs Cox also reserved praise for her 'wonderful' friends and neighbours, as well as the rescue workers involved. After the incident, neighbours and Mrs Cox frantically tried to free Mr Cox but it was . around 40 minutes before he was carried to the riverbank. A lack of . mobile phone signal in the area and the icy conditions meant emergency . services arrived 30 minutes after the cars left the road. After the incident both the Aygo and the second vehicle, a silver Toyota Rav4, . could be seen upturned side by side in the river. Mr Cox was said to have been unconscious in the front of his car (left). His wife and children managed to escape the car on the right . Emergency vehicles and personnel, including Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, local mountain rescue volunteers, land ambulances, and the air ambulance were called to the scene . The vehicles were later removed from the freezing river as emergency services, including local mountain rescue services, flocked to the scene. Neighbour Victoria Bamber, 32, who was the first person alerted to the . accident by Ioan, waded into the icy water and battled in vain to save . BBC worker Mr Cox. She said: ‘Ioan came banging on the door saying, “There’s been an . accident, Daddy is trapped”. 'When I got to the scene I could only see . the silver 4x4 upside down in the water and Ruth was desperately trying . to find David. I jumped in the water. It was freezing cold and came . above my waist. I kept diving down but I could not see anything. ‘The 4x4 had landed up against the driver’s door (of the Aygo) so David . couldn’t get out. The rear window was smashed and I think that was how . Tess had managed to get out of the car. 'We were trying to get in through . the passenger door but we couldn’t move it. Then I picked up a large . rock and smashed the window. The electrics gave out and the central . locking failed and we got the door open.’ Road: The stretch road beside the stretch of river in Buxton, Derbyshire where the cars plunged into the water . Mrs Cox and both children freed themselves from the vehicles . She said she helped drag Mr . Cox from the car, before the emergency services began CPR on the . riverside. The family were airlifted to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, 20 . miles away, but while the mother and children were released after . treatment, Mr Cox could not be saved. Mrs Bamber said she was in ‘total shock’ at what had unfolded. ‘I can’t . imagine what Ruth is feeling right now. She did everything she could. She did her best to get David out. ‘Now I’m left thinking I let her and the children down. I did my best but it was not enough.’ The slow flowing river was about 3ft deep at the accident scene. Locals . described the condition of the track as appalling, with ice on top of . frozen snow. The family only moved in to the £250,000 property a year . ago. Caitlin Blake, a former neighbour of the couple, from Alton, Hampshire, described Mr Cox as a 'lovely man'. The 33-year-old said: 'David and Ruth were so close. When they lived here they were very private and spent nearly all of their time together. David was always a loving father.' Another former neighbour added: 'David was very family orientated and spent a lot of his time with his children. Police vehicles at the scene of the tragedy in Buxton. A police spokesman described the incident as a 'tragic accident' Rescue teams recover Mr Cox's car. The parents were taking their children to school when the tragedy happened just after 8.30am yesterday morning . 'He would always lend a hand and see if I was all right as I live on my own.' Colleagues of Mr Cox, who worked for the BBC as part of the Future Media team in Salford, paid tribute to him. His job entailed coverage of the Olympics for the corporation's red button service, the interactive text and video system accessed through televisions. Tim Davie, the BBC's acting director general, said: 'We are very sad to learn of David's tragic death. 'He was a popular member of the Future Media team in Salford and had been key to the success of the red button service during the Olympics in the summer. 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues here at the BBC at this difficult time.' Roux Joubert, head of TV and mobile platforms, said: 'David was an important member of the team and played a central role in the department. 'He will be sorely missed by everyone here and our thoughts are with his family at this time."" One of the neighbours said: ‘It’s a really treacherous path along . by the river, they haven’t been here long, perhaps they just weren’t . aware of how dangerous it can be when it’s been snowing.’ Paul Hawker of Buxton fire station said: ‘You can only imagine what his . family and neighbours went through.

America remains the home of plastic surgery with more procedures carried out here than anywhere else, but astonishing new figures reveal that South Koreans are having the most treatments per head of population. The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks. While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is booming with . one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle. America topped the list of countries where the most surgical and non-surgical procedures took place during 2011 . Heidi Montag famously had ten plastic surgery procedures in one day, while Miss South Korea Yu-Mi Kim has also admitted to having cosmetic surgery . Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife. One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper . eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'. It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes. Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery. Even Miss Korea 2012, Kim Yu-Mi, admitted . she went under the knife to achieve her pageant-winning good looks. The . student revealed the secret after photos emerged of her looking very . different at school, but she said she hadn't misled anyone. 'I never said I was born beautiful,' she told Korean media. Plastic surgery procedures that took place in the U.S. in 2011 according to ISAPS . While South Korea topped the table in relative terms, when it came to total numbers of tucks, . peels, fillers, jabs and lifts in their quest for the perfect body, the . U.S. once again cemented its place at the top of the table in the poll . of 20,000 surgeons. There . were 1,094,146 surgical procedures in the U.S. in 2011 . including 284,351 breast augmentation and 223,066 lipoplasty procedures . (where fat is liquefied and sucked out). Tummy tucks (abdominoplasty), . eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) and breast lifts were also very popular . surgical procedures. Botox was by far the most popular non . invasive treatment with 815,150 treatments making up almost a quarter of . the 3,105,246 procedures. Also very common was people using hyaluronic . acid (smooths wrinkles), laser hair removal, microdermabrasion (a . skin-exfoliating treatment) and IPL Laser Treatment (repairs skin . blemishes and sun damage). Certain procedures are also more popular in particular parts of the world. Brazil, . known for its beach culture, performed the most male breast reductions, . bottom implants and 'vaginal rejuvenations' - where tissue in the area . is 'firmed up for a youthful appearance'. South Korea had the most cosmetic procedures when taking population into account in 2010, while the UK came 20th . Meanwhile, nose jobs are popular in Asia, with China, Japan and South Korea among the top five nations for rhinoplasty. The country performing the highest number of breast implants is the U.S., followed by Brazil, Mexico, Italy and China. The U.S. and Brazil also come first and second for the highest number of eye lifts and tummy tucks. Meanwhile, as obesity rates rise a growing number of overweight adults are turning to surgery for a quick fix. Lipoplasty - a procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to liquefy fat beneath the skin's surface before sucking it out  - was the leading invasive procedure worldwide. There were 1,268,287 procedures, which was just a fifth of the total. It was followed by breast enlargement . surgery, with 1,295,251 boob jobs. Third was blepharoplasty, otherwise . known as eyelid surgery, with 703,610 cases and fourth was . abdomnioplasty, otherwise known as tummy tucks, with 553,399 cases.

Shopaholic: Nicola Saxelby stole £340,000 from her employer to fund a shopping addiction and to buy her Siberian Husky, Troy . A book-keeper stole up to £340,000 from her employers over six years to pay for shopping sprees. Nicola Saxelby duped brothers James and Paul Hawkins, who ran a farming business, into signing cheques made out to her and pocketed rent money from their tenants. The mother of two spent the cash at LK Bennett, Laura Ashley, Joules, Barbour, Marks & Spencer, Principles and North Face, a court heard. It is also thought she put some of the proceeds towards buying a Siberian husky called Troy – though this did not form part of the prosecution case against her. Saxelby’s spending compulsion was so serious that ‘dozens and dozens’ of boxes of unopened goods were found at her home. Andrew Wallace, prosecuting, said: ‘There were rooms with boxes piled high and labels still on clothing. ‘Tens of thousands of pounds of goods had never seen the outside of the box. They had just been bought and stored.’ Sentencing Saxelby yesterday, Judge Toby Hooper QC said she had displayed a strong ‘psychological compulsion to acquire goods you didn’t even want, let alone use’. He said he had no option but to jail her for two years because she had breached her employers’ trust. The court heard Saxelby, 49, who was on a salary of £14,500 a year, had a sideline as an eBay trader. A charge relating to the use of her employer’s accounts to pay the postage costs of goods she sold online was ordered to lie on file. Mr Wallace told the court she had free rein to manage the finances of the brothers’ farming business, JS and SA Hawkins in Withington, Herefordshire, an arable and dairy business that also supplied trees and plants to garden centres. The prosecutor said a large number of . cheques were made out to cash during the five-and-a-half-year fraud. He . said financial records showed how within minutes of a cheque being . cashed, money was paid into her account. ‘How the bank never raised an eyebrow is a question that needs to be asked,’ he added. The mother of two (pictured left, and right outside Hereford Crown Court) spent the cash at a range of shops . Hereford Crown Court heard some of the money was paid straight to Marks & Spencer and Laura Ashley to clear store card debts. While Saxelby boasted on Facebook about her shopping expeditions, her employers were worrying about an overdraft that had shot up from £23,000 to £150,000. They even sold off the dairy side of the business, believing it was losing them money. James Hawkins finally realised Saxelby might be at fault when he became suspicious that her marriage break-up appeared not to have hit her finances. Mr Hawkins then discovered rent money was missing and called in an accountant. Saxelby, from Ledbury, Herefordshire, admitted two counts of theft and single counts of fraud and false accounting, between September 2005 and March 2011. Two further charges were ordered to lie on the file. Adam Western, defending, said a psychologist had described her as a ‘compulsive buyer’. Saxelby, who worked for the Hawkins family for 16 years, admitted the offences on the basis that the fraud amounted to no more than £289,770, although the prosecution believes the true figure to be £51,000 higher. A friend of the Hawkins family said: ‘She was still driving around in a rubbish car and hadn’t paid off her debts or mortgage. But she was always in new clothes and did all her food shopping at Marks & Spencer. ‘She was buying pricey wine, expensive smoked salmon – everything. No one understood where she had got the money. ‘She would go around in a new pair of boots and say they were a bargain on eBay, but they were designer.’","Nicola Saxelby duped employers into signing cheques made out to her .

Refused: Edith de Lisle requested permission to disinter her parents ashes from St. John the Baptist Churchyard, Hungarton, Leicesterershire, near the family's Quenby Hall estate but was refused . When aristocrat Edith de Lisle had her parents’ remains interred in St. John the Baptist Churchyard, she thought nearby Quenby Hall estate would remain as the family seat for decades to come. Unfortunately for Mrs de Lisle the collapse of the family cheese-making business, run from the 1,135 acre estate, left the family with little option but to put the 11-bedroom hall and estate on the market, for £11m. But while the family may soon be relocating, the remains of Madam de Lisle’s parents, Frederick and Eva Krarup will not be, after the Church of England refused her permission to disinter their ashes and move them to the family burial ground 25 miles away. A senior church court said allowing disinterment on the grounds of a family moving house would make ‘unacceptable inroads into the principle of permanence of Christian burial’. They were buried at the churchyard in Hungarton, Leicestershire, less than a mile from the Jacobean Quenby Hall, after her mother died in 1995. Mrs Krarup had been cremated in Madrid before her ashes were returned to England. Her daughter had previously won the right to have her father’s ashes exhumed from his original burial site in Peru in order that her parents could be reunited in death. Madam de Lisle wanted their ashes moved to the family burial ground at Mount St Bernard Abbey, near Whitwick, Leicestershire. But in a written Consistory Court judgement, Chancellor Mark Blackett-Ord ruled she could not exhume her parents’ remains. Selling up: The family have put the nearby Quenby hall estate on the market for £11million after the family-owned cheese-making business closed . In his judgement, he said Mr and Mrs Krarup’s remains had been ‘buried with care and consideration by Madam de Lisle in the consecrated churchyard where they now lie’. Chancellor Blackett-Ord said: ‘Indeed, she must have gone to very considerable lengths to procure their removal to Hungarton from Peru and Spain. ‘What has really changed is the unfortunate probability that Quenby Hall will not survive as the centre of the lives of her descendants. ‘I have to say I consider this is a bad reason for justifying the removal of the ashes.’ He said it had been previously established that allowing disinterment on the grounds of a family moving house would make ‘unacceptable inroads into the principle of permanence of Christian burial’. Built in 1627, Quenby Hall is considered the finest High Jacobean country house in Leicestershire. Stilton cheese was first made at the hall – by the housekeeper – in the mid-18th century and the product was sold by her daughter who lived at the staging inn at Stilton, near Peterborough. Unacceptable: A senior church court said allowing disinterment on the grounds of a family moving house would make 'unacceptable inroads into the principle of permanence of Christian burial' Cheesemaking was revived at the Hall, which boasts seven reception rooms, a traditional courtyard and seven additional houses or cottages as well as four flats and associated farm buildings, by Madam de Lisle’s son, Freddie, 55, in 2005. Production resumed at the estate in . one of only six dairies licenced to produce the ‘King of Cheeses’, but . the business closed down six years later owing to cash-flow difficulties . through over-expansion. It went into administration in April 2011 after a buyer could not be found. In . his written judgement Chancellor Blackett-Ord added: ‘Unfortunately, . Frederick’s business at Quenby Hall was unsuccessful and the hall will . have to be sold. It is clear this has been a great shock to the family. ‘Madam . de Lisle stated (in correspondence before the ruling) ‘the family will . have to be uprooted from what they had come to view as their home for . generations to come’.’ He expressed regret, but refused Madam de Lisle’s application. Cheese: The Stilton cheese produced by Madam de Lisle's son, Freddie, 55, left. The business was forced to close down however due to cash-flow problems . Freddie de Lisle, who lives with wife Aubyn, 54, at the hall, said he could not comment on the ruling, or whether the sale of Quenby Hall was related to the liquidation of the dairy company. An estate worker said he currently works as a headhunter, based in London. His parents, Squire Gerard de Lisle, 72,and Madam de Lisle, 74, who live in a lodge house on the estate, were said to be abroad on holiday. The Squire de Lisle bought Quenby in the early 1970s, to replace the family seat at Garendon Hall, near Loughborough, Leicestershire, which was demolished in 1964. The property has been extensively restored and is a popular wedding venue, as well as location for feature films and period dramas. The de Lisle family of Leicestershire were originally the Phillipps from London. In 1684, Sir Ambrose Phillipps spent some of his fortune acquired through his legal practice and place at court to buy Garendon for £28,000. When his grandson, another Ambrose, died aged in 1737 aged just 30, the estate fell to his brother, Samuel, who later died without children. Garendon passed to a cousin, Thomas March, who adopted the name Phillipps, then married Susan de Lisle. Their son, Charles, adopted the de Lisle crest and when he died in 1862, his son, another Ambrose, decided to adopt all the previous family names, becoming the impressively named Ambrose Charles Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle.","Quenby Hall estate put on market for £11million after family business failed .

These are the first pictures of Simon Huxtable and  Deborah Dale, the British couple crushed by a drunk driver in Bruges. The pair had been taking a stroll on New Year’s Day when they were hit by a speeding  Mercedes going the wrong way down a one-way street. Miss Dale, 34, and Mr Huxtable, 44, were badly injured when the car pinned them to a wall, crushing their legs. Injured: Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were crushed by a car while on a romantic holiday in Bruges . The couple, from Witney, Oxfordshire, were in the city for a romantic New Year break, and had been staying in the heart of Old Bruges. They remain in the city’s Sint Jan Hospital, where doctors are fighting to save their legs. A source close to Miss Dale’s family yesterday corrected a statement by Belgian police, who said medics had been forced to amputate both her legs in an emergency operation. The source told the Daily Mail: ‘Miss Dale has been seriously injured but doctors have not had to amputate her legs. ‘She has suffered serious injuries and she is continuing to receive treatment for these injuries in hospital.’ The original police statement said: ‘The woman had to have both of her legs amputated. ‘The man also suffered bad injuries. One of his legs was very badly injured but doctors have been working to save them.’ The couple’s parents rushed to Belgium after learning of the accident, and remain at their hospital bedsides. Foreign Office officials also are providing assistance. Scene of horror: The Mercedes stands in the cobbled street where Deborah Dale and Simon Huxtable were crushed . Mr Huxtable, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had travelled to the historic Belgian city for a romantic New Year break with Miss Dale . 'There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’ The driver, a 22-year-old local man . who has not been identified, had been at an all-night New Year’s Eve . party in the city centre before the accident, which happened at 10.30am. He failed to stop the Mercedes C320 . saloon at a T-junction and ploughed straight into the couple, who were . walking along the cobbled streets past historic Flemish houses in the . Old Town. The heavy car pinned the couple against the wall of a house, causing horrific crush injuries. The driver, who police believe had . been speeding, was breathalysed at the scene and arrested for driving . while over the alcohol limit. He was banned from driving for 15 days . and released without further sanction. A magistrate will decide in the . coming months whether to bring any further charges. Last night Miss Dale’s ex-partner Kevin Ruxton branded the Belgian criminal justice system ‘disgusting’. Mr Ruxton, a computer engineer from . West London, said: ‘It’s up to a judge to decide if this drunk . 22-year-old gets any kind of sentence, I think that is preposterous. It . seems too lenient.’ He added: ‘They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We are still in shock.’ Yesterday a spokesman for the Belgian . police said the couple remained in a serious condition. ‘There is a . possibility that they may both have to have either one or even both legs . amputated,’ he added. Sister . Emmanuelle, a Catholic nun who witnessed the horrific scene, said: ‘I . heard a big bang and then I heard loud screaming. There were two people . lying on the ground screaming and waving their arms wildly. It was . terrible. ‘The people were screaming and screaming and shouting out in English. I tried to reassure them but I cannot speak English. ‘The driver got out of the car and asked . someone to call an ambulance. People were coming out of their houses . because of the noise . ‘Finally the injured people fell silent and stopped screaming. After what seemed like a long time the police and the ambulance arrived. ‘I have not been able to sleep since. I can still hear them screaming.' A retired doctor, who lives next to the crash site, administered first aid on the couple while they waited for the ambulance. Witness Marleen Broeckeart said: ‘There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’ Horrific: Witnesses to the crash said that they heard screaming while a retired doctor who lived nearby administered first aid . A police spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘The driver is a local man. He had borrowed his sister’s car to come to Bruges for a New Year’s Eve party. ‘The next day he was driving the wrong way along a small street in the centre of Bruges. ‘He was meant to turn at a T-junction but he went straight on and drove into the British tourists who were walking along the footpath. 'The Mercedes is a very heavy car and it pinned them against the front of a house and they were badly hurt. ‘The driver said he had been drinking and officers found he was over the legal limit. ‘He was arrested and he was banned from driving for 15 days, which is the normal procedure. A magistrate will decide in the next couple of months if there will be any further charges.’ Popular: The historic city of Bruges attracts thousands of British tourists every year . Miss Dale’s parents, Roger and Diana, were at their daughter’s bedside at the Sint Jan Hospital in Bruges. A hospital spokesman said: ‘They are very upset. They don’t want to talk about what has happened to their daughter. It is against hospital policy to discuss the medical condition of patients with journalists.’ Bruges, which dates from the 12th century and is a UNESCO world heritage site, is a popular holiday destination attracting tens of thousands of Britons every year. The small Old Town is characterised by its winding cobbled streets, meandering canals and pretty squares surrounded by distinct Flemish red-brick houses. However behind the picturesque architecture is a rich commercial history – Bruges was an important trading centre throughout the Middle Ages.","Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were crushed while out walking .

If you gave the dustmen a hefty tip this Christmas because you feel guilty about the amount of rubbish you put out, you might want  to take a leaf out of John Newson’s book. Yesterday he celebrated achieving his goal of producing only one bag of refuse in an entire year. Mr Newson has picked through his leftovers every day since last New Year’s Day, putting all his uneaten food on a compost heap in his garden. He does not eat meat or fish,  and he grows his own salad and fruit to cut down on supermarket packaging. Proud recycler John Newson with his only bag of rubbish in 2012, after he resolved to recycle or compost most of his waste . The 60-year-old also separates out . his cardboard, paper, plastic bottles, glass and cans for weekly . kerbside collections by the council – and because those items can then . be recycled, they don’t count towards his annual rubbish tally. He even travels from his home in . Balsall Heath, Birmingham, to Bristol and London to recycle margarine . tubs and Tetra Pak juice cartons because he believes those cities have . better recycling facilities. The single bin bag he has been left . with after 365 days of living as possibly the greenest householder in . Britain is full of plastic film  packaging which he cannot recycle and . has been unable to find a use for in his home. Mr Newson, who works as a . self-employed environmental re-searcher, said yesterday: ‘People ask, . “Why on earth are you doing this?” Back to the earth: John's resolution to compost waste meant that he was able to fill just one bag of rubbish for the year . Reaping the benefits: Through careful recycling and composting, John has been able to grow his own fruit. The 60-year-old says he understand it would be harder for larger households, but says Britain could improve its recycling habits . John says far too many plastic bags are being wasted in Britain . ‘I just wondered, if you compost . absolutely everything that will rot and recycle everything you can, what . will you be left with? ‘I wanted to push myself to an . extreme to see how far I could  go. If you had six children and  lots of . disposable nappies it would be different. ‘But I’m not doing this to score . points off any other household in Birmingham, I’m just asking what could . we feasibly get our recycling rate up to. I’d say that 80 to 90 per . cent of all waste can be composted or recycled. At the moment in Britain . it’s about 30 per cent. ‘There are 52 weeks in the year and . 400,000 households across Birmingham, so that’s 20million plastic bin . bags that are being  produced, distributed, collected and burned each . year.’ He added: ‘Recycling some things is . not that easy in Birmingham. I’ve taken some things, like drink cartons, . to the recycling centre but there’s a difference between what’s . possible and what’s convenient.’ Birmingham’s recycling rate of 31.5 . per cent puts it in the bottom quarter of councils nationwide in terms . of recycling and waste management.

Dickon Young, 48, was discovered by a neighbour at around 3.40pm in the village where the former set designer lived with his mother, now 73. Last night, residents in Long Marston, near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, told how he had suffered mental health problems following a car crash some years ago. Together: Dickon Young, 48, pictured beside his mother actress Kate O'Mara. Mr Young was found dead in the house he shared with his mother in Long Marston, Warwickshire on New Year's Eve . Dickon Young was found dead in a garage near his home (pictured) by a neighbour on New Year's Day . The mother and son had lived in the village – famous for its airfield which plays host to summer music festivals – for around a year. It is understood a next-door neighbour discovered Dickon’s body on Monday afternoon, although it remained unclear last night who owned the garage where he was found. David Marcuse, a warden at the village’s St James Church, said: ‘I don’t think Dickon was very well. Smiling: Kate O'Mara and son Dickon Young are thought to have lived together in the village for around a year. Mr Young was reported to have suffered mental health problems following a car crash . ‘He had a car accident some years ago and his mind was never the same, as I understand it. I think he suffered from periods of depression. ‘Physically he seemed fine. He didn’t leave the house very often, but I used to see him occasionally walking through the village. ‘It is a tragic situation all round and everybody’s thoughts will be with the family.’ One villager, who did not want to be named, said: 'Kate has not been well herself recently but I am told that she is, quite understandably, beyond distraught by Dickon's death. 'Police were called and he was found with a rope around his neck. The family are considering it a suicide. 'They [Kate and Dickon] were very close and she doted on him, especially since he suffered what appeared to be something of a mental breakdown in recent years. 'Despite only living here a relatively short time, Kate has become a genuinely well-liked member of the community and we are all deeply saddened by her loss.'

'I think he suffered from periods of depression. 'Physically he seemed fine. He didn't leave the house very often, but I used to see him occasionally walking through the village. 'It is a tragic situation all round and everybody's thoughts will be with the family.' Twice-divorced Miss O’Mara moved to the property with her son around a year ago. She remains best known for her role as Caress Morell, the scheming sister of Joan Collins’ Alexis Colby in Dynasty, but has also starred in a number of hit TV shows including Doctor Who, Howards’ Way and Absolutely Fabulous, as well as establishing her own theatre company. Last spring, she starred in the Agatha Christie Theatre Company’s production of Murder on the Nile at the Malvern Theatre in Worcestershire. In the mid-1980s, at the age of 22 while working in a London theatre, Dickon enjoyed a well-publicised affair with actress Jenny Agutter, who was ten years his senior.

Shakespeare Company, and ran his own set-building company in Los . Angeles, specialising in suspended scenery, before settling up his own . company building treehouses in the mid-1990s. By . 2002, Dickon was once more involved in the theatre, working as a set . designer on his mother’s company’s production of The Rivals at . Birmingham’s Alexandra Theatre. The production featured Miss O’Mara in a . supporting role. Dickon, whose father is the actor Jeremy Young, is not thought to have been working recently. Following their divorce, Miss O’Mara gave birth to another son, but when his father left, she made the agonising decision to have the child adopted. The boy, Chris Linde, contacted her decades later but the pair did not get on. He later branded Miss O’Mara an ‘uncaring mother’ in a series of bitter attacks in the Press. Miss O’Mara married second husband, Richard Willis, in 1993. They divorced three years later.

The Canadian man who sold military secrets to Russia apologized to his country and some of his family in a court sentencing hearing Friday. But he didn’t apologize to his wife. Sorry spy: Former Canadian navy sub-Lieutenant Jeffrey Paul Delisle sold Canadian government secrets to the Russians and apologized to his children and parents in a sentencing hearing Jan. 31. Former Canadian navy Sub-Lieutenant Jeffrey Paul Delisle apologized to his children and parents in Halifax haring where prosecutors asked for at least a 25 year sentence. 'I’m sorry for the hurt and the pain that I caused them,” he said. 'It’s the same for my friends and colleagues.' However, he’s not sorry to his wife. According to CTV, it was her infidelity that Delisle blamed for the emotional distress that led to his committing ‘professional suicide.’ Lawyer vs. lawyer: Delisle's defense lawyer Mike Tayler (left) urged the court to give a lighter sentence for crimes the defense says caused Canada little harm. Meanwhile, crown attorney Lyne Decarie pushed for at least twenty-five years in prison, saying Delisle caused 'exceptionally grave damage' to Canada . ‘My wife, that I loved for so long, killed me,’ the 41-year-old said in an interrogation video that was played in the sentencing hearing. ‘And the pain of her betrayal and the pain she put my children through killed me.’ Spurned spy: In an interrogation video played in his sentencing hearing, Delisle said his wife's infidelity caused him to commit 'professional suicide' by selling Canadian government secrets to Russia . In 2007, Delisle entered a Russian Embassy in Ottowa and offered his services as a spy. For the next five years, Delisle mined data available to him in his position in the Canadian navy. At his disposal was sensitive information from Australia, U.K., New Sealand, and the U.S. as well as from Canada. In fact, Canadian authorities neglected to uncover Delisle’s doings themselves. American officials had to first tip the country off. Delisle received over $100,000 from Russian agents while working as a spy. He copied data from government computers while working at the navy’s intelligence and communications center and then shared it with a Russian agent through a shared email account. Prosecutors argued Delisle struck a damaging blow to Canada and its allies with his activities and a military official who testified agreed and said Delisle caused ‘exceptionally grave damage to Canada. Meanwhile, Delisle’s defense refutes the claim and has asked for a lower sentence of around ten years in prison. Russia’s ambassador to Canada, Georgiy Mamedov, seems to agree and said as much in an interview on CTV's Power Play. Canuck cut-down: There's not 'too much to be spied out of Canada' Russian Ambassador to Canada said in a television interview . ‘No disrespect, but I said it before – I don’t believe there’s too much to be spied out of Canada.'

A premature baby being treated at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital had a dummy taped to his mouth by a nurse to prevent him crying, it was revealed yesterday. The incident was described by experts as extremely dangerous  – the infant was struggling to breath – and the hospital has apologised to the family. A nurse has been suspended while police investigate what happened. Safe at home: Sarah Fellows with her son Mason, whose dummy was taped to his mouth . Lung condition: Sarah Fellows' premature twin boys Mason (left) and Reece in Stafford Hospital . Mason Fellows and twin Reece were born 11 weeks premature but were both doing well until Mason contracted the common childhood virus bronchiolitis and was re-admitted earlier this month. But their mother Sarah was astonished to receive a phone call from a nurse on the children’s ward, informing her that the four-month-old boy, who weighed just 8lb, had been discovered with the dummy strapped to his mouth by surgical tape. A consultant paediatrician told the Daily Mail that taping a dummy to a baby’s mouth was ‘extremely dangerous’ because of the potential to inhibit breathing. The scandal comes less than a fortnight before publication of the result of a public inquiry into failings at the notorious hospital – where up to 1,200 patients may have died ‘unnecessarily’ through poor care or neglect. Traumatic experience: Sarah Fellows holds her two baby boys after they were born 11 weeks premature . Apology: Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has apologised and a staff member has been suspended . Miss Fellows, 28, told the Daily Mail . yesterday Mason had been heavily congested when the incident happened . three nights after he was admitted to the hospital. He was discharged the following day, but . it was another 48 hours before a senior nurse called  Miss Fellows to . tell her what had happened. ‘I couldn’t believe  what I was hearing when . she explained what had gone on,’ the mother said. ‘I was tormenting myself at the thought this nurse could have continued looking after Mason despite doing what she did to him. ‘It would be considered cruel to force . a dummy into a baby’s mouth at any time, but for a nurse to do it to a . baby who was struggling to breathe through his nose was not only cruel . but also potentially dangerous. Angry: Sarah Fellows was horrified when she discovered what had happened to baby Mason in hospital . A public inquiry has been launched after it was revealed up to 1,200 patients may have died because of failings in care at Stafford Hospital . ‘I’m so angry. Mason has a weak . respiratory system because he was born premature and he could have . suffocated. He may need to go back to hospital. It terrifies me that . this nurse could be free to do this again to him or somebody else.’ The suspended nurse is said to have . admitted seeing the dummy taped to Mason’s face and failing to remove . it, but denies she was responsible for putting it there. Horrified mother Sarah Fellows was told by staff that a nurse had taped a dummy in the mouth of her son Mason who was in intensive care with breathing problems after being born 11 weeks premature . Miss Fellows, herself a trainee nurse, . said whoever put the dummy in Mason’s mouth ‘obviously couldn’t be . bothered to tend to a crying baby and just shoved the dummy in to try . and shut him up’. ‘Even after all the horror stories . surrounding Stafford Hospital, I never thought it was possible for . something like this to happen.’ The pregnancy had already proved . traumatic for Miss Fellows and partner Lee Denny, 39, before their . identical twins’ arrival at Walsall Manor Hospital on September 3, her . local hospital at the time she became pregnant. At 23 weeks, she needed emergency . surgery after it was discovered the twins were at risk because of . abnormally connected blood vessels in the shared placenta. The surgery stabilised the twins enough for them to last a further six weeks in the womb. Mason was born weighing 2lb 10oz, . while Reece was 2lb 5oz. The twins were transferred to the neo-natal . unit of Birmingham’s City Hospital, where they remained until Reece was . discharged in mid-November. Mason was discharged three weeks later, on December 1. For the next fortnight, Miss Fellows, . 28, who is now separated from Mr Denny had the twins and their two older . children Jack, five and Elysia, two, together at her home in Cannock, . Staffordshire. Then both twins fell ill with . bronchiolitis, which causes inflammation in the lungs, and were admitted . to Stafford Hospital for the first time. They were discharged on December 22 . but Mason was readmitted on New Year’s Day and was in his own room when a . senior nurse made the horrifying discovery.

Thousands of mourners gathered in front of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, today, on the eve of the cremation of former king Norodom Sihanouk. Mourners accompanied a gilded chariot carrying the body of the former king - the dominant figure of modern Cambodia - in a funeral procession on Friday to a cremation ground next to the palace where he was crowned more than 70 years ago. The cremation, the climax of seven days of mourning, will take place tomorrow, when the funeral pyre will be lit by his wife and his son King Norodom Sihamoni. Funeral: Former Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk (left) will be cremated tomorrow at a crematorium (right) close to the Royal palace in Phnom Penh . Prayers: A Cambodian boy, sitting on his father's shoulder for a better view over the crowd, pays his respects today in front of the crematorium near the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh . Crematorium: People take pictures with their mobile phones of the site where a coffin bearing the remains of Cambodia's late former king Norodom Sihanouk is placed . His body had been lying in state at the Royal Palace after being flown from Beijing where he died on October 15 of a heart attack at the age of 89. Many wept as the kilometer-long procession slowly proceeded on Friday, watched by more than half a million people, according to an estimate by city spokesman Long Dimanche. Most knelt and clasped their hands in prayer as the cortege passed while Buddhist monks chanted. 'Since I was born, I have seen him doing everything for the country and people,' said Un Veth, 74. 'Today is the last day. In the future I can only see him in photographs.' Chan Virak, a 24-year-old student called the former king, 'a great leader, the symbol of peace and prosperity for Cambodia.' Mourners: The cremation will take place tomorrow when the funeral pyre will be lit by his wife and his son King Norodom Sihamoni. Cremation: Thousands gathered today outside the Royal Palace to mourn the former king's passing . Respects: Mourners offer prayers to the late former Cambodian King . Candles: Thousands of mourners offer prayers by the streets surrounding the cremation site for the former king . In a turbulent lifetime, Sihanouk wrested independence from the French colonials and managed to initially keep his small country out of the Vietnam War by adroitly playing off the United States against the Communist world. But a 1970 coup engulfed Cambodia in the conflict and precipitated the Khmer Rouge reign of terror. A consummate survivor and political opportunist, Sihanouk was imprisoned by the Khmer Rouge, and after their fall in 1979 went on to lead an insurgency against the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia. Offering: A man lights a candle as an offering to mourn the late former Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk . Scene: Mourners look at the cremation site for the late former Cambodian King . Crowds: Thousands gather outside the Royal Palace on the eve of the cremation . After a peace deal he helped broker, Sihanouk return to Phnom Penh but abdicated in 2004 in favor of his son King Norodom Sihamoni, a ballet dancer educated in Europe. Sihamoni and his mother, Norodom Monineath, followed the seven-foot-high casket with Sihanouk's body as it was moved from the palace past a line of officials on Friday. The former queen wept quietly. The casket was laid beneath a temple-like structure on one of several funeral chariots and accompanied by court Brahmins and women dressed as Apsaras, the celestial dancers of Cambodian mythology. Marching with the procession were courtiers dressed in pantaloons and spiked helmets, bearing five-tiered umbrellas and other royal regalia.

Embrace: The cranes lean their heads back to touch each other as part of the graceful courtship dance . These beautiful cranes prove that two heads are better than one with this graceful courtship dance. The long-legged lovers kept warm in sub-zero temperatures by performing the coy ballet-like routine. They strutted around in the snow and flapped their black wings at each other, then leant their heads back in a touching embrace. Photographer Takaaki Ishikawa, 55, enjoyed watching the majestic red-crowned cranes' afternoon display. This pair's eye-catching plumage caught his attention in a 50-strong group who had flocked to the spot on the Japanese island of Hokkaido to feed. Mr Ishikawa said: 'This final head-touch is one of the gestures of courtship. 'They only attached heads for a few seconds, but there was a warning about 30 seconds before it happened. 'After reaching their necks up and nearly touching beaks, they then went back to the dance of courtship. 'When it was over, they snuggled together for a while and then took off with the rest of their group to find a place to sleep.' The birds also made their signature trumpet-like cry as they danced.

Villagers campaigning against an illegal gipsy site on green belt land opposite their homes marked the 1,000th day of their round-the-clock protest camp yesterday. The hardy band, many in their seventies, have huddled under a tarpaulin with little more than a fire for comfort every day and night since the Romany gipsies arrived in May 2010. The gipsies bought the eight-acre paddock in Meriden, West Midlands, for £100,000 but were stopped from laying hardcore when villagers formed a human chain to turn away their diggers. Villagers campaigning against an illegal gypsy camp on greenbelt land mark 1,000 days of their blockade of the site. Supporters Maz Crawley, Maureen Taylor and Ken Hughes are pictured . Maureen Taylor changes the tally to say 'Day 1000' to mark a defining moment in the 24 hour vigil . Since then around 200 members of . Residents Against Inappropriate Development have braved storms, floods, . snow and torrential rain to make sure there is no further development. Last night, as temperatures dipped towards minus 5C (23F), the group marked the 1,000-day milestone with a warming curry. The 'Meriden gypsies' paid a local businessman £100,000 for the paddock and moved onto it over the May Day Bank Holiday in 2010 when the council were powerless to stop them. Since the move, the determination of villagers to preserve the Meriden Gap greenbelt which separates the village from Coventry and Solihull has been relentless. Residents descended on the eight-acre plot and formed a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of hardcore rubble to the site later that evening. Ever since, around 200 residents have manned their camp around the clock to make sure the site is not developed any further, working to a rota with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight. The determined residents even had Christmas dinner in their protest camp in case the travellers again tried to develop the site any further. The caravans at the illegal gypsy encampment in leafy Eaves Green Lane, Meriden, Warwickshire . The 250 members of RAID, Residents Against Inappropriate Development, have been defiant against the site, pictured . The snow-covered development where gypsy families are living. There are old and disabled people living in caravans on the plot of land . The entrance to the site which the caravan owners have been told they must leave by March 31 in a High Court order . But the residents did not have planning permission for the camp - which stands on a builders' yard driveway immediately opposite the gypsy settlement - and, last February, the Tory-run authority voted to issue an enforcement against it. A month later the travellers at the site lost a High Court battle and now have to leave the site by March 31 this year. David McGrath, chairman of RAID, said ‘We have been here in temperatures of minus 17 and we will continue.’ He said that the gypsies now keep a 'caretaker presence' returning only during the day to deal scrap metal. Local protesters are pictured outside the plot of land in the West Midlands on May 2 2010 after gypsys moved into the site over the weekend . Enjoying a cuppa: Three campaigners are stood in the cold as they protest against the site . He said: 'They aren't there at night, there aren't many people there at all, they just keep a caretaker presence. 'Some of them come here every day to deal scrap metal but they don't live on the site. 'None of them are local people, they came from all over the place as part of this scheme, it's just about land value, if they can get planning permission they make a £100,000 piece of field worth millions. 'It's not about need, it's about greed. Determined: The villagers will not celebrate nor will they go home until the gypsys have moved . The estimated 200 villagers are aged between 60 and 90 and say they have survived the floods and snow . A makeshift tent was erected by the villages nearby the gypsy camp but council bosses ruled they had no right to be there . 'We aren't celebrating the 1,000 days here, we will be marking it, we won't celebrate anything until they are gone and the land returned to the former state. 'There is an order for them to leave the site in March and within a month return the site to greenbelt land. 'But they say they aren't leaving, it will be up to the council to make sure it doesn't turn into another Dale Farm. 'We have survived freezing conditions, snow and even floods, you can't drive to the site now because of the snow. 'But we won't leave until the site returns to it's former state from the muddy mess it is now.' But despite the deadline for their . eviction being just nine weeks away, the defiant gypsies today stuck two . fingers up at the planning process - and vowed 'we will not be moved.' Noah Burton, spokesman for the travellers, said: 'We are living in mud and s***, Where are we going to go . 'What are they going to do with us? Are they going to take us to the gas chambers? It didn't work for Hitler. 'They [the villagers] are the biggest hypocrites on the planet. It's all about the value of their homes. 'We have old people, we have disabled people. 'If . any other ethnic group of people had to live in these conditions there . would be uproar. It would not be allowed, but gypsies are easy targets. 'For . 18 months I have bombarded Solihull Council asking for somewhere to go. There is nowhere. How are you going to resolve this? 'If . the council find us somewhere else to go then we will go, how are we . supposed to find somewhere to go if they can't with all their massive . resources?

Mariano Batalla said that Zavala said he couldn't attend a friend's birthday party because 'he had to do something important'. Mr Batalla said he returned from the . party around midnight and repeatedly tried to call Zavala, who never . answered his phone. Zavala's truck remained parked in their driveway.

In the note, Zavala told the 19-year-old that he was a good son and to take care of himself, Immler said. The bag also contained a second gun, extra ammunition, duct tape and cutting shears. A second note was found at Isidro Zavala's home, but police did not release its contents. Batalla said that the second note was addressed to him.

The identities of 80 dead children were stolen by the police and used to create fake passports, it has been revealed. The names and dates of birth were taken without the knowledge of the children’s parents and used by officers infiltrating protest groups. For 30 years, detectives from Scotland Yard trawled through national birth and death records looking for suitable identities. They used the birth certificates to apply for a variety of identity documents to make their aliases appear genuine. John Dines, an undercover police sergeant, as he apeared in the early 1980s when he posed as John Barker, a protester against capitalism . In some cases officers spent up to ten years in the same guise. One, John Dines, adopted the identity of an eight-year-old boy called John Barker, who died in 1968 from leukaemia. Another officer said he felt he was ‘stomping on the grave’ of the four-year-old boy whose identity he used while working undercover in anti-racist groups. And a third detective spent years living under the identity of a child who died in a car crash. Under cover officers using assumed identities also formed sexual relationships with targets in groups they had infiltrated in the 1980s, which included environmental and anti-racist groups. Lord Ken Macdonald, former Director . of Public Prosecutions, has condemned the practice and called for a public inquiry - warning that unacceptable . practices might still be in use today. He said it was 'really worrying' that police chiefs appeared not to have . entirely ruled out a repeat of recently-exposed cases of officers . entering sexual relationships with targets. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, he said: 'How are you supposed to maintain a level of fair and objective . evidence-gathering if you are having sex with the person you are . targeting, fathering a baby and then abandoning it, using a dead child's . identity?' 'These are all examples of areas in which the police have completely . lost their moral compass and have completely failed to understand the . boundaries. 'We don't know quite how these units were operating in days gone by. It . looks as though they've effectively gone rogue. I am not at all clear . how high up in Scotland Yard these sorts of operations were being . organised. He added: 'What we really need is a public inquiry into undercover . policing which takes evidence, takes advice, sets out some guidelines, . sets out some mechanisms so we can be confident these sorts of . procedures are not being followed today. 'We need to know how we got there, where we are now and we need to be . reassured that this sort of behaviour won't occur in the future and I . think an inquiry is really the only way to achieve that. 'I do think the Government will think seriously about this because these sorts of stories seem to be endless. 'It is drip, drip, drip, it is corrosive, it is seedy and I think we . really need to find ourselves in a position where we can reassure the . public that this sort of behaviour is not going to carry on.' After initial protestations that undercover officers getting sexually . involved with targets could no longer happen, there appeared to have . been a 'subtle shift in which it is being suggested that it could be . appropriate in some circumstances'. 'This is a deeply ethical issue which the police have to grapple with,' he said. Police were inspired by the film, The Day of the Jackal . Peter Bleksley, a former under cover . detective for the Metropolitan Police, said: 'In the undercover unit of . which I was a director, we . were completely dedicated to combatting serious and organised crime. 'We . had nothing to do with protest groups or environmental campaigns. 'The state gave us a fake identities we required; passports, driving licences, or credit cards. 'We would never dream of using a dead . child's identity, I cannot comprehend why anyone would want to adopt an . identity rather than create one. 'These people were largely staffed . with people who didn't have detective experience, clearly the management . was lacking in experience and authority. 'In our unit we always had clear end . games, to take the drugs, stolen commodities or to prevent murder. It . seems these units had no clear goals or end games. It's a recipe for . disaster.' The technique of using dead children . as aliases was borrowed from Frederick  Forsyth’s novel, The Day of the . Jackal. Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the home affairs select committee, . said he was shocked by the ‘gruesome’ practice. ‘It . will only cause enormous distress to families who will discover what . has happened concerning the identities of their dead children,’ he said. ‘This is absolutely shocking. My disbelief at some of the tactics used . has become shock as a result of these latest revelations. ‘It is clear that inappropriate action has been taken by undercover police in the past. But this has taken it to a new level.’ The practice was introduced 40 years ago by police to lend credibility to the back stories of covert operatives spying on protesters. It also guarded against the possibility that campaigners would discover their true identities. Since then dozens of officers, including those who posed as anti-capitalists, animal rights activists and violent far-right campaigners, have used the identities of dead children. One document appeared to suggest around 80 officers from a secret unit called the Special Demonstration Squad used such identities between 1968 and 1994. The total number could be higher. An officer who adopted the identity of four-year-old Pete Black compared the methods used by Scotland Yard to those of the Stasi – the secret police in the former East Germany. ‘A part of me was thinking about how I would feel if someone was taking the names and details of my dead son,’ he said. ‘I used to get this really odd feeling.’ The officer said he always felt guilty when celebrating the birthday of the four-year-old whose identity he took. He was particularly aware that somewhere the parents of the boy would be ‘thinking about their son and missing him’. To fully immerse himself in the adopted identity and appear convincing when speaking about his upbringing, Mr Black visited the child’s home town to familiarise himself with the surroundings. Black, who was under cover in the 1990s, said SDS officers visited the house they were supposed to have been born in so they would have a memory of the building. ‘It’s those little details that really matter – the weird smell coming out of the drain that’s been broken for years, the location of the post office, the number of the bus,’ he told the Guardian newspaper. Fifteen separate inquiries have already been launched since 2011, when Mark Kennedy was unmasked as a police spy who had slept with several women, including one who was his girlfriend for six years, during his time under cover. Scotland Yard said the practice was not currently authorised, but announced an investigation into ‘past arrangements for undercover identities used by SDS officers’.","Details were taken so officers could infiltrate protest groups .

Tory divisions over plans to allow same-sex marriage took an extraordinary turn yesterday when a leading gay Conservative said MPs who are secretly homosexual will vote against the legislation tomorrow. Iain Dale even claimed that two married MPs who are opposing gay unions are secretly cheating on their wives with other men. The talk radio host and former Tory Parliamentary candidate warned that the issue has become so divisive that around 12 Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem MPs risk being ‘outed’ if they vote against the plans. Extraordinary claim: A leading gay conservative said MPs who are secretly homosexual will vote against the legislation tomorrow . The claims electrified an already bitter fight over David Cameron’s proposals, which are set to see more than half of Tory MPs oppose the Prime Minister’s stance in the Commons tomorrow. Downing Street expects 120 Tory MPs to vote No, with another 60 abstentions – a bitter blow to Mr Cameron who has pushed through the plans in the face of widespread opposition from his party. Tory Cabinet ministers Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, and Welsh Secretary David Jones are expected to vote No, while others are set to dodge the vote. The new Archbishop of Canterbury is ready to challenge government plans for gay weddings, insisting marriage should be between a man and a woman. The Rt Rev Justin Welby, who is being formally confirmed in his new role at a ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral today, is prepared to face questions about the highly divisive issue. ‘He will say that marriage is between a man and a woman, and always has been,’ a source told the Daily Telegraph. Lambeth Palace was keen to stress the view was standard Church of England policy and insisted the Archbishop was not planning to wade into the row by making any formal statements, but was simply ready to respond to any questions he was asked on the issue. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, a known opponent of gay marriage, will be overseas, although aides say the trip was long planned. Allies of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith say he has not made up his mind, but could now back the plans out of loyalty to Mr Cameron. But with the party divided down the middle, Mr Dale issued the incendiary allegation that some MPs risk a charge of hypocrisy if they oppose the plans. Having studied a list of those . expected to vote No drawn up by pro-gay marriage group the Coalition for . Equal Marriage, he wrote: ‘I note with interest the names of several . MPs who most people in the Westminster Village know to be closet case . gays. ‘And I note also the names of two supposedly straight MPs who I know to be conducting gay affairs at the moment.’ Mr . Dale, who helped run David Davis’s Tory leadership campaign in 2005, . emphasised: ‘I don’t believe in ‘‘outing’’ anyone.’ But he warned: . ‘Because of the rank hypocrisy there will be others who will take a . different view. 'How is it possible to be married yourself, and yet at . the same time vote to deny that privilege to someone whose pants you . have just pulled down?’ With . feelings running high, 25 serving and former Conservative constituency . chairmen yesterday delivered a letter to Downing Street accusing the PM . of ‘bulldozing through’ the reforms and warning they could cost him . victory in 2015. The grassroots leaders say the . decision to promote the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill ‘has been made . without adequate debate or consultation with either the membership of . the Conservative Party or with the country at large’. The . letter argues that Mr Cameron has ‘no mandate’ for the change and has . pressed his case ‘in a manner which a significant proportion of . Conservative Party members find extremely distasteful and contrary to . the principles of both the party and the best traditions of our . democracy’. But Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley dismissed the significance of the letter, claiming arguments against gay marriage 'don't add up'. Twenty-five past and present officers went to Downing Street. Twenty-five out of 2,000, 3,000 does not strike me as being newsworthy,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'When it was first proposed I was indifferent. Then a bunch of people started arguments against it. I started looking at those arguments; they don't add up. 'Conservatives believe in fairness. We now understand that to move from a civil partnership to a civil marriage is to allow the words ""I will"" at the ceremony. That is not going to be a big deal.' Iain Dale has been in civil partnership since 2008 . Iain Dale is one of the most prominent gay Tories and a well-known figure at Westminster.The talk show host is a presenter with LBC, the London radio station that hosts Nick Clegg’s weekly phone-in show. He ran for the seat of North Norfolk in 2005, losing to Lib Dem care minister Norman Lamb. Mr Dale was the first Tory candidate ever to be chosen for a seat after announcing before the selection meeting that he was gay. The former proprietor of the Politicos bookshop in Westminster, he founded Total Politics magazine and is managing director of publisher Biteback, which specialises in politicians’ memoirs.  It also published Tory Pride and Prejudice, a history of the Conservative Party’s approach to gay rights legislation. Mr Dale has been in a relationship with publishing finance expert John Simmons for 17 years, and in a civil partnership since 2008. He says they haven’t discussed whether to marry if the law is changed. In a further blow for the Prime Minister, . a ComRes poll suggests that six out of ten ethnic minority voters – who . Mr Cameron is wooing to win the next election – believe marriage should . only be between a man and a woman. Some 49 per cent believe those who . support traditional marriage will be persecuted at work for their views. Protection: Michael Gove insisted teachers would not face the sack for supporting gay marriage in schools . The Coalition for Marriage, which opposes plans to redefine traditional marriage, released figures showing that 40,000 teachers might face the sack for failing to support gay marriage in schools. Education Secretary Michael Gove – a supporter of same-sex weddings – insisted that they would be protected. ‘I have complete confidence in the protection our law offers freedom of conscience and speech,’ he said. ‘There is a significant difference between expecting a teacher to explain something and requiring them to promote it.’ But a legal opinion, seen by the Mail, written by John Bowers QC says that teachers would have to promote gay marriage. He said the Bill ‘provides no exception for conscientious beliefs. There would be a duty on the teacher to promote marriage as newly defined’. One source said Mr Gove was ‘privately more concerned than he is letting on’. A report published today by Tory think tank Respublica argues that the Bill ‘fundamentally undermines the meaning of marriage’ and should be scrapped, with churches encouraged to bless civil partnerships instead. Author Philip Blond said: ‘The primary purpose of conjugal marriage is to provide a stable environment for raising children – this purpose would be completely lost by the proposed redefinition.’ The report will be introduced by ministerial aide David Burrowes, who yesterday claimed that he has received death threats as a result of his opposition to gay marriage. ÷ France is set to approve a gay marriage law that would see the words ‘mother’ and ‘father’ banned from all official documents in favour of ‘parents’.

Bank customers will be given more powers to demand a better deal under plans unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne today. People will be able to switch accounts in just a week if they find a better deal elsewhere. And the time it takes to transfer money and clear cheques will also be cut as Mr Osborne vowed to take on the 'oligopoly' of a handful of banking giants dominating the market. Scroll down for video . Bailing out: George Osborne used a speech at the JP Morgan offices in Bournemouth to say he would let reckless banks go to the wall . In what amounts to the biggest shakeup . of the banking industry in decades, he also threatened to forcibly break . up banks that break the rules. Reckless banks will be allowed to go to the wall so taxpayers never have to bail them out again. In a speech at the Bournemouth offices of JP Morgan, Mr Osborne said 2013 will be the year when the banking system is 'reset'. He said he wanted to see banks 'working for their customers, not themselves' as he set out the Government's Banking Reform Bill. The Chancellor promised to make it easier to switch accounts in just a week, and in future it should be quicker to transfer money and clear a cheque . In a bid to promote better . competition between banks, from September customers will be able to walk . into their bank and simply demand for their account to be transferred . to a rival. Mr Osborne said: 'We’re going to give customers the most powerful weapon of all: choice.' Crucially, . the bank will be obliged to transfer a customer’s direct debit payments . to the new account – ending the weeks of hassle associated with changing . accounts now. That . will allow people to shop around and get better interest rates, forcing . banks to offer better deals for customers to keep them. Consumer . watchdogs repeatedly complain that new customers are wooed with . attractive rates of interest, while existing customers are left . languishing on low rates. The system of wiring money between banks will also be overhauled, to stop it being dominated by a few big players. The ring fence between high street banks and high risk investment arms will be 'electrified' so if a bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank . Mr Osborne said: ‘Why, in the age of instant communication, do small businesses have to wait for several days before they get their money from a credit or debit card payment?  It should be much quicker. ‘Why do cheques take six days to clear? Customers and businesses should be able to move their money round the system much more quickly. ‘Why is it that big banks can move their money around instantly, but when a small business wants to make a payment it takes days?’ The Chancellor said he would ring-fence high street operations from the reckless ‘casino’ investment arms that caused the financial crash. In future no bank will ever again be ‘too big to fail’, he said. ‘When the RBS failed, my predecessor Alistair Darling felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out,’ he said. ‘Not just the RBS on Britain’s high streets, but the trading positions in Asia, the mortgage books in sub-prime America, the property punts in Dubai. ‘I want to make sure that the next time a Chancellor faces that decision they have a choice – to keep the bank branches going, the cash machines operating, while letting the investment arm fail. ‘No more rewards for failure. No more too big to fail. No more taxpayers forking out for the mistakes of others.’ The Treasury today published a bill to prevent taxpayers ever having to shoulder the burden of bailing out fat cat bankers. This will: . Vow: Mr Osborne said when the RBS failed, his predecessor Alistair Darling felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out . The legislation published today implements some of the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking led by Sir John Vickers. It is the result of a compromise deal between Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable. The bill will also contain plans drawn up by Andrew Tyrie, the Tory chairman of the Commission on Banking Standards, to ‘electrify’ the ring fencing of investment operations. That means that in future, if an individual bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank. The Chancellor said the previous regulatory regime – set up by Gordon Brown and Ed Balls – failed to prevent the last crisis. ‘The fire alarm was ringing, but no one was listening,’ he said. ‘And when the crisis hit, the fire was then so great that the whole economy was sacrificed to put it out. The British people need to know that lessons have been learnt. And they have.’ Mr Osborne acknowledged the level of anger among voters that bankers appear to have got away scot free despite wrecking the economy. But he will also argue that Britain needs a stable and effective banking system to help families and businesses and that bashing the banks will not achieve that. Royal Bank of Scotland will be forced to slash staff bonuses to fund a multi-million pound fine for rigging interest rates. The 81 per cent taxpayer-owned bank will this week be docked around £500million for its role in fiddling Libor. Mr Osborne has told the bank the portion of the fine paid to US regulators, likely to be around £400million, should come from bonuses. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, warned the threat to break up banks this would make it more difficult for banks to raise capital to lend to businesses and would also create uncertainty for investors. He said: ‘No other major economy is considering moving away from the universal model of banking because it undermines banks' ability to provide all the services businesses need. ‘Above all, what banks and business need is regulatory certainty so that banks can get on with what they want to do, which is help the economy grow.’ Labour claimed the reforms did not go far enough. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘For all the rhetoric and the partial climbdown he has been forced into, George Osborne is still failing to deliver the radical banking reform we need. 'He has refused to repeat Labour's tax on bank bonuses or implement our legislation on pay transparency. And he has failed to get the banks to lend to businesses, with net lending to small firms falling month by month.’ Choice: Customers will be able to switch accounts between banks more quickly . Bank customers will be able to switch accounts with ease under new rules hailed as a revolution for consumers. Currently, it takes 10 working days to switch an account from one bank to another, but this will be cut down to five in the autumn. Ministers have rejected calls for customers to keep the same account numbers because they feared IT hold-ups would have made the process much longer and put people off moving their accounts. As well as making it easier to move accounts, the Government plans to speed up the process of transferring money between accounts held at different banks. Officials are said to be outraged at the fact that it takes up to three days to pay money from one account into another, and point out that even in relatively poor countries such as South Africa such transfers take no more than 24 hours. The Chancellor also confirmed plans to encourage new banks to open up, increasing competition on the high street.","Chancellor outlines plans to ring-fence high street from investment arms .

Callous: Abdul Sajid, 18, pictured at Liverpool Crown Court during his trial, was convicted of three rape offences and jailed for eight years . A teenage student was subjected to a terrifying gang rape at the hands of three young men who threatened her with a knife and filmed part of her ordeal on a mobile phone. The unsuspecting 19-year-old had gone to the home of Ammar Zahoor to chat and 'chill' with others she knew, but suddenly found herself alone with the 18-year-old and his friend Osman Ali, 20. When the teenager tried to leave she was threatened with a knife and forced to perform a sex act on both men. At the same time one of them spoke to another friend, Abdul Sajid, on the phone and told him to come around to the house in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, for 'some fun'. The victim, who is white, was then . taken upstairs and repeatedly raped by Sajid, and later by Ali and . Zahoor, in a protracted attack she described as a 'living nightmare'. Sentencing . the trio to a total of 24 years, Judge John Phipps said mobile phone . footage of part of the attack 'demonstrated the callous way in which the . defendants went about these offences and the pack mentality which . accompanied them. 'Whether . or not the events were planned before she got to the house, what . happened to her after she arrived at the house amounted to a protracted, . frightening and humiliating ordeal for her. She was treated with . contempt,' he said. 'It was . a group attack, a sustained attack, and the offences involved keeping . her in the house against her will and threats of a knife.' Ali, 20, who was described as the 'ring leader' at Liverpool Crown Court, was sentenced to eight and a half years imprisonment. Sajid, 18, was sentenced to eight years, and Zahoor, also 18, to seven and a half years. Sajid, of Dover Street, was convicted of three rape offences after a trial. Both Ali, of Corbett Street, and Zahoor, of Norman Road, pleaded guilty to two offences of rape. A charge of false imprisonment against all three men, which they denied, was ordered to lie on the file. All of the men, none of whom had any previous convictions, were put on the Sex Offenders Register for life. 'Pack mentality': Sentencing Ali, Zahoor and Sajid at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge John Phipps said they treated the 19-year-old victim with 'contempt' Judge Phipps described the victim as 'open, good-natured and pleasant', but said she had had difficulties with her academic studies and was more vulnerable than other girls her age might have been. Liverpool Crown Court was told the 19-year-old had gone to Zahoor's home - where she had been before without incident - at about 5.30pm on February 1 this year. She had been invited by a friend and when she arrived the guests also included three other young women. When the others left left the victim tried to leave too, but Ali told her she 'wasn't going anywhere', said Stephen McNally, prosecuting. Ali pushed the girl onto a sofa and ordered her to perform a sex act on him and Zahoor. When she refused Ali threatened to get a knife and kill her. Zahoor produced a knife from the kitchen and the terrified victim did as she was told, the court heard. Mr McNally said footage of part of the attack filmed by Zahoor on a mobile phone 'showed Ali treating her contemptuously, laughing...and texting.' Sajid then arrived at the house and joined in the attack having spoken to Ali on the phone. The victim, who wept throughout her long ordeal, was eventually allowed to go home, where she told her sister what had happened. Her sister told their mother and the police were called. Patrick Buckley, defending, said the men 'took advantage of a situation which presented itself and it very quickly got out of control.'","Terrified victim was raped by three men in a long ordeal she described as a 'living nightmare'

The new Archbishop of Canterbury warned David Cameron yesterday that there will be no retreat by the Church of England in its opposition to same-sex marriages. Within minutes of his formal confirmation into the post, the Right Reverend Justin Welby reaffirmed his stand on the new laws to open up marriage to gay and lesbian people. ‘We have made our views clear and I’m very much with the House of Bishops on this,’ said Dr Welby, backing the Synod body which contains the Church’s bishops. He added: ‘The Government wants it. We think there are issues around the way it is going forward.’ The 105th Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby insisted he remained opposed to the government's plans for gay marriage as he took up his post in a ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral . Dr Welby’s message denies the Prime Minister any possibility of a compromise with the Church of England in advance of voting by MPs on the legislation today. It came only three days after the CofE bluntly told MPs it does not trust the promises of the Government that churches will be shielded from the impact of gay marriage law. The Archbishop tried to reassure Mr Cameron that he is not looking to open up his stewardship of the Church of England by picking a fight with the Government. ‘It is not a collision course. It’s just part of the normal discussion that one has,’ Dr Welby said. ‘I have no idea how the vote will go, so I am not going to get into hypothetical questions. I stand, as I have always stood over the last few months, with the statement I made at the announcement of my appointment, which is that I support the Church of England’s position on this. Mr Welby said he had not changed his view on the same-sex wedding plan since being appointed in November . Hundreds of people packed into St Paul's today, for a blessing given by Mr Welby at the close of the ceremony to confirm his election as Archbishop to replace Rowan Williams . ‘We have made many statements about this and I stick with that.’ The Church made its final verdict on the laws clear at the weekend in a briefing paper drawn up for MPs, encouraging them to vote against the legislation. It said Church leaders do not trust the Government’s promises that churches will be immune from legal retribution if they fail to conduct same-sex weddings. MPs were told: ‘We retain serious doubts about whether the proffered legal protection for churches and faiths from discrimination claims would prove durable. Too much emphasis, we believe, is being placed on the personal assurances of ministers.’ The Most Reverend Justin Welby gives his blessing at the close of the ceremony to confirm his election as Archbishop of Canterbury at St Paul's Cathedral . The Church has said protections written into the law would be vulnerable to challenges. The Government claims a ‘quadruple lock’ will ensure churches are not forced to conduct gay marriages, but the CofE has warned a European court ruling could find against the safeguard. The paper warned about ‘uncertain and unforeseen consequences for wider society and the common good when marriage is redefined in gender-neutral terms’. The Church complained that the ‘reshaping and unnecessary politicising of a fundamental social institution’ was not advertised in election manifestos, did not appear in the Queen’s Speech, and has no mandate from the electorate. Dr Welby, 57, spoke after a confirmation service at St Paul’s Cathedral marked the formal beginning of his job as Archbishop. The final step in the process will be his enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral next month. The father of five said he looked forward to his new role ‘but also felt challenged and awed by it. It is an enormous privilege and my experience is to trust in the grace of God, not in your own abilities.’ The Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr Justin Welby, and his wife Caroline on the steps of St Paul's after the ceremony .","The Right Rev Justin Welby insists he has not changed his mind about coalition plans for gay marriage to be legalised .

Fell asleep: Ex-England footballer Paul Merson arrives at Leamington Spa Magistrates' Court, where he pleaded guilty to crashing his Mercedes while over the drink-drive limit . Ex-England footballer Paul Merson has been given a 14-month driving ban after a court heard how he crashed his Mercedes into a 38-tonne military truck while over the legal alcohol limit. Leamington Spa Magistrates’ Court was told that the former Arsenal and Aston Villa star, who pleaded guilty to drink-driving, fell asleep at the wheel on the M40. Merson, who suffered a head injury in the accident last October, was fined £1,500 and ordered to pay £105 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Twice-married Merson, who won two league titles with Arsenal, has fought a well-documented addiction to gambling, alcohol and drugs for more than two decades which drove him to brink of suicide. In 2003, the father-of-five claimed to have won his battles with alcohol and cocaine, but admitted that he was still plagued by his gambling problem. He narrowly avoided losing his home five years later after falling behind with his mortgage payments, and in his recently-released memoir, How Not To Be A Professional Footballer, revealed he had lost some £7million to bookmakers over the years. Magistrates heard today how the Sky Sports pundit was driving to his home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, after having 'a few drinks' at a charity event in London. Merson’s Mercedes ML350 struck the rear of a Ministry of Defence lorry, damaging its rear lights and under-run bars, at about 3.15am on October 12. Prosecutor Philippa Cowley said Merson, who was among several people who called the police, failed a roadside breath-test and was later found to have 124mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - the legal limit is 80mg. Merson, 43, was standing on the hard shoulder when two police constables arrived at the scene, said Ms Cowley. 'It was clear that he had got a head injury and he was very frank with the police,' the lawyer told the court. Lucky to be alive: With his shirt stained with blood and a gash above his eye, Merson heads home after a stay in hospital following last October's crash . Had a few drinks: The Sky Sports pundit was driving a black Mercedes SUV, like the one pictured, when he crashed . 'He said that he had fallen asleep and had been at a charity do for children and had had a few drinks.' Jane Winchester, chairwoman of the magistrates, told him: ""You are disqualified from driving for 14 months. 'If you do drive while disqualified you will be committing a serious offenceand you might be send to prison, do you understand?'Merson, who stared at the floor throughout the 25-minute hearing, replied:'Yes'. Problems: Merson celebrates with Paul Gascoigne during their time together at Middlesbrough. Merson claims he left the club because of its 'drinking culture' The former player - who also represented Middlesbrough andPortsmouth - was pictured leaving hospital after the crash with bloodstains on the sleeves of his white shirt and a nasty gash above his eye.The lorry driver escaped the crash uninjured - though there wasdamage caused to the rear side and under-run bars of his vehicle. Steven Masih, mitigating, told the court Merson drove home after failingto book a hotel room in London. He said: 'Mr Merson is deeply disappointed with this situation. It was a grave error of judgement. 'Mr Merson has a very busy schedule not with football. He is a family man, he has five children. He did not go out with the intention of drinking but when he was there he had a few drinks.' Well-documented addiction: Merson famously celebrated after the 1993 Coca-Cola Cup final by pretending to down drinks . He added: 'He accepts driving on an empty stomach was not necessarily a good idea. It was a grave error of judgement, but he thought it was safe for him to drive home because he was not particularly drunk.'He is deeply remorseful and deeply regretful. It was out of character, anisolated incident, an error which he is adamant will not happen again.' Merson refused to comment as he left court. But speaking after the incident he said he was 'lucky to have survived'. He said: 'I fell asleep and just hit the central reservation. I banged my head on the windscreen and the car is a write-off. He has also agreed to attend a 16-hour rehabilitation course by October, which will reduce his ban by 14 weeks.

Duty: Angela Merkel said Germany must never forget the atrocities committed by the Nazis . German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country can never forget the Nazi Holocaust and says her nation has ‘an everlasting responsibility’ for Nazi crimes. Mrs Merkel, who will fight for re-election for a third time this coming autumn, spoke at the weekend ahead of national commemorations this week remembering the Nazi takeover of Germany on January 30 1933. It marked the start of 12 long years of terror, a world war and the extermination of six million Jews. ‘Naturally, we have an everlasting responsibility for the crimes of national-socialism, for the victims of World War II, and above all, for the Holocaust,’ Mrs Merkel said in a podcast on her website. Hours later there were church services held across Germany on Sunday for Holocaust Memorial Day: on January 27 1945 the Red Army liberated the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz in occupied Poland. Mrs Merkel went on: ‘We must clearly say, generation after generation, and say it again: with courage, civil courage, each individual can help ensure that racism and anti-Semitism have no chance. ‘We’re facing our history, we’re not hiding anything, we’re not repressing anything. We must confront this to make sure we are a good and trustworthy partner in the future, as we already are today, thankfully,’ she said. Multiple events, exhibitions and concerts planned to remember Nazi era for the rest of this year under the title ‘Destroyed Diversity,’ which begin on January 30 in Berlin. In Berlin posters are being put up across the city on special podiums promoting Germans who exemplified diversity. Scroll down for video . Remembrance: A man lights a candle at the Jewish Museum in Moscow. Mrs Merkel added that each individual can help eradicate racism and anti-Semitism . They range from Jewish Nobel physicist . Albert Einstein, who managed to escape from Germany, to Jewish poet . Gertrud Kolmar who did not. She was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943. In . all some 200 people are being honoured at sites across the metropolis. Individual tours are planned to remember resisters like Otto and Elise Hampel, caught and beheaded in 1943, for distributing anonymous postcards around the city decrying the regime after she lost her brother in the campaign against France in 1940. A woman lights a candle in remembrance of the victims of the Holocaust . Their fate inspired the author Hans Fallada to write a novel based on their silent herorism called ‘Alone in Berlin’ which became a global bestseller three years ago. At the scene of the city’s former Gestapo HQ, where the torture cellars now form part of the tour for visitors, an exhibition called ‘Berlin 1933 - The Route to Dictatorship’ opens up on January 31 chronicling the first six months of the regime and the building of its apparatus of repression. On April 4 off the swanky Kurfuerstendamm shopping street in west Berlin an exhibition entitled ‘Career or Civil Courage; Women Under National Socialism’ will open detailing the lot of womenhood under Hitler. On November 9 remembrance of Nazi rule will encompass more special commemorations as it marks the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass, when the regime underwrote a nationwide pogrom against the Jews. Synagogues were burned, hundreds killed or arrested and the broken glass of Jewish businesses littered the streets of German cities and towns; the precursor of the Holocaust that was soon to follow. Major cities like Munich, Duesseldorf, Hamburg, Cologne and Stuttgart have their own programmes to remember the blackest day in German history, but Berlin is the centrepoint of all such commemorations, just as it was the centre of power for Hitler and his gang all those years ago.","Said Germany had 'everlasting responsibility... for victims of World War II and for the Holocaust'

The two holders are set to miss out on a fortune.’ The raffle game plays out alongside the EuroMillions game only in the UK.

It could have been me: Winners Dave and Angela Dawes kept their ticket safe to scoop £101,203,600.70 . In this case the organisation said it could be that the two ticket holders do not even know the Millionaire Raffle exists so might have immediately discarded their tickets as soon as the main EuroMillions draw finished.

The New York Post . reported that there are no plans for a musical show at the Metlife Stadium in New Jersey as NFL officials can't work out how to put on the huge spectacle . in wintry conditions. 'Fierce': Beyonce delighted millions of fans around the world with an energetic and sexy performance at the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday . Powerful: Beyonce was joined by dancers during her performance at the 2013 Super Bowl but there may not be a halftime show next year . Beyonce grabbed a share of the headlines alongside the 35-minute power outage and the Baltimore Ravens narrow victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. On Monday speculation immediately began about who would play next year's event - local rockers Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi were early favorites. Then NFL officials leaked that there are actually no plans for any sort of musical performance. 'It’s because of the cold weather,' one source told the Post. 'It’s not only the acts and the singers . but [also] the crews that have to put the stage together. You know, the . assembly has to be done a certain way,' the official said.

"By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 13:02 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:00 EST, 6 December 2012 . Rating: . Price: From £39.99 / $69.00 (RRP) In ZombiU, it's not about if you die, but when. Against the odds and hounded by hordes of the undead, you're thrown into a zombie-infested London, and must do anything you can to escape in one piece. Along the way you're helped by a man called the Prepper, who sends you on various skirmishes from hacking CCTV cameras to retrieving essential survival kit. Running rampant: Some of London's most iconic landmarks have been infested by the undead . Thankfully, this rather unoriginal plot is made all the more unique by its masterful execution.Once your character is killed, for example, they are no longer playable and you take control of another survivor. Locked up in a safe room, you then have to run back to the spot and finish off your former character (who is now a zombie) to retrieve all your gear. The mechanic works brilliantly. You're responsible for a life, rather than just a generic bot. While the lack of dialogue is perhaps a missed opportunity in a game of this nature, you still become incredibly attached to your character. There's a sense of complete isolation and vulnerability throughout. Whether that's walking through the ghostly corridors of a once thriving school, or curling up in your safe house's bed as the cries of the undead echo through the tunnels. It's a shame, then, that there's not as much freedom in the level design as there should be. They often involve walking through samey, claustrophobic corridors while the more open areas have clear boundaries - defined by a vehicle pile-up or a fence. Watch your step: Often, the Underground provides a safe haven. But getting there is another problem . That being said, there are still plenty of areas to unlock and explore, so you can get a sense of your surroundings and find quick exit points to safe areas. The zombies themselves are wonderfully realised, too. They pose no threat by themselves, but in a pack, they're deadly - placing a huge emphasis on tactics. Often running in all guns blazing results in a quick, and brutal death. But throwing a flare, instead, can create a brief distraction, long enough to run past a horde unscathed. It's these kind of decisions that make ZombiU such a tense experience, made more so by the intuitive controls. The WiiU GamePad has a number of functions, serving as a backpack, map and scanner. At any time during the game you can access your backpack and equip supplies you've amassed from your travels. Gruesome: The Wii U is capable of brilliant detail. Zombies rarely look the same and boast hauntingly realistic tissue damage. They are also drawn to sound and light, so you may want to keep your pistol holstered . When you use it, you're forced to take your eyes away from the main screen (which shifts into a third-person perspective) - leaving you vulnerable to attacks. This instills a sense of urgency which is lacking in many horror games - often choosing to pause the action and provide a brief safe haven. To use the scanner, simply go into a room and tag items of interest. These then appear on the map. There's even a button that lets out a brief pulse, showing you where there are moving objects - reminiscent of the motion tracker in the Aliens films. This is crucial given the fact that enemies are randomly placed. You'll never go into an area and find zombies lurking in exactly the same areas. Combat is hauntingly realistic. Ammo is sparse, so missing the target has serious consequences. But most of the time, you'll stick with melee weapons, such as the baseball bat. Too close for comfort: On their own, zombies are easy to kill (again). In a pack, though, it's a different story . Although suffering from minor (and expected) launch title hiccups, such as clipping and bland textures, ZombiU is a remarkable artistic achievement. Amidst the death are cues of the living world that existed before it. Venture through apartments and you'll see photos, newspapers - intricate details that hammer home the situation, and adding a further emotive incentive to escape alive. But this is adventure you won't want to leave behind, and one that deserves its place among the best horror games ever made.

Former England star Paul Gascoigne has been admitted to a treatment centre in the United States, it has been revealed. The alcoholic former Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Newcastle United star, 45, has 'willingly' been admitted to the Cottonwood clinic near Tuscon, Arizona, his management company said. The move came after fears for the Italia 90 and Euro 96 legend following a number of public appearances in which he appeared unsteady and incoherent. The latest worrying incident came in Bournemouth this morning, when the ex-England player was seen apparently being supported by two burly strangers as he walked through the city centre. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Weak: Former footballer Paul Gascoigne, who has been admitted to a treatment centre in America, is seen here supported by a taxi driver and a passing well-wisher during a shopping trip in Bournemouth city centre today . Gaunt: Gascoigne has been seen looking unwell, causing friends and fans to fear for his future . He also appeared unwell and shaking during a charity appearance in Northampton last week, when he broke down sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans. In a statement, GamePlan Solutions said Gazza had been touched by the help and support shown by fans and figures within football over the past few days. The statement read: 'Alcoholic Paul Gascoigne has been experiencing a tough time of late. 'He has been asking for help and has willingly been admitted to a treatment centre in America. 'He has complex issues that are currently being dealt with by professionals. 'Paul has been extremely touched and overwhelmed by the generous offers of help and support over the past few days. Errand: Gascoigne was apparently buying a phone during his Bournemouth shopping trip this morning . 'He is motivated to fully understand and control his addiction problem under guidance.' Gascoigne today looked gaunt and unwell as he came out of a mobile phone shop in the wake of increasing public concern for his well-being from friends and supporters. Two men at a bus stop approached him to shake his hand and offer their best wishes in his battle against alcoholism. One of the men then held the star by the arm and, along with a waiting taxi driver, helped him walk to his cab. It was apparently the first time Gascoigne had had contact with anyone else since last Friday. Purchase: The star was seen chatting to a shop assistant as the media storm around him grew . In a video of a personal appearance by the 45-year-old last week, he repeatedly holds his head in apparent despair and his speech is barely coherent. It seems his long term battles with . alcohol and drug abuse may not be over – and that his descent from . national idol to grim drunken loneliness is continuing. After . the video emerged, more evidence of his lonely existence was clear at . his £1,600 a month rented three bed flat in Bournemouth. Fallen idol: Looking bloated and emotional, former footballer Paul Gascoigne is said to be in desperate need of help to beat his alcoholism after a shambling performance at an after-dinner event in Northampton last week . Troubled: Gascoigne is said to have told the audience he had been on a three-day whiskey bender, prompting some in the crowd to comment they thought the Geordie was 'dying in front of our eyes' Low: Gascoigne got more emotional as his performance went on and he is said to have burst into tears between abusive tirades against former team mates . Over the weekend, Gascoigne emerged several times, taking minicabs, to buy beer from a newsagent or to cruise the streets, seemingly aimlessly. Despite growing concern over his physical and mental health, the fallen footballer was apparently alone. Gascoigne’s shambolic public appearance . was caught on video in front of a crowd of 500 at ‘An evening with Paul . Gascoigne’ at the Park Inn hotel in Northampton on Thursday. A fresh-faced and healthy-looking in Gascoigne in 2004 (left) and pictured looking gaunt and bald last year . Audience members watched as he mumbled stories and swore repeatedly in response to questions from his agent Terry Baker, who was interviewing him for the benefit of the audience. Gascoigne began by announcing: ‘I’ve had a f****** hard month. F****** hell.’ He also seemed to sob, and repeatedly raised his hand to his face. While holding the microphone with his right hand it shook so uncontrollably that he had to steady it with his left. At one stage Gascoigne mumbled ‘I’ve been on a whisky diet’. One onlooker said he seemed to be ‘dying in front of our eyes’. Star: Gascoigne celebrating a trophy with Ally McCoist for former club Glasgow Rangers. 'Gazza' as he is affectionately known was at one stage one of the best footballers in the world . Mr Baker admitted Gascoigne had drunk at least two cans and a bottle of lager before the event. He said the star needed ‘immediate help’ and was lonely living far from his family and roots in the North East. Mr Baker said: ‘There is unbelievable sympathy for him out there from the public but he is sitting at his house on his own.’ He implied Gascoigne might need to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act for his own safety. ‘Maybe no one can save him,’ Mr Baker added. Gascoigne was sectioned twice in 2008. At the weekend he refused to speak to reporters. Gascoigne was still young when hailed as a footballing superstar – but his heavy drinking meant he was never far from the news pages. He won 57 England caps, and played for clubs including Newcastle and Tottenham before retiring in 2004. The world of football has shown its concern at the latest troubled period in the life of Gascoigne, one of England's most naturally gifted players ever. Clarke Carlisle, chairman of the . Professional Footballers' Association, told Radio 4's Today Programme: . 'We'll continue to give him our full support because that's what we're . here for. 'We have put . several people to Gazza and, bar manhandling him and dragging him to a . facility, which unfortunately we can't do and would do if we could, we . have put everyone we possibly can across his path. 'We have been in touch with his friends, his advisers, and agents and we will do again.' Concern: Clarke Carlisle (left), chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, and former team-mate Gary Lineker (right) have shown their concern at the latest troubles facing Gascoigne . Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker admits he is struggling to see a positive outcome for his former England and Tottenham team-mate Gascoigne, writing on Twitter: 'I can only hope he finds peace somehow, but fear those hopes may be forlorn.' Frank Lampard told today how his 'idol' Gascoigne took him under his wing as a young player. He told ITV News: 'I was lucky enough to be involved in Euro '96 with him as a kid and he took me under his wing. 'I was completely in awe of his character, how much he was joking around and more than that the quality of his football. 'I've got no message for him now, I don't know enough about it. I've just read and I wouldn't want to read too much into that. 'Whatever anyone says about Paul Gascoigne, he was my hero and he'll always be that.' Gascoigne's battle with alcohol seemed all too apparent at the weekend. On Saturday morning he was seen buying six cans of lager in a newsagents before going to a pub. Yesterday he took two apparently aimless cab rides – throwing a can of lager out of the vehicle on one trip. He was later seen urinating on the balcony of his flat.

Jay, a popular teenager, was killed by a single knife wound to his heart after a row outside a party in an affluent area of Colchester, Essex.

Pain: Caroline Shearer (left) and Jay's sister Holly Fairburn are overwhelmed with grief as they make their appeal . 'Jay should have been 18 - all I could buy him was two helium balloons because someone murdered him.' Jay's sister, Holly Fairburn, 25, sat alongside her mum but was too upset to talk publicly. Mrs Shearer added: 'This has not just affected me and Holly - it has affected the community, so please, if you have got any decent bone in your body, then come forward for Jay. 'Somebody out there has got to have a heart, somebody out there knows who did this and by hiding them you are adding to the misery and making it worse for all of us.' Detectives have made a series of arrests as they try to trace Jay's killer, but so far no one has been charged with the offence and, crucially, the murder weapon - believed to be a knife - has not been traced. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Parkes, today unveiled a red and white patterned River Island T-shirt, thought to have been the same type as worn by one of Jay's killers. Happier times: Jay and his mother Caroline today would have been his 18th birthday . He said: 'We have seized the clothing of those that police suspect to be involved with this. 'There is one item which we have yet to recover - it's a red and white T-shirt which is made by River Island and I am interested in finding that T-shirt so if you know where that T-shirt was disposed of, if you know where that T-shirt is at this moment, please get in touch. That could be a key bit of information for us.' The officer, sat alongside Mrs Shearer, said police were still, four months on, piecing together minute details which they hope will give them the breakthrough in the case. Clue: Essex Police say the killer may have been wearing a red-and-white River Island polo shirt similar to the one pictured . He said: 'The way that we are going to successfully take this matter to court, to successfully prosecute Jay's killer, is to reconstruct the actions of Jay and Jay's attackers. 'But we need to do that frame by frame so this is all about trying to get the minutest detail - the smallest amount of information could be key. 'Let the police decide what was relevant.' DCI Parkes said those who had not come forward with information were protecting Jay's killer through 'some sense of mistaken loyalty'. He described the party which spun out of control as well-organised with the family going to great lengths to ensure that everybody was as safe as they could be. However, a fight started at the party and Jay was stabbed after 'standing his ground'. Police today refused to disclose what had triggered the fight for operational reasons. Mrs Shearer has launched a high-profile anti-knives campaign since her son's death. She hopes to educate youngsters about the dangers of carrying knives. Four teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of murder and another four people were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. All eight have been released on police bail until March 22. A 17-year-old who was arrested previously on suspicion of Jay's murder was today released from his bail and will face no further action. Anyone with information about the killing should contact the investigation team on 01206 576845 or text 07841 112146 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

Dreamliners are still grounded because of unsafe batteries, but restrictions against flying with such batteries as cargo have recently been lifted. Pilots and safety advocates say the . situation doesn't make sense. If the 787's battery system is too risky . to allow the planes to fly, then it's too risky to ship the same . batteries as cargo on airliners, they said. No fly zone: Boeing saw its new 787 'Dreamliner' plane grounded worldwide after a Japan Airlines 787 caught fire in Boston Jan. 7 and an All Nippon Airlines Dreamliner (pictured) was forced into an emergency landing Jan. 16 . The planes were grounded worldwide nearly three weeks ago after their lithium ion batteries to a fire in one aircraft and smoke in another. But new rules exempt aircraft batteries from the ban on large lithium ion batteries as cargo on flights by passenger planes. In effect, that means the Dreamliner's batteries are now allowed to fly only if they're not attached to a Dreamliner. The regulations were published on Jan. 7, the same day as a battery fire in a Japan Airlines 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport that took firefighters nearly 40 minutes to put out. The timing of the two events appears coincidental. 'These incidents have raised the whole . issue of lithium batteries and their use in aviation,' said Jim Hall, a . former National Transportation Safety Board chairman. 'Any transport of . lithium batteries on commercial aircraft for any purpose should be . suspended until (an) NTSB investigation is complete and we know more . about this entire issue.' Holding pattern: Dreamliners at LAX are currently grounded (pictured), as they are across the globe, for problems arising from their large onboard lithium batteries . Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, a former US Airways pilot famed for his precision flying that enabled passengers and crew to survive an emergency landing on the Hudson River in New York, said in an interview that he wouldn't be comfortable flying an airliner that carried lithium ion aircraft batteries in its cargo hold. 'The potential for self-ignition, for . uncontained fires, is huge,' he said. The new regulations 'need to be . looked at very hard in the cold light of day, particularly with what has . happened with the 787 batteries.' Sad debut: A Qatar Airlines stewardess poses in the long-awaited new jet's business class section just before problems with the plane's lithium ion batteries cut its debut short . The battery rules were changed in order to conform U.S. shipping requirements with international standards as required by Congress, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said in a statement. Flight risk: Seen here in publicity animation, the Dreamliner has batteries that are lighter than most jets' but experts wonder if it comes at the cost of safety . The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation standards, adopted the aircraft battery cargo exemption in October 2011, and it went into effect Jan. 1. The organization's standards normally aren't binding. But a provision inserted into U.S. law at the behest of the battery industry and their shippers says the rules can't be stricter than the U.N. agency's standards. Previously, U.S. regulations prohibited the shipment of lithium ion batteries on passenger planes in packages weighing more than 11 pounds, although heavier batteries could be shipped on cargo planes. The new rules allow the shipment of lithium ion batteries weighing as much as 77 pounds, but only if they are aircraft batteries. Shipments of other lithium ion batteries greater than 11 pounds are still prohibited. The 787's two batteries weigh 63 pounds each. It's the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which weigh less and store more power than other batteries of a similar size. The aircraft battery exemption was created for the convenience of the airline industry, which wants to be able to quickly ship replacement batteries to planes whose batteries are depleted or have failed. Sometimes it's faster to do that using a passenger plane. The NTSB is investigating the cause of the 787 battery fire in Boston. Japanese authorities are investigating a battery failure that led to an emergency landing by an All Nippon Airways 787 on Jan. 16. All Dreamliners, which are operated by eight airlines in seven countries, have since been grounded. The International Air Transport Association, which represents U.S. airlines and other carriers that fly internationally, asked for the aircraft battery exemption at the October 2011 meeting of the U.N. agency's dangerous goods committee. Some fearful: Some say the new regulations allowing jets to carry big lithium batteries, like the ones that grounded two Dreamliners, are risky . The association argued that the exemption would give airlines 'significant operational flexibility in being able to move aircraft batteries on a passenger aircraft where cargo aircraft may not be available over the route, or within the time required if a battery is required at short notice,' according to a copy of the request obtained by The Associated Press. Since the batteries have to meet special safety standards in order to be installed on planes, 'it is believed that exceeding the (11-pound) limit for passenger aircraft will not compromise safety,' the request said. Some members of the committee opposed allowing shipments of lithium ion aircraft batteries on passenger planes, saying safety regulations that let the batteries be used onboard planes don't necessarily ensure they can be transported safely as cargo, according to a summary of the meeting posted online by the U.N. agency. 'One member had discussed this proposal with an engineer in their (country's) airworthiness office who was familiar with standards for batteries installed in aircraft,' the summary said. 'This colleague did not believe testing standards for installed aircraft batteries warranted special treatment for transport purposes.' It was pointed out that the safety standards applied to batteries used in the operation of an aircraft are 'narrowly tailored to performance issues and how the battery interacted with aircraft systems,' the summary said. The summary doesn't identify the committee member, but a source familiar with the deliberations said it was the U.S. representative, Janet McLaughlin. She abstained from the vote on the standards, said a federal official with knowledge of the meeting. Neither source was authorized to comment publicly and both spoke only on condition of anonymity. More to come: A forthcoming model from Airbus will also carry the lithium batteries some fear are too dangerous for use, or even transport, aboard passenger jets . The Japan Airlines fire ignited about half an hour after the plane had landed in Boston and nearly 200 passengers and crew members had disembarked. Firefighters were alerted after a cleaning crew working in the plane smelled smoke. It took nearly 40 minutes to put out the fire. The 'multiple systems' that were designed to prevent the 787's batteries from catching fire 'did not work as intended,' Deborah Hersman, the current NTSB chairman, told reporters recently. The 'expectation in aviation is never to experience a fire on an aircraft,' she said. Concern about transport of lithium ion aircraft batteries on passenger planes isn't limited to the batteries used in the 787. The Airbus A350, expected to be ready next year, will also make extensive use of lithium ion batteries. Aircraft manufacturers are also considering retrofitting some planes to replace their batteries with lithium ion batteries to save weight, according to the airline association. The less a plane weighs, the less fuel it burns. Fuel is the biggest operating expense of most airlines. Cargo airline pilots long have complained about the dangers of transporting lithium batteries. The batteries are suspected of causing or contributing to the severity of an onboard fire that led to the September 2010 crash of a United Parcel Service plane near Dubai, killing both pilots. The two pilots of another UPS plane barely managed to escape the aircraft before it was consumed by fire moments after landing in Philadelphia in 2006. Lithium-ion batteries can short circuit and ignite if they are improperly packaged, damaged or have manufacturing defects. Fires involving rechargeable lithium-ion batteries can reach 1,100 degrees, close to the melting point of aluminum, a key material in the construction of most airliners.","Boeing's 787 is still grounded because of fears the lithium ion batteries is unsafe to fly .

Voicing concerns: A student passes protesting parents on his arrival at Miramonte Elementary school yesterday. More than a quarter of students were absent yesterday while parents demanded more protection . Furious: Parent Tessi Garcia airs her grievances to reporters over the sex abuse scandal that has rocked the school . 'The last thing I'm worried about is a budget issue,' Deasy said. 'The No 1 thing I'm worried about is the students.' All employees will be paid during the investigation, district spokesman Tom Waldman said. Officials didn't know how long the investigation will take. School officials cancelled classes at the school on Tuesday and Wednesday as a cooling-off period, Waldman said. All current staff members will report to another location, where they will be interviewed, he said. Deasy emphasized that all staff members being brought into the classroom went through a 'very rigorous screening process.'

'It's everyone's responsibility to ensure that any and all allegations are thoughtfully and carefully investigated.' Maria Jimenez, 51, said the parents of children enrolled at Miramonte are divided over the move. 'Some are in favor. Others are against it because they did this without advising us or consulting us,' she said. More than a quarter of the students at Miramonte were absent from school Monday while parents demanded more protection at the school, with attendance reaching just 72 percent, according to figures from the Los Angeles Unified School District. The protest was an unusual event in the poor, overwhelmingly Latino neighborhood, where many parents and students struggle with the English language. Many people finally gathered around . former state senator-turned-lawyer Martha Escutia, who lectured them in . Spanish about how to organize for the media and suggested a catchy name . for their fledgling movement: Mothers of Miramonte.

Berndt, 61, remains jailed on $23million bail and could face life in prison if convicted. Springer, 49, was arrested on suspicion of fondling two girls in his classroom. He was being held on $2million bail. Springer taught at Miramonte for his entire career, which started in 1986, the district said. He taught second grade. The school board is scheduled to discuss firing him in a closed-door meeting Tuesday. Furore: Members of the media gather outside the Miramonte last Friday following the arrest of Springer, who was pulled from a classroom just days after Berndt was charged . Concern: Students are escorted to a bus outside Miramonte, which will be closed for two days this week . Investigators said they know of no connection between the Miramonte cases. Berndt and Springer know each other and took their classes on at least two joint field trips in the past decade, according to the Los Angeles Times. The district set up a toll-free hotline on Monday to receive reports of suspected abuse at Miramonte, said school board President Monica Garcia in a statement. Garcia added that the district would step up efforts to ensure students and staff realized the importance of reporting misconduct. In the same school district, a janitor at a San Fernando Valley elementary school was arrested on suspicion of committing a lewd act with a child on a campus. Accused: Berndt, pictured with a student in 2003, is suspected of blindfolding children in his class and spoon feeding them his semen .

Alone: The charity started the search for volunteers to befriend pensioners after a study found more than a third of men over 75 battle loneliness (file picture) A football match or a busy pub are perhaps not the first places you’d expect to find would-be volunteers for the WRVS. But that’s exactly where a manhunt for members to befriend male pensioners may take an organisation which is often identified with women’s flower arranging or tea afternoons. The WRVS (Women’s Royal Voluntary Services) has launched the search after a study found that more than a third of men over 75 – around 200,000 – battle loneliness and spend 12 hours a day or even more on their own. These men are less likely to confide in their friends and family about their feelings and so may become increasingly isolated. The WRVS believes the issue may be alleviated by recruiting male volunteers who can be companions to the over-75s for social activities or to watch sports together. In its drive for male members, the organisation hopes to shed the ‘women-only’ image which has persisted despite the fact that it already has 6,000 men currently among its 40,000 members . Founded in 1938 by Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading as a British women’s organisation to aid civilians, its women played a crucial role on the home front during the Second World War. The WRVS took in its first male recruits in 1949. It now provides a range of services, including Meals on Wheels, community transport and ‘Good Neighbours’ companions for those who live alone, for 100,000 pensioners and housebound people each month. Sarah Farndale, of the WRVS, said: ‘We are launching a manhunt. More male volunteers are needed to tackle the loneliness experienced by many older men which can have a detrimental effect on their physical health and wellbeing. ‘Instead of a lady popping in to an older guy’s house for a cup of tea and a biscuit, a male volunteer who will go down the pub or to the football or cricket with them can make all the difference.’ The WRVS recruitment drive follows research showing that more than 3.2million plan to start volunteering – many inspired by the  ordinary men and women who were Games Makers at last year’s London Olympics.

He said : 'It was good fun, wasn't it? It was a laugh and good fun to film.' Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits . on the House of Commons culture, media and sport committee, said Ofcom should carry out a full review of the show. He added: ‘Decisions like these start to make the case for an organisation like Ofcom being replaced by an organisation with more gumption and sharper teeth.’ Mark Pritchard, a fellow Tory MP, said: ‘I am disappointed that Ofcom has not taken this issue seriously. ‘These comments caused gross offence and went beyond the realms of decency. I’m surprised Ofcom has decided not to investigate a matter that caused offence to hundreds of people through the country. It needs to be far more robust.’ Ofcom said it was not investigating the show, which was also repeated,  because it aired after the watershed, was preceded with a warning and was in line with ‘audience expectations’ for a satirical show.

Considering the violent and bloody battlefield death of the monarch it is thought to belong to, this skull seems in remarkably good condition. Particularly as it is part of a skeleton which has spent more than 500 years beneath what is now a social services office car park. But this morning, archaeologists searching for Richard III’s remains will release the results of DNA tests which are expected to confirm this was indeed the head which once bore the English crown. Royal remains? The skull of the skeleton found in a Leicester car par. It is thought it could be that of Richard III . Violent demise: A painting of King Richard III by an unknown artist from the 16th Century. He died in battle in 1485 . The skull was part of a skeleton – complete with a metal arrowhead embedded in its spine and signs of ‘battle trauma’ – which was unearthed by University of Leicester archaeologists in September, two weeks after they began excavating the city centre site of the former Greyfriars church. The last medieval king of England died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, defeated by an army led by Henry Tudor. According to historical records, his body was taken 15 miles to Leicester where it was displayed as proof of his death before being buried in the Franciscan friary. When the body was unearthed in the council-owned Grey Friars car park, it was discovered the skeleton had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head consistent with recorded details of both the monarch’s appearance and 1485 death – prompting those involved in the dig to herald the find as ‘momentous’. Major find? Karen Ladniuk, from the Richard III society, cleaning a path made from re-used medieval tiles during the excavation of the car park behind council offices in Leicester . Tantalisingly, only the front of the skull was visible on the image released by the university yesterday. But at today’s ‘major announcement’, the skeleton is expected to be crowned that of Richard III. Dr Jo Appleby, a lecturer in Human Bioarchaeology at the university’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History, who has carried out months of analysis of the remains, said: ‘The skull was in good condition, although fragile and was able to give us detailed information about this individual. ‘It has been CT scanned at high resolution in order to allow us to investigate interesting features in as much detail as possible. ‘In order to determine whether this is Richard III we have built up a biological profile of its characteristics. ‘We have also carefully examined the skeleton for traces of a violent death.’ It is also expected to be confirmed that the skeleton was buried in neither a shroud nor a coffin which, while unusual for a medieval king, ties in with historical accounts that Richard was ‘irreverently buried’ by his successor Henry VII. As well as comparing DNA from the bones with that of a direct descendant of the king’s sister, Anne of York, they have been subject to carbon dating – which can date bones to between 70 and 100 years – and other studies including environmental analysis. Richard Taylor, deputy registrar of the University of Leicester, said the findings could ‘prove to be one of the biggest archaeological discoveries of recent times’. A documentary on the dig will be shown on Channel 4 at 9pm tonight.

An aeroplane which veered off a runway after landing in strong winds was re-painted white to conceal the airline's insignia to avoid bad publicity. The ATR-72 turboprop plane, which belonged to Romanian carrier Carpatair but was leased by Italian carrier Alitalia, was re-painted to protect the brand's reputation, officials have said, causing anger among unions. Displaying the Alitalia colours and logo, the plane crashed on Saturday injuring six, but by Sunday it had been painted white by Alitalia staff - before it was even moved from the crash site. Scroll down for video . Italian colours: The plane veered off a runway after landing in strong winds while operating under Alitalia colours, injuring six people onboard . Paint job: The plane on Sunday after it had been re-painted, leaving no evidence of the Italian carrier's insignia . The plane, which was traveling from Pisa-Galileo Airport to Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome, had the Italian airline’s name visible on its fuselage but after it was re-painted, all that remained was a small Romanian flag indicating the origin of the aircraft's owner, a budget airline based in Timisoara, Romania. Alitalia argued that the paint job was standard corporate practice to protect brand reputation and operated all over the world . Giancarlo Schisano, Alitalia's director of operations, was quoted in The Daily Telegraph saying: ‘Blocking out a carrier's livery is a normal way of protecting a company's reputation, and even more in this case, because it is not an Alitalia plane.’ Protecting the brand: The ATR-72 turboprop plane clearly showed the Alitalia logo and colours after the crash but the plane, which was leased by the Italian carrier by Romanian carrier Carpatair, was painted soon afterwards . Evidence disguised: The small Romanian flag (above the windows) indicated that the plane was actually a Romanian aircraft. After the plane was re-painted, the flag was all that remained of the insignia . An Alitalia spokesperson said: ‘This is something that is done by airline companies in many countries and we are surprised that such a fuss is being made. It is a matter of brand protection.’ Passengers onboard said the Italian carrier's insignia was misleading because they thought they were flying on an Alitalia plane. One female passenger told Italian media: ‘I bought the ticket online from the Alitalia website and all the markings on the plane are Alitalia. What happened is shameful.’ Passengers felt misled: About 50 people were aboard the plane and some told Italian media that they were under the impression they were flying on an Italian plane . 'Not an Alitalia plane': The Italian carrier's director of operations said the paint job was standard corporate practice that operated all over the world . Of the six passengers injured, a girl with a spinal injury was transported to the Gemelli hospital by ambulance. Winds were steady at about 32 mph with gusts up to 47 mph and there were scattered clouds at the time of the crash, according to local reports. About 50 people were aboard the plane, which ended up in the grass, slightly inclined and with damaged landing gear. The accident temporarily closed the airport.

Racial impact: A study into interracial adoption in the UK found that orphans experience some form of racism or prejudice in child and adulthood . Children from ethnic minorities adopted by white parents are deeply affected by cultural and racial differences, a study has found. The research challenges the government’s proposed adoption policy reforms which aim to make it easier for prospective parents to adopt. The study into the long-term impact of interracial adoption in the UK found that the orphans had all experienced some form of racism or prejudice in both child and adulthood ranging from playground name-calling as a child to serious racist attacks. The government is currently trying to make the adoption process swifter and place more children with loving families after it was revealed that children seeking adoption languish in care for up to three years in some local authorities. The research done by the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) investigated how 72 orphaned women abandoned as infants in Hong Kong fared in life over 50 years. The study found that some of the women found it difficult to come to terms with their separation from their birth family and being Chinese in the UK. Some ‘felt alienated, struggled with conflicts of dual/multiple identities and had experienced race-based mistreatment’. When asked how they usually described their ethnicity, half identified themselves as Chinese, 19 per cent as British and 15 per cent as British-Chinese while the remainder used personal definitions. Julia Feast, co-author of the project, said of the study: ‘It attests to the importance of family life in providing nurture, care, stimulation and opportunity even when children have had a poor start in life. ‘Whilst the findings are in the main very positive, the challenges and complexities of inter-country adoption should not be underestimated.’ Some participants found childhood and adolescence exceptionally traumatic, with 54 per cent feeling uncomfortable after comments made by their adoptive family about their appearance and 75 per cent said they wished they looked less Chinese. John Simmonds , director of policy, research and development at the BAAF, recommended the government spend more time considering legislation. He told The Observer: ‘If the government has the view that a child being adopted from a different country, religion, culture, language, is a marginal issue that becomes an irrelevance over the course of time given the benefits of adoption, then that is not what this study has said.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove, who was adopted at four months, hopes to stop councils blocking mixed-race adoptions as part of radical reforms to ensure children are removed from unfit parents more quickly. Mr Gove has said there was ‘horrifying’ evidence that children were being left in dangerous homes for too long. He said local councils were blocking potential adoptions purely because would-be parents were not the same race as the child. Of 3,600 children in care under the age of one, only 60 were adopted last year. Black children were three times less likely to find new parents than white ones. Mr Gove said he was deeply angered . that falling numbers of adoptions – a 17 per cent decline in the last . decade – meant a ‘cruel rationing of human love for those most in need’. The . Education Secretary said couples were being turned down for trivial . reasons, including one case in which a couple who had already adopted . five children successfully could not take on another until they bought . an electric kettle with a shorter lead. Questions reform: The study challenges the government's proposed adoption policy reforms which aim to make it easier for prospective parents to adopt (file picture) Other couples are being asked questions such as whether they have non-slip mats in the shower, and asked to fill out nine pages of forms about the potential risks posed by their pets. The Department for Education said: ‘We are changing the law to ensure black and minority ethnic children - who take on average a year longer to be adopted than white children - are not left waiting in care any longer than necessary.’ The women in the study were mostly abandoned as infants (and left to be found) and spent between eight and 72 months in one of four orphanages in Hong Kong. Whilst they appeared to have experienced a reasonable quality of physical and medical care and nutrition in comparison to the globally depriving environments reported in other adoption studies, they lacked the consistent one-to-one care and stimulation that infants typically need for their proper development.","The study investigated the long-term impact of interracial adoption in the UK .

'Husband and wife': President Hollande's girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler will be treated as his wife during a trip to India to avoid any protocol problems . French president Francois Hollande’s girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler will be treated as his ‘honorary wife’ on a state visit to India to avoid protocol problems in the conservative country. Hardline religious leaders had demanded that Mr Hollande travel alone to India on the trip later this month because he and his partner are ‘living in sin’. But the Indian government has now agreed to relax their diplomatic rules and treat the 47-year-old divorcee as his legal wife. The Asian Age newspaper reported: 'Every honour reserved for the wives of heads of state will be afforded to Ms Trierweiler when she visits. 'She will get the full Indian red carpet treatment.' The decision to welcome the French First Lady as the president’s wife on February 14 is a major U-turn on the Indian’s treatment of Carla Bruni five years ago. She was forced to loiter in her Delhi hotel - where she had her own room - while boyfriend and president Nicolas Sarkozy attended a string of official functions. Bruni was not even allowed to accompany Sarkozy at all when he visited the strict Muslim kingdon of Saudi Arabia, where unmarried couples are not allowed to be alone together. Ms Trierweiler was left seething last year on a visit to Washington DC when American journalists repeatedly quizzed her about her status at a G8 summit. She told French newspapers on her return: 'They kept asking if I was actually allowed to be there. What kind of era are we living in.' Ms Trierweiler has also told the French media that she and Mr Hollande - who have been together for five years - ‘have no current plans to marry’. She said: 'I’m not so sure it will pose a diplomatic problem - except perhaps on a visit to the Pope. Barred: The decision to welcome the French First Lady comes five years after Carla Bruni was forced to loiter in her Delhi hotel while boyfriend and president Nicolas Sarkozy attended a string of official functions . 'Frankly, it’s not a subject that preoccupies me. This marriage issue is first and foremost a private matter for us.' French constitutional expert Christian Delporte added: 'The fact that Francois Hollande and Ms Trierweiler are not married may not bother the French. Here, public and private life are separate. 'But it is not the same in some other countries, where their relationship may be viewed as sinful. 'If they don’t marry then the same thing could happen to him as to Mr Sarkozy, where whatever his private feelings, he gets married out of his obligation to better perform his duties to France.' Le Figaro newspaper added: 'There are those close to Mr Hollande who are starting to advise him to do precisely this and do it within a few weeks, just to avoid any possible controversy on his trips overseas.'","Government agrees to relax rules despite opposition from hardline religious leaders .

Vice President Joe Biden will meet Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov this weekend to try to spark new U.S.-Russia talks over reducing their countries' nuclear arsenals. The meeting will take place in Munich, Germany, before National Security Advisor Tom Donilon travels to Moscow for a second round of talks next month. It comes after years of tension between the U.S. and Russia that has included President Vladimir Putin accusing the . U.S. of meddling in his country's politics. Reduction talks: A Russian Topol-12M mobile nuclear missile is being moved at a strategic forces base near the central Russian city of Yoshkar-Ola . Obama also made unfavourable headlines at his last meeting . with Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in March at a nuclear security summit in South Korea. The President was overheard saying he would have more 'flexibility' to work . with Russia on missile defence after the U.S. presidential election. Seizing on the comments, 43 Republican . senators sent a letter to the president saying any concessions to the . Russians would run counter to U.S. safety and security, and contradict . assurances Obama gave the Senate when he secured ratification of the New . START arms reduction treaty in December 2010. Russian fears of new U.S. missiles at . its doorstep in Europe have also helped to prevent further progress on nuclear . arms reductions after the breakthrough New Start agreement three years ago. In an interview last week, Medvedev explained that Obama was signaling he would have more negotiating power on these subjects, but said that the two countries were still quite far apart. 'Any U.S. President during his second term can take a stronger position and act in a more decisive manner, and that is exactly what Barack meant,' Medvedev said. Talks: Vice President Joe Biden (left), pictured with President Barack Obama (right), will meet Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to negotiate reducing their countries' nuclear arsenals . Far apart: Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will meet Biden in Munich, Germany, before National Security Advisor Tom Donilon travels to Moscow for a second round of talks next month . 'But if we talk about the subject . itself, it is extremely difficult, and so far we don't see any . flexibility. There are no easy solutions in terms of anti-missile . defense. There is no flexibility. 'We have not changed our previous . positions. The U.S. has one opinion, and the Russian Federation, . unfortunately, has a different opinion. These positions are not getting . any closer.' Four years ago Biden spoke of the Obama administration's desire  'reset' U.S.-Russian relations after years of deterioration during the George W. Bush presidency. Republicans fear the upcoming meetings with Russian leaders will propose unilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear stockpiles or alterations to U.S. missile-defence plans as an enticement for Russia to sit down for new talks. In February 2011 the U.S. and Russia finalised a landmark arms treaty to limit the nuclear arsenals of the former Cold War foes. The New START treaty limits each side to 1,550 strategic warheads, down from 2,200 and re-established a monitoring system that ended in 2009. The agreement, a cornerstone of Barack Obama's efforts to 'reset' US relations with Russia, came into effect as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exchanged ratification papers with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Munich. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed it as a 'milestone on the road to our ultimate goal: achieving a world free of nuclear weapons'. The seven-year New START treaty was the first major revamping of nuclear disarmament . deals since the late Cold War era. It was approved by the U.S. Senate in . December 2010 after a bruising fight during which Obama pressed strongly for . its passage. Russia ratified the deal the following month. The Cable reported that in a letter to Biden Republican Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, . said: 'Ahead of your unannounced discussions with Russian Foreign . Minister Lavrov this weekend in Munich, and prior to Mr Donilon's . forthcoming February discussions in Moscow, I write seeking your . assurance as to President Obama's plans for future potential U.S. arms . reductions.' Rogers and other Republicans are worried . that the Obama administration may not pursue a new treaty, but instead . strike a deal with Russia that won't have to be approved by Congress. Donilon intends to transmit a personal letter to Putin from Obama 'articulating his plans for further U.S. arms reductions and perhaps even agreements about U.S. missile defenses to entice Russia to the negotiating table,' Rogers wrote, according to The Cable. The State Department's International Security Advisory Board (ISAB), which reports to acting Under Secretary for Arms Control Rose Gottemoeller, issued a report last November spelling out how further nuclear reductions might be achieved, with or without the cooperation of the Senate or the Russians. The ISAB presented options for three scenarios: 'completing the New START Treaty reductions early; working with Russia on transparency and verification of nonstrategic nuclear weapons; and engaging in parallel nuclear arms reductions to levels below New START, if Russia is willing to reciprocate.' 'Unilateral and coordinated reductions can be quicker and less politically costly ... relative to treaties with adversarial negotiations and difficult ratification processes,' the report stated. Administration critics are already preparing to fight any attempt by the White House to push forward with nuclear reductions absent the consent of the Senate. 'Senators should block end-runs around the Constitution's treaty clause,' wrote Bush administration officials John Bolton and John Yoo in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month. 'An informal agreement would prevent effective congressional scrutiny of the unwise rush to slash the nuclear arsenal, America's ultimate national-security safeguard and a crucial buttress of world peace.'","Meeting between statesmen will take place in Munich, Germany .

It's a stark warning from the institution that ran the country until last year as Cairo's first freely elected leader struggles to contain bloody street violence. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, appointed by President Mohamed Mursi last year to head the military, added in a statement on Tuesday that one of the primary goals of deploying troops in cities on the Suez Canal was to protect the waterway that is vital for Egypt's economy and world trade. Egyptian protesters clash with security forces in front of the Semiramis hotel in Central Cairo today . Egyptian protesters celebrate the capture of a state security armoured vehicle seized in Tahir square . Anti-Mursi protesters celebrate on the military vehicle as troops try to control the recent outbreak of trouble . Sisi's comments, published on an official army Facebook page, followed 52 deaths in the past week as a result of disorder. It highlighted the mounting sense of crisis facing Egypt and its Islamist head of state who is struggling to fix a teetering economy and needs to prepare Egypt for a parliamentary election in a few months that is meant to cement the new democracy. After almost seven months since Mursi took office, Egypt politics have become even more deeply polarised. Opponents spurned a call by Mursi for talks on Monday to try to end the violence. Instead, protesters have rallied in Cairo and Alexandria, and in the three Suez Canal cities - Port Said, Ismailia and Suez - where Mursi imposed emergency rule. Today, thousands were again on the streets of Port Said to mourn the deaths of two people in the latest clashes there, taking the total toll in Mediterranean port alone to 42 people. Most were killed by gunshots in a city where weapons are rife. Mohamed Ezz, a Port Said resident speaking by telephone, heard heavy gunfire through the night. 'Gunshots damaged the balcony of my flat, so I went to stay with my brother,' he said. Residents in the three canal cities had taken to the streets in protest at a nightly curfew now in place there. Protesters opposing Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi shout slogans as they march despite a night-time curfew in the city of Suez last night . Egyptian protesters defied curfew in restive towns along the Suez . Canal, attacking police stations and ignoring emergency rule imposed by President Mohamed Mursi to end days of clashes that have killed . at least 52 . In Cairo on Tuesday afternoon, police again fired teargas as stone-throwing youths in a street near Tahrir Square, the centre of the 2011 uprising. Egyptian army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi said political strife was pushing state to brink of collapse . But the clashes were less intense than previous days and traffic was able to cross the area. Street cleaners swept up the remains of burnt tyres and other debris. Street flare-ups are a common occurrence in divided Egypt, frustrating many people desperate for order and economic growth. Although the general's comments were . notably blunt, Egypt's military has voiced similar concerns in the past, . pledging to protect the nation. But it has refused to be drawn back . into a direct political role after its reputation as a neutral party . took a pounding during the 17 months after Mubarak fell. 'Egyptians . are really alarmed by what is going on,' said Cairo-based analyst . Elijah Zarwan, adding that the army was reflecting that broader concern . among the wider public. 'But . I don't think it should be taken as a sign that the military is on the . verge of stepping in and taking back the reins of government,' he added. It seemed unlikely that Sisi was signalling the army wants to take . back the power it held for six decades since the end of the colonial era . and through an interim period after the overthrow of former air force . chief Hosni Mubarak two years ago. But his message sent a powerful . message that Egypt's biggest institution, with a huge economic as well . as security role and a recipient of massive direct U.S. subsidies, is . worried about the fate of the nation, after five days of turmoil in . major cities. 'The continuation of the struggle of the different . political forces ... over the management of state affairs could lead to . the collapse of the state,' said General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is . also defence minister in the government Mursi appointed. He said . the economic, political and social challenges facing the country . represented 'a real threat to the security of Egypt and the cohesiveness . of the Egyptian state' and the army would remain 'the solid and . cohesive block' on which the state rests. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that one of the primary goals of deploying troops in cities on the Suez Canal was to protect the waterway that is vital for Egypt's economy and world trade . Sisi was picked by Mursi after the army handed over power to the new president in June once Mursi had sacked Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, in charge of Egypt during the transition and who had also been Mubarak's defence minister for 20 years. Since the 2011 revolt, Islamists who Mubarak spent his 30-year rule . suppressing have won two referendums, two parliamentary elections and a . presidential vote. But that legitimacy has been challenged by an opposition that accuses . Mursi of imposing a new form of authoritarianism. Mursi's supporters . says protesters want to overthrow Egypt's first ever democratically . elected leader by undemocratic means. The instability has provoked unease in Western capitals, where officials . worry about the direction of a powerful regional player that has a . peace deal with Israel. The United States condemned the bloodshed and . called on Egyptian leaders to make clear violence was not acceptable.

A heart-warming moment was brought to tragedy-hit Newtown, Connecticut, last night when their High School basketball team scored a breathtaking 3-point shot on the buzzer to win their final home game of the season. The Nighthawks, Newtown High School's basketball team, were trailing by a point in their Senior Night game when guard Mike Daubert landed the miracle shot just as the final buzzer was heard. A video of the shot swept the internet last night and led to the 17-year-old's moment of triumph being voted number 1 moment of ESPN’s SportsCenter Top 10 plays - beating Kobe Bryant's dunk against the Brooklyn Nets into number 2. On the buzzer: Mike Daubert scored an amazing three pointer for the Newtown Nighthawks against New Milford last night . Basketball hero: Mike Daubert, right, was photographed with his basketball hero Knicks player Carmelo Anthony last week. The New York team traveled to Newtown last Tuesday for a 'day of fun'. It comes a week after several members of the senior team, including Daubert, were able to meet the New York Knicks who visited the town to show their solidarity following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary. Daubert now proudly displays a picture of himself alongside Carmelo Anthony as his Twitter profile picture. Following the visit the star forward told ESPN: 'We went out there (and) it was just good to see a lot of people . smile all over again. Just to be doing the things that we were doing -- . playing the games, playing basketball with them, just making people . smile and feel happy about themselves.' Coach Tim Tallcouch told the Oklahoman how important the team's visit to the town had been for young people in the area. 'Between myself, the town of Newtown and the NY Knicks organization, the Knicks Garden of Dreams Foundation, player, coaches, executives and dancers came to Newtown CT yesterday and put many smiles on the faces of the Sandy Hook Elementary kids with two hours of a fun clinic/event. Simply AMAZING!!! It really does make a difference.' Long-shot: The video shows Mike Daubert launching the last second shot in front of a poster bearing his name . It's in!

At their opening home game of the season the Nighthawks wore warm-up sweaters with Sandy Hook Elementary printed on the front with the words Never Forgotten on the back above a number 26. Coach Tallcouch who also teaches chemistry told the The Hour Sports Podcast: 'Things will never be the same as far as Newtown is concerned. We as teachers are going to face one of the biggest challenges trying to get these kids to feel comfortable again learning in the classroom.

Fidel Castro has made a rare public appearance after he voted in the country's parliamentary elections. Millions of Cubans joined the 86-year-old former leader of Cuba to vote in what critics have branded a 'closed' election that offers no real competition. The revolutionary icon, who appears in public only occasionally now since he fell ill in 2006, was among those voting in Havana yesterday. Scroll down for video . Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro cast his vote for the general election in a school polling station in Havana . Government critics call Cuban elections perfunctory, noting that only the Communist Party is permitted on the island . The government has defended the process, saying it is a show of grass-roots democracy. Authorities say the lack of multiple . parties or political campaigning keeps corruption and special-interest . money out of elections, and point to high turnout as proof that it's a . participatory system. The elected unicameral legislature will meet on February 24 and pick a new parliament chief for the first time in two decades, with the body's longtime leader, Ricardo Alarcon, not on the ballot. The body is also expected to rename Raul Castro, whom state TV showed casting his ballot in the eastern province of Santiago, as president for another five years. Voting began last October with municipal elections. Term limits do not exist in Cuba, but on various occasions Castro has proposed limiting public officials including the president to two consecutive periods in office. Castro, who now appears in public only occasionally after his illness, was among more than 8 million islanders eligible to vote . Castro and his younger brother Raul have headed up the government for five decades . Government critics call Cuban elections perfunctory, noting that only the Communist Party is permitted on the island and only one approved candidate is on the ballot for each seat in parliament. Castro and his older brother Fidel, now retired, have headed up the government for five decades.

'Personally I find it is more democratic than (others) I know.' More than 8 million islanders are eligible to vote, and will approve 612 members of the National Assembly and over 1,600 provincial delegates.

When MTV Cribs hit the screens giving us a glimpse behind the doors of the homes of the rich and famous, property porn was born. And it seems that Britain is a nation addicted. Over 80 per cent of men and women admit they regularly look in estate agent windows and 74 per cent check property websites for homes that are beyond their budget. Property porn is the new addiction and the UK is hooked . A third also conceded they have made an enquiry with an estate agent, and a further 20 per cent have even arranged to view a property they have no intention of purchasing or renting. Addiction to property porn also appears to be rife within British neighbourhoods, with a surprising, 38 per cent of people confessing they make a habit out of snooping through their neighbours windows to get a glance at their decor. Even more shockingly, a fifth of respondents say they have even gone as far as trespassing on someone else's property to get a proper look at their home or garden. Of these 12 per cent have almost or actually been arrested, and a further 25 per cent have been given a telling off by the owner. Property TV shows have put mansions on the map, and viewers can't get enough . It seems that the nation’s addiction to property porn is also borne out by the popularity of watching television property shows, with 77 per cent of Britons admitting it is one of their guilty pleasures. When quizzed about what their number one purchase would be if they win the lottery, 54 per cent answered a luxury home, while an additional 26 per cent said they would be more inclined to buy a property if they knew a former owner was a celebrity. The findings from the Home TV channel survey also reveal that 57 per cent of Brits dream of moving home abroad and leaving the UK behind, citing their top reasons as wanting to live in a warmer climate (37 per cent), having a better quality of life (28 per cent), or getting a change in scenery (10 per cent). 20 per cent of Brits have even arranged to view a property they have no intention of purchasing or renting . When it comes to the country that most appeals to Britons prepared to move abroad the USA came out top for 19 per cent, followed by Australia (16 per cent), and Spain (14 per cent). The survey also asked what they imagined their ideal dream home would be like if money was no object for almost a third an old manor house was the preference, followed by a Mediterranean style villa for 31 per cent and a brand new grand mansion for 21 per cent.

The death toll from cancer has fallen over the past decade, official figures showed yesterday. Earlier diagnosis and better treatment have seen the rate drop by an average of 9.5 per cent since 2001. A decline in smoking was also cited as a factor because tobacco causes cancer of the lung as well as other forms of the disease including breast, bowel, liver, throat and mouth. The chance of dying from cancer is still greater however in Britain than in some other European countries. A recent report has shown that the number of women dying from ovarian cancer - one of the most aggressive types - had fallen by a quarter in a decade . Among women the death rates are the third highest in Northern Europe and worse than in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The 2011 figures from the Office for National Statistics show that death rates for men have fallen by 10.9 per cent since 2001. On average, 204 die from cancer per 100,000 of the male population each year. In 2001 the toll was 229. In women the rates have fallen by 7.5 per cent, from 161 to 149  deaths per 100,000 each year. The average decline for both sexes was 9.5 per cent. ‘The good news is that as individuals our risk of dying from the disease has fallen,’ said Catherine Thomson, head of statistics at  Cancer Research UK. ‘The reduction in people smoking has helped hugely for many cancers, and we’re better at diagnosing some cancers earlier. We’re also better at treating many cancers, with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as developing more  tailored personalised medicine.’ Countries with the worst cancer survival rates in Northern Europe . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘It is encouraging to see figures moving in the right direction with overall deaths falling, but there is more we can do to make sure that our cancer services are world class and that NHS patients receive the best treatment available.’ Of the ten countries included in Northern Europe, only Denmark and Ireland recorded higher figures for cancer death rates in women. Death rates for men were fifth out of the ten states across Northern Europe. Around 320,500 Britons are diagnosed with cancer a year and 157,000 patients die. Breast:     48788 . Lung:        41428 . Bowel:      41142 . Prostate:  40841 . Latest annual figures (2009) from Cancer Research UK . Last month a report showed that the . number of women dying from ovarian cancer – one of the most aggressive . types – had fallen by a quarter in a decade. Death rates have always been higher in men than women and researchers believe this may be because they have poorer lifestyles. In . 2009, figures from Cancer Research UK showed that men were 60 per cent . more likely to get cancer and 70 per cent more likely to die from it.Experts from the charity said  that there was no obvious reason except that men tended to be less ‘health conscious’. They also said it may be that men had a ‘stiff upper lip’ and were more reluctant to see their GP if unwell.","Around 320,000 people Britons are diagnosed each year .

Agatha Christie found herself at the centre of a mystery of her own making when she appeared to give away one of Britain’s biggest wartime secrets in a thriller. MI5 got into a panic after her 1941 novel N or M? featured a character called ‘Major Bletchley’ – a fact that seemed to reveal the existence of codebreaking centre Bletchley Park. Christie was a close friend of Alfred Dilwyn Knox, a leading codebreaker, so the secret service was very concerned at the apparent give-away. The novel featured Christie’s detective duo Tommy and Tuppence – married couple Thomas and Prudence Beresford – who fearlessly tracked down German spies in Britain. In the novel they met Major Bletchley, an old Indian Army major who claimed to know everything about what was really going on in the war. MI5 believed that the character’s inside knowledge of the progress of the war was based on the Bletchley codebreakers’ knowledge of German plans. Codebreakers at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, had broken the German Enigma machine ciphers, allowing British commanders to intercept Nazi messages. The Germans believed their Enigma code was completely unbreakable, so it was vital to ensure only a very few people knew what was going on at Bletchley. Christie’s novels sold tens of thousands at the time so MI5 was anxious to ﬁnd out exactly what she might know. They questioned Knox, who insisted that she could not possibly know about Enigma. The Germans believed their Enigma code was unbreakable, so it was vital to ensure only a few knew about Bletchley Park . Investigators were afraid that if they questioned Christie it was bound to get out, so Knox agreed to ask her himself. He had to be careful what he said to avoid giving anything away, but he invited her to his home at Courn’s Wood, Naphill, Buckinghamshire. Over tea and scones he asked her why she had chosen to name her character Major Bletchley. She replied: ‘Bletchley? My dear, I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.’ It seemed MI5 had panicked over nothing. The story is told in a new book, The Codebreakers of Station X.","Fears Major Bletchley was based on codebreaking centre Bletchley Park .

From Catholicism to the Qur'an, the majority of religions have a code of rules for followers to practice. And now philosopher Alain de Botton has created a set of 10 new rules for atheists. The best-selling author said he was unveiling his Manifesto for Atheists in an attempt to promote overlooked virtues including resilience and humour. De Botton, whose work includes a stint as a writer in residence at Heathrow Airport, said he came up with the idea in response to a growing sense that being virtuous had become 'a strange and depressing notion', while wickedness and evil had a 'peculiar kind of glamour'. He said: 'There's no scientific answer to being virtuous, but the key thing is to have some kind of list on which to flex our ethical muscles. 'It reminds us that we all need to work at being good, just as we work at anything else that really matters.' The 43-year-old writer, who once summarised Marcel Proust's work as a guide on how to lead better lives, compiled a list that atheists can look to as a moral compass. He emphasizes the importance of being polite which is linked to tolerance, and how sacrifice is essential for a happy family life. The 10 rules for atheists are: . 1. Resilience. Keeping going even when things are looking dark. 2. Empathy. The capacity to connect imaginatively with the sufferings and unique experiences of another person. 3. Patience. We should grow calmer and more forgiving by getting more realistic about how things actually tend to go. The writer says that like anger, humour comes from disappointment, but it's disappointment optimally channelled . 4. Sacrifice. We won't ever manage to . raise a family, love someone else or save the planet if we don't keep up . with the art of sacrifice. 5. Politeness. Politeness is very linked to tolerance, the capacity to . live alongside people whom one will never agree with, but at the same . time, can't avoid. 6. Humour. Like anger, humour springs from disappointment, but it's disappointment optimally channelled. 7. Self-Awareness. To know oneself is to try not to blame others for one's troubles and moods; to have a sense of what's going on inside oneself, and what actually belongs to the world. 8. Forgiveness. It's recognising that living with others isn't possible without excusing errors. 9. Hope. Pessimism isn't necessarily deep, nor optimism shallow. 10. Confidence. Confidence isn't arrogance, it's based on a constant awareness of how short life is and how little we ultimately lose from risking everything.","Hope and sacrifice can lead to a happier life, says writer Alain de Botton .

Obesity costs the state £5bn a year (stock photo) Thousands of people who say they are too fat to work are costing taxpayers nearly £30m a year, new figures show. Statistics issued by the Department for Work and Pensions show that a total of 7,080 people claimed £29.3m sickness benefits for obesity in the year to April 2012. Critics said it was time 'people took responsibility for their actions', as it emerged that the number of people claiming they were too obese to work had doubled in three years. Obesity costs the taxpayer more than £5bn a year, with many obese people relying on benefits entirely, as well as needing expensive healthcare, equipment and carers. The Government is keen to cut the enormous welfare bill, which comprises payments made under the Disability Living Allowance, Severe Disability Living Allowance, and Employment and Support Allowance. April will see the introduction of the the Personal Independence Payment for those 'of working age', ie aged between 16-64.  It will replace the Disability Living Allowance and will be paid out only after a face-to-face consultation with a trained assessor. Six out of ten people will have their benefits reduced or even stopped as ministers try to drive down the benefits bill. The new DWP statistics, which were released in response to a Freedom of Information request, showed that last year's incapacity benefit bill topped £22bn - an increase of £1.4bn from the previous year. The constituency with the highest number of people claiming incapacity benefits is Knowsley on Merseyside, where 21,6000 receive payments.  Next up was Glasgow East with 19,830 and then Walton, Liverpool, with 19,360. Birmingham also had high numbers of claimants, along with Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Rhondda Valley and Sunderland. Going up: Britain is the obesity capital of Europe, with one in four adults classed as obese (stock photo) Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Obesity is costing taxpayers dear. Tackling the problem early is vital as it's not fair on the claimant or other taxpayers that someone is allowed to become dependent on benefits because of their weight. 'Ultimately people have to take responsibility for their actions and show they are taking steps to get back to work. For too long the benefits system has been quick to write people off and put them on the sick. This has to stop.' In October 2011 the Government launched a Call to Action campaign to tackle obesity and reduce the nation's calorie intake by 2020. Ministers called on food producers to cut the calories in food and drink, and to help people make healthier choices. Too fat to work: Paul Mason had to quit his job as a postman when he could no longer deliver letters . Paul Mason, 51, from Ipswich, had to give up his job as a postman when he became too fat to complete his delivery rounds. He says a compulsive eating disorder made him eat ten times more food than he needed until he was unable to walk or even stand, and had to be cared for full-time at home. At the height of his weight problems he ate about 20,000 calories a day, weighed 70 stone, and needed a specially-built bungalow provided for him by the council. When Mr Mason became ill, firefighters had to knock down a wall in his house and use a forklift truck to get him to hospital.

An American woman has been granted a divorce from her Chinese entrepreneur husband in a high-profile case which highlighted the problem of domestic violence in China. Kim Lee, 40, posted graphic photos of the injuries she said were caused by her husband Li Yang on her Sina Weibo account, the Chinese version of Twitter, before she filed for divorce. With almost 70,000 followers, Lee's first hand experiences of domestic violence at the hands of her husband Li Yang, split the nation. Unlikely hero: Kim Lee, centre, wife of Crazy English founder has been granted a divorce from her husband on grounds of domestic abuse . Brave: The photos of Kim Lee's injuries showing a bump on her forehead and bleeding ear went viral . Some felt she was right to go public while others believed she should have kept the abuse secret. Yang is the multi-millionaire owner of 'Crazy English', a chain of English-teaching schools which are a household name in China. The photos of the bump on her forehead, bruises on her knees and a bleeding ear went viral and sparked tens of thousands of postings on Chinese Twitter-like sites, along with protests and talk show debates. She inadvertently became a hero for women who have been victims of domestic violence because it is a subject not often talked about in China, where tradition holds family conflicts to be private. It is also hard to go public in a country where many still consider women subservient to their husbands. Kim Lee, wife of 'Crazy English' founder Li Yang, went public with claims she was the victim of domestic abuse at the hands of her husband . But on Sunday a Beijing court granted the divorce on the grounds of domestic abuse and the court approved Lee's request for a three-month restraining order against Li. Reports said the court ordered Li to pay his former wife 50,000 yuan (£6,000) compensation for mental anguish as well as child support. She will also have custody of their three daughters and receive properties worth more than 12million yuan (£1.2million). Separation:  Kim Lee (left) preparing divorce papers and her former husband Li Yang (right) A spokeswoman from the Chaoyang District People's Court confirmed the divorce but wouldn't give any details. The China Daily quoted Lee's lawyer, Qi Lianfeng, as saying that the court's acknowledgement of the domestic violence will encourage more women 'to protect their rights in a legal way.' Lee said she would continue to live with her children in China because her daughters have been educated here, the China Daily reported. It is estimated that at least one in four women has experienced beatings at the hands of their husband in China and abuse thrives in a culture of secrecy that holds family conflicts private. The expectation that all men are violent — or at least have the right to be violent — is common in parts of China. As with many countries, men historically ruled the family, with authority over women and girls. Communism brought new laws that gave women the right to work alongside men, and decades of economic growth have created dramatic shifts in Chinese society. But inequities persist, particularly in rural areas.","Kim Lee posted graphic photos of her injuries on the internet which she said were caused by her multi-millionaire husband Li Yang .

The Metropolitan Police has received more than £5million over three years from passing on the details of traffic accidents to victims' insurance companies and lawyers, it emerged today. It is legal for details of incidents to be given to other service providers, if they have been granted the victim's permission and act on their behalf. This information is then used for pursue compensation claims by lawyers for the victims. The Metropolitan Police has received more than £5million since 2009. Hampshire Constabulary has been paid more than £480,000 since 2010, and Fife Constabulary £194,000. Accident: It is legal for accident reports to be passed on to other service providers if those firms are acting with the consent of the victim (file picture) A Freedom of Information Act request was made by insurers LV= Liverpool Victoria, who said one in five victims reported they were encouraged to claim compensation by a police officer. Legislation due to be implemented this April will see a ban on the payment and receipt of referral fees in personal injury cases. It will also cap lawyers' fees on successful claims. LV= said that this legalisation has prompted a whiplash 'gold rush' and added that claims companies are now hounding people regardless of whether they have been injured or not. One in 20 road accident victims are contacted by a claims company within two hours of a crash, a survey showed. The research found that six per cent of victims were approached by lawyers within two hours and almost half within 24 hours. One in four claimants said they would not have sought compensation without third party intervention. Firms are even approaching victims at the roadside and in hospital, the report found. Information transfer: The Metropolitan Police has received more than £5million for reproducing accident reports since 2009 . It said that the number of people who have been contacted following an accident has increased by 52 per cent since 2010 to two thirds of victims - despite accident rates falling. 'The heavy-handed tactics of the “claims farming” industry has resulted in record levels of compensation claims for whiplash and other personal injuries - despite falling accident rates' John O'Roarke, LV= . The poll found that 13 per cent of those encouraged to make a claim were approached at the roadside, with ten per cent targeted at an information desk set up in a hospital. LV= said that many are persistently pursued in the weeks after, with one victim reporting that he was contacted a whopping 340 times following his accident and hounded to make a claim. Almost a third of those who made a claim admitted they exaggerated their injury to get compensation and a further one in ten said they made up the injury entirely to get the money. John O'Roarke, managing director of LV= car insurance, said: ‘The heavy-handed tactics of the “claims farming” industry has resulted in record levels of compensation claims for whiplash and other personal injuries - despite falling accident rates. Explanation: Scotland Yard said it did not sell details to compensation lawyers or claims management firms, and the money they were given was simply to cover their costs of providing the details . ‘Crash victims are being aggressively targeted by those who can make money out of their details and they are literally hounding them to make a claim within moments of an accident. 'As would be expected, every road traffic collision is investigated by police to see whether any offences have taken place and reports are filed as appropriate' Metropolitan Police spokesman . ‘Those tempted to make a claim when they do not have an injury should think again as making a fraudulent claim could lead to a hefty fine or prison sentence.’ Scotland Yard said it did not sell any contact details to compensation lawyers or claims management firms. The money they were given was simply to cover their costs of providing the details to firms acting on behalf of victims. ‘Every road traffic collision is investigated by police to see whether any offences have taken place and reports are filed as appropriate,’ a spokesman said. 'As is standard practice across the police service nationally, copies of these reports and associated documents are provided on request to solicitors and insurance companies acting on behalf of individuals involved in the collisions in order for insurance claims to be settled. 'This is carried out for an administrative fee.' Forces in Fife and Hampshire also said the fees received were to cover costs.","Metropolitan Police has received £5million in administration fees since 2009 .

'Bizarre': Omar Ali, 23, offered takeaway staff a gun as payment for a fish and chips meal . A 23-year-old man who tried to pay for his fish and chips dinner with a gun has been jailed for seven months. Omar Ali did not threaten the staff at the Podsmead fish and chip shop in Gloucester with the imitation firearm - but instead offered it as payment for the meal. When staff refused to accept the gun as payment, Ali tried to exchange it at another store before he was arrested by police. Prosecutor Julian Kesner told the court: ‘This is a strange matter. ‘He went into the Podsmead fish and chip shop and appeared to want to exchange a gun for money. He effectively wanted to swap it.’ Gloucester Crown Court heard staff refused the gun and Ali left to try his luck elsewhere. ‘Later that evening, at 7pm, he went into the Premier Convenience Store and asked for alcohol on credit. He was refused. ‘He went back to the till and showed his waistband. In the waistband there appeared to be a handgun. ‘He leaned over the counter and put the gun on the shelf under the till and offered it in payment. ‘The cashier picked up the gun and put it on the counter. The defendant picked it up and put it back in his waistband. ‘When he was arrested two imitation handguns were found in his home.’ Ali was also charged with assaulting his girlfriend, Miss Boon, in a separate incident. Mr Kesner said Ali had been drinking all day when his girlfriend told him she was going out to see a friend. The court heard Ali told her 'You're not going out' and he scuffled with her, causing her to fall to the floor. Food outlet: Staff at the Podsmead Fish and Chips takeaway in Gloucester refused to accept the firearm . Mr Kesner said: 'She put her arm up and he bit it, leaving marks on her arm. 'She says he then produced a knife . and held it in front of her, threatening to stab her unless she went and . sat back down. She was screaming and a neighbour called the police.' Ali, of Byron Avenue, Podsmead, . Gloucester, admitted charges of possessing an imitation firearm, common . assault on his partner in a separate incident, and motoring offences . including having no insurance and failing to stop after an accident. Jailing him, Judge William Hart . described the case as bizarre story but accepted that Ali was trying to . give the weapon to shop staff as payment. And . while the gun was extremely authentic in appearance, Judge Hart told . the court it was not actually capable of causing real harm. He added: ‘However, although there are no aggravating features there must be an immediate prison term, albeit a short one. ‘It . is important that everyone realises that any possession of even an . imitation firearm in a public place - especially one as authentic . looking as this - requires custody.’ Judge .

The judge ordered six points on Ali’s driving licence . for his motoring offences.

A childless couple smuggled an African baby into Britain and tried to pass him off as their own. When confronted by the authorities, they admitted the newborn was not theirs but claimed he had been rescued from a rubbish bin. Kacou Miessan, 44, and his  wife Raymonde, 39, had unsuccessfully undergone IVF treatment  after trying to conceive for more than 13 years. Mrs Miessan visited her native Sierra Leone for several months last year and mysteriously returned with the baby, Canterbury Crown Court heard. She had registered the boy’s birth there and, as a French national, was able to get him a passport. The couple named the boy Matys –which means ‘gift from God’ – and began a new life in Ashford, Kent. But the wife had never been pregnant, James Bilsland, prosecuting, told the court. When eight weeks later the couple fell out with a relative, the authorities learned that the child had been brought into the UK illegally and he was taken into care. Mrs Miessan told police that her mother had found the child in a street bin, his umbilical cord still attached, and offered it to her. The couple said they had wanted to save Matys and give him a ‘good life’. They admitted smuggling the child into the UK using fake documents and were jailed for a year. Christopher Harding, defending Mrs Miessan, said: ‘Because of the failure of the IVF treatment this was in effect an act of desperation.’ The court heard she had told investigators: ‘We did it to help him. We are sorry we didn’t do it by the rules. We intended to give something good back by giving Matys a good life.’ She told police that, if she could . have, she would have tried to ‘save’ more abandoned children by . smuggling them into the UK. Her husband added: ‘Matys was everything to . us. I wanted the best for him. The couple, who said the boy was a 'gift from God' were jailed for 12 months at Canterbury Crown Court . ‘We didn’t do this to harm Matys, to . do something wrong. It is true we didn’t do it the right way but we . didn’t want to deceive anyone. ‘For us it was Matys, it’s not like we did it for some kind of return, to claim some benefits.’ The baby has been taken into care and a court has ruled that he is to be put up for adoption.

Binmen have been blasted by a great grandmother after they refused to move her one-wheeled bin for health and safety reasons - even though she managed it. Widow Anne Hobson, 71, who suffers from asthma and osteo-arthritis dragged the broken bin 50 feet down her driveway for it to be collected. But because its right wheel had broken off, refuse collectors declined to wheel it just a few feet to their truck. Anne Hobson's binmen refused to empty her wheelie bin for health and safety reasons after one of its wheels fell off . Retired bookkeeper Mrs Hobson, from Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester said: 'It's unbelievable that I can drag the bin 50ft to the end of my driveway, but able-bodied men can't take it from the kerbside and have it emptied into the wagon just a few feet away. 'I think they're just lazy and being jobsworths. It seems to me they want the job done for them and they can't be bothered.' The incident occurred on Friday after Mrs Hobson took her full bin out for collection as usual only for its wheel to fall off as she dragged it down her driveway. She added: 'I was just putting the bin out like I normally do for the bin men and the wheel came off. I've had that same bin for thirty years, the wheel just fell off due to wear and tear. 'It was still there when everyone else's had been collected. They never even came to tell me why they couldn't collect it and there was no note left on the bin. 'I couldn't believe it, I have never heard anything so ridiculous in my life. Thirty years ago they used to carry the bins on their backs and they didn't even have wheels then, there's none of that now, all they need to do now is drag it a couple of feet. If it's due to health and safety, they've all gone mad. 'I managed to drag that heavy bin all that way a despite being old and only 5ft1 these young 6ft strong men couldn't pull it a couple of feet. It's crazy. 'I have been doing this every week and I've never heard of such nonsense. Anne Hobson will be left without a rubbish collection until a new bin arrives to replace her broken wheelie bin . Damaged: Anne Hobson dragged the one-wheeled bin 50ft despite suffering from asthma and osteo-arthritis . 'When we called the council they didn't want to know, it's just an excuse and there was no reasoning with the council when we got on to them.' 'They told me they couldn't pick it up for a week and when I said it would be overflowing with rubbish they told me to leave it in bags next to the bin. 'The thing is if anyone was to leave bags they would just not collect them and we would be in the same situation. 'I have two cats and don't want that rubbish leaving on the floor. It's only Monday but I dread to think what it's going to be like on Friday, because it will have accumulated. It's ludicrous. 'To say that no one can come out of all those men who work for Bolton Council is simply appalling. They are just being lazy, obviously it is too much trouble for these able bodied and burly men. 'I can't say they have been very helpful about the situation, anyone would have thought that I'd pulled the wheel off myself. I've had that bin for thirty years, the council are just trying to cop out and are using any excuse not to do their jobs.' Mrs Hobson's son Andrew said: 'It's absolutely ridiculous that a 71-year-old woman can drag a bin with one wheel to the end of her long driveway when 6ft tall, 15-stone binmen can't empty it. 'And I'm also upset that she won't get another bin earlier. It seems to be all about what suits them.' Bolton Council have offered to a supply a new grey bin free of charge. A spokesman said: 'The bin was not emptied due to the missing wheel. 'It will be replaced free of charge next Friday, the delivery day for this area, and any excess waste will also be removed next Friday.'","Anne Hobson, 71, is asthmatic and arthritic but dragged broken bin herself .

Shocking: CCTV captured the moment when the blue Vauxhall Zafira hatchback clattered into the front garden and then into the house in Bolton, Greater Manchester, last July before the vehicle burst into flames . As onlookers looked in in horror McGarry got out of the blazing vehicle before saying: ‘I couldn't have hoped for it to go any better. She's not having the house.’ But he was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after it emerged his wife and the couple's three children were in fact inside the house at the time. Their six-year-old son was in the front living room watching TV when the car ploughed into the house, but although the lounge window caught fire no-one was injured. Mrs McGarry managed to usher the children out of the back door. At Bolton Crown Court, her husband admitted arson with the intent to endanger life and was jailed for eight years. Caught on camera: At 7pm on July 24 last year, Andrew McGarry ploughed the family Zafira into the house . McGarry - who said he had intended to kill himself - carried out his kamikaze style motoring mission after leading a public campaign for better road safety in the area. Pictured: At Bolton Crown Court, Andrew McGarry admitted arson with the intent to endanger life and was jailed for eight years . Earlier the court heard how the couple met in 2005 and they married the following year after the birth of the first of their three children, now aged six, four and two. McGarry already had two older children from a previous relationship. But the marriage crumbled amid allegations of domestic violence and Mrs McGarry was granted a non-molestation order last June prohibiting her husband from contacting her. The following month he breached it by driving near her house and getting an intermediary to take a letter to her. After being warned, McGarry snapped and at 7pm on July 24 last year, he ploughed the family Zafira into the house. The court heard he had not . checked whether anyone was inside the house before setting light to the . passenger footwell of the car. After . the fire, Mrs McGarry discovered a house insurance policy had been . cancelled leaving her unable to fully repair the damage, which includes . needing to replace the front window and rebuilding the garden wall. McGarry . also admitted breaching a non-molestation order and was made subject of . an indefinite restraining order prohibiting him from having any contact . with his wife, their children or going near the house. She is now in . the process of divorcing him. Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Clayson . told McGarry: ‘You were plainly deeply frustrated, angry and annoyed at . the break-up of your marriage.

Smashed in: Their six-year-old son was in the front living room watching TV when the car ploughed into the house, but although the lounge window caught fire no-one was injured . ‘Your comments at the scene are a further indication of the fixation you had in seeking to inflict damage on your former wife. ‘It is clear to me you are someone with a very controlling, rigid, personality which results in your putting your own interests, feelings and desires ahead of those of others.’ 'I couldn't have hoped for it to go any better. She's not having the house' What Andrew McGarry said after crashing car into family home . McGarry, who runs his own design and architect firm, had campaigned for better road safety in his area after his daughter - then aged two - was knocked down by a car outside their home in September 2010. She survived the impact and made a full recovery but McGarry collected a petition with more than 200 signatures and raised £500 towards a survey to examine better speed restrictions in the area. As a result mobile speed checks were carried out on the busy road. McGarry set up Facebook and Twitter pages for his firm based at the house but gave no inkling of any troubles at home - posting messages about his work designing loft and garage conversions.","Andrew McGarry, 37, ploughed car into his £120,000 end-terraced house .

A childcare company in New York is offering families the chance to hire armed US military war veterans as nannies to 'keep tragedy from happening', months after two children were stabbed to death in the bath by their carer. The no-nonsense nannies, which cost at least $1,500 a week, are as adept at changing a nappy as they are at reloading a semiautomatic weapon, said Tactical Nanny founder Jonathan Gilliam, a former Navy SEAL and New York City counter-terrorism expert for the FBI. Gilliam, who is currently recruiting female applicants for the role, said he was inspired by the tragic case of Marina and Kevin Krim, whose two and six-year-old children were murdered by their carer in a horrific crime that shocked America last October. Tragedy: In October last year, Kevin and Marina Krim's two-year-old son Leo, centre, and his six-year-old sister Lucia, right, were murdered at the family's Upper West Side home in October in an horrific crime that shocked America . Smiling: Kevin and Marina Krim have revealed how their surviving daughter Nessie, left, is helping them deal with the agony of the murder of her siblings Leo, 2, right, and Lucia, 6, centre . 'That family even went down to the Dominican Republic thinking they were screening the nanny, but they didn’t really know who she was,' Gilliam told the New York post. 'We’re not just offering another nanny service,' he added. 'These women have a proven track record. They’re veterans protecting the future of the USA. They can keep tragedy from happening. You’re paying for the peace of mind.' The former lieutenant - who once served in the Navy's special operations force, the division that took out Osama bin Laden - said his nannies are trained to spot and handle threats with the speed and precision that no untrained carer would. Horror: Marina and Kevin Krim pictured before the tragedy. Mrs Krim's screams could be heard through the building after she found her stabbed children . Happy children: Mrs Krim arrived home at the family apartment to find two of her two children dead in the bath-tub next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt . He has already hired a number of childminders, including Melissa Fraga, an army reservist specialising in enemy tracking and mission communications as well as being a top-level first aider. 'Let’s say a nanny would freak out if she hears sounds around her,' she told the post. 'I’d . be able to see the situation, figure out where the noise is coming from, . check around the house and then do whatever other steps I need.' He said all his nannies will come with a full background check and military records that reveal any problems, such as post traumatic stress during their service. He is also consulting a psychologist to help match his employees' profiles with that of interested families. Single mother and investment banker Kathleen Histon, 45, told the paper that she was ready to sign up adding that, with their training and security clearance, 'you really know the quality of the person you bring into your home...

A three-year-old girl allegedly spent the night locked in a freezing South African jail cell with her father, barefoot and only  wearing her pyjamas. Cherise Niemann was so traumatised by her ordeal, on January 6, that she has been receiving counselling ever since to help control panic attacks brought on whenever she sees a policeman. Upon arrival to the police station in Hazyview, Johannesburg, officers even denied the hysterical toddler a drink of water and refused to take her home or allow her father to call somebody to pick her up, her parents claim. Instead, they say, she was forced to sleep in a cold, bare holding cell with her father as the unfamiliar sound of slamming doors, clanging chains and abusive drunks echoed throughout the police station. Scary: Charlie Niemann, 29, said he was arrested for drink driving on January 6 and both he and his daughter Cherise were locked in a freezing police cell overnight . Now her father, Charlie, has branded the arresting officers 'inhuman' and has demanded answers as to why his daughter was exposed to such horrors that would haunt the dreams of even the most confident of toddlers. Her ordeal began when police stopped Niemann, 29, on suspicion of drink driving as he took his . daughter out to buy milk and cigarettes. He claims that, after his arrest, police officers took them both to the station for interview, refusing to take Cherise home or allow him to call for someone to pick her up. He admits to having drunk two beers earlier in the night but denies that he was drunk when he took the youngster out in the car. He said: 'It was terrible. My child was hysterical. The officials were inhuman. Fears: According to Cherise's mother Stephanie, 30, who was pregnant with the couple¿s second child, the youngster is now terrified of police officers . Complaint: Mr Niemann claims that after being arrested police officers refused to take Cherise home or allow him to call for someone to pick her up . 'They even refused to give her water.

Getting an allotment is supposed to be the start of the 'Good Life' - as you begin growing your own cheap and healthy vegetables. But the recent surge in popularity of allotments has apparently been accompanied by rocketing disagreements between plotholders. And those dreaming of leading an idyllically self-sufficient life should be warned that those 'disagreements' can even extend from the deliberate sabotage of vegetables, to poisoning in water barrels, and even arson attacks on greenhouses. New figures show that getting closer to nature not a guaranteed escape from rivalry and territorial arguments . According to the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners, it was called to step in to an astonishing 3,500 disputes last year. The rise in rows seems directly linked to the recent growth in popularity of the hobby - sparked by both the recession, soaring supermarket prices and the increasing popularity of homegrown ingredients for cooking - which has led to a cut in size of some council plots. And with more allotment holders rubbing shoulders, it seems they are increasingly ready to ball their green fingers into angry fists. As well as simply having less space to move in, it seems modern-plot holders are more likely to anger others by erecting huge sheds, or controversial additions such as bee hives. All this, on top of the traditional rivalry between gardeners desperate to grow the biggest cauliflower or carrot in the area. There are 350,000 allotment-holders in Britain - with a record 150,000 more on waiting lists, which can be 40 years long. Many newcomers to the hobby have been inspired by TV chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. In Cheltenham in Gloucestershire the demand for plots is said to have trebled since 2009. As a result the number of tenants has increased from 555 to 814, with the council said to have cut the size of some plots to accommodate the rise in demand. Classic seventies show The Good Life starring Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal as Tom and Barbara Good, satirised the many woes of growing your own vegetables . Problems have been reported nationwide. In Torquay, the chairman of the local allotment holders' association Tony Mason, 70, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Someone who has a grudge against me has been breaking into my shed. 'They aren't taking anything, they just move things around, as some sort of warning. The attacks aren't random, they only go after the chairman and other committee members.' Mr Mason claimed a garden ornament owned by his wife Janet had even been moved by his mystery enemies to send him a sinister message. 'They've done it just to say, ""If we want to get into your shed we can"",' he said. 'I'd rather they just came and told me if they have a problem with the way things are run.' He said the situation was so bad he had to grow his top crops at a new secret location - and said another member of the allotment committee had his tomatoes wiped out when weedkiller was put in his water tank. Another committee member had his water tank poisoned with weedkiller, which ruined a tomato crop. In Oldham, Lancashire, gardening newcomer Ben Carcamo, 28, claimed he suffered from failing out with the allotment committee - and was told to vacate his plot simply because it was more vital than rivals'. The local council stepped in to say he could stay - but he said he could not face returning, the animosity was so great. Mr Carcamo said: 'My pumpkins are the biggest on the allotment because my land, which was left untended for eight years, is so fertile. 'I thought owning an allotment was going to be idyllic, harmonious, but it couldn't be more different. When I joined, someone actually warned me, ""It's not like Alan Titchmarsh here"".' In 2007 only 2.9 per cent of all food consumed in the home was self-produced - but by 2011 it was 5 per cent.","Growth in rows linked to the recent growth in popularity of the hobby .

Boasting top designer labels like Bvlgari, Gucci, Barbour and Ugg, this Aladdin's cave of classic bling would sell on Britain's high street for £10m - if it were real. In fact, everything in this picture is fake, having been created in sweat shops in China by workers earning around 30p an hour. Today three men were starting jail sentences for their part in what police described as a 'highly profitable criminal venture' importing and selling fake designer goods. All fake: This treasure trove of coveted labels including Bvlgari, Barbour and Gucci would be worth £10m if real . Mahmood Shah, 44, Agha Khan, 27, and Sarwari Dlague, 33, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud at Manchester's Minshull Crown Court after a police operation uncovered their lucrative operation. Imitation designer goods including watches, boots, handbags and clothes were seized by officers investigating the international crime gang which used two corner shops as a front for its giant counterfeiting racket. All were imported from China to Manchester before fake designer labels, buckles or buttons were sewn onto them and they were sold on at well below market price, either via two Manchester corner shops or through the internet. Doing it this . way avoided suspicion when the goods were checked by the Borders Agency . when they arrived in the UK. Fake . Gucci handbags and watches, GHD hair straighteners, UGG boots, . Breitling and Tag Heuer watches, Tiffany and Cartier jewellery, Jimmy Choo . handbags, and D&G clothing were among the counterfeit goods sold by the . organisation. The scale of the gang's business was . such that the goods police confiscated could have fetched £500,000. Jailed: Mahmood Shah, 44 . Jailed: Agha Khan, 27 . Jailed: Sarwari Dlague, 33 . The operation was discovered in November 2011 when surveillance officers acting on a tip-off saw one of the gang pick up a delivery of fake hair straighteners and unload them at The Late Shop, a convenience store. Police raided the shop and found a laptop which proved . the gang's dealings with Chinese companies which provided the goods. The computer also showed that they had set up legitimate arrangements . with unsuspecting courier companies such as DHL and UPS to arrange . deliveries. Up to £30,000 in cash was found, along with more than 350 boxes packed with counterfeit goods. Desirable labels: Manchester police found a vast haul containing counterfeit designer goods . Looks expensive: The gang members added designer touches to goods only after they had been imported . One . of the mob was stopped by police and found to have three mobile phones, a . large amount of cash, UGG metal badges and numerous invoices, as well as business cards for clothing businesses in China. Officers . also recovered a box of buttons, labels and name plates for designer . brands and when they searched a flat above the shop and they also seized . two industrial sized sewing machines. The . following month police raided another Manchester convenience store, The One Shop, . and found piles of . counterfeit branded clothing, footwear, jewellery and watches. Police in Manchester still want to speak to Qand Agha Sarwary, left, and Sherin Agha Sarwary, right . Further . searches uncovered books containing lists of designer brands with . figures next to them, and designer brand brass stamps. Officers also . discovered evidence revealing large amounts of cash were paid to . individuals in China via money transfers. DC Sue Crawford said: 'The cost of counterfeit goods for trademark owners, consumers and the UK economy is huge. The Home Office estimates the criminal gain from counterfeiting in the UK alone is worth £1.3bn every year. 'While it might seem like a victimless crime and that buying a knock-off watch over the Internet is harmless, you are actually putting legitimate businesses at risk and as a consequence, putting people's jobs on the line.' Today Mahmood Shah, 44, of Prestwich was sentenced to two years in prison, Agha Khan, 27, of Manchester was given 12 months, and Sarwari Dlague, 33, also of Manchester, given three years in prison after all were convicted of conspiracy to defraud. Taiba Parsa, 26, of Rochdale and Ayesha Sarwary, 30, of Manchester, were given community service orders after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud. Abdul Jalil, 34, also of Manchester, was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, after he, too, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud. The gang imported goods from China and then selling them via two shops in Manchester and the internet . Two other men - Qand Agha Sarwary and Sherin Agha Sarwary who are the brothers of Sarwari Dlague - are wanted by police. DC Paul Yates said: 'Counterfeiting on this scale requires serious organisation, established distribution channels and money. 'Judging by the swathes of boxes we seized that were stuffed with fake goods, it is clear this gang had set up a highly profitable criminal venture and were pocketing large sums of cash. 'However, their arrogance and mistaken belief they could act with impunity eventually cost them dear. 'We seized so much documentation and evidence that revealed both the scale of this criminal network and the undeniable involvement of those convicted. 'The evidence was so overwhelming that they must have thought they would never be caught. But thanks to our officers their entire network came crashing down around them.'","Gang imported cheap goods to UK then sewed on designer labels later .

These chilling police mugshots were taken nearly a decade apart - but the arrogant scowl of the underworld kingpin they depict has not changed in that time. The first picture, taken in 2003, shows Bradley Walsh aged just 19, soon after he helped beat a pub landlord to death during a botched robbery. And the second dates from just four months ago, after Walsh, now 29, was caught with £160,000 worth of cocaine on him during a taxi ride. The Salford gang boss has just started a seven-year prison sentence - and he is set to be questioned over the unsolved murder of a personal trainer who was shot dead in a bar in 2011. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Bradley Walsh pictured left aged 19 in 2003, and right in 2012 ahead of his return to jail . Walsh is thought to have begun his criminal career after being recruited from an underworld 'job centre' in which unemployed youths volunteer to carry out robberies in return for drug money. Along with three accomplices, he was jailed for eight and a half years in December 2003 for manslaughter and robbery over the death of pub owner Len Tague. The 47-year-old was beaten to death with a fencepost while trying to stop the armed gang from stealing his takings. Walsh served around four years in prison before his release in 2007. He was arrested on suspicion of murder . in September 2011 in relation to the death of gym worker Lee Erdman, 37, . who was shot dead at point-blank range during a late-night lock-in at a . pub in Salford. Victims: Walsh was convicted of killing Len Tague, left, in 2003, and has been questioned over the murder of Lee Erdman, right, in a Salford pub in 2011 . His last night: Mr Erdman at the Wellington pub hours before he was shot dead by a mystery gunman . Up to 30 drinkers witnessed the shooting, but even though a £50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the killer's conviction no one has been charged with the murder. The pub's CCTV hard drive was stolen shortly after the killing and the murder weapon has not been recovered, while gangsters waged a graffiti campaign warning locals against speaking out. Police complained about coming up against a 'wall of silence' during their investigation into the incident. Walsh was not charged in relation to Mr Erdman's death, and was on bail in October last year when the taxi which was carrying him was stopped in Manchester city centre. When police searched the cab, they found a large brick-shaped package wrapped in tape and stashed in a plastic bag. The package contained 990 grams of cocaine, with a purity of 83 per cent and a street value of up to £160,000. Robbery: Walsh was burgling the Park Hotel when he and his accomplices beat Mr Tague to death . Mystery: Patrons of the Wellington have refused to talk to police investigating the death of Mr Erdman . Text messages on Walsh's phone contained multiple references to the sale of drugs, while other messages consisted of threats to customers who were in debt to him. Last week, he pleaded guilty to possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply at Manchester Crown Court. Detective Chief Inspector Chris Downey, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The jailing of Walsh for more than seven years is an absolutely fantastic result. 'What this shows is that absolutely no one is untouchable. Criminals who terrorise communities with their drug dealing - which is often backed up with threats of violence - think they are above the law and cannot be caught. They could not be more wrong. 'I want to use this case to send a message to the people of Salford that we are constantly looking at different ways we can disrupt and dismantle members of organised crime groups who create a cycle of misery with their drug dealing and violent actions. 'What this result shows is that no one - regardless of their status within the criminal fraternity - can escape justice.'","Bradley Walsh jailed for manslaughter aged 19 over killing of pub landlord .

Europol - the European Union's law enforcement agency - said an 18 month investigation uncovered corruption 'on a scale that threatens the very fabric of the game.' It also claimed to have evidence of up to 425 players, officials and criminals thought to have been involved in the corruption. Elite: The Champions League, Europe's top club football competition, has apparently been targeted as part of the match-fixing ring . Investigation: Britain's Rob Wainwright, second from left, announced the probe at a press conference in The Hague today . Suspect: A Champions League matched played in England in the past three or four years is one of the 380 matches investigators say was fixed. The competition's final will be held at Wembley this year . Rob Wainwright, director of Europol, . yesterday refused to identify the allegedly corrupt match played in . England due to 'ongoing judicial proceedings'. But he confirmed it had taken place . in the last three to four years meaning ties involving Manchester . United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspurs and Manchester City could . be involved. World Cup and European qualifiers and . 'several top football matches in European leagues' are among those . under suspicion with a further 300 outside the continent. Mr Wainwright said: 'This is a sad day for European football. 'This is the work of a suspected organised crime syndicate based in Asia and operated with criminal networks around Europe. 'It is clear to us this is the biggest-ever investigation into suspected match-fixing in Europe. 'It has yielded major results which we think have uncovered a big problem for the integrity of football in Europe. 'We have uncovered an extensive criminal network.' Europol believes a crime syndicate . based in Singapore was liaising with criminal networks throughout . Europe, including some Russian speaking gangs. A single fixed match can involve up . to 50 suspects in 10 different countries making it extremely hard to . track down and prosecute those involved. Mr Wainwright added: 'The focus has . been on other countries, not the United Kingdom. However we were . surprised by the scale generally of the criminal enterprise and just how . widespread it was. 'It would be naive and complacent of . those in the UK to think such a criminal conspiracy does not involve the . English game and all the football in Europe.' Corruption: Europol says the match-fixing has taken place in 15 counties and 50 people have been arrested to date . In Germany where £13.8 million was . wagered on matches in the country with payments of £1.73m believed to . have paid to those involved. Financial details were not given for . other countries said to be involved, except that the biggest payment to . an individual was in Austria for a total of £121,000. Friedhelm Althans, a German investigator, said: 'This is the tip of the iceberg'. German police yesterday described a . global network involving couriers ferrying bribes of up to £86,000 per . match around the world to pay off players and referees. In Germany 14 people have already . been jailed in relation to match fixing and convictions have also been . secured in Finland, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria.

A father choked to death on a piece of chewing gum as he made his way home from a night out with friends. Michael Leslie Jones, 59, collapsed outside his home in what a coroner described as 'an awful, tragic accident that could have happened to anyone'. Mr Jones was found lying in the road by his neighbours after an evening with friends at the Dolphin Pub in Mold on July 22. A postmortem examination found a 2cm length of chewing gum obstructing the trachea. Nicola Jones, deputy coroner for Wales North East and North Central, said: 'He had a drink but he wasn't drunk. 'He was steady on his feet and he hadn't complained of feeling unwell.' But Mr Jones, a darts and dominoes player, later collapsed in the middle of the road by his home. Next door neighbours Ellen Mulhearm, . told of how she tried to save her neighbour as he lay in the street. She said: 'My . boyfriend phoned me. He said ""Les is outside on the floor"". I checked for his pulse but there was nothing.' An ambulance was called and neighbours rallied to save him by performing CPR. Paramedics shocked him three times before he arrived at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Alcohol in his blood was said to have been a moderate amount of 154mg per litre. 'So your father probably had less than four pints, not a great deal of alcohol,' Ms Jones told his children at his inquest in Mold on Monday.

The swarm attacked the 23-year-old Brazilian woman after her car left the road in a thunderstorm on Saturday night. Doctors in Rosario do Sul city, Brazil, said the woman may not have known she was allergic to bee stings. Military Police trainee Mariana Lucher died after her car hit a bee hive and she was stung more than 500 times . Police believe she lost control of the car during the storm and her car hit the hive which had been left under a tree by beekeepers. Witnesses saw her running away from the car after the crash in an attempt to escape the bees. Federal Police named the woman as military police trainee Mariana Lucher. She was buried on Sunday. Scene: It is believed Mariana Lucher lost control of her car (pictured) during a thunderstorm before she hit a bee hive in Rosario do Sul city, Brazil . Tragic: The 23-year-old woman died after she was stung in Rosario do Sul in Brazil . Beekeepers know that individual swarms not only have their own group 'personalities' - some are more aggressive than others, for example - but also that they can behave differently depending on the weather. Hot and humid conditions often make bees bad tempered, while mild and sunny weather tends to encourage calm behaviour. Though European bees rarely attack people, the same is not true elsewhere. A hybrid strain of bee known for its aggressiveness have been spreading north from Mexico since the Seventies . In the U.S., 'Africanised' honey bees, a hybrid strain known for its aggressiveness, have been spreading north from Mexico since the Seventies. The Africanised bee was the result of experimental breeding carried out in Brazil in the Fifties. It was designed to produce a strain that was better adapted to the Tropics than common European strains, such as the Italian honey bee, Apis mellifera ligustica. Unfortunately, combining the genes of Tanzanian and European insects produced a bee that, while productive, could be extremely defensive and even aggressive. Honey bees are considered to be potentially dangerous across much of the Tropics. The main reason bee attacks can be so serious is the way the stings encourage further assaults. When a honey bee stings, it drenches the site with chemicals called pheromones, which send a message to the other bees, encouraging them to sting the same spot. The stings will be concentrated in sensitive areas such as the nose and eyes. When a honey bee stings you, the barbed protuberance through which the poison is delivered rips away the last segment of the animal's abdomen. This means that the bee dies of severe haemorrhaging within minutes.","Woman named as military police trainee Mariana Lucher .

Manny, who did not live with either parent, explained to the Sun Sentinel that he had invited his father to watch the Super Bowl with him when they spoke on Friday. 'There was no indication there was anything wrong,' he said. 'He said OK. I had no idea that's the last time I would see him.'

Joy: The 28-year-old celebrates his triumph at a polo match to raise money for his charity, Sentebale . He said he wanted to get more involved in charity work and royal duties on his return from Afghanistan. Now Prince Harry has announced he is to travel to Africa at the end of the month to support the work being undertaken with children suffering from HIV and Aids by his charity, Sentebale. St James's Palace revealed this morning that the 28-year-old royal will visit Lesotho, a tiny land-locked kingdom in the centre of South Africa, from February 25 to 27. He will then fly on to Johannesburg for a gala dinner raising funds to build the first permanent centre for children and young people suffering from the disease. The prince will spend the first two days of his visit to Lesotho privately, travelling the kingdom with close friend and charity co-founder, Prince Seeiso, to learn more about his charity’s initiatives in the region. The pair first met when the prince undertook a gap year trip to the region and in 2006 set up Sentebale, which in Sesotho, the language of Lesotho, means ‘forget me not’. The name was deliberately chosen in memory of both of the princes’ late mothers. Harry, in particular, believed that in setting up a project in one of the most poverty-stricken and marginalised areas of the world, he would be continuing Diana, Princess of Wales’s legacy. Following the private part of the trip, the prince will undertake several public engagements on February 27 in Maseru, the capital city. Among the projects he will visit are the Kananelo Centre for the Deaf and the Reitumetse Church Project,  which care for children with disabilities and orphans. Harry will then fly onto Johannesburg for The Sentebale Gala Dinner, marking the launch of a major capital fundraising programme to build Lesotho’s first permanent centre for children and young people infected with, or affected by, HIV and Aids. The centre, which will be named after Prince Seeiso’s late mother, Queen Mamohato Bereng Seeiso, will be built on a sacred plot known as Thabu-Bosiu, ‘the birthplace of the nation’. Just like their mother: Harry and brother William on a 2010 visit to the African charities they support. Harry's organisation Sentebale means 'forget me not' in memory of Diana . Just 11,500 square miles in size and with a population of just over two million, of which around 40 per cent live under the international poverty line, Lesotho is severely afflicted by HVI/Aids. According to 2009 figures, more than 23 per cent of people aged over 15 in the country are infected, one of the highest rates in the world. In urban areas around 50 per cent of women under 40 have HIV. Life expectancy in the country is just 42 years for both men and women, which has in turn had a catastrophic effect on the country’s children. Harry is currently on leave after spending four months on the frontline in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter co-pilot gunner. In an interview to mark his arrival back home last month, the third in line to the throne made clear that his military commitment came first but insisted that he did want to schedule in more charitable work and official engagements over the coming months.","He had promised to focus on charitable work upon return from Afghanistan .

He is accused of kissing and groping them after being booked for a massage . A masseur accused of sexually assaulting two of his female clients boasted to one of them that he was good at performing sex acts and tried to kiss her, a court has heard. Gary Lester, 53, of Kensworth, Bedfordshire, told the woman as he massaged her that he was aroused and said she had a great body, St Albans Crown Court heard. The 27-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly returned to her parents' home in a distressed state and went for a shower, waking her mother, who said her daughter was ‘scrubbing her body hysterically’. The mother added: ‘There were red marks all over her - her chest, her face, her neck. I was shocked and asked what the matter was. She was rubbing her skin and couldn't speak properly.’ The mother said she covered her with a towel and gave her hug, taking a few minutes to calm her down. She said: ‘My daughter said Gary had been very sexual toward her - verbally and physically. He was stroking her thighs whilst being very suggestive. He also talked about how she had a great body.’ She added: ‘He tried to kiss her and it was on her chin. He said he was “hot and flustered”. Two days later she reported it to the police. The woman, of Bedfordshire, now aged 29, had first gone for an appointment with Lester in March 2011. After that, she told her mother Lester . was ‘a bit strange’ and was unsure if she would make another . appointment - but she went back in June 2011, when the assault is . alleged to have taken place. Hearing: Mr Lester, whose trial is taking place at St Albans Crown Court (pictured), has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting one woman in June 2011 and to sexually assaulting another woman in September 2010 . Mr Lester has pleaded not guilty to . sexually assaulting the woman in June 2011 and to sexually assaulting . another woman from Hertfordshire in September 2010. Last week the first woman - from . Hertfordshire - said she had a 'Raynor' deep tissue massage from Lester . at her home in Kings Langley in December 2009 after he was recommended. She said: ‘I was stressed out. I thought a massage would be good to help me relax. I had problems with my neck.’ He took her blood pressure and carried out a consultation.‘It was a full body massage,' she added. 'Everywhere apart from my private area. It was OK.’ The woman said on that occasion she . had no complaint and sent Lester a message saying: ‘Thanks for a great . massage. I had a lovely sleep last night. I will have a massage . regularly with you.’ But it was not until September 2010 that she booked a second massage at her new St Albans home. The woman, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said her daughter, who is in her 20s, was in the house when the massage began. She went on: ‘I was covered with a towel. He was massaging up my leg. I started to feel uneasy. ‘The pressure was different - it was lighter, less like a . massage, something more sensual. He said: “You have got lovely skin”. I . thought it was a bit odd.’ She said he told her that he was not . having much of a sex life with his girlfriend and did not know if they . would stay together. ‘I didn't want to know anything about his sex life, while he is massaging me and I am lying there,’ she said. 'The pressure was different - it was lighter, less like a massage, something more sensual. He said: ""You have got lovely skin"". I thought it was a bit odd' Woman from Hertfordshire . On that occasion the woman said he massaged her breasts, but did so in a way that she did not think was sexual. George Heimler, prosecuting, asked her if she wanted Lester to do anything in a sexual way. She replied: ‘No.’ He went on: ‘Were you interested in anything beyond his professional services?’ She replied: ‘No.’ The woman said she was a little . confused, but booked a third massage at her St Albans home later that . month. She lit candles, put out aroma therapy oil and dimmed the lights. She said: ‘He massaged me and said he . was going to massage at a swingers' party the following weekend. He was . working on my legs and came up to do my bottom. ‘He was a bit longer than I expected. He said: “I'm taking too long massaging your bum. You have got a really nice bum”.’ The woman, who said she had more than . 100 massages from others in the past, told the jury of eight men and . four women that she felt uncomfortable. Then, she said he ran his hands up from her hip up the side of her body and said: 'Do you want a sensual massage?' She said she did not want one, but . allowed him to massage her breasts, which she thought was part of a . normal massage. She said she told him she did not feel comfortable and . he stopped. 'My daughter said Gary had been very sexual toward her - verbally and physically. He was stroking her thighs whilst being very suggestive. He also talked about how she had a great body' Mother of Bedfordshire woman, 27 . At the end of the massage she said he . kissed her on the forehead. ‘I said: “Did you just kiss me?” He didn't . say anything and he just kissed me again in the same place,’ she said. The Hertfordshire woman made a . complaint to the police in June 2011 after hearing that a woman from . Bedfordshire, who is not known to her, had made a similar allegation. Mr Heimler said: ‘He is a professional . masseur. He took advantage of his position to test the boundaries with . the two complainants to see if they want to provide sexual favours, to . see if he could obtain some form of sexual gratification. ‘He kissed the first victim twice. It was unsought, undesired and unwanted.’ When Lester was questioned by the police he said all the contact was fully consensual and he behaved professionally throughout. He said the Bedfordshire woman had . been ‘flirting like crazy’ and was coming onto him sexually. He said the . Hertfordshire woman was the one who spoke about sex and swingers . parties.

Theft: Sharon Walker, 46, stole nearly £5,000 from patients while working as an administrator in a care home . A care home worker has been jailed for 16 months after she stole almost £5,000 from terminally-ill patients' funeral funds. Sharon Walker, 46, then used the cash she stole from a cerebral palsy sufferer and a man dying of multiple sclerosis to buy a camcorder and an iPod for her husband. The grandmother stole a total of £4,992.99 from the two patients being cared for at Acres Nook Nursing Home in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, where she worked as an administrator. The victims had set aside the money to pay for their funeral costs and was intended to be passed onto their relatives when they died. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Walker stole £2,500 from a funeral plan account she set up for a 33-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer, and a further £2,310 from a 61-year-old suffering from multiple scleroisis. Walker's crimes came to light when the patients died and their relatives tried to access the funeral plan money and discovered the accounts were both empty. She pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud and was jailed for 16 months on Friday. Sentencing Walker, Judge Paul Glenn blasted her for preying on 'vulnerable' victims. He told her: 'The courts have a duty to protect those who can't help themselves. 'The residents were elderly patients and young adults with physical difficulties. They had to rely on staff for their care. You took advantage of a lax system. 'The particular vulnerability of your victims is a significant aggravating feature.' The court heard Walker, from Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, rose from her position as a housekeeper in 2006 to become chief administrator of the home in July 2009. Position of trust: Walker rose from her position as housekeeper at . Acres Nook Care Home in Boathorse Lane, Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, to become the chief administrator . She exploited a loophole in the system designed to safeguard residents' cash and siphoned off funds for herself. Prosecutor Howard Searle said: 'The system was subject of potential abuse and she abused the system.' Judge Glenn ordered Walker to repay £4,992.99 by July 29 - or face a further three months in jail. Brian McKenna, defending, admitted the offences were 'mean' but said his client was under 'intolerable' pressure at work as she had no experience of bookkeeping or accounting. The 69-bed care home - which is now run by HC-One - was operated by scandal-hit Southern Cross at the time of the incident. A spokesman said: 'We can reassure residents, their families and our community that the home has been under a new operator for a year now, and we would never tolerate this behaviour.'

One of the best preserved Second World War airfields in the country has been put up for sale. Perranporth, home of 24 RAF squadrons between 1941 and 1944, has been put on the market by former mobile phone magnate John George, with an asking price of £1.5million. The 330-acre site in West Cornwall still features an original control tower, underground bunker, fighter shelters, pill boxes and the armaments depot which Mr George converted into the HQ of Jag Communications - once Britain's third largest independent mobile phones retailer. For sale: Perranporth, a World War II Spitfire base, has gone on the market for £1.5 million . Formed in 1989 in Cornwall, JAG Communications encompassed over 160 outlets in Cornwall, the South of England and Wales. At its height, over 600 people were employed across the UK. As a result of the credit crunch, Jag was taken over by Go Mobile and Mr George quit the phones business. He has since set up an air taxi service in the Channel Islands. An experienced pilot, Mr George bought the airfield four years ago to ease the commute from Guernsey where he is a tax exile. He said: 'I bought Perranporth airfield because it was convenient'. 'I could land my plane and walk 100 yards from the end of the runway to be at my desk. At work: RAF crew gather around a Spitfire at Perranporth Airfield during the Second World War . Passion: Former phones magnate John George bought the base four years ago so that he could commute easily from Guernsey where he is a tax exile . 'When our shops went in 2010 we had to run down the head office and clearly I no longer needed an airfield. 'But I still love it. I've never thought of it as somewhere you own - more a place you look after until you pass it on. 'It just has an incredible atmosphere. You look out on a summer evening and think of all those crews who served here and you can't help but be affected by that.' Perranporth was opened in April 1941 with a single runway and a large tent to serve as a barracks for the airmen. Officers were billeted in a local hotel. The RAF planned at first to operate a single squadron of Spitfires to protect shipping and coastal towns from Luftwaffe raids. Perranporth is thought to be one of the best preserved wartime airfields in the country . Convenient: Mr George quit the phones business and set up an air taxi service in the Channel Islands . The airfield is still fully operational and has remained popular with both businessmen and holidaymakers visiting Cornwall . But as the war moved on its role changed, and by 1942 two squadrons were based there, carrying out raids on northern France and escorting bombers in attacks on French ports. The last Spitfires left in 1944 to be replaced by squadrons of Avengers and Swordfish tasked with hunting U and E Boats in the Atlantic. Perranporth was never targeted by the Germans and according to English Heritage its 'defence landscape survives virtually as it was during World War II'. The airfield is still fully operational and, despite competition from nearby Newquay Airport, has remained popular with both businessmen and holidaymakers visiting Cornwall. Humble beginnings: Perranporth was opened in April 1941 with just a single runway and large tent to serve as a barracks for the airmen .

Mr George, 51, says his estate agent, Savills, has already received more than 100 inquiries from potential buyers. He said: 'It really is a fine example of our military heritage .

Police negotiators are still trying to bargain with an Alabama gunman, more than 24 hours after he abducted a six-year-old boy from his school bus and held him hostage in his underground bunker. The suspect, Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, who also allegedly shot dead the driver of the bus when he tried to protect the children, is described as a 'paranoid survivalist' with 'anti-American views'. He is fiercely protective of his property in rural Midland City, Alabama. Neighbors said he beat one of their dogs to death with a pipe after it ran onto his land and pulled a gun on the the man who lives next door and his daughter after a dispute over a speed bump. Authorities say the boy - whose mother calls him 'Love Bug' - is autistic. Dykes has allowed police to pass his medication through a PVC pipe that supplies air to the underground bunker. Scroll down for video . Out in force: Dozens of local police officers, Alabama State Police troopers and federal agents from the ATF and FBI swarmed the area where the boy was being held captive . Gearing up: A bomb squad unit is also on hand to deal with any possible explosive devices in the bunker . Panic: A suspect, identified as Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, allegedly held up a school bus Tuesday in Midland City, Alabama, shooting dead the bus driver and taking a boy hostage . The little boy is apparently unhurt and is watching television in the cramped hovel. The driver is identified as Charles Poland Jr, 66, who has been driving a bus for Dale County Schools since 2009. He is being hailed a hero for trying to stop Dykes from taking the young boy. Witnesses say Dykes did not know the child and may have been trying to take a hostage to use as leverage in his legal problems. The Dothan Eagle reports that Dykes was supposed to appear in court on Wednesday for a bench trial over a menacing charge. Dykes’ neighbor, James Edward Davis Jr . told the paper that the man pointed a gun at him and his daughter in . December, saying that they had driven into his yard. Another neighbor, Claudia Davis said he yelled and fired shots at her, her son and her . baby grandson over damage Dykes claimed their pickup truck did to a . makeshift speed bump in the dirt road. No one was hurt. Heavily armed: These members of the State Police special operations team are geared up with body armor and assault weapons . A girl who was on the school bus when Dykes allegedly stormed it said he referred to his upcoming court case. 'He started talking about how he needed a kid because something about the law coming after him,' she told ABC News. Dykes' neighbors described him a violent, paranoid man. Ronda Wilbur, who lived across the road from Dykes, said he beat her 120-pound dog with a lead pipe for coming onto his side of the dirt road. The dog died a week later. 'He said his only regret was he didn't beat him to death all the way,' Wilbur said. She called animal control, who came out and talked to Dykes, but nothing else happened. 'If a man can kill a dog, and beat it with a lead pipe and brag about it, it's nothing until it's going to be people.' Authorities are reportedly speaking with Dykes through a PVC pipe that runs into the bunker. Neighbors say the bunker is about four feet wide, six feet long and eight feet deep and it's covered by several feet of sand. It was intended to be a bomb shelter. Dykes, a Vietnam veteran, built it by hand. Rural: The standoff is taking place outside Midland City, Alabama, which is a rural town in the deep southeast of the state, near the Florida border . Cordoned off: Police set up check points and closed off roads all around the scene of the crime and the site where the boy was being held hostage . 'It’s the craziest thing. He will be outside in his yard digging dirt at 2.30 in the morning,' Mr Davis told the Eagle. Dykes habor 'anti-American' and 'anti-government' views, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. He cut down all of the trees on his property, so he could see anyone who approached his house. He also ringed the boarder of his land in barbed wire. Added Mr Creel: 'He’s the type that thinks the government’s out to get him. He’s not right in the head.' Neighbors say Dykes boarded the bus and demanded two children to take hostage. The driver, who has worked at Dale County schools since 2009, refused to give up the children and resisted, according to NBC News. Dykes then shot and killed Poland. The six-year-old boy taken hostage had reportedly fainted on the bus - which is how Dykes was able to carry him away. 'I talked to a girl that was riding the bus, and she told me that he came on the bus and said, ""I need two kids between the ages of 6 and 8,""' Michael Creel, Dykes' neighbor, told the Eagle. 'The driver told him, ""I can’t do that."" (The driver) tried to get away from the guy.' Children on the bus said that the man who boarded the bus told most of the students to get off. They then said that the man shot the bus driver several times. Authorities . say the shooter took the child to an area behind nearby Destiny Church. WSFA reported that bomb squads were called to the scene, though there . was no sign of explosive devices. Witness: This student said the gunman ranted about needing a 'child' to 'get the law off his back' - likely a reference to his court appearance that was scheduled for today . Safe: Parents hugged their children tightly after the ordeal on the bus. Witnesses say the gunman was looking for a hostage because of his legal trouble . Residents in the immediate area were also evacuated as a precaution. Midland City police would not comment, and a call to the Dale City Sheriff's office was not answered Tuesday.

They were among the most feared killing machines of World War One, causing the deaths of thousands of servicemen at sea. So when the people of Hastings woke one morning to see this German U-boat on their beach, it caused something of a shock. These eerie pictures show how the horrors of war got a little bit too close to home for the people of the Sussex town. Frightening: In 1919, this German U-boat caused something of a commotion among the people of Hastings after it beached in the Sussex town . Washed-up: The U-boat, number 118, had been surrendered on February 23 1919 - exactly one year after it was launched . Damage: The type two boat was due to be transferred to France but the tow parted and she went aground off Hastings on April 15 . The U-boat, number 118, was surrendered on February 23, 1919 - exactly one year after it was launched. The type two boat was due to be transferred to France . but the tow parted and she went aground off the Sussex coast two months later - this was despite the attempts of a French destroyer to break her up with gunfire. Thousands of people flocked to the . seafront near the Queens Hotel to catch a glimpse of the killing machine. Eventually, it became so popular that the town clerk started charging people a small fee to be allowed on . board. Interest: Thousands of people flocked to the seafront to catch a glimpse of the boat . Killing machine: The type two boat was built in the Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg and was launched on February 23 1918 . Captured: Under the command of Herbert Strohwasser, U-118 managed to sink two ships while on its one and only patrol before being surrendered on February 23 1919 . The U-boat campaign of World War One took place largely in the seas surrounding the British Isles and Mediterranean. U-boats were used mainly by German commanders to block the trade routes of the British forces. The German Empire needed imports for domestic food production while the UK relied on imports to feed the population. Both also need materiel to supply their war industry, sparking huge battles to block each others trade routes. The Germans used the U-boat as a way of fighting back against the Royal Navy, which was far superior in size and could operate almost anywhere, unlike the German Navy surface fleet. During World War One, U-boats were responsible for sinking about 5,000 ships and killing about 5,000 men in combat. The proceeds went towards the Mayor's Fund for the welcome home of the troops which was planned later that year. But residents soon grew sick of children pelting the boat with rocks . and making a racket throughout the night and the order was  eventually given to break . her up. Parts of U-118 were then snatched and dispersed all over Hastings. The town itself was presented with the submarine's gun but it was buried in the shingle by wave action.

Plans to give hundreds of millions of pounds in subsidies to European tobacco farmers have been criticised by anti-smoking campaigners. The tobacco growers could get the extra cash as soon as next year after members of the European Parliament voted to make changes which would allow member states to decide which crops receive European Union farming subsidies. The old system was phased out in 2010 at a time when tobacco farmers in 12 EU countries including Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Italy were receiving around £260million in subsidies. Back to the old system: Millions of pounds in subsidies could be given to European tobacco farmers . But after it was scrapped, tobacco farming across the EU declined. It is now feared the proposals could result in huge sums going back to tobacco growers. Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Subsidising Greek and Bulgarian tobacco growers is clearly wrong. Environment secretary Owen Paterson has criticised the plans . 'Not only would it take us back to the dark days of skewing the basic laws of supply and demand, it would also spend British taxpayers' money on a product that is of absolutely no benefit to our society.' Anti-smoking campaigners have said the plans are 'wasteful' especially as the European Commission is currently running a campaign to encourage smokers to give up cigarettes at a cost of £27million. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, described the move as a step backwards and that the plans made no sense at all. She also urged MEPs and the Commission to reject the proposals when they are ratified further. A spokesman for the European Commission said the committee's proposal was unlikely to happen. Tobacco growers have been looking at other ways of using tobacco other than cigarettes and in Bulgaria a perfume has been manufactured called Tobacco and Roses. The perfume comes in a box with a photograph of three cigars entwined with roses. Tobacco is responsible for more than 650,000 deaths in the EU every year.","Tobacco farmers in 12 EU countries were receiving around £260million in subsidies before the old system was phased out in 2010 .

"By . Oliver Wadeson . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 2 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 2 February 2013 . For almost 150 years, blue plaques have celebrated famous former residents, becoming in that time a much-loved feature of the British townscape. So the announcement by English Heritage, which runs the scheme in London, that it is suspending installation of the signs because of Government funding cuts has been greeted with mournful sighs by conservation groups. Yet for those who own a property already adorned with a plaque, it might be good news. Blue plaques add prestige and historical interest, and those already erected are likely to be cherished to an even greater extent, and may help to increase a property’s value. Mark of distinction: The five-bedroom home in London's Brook Green has an asking price of £4.5 million, in part thanks to the blue enamelled plaque . Sui Chin McKeand is one of a handful of people with a blue-plaque property on the market. Her house in Brook Green, West London, which has an asking price of £4.5 million, was once occupied by the illustrator and engraver Sir Frank Short, who died in 1945 aged 87. A plaque in his honour was erected in the Forties by London County Council and has since been approved by English Heritage. Retired lawyer Sui Chin, 59, who is from Singapore but moved to England in 1985, bought the house with her late husband James McKeand in 1991 for £625,000. James, a solicitor, died ten years ago, and with her daughter Claire, 28, spending most of her time elsewhere, Sui Chin is now looking for a smaller property. Inspired: The sitting room inside the property in Brook Green . Rising up: The plaque adds to the value of the Grade II listed five-bedroom property built in 1820 . She confesses that in 1991 the blue . plaque was hardly a consideration when she decided to buy, and she had . no knowledge of Sir Frank, who was president of the Royal Society of . Painter-Etchers. ‘I wanted a property with off-street parking and my husband liked the garden,’ she says. Since then, however, she has embraced the prestige the plaque has bestowed on her home and ‘formed  a relationship’ with her house’s previous occupant. Blue Plaque: The plaque on Sui Chin McKeand's London home . ‘Out of curiosity, I did some research . on Sir Frank and learned about his career. It was through this research . that I managed to find some of his works at a gallery,’ she says, . pointing out three prints that hang on a wall in the ground-floor dining . room. The prints are now . part of the fabric of the house and Sui Chin says she will consider . offers for them from buyers of the house if they want to retain its link . to Short. Sui Chin was . also obliged to form a relationship with English Heritage over her plans . to renovate the five-storey Grade II listed house, which was built in . 1820. When she bought it, part of the property was in commercial use – a South African company used two floors as an office. Sui Chin wanted to restore it to a single dwelling but English Heritage laid down a number of restrictions regarding what she could do. She spent £260,000 on the renovations, benefiting from the VAT exemption on work restoring older homes. This exemption was scrapped last October, except in cases where derelict properties are being salvaged. ‘English Heritage was very particular about some things. It was almost as if they wanted you to live like someone in the Victorian era,’ she says. ‘For example, the house had 11 fireplaces and I was allowed to remove only one, and I wasn’t allowed to cut through any joists.’ Making his mark: Frank Short, painter and engraver, who lived in the West London property after which the blue plaque was erected in his honour . Now, with five bedrooms, three receptions, three bathrooms, a dining room and a conservatory, the house makes a fine family home. Sui Chin also points out that the basement floor, which has its own entrance, kitchen and bathroom, could be used  as a separate dwelling. Jonathan Haward, of County Homesearch, a company that finds homes for prospective buyers, believes the blue plaque will add value in light of the decision to suspend the scheme. ‘It adds terrifically to the history of a house,’ he says, ‘which helps it to sell and it could help attract multiple buyers, so driving up the price. ‘With English Heritage deciding not to consider new applications for now, this will especially apply to those selling homes with existing plaques.’ James Rideout, of selling agents Hamptons International, says: ‘This house is a local landmark and has generated a host of enquiries, particularly from international buyers fascinated by British history.’ Hamptons International; 020 7717 5305, hamptons. co.uk, www.english-heritage.org.uk .","Blue plaque, five-bedroom, West London property on the market for £4.5m .

It is where the rich, powerful and influential choose to live away from the spotlight. But the well-heeled neighbourhood in North London, where the imposing detached houses start at £5million, is now the setting for an up-market spat over a newcomer’s plans to build an underground swimming pool. A group of residents in Hampstead Garden Suburb, including Lord Justice Leveson, TV presenter Richard Madeley and former banking boss Sir Victor Blank, are worried that the development may damage their nearby homes. Project: How the underground pool complex, which has caused the spat between neigbours, may look . Worried: Concerns have been raised about the plans to build the underground pool complex by about a dozen residents, including Lord Justice Leveson (left) and Richard Madeley (right) Former Lloyds chairman Sir Victor –  heavily criticised in the credit crunch for pushing through the disastrous takeover of ailing Halifax Bank of Scotland in 2008 – has now instructed lawyers to try to obtain a High Court injunction to ban work on the six-bed mansion until comprehensive surveys are carried out on the impact of the basement excavation. City derivatives trader Scott Franklin bought his home for £4.87million last year and lodged a planning application with Barnet Council. It involves creating a basement under the existing patio and lawn to house a pool and changing room measuring almost 15 metres, and a games room and wine cellar stretching a similar distance. But neighbours want tests to check the potential impact of Mr Franklin’s plans on underground water levels and what effect this may have on their properties. They say a similar basement excavation in the area has left one home close to collapse. Sir Victor, 70, is bringing the legal action after concerns raised by around a dozen neighbours, including the judge who led the Leveson inquiry into media standards and former This Morning presenter Mr Madeley. Injunction: Former Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank is bringing the legal action as neighbours want tests to check the impact of the plans . At her home close to Mr Franklin’s yesterday, Lady Blank said: ‘They need to get a geological survey done. ‘All we want is for them to make sure that we’re not in danger. We have the River Fleet going through here. ‘All we’ve asked for them to do is make sure that they have the right tests done – the geological tests – around their property because what they’re trying to do is put a large basement on a small garden and this is on a hill.’ Asked why the dispute was going to the High Court, Lady Blank said: ‘To get the right information so, if permission is given, our houses are not affected either by water being diverted into our back gardens or that it will be dried up because this is clay soil. ‘We’re not nasty people, you know if somebody wants to build something it’s fine...you need to do research and if there is a problem we have to know how to deal with it.’ Asked why the dispute was going to the High Court, Lady Blank said: ‘I’ll leave that to your imagination.’ Asked how long the dispute had been going on, Lady Blank said: ‘Since they moved in.’ A spokesman for Lord Justice Leveson said: ‘The judge is not a party to or connected to the legal action. He has no comment to make on the legal action or the circumstances.’ Sir Victor’s lawyers go to court later this month to try to get an injunction to stop the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust from approving the scheme until further notice. The Trust, set up in 1968 to preserve the character of the area, rules on every development in the conservation area alongside Barnet Council. It has signed an agreement pledging to make no decision before the High Court hearing. Trust chairman Angus Walker said: ‘There are legal proceedings which will be heard in February and the trust has no comment in anticipation of those proceedings.’ Mr Franklin, 39, who lives with his wife Melissa, declined to comment yesterday but said he was happy for the court to make a judgment. Barnet Council said it had received two planning applications for the site. A spokesman said one was being considered and the other was being appealed. It was founded at the start of the 20th century as a ‘model community for people of all classes living together in beautiful houses’. The beauty of Hampstead Garden Suburb undoubtedly remains but – with its houses now costing anywhere between £5million and £50million – it has become the preserve of the powerful and the famous. The area’s appeal owes much to Henrietta Barnett, the vicar’s wife who wanted to build better housing for the poor. She set up a trust which initially bought land owned by Eton College. Her aim was that ‘the houses will not be put in uniform lines nor in close relationship’ and not be built without ‘consideration for picturesque appearance’. Areas of woodland, hedgerows and mature trees were to be retained and work began in 1907, with the development soon spreading on to more land. Cottages were built for rent at low rates, but after the Great War rising costs ended the ability of the private sector to offer such housing. From then on the trust ensured coherence in design but the houses went to more affluent buyers. Residents now include King Constantine of Greece, Prince William’s godfather, Lord Winston the surgeon and scientist, and TV host Jonathan Ross.","Residents in Hampstead Garden Suburb seek High Court injunction .

Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been accused of betraying dozens of children hoping for a new life in the West after signing a new law blocking all adoptions by American families. From January 1 it will be illegal to take a baby from Russia to the US under the law signed by president Putin today. The move will have an immediate effect on as many as 52 children in Russia who were preparing for adoption - many of whom suffer disabilities or live in bleak orphanages according to charities. The Fillmore family from Utah adopted Hazel, a . four-year-old Russian girl with Down's syndrome on Christmas Eve, making them among the last American parents to be permitted to do so. Lucky: Heather and Jeremy Fillmore, left and right, welcomed little Hazel, centre, into their home on Christmas Eve just before the new ban on the adoption of Russian children by US families came in to force . The Fillmore's welcomed . little Hazel into their home after fighting for almost a . year to adopt her. They are among dozens of American families calling on President Putin to reconsider for the health of the children involved. The Kremlin human rights council said a total of 52 children were on the brink of being adopted and had been told they are getting a new home in America. 'We now have three children in the process of adoption, two of them are handicapped - one with Down's Syndrome aged five and one with HIV aged four,' said an official at just one agency. 'These children are no longer so small, they understand that future parents are coming for them, they are waiting for them and the families have already visited them. Siblings: Hazel, 4, pictured right with one of her new siblings, is settling in well to her new home in American Fork, Utah. Critics say many other Russian children have been denied a similar future due to Mr Putin's decision . Bittersweet: While being thrilled to have Hazel, pictured right, the Fillmore's are heartbroken that Russia has finalized a ban on Americans adopting Russian children . 'For us this decision is painful. We are working with live people. It is a shock.' 'The adoptive parents are not guilty . of anything and the orphans themselves have of course done nothing . wrong,' said Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Kremlin human rights council. President Putin's move is seen as revenge for a new American law banning visas for Russian . officials implicated in the 2009 prison death of the whistle-blowing . lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Several Russian politicians - including respected foreign minister Sergei Lavrov - spoke out against the new crackdown which was rushed through parliament in a matter of days to slap down the Americans. Ban: Russian President Vladimir Putin, pictured, has signed a bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children that has raised tensions between Moscow and Washington . President Putin ignored protests, accusing the US of 'acting brazenly and arrogantly' towards Russia. He said the 'outflow' of children for foreign adoption posed a threat to Russia's future. 'We may reach a certain point at . which - once we overstep it - we will not be able to stop our ruin,' he . warned. So we have to be extremely sensitive and attentive toward such . things.' US families adopted nearly 1,000 . Russian children last year but, from January 1, such moves will be . illegal. The ban maybe extended soon to all foreign countries, including . Britain. The . US is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than . 60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two . decades. The . US State Department says it regrets the Russian Parliament's decision . to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up . in families. Amnesty International Europe and . Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a . childish response to the Magnitsky Act. 'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.' Kremlin children's tsar Pavel Astakhov said that Russian families would now adopt the children. However, they earlier declined to do . so - which is why the youngsters are available for foreign adoption. Commentator Yuliya Latynina dubbed the move 'worse than a crime.' 'The man responsible for this mistake is none other than President Vladimir Putin,' she said. 'According to various estimates, 50 . to 95 percent of children who grow up in Russian orphanages become drug . addicts or alcoholics or commit suicide. Deep concerns: The U.S. State Department said it had 'deep concerns' about the welfare of more than 700,000 Russian children in orphanages, particularly those with disabilities like Hazel, pictured . Big brother: Hazel, 4, spent Christmas day getting to know her new family in Utah . 'Russian orphanages essentially . produce children who suffer from Mowgli Syndrome - that is, they are . ill-equipped to function in any capacity in society.' Among those condemning the new law . was Paralympic record breaking medal winner Jessica Long, 20, who was . adopted by US parents from Siberia. 'I love my family here in America, . thanks to them I am what I am and I achieved what I achieved. I learned . to swim and now I've got bright future ahead of me,' she said. 'To . prohibit adoption means to deprive these children of their bright . future. It is so sad. 'They have done nothing bad, these . children. They are just children. So why prohibit adoption if it would . have given them a hope to have things they never had?' A Moscow court today also acquitted . the former deputy chief of a Moscow prison where Magnitsky was held over . causing his death by negligence. Success: Jessica Long, pictured, was given up shortly after birth by her parents in Siberia but was raised by adoptive parents in the United States and became a Paralympic swimming champion . Winner: Long, pictured, won a gold medal for the women's 100m freestyle S8 swimming final at the London 2012 Paralympic Games . Dmitry Kratov was the only Russian . official to still be facing charges over the Magnitsky case. Mr . Magnitsky exposed an alleged £125 million corruption racket among senior . Russian officials and paid with his life, say his supporters. The legislation was dubbed by the . pro-Kremlin press as the Dima Yakovlev law, referring to a Russian boy . adopted in the United States who died after being locked in a hot car by . his adoptive US father in 2008. Preempting criticism of the move, Putin promised measures to better care for his country's orphans. 'I . intend to sign also a presidential decree that will modify the support . mechanisms for orphaned children ... especially those who are in a . difficult situation, by that I mean in poor health,' he said. It took about 11 months for the Fillmores to bring Hazel home from Russia. She arrived at Salt Lake City International Airport at 11pm on Christmas Eve. 'It's been tough, but worth it, and to have her here and be part of our family, it's now great,' Jeremy Fillmore told the Deseret News. 'We feel like we're complete and we're excited to have her.' They . found Hazel through a website that advocates for children with special . needs called Reece’s Rainbow Down Syndrome Adoption Ministry. According . to the newspaper, she was the second girl they adopted from Russia with . the help of the website. Anya, who is now 7 years old, was adopted in . March 2011. The banning of American adoptions plays on sensitivity in Russia about adoptions by foreigners, which skyrocketed as the social safety net unraveled with the 1991 Soviet collapse.

He exposed his blue boxer shorts when his loose trousers slipped to his knees during clashes near Cairo's Tahrir Square. It came on the fourth day of violence that has  swept the country and left more than 50 dead. Thousands of people have protested against the rule of President Mohammed Morsi and a court verdict to execute 21 people that were involved in a riot last year that left 74 football fans dead. In a bid to restore calm, Mr Morsi has declared a month-long state of emergency in the three cities of Ismailiya , Suez and Port Said - which has seen the worst of the violence. But defying the 9pm to 6am curfew, thousands of protesters demonstrated in the affected cities last night. The army has been deployed in two of the cities and cabinet approved a measure to let soldiers arrest civilians. A cabinet source told Reuters any trials . would be before civilian courts, but the step is likely to anger . protesters who accuse Mursi of using high-handed security tactics of the kind they fought against to oust President Hosni Mubarak. Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch in . Cairo said the police would once again have the right to . arrest people 'purely because they look suspicious', in a throw back to the regime of former president Hosni Mubarak. 'It is a classic knee-jerk reaction to think the emergency law will help . bring security,' she said. 'It gives so much discretion to the Ministry . of Interior that it ends up causing more abuse, which in turn causes . more anger.' Demonstrations are continuing for a fifth consecutive day today as police fire volleys of teargas at dozens of youths throwing stones in Cairo. Egyptian mourners carry the coffins of six people killed in clashes on Sunday in Port Said . Women angry at the recent violence shout during the funerals of six people who were killed in Port Said. A total of 44 people have died in the city since Saturday . A 46-year-old bystander was killed by a gun shot, a security source has said, although it is not clear who opened fire. Anti-Morsi protesters were on the . streets of Cairo and elsewhere in the country today - the second . anniversary of one of the bloodiest days in the revolution that ended . Mubarak's rule in 2011. Funerals have also been held today for some of those killed in the recent clashes. Hundreds of mourners carried the coffins of six people killed in clashes in Port Said  on Sunday. Opponents of Mr Morsi have spent weeks . camped in the square in protest at the president, who they say has . betrayed the revolution that overthrew Mubarak two years ago. Ibrahim Eissa, a 26-year-old cook, said: 'We want to bring down the regime and end the state that is run by the Muslim Brotherhood.' Mr Morsi declared the state of . emergency in a televised address yesterday and warned that he would not . hesitate to take more action to stem Egypt's latest eruption of . violence. But he denied his latest moves would plunge the country back into authoritarianism. He said: 'There is no going back on freedom, democracy and the supremacy of the law.' Protesters and football fans clashed with riot police after the news of the death sentences of the football riot suspects were announced . A protester lies injured on the ground following the latest clashes with riot police . Mr Morsi has invited the nation's political forces . to a talks today to try and resolve the latest crisis. The . main opposition National Salvation Front coalition has refused to meet because it says the proposal was not genuine. Members said the group will only attend future talks if a list of conditions are met. Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading member of the National Salvation Front, told a news conference the Islamist leader's call was 'cosmetic and not substantive'. The coalition's conditions included a demand that Mr Mursi accept responsibility for the recent bloodshed. Some members had already said dialogue would be a 'waste of time' before the coalition met to discuss whether to join in. Hamdeen Sabahy, a leftist politician . and presidential candidate, said he would not attend Monday's meeting . 'unless the bloodshed stops and the people's demands are met.' Supporters and opponents of President Mohammed Morsi also clashed with one another as violence continued into a fourth day on Sunday . An Egyptian protester kicks a live tear gas canister into a fire during clashes with riot police in Cairo on Sunday. More than 50 people have died in the recent spate of violence that began last week . The Front has distanced itself from the latest flare-ups but said Morsi should have acted far sooner to impose extra security measures that would have ended the violence and blamed him for the escalation. 'Of course we feel the president is missing the real problem on the ground, which is his own polices,' spokesman Khaled Dawoud said. 'His call to implement emergency law was an expected move given what is going on, namely thuggery and criminal actions.' Mr Morsi has not said what he plans to do to stem the violence in other parts of the country. But he offered condolences to families of those that have died and said: 'The protection of the nation is the responsibility of everyone. We will confront any threat to its security with force and firmness within the remit of the law.' As well as Cairo, violence has also been reported in several cities in the Nile Delta region, including the industrial city of Mahallah. The spark of the violence was the . conviction on Saturday of 21 people involved in a riot in Port Said's . main stadium on February 1 last year - the worst football violence in . Egypt's history. Most of those sentenced to death were local fans. The latest violence has come after a court handed a death sentence to 21 people involved in the football riots last year that left 74 dead . Supporters of ousted president Hosni Mubarak were blamed for instigating the riots, in which parts of the Port Said stadium were set on fire .","Masked man learns low-slung jeans are not appropriate for protesting in .

Convicted sex offenders are continuing to live near a 'ready supply of available targets' by moving close to schools despite new laws designed to keep them away from children, it was revealed today. A new study has found that paedophiles and sexual predators move far more often than the general U.S. population, with a high proportion of them relocating to banned zones. For a new book, Crime Modeling and Mapping Using Geospatial Technologies, researchers tracked the movements of more than 1,000 sex offenders in Hamilton County, Ohio, from 2005 to 2007. Still a problem: Dangerous sex offenders are continuing to live near schools despite new laws designed to keep them away from children, a new study has claimed (file picture) They found 65.2 per cent changed homes over that period compared to just 13.6 per cent of non-convicts who moved in 2007. Of the most dangerous offenders, classed as sexual predators, more than 35 per cent moved into school zones, while just 31.9 per cent of less serious 'sexually orientated offenders' chose to do so. Some offenders already lived in school areas at the start of the study and simply moved to one to another, it was reported by www.buzzfeed.com. Lead researcher Alan Murray said the study revealed a 'preference by offenders to reside in areas that have been deemed off limits by enacted residential laws'. Moving near potential targets: The research found that more than 35 per cent of the most dangerous offenders, classed as sexual predators, moved into school zones during the course of the study (file picture) This, he said, may 'indicate strategic movements to areas with a ready supply of available targets'. But the book acknowledges that offenders might simply prefer these areas because they may have better access to rehabilitation facilities. Crackdown: Megan's law was brought in after the death of seven-year-old Megan Kanka (above) who was raped and murdered by a neighbour who had two previous convictions for sexual assault . The study authors claim the results show . that increasingly stringent laws aimed at keeping offenders away from . school areas were still allowing them to 'move freely about communities' and thereby giving residents and politicians a false sense of security. California became the first state to have a sex offender registration program in 1947, but it was nearly 50 years later before community notification of convicts came into force. In 1994, the Jacob Wetterling Act required all 50 states to force sex offenders to register with state registries. Then, two years later, the so-called Megan's Law required law enforcement authorities to make information available to the public. The changes were brought in following the death of seven-year Megan Kanka, who was raped and murdered by neighbour Jesse Timmendequas, who had two previous convictions for sexually assaulting young girls. The law is enacted and enforced on a state-by-state basis, but most restrict where convicts can live after their release from prison. Many prevent residency within 300-600m of schools and daycare centres. In 2007, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act implemented new uniform requirements across the states, including a new national registry. All 50 states have since passed laws requiring sex offenders, especially paedophiles, to register with police and report where they live after leaving prison.","35% of most dangerous offenders moved into school zones from 2005-2007 .

Amanda Wheeler was found guilty of four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual assault . A mother who molested three boys after  consuming enough alcohol to 'knock out a bull elephant' walked free from court today. Amanda Wheeler, 31, downed vodka, beer and wine at a friend's birthday party before kissing and groping a 12-year-old boy on a bench. She then performed a lap-dance and straddled a group of teenage boys. The part-time cleaner also bit a 13-year-old boy on his neck and persuaded him to perform a sex act on her. The mother-of-three denied four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual assault but was found guilty following a two-week trial in October at Worcester Crown Court. Today, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said he did not believe the incident on November 29, 2011, 'arose out of paedophilia' but was a 'one-off'. Wheeler, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was given a two-year prison sentence suspended for two years at Birmingham Crown Court. Judge Thomas said the three boys had made a full recovery 'from what could have been extraordinarily traumatic experiences'. However, he told Wheeler she 'should be ashamed' of herself for pleading not guilty as he said the quantity of alcohol she had drunk meant she could not dispute the testimony of the boys. He told the court: 'It is a highly unusual and very difficult case. 'I'm satisfied that this behaviour arose not out of paedophilia, although these were paedophile acts, but out of drunkenness, selfishness and a real element of childishness on your part. 'You were grossly disinhibited but I don't think that in you there is a tendency or proclivity towards this sort of behaviour and because of this I can regard it as a one-off. 'The aggravating features are the age of the children, the presence of other children during the offending itself and the fact that you were drunk and out of control. 'It is right to say that they show that the major impact on the children came from all of this coming to light and the embarrassment and difficulties that caused them at the time.' He said the victims had made it clear they were 'over whatever trauma' they felt when they made statements in April 2012. Judge Patrick Thomas told Wheeler she should 'be ashamed of herself' for pleading not guilty but said he was satisfied it was a 'one-off' as he gave a her suspended prison sentence at Birmingham Crown Court . The judge added: 'It is because and only . because of the victim impact statements and the impact of the sentence . to be served upon your children that I think it is appropriate to step . back and suspend the sentence.' During the trial, the court heard Wheeler could not remember parts of the night she attended the party near Worcester, because of the 'extraordinary' amount of alcohol she had consumed. Samantha Forsyth, defending, said her client had 'very significant gaps in her memory'. Judge Thomas criticised Wheeler for her 'out-of-control' actions. He told her: 'The evidence established very clearly that on that night you got paralytically drunk and that your behaviour with some children passed beyond the flirtatious to the point where you touched them indecently. 'This was a significant and serious offence. 'You fought the case and you should frankly be ashamed of yourself for refusing to accept that your memory of the matter was such that you really couldn't dispute what the boys consistently said.' Wheeler was acquitted of a sixth charge of sexual activity with a child. She was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for ten years.","Amanda Wheeler, from Cheltenham, kissed and groped a 12-year-old boy .

Oceanographer Dr Tim Boyd, 54, died after being hit by a bolt of lightning on Sunday as he walked his dog . A scientist has died after apparently being struck by lightning as he walked his dog. Internationally respected oceanographer Dr Tim Boyd, 54, was found by a passer-by after being hit by a bolt on the Jubilee Bridge, near his home in Port Appin, Argyll, on Sunday. Emergency services were called but they were unable to save the American-born scientist. The father-of-two worked at the Scottish Association of Marine Science (Sams) in Oban. It is the second tragedy to hit the association in just over a week. Christopher Bell, 24, a PhD student who worked at Sams, was one of four people killed in the Glencoe avalanche on January 19. A spokesman for the association said they are 'grief-stricken about the tragic death' of Dr Boyd. He said: 'We suffer deep pain and confusion to lose such a lively and warm friend and colleague. 'Our . hearts go out in particular to his wife and his two talented daughters . he was so very, very proud of. Our thoughts are with his family.' Dr Boyd joined Sams in 2007 from Oregon State University and was a well-respected physical oceanographer 'with internationally recognised expertise in Arctic oceanography'. The association spokesman added: 'Thanks to his outgoing personality and easy-going nature he established himself quickly as a key researcher at Sams. 'Tim was also a talented lecturer who will be sorely missed by his students.

The . colleague told the Daily Record: 'We were just trying to get to grips . with the news of the death of Chris in the avalanche and now Tim has . died as well. 'It's two awful tragedies - and our thoughts obviously go out to the families of both Chris and Tim.'

Britons have been urged to help prevent thousands of homes being flooded during the big thaw - by building an army of snowmen. With much of the country blanketed in white during the recent cold snap, families have been out in force to make sculptures in the snow, and the Government wants to see even more built, for reasons of function as well as fun. With temperatures expected to swing from -13C to 13C at the weekend, the Environment Agency suggested that snow and ice compacted into snowmen might melt more slowly than that left lying on the ground. Fun AND functional: Building a snowman could help to prevent homes being flooded during the expected thaw at the weekend, the Environment Agency says . Spokesman Roy Stokes said the slowing down the melt will mean there is less surface water come the time of a thaw. 'Ideally if everybody built themselves a snowman that will slow the thaw down a bit,' he said. 'If you notice when people clear their drive the snow thaws away but the compacted piles stay which will give a balanced thaw, which would be helpful.' 'We would rather it be a gradual thaw than a really quick one. 'If it does go too quick we are likely to see a few flood alerts. If you are at risk of flooding make sure you have got all of your planning in place,' Mr Stokes added. Just doing our bit: Snow and ice will melt more slowly if it is compacted into snowmen than if it is simply lying on the ground . Fighting the flood: Weather experts have predicted a sudden thaw when temperatures swing from -13C to 13C at the weekend . Dr Simon Keeling, forecaster at weatherweb.net, warned that localised flooding was likely to follow the thaw. 'There is going to be a big swing in temperatures, from as low as -13C on Friday night to 13C on Tuesday,' he said. 'It will be really noticeable, and as the majority of England, Scotland and Wales is under a layer of snow there will be a lot of standing water around. 'We will see a lot of standing water around so there is likely to be localised flooding and driving conditions will not be good. 'We are going to see a rise in temperatures next week followed by a cooling period again, but nothing like the freeze we have seen lately,' he added. A spokesman for the Environment Agency later said Mr Stokes was joking and added: 'While building snowmen is great fun, sadly it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the overall rate at which the snow melts. 'The most important thing anyone can do to protect themselves from flooding is to check out if they are in a flood risk area, and sign up to free flood warnings on the Environment Agency website.'","Weather forecasters are predicted a sudden thaw when temperatures swing from -13C to 13C at the weekend .

The school's head teacher Ruth Jackson says children are thriving in the Christian environment . A church primary school now has more Muslim pupils in each class than Christians. St Mary The Virgin Primary School, in Butetown, Cardiff, has been run for more than 100 years by the church in the Welsh city's former docklands - and children are thriving in the diverse environment, which allows everyone to pray together, regardless of faith. The latest inspection report of the school in Butetown shows that out of 181 pupils 90 per cent come from an ethnic minority background. The school was described as 'excellent' by inspectors with 73 per cent speak an additional language as well as English. It is the only school run by the Church in Wales which has less Christian pupils than Muslims on its register. Headteacher Ruth Jackson said: 'We are unique as we are a Church school where the majority of pupils are Muslim. 'We have an ethos of tolerance and respect and shared values. 'Everyone prays together and there is also time for pupils to follow their own faith. 'The spiritual and moral development of the pupils is a priority.' Many of the children aged three to 11 are from Yemeni and Somali backgrounds - with many of the parents refugees who move to the area. Some of the pupils speak no English when they arrive but are thriving in the Christian environment. Mrs Jackson added: 'This is an absolutely fantastic result which reflects the hard work and dedication of the whole school community.' The report praised the 'inclusive' environment which allowed pupils to flourish and gave them the space to practice their own faith . Inspectors said many were 'outperforming all expectations, making exemplary progress with good literacy and numeracy.' It also said an 'inclusive' environment allowed pupils to flourish and gave them the space to practice their own faith. Other . nationalities in the school include Saudi Arabian and Bangladeshi - . with all having to learn to speak Welsh as well as English. Reporting inspector Terwyn Tomas said: 'Pupils generally enter the school with skill levels that are considerably lower than average. 'As they progress through the school, pupils make excellent progress and achieve at a level significantly higher than predicted by their earlier attainment.

Michael Jackson's former private doctor is being sued by a female patient who claims he sexually assaulted her during an examination. Dr Allan Metzger, who testified at the manslaughter trial of the late pop star's other physician Conrad Murray, is accused of groping the woman's breasts during a check-up last year. In a lawsuit filed at the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Victoria Oliver claims he described her body during one exam as 'delicious'. 'Groped patient': Michael Jackson's former doctor Allan Metzger (pictured here giving evidence in the manslaughter trial of Conrad Murray) has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman during a check-up . In another, she claims Metzger placed his hands under her blouse. When she protested, she alleges he responded by saying: 'Why don't we close the door and really have some fun.' Oliver claims the doctor then snuck around behind her and groped her breasts from behind while pressing himself against her body. Oliver is suing for unspecified damages, saying she felt humiliated and still suffers emotional distress, it was reported on TMZ.com. Metzger has not yet responded to a request for comment. Metzger treated Jackson earlier in his career and even videotaped the singer's wedding to Debbie Rowe. He also met with Jackson once in the months before he died. Accused: Metzger, pictured with his grandson Kailen and Jackson in 2003, says he treated the pop star for 15 years and told during the Murray trial how he refused to give the singer hospital anaethestic to help him sleep . Defense attorneys for Murray, who was convicted of killing the superstar, called him as a witness in the trial to try to show the singer was attempting to obtain a powerful anesthetic for home use. But despite being a defense witness, Metzger aided prosecutors by telling jurors that he refused Jackson's request and warned him of the risks. During the trial in October 2011, Metzger claimed to have treated Jackson for between 15 and 20 years and told how he refused the singer's pleas to administer hospital anaesthetic so he could sleep. He said he'd treated Jackson over the years for anxiety and sleep disorders. 'Sleep was the issue, particularly after performing. He could not come down,' said Metzger during the case. He said Jackson asked him for 'intravenous sleep medicine' in April 2009. 'I think he used the word ""juiced"",' he said. 'He didn't believe that any oral medicine would be helpful. He wanted some form of anaesthetic.' The doctor told the jury at Los Angeles Superior Court that no amount of money would have persuaded him to grant the singer's request. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for causing Jackson's death at the age of 50 by giving him a lethal dose of the sedative Propofol.","Dr Allan Metzger also described woman's body as 'delicious', lawsuit claims .

Despite the Brazilians' reputation for partying, Britain has more fun than its carnival-loving rival. The British - usually portrayed as reserved - also have more fun than the Dutch and French, according to a new study. But while they may enjoy more fun than some of their European neighboughers, Germans are having more fun than us, while the Argentines are having more fun than anyone. Brazilians may have their famous carnival, but Britain's Notting Hill Carnival can rival it for fun . But the average Polish person has the least fun out of the 17 countries ranked, according to the poll. The average young Briton, has fun 11.3 days a month – slightly more than young Brazilians, on 10.9 days, but far less than young Argentines, who have fun nearly 15 days a month, according to social network Badoo. Louise Thompson, a spokesman for Badoo said: 'If there were a World Cup for Fun, the famously fun-loving Brazilians would surely start favourites. 'Yet, we British, not famed as funsters, turn out to be having more fun than they are.' 'The Brazilians have Samba dancing, while we have Morris Dancing. They have Copacabana beach, while we have Bridlington-on-Sea. Brazil's beaches may offer some stunning sights - but the UK has more fun, according to the survey . 'But then we also have Monty Python, Mr Bean and The Office and are one of the world’s greatest exporters of comedy.' Country              Days having fun . Badoo asked 17,000, mainly young people in 17 countries and four continents: 'How often do you really have fun and a good time (such as when going out socially or seeing friends?)' The British came eighth of the 17 nationalities ranked. While we have slightly more fun than both the Brazilians and the French, and race ahead of the Polish, who have least fun of anyone. Among the study’s other surprise findings is that the supposedly fun-shy Germans in fact report having more fun (12.1 days a month) than do the famously fun-loving Brazilians (10.9 days) or us (11.3). Americans come to a respectable sixth in the world rankings. Young Americans average nearly 12 days (11.7) of fun a month. This places them ahead of Canadians, their neighbours to the north, on 10 (9.9) days, and of us, but well behind Mexicans, their southern neighbours, on nearly 14 (13.7) days. A 'happiness map of Britain' shows how mothers living in the UK's most remote spots are among the happiest people in the country - as a study in November found women are generally more content than men. The report also showed women appear to experience more anxiety and found geographical ‘hotspots’ where people could expect a better life, singling out the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland.

A DIY fanatic who joked he had a 'secret garden' had built a 12ft cannabis factory underneath his patio. Neighbours were completely unaware, David Mundy, 54, had secretly burrowed into land next to his home and built the underground factory to grow marijuana plants. The residents of Barr Hill Avenue, Salford, even said he joked about the 'secret garden' when asked about the amount of DIY work he was carrying out. Secret garden: David Mundy built a secret underground cannabis factory under his patio . Police only discovered the underground factory following a tip-off, with a secret entrance that could only be accessed by a set of hidden ladders. Officers found  17 plants growing in the underground 12ft square lair with a street value of more than £8,000. Manchester Crown Court heard Mundy had used electricity from his £140,000 semi-detached home to power the shed and used flagstones to cover up the entrance. There was also a sophisticated hydroponic irrigation system complete with extraction ducts. The electricity supply rigged up to his own home supplied light, water and air filtration. Mundy was ordered to pay back £13,480 within six months during a Proceeds of Crime hearing at Manchester Crown Court yesterday. Busted: Inside the underground cannabis farm which was built beneath David Mundy's back garden . The married father-of-one was convicted of producing a Class B drug at an earlier hearing and was given a 15 week imprisonment suspended for two years and ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work. If he does not pay back the money with six months, he faces 12 months in jail. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Riddick, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Mundy went to considerable lengths - quite literally - to keep his cannabis farm hidden. 'What we discovered was an underground drugs den housed within a storage unit, and must have taken him many hours to build, hours that should have been spent earning his money legitimately like the rest of us do. Down at the bottom of the garden: The home in Salford, Greater Manchester, where David Mundy constructed an underground cannabis factory . 'If you think you can bury your criminality underground, you are burying your head in the sand because we will find you and we will do everything we can to take away not only your liberty but also your illegally accumulated wealth.' Mundy declined to comment at his home and refused to open his front door. But one neighbour said: 'We couldn't believe it when we heard what had happened. 'He's a bit of a DIY fanatic and we noticed him doing some renovation work because all the flagstones had been taken up and were stored outside his house. 'We asked what he was up to and he cracked some joke about having a secret garden. We were obviously none the wiser at that time as to what he meant by that.

This is the dramatic moment that the lights went out in the middle of the Super Bowl on Sunday night, leaving officials looking out over 71,000 football fans with baffled expressions. A TV network had been holding an interview behind-the scenes at the Superdome control room in New Orleans when a power cut rippled around the stadium. An eerie calm descended in the tower as the 35-minute power cut set in. Officials maintained a grip on their emotions despite the fact there appeared to be little clue as to what was going on. Scroll down for video . Illuminated: 60 Minutes interviewer Armen Keteyian was conducting a behind-the-scenes interviewer with top Superdome official on Sunday night shortly after Beyoncé's half-time show . Lights out! As the interview wrapped up at the control room in the New Orleans stadium, the moment power went out was caught live on camera . Sportscaster Armen Keteyian was conducting an interview with top Superdome official Frank Supovitz for CBS shortly after Beyoncé's half-time show during the game between the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens. The pair were discussing how the superstar's performance had over-run by three minutes and were wrapping up the interview when floodlights around the top of the Superdome cut out, plunging thousands of fans and players on the field into darkness. At first, Supovitz calmly announced 'Alright, we lost lights' before another official says 'we're going to a manual override'. The mood became tense as officials struggled to get an idea of what had happened. Doug Thornton, a senior official for SMG who own the Superdome, then told Supovitz: 'Frank, we lost the A feed.' Supovitz replied: 'What does that mean?' Thornton added: 'That means that we have to do the bus time?' before Supovitz again asked: 'What does that mean?' Only then does Thornton explain there will be a likely 20-minute delay. Stress: One official clutches his head as the team in the control room scrambled to work out why the power had cut . Uh-oh: Questions remain as to why the lights blew at the Super Bowl 2013 with officials simply saying it was down to an 'abnormality' in the power system . Questions remain over exactly what . caused the stadium to plunge into darkness in the third . quarter of the game, with officials simply saying that it was due to an . 'abnormality' in the power system. Beyoncé was let off the hook on Monday after she was earlier made scapegoat when she allegedly blew the electrics twice during rehearsals for her spectacular half-time performance. The problem occurred shortly after the superstar's show, leaving many wondering whether extravagant lighting and video effects were to blame, while others questioned whether New Orleans' infrastructure was still suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Public records released on Monday . show that Superdome officials were worried about a power outage several . months before the big game. An . October 15 memo released by the Louisiana Stadium & Exposition . District, which oversees the Superdome, says tests on the dome's . electrical feeders showed they had 'some decay and a chance of failure'. Blowout performance? Beyoncé's dazzling performance was earlier suggested to be the cause of the power cut but was later found not to blame . Entergy New Orleans, the company that . supplies the stadium with power, and the structure's engineering staff . 'had concerns regarding the reliability of the Dome service from . Entergy's connection point to the Dome,' the memo says. Those . concerns were due in part to 'circumstances that have previously . occurred with the electrical service regarding transient spikes and . loads'. The memo also cites 2011 blackouts . that struck Candlestick Park, where the San Francisco 49ers were playing . a nationally televised on Monday night football game, as a reason for . ordering the tests. The . board later authorized spending nearly $1 million on Superdome . improvements, including more than $600,000 for upgrading the dome's . electrical feeder cable system. 'As discussed in previous board . meetings, this enhancement is necessary to maintain both the Superdome . and the New Orleans Arena as top tier facilities, and to ensure that we . do not experience any electrical issues during the Super Bowl,' says a . LSED document dated December 19. Darkness descends: Only some floodlights remained in use during a blackout for 35minutes at the Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday night . In the balance: A Ravens cheerleader performs for the crowd in the near-pitch darkness at the Super Bowl . An attorney for the state board that . oversees the Superdome said the blackout did not appear to be related to . the replacement in December of electrical equipment connecting the . stadium to Entergy. Officials with the utility and the Superdome noted . that an NFL game, the Sugar Bowl and another bowl game were played there . in recent weeks with no apparent problems. The exact cause of Sunday night's . blackout - and who's to blame - remained unclear late on Monday, though a . couple of potential culprits had been ruled out. It wasn't Beyonce's electrifying . halftime performance, according to Doug Thornton, manager of the . state-owned Superdome, since the singer had her own generator. And it apparently wasn't a case of . too much demand for power. Meters showed the 76,000-seat stadium was . drawing no more electricity than it does during a typical New Orleans . Saints game, Thornton said. Brought to a halt: Baltimore Ravens players look around the Superdome after the lights went out during the second half of NFL Super Bowl XLVII f . Tensions: San Francisco 49ers offensive lineman Daniel Kilgore, right, sits on the sidelines during the 35-minute power outage . The . lights-out game on Sunday proved an embarrassment for New Orleans just . when it was hoping to show the rest of the world how far it has come . since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But many fans and residents were . forgiving, and officials expressed confidence that the episode wouldn't . hurt the city's hopes of hosting the championship again. To New Orleans' great relief, NFL . Commissioner Roger Goodell said the city did a 'terrific' job hosting . its first pro-football championship in the post-Hurricane Katrina era, . and added: 'I fully expect that we will be back here for Super Bowls.' Fans watching from their living rooms . weren't deterred, either. An estimated 108.4 million television viewers . saw the Baltimore Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31, making it . the third most-viewed program in television history. Both the 2010 and . 2011 games hit the 111 million mark. The problem that caused the outage . was believed to have happened around the spot where a line that feeds . current from Entergy New Orleans connects with the Superdome's . electrical system, officials said. But whether the fault lay with the . utility or with the Superdome was not clear. Determining the cause will probably . take days, according to Dennis Dawsey, a vice president for distribution . and transmission for Entergy. He said the makers of some of the . switching gear have been brought in to help figure out what happened. The blackout came after a nearly flawless week of activity for football fans in New Orleans leading up to the big game. Faulty: A referee gestures to players as the field was plunged into darkness at the start of the third quarter . 'I hope that's not what they'll remember about this Super Bowl,' French Quarter artist Gloria Wallis said. 'I hope that what they'll remember is they had a great time here and that they were welcomed here.' Ravens fan Antonio Prezioso, a Baltimore native who went to the game with his 11-year-old son, said the outage just extended the experience. 'The more time we could spend at the game was a good thing, as long as it ended the way it did,' he said, laughing. The city last hosted the Super Bowl in 2002, and officials were hoping this would serve as the ultimate showcase for the city's recovery since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm tore holes in the roof of the Superdome and caused water damage to its electrical systems, and more than $330 million was spent repairing and upgrading the stadium. Sunday's Super Bowl was New Orleans' 10th as host, and officials plan to make a bid for an 11th in 2018. Mayor Mitch Landrieu told WWL-AM on Monday that the outage won't hurt the city's chances, and he joked that the game got better after the blackout: 'People were leaving and the game was getting boring, so we had to do a little something to spice it up.' The chairwoman of the New Orleans City Council's Utility Committee has called an emergency meeting for Friday to discuss the power outage. Jarvis DeBerry, a columnist for nola.com and The Times-Picayune, wrote that the power outage gave the media 'an opportunity to laugh at the apparent ineptitude or suggest that the ghosts of Hurricane Katrina were haunting the Superdome'. 'That's not the kind of attention the city was looking for, obviously,' he wrote, 'but it's certainly too soon to say if people will remember the power shortage over San Francisco's furious comeback attempt against Baltimore or if this will harm the city's future opportunities to host the Super Bowl'.","TV cameras caught the moment when the power went out at New Orleans stadium at beginning of third quarter .

Locked up: Rogue tradesman Jason Costner, 41, threatened and intimidated frightened elderly customers into paying for unfinished work . A 'drunken' builder who threatened frightened elderly customers into paying for unfinished work has been jailed. Rogue tradesman Jason Costner left a 73-year-old man with a hole in his roof over a snowy Christmas, and a 77-year-old woman with no water for five months. The 41-year-old problem drinker, of Saltburn, North Yorkshire, was locked up for 18 months at Teesside Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to ten charges of fraud. Recorder Brian Cox told Costner: 'You were threatening and offensive, and it is clear from the evidence that the complainants were intimidated by you and you must have been aware of that. These were elderly, vulnerable victims.' Prosecutor Rebecca Brown said the pair of pensioners were taken in by his offers to do work for them. Costner told the man that he would repair his roof for free, although he ended up paying a total of £1,876. He began by saying that the roof needed re-pointing, during which he broke a window and he charged him £145 for a new frame. Costner said that it also needed new tiles and lead flashing, which he failed to complete. Miss Brown said that the roof was left exposed over Christmas 2010 during heavy snow, and when Costner spoke to the man's insurers he pocketed the £750 payout. No work was done, and Costner told him that scaffolding was needed. The man handed over more money but nothing appeared. The man finally hired somebody else to finish the job, and it was completed in a day for just £60. The woman, who had known Costner when he was her window cleaner, ended up paying him £520 after she asked him to fix her television aerial. She needed work done in her bathroom, and Costner removed the tiles and pulled the sink away from the wall. Miss Brown said: 'For five months she was without water, having to wash herself in the kitchen, and she was without a television.' Costner was warned by police for harassing the man in February 2011, and arrested for fraud in September 2011. Rod Hunt, defending, said that Costner was not a typical confidence trickster from outside the area who targeted vulnerable people. Mr Hunt said the offences happened in a drunken, chaotic manner after the breakdown of his relationship. Recorder Cox QC also imposed a two-year restraining order banning Costner from contacting the vulnerable OAPs, who have homes in Guisborough.","Rogue tradesman Jason Costner pleaded guilty to ten charges of fraud .

Dorothy, from Windsor, Berkshire, first became a champion pole vaulter in 1991, but she won gold again in 2012 and is the current world champion in the 75 to 80 age group category. The pensioner has competed at every World Masters and European Masters event since 1991, which are both held annually, taking a medal at every single games. She says she has at least 42 medals and estimates at least 35 of them are gold. The sprightly OAP most recently won gold for heptathlon at the European Masters Championships in Poland in 2006, when she was 70. Despite being in her late 70s, Dorothy has now taken up Usain Bolt's event - the 100m outdoor sprint - and is hoping to smash the record at the British Masters Championships at the end of February by the running the race in 16 seconds.

Her athletic talents have seen her travel all over the world to compete - from Australia and Japan to America - and most of the countries in Europe. 'It's a great thrill travelling around the world and entering all these competitions, it keeps me feeling alive - and it certainly beats sitting around the house doing nothing. 'I had never been very interested in running in my younger days, and I always thought I was too old to take it up.

I've visited countries and cities I would never had the chance to otherwise when I've competed there. 'We don't get any funding, which is a shame, because older people have a lot to offer. 'I've been pole vaulting for more than 20 years, and it is starting to get a bit hard on my joints, so I'm going to focus on my sprinting instead. 'I had to do a lot of sprint training for pole vault, so it seemed like the natural thing for me to do next. 'I train with a lovely group of people, under my son, Stephen. I don't get any special treatment, though, when we're at training, I'm just Dorothy the pole vaulter. 'It's the only time I let him tell me what to do. 'My family and friends are all very proud of me, they're used to me nipping off to training and spending my weekends competing. 'Some people might think it's an odd thing for someone in their 70s to be doing, but I'll stick with athletics as long as I can keep going.

When, eighty-five years ago, 21-year-old Kathleen Thomas declared her intention to swim the treacherous Bristol Channel between Wales and England, the world thought she was mad. The distance is 11 miles as the crow flies - but more often calculated as 22-and-a-half once the water's brutal currents are taken into account. The stretch of water which links . Penarth to Weston-super-Mare had a fearsome reputation due to its lethal tides, caused by scattered headlands and islands funnelling enormous volumes of tidal water through small spaces. Many men had attempted the challenge and failed. Kathleen Thomas, the first person to swim the Bristol Channel, with her swimming trophy . And then, just two years later, in 1929, a 16-year-old . schoolgirl named Edith Parnell declared she would emulate Kathleen and try her hand at the same perilous swim. Remarkably, both of these women succeeded in their challenge, and Kathleen became the first swimmer to ever complete the task, remaining in the Guinness Boook of Records until the 1990s. Now a fellow wild-swimmer, Catherine Jones, has paid tribute to these two extraordinary athletes who were dismissed by locals at the time as 'mere women' who would never have the strength or stamina to go the distance. Jones has written a book, The Wonder Girls, published by Simon & Schuster, to tell the oft-forgotten  story of these pioneering 'lady swimmers' of the 1920s, who defied convention - in an age when the expectation for women was simply marriage and motherhood - with ambition. A photo from 1929 shows Edith Parnell, then 16, being pulled out of the water aftr her swim by a friend . Recounting the day when Kathleen completed the challenge, Ms Jones said: 'At 4.15am on September 5, 1927, Kathleen Thomas stood on the beach at Penarth, a small seaside town just outside Cardiff, in a black Wolsey bathing costume and submarine cap, intent on swimming from South Wales to Somerset. 'The Suffragettes were campaigning for women’s rights, but nobody thought a girl could cross to the other side - many men had tried and failed.' Critics said a 'mere woman' should never attempt such a feat. In fact, following their story announcing Kathleen’s intention, the local newspaper had been obliged to print the following clarification because no one believed the original article: 'Miss Kathleen Thomas, the Penarth lady swimmer, whose decision to attempt the Bristol Channel was exclusively reported in yesterday’s South Wales Echo, reaffirmed in an interview today that our report was correct in its entirety.' Kathleen Thomas recovering after her swim across the Bristol Channlel - she was, on 5 September 1927 - the first person ever to complete the swim . Ms Jones continued: 'Crowds lined the beach to watch Kathleen wade into the chill grey waters, accompanied by a launch containing representatives from the Welsh Amateur Swimming Association and a rowing boat carrying her uncle Jack in a bowler hat. 'Seven hours and 20 minutes later she reached the shores of Somerset; fortified by beef tea and chocolate, Thomas received a rapturous welcome from the West Country. She was the first person, as well as the first woman, to swim the Bristol Channel. 'Compelling images from newspapers of the time show her exhausted, slumped in a boat, before she was taken to a hotel where she had a warm and cold bath, a half-hour rest in bed, and a good fish lunch before returning to Wales a celebrity.' Kathleen thomas is helped into a boat following her exhausting 7hr 20min swim . Kathleen's triumph being celebrated by local dignitaries in Penrath . Two years later a plucky teenager named Edith Parnell took 10 hours, 17 minutes and 10 seconds to make the crossing, becoming the second person to successfully swim the channel. When she arrived at the finish line in Penarth a police constable escorted her . through cheering crowds to the tune of 'See the Conquering Hero Comes'. Ms Jones continued: 'At a reception in the Pier Pavilion, the council's chairman told the . audience they were especially proud of Miss Parnell who had displayed ""amazing pluck in enduring for over ten hours one of the biggest trials . that could be demanded of any athlete, man or woman"".'

Though locals at the time campaigned for monuments of remembrance after the women had completed their challenges, it was not until 2007 was Kathleen's achievement was marked by a plaque on Penarth seafront. After Kathleen's triumph, a letter from a person named J.

Revealing: Meg Hillier said anger had been fuelled by reports that MPs were demanding a pay rise . Politicians are pressing for state regulation of the Press as direct revenge for the expenses scandal, a former minister warned yesterday. Labour MP Meg Hillier said some MPs were willing to use the power of Parliament ‘to bad effect’ in order to get back at the Press. Miss Hillier, a former journalist, said anger had been fuelled by reports last month that MPs were demanding a 32 per cent pay rise - with one MP telling her personally that they now backed state regulation. In an interview with Press Gazette she said: ‘The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority had done this rather bizarre survey asking MPs what we should be paid. ‘So this was published and papers reported it as: “These fat cat MPs all think they should be paid 20 per cent more”. Which was not the case - but that was what the survey sort of suggested - it wasn’t entirely accurate, it was an extrapolation from the survey. ‘And this MP said to me, “well... I wasn’t going to vote for statutory underpinning, but I’m minded now to do so.” If that happens on something as little as one storm in a teacup story about a little survey of 100 MPs on their salaries, and the coverage of that, what if there is something more? ‘That shows you that the psychology exists in the pack of (not all of the) 650 MPs... that there can be a desire to use the powers that are there to bad effect.’ Miss Hillier said she disagreed with Ed Miliband’s demand for new laws on Press regulation, adding: ‘I just think we have to have a look at where we want to be in 20, 30, 40, 50 years’ time. And once you do this it’s very hard to unwind it.’ Speaking yesterday she said the agenda was also driven partly by a ‘very anti-Murdoch feeling among some of my colleagues’. Miss Hillier said the media also had a duty to demonstrate that it was willing to act more responsibly in the future. Meg Hiller added the agenda was also driven partly by a 'very anti-Murdoch feeling among some of my colleagues' But she called for politicians to support a free Press - arguing that an unregulated Internet would result in a worse situation. ‘Of course we get criticised in politics,’ she said. ‘I don’t mind as long as it is accurate, and I do think the media has to do more to stand up for good standards. ‘Everyone should be wary of a world where we have to rely on Internet bloggers for news. But if we don’t have a good, professional media we will just have more bloggers.’","Meg Hillier said anger fuelled by reports that MPs were demanding a pay rise .

'Troubled': Daniel Carter, 19, attacked a 16-year-old girl just one week after being released early from prison for abducting a 10-year-old girl . A thug carried out a terrifying attack on a 16-year-old girl in an alleyway just a week after being released early from prison for abducting a 10-year-old girl. Daniel Carter, 19, grabbed the teenager and threatened to kill her unless she handed over her mobile phone. The attack happened just 30 minutes after Carter, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, had met with his probation officer to discuss the terms of his early release from prison. He was let out on licence on November 9 last year after serving just half of his 32-month sentence for abducting a 10-year-old girl in a park. Carter was jailed for the sickening attack in July 2011 when he grabbed the girl in Central Forest Park in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and held her hostage while her parents searched for her frantically. He covered the girl's mouth with his hand . and hid in bushes for 20 minutes before threatening to slit her throat . if she made a noise. But the brave girl managed to escape when . she screamed for help and her dad rushed over to find Carter trying to take pictures of her. Carter, who admitted he was high on cocaine, cannabis and alcohol at the time, was jailed for child abduction. The victim's parents had issued a statement pleading with the judge to order him to serve the whole sentence. But on November 16 - just seven days after he was freed early from prison - he launched the terrifying attack on a second young girl. Carter grabbed the 16-year-old and dragged her more than 10 feet down an alleyway before demanding her mobile phone. Prosecutor David Bennett told the court: 'He said, 'Give me your phone or I will kill you'. The victim was only saved when three men who were walking by saw the attack and wrestled . Carter off the girl before he fled. Scene of the crime: Carter's first attack took place when he abducted a 10-year-old girl while she was in Central Forest Park, Stoke-on-Trent, with her parents . The frightened victim was found with a sore neck and Carter's blood on her arms and clothes. Jason Holt, defending, described Carter as a troubled young man. He added: 'He says he struggles when he is out of prison. 'He has now got to the stage where he finds solace with a custody environment.' Jailing him for a further 32 months, Judge Granville Styler branded Carter a 'danger to the public'. He told him: 'This is a serious matter. It was a terrifying incident for this young 16-year-old to be attacked at night by you. 'You have a previous serious matter involving a 10-year-old child who you abducted.

An eight-year-old girl who beat cancer is now set to appear in a movie alongside film hunk James McAvoy. Megan Finn auditioned against hundreds of other youngsters to win a role in the adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel 'Filth'. She traveled to Sweden to film her part as the daughter of lead character Bruce Robertson - played by McAvoy. Overcoming adversity: Megan Finn with her on screen parents Shauna MacDonald and James McAvoy in Sweden . Yet just five years ago she was battling cancer, after doctors discovered a tumour on her kidney in 2007. Her parents had taken her to the doctor after noticing a swelling on her side. She was rushed to Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital for tests the same day and a week later they revealed Megan was suffering from a Wilms' tumour - a rare cancer that affects just 70 children in the UK each year. Surgeons removed a 9cm tumour and one of the Megan's kidneys and she then underwent six months of chemotherapy. Megan's mother Lesley, 38, from Houston, Scotland, said: 'We're so proud of Megan - she's been so brave through the whole cancer ordeal. 'And despite facing all the chemotherapy she never stopped smiling.' She added: 'Working . with James McAvoy and Shauna Macdonald was great for her - Megan got on . so well with them and they praised her for her skills. 'Megan . - who is actually quite a shy girl - was able to transform when on set. She really took it in her stride - I was more starstruck than her. 'To . think Megan went through the terrible moment with the kidney tumour, . and chemotherapy, and can emerge such a happy young child is amazing. But she battled through it with such strength.' Recovered: Megan's long locks grew back (l) after she lost them during chemotherapy in 2007 (r) Filming for 'Filth' took place last in 2012 - but Megan won't be allowed to watch it for a few years. The dark movie focuses on bipolar, bigoted, drug addict cop Bruce Robertson who manipulates and hallucinates his way through the festive season in a bid to secure promotion and win back his family. McAvoy plays Bruce and Canadian actress Shauna Macdonald is starring as his wife Carole. Mrs Finn, who is a beauty therapist, said: 'James and Shauna were lovely - the two of them gave Megan a wee parcel with a scarf, two tops and a necklace in it. 'The necklace says 'Forever' and Shauna explained to Megan that she picked it because she is forever on film now she's made her first movie. I thought it was so nice of them.' Megan, who has two sisters, Alex, 10, and Jessica, 6, has also appeared in an advert for kids toy Princess Fuzz as well as a brochure for Stirling Castle. The young actress is still getting plenty of acting practise as she goes to theatre school and attends another theatre and dance group.

Jodi Arias took the stand at her murder trial today and immediately told jurors that she had killed her lover in self-defense. When asked by the defense if she had killed on-off boyfriend Travis Alexander - who was stabbed 27 times and shot in the head - Arias softly said 'Yes'. When asked by defense attorney Kirk . Nurmi why she had killed Alexander at his Mesa home in June . 2008, Arias responded: 'The simple answer is that he attacked me and I defended myself.' Scroll down for video . 'In self-defense': Jodi Arias took the stand in her own defense today and admitted to the jury in Mesa, Arizona that she had killed lover Travis Alexander . The 32-year-old, wearing a black T-shirt and glasses, also revealed to the courtroom in Mesa, Arizona that she had planned to commit suicide shortly after Alexander's death. Arias had said in a TV interview in September 2008 - three months after Alexander was killed in the bloody attack - that 'no jury would ever convict her' of his murder. At the time she claimed it was because she had not killed him but today Arias said she had planned to take her own life. She said today: 'I was very confident that no jury would convict me because I was sure I'd be dead. Those are probably the most bitter words I'll ever eat.' The decision to put Arias on the stand came as a surprise as she faces death row if she's convicted of murdering Alexander. Composed: Arias appeared on the stand today in Arizona where she told the court that she had been repeated beaten by her parents as a child . The defense team for Arias hopes the testimony will show that she killed him in self defense after he mistreated her for months and was possessive. The jury were shown pink panties today with 'Travis' emblazoned across them. A computer forensic examiner testified that he recovered a photo of the underwear on July 12, 2008 more than a month after Alexander was killed. The prosecution questioned the forensics worker as to whether the picture appeared staged but he said he was unaware of the context. However the prosecution says Arias was 'obsessed' with Alexander and flew into a jealous rage when he revealed he wanted to start dating someone else. On the stand today, she was told several times to speak up and move closer to the microphone. Jurors watched Arias closely while some took notes. Arias told the court today that she had been severely beaten as a child by her mother and father when she lived in California and also by the first boyfriend she ever loved. Alexander's family listened in the courtroom as she spoke, some unable to raise their eyes to look at Arias. Alexander's sister Tanisha Sorenson watched every word of Arias' testimony with an unflinching gaze. Arias wept as she told the court: 'I'm very nervous today. Life was ideal up until I was aged seven. Parents would spank us and around seven-years old it started getting more intense. 'My dad started using a belt. My mom began to carry a wooden spoon on her purse.' She continued: 'It was a wooden kitchen spoon and if we misbehaved she would use it on my brother and I, she would hit us hard with it. 'It left welts on my body. Dad didn't leave welts as often as my mom - she also used a belt. My dad was quite intimidating so didn’t need to use strength to get his point across. My mother did.' Volatile relationship: Arias had dated Travis Alexander for five months but continued a casual sexual relationship with him after the split up . Arias was asked in court this afternoon if she loved her mother, to which she quietly responded, 'yes'. She talked at length about the relationship she had with her parents growing up and claimed she was subjected to beatings. 'They were intense and increased in frequency as I got older,' Arias said. 'I don't recall how many times a week but it could be any thing from four times a week to once every two weeks. 'I didn't like being hit so I would squirm around a little but the more we did the harder we would get hit. 'My mother broke my brother's hand once when he tried to block one of her blows. As I got into a teenager, my dad would get rougher and rougher.' She added: 'When I was younger I remember feeling betrayed and confused that my mother was beating me. The accused: Arias is facing the death penalty after her lover Travis Alexander was stabbed 27 times, had his throat cut and was shot in the head at his home in June 2008 . Unflinching gaze: The sister of Travis Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson (left) watches as Jodi Arias admits to killing her brother Travis on the stand today . 'As I got older it made me mad and I didn't get why she was punishing me. I was mad at her and it hurt. I loved her but it put a strain on our relationship. 'My dad never beat me with his fist - he would just shove me into furniture and the piano, tables, desk, chairs, whatever was around. One time I even passed out. 'This was when I was 16 or 17. Not as often with my dad as with my mum. If I did something to upset them it would happen. Sometimes I got grounded. I loved my father even when he was beating me.' Arias told the packed courtroom that the beatings continued throughout the time she was in high school. In one incidence, Arias had sneaked out at night with friends and when her parents woke up and found out, she claimed her father hit her across the face, knocking her to the ground. Jodi's story: The murder suspect described to the court how she was beaten by her parents and an ex-boyfriend . Grief-stricken: Travis Alexander's family have attended throughout the murder trial in Arizona . Following a brief recess on Monday afternoon, Arias returned to the stand where she discussed an earlier relationship in 1999 with a man called Bobby Juarez, who she described as her 'first true love'. She said that she moved in with Juarez because she had become frustrated with her parents and how they treated her. Arias described the relationship as 'good' until Juarez was unfaithful with a girl he met on a partyline 900 number. She also told the jury that the boyfriend once put her in a stranglehold and almost broke her arm during an argument. Following the end of the relationship with Bobby, Arias said that she moved in with her grandparents because she did not want to return to the atmosphere of her parents' house. However Arias said that she resumed a casual, sexual relationship with Arias because she felt the violence was 'isolated incidents'. The trial finished for the day with Arias telling the court of how she later moved in with Juarez's roommate and began a romantic relationship with him. She is expected to return to the stand tomorrow.","Arias, 32, told the Arizona courtroom that she had killed Travis Alexander because 'he attacked me and I defended myself'

Tormented: Patricia Bell was found dead in a pond after her dementia meant she could no longer read . A tormented 85-year-old retired archivist and historian with a ‘great mind’ was found dead in a pond after her dementia meant she could no longer enjoy her beloved books, an inquest was told today. Former county archivist Patricia Bell, of Bedford, Bedfordshire, was found floating face down in the water after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2011 which saw her reading skills diminish. The keen historian was found dead in a pond at Bedford Park last September after drinking gin and becoming ‘distressed’, after making two previous suicide attempts, Bedford Coroner's Court heard. The pensioner’s walking stick, a . handbag and an opened bottle of gin were later found by the side of a . park bench by a gardener close to her body, still floating in the water, . the inquest was told. A . post mortem revealed she had died of immersion - and the shock of . falling in water may have caused cardiac arrest. At the inquest, the . coroner refused to rule out the possibility she had fallen. Despite . her previous suicide bids deputy coroner Bob Amos recorded an open . verdict, saying: ‘Patricia, from what I gather, was a woman of good . intellect and was struggling with ill health. ‘It is fair to say she was not coping with her Alzheimer's and feared being put into a home. ‘Although . I’ve read the letters from friends and heard the words from her carer . about her attempts to take her own life, I cannot say beyond all . responsible doubt that this is a verdict of suicide. ‘Because . of the drink, the ill health and Patricia's age are all factors.

At 7.44am the next day, police were called to the park by a . gardener, who had discovered a body floating in the pond. Ms Bell was found just under twice the legal limit for driving of alcohol in her blood stream. Inquest: Deputy coroner Bob Amos recorded an open verdict yesterday at Bedford Coroner's Court (pictured) Pathologist . Dr Kay Adu-Poku said the cause of death was immersion which had caused . an enlarging of the heart and the secondary cause was breast cancer. But evidence read aloud in court suggested Ms Bell had been upset at the time of her death. 'I had a good friendship of 16 years with Patricia and she had become very unhappy. She was distressed as she wasn't able to read literature anymore - which was her passion' Heather Bailey, Patricia Bell's friend .

The letter read: ‘I had a good friendship of 16 years with Patricia and she had become very unhappy. ‘She was distressed as she wasn't able to read literature anymore - which was her passion. She had a good intellect and because of the Alzheimer's her sight was failing making it difficult to read. ‘She was the county archivist and a great mind. Patricia was also in a great deal of pain with the breast cancer.’ In an official obituary, Ms Bell's close . friend Richard Wildman, said: ‘Her greatest fear was that she would . emulate some of her cousins and live to an extreme and uncomfortable old . age.

These fascinating images show labourers harvesting forced rhubarb in vast, candlelit sheds at a farm that helped catapult the versatile plant back into popularity. Seasonal labourers at Oldroyd's Ashfield Home Farm in West Yorkshire's famous Rhubarb Triangle are busy carefully pulling up the early salmon-pink sticks, which are nurtured indoors from around November. The rhubarb is traditionally harvested by candlelight because strong light will stop the growth. In the pink: Labourers carefully pull up the stems at Oldroyd's Ashfield Home Farm in Yorkshire's Rhubarb Triangle . Season simulator: The tender early variety is kept in darkness because strong light will stop growth . The roots are only taken out of the soil and into the forcing shed after they have received the necessary amount of frost, specific to each variety. In the warmth and complete darkness, the plant has to use its own energy reserves, because it has no access to food or light. The stored carbohydrate in the roots is transformed into glucose, giving the forced rhubarb its distinctive, bittersweet flavour. The forced variety is more tender than that grown outdoors in the summer. Rhubarb is a native of Siberia and thrives in the wet cold winters in Yorkshire. West Yorkshire once produced 90 per cent of the world's winter forced rhubarb from the forcing sheds that were common across the fields there. Roots: The nine-square-mile Rhubarb Triangle in West Yorkshire was the world centre for production . Hero: Janet Oldroyd Hulme has become affectionately known by the media as the ‘High Priestess of Rhubarb’ The early winter frost converts the root energy store into a form accessible to the plant for growth when it is taken into the sheds. The 9-square-mile Rhubarb Triangle in West Yorkshire is famous for producing early forced rhubarb. In 1875, it became the first place in the world to build special sheds for growing rhubarb out of season. The Yorkshire coalfields provided a cheap local source of fuel to heat the sheds. As rhubarb’s popularity increased, so did the producers in this area, numbering well over 200 at rhubarb’s height in popularity. The quality of the Yorkshire crop became renowned, and demand for it became so huge that producers in other areas of Britain could not compete, and eventually stopped altogether. Got enough custard? There were more than 200 producers in the area at the height of rhubarb's popularity . Stemming the tide: Rhubarb fell out of popularity in wartime, when families on sugar rations found it too bitter . The producers were centralised in a frost pocket in the shadow of the Pennines between Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford, which became known as The Rhubarb Triangle. Geographically centrally positioned in Great Britain, coincidentally where railroads crossed, gave the producers a transport system to any corner of the country, so that the harvest could be in the market the next morning. Special 'Rhubarb Express' trains left the area nightly, mostly bound for the old Covent Garden market, and from there large amounts were sold on into Europe. But wartime Britain’s palate was rather on the sweet side thanks to rationing, and they simply could not get the sugar that they required to bring this sharp flavoured vegetable to their taste. Top of the crops: The rhubarb is examined for quality by the labourers . New leaf: The vegetable is back into popularity thanks to the efforts of farms and celebrity chefs . Tender is the night: Later varieties generally have a deeper colour than the earlier, salmon pink crop . After the war, as overseas trade began and quick easy refrigerated logistics made a wide range of new tropical fruits readily available, rhubarb was left on the shelf. Now, however, the humble plant is experiencing something of a revival, with celebrity chefs including Rick Stein, Nigella Lawson, Anthony Worrall Thompson and Jamie Oliver singing the praises of Yorkshire Forced Rhubarb. The Ashfield farm has received many awards for its vital role in bringing rhubarb back to the masses. Janet Oldroyd Hulme has become affectionately known by the media as the ‘High Priestess of Rhubarb’. The earliest recorded use of rhubarb is 2700BC, although its use is thought to date back much further. It was very important drug used for a variety of ailments particularly gut, lung and liver problems. Marco Polo is attributed with bringing the drug to Europe in the 13th Century, when it was referred to as the Rhacoma root. The drug was so sought-after that in 1657 in England, it could command three times the price of Opium. By the 16th Century, seeds had been introduced in Britain, but the wrong strain was imported and its use went into decline because the British version did not work. Rhubarb was first used in English cooking in the late 18th Century, probably in an attempt to get the benefits of the drug into the body, only gaining in favour with the British when the forcing process was accidentally discovered in Chelsea Physic Gardens in 1817.","Forced rhubarb traditionally harvested in dim conditions .

An alleged murderer tried to claim a reward from police after providing details on a drive-by shooting he was involved in, a court heard today. Isaac Dawson, 27, informed officers of the whereabouts of two weapons used in the murder of teenager Nana Darko-Frempong. The 18-year-old was gunned down outside his house in Tulse Hill, South London, for 'being in the wrong place at the wrong time'. Trial: Nana-Darko Frempong, 18, (pictured) who was gunned down outside his home in Tulse Hill, South London, in what prosecutors say was a motiveless act. Eight people are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of involvement in the murder . The Old Bailey heard how Dawson had told an ex-girlfriend that the teenager had been 'bodied' with a sawn-off shotgun and pistol. He is now standing trial with . eight others who allegedly took part in the motiveless killing. Dawson first phoned police four months after the murder, giving the names of Christopher Gabriel and Nathan Deacon as two of the killers - both of whom have also been charged with murder. Police recovered two weapons in a flat above a Best One convenience store on the High . Trees Estate in Tulse Hill, following Dawson's tip-off. The weapons in the flat, which was occupied by Sachia . Clarke, 22, were forensically matched to firearms residue at the scene of the . shooting. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the court that Dawson had sought a reward for . 'providing information in connection with a murder that he himself had . taken part in'. He added: 'That was why he had been able to . tell police all about the shooting of Nana Darko-Frempong, that was why . he was able to tell them all about where the guns might be found. Because he himself was involved.' The court heard how the victim was 'almost home' when the occupants of a grey Ford Focus opened fire on him. Two guns were then fired at the teenager from a distance of only a few feet, before the 'driver of the car then put his foot down and raced off'. Reward: Isaac Dawson, 27, informed officers of the whereabouts of two weapons used in the murder and the names of two of the alleged killers. The Old Bailey heard how he then asked police for a reward . Mr Darko-Frempong had been hit in the face and stomach and collapsed as his parents rushed down from their flat. They were moved away as paramedics . tried to save their son, assuming the fact he was not being rushed to . hospital meant he was not seriously hurt. But the parents then experienced what was described in court as 'every parent's worst nightmare', when their son was pronounced dead at the scene. The car was was later set ablaze in nearby Camberwell. Two weeks after Dawson had phoned police with information on the weapons' whereabouts, he once again called police. Mr Aylett said: 'He must have heard about what the police had found in the flat above the Best One shop.' 'He now rang to ask the police for a . reward. The police told him they could not give him a reward unless they . knew his name. He gave the name. It was Isaac Dawson.' Nine months later his girlfriend, and the mother of his son, told police how Dawson had confessed his involvement to her. 'The night after the murder Dawson had gone to visit her. He had been unable to sit still,' Mr Aylett said. He told her that a 'madness happened' and confessed he had 'bodied' someone. She was appalled and asked him 'how can you do something like that', to which he replied 'It wasn't just me, it was like three men shooting at him'. Mr Aylett said there was no known motive for the murder, telling jurors: 'There is nothing to indicate anyone had any reason to harm Nana Darko-Frempong.' 'Furthermore, although he was shot . outside his home address, there is no reason to believe he was expected . home at any specific time. 'Whoever was responsible for the . murder was able at short notice to call upon a number of willing . assistants to help with the destruction of the dark grey Ford Focus that . had been used by the gunmen. 'Nana it would seem, must have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.' Dawson, Tafari Deacon, also 27, . Christopher Gabriel, 25,  and . Nathan Deacon, 25, all deny murder . Romario Henry, 21, Christopher Broderick, 26, and Nathaniel Solomon, 23, deny . perverting the course of justice by setting the car alight. Al Daniels, 22,  and Sachia Clarke deny firearms offences. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Nana Darko-Frempong, 18, was shot outside his home in South London .

The man who through a bottle at Usain Bolt and the other competitors in the men's 100m Olympic final was spared jail today. Ashley Gill-Webb, who blamed his actions on bipolar disorder, was sentenced to an eight-week community order at Thames Magistrates' Court. Last month he was found guilty of public disorder at Stratford Magistrates' Court, near the Olympic Park where he disrupted the sprint final on August 5. Walking free: Ashley Gill-Webb leaves Thames Magistrates' Court today after being sentenced for throwing a plastic bottle on to the track during the men's 100m Olympic final . Gill-Webb, 34, from South Milford near Leeds, snuck in to the stadium using an old ticket. He hurled abuse at athletes including Mr Bolt, the eventual winner of the race, and threw a plastic beer bottle on to the track at the moment the highly anticipated event was beginning. The bottle landed behind the lane markers as the world's top sprinters exploded out of their blocks in the showpiece race. Gill-Webb will be electronically monitored and be subject to a 7pm to 7am curfew. He was also ordered to pay a £1,500 contribution to costs. District judge William Ashworth criticised the defendant for trying to ruin the experience for athletes and spectators, but added that his mental illness was partly to blame. Disruption: The bottle can be seen landing on the . track yards from Usain Bolt, far left, after being thrown by Gill-Webb, . circled top, at the moment the runners left the starting blocks . 'Your intention was to target the highest-profile event at the London Olympic and put off Usain Bolt,' he said today. 'The potential harm of triggering a false start was significant. By good fortune, you failed. You did, however, spoil the occasion for some spectators and tarnish the spirit of the Games. 'You suffer from bipolar disorder. At the time of the offence, you were in the throes of a manic episode. This made you over-confident and your behaviour risky. 'I have reduced your punishment to take account of the effects of your illness.' Gill-Webb was found guilty of intending to cause the runners harassment, alarm or distress by using threatening, abusive or disorderly behaviour, contrary to Section 4 of the Public Order Act. The judge said the man's behaviour was serious enough to require punishment, but said he thought he was unlikely to offend again. Offence: Gill-Webb threw the bottle, pictured at the bottom of this image, while shouting abuse at Mr Bolt . After the sentence was handed down, Gill-Webb breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at his wife as he left the dock. Prosecutor Helen Shaw argued in court that the high-profile nature of the incident warranted a harsher sentence. 'Some of the people who were in that area missed the event and had paid up to £4,000 a ticket,' she said, describing the race as a 'once-in-a-four-year event watched by millions of people around the world'. Tom Barley, defending, admitted that his client looked like 'a drunken yob' and said he had inflicted 'massive embarrassment' on his fellow countrymen who were hosting the Games. However, he noted that the father of two had not been drinking, and had already lost his job thanks to the publicity surrounding the case. The lawyer said that for a sufferer of mental illness, 'It must have been the worst day for it to happen, in the 100m final.' Champion: Despite the incident, Jamaica's Usain Bolt still went retain his Olympic crown in the 100m final . Gill-Webb is currently undergoing treatment for bipolar disorder. The court earlier heard that Gill-Webb had pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area and started shouting: 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an a*******,' before throwing the bottle. Dutch judo champion Edith Bosch confronted him about the incident, before police escorted him from the stadium and arrested him. After his arrest, he insisted he was the Scottish actor Alan Cumming, and later said he had no memory of the incident. Mr Bolt, the world record-holder and defending champion, won the 100m final in 9.63 seconds, ahead of Jamaican team-mate Yohan Blake, while the U.S.'s Justin Gatlin won bronze. The gold and silver medal-winners later said they had not noticed the disruption, but Mr Gatlin described it as 'a little distraction'.","Ashley Gill-Webb spared jail as he receives eight-week community order .

'Marrying him means everything to me. In a sense, he's like two people. He's one person at work, and then there's the man I see, somebody who's loving and kind.' Ashley said: 'I was in the Army when I met Amy, so she's used to me being away. 'When I think back to when I was shot, I can't believe that I'm still alive, but all I wanted to do was get back to Amy.' Amy's mother Shirley, 51, also recalled the moment when Ashley, unable to contact his family, rang her to say he was injured. Artifact: Stuart Eastwood holds the helmet worn in Afghanistan by Duke of Lancasters solider Ashley Irving when he was shot . She said: 'It was horrendous, he's such a likeable, easy-going lad.

Brave: Elsie Wilkes, who is known for dying her unusual colours, got her first tattoo just before Christmas . A great-grandmother had her first tattoo at the age of 78 - a butterfly inked on to her forearm. Elsie Wilkes, of Barrow, Cumbria, said her daughter dared her to have it done over lunch and she was in the tattoo parlour within hours. An artist etched the basic outline on her skin and it was gradually filled in during the weeks leading up to Christmas. Mrs Wilkes, who is known in the area for her penchant for dying her hair unusual . colours, conceded that the tattoo was a bid to retain her youth. 'It does make you feel younger,' she . said. 'I suppose one of the main reasons I got it is that we don’t have a . car anymore, we can’t go on holidays like we used to anymore, we can’t . dance like we used to, so what am I going to with myself?' She said she and her husband Harold, 89, . who served on the harrowing Arctic Convoys during the Second World War, . were slowing down and she needed new things to occupy her time. 'The real reason I went was that my middle daughter dared me to get it done,' added Mrs Wilkes. 'She dared me at dinner-time and by the afternoon I was in there.' Mrs Wilkes chose her image and a butterfly was drawn on her arm by an artist at All Style Tattoos in Barrow. 'I’m proud of it,' she added. 'You wouldn’t believe it, but I’m actually a very shy person. But I wasn’t going to get one where people couldn’t see it, was I?' Careful: An outline was drawn on to her skin and then filled in over several weeks, to avoid any adverse reaction . Surprise! Mrs Wilkes didn't tell her husband Harold, 89, what she was planning until it was done . The great-grandmother said she had always liked the idea of . getting a tattoo but it . simply wasn’t an option for women when she was growing up. 'When I was younger we didn’t have this sort of thing,' she said. 'I always say that if I was young now, I’d either be a goth or one those hippy people.' While Mrs Wilkes is happy to show off her new artwork now, she was not brave enough to tell her husband her plans until it was too late. 'She came home and it was done,' Mr Wilkes said.

The unusual fur markings, which make it appear as if he has eyebrows, have provoked much hilarity online from his many followers . The two black marks on his forehead give him a range of expressions that is wider than that of his feline friends, who usually reserve expressions of disdain for their owners.

The photos instantly became popular on the account named, 'samhaseyebrows,'  with his owner stating in the biography: 'Sam This is Sam. He has eyebrows.' The pictures of the cat quickly became an Internet sensation, spreading from Instagram to Twitter and Facebook. Even Sam looks surprised by his new found fame.

The U.S. Department of Energy suffered a major security breach after a large cyber-attack that targeted computer networks, it was revealed today. The Washington Free Beacon reported that an unknown group targeted the government organization two weeks ago and harvested the personal information of several hundred of its employees. While the agency says that no confidential data was compromised, experts said that attackers could have been targeting that data. Scroll down for letter to government employees . Breach: The Washington headquarters of the Energy Department faced a 'sophisticated' cyber-attack two weeks ago . Sinister intent? A source said that no classified information was compromised, though there is some evidence that the hackers could have been after it . The Free Beacon reports that officials from the Energy Department and the FBI are investigating the ‘sophisticated’ attack at the government agency’s Washington headquarters, and are looking into possible motives for the attack. A source told the paper that no classified information was compromised, though there is some evidence that the hackers could have been after it. Among other things, the department includes the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages nuclear power and weapons. Bill Gibbons, the Deputy Press Secretary for the Energy Department, told MailOnline that the organization is ‘letting the letter of the incident speak for itself,’ and added that he could comment no further on the matter. The letter, which may be read in full below, was sent out to DOE workers last Friday afternoon. In the note, the department reveals that the full extent of the cyber-hacking was unknown. The Free Beacon says that there is also indication that Chinese hackers could be to blame. Chinese hackers are believed to have been behind hackings of three top American newspapers. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post were hacked earlier this month. Security experts hired by the New York paper to deal with the security breaches found that the hackers routed the attacks through computers at U.S. universities, installed a strain of malicious software associated with Chinese hackers and initiated the attacks from university computers previously used to attack U.S. military contractors. Retaliation: The New York Times, pictured its office in Midtown Manhattan, claims the Chinese government is seeking to monitor their reporting on the Chinese Premier . The Chinese government had previously threatened to retaliate against the Times for the damaging report. The government blocked both the Chinese and English websites in the country after an article in October was published regarding Wen Jiabao's fortune. Searches for the publication's site as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members were also barred on the country's main microblog service with the Chinese government describing the feature as a 'smear.' A source told Krebs on Security that these hackers seem to have ‘the ability to do anything they wanted on the network.’ Former Energy Department security official Ed McCallum told the Free Beacon that the breach is a ‘continuing story of negligence.’ Meanwhile, the internal letter urges employees to take every security precaution, including encrypting all files and emails, as well as keeping personal emails and files off of government-issued computers. The Department of Energy (DOE) has just confirmed a recent cyber incident that occurred in mid-January which targeted the Headquarters’ network and resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of employee and contractor Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The Department is strongly committed to protecting the integrity of each employee’s PII and takes any cyber incident very seriously. The Department’s Cybersecurity Team, the Office of Health, Safety and Security and the Inspector General’s office are working with federal law enforcement to promptly gather detailed information on the nature and scope of the incident and assess the potential impacts to DOE staff and contractors. Based on the findings of this investigation, no classified data was compromised. We believe several hundred DOE employees’ and contractors’ PII may have been affected. As individual affected employees are identified, they will be notified and offered assistance on steps they can take to protect themselves from potential identity theft. Once the full nature and extent of this incident is known, the Department will implement a full remediation plan.  As more specific information is gathered regarding affected employees and contractors, the Department will make further notifications. The Department is also leading an aggressive effort to reduce the likelihood of these events occurring again. These efforts include leveraging the combined expertise and capabilities of the Department’s Joint Cybersecurity Coordination Center to address this incident, increasing monitoring across all of the Department’s networks and deploying specialized defense tools to protect sensitive assets. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and we all play an important role in maintaining the integrity and security of our networks. To help minimize impacts and reduce any potential risks, please keep the following best practices in mind: .","U.S. Department of Energy was hacked in 'sophisticated' attack two weeks ago, Washington-based paper reports .

Underfire: Daniel Harding was the subject of a withering attack after joining La Scala in January . A renowned British conductor is at the heart of a public spat between an Italian opera house and a verbose critic who has accused him of making Wagner sound 'homosexual'. Well-respected Daniel Harding, who is conducting at Milan's La Scala opera house, was subjected to a withering attack by opera reviewer Paolo Isotta after he arrived at the theatre in January. The fierce critic, who writes for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, launched his first scathing comments on the 37-year-old by describing his conducting of Verdi's Falstaff as 'heavy and pedantic'. An unrepentant Mr Isotta then described Mr Harding's interpretation of a piece from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde as 'so soft it made you think he wanted to back the unfounded theory that Wagner was homosexual.' But the criticism has proved too much for La Scala's manager Stéphane Lissner, the Daily Telegraph reported. He has struck Mr Isotta from the critic list, forcing him to purchase a ticket if he wants to hear performances. Mr Lissner said: 'Isotta has decided to wage a personal campaign.' The newspaper's editor Ferruccio de Bortoli defended the critic, according to The Daily Telegraph. Mr Harding has impressed the musical world with his talents, despite having never having any formal conductor training. You're barred: The critic has now been taken off the official list at La Scala, in Milan, after his repeated attacks . He was a member of the National Youth Orchestra at age 13 having studied the trumpet, but began a career in conducting at age 17, after he sent a tape of a performance her conducted to prominent conductor Sir Simon Rattle. He became Rattle's assistant at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1993-1994 and after his first year at university, he became an assistant with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, conducting them aged just 21. The critic did not enjoy Harding's 'soft' conducting of Wagner . He performed as a conductor at The Proms in 1996, making him the youngest-ever conductor to appear there. Harding is a regular visitor to the Dresden Staatskapelle, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouworkest, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Leipzig Gewandhausorchester and the Orchestra Filarmonica della Scala. In the U.S. and in Canada he has performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, Houston and Toronto Symphony Orchestras. He was recently honoured with the lifetime title of Conductor Laureate of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, where he previously held the positions of Music Director and Principal Conductor. He is Artistic Director of the Ohga Hall in Karuizawa, Japan. Mr Harding could not be reached for comment on the spat with Mr Isotta. Richard Wagner married a woman called Cosima, the daughter of the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt, who was 24 years his junior. She was his second wife and founded the Bayreuth Festival with him as a showcase for his stage works.","Daniel Harding was subject of withering attack by Italian newspaper critic .

Congress ignited outrage in Moscow on Thursday by voting to empower the U.S. to punish Russians implicated in human rights abuses. The Senate approved the measure, which has already passed the House of Representatives, in a sweeping 92-to-4 vote. As it was originally crafted, the legislation was meant to strengthen U.S. relations with Russia by finally lifting Cold War-era restrictions on trade relations. The restrictions were adopted in the 1970s as a means of punishing Communist countries. Without them, trade with Russia is expected to double. Scroll down for video . Livid: The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs led by Sergey Lavrov (pictured) described a measure passed by Congress on Thursday as 'nothing but a vindictive desire to counter Russia in world affairs' But Moscow is livid because the measure also includes a provision that would give U.S. officials the power to freeze the assets of Russians implicated in human rights abuses and to deny them visas. The provision is dubbed the 'Magnitsky Law' after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in Russian custody in 2009 after alleging that government officials had conspired in a $230 million tax fraud scheme. Twitter rage: 'It is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the US, where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century,' the Ministry wrote in a series of furious remarks on its official Twitter feed . The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the provision Thursday as 'nothing but a vindictive desire to counter Russia in world affairs.' 'It is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the US, where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century,' the Ministry wrote in a series of furious remarks on its official Twitter feed. 'Apparently, Washington has forgotten what year this is and still thinks the Cold War is going on.' The Ministry said the U.S. has no right to weigh in on the Russian government's internal affairs. 'The US decision to impose visa and financial sanctions on certain Russian citizens is like something out of the theatre of the absurd,' the Ministry wrote. 'Obviously, US passage of the ""Magnitsky Act"" will adversely affect the prospects of bilateral cooperation.' By contrast, Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said Congress has every right to keep Moscow in check when it comes to human rights. 'This culture of impunity in Russia has been growing worse and worse,' McCain said. 'There are still many people who look at the Magnitsky Act as anti-Russia. I disagree. I believe it is pro-Russia.' 'Ultimately passing this legislation will place the United States squarely on the side of the Russian people and the right side of Russian history, which appears to be approaching a crossroads.' The measure now goes to President Obama, who will likely sign it, even though he believes the trade bill should be considered separately from the human rights provision. Defense: Sen. John McCain hit back against critics of the measure, saying it would put the U.S. on 'the right side of Russian history'","Measure would empower U.S. to freeze assets of Russians implicated in human rights abuses .

Tony Barbara, 48, has been banned from keeping the animals for 10 years after an RSPCA investigation into dog fighting. Romford Magistrates' Court heard that Barbara had trained two pit bull terriers - called Elaine and Susie - and a bull terrier called Gerald for fighting. Police and RSPCA inspectors found the . stapler - a DIY method of treating wounds - and a 'flirt pole', a long stick with bait attached to improve dogs' chasing, jumping and biting, at his home in Dagenham, Essex. Scroll down for video . One of the fighting dogs seized by the RSPCA at the Dagenham home of Tony Barbara, who escaped jail for animal cruelty offences . Inspectors found a veterinary kit, which included a flesh stapler, above, with which Barbara treated his animals' injuries . Forensic tests showed the stapler had canine DNA on it. The court also heard there was clear evidence that Barbara, described as 'troubled' by police, had used the dogs for fighting - including notebooks recording detailed accounts of their fights. Barbara was convicted of a string of animal cruelty offences last year. He was handed a 24-week suspended prison sentence and banned from keeping dogs for ten years at Romford Magistrates' Court. He was convicted of possession of the flirt pole and a veterinary kit including the flesh stapler. Barbara, who is unemployed, had previously admitted possession of the two pit bull terrier type dogs, Susie and Elaine, in breach of the Dangerous Dogs Act. He was also found guilty of failing to get appropriate treatment for his pitbull Elaine, who had an injury to her teat and conjunctivitis. Despite the finding of the notebooks, Barbara was acquitted of five charges of causing animal fights to take place between 29 May and 6 September in 2011. The district judge said although there was clear evidence the fights took place, there was no way of proving whether they happened within the jurisdiction of England and Wales. Barbara was also found not guilty of four charges of causing unnecessary suffering, while two welfare offence charges were formally dismissed halfway through his trial, which took place last year. The fighting dogs were kept in the garden of unemployed Barbara's home, where RSCPA inspectors carried out a search as part of the special operations unit's investigation in the practice . The DIY veterinary kit was found alongside notebooks recording details of the dog fights and a 'flirt pole' used in their training . He was also ordered to pay costs of £780 at yesterday's sentencing. Speaking after the sentencing, Mike Butcher, of the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'Tony Barbara trained his dogs for the sole purpose of fighting - an activity which was a premeditated act intended ultimately to cause horrific levels of deliberate cruelty in the pit. 'He is clearly a troubled man, but it appears the one constant in his life was dog fighting. 'Despite this, there is no excuse for inflicting such suffering on those dogs we know about, and potentially many more that we don't. 'Dog fighting is a depressing blot on our reputation as a nation of animal lovers. 'While people like Barbara continue to pursue their sickening obsession, we will continue to track them down and bring them before the courts.'","Tony Barbara, 48, handed suspended sentence and banned from keeping the animals after RSPCA investigation into dog fighting .

Innocent: Khyra Ishaq, 7, was starved to death by her mother and stepfather - and now her surviving siblings are suing Birmingham City Council for breach of care . The five surviving siblings of Khyra Ishaq, who died after being starved to death by her mother and stepfather, are suing their local council for failing to protect them and save their sister's life. The brothers and sisters have filed a claim against Birmingham City Council because they were told of their and Khyra's plight four months before she died. All six children suffered horrific abuse at the hands of their mother Angela Gordon and her partner Junaid Abuhamza. Gordon and Abuhamza admitted . manslaughter of Khyra, who died aged seven after suffering starvation and abuse at . their home in May 2008. The pair also admitted five counts of child cruelty at Birmingham Crown Court in March 2010. Khyra weighed just 2st 9lb, had 60 external injuries and lay dying . with pneumonia and meningitis for two days while her mother was . downstairs eating a takeaway with her partner. Two of her siblings nearly died in hospital because of ‘re-feeding . syndrome’, a phenomenon first seen in the Nazi concentration camps where . the shock of eating food causes the body to shut down. Khyra and the other children were all starved as well as being subjected . to a harrowing punishment regime and a five-month detention, involving . beatings with a cane. If the children were caught taking any food the vile pair made them stand outside in the cold and forced them to over-eat until they threw up as part of a 'chilling' punishment regime. As a result of the appalling abuse . emaciated Khyra was reduced to scavenging bread from a neighbour’s bird . table and lost 40 per cent of her body weight. Lawyers acting for the five surviving children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have filed a ‘substantial’ claim against the city for allegedly breaching duty of care to them. Killers: Khyra's mother Angela Gordon (left) and stepfather Junaid Abuhamza admitted the manslaughter of the seven-year-old in 2010 and five counts of child abuse . Savage: Khyra Ishaq was whipped by Junaid Abuhamza with a bamboo cane whenever he thought that she had eaten too much . Hell: The family home in Handsworth, Birmingham, where Khyra was found starving to death by police in May 2008. The child was taken to hospital where she later died. The claim alleges that it’s ‘very likely’ that Khyra’s death would have been prevented if the council had taken all of the children into care when teachers first raised the alarm. Chilling: Khyra died weighing less that 3st and her remaining siblings believe she and they could have been saved from torment by the authorities . 'We allege that you owed a duty of care to our clients and were in breach of that duty of care as a result of the negligent failure of Birmingham City Council’s social services department to remove them from the family home,' the claim letter says. 'It is the case of all the living claimants and the case brought on behalf of the estate of Khyra Ishaq that your social services department ought reasonably to have removed all six children from the family home and placed them in local authority care on a date no later than January 9, 2008, which creates an alleged breach period of four months and eight days. 'It would appear that the children’s teachers had done everything in their power to assist the children. But the efforts of the teachers to engage the social services department were ignored. 'Had the single visit they requested your social services department make to the family home been undertaken in December 2007, and factoring in the reasonable period of approximately three weeks to obtain a care order thereafter, the children would have been removed into local authority care no later than January 9, 2008. It is very likely that the death of Khyra Ishaq would have been prevented.' The claim against the council relies on a liability report of a social work expert that was written in April 2012. Their mother withdrew all of her children from the breakfast club in January 2007 and she wrote to the schools in March 2007, asking staff to not give second helpings to the children. This well-equipped kitchen was as at the centre of the abuse, where children were starved or forced to over-eat . Well stocked: Despite there being plenty of food . to eat the children were starved in a campaign of abuse that cost Khyra . her life . In September 2007 she sent another letter to the schools which told staff to stop overfeeding the children and she added that they should not be given chocolate milk. The letter said: 'Please do not give my son too much food. He does not know his limits. He is skinny simply because it is hereditary, not because he is starved at home, so please stop excessive feeding.' Summing up at the end of a year-long case Justice Eleanor King said: 'Khyra was desperately ill, from when she had been beaten and made to stand for at least an hour in front of a cold fan. 'She died without medical treatment, without love, without comfort, or reassurance on a dirty mattress shared with her brothers and sisters in a room that she had scarcely left for five months.' Abuser: Mother Angela Gordon serving food to children at a family wedding in 2007 . Squalor: Khyra was forced to eat scraps on the floor of the family home's back yard or next door as she was desperate to eat . She said expert witnesses had testified that Khyra would have suffered a very painful and unpleasant death. The children’s biological father Ishaq Abuzaire is also pursuing proceedings on behalf of himself for the psychological injuries he has suffered since Khyra’s death and the abuse of the surviving children. Tony Hall, a partner at Birmingham-based Anthony Collins solicitors confirmed that Ishaq and the children were granted legal aid to pursue the substantial claims against the city. Accusations: The children's school tried to warn social services in Birmingham (pictured), but the family say they failed to act . Mr Hall said: 'We have sent a letter of claim on behalf of our clients. The council has until the end of January to respond by making admissions or denying the allegations. 'Any settlement that is approved for any of our clients will have to approved in court by a judge.' A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'We can confirm that we have received a letter of claim in this case. 'It would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.'","The seven-year-old died in 2008 weighing less than 3st and suffering from pneumonia and meningitis .

A Greek prosecutor today ordered an investigation into whether four suspected bank robbers were beaten in custody after police published mug shots that were altered to make their injuries appear less severe. Rights groups and critics have long accused Greek police of detaining immigrants and other prisoners in shocking conditions. Photos published in the Greek media of the men, who were aged between 20 and 25 and arrested on Friday, showed them bruised and bleeding while being escorted by police. But mug shots released by the police over the weekend had injuries missing. One had been altered to remove a purple bruise from beneath the suspect's left eye. Altered: A heavily-Photoshopped mug shot of suspected bank robber Nikolaos Romanos (left), 20, as distributed by the Greek police. The picture on the right shows the true severity of his facial wounds . In another, black bruises below the suspect's eyes and cheeks appear to have been erased. Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias acknowledged the photographs had been tampered with, but defended the decision by saying it was to make the four men recognisable to the public. 'Photoshop was used and I - just like you, just like any reasonable person - asked why was this done,' Dendias said on Greek television when asked about the press reports. 'Because if they hadn't been Photoshopped, in order to make them resemble an image that the average person would recognise them in, then the photos wouldn't have been published in the first place.' The mug shot of suspected bank robber Andreas Bourzoukos (left), 24,  and the photo published in the Greek media (right), showing him with far heavier bruises . He said police believed the injuries occurred when the suspects resisted arrest rather than when they were in custody. The leftist Syriza opposition criticised Dendias's comments and demanded an investigation into allegations by the families of the men that they had been beaten in police custody. Amnesty International backed calls for an impartial and thorough investigation, saying it was concerned by allegations of torture and ill-treatment by Greek police. 'The Greek authorities cannot just Photoshop their problems away. This culture of impunity needs to be stopped,' said Marek Marczynski, deputy director of Amnesty's Europe and Central Asia Programme. Greek news websites published a letter by the mother of one of the suspects accusing the police of mistreating her son because of his anti-establishment beliefs.

The four men were arrested during an attempted armed robbery at the branches of Greek lenders ATEbank and Hellenic Postbank in the northern town of Kozani on Friday. Two of the detainees appeared in court on Monday in a separate case, on charges of belonging to Conspiracy of Fire Cells, an urban guerrilla group which has claimed responsibility for a spate of bomb attacks since 2009. Greece has seen a surge in political violence in recent weeks, including makeshift bomb explosions outside the homes of journalists and political figures as well as shots fired at an office used by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.","Suspects' injuries seem slight in police mug shots .

Shocked: Nick Clegg, pictured here with Chris Huhne after Clegg won the 2007 Lib Dem leadership contest, was said to be 'genuinely shocked' by Huhne's downfall . Nick Clegg is facing the nightmare prospect of an unprecedented by-election loss to his Coalition partners after David Cameron ordered Tory high command to ‘go for the kill’ in the battle for Chris Huhne’s marginal seat. The Deputy Prime Minister was said to be ‘genuinely shocked’ by Huhne’s downfall. The former Energy Secretary had assured him ‘over and over again’ that there was nothing in the allegations against him. ‘Chris had said the same things to us as he had said in public,’ said a close ally of Mr Clegg. The Conservatives need a swing of just 3.5 per cent to seize Huhne’s Eastleigh stronghold in what would be the first time the Lib Dems have failed to hold a seat in a by-election in the party’s history. A poll must be held within three months, meaning it could take place on May 2, the same day as local elections in many parts of England. Sources said that far from ‘soft-pedalling’ to spare Lib Dem pain, the Tories had decided to go all out for victory – a foretaste of the 2015 election campaign, when they need to win 20 Lib Dem seats to achieve a Commons majority. It will be the first by-election in modern political history where two governing parties will be fighting fiercely against each other. The Prime Minister and a string of Tory Cabinet ministers are likely to visit the seat during the campaign. Maria Hutchings, the mother of an autistic son, who famously ‘handbagged’ Tony Blair over special needs schools closures in the 2005 election campaign, is expected to be confirmed as the Conservative candidate in Eastleigh. Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘When it comes to elections, we stand as separate parties. We will be fighting for every vote.’ One MP described Eastleigh as an opportunity to take revenge on the Lib Dems after they reneged on the Coalition deal to reform Commons boundaries, which are currently heavily biased against the Conservatives. Alec Shelbrooke said: ‘At least we get an early opportunity to exact revenge on the Lib Dems over boundaries.’ Lib Dem sources insisted that they were confident of holding the seat in a contest that will test Coalition relations to the limit. Campaign: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) has ordered his party to 'go for the kill' in the battle for the marginal seat. Maria Hutchings (right) is expected to be confirmed as the Conservative candidate in Eastleigh . Huhne had a majority of 3,864 in 2010, which the Conservatives face a tough battle to overturn despite the Lib Dems’ poor showing in national polls. The party controls the local council and has performed strongly in local elections. Lib Dem president Tim Farron insisted the party would throw ‘the kitchen sink’ at the impending by-election. ‘In Eastleigh all I can say is I think we take absolutely nothing for granted,’ he told Channel 4 News. ‘It’s clearly a Lib Dem-Tory marginal, …and we’ll be throwing the kitchen sink at it.’ Battle: Lib Dem president Tim Farron insisted the party would throw 'the kitchen sink' at the impending by-election . Lib Dem leader of Eastleigh council Keith House said: ‘We’re confident but never complacent. ‘We have a history of winning seats here even when the Lib Dems were polling at zero per cent nationally in the Eighties. We’ve been campaigning all year round so will keep doing so. The local party is bigger than any one person, though people are saddened that we have lost a hard-working MP.’ Announcing his intention to quit the Commons, Huhne said: ‘Having taken responsibility for something that happened ten years ago, the only proper course of action for me is to resign my Eastleigh seat in Parliament, which I will do shortly.’ The seat had been a Conservative stronghold until 1994, when the sitting MP Stephen Milligan was found dead in his flat . The South Coast seat was a Tory stronghold until 1994, when the sitting MP Stephen Milligan was found dead in his flat with an orange in his mouth. Lib Dem David Chidgey won the seat in a by-election, and it was held for the party in 2005 by Mr Huhne, who beat Tory Conor Burns by just 568 votes. In the last election, Huhne increased his majority. A senior Lib Dem said: ‘The by-election will be interesting to say the least. We are incredibly strong on the council, but before 1994 it was a Tory seat. It’s not one with a longstanding Liberal tradition.’ Mr Clegg’s former chief spin doctor Olly Grender wrote on Twitter there was ‘no question’ it was a ‘horrific day to be a Lib Dem’ and issued an unreserved apology for defending Huhne.","Cameron has told Conservatives to 'go for the kill' in by-election .

New parents will be allowed to work alternate months for up to a year under moves to tear up ‘old-fashioned and rigid’ workplace rules. Mums and dads will be able to ‘mix and match’ how they look after a newborn baby for their first year. They will be able to take up a total of 52 weeks in joint leave, either taking it in turns or at the same time. Ministers hope the changes, published today, will encourage fathers to play a bigger role in raising their child while mothers are able to return to work at a time of their choosing. Minsters want parents to be able to share up to 52 weeks of parental leave in the first year after their child is born . The Children and Families Bill is aimed at modernising workplace rules, with dads taking more time off to raise children and mums returning to work sooner. But it risks creating an organisational nightmare for employers, who will not be able to refuse requests to take off but can turn block the pattern of leave, if parents want to take time off in different chunks. Business Minister Jo Swinson said: ‘Current workplace arrangements are old-fashioned and rigid. The Children and Families Bill will bring the way mums and dads balance their lives at work and at home into the 21st century. ‘Employers will soon get used to more . men taking time off after their child is born and more mothers returning . to work earlier, shattering the perception that it is mainly a woman’s . role to stay at home and look after the child. ‘These . measures will really help our aim of ensuring more businesses are . making best use of women’s talents throughout the organisation, from the . boardroom to the shop floor.’ The . government claims the family-friendly changes to shared parental leave . and flexible working will support economic growth and increase . productivity. Statutory maternity pay will be replaced by parental leave pay. Business minister Jo Swinson said the changes would make it easier for families in the 21st century . The parent taking the first six weeks of leave will receive 90 per cent of average earnings. For the next 33 weeks they will be paid £135.45-a-week. The remaining 13 weeks of leave would be unpaid. However business groups have warned against the idea. When the policy was floated last year the British Chamber of Commerce warned it could not 'support proposals encouraging parents to request patterns of shared leave alternating between them in chunks as small as a week'. Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy, said: 'Few employers will be able to find adequate cover over an extended but non-continuous period. 'We believe that such requests will almost always be rejected as unworkable, causing unnecessary stress to the relationship between employer and employee.' On childcare, there are proposals to . introduce childminder agencies to help more childminders into the market . and offer greater support and assurance of quality. Workers will also be allowed to attend two ante-natal appointments with a pregnant woman, if they are the child's father, same-sex parent of married to the mother-to-be. Leave and pay entitlements for adopters will also be brought more closely into line with what is  available to birth parents. The Bill also aims to speed up the adoption process. Children wait an average of almost two years between entering care and moving in with an adoptive family. The Bill seeks to improve support for the families, and ensure that a search for a perfect or partial ethnic match does not become a barrier to finding a child a parent. Anne Marie Carrie, the chief executive of charity Barnardo's, said: 'In . these difficult times protecting and promoting the well-being of the . most vulnerable children in society must be our absolute priority, now . more than ever. 'In reforming the system our utmost concern must always be the child and . we will always fight for their voice to be heard and their needs put . first as any changes are made.' On family justice, the Bill seeks to introduce a time limit of 26 weeks when courts are considering whether a child should be taken into care, ensuring they do not get caught up in unnecessary evidence or bureaucratic delay. It will also bring in new 'child arrangement orders' designed to focus parents on the child's needs rather than their own 'rights' and make sure more families have the opportunity to try mediation before applying to court. Education minister Edward Timpson said the legislation would speed up the adoption system . The Bill aims to extend the special educational needs system from birth to 25, giving children, young people and their parents greater choice in decisions and ensuring needs are properly met. It will replace statements and learning difficulty assessments with a new birth-to-25 Education, Health and Care Plan, extending rights and protections to young people in further education and training and offering families personal budgets so they have more control over the support they need. It also seeks to improve co-operation between all the services that support children and their families and require local authorities and health authorities to work together. Children and families minister Edward Timpson, who is to make a speech on the issue later, said: 'In this Bill we will overhaul adoption - breaking down barriers for adopters and provide more support to children. 'We will reform family justice - tackling appalling delays and focusing on the needs of the child. And we will improve services for vulnerable young people - transforming the Special Educational Needs system and better protecting children's rights.' However Richard Hawkes, chief executive of charity Scope, said: 'The Government said its SEN reform would prevent parents being forced to go from 'pillar to post' in a battle between different authorities and agencies. 'Parents of disabled children have been looking forward to action. But instead it looks like the Government is going to politely suggest to local bodies that they do their best to improve things. 'Parents say it's a battle to get their children support such as childcare or nursery places, appropriate schools, essential therapies or even healthcare in their local area. 'But buzz words such as 'culture change' and 'local frameworks' will do nothing to alleviate the stress and anxiety parents feel.'","Children and Families Bill promises shake-up of adoption, parental leave and special needs help .

A nine-month old baby is fighting for his life after being so severely malnourished he weighed the same as a newborn. Varius Bledsoe's mother Walteria, from Houston, Texas, appeared in court yesterday accused of injury to a child by omission after her son weighed just 7lbs 9 when he was brought to hospital. The baby should have weighed 17lb, according to the Child Protective Service (CPS) and was so malnourished he suffered renal, liver and heart failure. Walteria Bledsoe, from Houston, is accused of causing injury to a child after her nine-month-old baby Varius was brought to hospital weighing just 7lb 9 . He also needed two abdominal operations at the Memorial Hermann Hospital in November and is still being fed through a tube. When Varius was taken to hospital by his mother his ribs were visible and his stomach was sunken. Bledsoe, 23, appeared at court yesterday in front of District Judge Marc Carter accused of not feeding her son properly. Chron.com quoted assistant Harris County District Attorney Alison Baimbridge as telling the court: 'The child, at nine months old, weighs what a newborn would weigh. 'It appears to be fairly severe. The child was severely malnourished.' His mother said the baby was born premature at 28 weeks and weighed just 5lb when he released at ten weeks old. Varius was about 10lb underweight when he arrived at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston and had to have two abdominal operations . Bledsoe said Varius could not keep formula down and a family member suggested she try to feed him evaporated milk instead. Child Protective Services have since removed the baby and his two siblings from Bledsoe and placed them in foster care. The arrest warrant stated Bledsoe did know he was small but not so much that he should be considered malnourished. She said her other children and their father were also small. After the hearing, the defendant's sister Tasha Bledsoe told Chron.com: 'He's not bad, like they say. 'My sister is a good mother.' Bledsoe was released on a $20,000 bond but faces life in prison if convicted of the first-degree felony.","Varius Bledsoe was so thin his ribs were visible and his stomach sunken in .

A promising 13-year-old footballer is fighting for his life in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest during a game. Quinton Barham collapsed on the pitch just minutes after complaining of feeling unwell at an under-14s cup match in Bromham, Wiltshire, on Sunday. First aiders and an off-duty paramedic gave the teenager CPR before an air ambulance arrived at the Bromham Social Centre and medics re-started his heart. Talented player: Quinton Barham, 13, collapsed on the pitch after scoring his third goal in an under-14s cup . Aid: Medics gave the teenager CPR before an air ambulance arrived at Bromham Social Centre . He was stabilised before being taken to Bristol Children's Hospital, but doctors still do not know if he will ever play football again. Speaking from his bedside, father Paul, 48, said: 'He is still critical and still asleep, doctors have kept him that way for now. 'He is still on a life-support machine and he is undergoing tests to try and find out what is wrong with him. 'We have been told that his pulmonary artery is in the wrong place, it is in the middle of his two heart chambers rather than going through it. 'Because he was playing football and his heart was working hard to pump the blood, it basically crushed the artery which caused the heart attack.' It is believed the football-mad teenager had just scored his third goal when he suddenly felt unwell and complained to his father of pains in his chest. Terrifying: Doctors said they will not know how much damage has been done to his brain for some time . Within minutes Quinton, from Trowbridge, Wilts., had collapsed on the side of the pitch and medics performed CPR on the youngster. It is thought that he was 'unstable' for around an hour before doctors managed to regulate his heartbeat. Mr Barham today described the moment he thought his son had died in his arms, saying: 'It was a quarter-final cup match and he had played the first half and scored a hat-trick - he is a top goal scorer. 'About five minutes into the second half Quinton put his hand up and came running off the pitch clutching his chest. 'I was stood on the other side of the field and I saw them sit him down and wrap coats around him to keep him warm. 'I could see something wasn't right with him so I went round to see him. 'He was sat in the crouched position and I put my arm around him and he told me that his chest really hurt. 'Within seconds of saying that, his head fell back, his eyes rolled back, he fell into my arms, and he stopped breathing. 'I have never seen somebody look like that in my life, he was so white. 'Then all of a sudden somebody, I think another parent, was performing CPR and then somebody else came along and carried on and that was ultimately what saved him. 'If I hadn't have gone across to see him, nobody would have noticed him, he would have rolled backwards, people would have thought he was taking a nap or something and he would have died. It was so close. 'I'm so glad I went around to see him, it keeps going over and over in my head.' The father said Quinton is now showing signs of improvement after doctors reduced his muscle relaxant and he had begun to flex his fingers and even cough. 'They obviously had to put him straight back under again but they just wanted to see how he was doing', he said. 'Things are starting to look up now, there are a few signs that are giving us hope.' Frightened: Quinton's family, including brother Lathaniel (pictured left with his sibling) gathered at his bedside . Doctors now think the schoolboy will have to have an operation to put his artery back in place. Quinton's cousin Carly Barham, 21, tweeted a message of support for her relative, which was yesterday picked up and retweeted by Fabrice Muamba, who himself collapsed on a football pitch. Ms Barham described her cousin, who is the youngest of four, as a 'football-mad Man United fanatic' who would do anything for anyone. Miss Barham, from Melksham, Wilts., said: 'The whole thing has come as a big shock because he is so young, no one would ever have thought it would happen to him. 'He is just the most genuine kid you will ever meet and if he can't play football again he will be absolutely devastated. 'His whole life is football, if he's not out with his mates playing football then he's in his room playing Fifa, it's all he talks about and all he ever wanted to do. 'He is the biggest Man United fan you will ever meet as well, he absolutely adores them. 'He's just a really cheeky chappy, totally harmless and very lovable. 'Football kept him going, but it also could have been the death of him, it's so awful.' Talented player Quinton's dream is to sign for a premier league team in the future. But doctors cannot be sure how much damage the heart attack has caused to his brain and said it would be impossible to tell until much later on. Quinton's distraught father, mother Debbie, sisters Toni-Anne and Claire and brother Lathaniel were awaiting the results of a heart scan at his bedside yesterday. Nick Maw, Chairman of Bradford Town Youth Football Club, Quinton's team, said: 'The club's thoughts and prayers are with the boy and his family at this time. 'We are waiting to hear news on the boy's progress but the emergency services were on the scene within minutes and did a fantastic job.'","Doctors believe the 13-year-old's pulmonary artery is in the wrong place .

The U.S. government is expected to file civil charges against Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, alleging that it improperly gave high ratings to mortgage debt that later plunged in value and helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis. The charges would mark the first enforcement action the government has taken against a major rating agency involving the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. S&P said Monday that the Justice Department had informed the rating agency that it intends to file a civil lawsuit focusing on S&P's ratings of mortgage debt in 2007. Scroll down for video . Charges: The U.S. government is expected to file civil charges against Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, alleging that it improperly gave high ratings to mortgage debt that later plunged in value and helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis . S&P denies any wrongdoing and says any lawsuit would be without merit. The action does not involve any criminal allegations. Critics have long complained about the government's failure to bring criminal charges against any major Wall Street players involved in the financial crisis. Criminal charges would require a higher burden of proof and carry the threat of jail time. If S&P is eventually found to have committed civil violations, it could face fines and limits on how it does business. A federal lawsuit would ""disregard"" the fact that S&P reviewed the same data on risky mortgages as U.S. government officials, who said publicly in 2007 that the problems in the subprime mortgage market appeared to be limited, the company said in a statement. Waiting game: The securities collapsed once the housing bubble burst and home-loan delinquencies soared. Major U.S. banks absorbed tens of billions in losses . In the statement, S&P said it ""deeply regrets"" that its ratings on some securities ""failed to fully anticipate the rapidly deteriorating conditions in the U.S. mortgage market during that tumultuous time."" Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre declined to comment on the matter. According to a report in the New York Times, the lawsuit will likely be brought this week after settlement talks between the Justice Department and S& P broke down last week. The talks collapsed over federal authorities' insistence that a settlement involve at least $1 billion, the Times reported. Judges have previously thrown out claims brought by investors against the rating agencies, on the grounds that their ratings amount to free speech protected by the First Amendment. But that argument hasn't always succeeded in cases involving investments like those in the expected S&P suit, according to research by the Brattle Group, a consulting firm. That's because those ratings weren't published widely, as most bond ratings are. As a result, several courts have ruled that those ratings do not enjoy free-speech protection. S&P is a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos. McGraw-Hill's stock plunged nearly 14 percent Monday after reports surfaced about the government's expected lawsuit.

The two companies' stocks suffered the biggest percentage drops in the S&P 500 index, which finished down slightly more than 1 percent. S&P, Moody's, and Fitch Ratings, the third major rating agency, have been blamed for helping fuel the financial crisis by assigning AAA ratings to trillions of dollars in risky securities backed by subprime mortgages. The securities collapsed once the housing bubble burst and home-loan delinquencies soared. Major U.S. banks absorbed tens of billions in losses. The rating agencies are important arbiters of the creditworthiness of securities traded around the world. The grades they assign can affect a company's ability to raise or borrow money and how much investors will pay for securities it issues. The securities in the anticipated federal lawsuit are collateralized debt offerings. CDOs are investment vehicles that contain many underlying mortgage loans. A CDO generally gains in value if borrowers repay. But a wave of defaults can cause them to tumble in value. Soured CDOs contributed to, and intensified, the financial crisis. Critics have long argued that rating agencies have an inherent conflict of interest: They're paid by the same companies whose products and credit they rate. The agencies have been accused of issuing unduly high ratings before the crisis, in part because of pressure from banks they desired as clients.","Charges would mark the first .

Finding time to schedule in exercise around our busy working lives can sometimes seem impossible. But what if your workout came to you? That’s the idea behind a new, pop-up hot yoga studio that travels around offices offering quick classes during workers’ lunchbreaks. Devotees claim hot yoga — the exercise is performed at a high temperature — can calm the mind, help stretching and ease physical woes. Hotpod: Resembling giant inverted bouncy castles, the hotpods are heated up to 38C . Its celebrity fans include Andy Murray and Lady Gaga. Heating the studio to the required temperature often means going to a specialist gym but these new portable ‘hotpods’ aim to change that. Resembling giant inverted bouncy castles, they are plugged into the mains, then inflated and heated to 38C. An instructor uses the space — specially designed with curved walls and muted colours to be relaxing — to guide a class of up to 20 people through an intense hour of yoga. Famous fans: Andy Murray and Lady Gaga swear by the hot yoga practise . Once the lesson is over, the studio is deflated and folded away. Hotpod yoga was launched in three London locations last month, and is now expanding nationwide. Great workout: Yoga can burn up to 700 calories in an hour . ‘We wanted to focus on people who are busy and have little time to exercise,’ explains former strategy consultant Max Henderson, who set up the company with a childhood friend, yoga teacher Nick Higgins. ‘Hotpod Yoga is perfect for corporate businesses because yoga is great for de-stressing as well as being a strenuous workout, burning up to 700 calories in an hour. ‘We thought doing it inside offices meant people wouldn’t have to go anywhere to exercise. Interest has been phenomenal.’ He says all a company needs for the hotpod to be set up is some empty space and showers for participants to use afterwards. ‘I think it is a great concept,’ says Gemma Hamilton, who went to a session in London. ‘The yoga itself was like a Bikram-aerobics hybrid, and the pod was excellent — the mats were clean and they had dotted lovely candles around it.’ Beats a sandwich at the desk any day.

Far from being lonely at the top, people with power are happier than those without it, researchers have found. Wielding power brings contentment and leads people to believe that they can be true to themselves. Researchers conducted experiments to find out if holding a position of authority enhanced well-being through an increased feeling of authenticity. Lonely at the top? Researchers found powerful employees were 26 per cent more satisfied in their job than their powerless colleagues and power can actually make people happier . Yona Kifer, of Tel Aviv University in . Israel, and colleagues predicted that because the powerful can ‘navigate . their lives in congruence with their internal desires and . inclinations’, they feel as if they are acting more authentically – more . like ‘themselves’ – and are therefore more content. Their findings – published in . Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological . Science – revealed that  those who felt powerful at work, among friends, . or in romantic relationships were 16 per cent more satisfied with their . lives than the least powerful among the 350 participants who took part . in the survey. The effect was most pronounced in the . workplace, with powerful employees 26 per cent more satisfied with their . jobs than powerless colleagues. According to the research Bill Gates, left, and Barack Obama, right, who were named in Forbes list of World's Most Powerful People top four, will be happier because they can make decisions based on their own beliefs . The happiness discrepancy was less . pronounced for friendships and relationships because, said the . researchers, friendships are associated with a sense of community rather . than hierarchy, and having power in such situations is less important. In other experiments, the team . examined the relationship between power, feelings of authenticity, and . general well-being, by manipulating each factor independently. The results revealed that being in a . position of power leads  people to feel more authentic  and ‘true to . themselves’ by allowing their actions to more closely reflect their . beliefs and desires. Feelings of authenticity, in turn, enhanced . feelings of well-being and happiness. The findings suggested that even the . perception of having power could lead people to live more authentic . lives, thereby increasing their happiness and well-being. ‘By leading people to be true  to . their desires and inclinations  – to be authentic – power leads . individuals to experience greater happiness,’ the researchers conclude. The team proposed that future research into power dynamics, happiness . and authenticity should focus on specific kinds of power, both positive – . such as charisma – and negative – such as punishment.","Powerful people can make more decisions based on their own beliefs .

Argentina has refused to attend talks over the future of the Falklands because British Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted islanders be present. Hector Timerman, Argentina's foreign minister, sparked a diplomatic spat by rejecting the offer by the UK government to hold a meeting aimed at diffusing growing tensions over the sovereignty of the islands. Islanders had planned a 'frank exchange of views' before the Argentine pulled out of the face-to-face showdown. The Argentine foreign minister Hector Timerman refused to attend a meeting on the Falklands (pictured) if islanders were present . The United Nations regards the dispute over the islands which Argentina knows as the Malvinas as a bilateral issue between Buenos Aires and London, he said. And he said he was sorry that Mr Hague ‘can't meet without the supervision of the colonists from the Malvinas’. Mr Timerman invited Mr Hague to meet with him in Buenos Aires, where he said ‘my fellow foreign ministers can freely meet with whomever they wish without being pressured or having their presence conditioned on meetings that they haven't asked for and don't interest them’. Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has in recent years strongly asserted her country's demands for the Falklands to come under its sovereignty despite the opposition of the islanders. Earlier this month, she had an advert published in British newspapers claiming that Argentina had been stripped of the islands in ‘a blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism’. Prime Minister David Cameron has repeatedly insisted the residents of the Falklands must decide their own future and a referendum on the islands' political status is to be held in March. A referendum on the islands' political status is to be held in March . Mr Timerman said he was sorry he could not meet with Foreign Secretary William Hague without the supervision of the colonists from the Malvinas’ In a statement released before Mr Timerman turned down the meeting, the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands stressed that their representatives, Dick Sawle and Jan Cheek, would not be ‘negotiating any deal’. ‘Rather we are anticipating a full and frank exchange of views,’ the assembly said. ‘Indeed we look forward to giving Mr Timerman some very direct messages on the unacceptability of Argentina's actions against the Falkland Islands in recent years. Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner recently published an advert in several national newspapers claiming the Falklands were 'forcibly stripped' from Argentina 180 years ago . ‘We demand that our rights be respected, and that we be left in peace to choose our own future and to develop our country for our children and generations to come. ‘It is only right that he should hear this directly from us, as well as from Mr Hague.’ In its statement, the Falklands assembly cited Britain's opposition to ‘any negotiations over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until the Falkland Islanders so wish’. ‘The Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly believes that the result of the forthcoming referendum will demonstrate definitively that we do not. Should the issue of sovereignty be raised at the meeting, it will not be discussed,’ it said. ‘Members of the Legislative Assembly made it clear in their letter of 2012 to President Fernandez de Kirchner... that the Falkland Islands Government is willing to meet with the Government of Argentina in order to make our views clear, and to discuss matters of mutual interest including fisheries and communication.’ A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ‘We are aware that Argentine foreign minister Hector Timerman is due in the UK next week, and have invited him to come to the Foreign Office to meet the Foreign Secretary and representatives of the UK Government and the Falkland Islands Government.’","Argentine foreign minister Hector Timerman refuses to attend meeting with William Hague because Falklanders would be there .

He wore a pressurized suit and jumped 24 miles up from a capsule . hoisted by a giant helium balloon over New Mexico. Scroll down for video. Austrian Felix Baumgartner, 24 miles above Earth, jumps out of his capsule and starts his descent through the heavens. He fastest speed was 844 mph, 10 mph quicker than first thought . Baumgartner was supersonic for a half-minute - 'quite . remarkable,' according to Brian Utley, the official record-keeping official who . was present for the October 14 feat. His heart rate remained below 185 beats a . minute, and his breathing was fairly steady. The leap was from an altitude of 127,852 feet. That's 248 feet . lower than original estimates. 'He jumped from a little bit lower, but he actually went a . little bit faster, which was pretty exciting,' said Art Thompson, technical . project director for the Red Bull-sponsored project. 'It's fun for us to see reaching Mach speeds and proving out a . lot of the safety systems,' Thompson said in a phone interview from his . aerospace company in Lancaster, Calif. Thompson said everything pretty much unfolded as anticipated, . with no surprises in the final report. The updated records were provided by . Utley, official observer for the National Aeronautic Association's contest and . records board. Utley was in Roswell, N.M., for Baumgartner's grand finale . jump. In the foreword of the 71-page report, Baumgartner said he . never imagined how many people would share in his dream to make a supersonic . free fall from so high. Some 52 million people watched You Tube's live stream of the . exploit. 'Fearless Felix' Baumgartner celebrates his successful landing. His death-defying jump yielded a wealth of information about the punishing effects of extreme speed and altitude on the human body . The scientific and engineering experts who helped bring him . back alive 'broke boundaries in their own fields just as surely as I broke the . sound barrier,' Baumgartner wrote. Baumgartner shattered the previous record for a free fall . plunge, made by Joe Kittinger, an Air Force officer, in 1960. Kittinger did not . quite reach supersonic speed during his jump from 19.5 miles up. With Baumgartner safely landed, researchers were exhilarated over the . possibility his exploits could someday help save the lives of space . travelers in a disaster. Baumgartner's death-defying jump yielded a wealth of . information about the punishing effects of extreme speed and altitude on . the human body - insights that could inform the development of improved . spacesuits, new training procedures and emergency medical treatment. A . NASA engineer who specializes in astronaut escape systems said . Baumgartner's mission 'gives us a good foundation' for improving the . odds of survival for professional astronauts, space tourists and . high-altitude pilots and passengers. Dr Jonathan Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon who lost his wife in the space shuttle Columbia accident believes the data from Baumgartner's jump can be used to improve astronaut safety . 'What I would hope is that, perhaps, . this is just the first step of many, many advancements to come' in . emergency bailouts, said Dustin Gohmert, who heads NASA's crew survival . engineering office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. In an interview after Baumgartner . became the first skydiver to break the speed of sound, Gohmert noted . that researchers have spent decades working on self-contained space . escape systems, with few significant advances. Baumgartner's feat was sponsored by . energy drink maker Red Bull, and NASA had no role. Dr Jonathan Clark places a rose on his mother's casket with his son Iain. Laurel Clark died in the space shuttle Columbia accident . But Dr Jonathan . Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon who lost his wife, Laurel, in the . space shuttle Columbia accident and dedicated himself to improving crew . escape systems, was in charge of Baumgartner's medical team. And he was thrilled at how much was learned. Clark said his team is still . analyzing all the medical data - heart rate, blood pressure and the like . - collected from sensors on Baumgartner's body. Baumgartner's technique for righting . himself may prove useful for companies like Virgin Galactic that are . developing spacecraft that will take tourists up into space and right . back down. These enterprises will need to have some sort of emergency . escape plan. As for the now-ended shuttle program, Columbia was traveling too high and too fast during its 2003 descent for a Baumgartner-style exit to have helped the seven astronauts. The spaceship broke apart about 40 miles up while traveling more than Mach 17, unleashing forces that tore the crew members' bodies apart. In the 1986 Challenger disaster, the crew capsule shot out of the fireball that erupted during liftoff, but there are too many unknowns to say whether any lessons from Baumgartner's feat might have applied to that tragedy, Gohmert said. Baumgartner's pressurized suit - a close cousin of the orange suits used by shuttle astronauts and the suits worn by high-altitude U-2 spy pilots - was designed for use in a standing, free-falling position, while conventional spacesuits are made primarily for sitting. By all accounts, the new suit performed well. 'I think all of us here in our lab specifically who have dealt with the shuttle suits have looked at this in wonder and amazement, and really appreciated what they did,' Gohmert said. 'And that efficiency that they brought it forth with is also a model for us to learn from as well.'","Felix Baumgartner, the parachutist who jumped to Earth from the edge of space, hurtled towards Earth at 10 mph quicker than original calculations .

A fantasist may have started the fire that killed his partner’s two-year-old daughter because he wanted to act the hero, an inquest heard yesterday. Terry Webb, a lorry driver who posed as a battle-hardened Army veteran, sprinted to the scene when flames from a barn fire engulfed a van in which Isobel Dobson and her one-year-old sister Sarah were sitting. He unfastened the belt on Sarah’s baby seat and pulled her through a window to safety. But when he tried to reach Isobel, the heat was too intense and the vehicle exploded with her trapped inside. Tragedy: Two-year-old Isobel Dobson died after a fire started in a Transit van parked at her mother's farm near Pontefract, West Yorkshire . The tragedy occurred in September . 2011 as Mr Webb, 39, helped the girls’ mother Stacey Catch tend a . friend’s horse at a farm near Pontefract, West Yorkshire. A police investigation produced a shocking theory, said coroner David Hinchliff. ‘There is a belief Mr Webb perhaps . didn’t want to harm the children but may have deliberately started the . fire to rescue them and therefore in everybody’s eyes be a hero.’ Accusation: Stacey Catch told an inquest into her daughter's death that she believed her boyfriend Terry Webb may have started the blaze deliberately . Mr Webb had returned to the Transit . van to check on the children shortly before the vehicle and a barn . packed with hay went up in flames. He was the only one nearby and . experts believe the blaze was started by a naked flame being held next . to hay, the inquest in Wakefield heard. The plan ‘went drastically wrong’ as . he ‘wouldn’t have appreciated’ how quickly and fiercely the fire would . take hold, Mr Hinchliff said. He asked Miss Catch, 24, whether she believed this explanation. She replied ‘I do believe that’s a possibility.’ Miss Catch told of her bizarre relationship with fantasist Mr Webb, from whom she has since split. She had been married to Isobel’s father Andrew Dobson, who was in the Royal Engineers, but they separated. She met Mr Webb, a married father of two living in the Isle of Wight, through an internet dating site. He moved to West Yorkshire to live with Miss Catch in January 2010 after they had met only once. Miss Catch soon discovered she was . pregnant with Sarah, but Mr Webb was not the father. However, the couple . told everyone he was. Blaze: Firefighters were unable to save the two-year-old before she was killed by the fire . Terror: But Miss Catch admitted her own partner Terry Webb could have been responsible for the fire . Mr Webb insisted the baby, born in . July 2010, was named after his sister who he said had been murdered. This was ‘nonsense’, the inquest heard. Mr Webb claimed he had served for 16 years in the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan, Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia. He wanted to be a ‘brave soldier . rather than a boring ordinary man from the Isle of Wight who drives . lorries’, Mr Hinchliff said. Aftermath: Police investigated the burnt-out van where Izzy and her sister Sarah had been at the time . Investigation: An inquest is now under way into the circumstances of Izzy's tragic death . Miss Catch said Mr Webb eventually . confessed his Army career was a fantasy but kept up the pretence to her . family and even to paramedics and a police officer after the fire. After they and the baby were taken to . hospital for treatment, she asked Mr Webb: ‘Did you have anything to do . with it?’ She said he replied: ‘No’. Mr Webb was arrested on suspicion of . murder and attempted murder. A file was sent to the Crown Prosecution . service but he has not been charged. The inquest continues.
