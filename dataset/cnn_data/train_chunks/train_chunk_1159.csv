"From the glamour of the roaring '20s to the short skirts and Teddy Boys of the swinging '60s, Cecil Beaton captured it all. Now a new exhibition at Wilton House in Wiltshire is to unveil previously unseen images from his -  and Sotheby's - archives. Described . as ‘a worldly Peter Pan who never aged’, Beaton regularly worked for Vogue and Vanity Fair and made his name documenting the antics of the aristocracy, royals and Hollywood stars. Clowning about: Stephen Tennant, William Walton, Georgia Sitwell, Zita Jungman,Rex Whistler and Cecil Beaton . Writer: Edith Maud Olivier MBE, was photographed by Beaton dressed as Queen Elizabeth I in 1932 . But although his subjects included some of the brightest stars of the era, photographing London's youthful bohemian set, known at the time as Bright Young Things, became his passion. Among them were members of the aristocratic Pembroke family, the owners of Wilton Hall and the stars of the new exhibition. Curated by designer Jasper Conran, the works are a vivid portrait of country house parties and costume balls, and there's even a rare glimpse of the entertainment laid on for the troops billeted at Wilton during World War II. One particularly charming image shows Maud Olivier dressed, rather incongruously, as a severe Elizabeth I, complete with layers of white panstick make-up. Ms Olivier, a long-standing friend of Beaton and the Pembrokes, was a brilliant writer and society hostess, and was given an MBE for helping create the Wiltshire Women's Land Army during the First World War. Fun: The Countess of Pembroke dressed for her role 'Heil Cinderella' - a pantomime written by Beaton . Portrait of a photographer: Cecil Beaton on the Palladian Bridge at Wilton House, September 1968. Friends: The Earl and Countess of Pembroke dressed for the coronation of George VI, 1937 . Beaton . himself was no slouch when it came to writing, and published his first . collection of works in 1930 with The Book of Beauty. By 1937, such was his success that he was selected to photograph the . wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1937 and Queen Elizabeth . herself in 1939. His love for costumery and flair for . fancy dress earned him Tony Awards for My Fair Lady (1957) and Coco . (1970) and Oscars for Gigi (1958) and the big screen adaptation of My . Fair Lady (1964). But . it is for his high society portraits that he is most famous, and . unsurprisingly, the parties held at his Wiltshire home, Ashcombe, were . legendary among his aristocratic friends. Fancy dress featured heavily and his costume balls became the highlight of the Wiltshire social calendar. One guest who was no stranger to dressing up was the Countess of Pembroke, who appears in the photos sporting an elaborate costume for her role in 'Heil Cinderella' - a pantomime co-written by Beaton in 1939 for the troops stationed at Wilton during World War II. In it, Beaton played one of the Ugly Sisters while the famously beautiful Countess of Pembroke took the role of the Queen. Other highlights include a charming self-portrait of Cecil on the Palladian Bridge at Wilton House taken in September 1968 and a striking image of him cavorting with friends, Stephen Tennant, William Walton, Georgia Sitwell, Zita Jungman and Rex Whistler at Wilsford in 1927. Despite . being pushed into a river at the first Ball he attended there in 1927, . Beaton later became great friends with the Earls of Pembroke. Over . time he photographed and chronicled the lives of three generations of . the family in the surroundings of the house which he described as . ‘perhaps the most wonderful piece in all Wiltshire’s heritage of . domestic architecture.’ On . 14th January 1980, just three days before his death, Beaton celebrated . his 76th birthday with a lunch party hosted by the family. Cecil Beaton at Wilton runs until 14th September. For more information, see wiltonhouse.co.uk .","New photos are part of a trove found at Wilton House in Wiltshire .

"Texas Governor Rick Perry announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to his state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico. 'There . can be no national security without border security, and Texans have paid too . high a price for the federal government’s failure to secure our border,' the Republican Governor said at a news conference this afternoon. 'The action I am ordering today will tackle this crisis head-on by . multiplying our efforts to combat the cartel activity, human traffickers and . individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across Texas and . America.' According to a memo leaked late last night to The Monitor, the executive action will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month. Scroll down for video . Done waiting around: Texas Governor Rick Perry said this afternoon that he is deploying up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico . Already, Perry has instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase personnel in the Rio Grande River Valley area at a weekly cost of $1.3 million. Added together, the two measures will cost $5 million a week, the memo reportedly states, and 'it is not clear where the money will come . from in the budget' other than 'non critical' areas like health care or transportation. The rise in border protection measures follows a surge of Central American children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico. More than 57,000 immigrant children, many of whom are unaccompanied, have illegally entered the country since last year, and the government estimates that approximately 90,000 will arrive by the close of this year. U.S. Border Patrol has been overloaded by the deluge, and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children. Congress is in the process of reviewing a $3.7 billion emergency funding request from President Barack Obama that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved, but House Republicans remain skeptical of the president's plan. Roughly half of the money Obama's asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning the them to their home countries. Furthermore, Republicans would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from non-contiguous countries who show up at the border health screenings and due process before they can be sent home. The judicial process often takes months, and even years, clogging up courts and slowing down the repatriation process. The president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to Congress that would have allowed the Department of Homeland Security to exercise the 'discretion' to bypass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home. Obama backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from Democratic lawmakers. Perry held a news conference with Attorney General Greg Abbott, right, this afternoon in Austin, Texas, to formally announce the deployment. Perry said the National Guard troops were needed to combat criminals that are exploiting a surge of children and families entering the U.S. illegally . Also not included in Obama's request to Congress was funding for a National Guard deployment to the border - something House Speaker John Boehner and the Texas Governor had both called on the president to do. Republicans say a National Guard presence is needed at areas of high crime to help Border Patrol agents crack down on smugglers and drug cartels. In a face to face meeting with Obama when the president came to Texas two weeks ago Perry again asked the president to deploy the National Guard through a federally funded statue but Obama resisted. Perry is now taking matters into his own hands, sending his own set of troops down to the Rio Grande Valley to aid law enforcement officials. State Senator Juan 'Chuy' Hinojosa, a Democrat who represents border town McAllen, criticized the Republican Governor's deployment as unnecessary. '[The cartels] are taking advantage of the situation,' he told the Monitor. 'But our local law enforcement from the sheriff’s offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation. 'This is a civil matter, not a military matter. What we need is more resources to hire more deputies, hire more Border Patrol,' Hinojosa said. 'These are young people, just families coming across. They're not armed. They're not carrying weapons.' The leaked memo on the National Guard deployment specifically denies that it is a 'militarization of the border,' however. And Perry's office reiterated today that troops would 'work seamlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials.' Hinojosa also accused Perry, who recently toured the border with Sean Hannity as part of a special for Fox News, of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border. 'All . these politicians coming down to border, they don't care about solving . the problem, they just want to make a political point,' he said.","Texas Governor Rick Perry announced this afternoon that he will dispatch up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the border .

"Boxer and former Birmingham City and Sheffield United striker Curtis Woodhouse has caused uproar on Twitter for messages on his profile ridiculing the Oscar Pistorius trial. Now retired from football at the age of 34, a post on Woodhouse's Twitter account read: ‘5 years for shooting your mrs, I’ve got a serious decision to make’, leading to a barrage of messages both in support and criticism of the Englishman. Many in defence of Woodhouse said the Tweet was in criticism of the sentence length given to Pistorius, rather than the glamourisation of domestic violence. Boxer and former Premier League striker Curtis Woodhouse caused uproar on Twitter on Tuesday . Woodhouse played three times in the Premier League for Birmingham City in 2002-03 . Woodhouse had initially wrote this tweet appearing to ridicule the sentencing of Oscar Pistorius . He then retweeted several messages discussing whether Pistorius, who was jailed for five years on Tuesday for the manslaughter of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, would play for Sheffield United on his release. This is thought to be in reference to the debate as to whether former Blades striker Ched Evans, released last week after being jailed for rape, would play for the club again. He later tweeted: ‘With oscars pace and cheds goal scoring ability I think the blades will go up this season now.’ Woodhouse also told some female followers on Twitter to ‘take your crying elsewhere please love’, ‘get kettle on’ and ‘go and burn your bra’ when they objected to his tweets. Woodhouse is now a professional boxer after 15 years in football. His record is 22 wins (13 by KO), 7 losses and no draws. He then joked that both Pistorius and Ched Evans could be playing for . He also spent four years at Sheffield United, playing 104 league games for the Yorkshire club .

"A homeless family of four who claim they cannot afford to rent privately have been sleeping in a car for a year because the council won't give them a house. Norman Karawaiez, 61, and his wife Carole, 56, kip in the silver Toyota Avensis together with their son Lewis, 21, and daughter Lamase, 20. The couple applied to be added to Bexley Council's housing register last September but they received a letter last week to say they do not fulfill the criteria because they do not have a proof of address for the past two years. Homeless: Carole Karawaiez and her husband Norman stand next to the car they are sleeping in with their son and daughter . The couple had their home in Sidcup, Kent, repossessed 10 years ago, and split up. Mrs Karawaiez, who is not entitled to benefits, and her children went to live with a cousin while Mr Karawaiez began living in his car which he also drives as a minicab. They got back together a year ago and have been sleeping in the car ever since. Mrs Karawaiez said: 'It's a nightmare. Me and my daughter lie at the back and my husband and son sleep in the front of the car. Bexley Council says the family does not meet criteria for a council house despite them sleeping in a car . 'I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. We're constantly bickering at each other.' The . former carer and mother-of-four says she has a shower at her other . daughter Leila's house and is picked up by her husband when . he finishes work at around 1am. For the last decade Mr Karawaiez (pictured right with his wife) has lived in his minicab - but has no proof of residence . She says the situation has taken its toll on their close-knit family, particularly her youngest daughter Lamase. She said: 'My husband's quite used to it as he's done it for the past 10 years or so but my son and daughter are getting really stressed. 'They're 21 and 20 but they act quite young for their age. 'My youngest took an overdose of prescription pills about three months ago and she's now waiting to go to counselling.' Mrs Karawaiez, who suffers from depression, says she can't work at the moment due to lack of sleep and not having a proper home. The family live off the income from Mr Karawaiez, who earns around £300 week working seven days a week at the Station Road minicab firm. Son Lewis, 21, is training to become a hairdresser at the Barber Shop Cafe in Welling High Street and takes home £50 a week. The family lived together in Sidcup before the house was repossessed because they couldn't afford to pay the mortgage after Mr Karawaiez was made redundant from his job at a magazine company in central London. Around six months later she moved to Plumstead where she lived until the summer of last year before getting back together with her husband. Bexley Council said: 'The family is comprised of a husband, wife and two children aged 20 and 21, both of whom are working. 'The family approached the service in . April this year and were advised that they should look to find private . rented accommodation as they are unlikely to be classed as in priority . need in light of the children being adults and both working. 'The . council has made a commitment to prioritise established Bexley families . in their allocations policy, which means having lived continuously in . the borough for two years at the point of application. The couple got back together last year but the family have been sleeping in the car ever since . 'As this is not the case with this family it is not possible to accept a housing application from them at this stage. 'Social housing is in short supply and the Council must look at the evidence of each case very closely as things are not always as they seem. It is the Council's duty to ensure that it gets value for money for its taxpayers and that those with the most need are prioritised.' In spite of the council's comment, the Karawaiez family say Lamase is not in work.","Norman Karawaiez and his wife Carole kip in the Toyota with son Lewis, 21, and daughter Lamase, 20 .

"Sir Alex Ferguson has heaped praise on Manchester United's bitter rivals Liverpool for their astonishing Premier League form in 2013-14 - describing the Reds as the 'team of the year'. Brendan Rodgers' side narrowly missed out on the Premier League title to Manchester City after rising from seventh the season before to finish runners-up in the last campaign. And Ferguson, writing in the updated chapters of his autobiography, admits he thought the Merseysiders were the standout side in the land. Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has described Liverpool as 'definitely the team of last year' Ferguson, who retired in May 2013 after 26-and-a-half years at Old Trafford, has updated his autobiography . The former United boss claims Brendan Rodgers' (right) side were extremely entertaining last season . Ferguson even goes as far as to say Manchester United fans could not 'begrudge' Liverpool their rise . * I spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their Manchester United futures... but dressing-room was out of bounds . * I tried to convince David Moyes to keep Mike Phelan as Manchester United assistant manager . *Louis van Gaal is formidable... and he and Ryan Giggs can learn from each other . *Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow . *I had nothing to do with David Moyes' sacking from Manchester United...

'From my perspective they (Liverpool) were definitely the team of the year,' writes Ferguson, who retired in May 2013 after 26-and-a-half highly-successful years at Old Trafford. 'They made their leap forward the right way: they played positive football.' The outstanding finishing of star striker Luis Suarez - who netted 31 league goals last year before moving to Barcelona for £75million - helped Liverpool to the brink of the title before they were pipped by City. Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling were also in imperious form for Rodgers' men, helping to make them one of the most feared attacking sides in Europe as the Anfielders bagged more than 100 Premier League goals. And Ferguson believes that such an exciting brand of football meant even United fans could not resent Liverpool enjoying last season's success. He continues in the new edition of My Autobiography, extracts of which were published on Tuesday, by stating: 'Even a United fan, seeing them as the nemesis, couldn't begrudge Liverpool their surge up the table - their form was amazing, brilliant.'

"Martin Odegaard only made his debut for Real Madrid Castilla at the weekend but the most talked about teenager in football was back training with Cristiano Ronaldo and Co this week. The 16-year-old Norway international entered the fray as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao B during the Segunda Division Group II clash at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium to make his official bow in the famous white strip.

Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and the rest of the Real Galacticos were given a training ground dressing-down earlier in the week by club president Florentino Perez in the wake of that defeat.

"A Kansas Middle School is under fire for a sexually explicit poster that was used in a sex-ed class. The poster hung up at Hocker Middle School asks: 'How do people express their sexual feelings?' and then lists a series of sex acts ranging from anal and vaginal sex to saying 'I like you' and cuddling on the couch. Mark Ellis told WDAF that his 13-year-old daughter was so shocked by the poster that she snapped a picture of it to show him. Scroll down for video . Banned: The poster on the left was pulled from Hocker Middle School in Shawnee, Kansas after parents found out it was being used in the sex-ed class . At first, he thought it was a joke but when he called the school he found out it was actually part of the sex-ed class curriculum and that's when he got upset. 'Who approved this?' he asked. 'You know this had to pass through enough hands that someone should have said, ""Wait a minute, these are 13-year-old kids, we do not need to be this in-depth with this sexual education type of program.""' At first, Shawnee School District spokesman Leigh Anne Neal defended the poster, saying it was in line with curriculum used across the country to promote abstinence. Appalled: Hocker Grove parent Mark Ellis (above) was shocked to learn that the poster wasn't a joke and was actually being used as part of the curriculum for his 13-year-old daughter . 'The item is meant to be part of a lesson, and so certainly as a standalone poster without the context of a teacher led discussion, I could see that there might be some cause for concern,' she said. Mr Ellis complained that the curriculum needed to change or else he would pull his daughter from the school. 'This has nothing to do with abstinence or sexual reproduction,' he said. 'I would like to see that this particular portion of the curriculum is removed from the school.' Mr Ellis was saved the trouble of having to transfer his daughter to another school when the poster was removed following a swift negative reaction. Superintendent Dr Jim Hinson says that even he finds the poster troubling. He says neither he or the school board approved the poster - it was something instituted by the curriculum department . Flip-flopping: At first, district spokesman Leigh Anne Neal (left) defended the poster as part of their abstinence-based curriculum, but eventually superintendent Dr Jim Hinson (right) took the poster down saying it was offensive even to him . 'I find that language offensive, I really do and so when we’re teaching human sexuality, again, there’s a balance. What’s appropriate at what age level? What’s not appropriate? It`s a really difficult decision,' Dr. Hinson said. At the same time, Dr Hinson says society has changed a lot and children know more about sex today than their parents may be aware of. Hocker Grove mother Jennifer Watland agrees, and that's why she signed a permission slip allowing her daughter Lyssa to take the sex-ed course. Defenders: Hocker Grove mother Jennifer Watland (left) won't take her daughter Lyssa (middle) out of the sex-ed class because of the poster . Daughter Lyssa isn't troubled by the poster because people her age are already sexually active and they 'don't know the consequences'. 'You can say all you want, that your children don’t know these things, but they’ve been knowing these things since maybe, the age of 10,' Lyssa said. Mother Jennifer says she found the poster 'alarming' but she's not going to take her daughter out of the class. 'I’ve read through my daughter’s Facebook, seen her news feed and her friends on there. The things they’ve posted, you’d be astounded,' she said.","The poster at Hocker Grove Middle School has since been banned following parental outrage .

"Oscar Pistorius was told he will face trial for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in March as he appeared in court today - the same day that would have been her 30th birthday. Wiping tears from his eyes, a visibly emotional Pistorius stood silently in the dock as he was formally indicted for premeditated murder at Pretoria Magistrates' Court. The 26-year-old Paralympian, from South Africa, is accused of shooting Ms Steenkamp to death at their home on Valentine's night, but claims he opened fire on the 29-year-old after mistaking her for an intruder. And after a hush finally descended on . the packed courtroom, the judge set his trial to run from March 3 to . March 20 next year at North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. Emotional: A visibly emotional Pistorius stood silently in the dock as he was formally indicted for premeditated murder at Pretoria Magistrates' Court . Birthday: The 26-year-old Paralympian wiped tears from his eyes and blew his nose as he was served the indictment on the day Ms Steenkamp (right) would have turned 30 . Family prayer: Before the hearing began he stood holding hands with sister Aimee and brother Carl as the three siblings prayed silently amid the commotion of the courtroom . Silent moment: Pistorius stands next to his sister Aimee and his brother Carl in silence as the courtroom commotion rages on around them . The prosecution will present 107 witnesses, some of whom allegedly heard a woman scream, followed by 'moments of silence, then heard gunshots and then more screaming', the indictment says. The state's witnesses will include Ms Steenkamp's close friends Desiree, Gina and Kim Myers, as well as Pistorius' sister Aimee and his uncle Arnold. Less than an hour after the hearing ended, Pistorius' brother Carl tweeted a photograph of Oscar and Ms Steenkamp posing together alongside the words: 'Remembered like yesterday. My life was impacted by u @reevasteenkamp & the lady u were! Always close to our hearts.' Before the hearing began he stood . holding hands with sister Aimee and brother Carl as the three siblings . prayed silently amid the commotion of the courtroom.

When asked by Magistrate Desmond Nair if he was well, he replied quietly: 'Under the circumstances, your honour.' But as . proceedings were postponed, the BBC's Andrew Harding claimed to have shaken his hand and . asked how he was, to which Pistorius apparently shook his head and . mouthed: 'Not good.' The six-time Paralympic sprint . champion was initially charged with premeditated murder for bail . purposes while police investigated the circumstances of the shooting before a finalised indictment was served on . the double amputee today. 'In our hearts': Less than an hour after the hearing ended, Pistorius' brother Carl tweeted a photograph of Oscar and Ms Steenkamp posing together alongside the words: 'Remembered like yesterday. My life was impacted by u @reevasteenkamp & the lady u were! Always close to our hearts' 'Not good'! As proceedings were postponed, BBC journalist Andrew Harding, who was sitting behind Pistorius in court, claimed to have shaken his hand and asked how he was, to which Pistorius apparently shook his head and mouthed: 'Not good' The . prosecution will retain a main charge of premeditated murder. If . convicted, Pistorius faces a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in . prison. The indictment accuses Pistorius of murder, and unlawful possession of ammunition, contrary to Section 90 of the Firearms Control Act. In a summary, prosecutors allege Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp, whose cause of death was given as multiple gunshot wounds, four times through the locked bathroom door but said, even if he thought she was an intruder, an 'error in persona' did not affect the fact he intended to kill someone. The summary alleges that Ms Steenkamp locked herself in the toilet cubicle next to the main bedroom at Pistorius' house in the early hours of February 14. It claims the athlete armed himself with his 9mm pistol and fired four shots through the locked door. The cause of his girlfriend's death, which happened just after 3am, is given as 'multiple gunshot wounds'. Some state witnesses heard a woman scream, followed by 'moments of silence, then heard gunshots and then more screaming', the summary said. It added: 'The accused said to witnesses on the scene, that he thought she was an intruder. 'Even then, the accused shot with the direct intention to kill a person. An error in persona will not affect the intention to kill a human being.' Some 107 witnesses are listed by the state, including Ms Steenkamp's close friends Desiree, Gina and Kim Myers, as well as Pistorius' sister Aimee and his uncle Arnold. Additional charged . are also 'possible', prosecutors told The Associated Press, but declined . to comment about the charges before today's hearing. It . has been reported that the Paralympian could face extra charges of . allegedly discharging a firearm recklessly in two other incidents. Papers . presented at the court today are expected to include a witness list and . detail some of the evidence police have gathered in the six months . since the death of Ms Steenkamp. Pistorius . is currently on bail after a judge changed his conditions in March, . allowing him to travel abroad providing he hand over his travel plans. The 'Blade Runner', who was recently . spotted kayaking with friends in South Africa, has resumed a 'low-key . track routine', according to his family. In a statement on his website in June, . they said: 'Oscar is not contemplating a formal return to athletics and . his training is not aimed at preparing for competition. 'His . focus at this time remains entirely on the court case. His family, and . those close to him, have encouraged him to spend a few hours a week on . the track to assist him in finding the necessary mental and emotional . equilibrium to process his trauma and prepare for the trial.' The . athlete was 'overcome with emotion' when he pulled on his carbon fibre . running blades for his first track training since Ms Steenkamp's death, . his agent Peet van Zyl said, adding that Pistorius described his return . to the track as 'bittersweet'. Ms Steenkamp's parents previously said they are still searching for answers. In . a television interview in June, June Steenkamp said: 'There is only one . person who knows what happened' on the night her daughter was killed. Meanwhile, Ms Steenkamp's uncle has said he has already forgiven Oscar Pistorius for killing her. Mike Steenkamp said the family have coped with her death by concentrating on her life rather than how she died. Support: Pistorius was greeted by his sister Aimee and his brother Carl as he took his place in the dock. Moments later the three siblings held hands and prayed together before proceedings began . The prosecution will retain a main charge of premeditated murder. If convicted, Pistorius faces a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison .

Chaos: The double amputee was met by a scrum of photographers as he arrived at Pretoria Magistrates' Court . Facing jail: The prosecution will retain a main charge of premeditated murder. If convicted, Pistorius faces a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison . In . an interview on ITV's Daybreak, Mr Steenkamp said: 'I think from the . beginning and onset that we decided that we could never be sidetracked . from Reeva's life, and I think that's helped us tremendously. 'I . just think of Reeva's life. How happy she was, and what she actually . meant to the family. Not only to her own parents, but to her cousins and . myself and my wife. She was an exceptional person.'He said he has . forgiven Pistorius, who is due to appears at Pretoria Magistrates' Court . today, for killing his niece because of his firm believe in God. He added that the family have not faced the Paralympic champion in court but would want to know the outcome of the case. Global spotlight: Prosecutors, who allege the Paralympian killed Ms Steenkamp (right) after an argument, submitted a list of more than 100 witnesses for a trial that will be followed around the world . Last hours: In this frame grab from CCTV footage shows Reeva Steenkamp entering the secured access to Pistorius' home hours before she died . 'We haven't attended anything and we haven't actually applied our minds to the court case or Oscar's side,' he said.

"Police are on the hunt for 'armed and dangerous, anti-government' couple who are accused of abducting their two young sons from the home of their grandparents just days after losing their parental rights, authorities said on Tuesday. Cole Hakken, four, and his two-year-old brother, Chase, were snatched by father, Joshua, at 6.30am this morning in Tampa, Florida. He drove off with his sons after tying up their maternal grandmother, Patricia Hauser. A national Amber Alert has been issued, the  Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office reported. Both boys have brown hair and brown eyes and were last seen wearing their pajamas. Abducted: Chase Hakken, aged two, (left) and his four-year-old brother Cole (right) were snatched by their 'anti-government' parents from their grandparents' home in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday morning . Hakken and his wife Sharyn, 34, are considered armed and dangerous. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Joshua Hakken waited until his father-in-law had left for work before he sneaked into the home and tied up Mrs Hauser with zip ties. Police were alerted two hours later after the grandmother managed to free herself and dialed 911. Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said in a statement: 'Both suspects are anti-government and have attempted a previous abduction at gunpoint in Louisiana.' Officials say the couple have been . stripped of their parental rights earlier this week after having the . boys removed from their care months earlier. Authorities in Louisiana have told . Florida deputies that the children were initially placed in a foster . care center. At some point, the Hakkens arrived at the facility armed . with guns and unsuccessfully attempted to enter it. Chase and Cole Hakken were later sent to live with their grandmother in Tampa, who was granted permanent custody of the boys. Joshua Hakken, 35, fled the home on Shady Shores Drive in Ms Hauser's 2009 Silver Toyota Camry. It is believed that they could now be traveling in a black 2006 GMC pick-up truck with Florida tag number U95KT. They may be pulling a 2012 Forrest River pop camper, Florida tag: BHNV-86. The . vehicle may have been spotted in the area of Highway 30 and Highway 411 . in Etowah, Tennessee Wednesday night around 8pm, WBIR reported. The couple also have . ties to Slidell, Louisiana, and may be heading there. Anyone with any information is . asked to dial 911 or call the Hillsborough County . Sheriff’s Office at 247 8200. The sheriff's office told CNN that . the Hakkens' troubles started last June when the husband was arrested on . multiple drug charges while attending an anti-government rally in . Louisiana. 'Armed and dangerous': Joshua Hakken, 35, (pictured left) and his wife Sharyn, 34, (right) are believed to have tried an abduction before in Louisiana . Crime scene: Officials say Joshua Hakken entered a home in the 14000 block of Shady Shores Drive owned by his sons' maternal grandmother, tied up the woman and abducted the boys . Detective Daniel Seuzeneau, with the Slidell Police Department, told WGNO that Joshua Hakken had first appeared on their radar in June 17, 2012, after causing disturbance inside a hotel that was the site of an anti-government rally. He described the father of two as being intoxicated and making incoherent statements. Hakken was arrested on multiple drug charges and jailed for about a week. Meanwhile, police contacted the Department of Children and Family Services, which took the Hakkens' children into custody. Sheriff's Cpl. Kevin Bodie told Tampa Bay Times that Hakken is a mechanical engineer who owns a business in South Tampa. His wife has been certified as a civil engineer. According to her Facebook page, Sharyn Hakken got her Bachelor's degree from University of South Florida in geotechnical engineering in 2001 before obtaining a Master's degree in civil engineering from USF in 2008. Wanted: Law enforcement officers stand in front of the home of Joshua Hakken at 3609 Sterling Avenue in Tampa as a K-9 dog searches the perimeter of the home . Last February, someone by the user name SailingBull posted on the libertarian forum Adam vs The Man that was started by Adam Charles Kokesh, an Iraq War veteran, activist and talk radio host who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in New Mexico. 'My name is Joshua Hakken,' the forum member wrote. 'I am a father, a registered professional mechanical engineer and a veteran of the USAF. I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America.' Hakken lamented that 'things here in Florida have not added up for quite some time,' and emphasized the importance of 'maintaining open communication lines for ideas, observations and news...if the ""good guys"" are to be successful in surviving to maintain the fight of ideas.' The couple own a home in the Virginia Park area south of Palma Ceia, where neighbors described them as a normal, average family. While Robert Lucas said the Hakkens were not overly outgoing, that did not seem like bad people. However, neighbor Lindsay Fleming recalled that one time, the parents were puffing on marijuana joints outside their home with their toddler sons nearby.","Joshua Hakken, 35, entered his mother-in-law's house at 6.30am on Tuesday in Tampa, Florida and restrained her with zip ties .

"A competitive eater has become the first person to eat one of the world's largest breakfasts by finishing a giant fry-up in just 21 minutes. Emma Dalton, 25, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, took on the Wonder Cafe Challenge on ITV's This Morning show and successfully ate  four slices of toast, four eggs, six sausages, six rashers of bacon, six hash browns, four pieces of black pudding, plum tomatoes, beans and mushrooms. In doing so, she became the first person to beat the Uxbridge cafe's breakfast dish challenge - a renowned competition that is considered to be one of the world's largest fried breakfasts. Scroll down for video . Emma Dalton pictured working her way through the huge breakfast meal on ITV's This Morning show . She told ITV's This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that she started eating competitively about 13 weeks ago when she 'smashed' a food challenge in Orlando. She claimed she had always been able to eat a lot, but admitted to starting to now put on weight after taking on food challenges once a week. Diners are given 45 minutes in which to complete the mammoth meal, but Ms Dalton finished in less than half the allocated time, putting down her fork after just 21 minutes - and around 5,000 calories. Competitive eater Emma Dalton started on the tomatoes (left) and didn't stop until she was finished . Anyone who can complete the challenge gets their meal for free, but those who fail have to fork out the £20 cost of the breakfast. And for those who still might feel peckish, the cafe also offers the Wonder Burger Challenge, consisting of a 36oz of 100 % Aberdeen Angus beef, topped with salad, onion rings, cheese and bacon, plus a side order of coleslaw and chips which must be consumed within 30 minutes. In recent weeks, telephone accounts manager Ms Dalton has managed to munch her way through a three-pound cake and burger in Orlando, Florida, a huge 48oz burger complete with eight rashers of bacon and eight slices of cheese in Southampton, and an eight pound burrito wrapped in 10 tortillas in Walsall, as well as an 80 oz steak and three-foot-long hotdog. The time in which she completed the challenge - 21 minutes - even surprised presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden. The cafe challenge stipulates diners must finish it within 45 minutes . 'I went to Orlando about 13 weeks ago and I just went from there,' she told the ITV show. 'I did one and smashed it.' Ms Dalton said she had found she was putting on weight since starting competitive eating, but put this down to the amount she eats other than the challenges which she undertakes once a week. 'I don't feel ill, but you do get the meat sweats you really do, it's a real thing,' she said. 'In the middle of the night you can't sleep, because of the quantity of the food you lie there and you feel hyperactive.' Incredibly, after completing the breakfast Ms Dalton managed to find room for some chocolate. 'It's so savoury, you need something sweet,' she said.

"Jodhi Meares has been a prisoner in her own home, suffered 'public humiliation' and considered going overseas to avoid scrutiny since flipping her Range Rover in June, her lawyer claimed in court today as the fashion designer was convicted of drink driving. Prominent Sydney solicitor Chris Murphy also said Ms Meares had been 'haunted' by her marriage to James Packer, although it only lasted for two and a half years, lived a modest life and was not a rich celebrity. Mr Murphy told the court the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over the space of four and a half hours while eating a small piece of lamb before she crashed her car in Bellevue Hill on June 21. After police arrived at the scene of the accident, she was arrested and recorded a blood alcohol reading of 0.181. Scroll down for video . Jodhi Meares pictured leaving Waverley Local Court in Sydney after she was convicted of high-range drink driving . Meares' lawyer Chris Murphy told the court the fashion designer had become a prisoner in her own home since the crash and downplayed her finances . Today Ms Meares pleaded guilty to a charge of high-range drink driving and was fined $1,100 and had her licence suspended for 12 months - a third of the possible penalty for the offence - during an appearance at Waverley Local Court in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Mr Murphy said Ms Meares had not made any money from her label 'The Upside', had had to pay staff for taking maternity leave and had given any profits to a Cambodian orphans charity, the Cambodian Children's Trust. 'Every garment that is sold by that business,  a payment is made to the Cambodian trust,' he said.'In this particular situation she has a business which is in its early stages, but it doesn't make money - but the cheque goes to the Cambodian orphanage ... with the slum children. 'She has worked all her life. She has a staffof eight people. Six women - three have been pregnant this year. She worries about these people.  She's a good person.' Mr Murphy also downplayed the worth of Ms Meares' assets. He said her two-bedroom Pt Piper apartment 'did cost $1 million over ten years ago - but her lifestyle is not ostentation'. He said Ms Meares' crashed vehicle was not worth the $200,000 quoted in the media, but $41,000 and, following the crash, just $2,500. He said she had been prescribed Beta Blockers for anxiety since her home had been under siege after the accident. Jodhi Meares's Range Rover lies on its side after she crashed it in Rose Bay in June, allegedly while she was over the drink-drive limit . Ms Meares was 'haunted' by her marriage to James Packer from 1999-2002, her lawyer claimed . Mr Murphy also tendered character references to the court, including statements from Ms Meares' mother and her rock star partner Jon Stevens, and said of the stress the ordeal had on his client: 'She has been restricted to her house for all but one day'. Mr Murphy also submitted a traffic report, a document explaining the crash and her intoxication, as well as four photographs from the accident and a character reference from former NSW police assistant commissioner John Laycock. He tendered the photographs to the court, along with statements which showed how Ms Meares had experienced 'increased opprobrium, public humiliation ... and stress' from the charges because she was well known. 'She was married for just over two years [to James Packer] and that haunts everything that's said it about it [the marriage],' he said. 'She's not a celebrity, she's not a movie star. She was raised by a single mother. They moved apartments every four months. There were four children, she went to three different high schools. 'She had the good fortune to make money in modelling, and in the late 90s, she created the label Tiger Lily, and married Jamie Packer. 'They were married for two and half years,' she said. Jodhi Meares (pictured left on holiday in Hawaii and right getting coffee in Bondi in 2009) allegedly had four drinks on the night and weighs 48kg . There was no sign of Meares' partner, rocker Jon Stevens, at court . Mr Murphy told the court Ms Meares had virtually been a prisoner in her own home since the crash. 'She has been restricted to her house for all but one day,' he said. The lawyer also said Ms Meares had contemplated going to live overseas because of intense media attention since the crash. 'The issue has got got so bad with the harassment I am trying to talk her out of leaving Australia,' he said. Mr Murphy said he had gone to the restaurant and asked them to pour two standard drinks, which he then photographed. Ms Meares sat with Mr Murphy and two legal associates for her matter to be heard. She earlier at 10.50am wearing a slim - fitting black pantsuit, a plain white shirt and high heeled black stilettos. She wore her golden tinged dark hair back in a pony tail and looked very tanned. Police Prosecutor Daniel McMahon told Magistrate Huber he would not argue with the character references or the statements about Ms Meares being restricted to home since the crash, but he would take issue with the traffic report tendered by Mr Murphy and the material relating to Ms Meares' intoxication and her 'state of mind'. Mr Murphy told the court a 'substantial part of the plea' he was arguing on Jodhi Meares behalf was that 'the one drink per hour rule ... doesn't work for females'. Jodhi Meares leaves her house to make her court appearance on drink driving charges, stylishly dressed in all black . Jodhi Meares gets into a car to travel to Waverley Local Court, left, and is ushered through a crowd outside court (right) Mr Murphy tendered scales which purported to show how men and women of particular body weights responded to one drink per hour in terms of blood alcohol readings. There was no sign of Mr Stevens, the fiancé of Ms Meares. Ms Meares owns the fashion label, The Upside. An earlier charge of driving while her licence was suspended had been dropped. Mr Murphy, had applied to the court earlier in the month for an adjournment while he had an expert crash investigator examine Meares' wrecked black Range Rover Sport. At around 9.45pm on Saturday, June 21 Meares was turning her black Range Rover Sport from New South Head Road into O'Sullivan St, Rose Bay when her vehicle collided with a line of parked cars. Meares' vehicle then jack-knifed and flipped onto its side and she had to be pulled from the wreckage. A dazed Meares was attended by paramedics but not taken to hospital. Magistrate Julie Huber gave Meares one of third of the possible fine and disqualification for high range drink driving, which can incur a maximum fine of $3300, three years' disqualification - and a naxinum of 18 months' jail for a first time offender. Jodhi Meares was married to James Packer for three years between 1999 and 2002 . Mr Murphy, had applied to the court earlier in the month for an adjournment while he had an expert crash investigator examine Meares' wrecked black Range Rover Sport . Ms Huber said she took into account Ms Meares' good character, her good driving record and the fact she had been the subject of intense media attention. She also noted a slightly hidden traffic island the intersection where the crash took place was ' an aggravated feature' of the accident. 'Having said that,' Ms Huber told Meares,  who was standing in the court to receive her sentence,  'had you been driving under the prescribed limit of under .05 the [chance of crashing your car] wpuld have been remote. 'I accept that when you drank you were surprised as to your reading. 'I have to say though, having regard to the level of your reading, it would have been unusual for you not to have been feeling the effects.' Ms Huber said she also noted that Ms Meares 'being a person of interest to the media you have found yourself in a situation where where you have been unable to leave your home ... and you have had fewer visitors. Jodhi Meares waits outside the court room for her appearance on high-level drink driving charges . After the June accident, police arrested her and took her to Waverley Police Station where she allegedly registered a blood alcohol level of .181, almost four times over the legal limit . 'Having said that it's been over a  relatively short period of time.' She arrived in a black Toyota Kluger four-wheel drive, travelling in the back passenger seat behind Mr Murphy who sat in the front next to a woman driver. Mr Murphy arrived at Ms Meares' Pt Piper home just before 10.30am in the Kluger to collect her and take her to court. One woman client at the court took a photograph of Ms Meares inside the building and was immediately admonished by Chris Murphy to delete the image.","Fashion designer also fined $1,100 and had her licence suspended .

"The man accused of killing one-punch victim Raynor Manalad will be the first person dealt with under new laws which could see him jailed for a minimum of eight years. Hugh Garth, 21, stands accused of striking the 21-year-old nursing graduate while the pair were celebrating a birthday party early on Saturday morning. If convicted, Garth could face a minimum jail sentence of eight years. He was today refused bail in a Sydney court where his charges were upgraded to assault causing death while intoxicated and causing grievous bodily harm. He will reappear in July. 'A beautiful sunset' Raynor Manalad was a recent university graduate with his whole career ahead of him, before he was killed by a single punch to the face . Tragic: Raynor Manalad was at a house party celebrating a 21st birthday party when he was hit by a punch to the face shortly after midnight on Saturday . Police will allege that during an argument with his girlfriend at the house party in Rooty Hill, Garth king-hit Raynor Manalad in the head while the victim tried to quell the conflict. He was transported to hospital, but died the following day. Mr Manalad was a recent Australian Catholic University graduate with his whole life ahead of him. His death is the third of its kind to claim a young life in Sydney since 18-year-old Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie died on the streets of Kings Cross. And like both of them, it appears Mr Manalad was yet another innocent victim. Friends and family have called for justice on Facebook declaring his death is yet another senseless act of violence. 'RIP Ray brother. Didn't know you well enough but through everything I've seen and heard the past few days you were loved by all. Heart goes out to all the family and loved ones. Rest well bro,'  Jeremy Nool posted to Facebook. Accused: Hugh Garth was fighting with his girlfriend before being accused of punching Raynor who was trying to quell the argument . Hugh Garth will appear in Blacktown local court on Wednesday where he will face charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, common assault and affray . Another friend, Alyssa, described him as 'a beautiful sunset.' 'Hearing about your passing hits me like a ton of bricks. I cannot believe that you are gone. It hurts that you are no longer alive because you where the person who would always keep the peace in the group.' The mother of the man accused of the killing is still in shock, first made aware of her son's arrest when approached by Channel Nine on Monday. 'I was watching 60 minutes, on the news Saturday, and that's when my heart was pumping,' she said. She also said the severity of the situation was 'hard' for her to deal with. Since the deaths of Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie, both 18, and a number of other serious assaults on Sydney's streets, new laws have been introduced to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks. The New South Wales government also introduced earlier lock-out and closing times for some of Sydney's busiest bars. Mr Christie was walking along the same street as Thomas when he was attacked by 25-year-old Shaun McNeil on New Year's Eve. Tragedy: A man has died in Westmead Hospital following another one-punch attack which occurred at a house party in Sydney's south . Mr Christie had been in a critical condition for 11 days before his family made the decision to turn off his life support. In December last year, Michael McEwen, 23, was attacked by up to three men at Bondi when he was punched to the ground and allegedly stomped on. All these incidences were the catalyst for new mandatory minimum sentencing laws imposed against people who commit such crimes. It was announced that anyone convicted of reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding a member of the public or a police officer while intoxicated can expect a minimum sentence of three to five years and a maximum penalty of up to 16 years. Former premier Barry O'Farrell said the new laws, which included a curfew on trading hours to 3am across the city, sent out 'the possible strongest message' that drug and alcohol-fuelled violence will no longer be tolerated.

"It had already been confirmed as the oldest animal that ever lived. But scientists who accidentally killed Ming the Mollusc, a deep sea clam dredged from the North Atlantic, have now discovered it was 100 years older than previously thought. Following painstaking analysis, experts from Bangor University reckon the animal was born in 1499, making it 507 when it was found. This is the only picture of Ming, believed to be the world's oldest animal at 507 years old. Not knowing the long life of the mollusc, researchers at Bangor University opened its shell for analysis, killing Ming in the process . Ming's life came to an abrupt end seven years ago when scientists from Bangor University dredged the seabed near Iceland (pictured) as part of a study into climate change . The ocean quahog was discovered off the coast of Iceland in 2006. Unaware of its age, scientists placed it in a freezer before opening and killing it by mistake. A quahog’s shell grows a layer every summer when the water is warmer and food plentiful. By counting the number of rings visible on the inside of Ming’s shell, scientists initially thought it was around 400 years old. By counting the number of rings visible on the outer shell of the mollusc, researchers calculated that Ming was an incredible 507 years old . However, after analysing the clam more closely, the experts now believe Ming, who was named after the dynasty thought to be ruling China at the time of its birth, was a century older. ‘We got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then,’ Paul Butler, from Bangor University, told ScienceNordic. The findings mean the mollusc was born seven years after Columbus  discovered America. It lay on the ocean floor throughout historical milestones such as the English Civil War, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution and two world wars. While the lifespans of different species may seem random, there is a pattern. Generally, big creatures live longer than small ones and this goes for plants as well as animals. At one end of the scale are mice and shrews, which live just a couple of years, while at the other are large animals like rhinos, hippos, giant tortoises, lions and elephants, which have life expectancies measured in decades - or even centuries. Some Galapagos tortoises, for instance, have been recorded to reach nearly 200 years. The bowhead whales have been found recently with antique harpoons embedded in their skulls dating from the 1790s. Unless these were a freak, this means that in the sea today there may be large, intelligent animals that pre-date the invention of the railway engine. Other Methuselahs include orange roughly, a Pacific fish increasingly popular as food. These cold-water fish can live to more than 150 years old, meaning that your dinner could date back to a time when Queen Victoria was still middle-aged. But there are some interesting anomalies. Humans, for instance, live longer than is to be expected for our size. Marine biologist Doris Abele believes that Ming's ability to live for centuries could be down to the creatures slow metabolism.","Scientists initially thought the clam, named Ming, was 405 years old .

"These adorable images of curled-up newborns are enough to warm the coldest of hearts. Lynette Blackie, 32, owner of photography firm Pasha Photography, loves nothing more than capturing infants while they sleep or interact with the camera. The award-winning photographer currently works from her home studio in Caldercriux near Glasgow, snapping the babies to give parents the perfect momentos of their newborns. Lynette Blackie, owner of newborn photography firm Pasha Photography, captures adorable images of curled-up newborns - some, like this one, involving some rather creative styling . Lynette, a self-taught photographer, revealed sessions with newborns can take anything between two and four hours but she always allows babies to dictate the show. Mother-of-three Lynette said: 'I generally ask that babies are brought for their session as soon after birth as possible - within the first two weeks is always the best time as they are still very sleepy at that age. Photographer Lynette Blackie loves nothing more than capturing the newborns' cutest moments - this one looks a little dubious about the suitcase theme . Lynette loves capturing young tots while they snooze, even if this means waiting until they drop off - sessions can take anything between two and four hours . Lynette, a self-taught photographer, says despite the sessions often taking hours, she always allows babies to dictate the show . Mother-of-three Lynette asks that babies are brought for their session as soon after birth as possible to capture those newborn moments . 'The sessions can take up to four hours which allows time for feeds, changes and posing. 'I only shoot one newborn session per day as I would never want to rush anyone or make the little ones feel uncomfortable. 'Babies can be crying one minute and laughing the next so it's just a case of being patient and not rushing the parents because if they're relaxed then the baby will be more relaxed too. 'I absolutely adore babies and young children so I've always found that I have a natural ability with little ones.' Lynette has a number of tricks up her sleeve to help the little ones doze off and perform the perfect pose. Lynette often incorporates props, such as teddy bears, and warms the bean bag and blankets before placing the baby on them to make sure they are snug and don't wake when they are placed down . She says the trick is having a great deal of patience. 'The baby has to dictate what we do and when we do it which is why they can take so long but it's always worth it in the end,' she says . Lynette loves her jobs and often makes clients cry with joy because they're so proud of her work . Lynette says people see her images and become broody, have a baby and then bring them in for a photography session . She added: 'I make sure the room is really warm and it always helps if the babies have just been fed so they are nice and comfortable. 'I also warm the bean bag and blankets before placing the baby on them to make sure they are snug and don't wake when they are placed down. 'The key to newborn photography is patience. The baby has to dictate what we do and when we do it which is why they can take so long but it's always worth it in the end. 'There aren't many jobs where you make your clients cry and feel good about it because they're so proud of what you've done. 'It's interesting because I often have people comment that my images make them broody so I've had a fair few clients that have gone on to have a baby and brought them to me for a photography session.'

"The Democratic Party is licking its wounds after losing a special election in Florida that turned into a referendum on Barack Obama, suggesting that the president has become an albatross around the necks of congressional candidates – and spelling election doom for November. Election prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote in January that the 13th Congressional District race was one that Democrats 'can't afford to lose.' Alex Sink, the losing Democrat, also lost a statewide race for governor in 2016 by a razor-thin margin, but carried the 13th district by 2 percentage points. Obama, too, prevailed there in both of his elections. But the special election, created by the October death of longtime Rep. Bill Young, was a different story. Jolly won by nearly 2 points in a race that cost the candidates a whopping $12.7 million. And Republicans of all stripes are crowing about it. Congressman-elect: Republican David Jolly was all smiles after defeating Democrat Alex Sink in an election that is seen as a referendum on Democrats' policies . The agony of defeat: Losing congressional candidate Alex Sink (C) was consoled by her son Bert McBride and her daughter Lexi Crawford (R) after she delivered a concession speech Tuesday night . Sink was 'ultimately brought down because of her unwavering support for Obamacare, and that should be a loud warning for other Democrats running coast to coast,' said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden Tuesday night. David Jolly, the former Young aide who won the contest, told Fox News Channel viewers on Wednesday morning that Sink lost because her party embraced Obamacare. 'I think it gives Democrats reason to worry going into November,' he said. Chris Cox, who runs the National Rifle Association's Political Victory Fund, blasted Sink for 'align[ing] herself with Michael Bloomberg and his anti-gun agenda,' and said Jolly prevailed because of his 'commitment to protecting our fundamental Right to Keep and Bear Arms.' The Florida Faith & Freedom Coalition took credit for mobilizing evangelical Christians. Jim Kallinger, the group's chairman, said in a statement that Jolly's victory showed the November elections 'will be a referendum on the failure of Obamacare.' The Susan B. Anthony List, a conservative group that promotes candidates who favor restrictions on abortion, claimed that the outcome was 'an early win for the pro-life movement.' Sink’s 'extreme pro-abortion views,' said the group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, 'put her far outside the mainstream.' When Rothenberg handicapped the race in a January  Roll Call column, he wrote that 'a Republican victory in March would likely say something about the national political environment and the inclination of district voters to send a message of dissatisfaction about the president.' 'And that possibility should worry the White House.' High-fives, for now: Jolly celebrated Tuesday night but will have to defend his seat in November . Jolly's victory was cheered by the late former congressman Bill Young's sons Patrick (C) and Billy (R), whose father succumbed to cancer in October . Jolly's win came despite Sink outspending him 3-to-1 on television ads. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee insists special elections are usually a 'poor predictor of November success.' Renowned political prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg set the bar high for Democrats two months ago, saying they couldn't afford to lose in Florida's 13th District. That theory will be tested this year, since Jolly must stand for re-election along with the other 424 members of the House of Representatives . The Tampa Bay Times reported that as Sink conceded . the race, some of her supporters . shouted, 'November! November!' according to The . Democrat did not, however, say whether she would run again for the seat . in this year’s general election, the newspaper reported. Outside political groups, whose attention was focused on the only congressional race this month, spent heavily on attack ads slamming both candidates. That money will be spread thin in November, especially in U.S. Senate races that have drawn the most attention as indicators of Obama's potential lame-duck status. 'I have very good news tonight,' Jolly told supporters are his victory party: 'No more commercials.' Famed game show host Bob Barker introduced him in a video message, shouting his well-known line from The Price Is right: 'Congressman David Jolly, come on down!' Jolly's win could indicate broad disenchantment with the White House's handling of Obamacare, the IRS tea-party targeting scandal, the Benghazi terror attack in 2012, the National Security Agency's broad digital surveillance programs, or any of several other negatives that the president will carry into November. The president didn't campaign with Sink despite flying to Florida for a golf trip less than a week before Election Day.","David Jolly's win over Alex Sink in Florida's 13th Congressional District may be a bellwether for Democrats' November woes .
The Florida 13th District race was the first real test of how well – or how poorly – Democrats are handling the White House's scandals .
The contest could be seen as a referendum on Obamacare, although Republican special interests are spinning it as a victory for gun rights, anti-abortion policies and a host of other narrow positions .
The campaigns spent $12.7 million on the only national election fought this month, but the victor will have to stand for re-election in November ."
"Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie views England's performance since the RBS 6 Nations as unsatisfactory. An encouraging runners-up finish in the Championship was followed by a run of five consecutive defeats, three on the summer tour to New Zealand and autumn losses to the All Blacks and South Africa. Victories over Samoa and Australia rescued a measure of respectability from the QBE series with only eight matches left for head coach Stuart Lancaster to build a team capable of winning next year's World Cup. England captain Chris Robshaw looks dejected after the QBE international defeat by South Africa . England lost 31-28 to South Africa in November in a close match at Twickenham . Ritchie rejects the notion that England have stagnated this autumn and - while disappointed by the recent losses - he is convinced they will be ready for the global showpiece on home soil. 'It's been a very hard schedule - we've played New Zealand four times on the bounce,' Ritchie said. 'I don't make any apologies for that because we want to be playing the best in the world and judge ourselves against that. 'We've played four times against New Zealand and lost four. Verdict: that's not satisfactory and we want to do better than that. 'Absolutely this isn't a development phase. We need to be and have to be competitive and beat those teams. Ian Ritchie (right) said England must do better after 'unsatisfactory' results since Six Nations . England were also beaten by New Zealand during the Autumn internationals . 'We need to be in a position of beating every team. That's what we have to do. 'But there is no doubt in my mind that the margin is pretty small. There's no chasm of difference. 'It's very marginal and now it's about making sure that margin is made up. That's the view of the coaching team as well. 'Next year I undoubtedly think we'll be stronger not weaker, whether that's because of the time the squad have to train together or the availability of players.' It was England's fourth defeat by the All Blacks since June after losing all three games of a summer tour . Ritchie still holds hope that the team will be stronger by the time the 2015 World Cup comes around . England have finished Six Nations runners-up for the last three years and Ritchie refused to be drawn on whether the 2015 Championship is a must-win tournament given the proximity of the World Cup. 'Every match is a must win. It's a perfect start to the Six Nations, against Wales in Cardiff on a Friday night,' Ritchie said. 'That's a good game to kick off with in terms of must win. And then the third game is in Ireland. 'We will lose games from time to time, that's inevitable. But our confidence in the coaching team is such that we believe we will get it right.'","England have won twice since finishing runners-up in the Six Nations .

"A remarkable collection of film frames created by a 10-year-old boy about the First World War have been revealed for the first time. The frames - which created by drawing scenes on to long strips of paper and shown to an audience by pulling them through slits in a cardboard box - were made by a young Charles Harold Wood, who went on to become a renowned film maker. Several of the frames make up a feature entitled Civilisation, Parts 1, 2 and 3. They depict an unnamed emperor who prepares for war for 20 years before attacking his neighbouring country. A 10-year-old CH Wood made a series of frames on paper detailing the events of the First World War. David Wood, son of the renowned film maker, discovered the collection when clearing out his father's home . Several of the films make up a feature entitled Civilisation, Parts 1, 2, and 3 - which follows an unnamed emperor preparing for war before attacking a neighbouring country . The frames - made on paper and shown to an audience by pulling them through slits in a cardboard box - are kept in small containers, pictured . Although neither Germany or England are mentioned in the films, it loosely follows the Great War through many of its famous battles. On one of the reels 'Another great empire comes to help the invaded country' is written. Elsewhere, a drawing of Trafalgar Square shows people crowding round Nelson's Column with the line 'Your King and Country Need You!' inscribed. Also included in the collection are a series of maps, handmade newspapers and director information. In one, the child has written the film would cost 'over £20,000 to produce, with a cast of 50,000 people, battleships, aeroplanes, motor cars, submarines and airships'. Three of the frames kept inside labelled containers . The 'films' were made by the boy between the ages of 10 and 14, Mr Wood pictured, said . It goes on to explain '80 pieces of heavy field artillery and 3,000 rifles were used, 400 tents were erected and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition were fired.' The young Mr Wood adds 'Real cities were built to be destroyed' and '12 ambulances were used'. The film was made by Charles Harold . Wood, more commonly known as CH Wood, an internationally renowned . photograher and film maker from Bradford, West Yorkshire. His . film maker son David, 70, discovered the movie along with six others as . he cleared out a storeroom at his home in Esholt. He said: 'This is the only thing I've seen that show the First World War through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy. One of the hand typed newspaper editions created by the 10 year old CH Wood. He would collect press clippings from local papers to make his own reports on the war . A hand-drawn map of Europe created by the 10-year-old Mr Wood. 'He would have spent hours creating these films and would have shown them to family and friends. 'I first discovered them 40-years ago when I was clearing out my dad's house and briefly looked at them, then I dug them out again 30-years ago to show my son and daughter. 'Now that I have more time I got them out again and just realised how fascinating and interesting they were. CH Wood, aged 12 when he would have been creating the films and newspapers . 'These were definitely his first ever foray into film, although these are single frame, not films.' He added his father, who . flew in the RAF in the Second World War, would have made the films between the ages of . ten and 14 alongside his self-published newspaper - of which there are . about 200 issues. The homemade newspapers, which he called 'The World's News' documented events both home and abroad. David said: 'He was an avid newspaper reader. He took notice of the way the pages were laid out as well as the content and he tried to reproduce it.' The papers even contained cinema listings, competitions and jokes. 'You could look at them for hours, it is so interesting to see how he saw the world, and to see the snippets of news about Bradford in the war years,' Mr Wood added. In a 1914 edition the young Charles mentions a Zeppelin alarm in Bradford and how it effected the city. Writing the next day he somberly reports on the number of people killed in an airship bombardment in East Yorkshire. The young Charles even brought out special supplements, including one on the navy, one on aeroplanes and one on the Russians. Mr Wood said: 'The writing becomes more sophisticated as Charles gets older. I think he started out just before the war, in 1913, using a John Bull printing set, but went on to use a proper typewriter.' Another map shows Europe. Mr Wood went on to be a pilot in the Second World War . He hopes now that his dad's collection will now be displayed in some form for the public to enjoy. He added: 'I would love to think it would go into some type of WWI centenary exhibition locally and if not maybe the War Museum would be interested later on. 'I'm very proud of my dad. I'm building up a scrapbook of things he did, for my grandchildren and great grandchildren. 'He had three great loves in life my dad, photography, motorbikes and flying. 'His main speciality in photography was aerial photography.' CH Wood died in 1980 aged 79, he had three children, David, Malcolm and Heather. Both Malcolm and David worked in their father's photography and film making busineess, CH Wood Bradford Ltd.

"A British soldier was snatched and executed by the Taliban yesterday after he wandered off alone from a remote checkpoint in southern Afghanistan. It was the first kidnap of a British soldier in the conflict. His disappearance in an area riddled with insurgents and Improvised Explosive Devices sparked a 12-hour search with hundreds of troops and vehicles and all available helicopters. David Cameron was forced to abandon part of an unannounced visit to the country so personnel and equipment which would have been with him could be diverted to help. Talks: David Cameron and Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai arrive for a joint press conference in Kabul this morning . Diplomacy: Mr Karzai gestures towards his British counterpart during the press conference. Mr Cameron is promising a surge in aid money to Afghanistan . Training: The PM meets Afghan National Army troops during a visit to their training camp at Camp Bastion, outside Lashkar Gah . The murder cast a shadow over what was supposed to be a victory tour for Mr Cameron to highlight progress in transforming Afghanistan and preparing for a withdrawal of British troops. The death of the British soldier showed the 'high price' being paid to stabilise the country, Mr Cameron said today. But he insisted the campaign against the Taliban in Helmand province was having 'success' and transition to Afghan security control was 'on track'. Speaking at a press conference alongside President Hamid Karzai in Kabul this morning, Mr Cameron said: 'This was very sad news and I want the thoughts and condolences of everyone on my team here to be with the family of that soldier who received this very sad news.' He added the incident was 'a reminder . of the high price that we have paid for the vital work we do in . Afghanistan and in Helmand province'. Last night the Ministry of Defence . confirmed that the soldier’s body was found inside a four-mile cordon . set up around the area he was last seen alive. It is understood he was shot in the . back of his head – which would indicate a cold-blooded execution – as . well as suffering other gunshot wounds.  Some of his equipment had been . stolen. An investigation is under way. The unnamed soldier was from the  4th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland and his family have been informed. He was last seen alive early yesterday after finishing duty at a vehicle checkpoint named  Salaang near a remote joint British and Afghan base in central Helmand province. Instead of returning to join  fellow members of 4 Scots he is said to have walked – armed and in full combat uniform – in the opposite direction. He was seen passing a checkpoint manned by the Afghan Army and said nothing as he walked into hostile territory. Taliban positions are often only a few hundred yards from those of Nato forces. Colleagues raised the alarm when he failed to return and a massive manhunt was launched involving British, U.S. and Afghan forces. Within hours, a Taliban spokesman claimed they had captured and killed the soldier after a fire fight but gave no further details. Security: David Cameron shakes hands with President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai at the presidential palace in Kabul this morning. He is expected to announce a 'modest' troop withdrawal later today . Conflict: Mr Cameron talks to Gulab Mangal, governor of Helmand province, at Camp Bastion. The PM was forced to cancel part of his visit after a British soldier was captured an executed by the Taliban . Under guard: Flanked by soldiers and security staff, Mr Cameron undertook a walkabout at Camp Bastion . Military insiders scotched reports . from Afghanistan that the soldier had been ambushed or that there had . been a fire fight between insurgents and British troops. A . Whitehall source said: ‘He finished his shift on duty at a vehicle . checkpoint and then, for whatever reason, he has gone and walked off on . his own. ‘Rather than heading back to the base . with the other soldiers, he has gone off in the other direction. That . was the last time he was seen.’ Checkpoint Salaang is close to the . Nahr-e-Bughra canal. It is also near the much fought over village of . Kopak, in the south of the Nahr-e-Saraj district, which stands on the . Shamalan canal. Brigadier Ed Davis, the commander of Task Force Helmand – Britain’s mission in Afghanistan – recently described the area as ‘one of the most dangerous in Central Helmand’. Mr Cameron quickly decided to abandon the centrepiece of his visit – a trip to see British soldiers in the regional capital of Lashkar Gah – so personnel and vital helicopters could concentrate on the search for the soldier. Embarrassingly for the Prime Minister, the security alert came in an area which he was claiming as the leading success story in Helmand. Lashkar Gah is part of the first phase of the transition from international control to Afghan security control, and is supposed to be fully passed over next month. Under fire: A Taliban source said that they captured the soldier after a firefight, but this was quickly scotched by military insiders (file picture) In captivity: The only known Nato soldier held by the Taliban is U.S. Private Bowe Bergdahl, pictured a month after his capture in 2009 . The three other servicemen  who have . previously been kidnapped in Afghanistan were American. They were all . captured or killed by the Taliban. In June 2009, insurgents captured Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl in the south-east of the country. They have released videos showing him in captivity dressed in Afghan clothing and military uniform. Sgt Bergdahl is seen denouncing the war in Afghanistan and calling for the U.S. to withdraw its troops from the country, in what the U.S. Military has called illegal propaganda. And in July 2010, two sailors from the U.S. Navy went missing in Logar province, south of the Afghan capital Kabul. Their dead bodies were found in the area days later. Only last week a British servicewoman described how Checkpoint Salaang had become embroiled in a firefight with insurgents. Able Seaman Heidi Telford  was with soldiers from the 1st Battalion The Rifles at the small checkpoint when they were ordered to provide cover for a patrol that came under attack. In total, 374 British servicemen and women have been killed since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001, including 26 this year. Defence chiefs have won a crunch battle over troop numbers in Afghanistan after David Cameron agreed to make only a ‘modest’ cut before the end of next year. On his visit to Afghanistan yesterday, the Prime Minister made clear that British frontline troops will be gone by the end of 2014. But he bowed to demands from generals not to reduce dramatically the 9,500 ground forces battling the Taliban before the end of next year’s summer fighting season. Battle: Mr Cameron, pictured alongside General Sir David Richards, second right, has chosen to make only a 'modest' cut to the numbers of troops in Afghanistan . Guard of honour: Mr Cameron walks past gathered American troops after his arrival at the base . When Mr Cameron makes a formal announcement to Parliament tomorrow he is expected to announce that no more than 500 troops will be pulled out before  autumn 2012. Yesterday he claimed Afghanistan was ‘entering a new phase’ where Afghan troops could shoulder more of the security burden. Mr Cameron said: ‘As that happens there will be opportunities to bring some British soldiers home. We’re talking relatively small numbers over a period of time.’ Britain’s most senior officer in Afghanistan, Lt-Gen James Bucknall, said recently that Nato troops need two more fighting seasons to suppress the Taliban. Most insurgents retreat during the cold winters. The Prime Minister confirmed he had bowed to the Army’s wishes. ‘You’ve got an enduring number of 9,500 this year and you’re not going to see a radical change for the fighting season of next year. ‘That’s not what this is about.’ Sharing a joke: The Prime Minister laughs with a group of soldiers who had gathered to meet him . Mr Cameron made clear that his deadline . of bringing combat troops home before 2015 is set in stone, regardless . of the situation on the ground. ‘I’ve always been clear. The end of 2014 . is a deadline. We won’t be here in large numbers or in a combat role,’ he said. ‘It is my judgment that it’s right for the British public to know, for the Afghan public to know and the Afghan and British military to know that there is an endpoint.’ Asked if the generals had won, a senior officer said last night: ‘We have. We have ended up in the right place.’ General Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence Staff, who was travelling with Mr Cameron, said British and Afghan troops were on course to allow a withdrawal of all combat forces by the end of 2014. ‘I think we are on track,’ he said. ‘The trick isn’t that we have completely finished off the insurgents but by the time we transition out finally, the Afghan National Security Force can handle it.’","Dead soldier was member of The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland .

"Brooklyn Beckham has reportedly signed an academy contract with Arsenal despite apparent interest from  Chelsea and his father David's former club, Manchester United. The eldest son of the former England captain was wanted by a number of Barclays Premier League sides, but the 15-year-old is understood to have opted for Arsenal after impressing coaches in north London. Brooklyn has been training with the Gunners and playing for their Under-16 side, having previously had trials with Chelsea, United, Queens Park Rangers and Fulham.

Brooklyn is the eldest son of former England captain Beckham, who played for La Galaxy for five years from 2007 . Brooklyn (left), who has been training with Arsenal and playing in their Academy sides with brothers Cruz (second from right) and Romeo . It is thought Brooklyn, who has experience on the right wing, could  be offered a professional contract if he impresses during his short-term deal in north London. Bookmakers Coral place Brooklyn at 14/1 to appear in the Premier League and 33/1 to play for England at senior level. Despite David's history at Old Trafford, the Beckham family have strong connections with Arsenal. The former Real Madrid midfielder's youngest son Cruz, nine, is a member of the Under-10 side while Romeo, 12, plays for Arsenal's Under-13s. Beckham Snr trained with Arsenal in January last year to keep fit after leaving LA Galaxy at the end of the Major League Soccer season, before joining Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain where the 39-year-old retired. An Arsenal source told the Daily Star: 'Brooklyn is talented and he has stood out in all of the training sessions and games he has played. 'He has had other teams sniffing around and it was always going to be a case of when, not if, he was signed up by a big-name club. 'Arsenal realise he can be a huge talent. They have seen that potential and protected their asset. The club has signed him, fending off interest from Manchester United and Chelsea in the meantime. Next summer we may see him sign a big-money deal and with Arsenal.' Professional contracts cannot be signed until the player is 17, but clubs can reach pre-agreements with their targets. As yet, there is no official word from the Beckham camp or Arsenal as to whether the reports are true.

"Andy Coulson asked no questions about Prince Harry's medical records obtained by former NotW Royal editor Clive Goodman, a court heard . Andy Coulson raised no questions when a reporter emailed him about Prince Harry's confidential medical files while he was editor of the News of the World, a court heard today. Former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, emailed his boss in January 2005 about Prince Harry being injured, jurors heard in the hacking trial today. This move effectively gave 'the game away' about hacking at the Sunday tabloid, a court heard. In the email, Goodman told Coulson that the 'health inf. is from the doctor himself scammed from Helen Aspey', in reference to a royal aide. Cross examining Goodman, prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: 'What you are telling him is you have been into Prince Harry's medical records and he does not ask you anything at all?' The witness agreed. Mr Edis said: 'Getting into anybody's medical records is a pretty serious thing for a journalist to do. You are telling the editor the second in line to the throne.' Goodman corrected: 'Third in line.' The lawyer continued: 'Never the less, whatever he was he is a pretty important person to be spying on. 'What you are saying to the editor here by some dishonest means, you have managed to obtain some confidential information.' Goodman accepted it was 'wrong and shouldn't have happened.' Mr Edis asked: 'Did he ever say anything to you about what you had done and whether it was appropriate?' Goodman said Coulson had not said anything, but the background showed there was a public interest in the prince's health. Mr Edis asked: 'Are you saying there was a conversation about public interest in this story?' The witness said there was no conversation with the editor. The prosecutor asserted: 'It's a pretty strong clue about what it is - the health information comes from the doctor himself, scammed from Helen Aspey - so you are not trying to hide what had happened from Mr Coulson. 'If you had wanted to hide what you were up to you would be a lot less open. In cross examination Goodman, pictured, said the records were obtained by dishonest means - which was 'wrong and shouldn't have happened' 'You are giving the game away. If he thinks about this carefully he can probably work out what's gone on. 'You did not think there was anything to hide.' Goodman replied: 'At that point I don't think Andy Coulson was aware I was phone hacking.' Mr Edis replied: 'This email is pretty much telling him.' Coulson denies charges of conspiring to hack phones and making corrupt payments to public officials. Goodman is not accused of hacking in the current trial but also denies conspiring to pay public officials. The Old Bailey trial was adjourned until 10am on Monday.

"A geese tsunami was the colourful description given by a Canadian cameraman after he filmed an extraordinary natural sight in Richmond, Canada. Maikel Parets was filming thousands of birds who had landed on a baseball field to take a break just south of Vancouver in British Columbia during their annual migration. The sea of geese was impressive enough, but then they took off - those at the back went first with the others following as if they had choreographed their departure to look like a giant wave. Scroll down for video . Resting: A giant gaggle of geese rest on a baseball field in Richmond, Canada, before a spectacular take-off . Stirring: Some further geese join the group from overhead as the geese start to move before departure . Parets repeatedly says 'Oh my God' as the geese begin the next phase of their journey by speeding directly at him before spectacularly flying over his head, with every moment captured. While Parets marvelled at the sight, one woman at the end of his video is seen checking her hair for an unfortunate deposit from one of the birds. Mr Parets said: 'I was spared and not even one of their poop touched me but the lady at the end of the video was not that lucky.' Varri Raffan, of the George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary, told Global News he was not surprised to see the large gaggle of geese travelling together as they are known to 'stick together'. Take-off: Suddenly the geese at the back take flight before those in front follow, creating a tsunami effect . Spectacular: The thousands of geese continue their migration south from  Richmond, Canada . Raffan said geese are very family oriented, particularly remaining in large groups for migration and feeding purposes.

"A mother leaves her young daughter tethered all alone on the other side of a door outside a betting shop on a busy street before going in to place a bet. This was the shocking scene  in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, captured by office workers who couldn't believe their eyes yesterday afternoon. They saw the curly-haired girl, aged around four, being left tied by her reins outside a branch of Ladbrokes opposite their place of work for two to three minutes. She appeared to struggle to free herself before the woman, believed to be her mother, came out. Scroll down for video . Left outside: Pictures show the girl on her own by the door of the betting shop in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, as the mother places a bet .

"Sergio Aguero hopes there are plenty more goals to come after smashing four past Tottenham to become Manchester City's record Premier League scorer. The Argentina striker scored all City's goals as they overpowered 10-man Spurs 4-1 in an enthralling clash at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Aguero's haul took him to 61 in the competition, three past compatriot Carlos Tevez's mark of 58 for the club, to 85 in 132 City appearances overall. Sergio Aguero struck four goals for Manchester City against Tottenham on Saturday . Aguero reeled away in celebartion after putting Manchester City back in front against Tottenham . Aguero sent goalkeeper Hugo Lloris the wrong way when converting his first penalty of the afternoon . Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games) Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games) Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games) Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games) Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) It was a devastating reminder of his talents now that the fitness concerns that have hampered him throughout 2014 finally seem behind him. 'I am very happy to be part of the history of this club and I hope I can continue scoring goals,' said Aguero, whose City strikes include the memorable injury-time effort that clinched the title in 2012. 'But the most important thing is City can win games with my goals. 'I was very happy with my performance but the most important thing is we got the three points.' Aguero's performance could hardly have come as a surprise to his countryman Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager. Prior to the game Pochettino had equated Aguero's play to the musical genius of Mozart, and his subsequent display reignited debate over where the forward ranks among the world's elite. Comparisons with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were commonplace a year ago before a sequence of muscle injuries ravaged the second part of his 2013-14 campaign and his World Cup. Aguero opened the scoring against Spurs with a precise finish after 13 minutes and then restored the lead from the spot seven minutes later after Christian Eriksen hit a quickfire equaliser. He then had another penalty saved by Hugo Lloris but he completed his hat-trick with a third spot-kick after another Argentine, Federico Fazio, had been sent off for pulling him back. It also came soon after City goalkeeper Joe Hart had remarkably kept out a Roberto Soldado penalty at the other end. Another crisp Aguero strike completed the scoring 15 minutes from time. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino was full of praise for his fellow countryman before Saturday's game . Aguero with a signed match ball after the game . James Milner hit the post late on and in the final analysis City, and particularly Aguero, could have scored several more, such was the threat they posed. But Spurs were also dangerous and before Aguero's 68th-minute third goal the contest was very open. Hart came to the champions' rescue on a number of occasions. Hart said: 'It was an exciting game - two exciting teams and luckily we got the better in the attacking stakes. 'They played well, they attacked well, they are quite similar to us in their style of play. 'But Kun (Aguero) was amazing with the goals he scored and could have got more.' Spurs forward Ryan Mason felt the final outcome did not do the visitors' efforts justice. Like City, Pochettino's side were more comfortable in attack than defence and had they taken more chances the result could have been very different. Mason himself was twice denied by brilliant saves from Hart in the first half. The 23-year-old, who also had a hand in his side's goal, told Spurs TV: 'The lads are devastated because we came here to win the game and I think we had a good chance. 'The penalty miss was massive and then obviously the sending-off killed our momentum. It was a 4-1 scoreline but I don't think the game reflected that. 'I think we created quite a few chances. The gaffer wanted us to press high up the pitch and when we got it right we countered, and our first goal came from that.' Tottenham's Ryan Mason, pictured tackling Fernando, was happy with his performance against City . On a personal level, Mason was pleased with his own performance. Mason, who has had loan spells with Yeovil, Doncaster, Millwall and French club Lorient, has been given a chance by Pochettino and seems determined to take it. He said: 'On a positive note I felt I did all right, but we have lost the game, so it is a bit bitter-sweet. I am a bit gutted about that. 'But we have got a massive game Thursday and we have got a game at the Lane next week against Newcastle and hopefully we can put things right there.'

"A U.S. publication appears to have Photoshopped a baby bump onto the Duchess of Cambridge's slender frame. Star magazine, which claims to reveal that Kate is pregnant with twins, published an image of the British royal from her recent visit to Singapore on the cover of its latest issue. The 30-year-old is seen standing in what is quite a typical pose, with her shoulders back and hips forward, with her arm resting across her midriff, as she toasts Mary Tan, the President of Singapore's wife. Photoshopped? Star magazine has been accused of retouching an image of the Duchess of Cambridge for its latest cover (left) to make her appear pregnant. The original version of the image can be seen on the right . However the gossip site Celebuzz suggests that Star Magazine has taken the liberty of retouching the photograph, to make it appear as though the Duchess's stomach is larger than it is. On comparison with what it believes to be the original photograph, the site says there are several glaring clues indicating that it has been airbrushed to suit the title's headlines. It reads: 'Not only has is her floral slim-fit frock been mysteriously . blown out... but Prince William‘s . wife is mysteriously missing her right-hand ring.' Comparison: MailOnline laid a ghost of the Star magazine cover over the original image to compare the two, and it does indeed appear that there are some differences .

Furious: Demi Lovato took to Twitter to vent her anger over the magazine's headlines . The Duchess's entire torso looks to have . been widened, and the angle of her left arm and the glass she holds seem to have been altered, with Mary Tan's glass removed from the frame . entirely. The cocktail ring is missing from her right hand, as is the shoulder of a woman in the background, just seen in the original. Kate's face, eyes and teeth have also been lightened. In MailOnline's overlay composite, the Star cover and the photo beneath were matched using the position and size of the Duchess's eyes to ensure that they were in perfect proportion with one another. Star magazine, which is yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment, accompanied the image with a sensational coverline of: 'Scandal turns to joy: It's twins!' Two bullet points beneath add: 'Pregnant Kate gets thrilling news amid nude photo uproar... Up to 125lbs and showing.' The inside story cites a . 'family friend', 'insider' and a 'source', who apparently told the . title that the Royal couple conceived during a 'passionate night' in . Wales after the London Olympics. It . is Star's second cover in a row claiming to reveal that the Duchess is . expecting. Just last week it suggested that stitching in the waistband . of one of Kate's dresses was proof that it had been let out to make . space for 'mommy weight'. Bold claims: Star published a similar headline on last week's issue, again claiming the Duchess is pregnant .

"England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster has been told performances during the autumn series were unacceptable. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie said he felt ‘frustrated’ and ‘disappointed’ watching England extend their losing streak against New Zealand and South Africa to five Tests before victories over depleted Samoa and Australia belatedly salvaged the autumn. Ritchie, who awarded the England coaching team unprecedented six-year contracts in October, will hold a full review with Lancaster in the coming weeks, but his end-of-term report delivered to the head coach clearly read: must do better. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has demanded that Stuart Lancaster improves England's performances . Lancaster has been told he must get more out of his team with the World Cup taking place next year . Though stopping well short of questioning Lancaster’s future and insisting England remain firmly on track for next year’s World Cup, Ritchie said: ‘We have to be and we should be in a position where we go into every game expecting to win and wanting to win. ‘Therefore if you lose, whether it’s to New Zealand or South Africa, it’s a combination of frustrating and disappointing. We need to make sure we’re doing all we can to remedy that. ‘Against Samoa and Australia it was nice to get a couple of wins. But to be clear; we should be expecting to win every game we play. We are extremely committed to ensuring that happens. You find it very frustrating. I sat in New Zealand and watched us lose three. You then lose again to them. ‘For a lot of the games we were highly competitive. But we still fell short, so it’s not an accident when you lose four out of four.’ England began the autumn missing seven British Lions through injury while Lancaster’s decision to select inexperienced backs, including Bath youngsters Anthony Watson and George Ford, left the side lacking some international experience. Lancaster was criticised for picking the inexperienced duo of George Ford (left) and Anthony Watson . ‘I’m not going to sit here, and I don’t think Stuart does either, saying there are reasons why this happened or that happened,’ Ritchie added. ‘I don’t think it’s really worth doing that. ‘We have to make sure that, come the most important day next September we are absolutely in the right place to do that. Don’t take anything in terms of “this is a development team” or “we’re a learning team”. ‘No, no, no. We need to be and have to be competitive and beat those teams. We have to be in a position of beating every team. ‘I think it’s been a very good schedule. I don’t make any apologies for that because I think we want to be playing the best in the world and judging ourselves. But we want to do better.’ Lancaster (left) congratulates England team captain Chris Robshaw after victory over Australia . England’s next match is against Wales in Cardiff on February 6 and Ritchie remains confident Lancaster and his coaching team will turn results around. ‘Do I still believe fervently that we are in a good position for next season and for Rugby World Cup? I absolutely do,’ he added. ‘I think we have the talent, the ability and I think we have the resources and commitment to back up the team.’","RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie blasts England's November performances .

"A magnetic gadget is having remarkable success in alleviating RLS, also known as Ekbom's Disease . It sounds faintly ridiculous – but restless leg syndrome (RLS), characterised by uncomfortable twitches in the muscles of the legs, brings misery to millions  of Britons. Some experts suggest that up to 15 per cent of the population could be affected, and although many simply put up with the condition, some are prescribed sleeping pills, anti-epileptic drugs and benzodiazepine, all of which can have serious side effects. Now, a magnetic gadget is having remarkable success in alleviating RLS, also known as Ekbom’s Disease. Nine in ten patients who used the device – a Velcro-adjustable leg-wrap – found it eased symptoms, according to a study by Dr Nyjon Eccles, who specialises in alternative and complementary medicine at The Hale Clinic in London. The LegCare wrap is fitted below the knee and above the calf muscle. During the study, patients wore their wrap 24 hours a day for one month. After five months, the majority said pain, twitching and tingling was reduced by 50 per cent. By comparison, just 20 per cent of users said drugs offered relief, and one in ten found natural therapies helped. RLS is thought to be due to problems in the parts of the brain that control movement – in particular the neurotransmitter dopamine – but doctors do not know the precise cause. Just how the wrap works is also not known, though some studies suggest there may be an improvement in circulation and a calming of the nerve signals. Yet numerous studies have shown magnets work no better than sham treatments in a host of illnesses they have been claimed to treat. Sufferers of RLS are mainly female. Pregnancy has been reported to offer temporary respite from the twitching. Others say it worsens after the menopause. Natural remedies found to be effective include supplements containing magnesium and iron tablets, although the latter should be used only in individuals with proven iron deficiency.

'Mouritz has been a massive part of our squad and our culture for the past five-and-a-half seasons, and we are very sorry to see him leave,' Saracens rugby director Mark McCall said.

Having qualified for England on residency, he made his Test debut as a replacement against 2011 World Cup warm-up opponents Wales at Twickenham before going on to start every game of England's 2012 RBS 6 Nations campaign. Saracens said they had 'reluctantly released' 32-year-old Botha, who will join the Durban-based Sharks with effect from January 1 . He won 10 caps, the last of which was against South Africa in November 2012. Botha said: 'Saracens will always be important to me, and it's difficult to leave so many friends in what remains a unique sporting environment. 'But the Sharks are trying to build something special in Durban. This will be a great rugby challenge for me, and a great adventure for my young family.'","Mouritz Both to join The Sharks in January .

"Being confident and loud is the best way to win an argument - even if you are wrong, a new study suggests. Researchers from Washington State University drew this conclusion after studying the activity of Twitter users. The more opinionated they were, the more influential and trustworthy they were perceived to be. They analysed more than a billion tweets posted during various American sporting events, including the 2013 Super Bowl, to the test whether being accurate or being confident made Twitter users more popular. Despite professional pundits and amateur fans making a similar amount of correct and incorrect predictions, the tweeters who 'yelled' louder were seen as more trustworthy and had more followers. People who are 'loud' and confident on Twitter are more popular and influential, even if what they're tweeting is inaccurate, say researchers. The economic students behind the research developed a software program to analyse a billion tweets looking for words that were considered confident, such as 'destroy' and 'annihilate' A study by the Georgia Institute of Tech found that Twitter users . who posted positive, easy-to-read messages that contained news and other . factual information, gained 30 times more followers than grumpy, . self-centred tweeters. They put together some tips for gaining new followers: . Don't talk about yourself: Informational . content attracts followers at a rate 30 times higher than personal content. Users talk about themselves in . 41 percent of their tweets on average. Be . happy: Stay away . from negative posts such as death, unemployment and poor health. Use hashtags sparingly: Using too many hashtags  puts people off. Researchers found that Twitter . users with a high 'hashtag ratio' attracted less followers. To test the theory, two economic students from the university studied the language used by sports pundits who often 'yell' for attention. Jadrien Wooten and Ben . Smith compared the tweets of professional pundits - celebrities with verified Twitter . accounts - with amateur tweeters that claimed to have some sports . expertise in their bio. The pair then developed a software program to sort through more than a billion tweets looking for predictions for major sporting events in the US, such as the 2013 Super Bowl in February. The program pulled out tweets with . team names, nicknames and expressions commonly associated with . predictions, such as 'beat' and 'win'. Words like 'vanquish,' 'destroy' and 'annihilate' posted in Tweets were considered to be confident words. The researchers used these confident words in place of being able to measure loudness online. The researchers developed a software program and formula for analysing how confident tweets were. They compared this to how accurate the tweets were, how many tweets a user posted each year, how many people favorited their tweets and the number of followers each one had. From this they were able to find a mean average and compare professional and amateur tweeters to each other . The research found that the professionals were correct with their predictions 47 per cent of the time. Whereas the amateurs made accurate predictions in 45 per cent of cases. However, the professionals were more confident, scoring a .480 confidence rating compared to the amateurs' .313. If . a professional pundit accurately predicted every game of the baseball . playoffs and series, the authors estimated his or her Twitter following . would increase 3.4 per centr . While an amateur would get 7.3 per cent more followers. A confident professional would increase . his or her following by nearly 17 per cent, whereas a 'loud' amateur would get . 20 per cent more followers. More than a billion tweets were analysed during  US sporting events, including the 2013 Super Bowl, so researchers could test whether being confident, or being accurate, was the key to Twitter popularity and influence. The study found that the 'louder' people tweeted, the more followers they gained despite only being able to correctly predict the scores in less than half of cases . The authors claim that this shows people are more willing to trust 'loud' amateurs, despite their supposed lack of authority on the subject, than 'loud' professionals. Wooten said: 'In a perfect world, you want to be accurate and confident. 'But if you had to pick, being confident will get you more followers, get you more demand. 'They're trading away some of their accuracy. ''I might not be right all the time but I can yell louder than this other guy.'"" Smith and Wooten added that tweeters get a better audience through confidence and the excitement it generates. Researchers Jadrian Wooten, left, and Ben Smith from Washington State University claim that this shows people are more willing to trust 'loud' amateurs, despite their supposed lack of authority on the subject, than 'loud' professionals . A study by market research agency Pear Analytics found that almost 40 per cent of tweets contain 'pointless babble' such as ‘I’m eating a sandwich’. Almost as many tweets were purely ‘conversational’ - like a text message. And just 8.7 per cent of all tweets were deemed of ‘value’ with worthwhile news content. The remaining 9.6 per cent of tweets were classed as self promotion and spam. Smith added: 'There is some psychological literature on the idea that people hate uncertainty. 'The fact that people don't like uncertainty would suggest that they don't like the idea of a person standing up there and saying, 'I'm only 90 percent sure.'"" Wooten concluded: 'I like to think of it like a roulette wheel. 'If you have somebody just placing bets, that person is kind of boring. But if you have someone going, 'Oh, yeah! It's red!' and they are confident, that's the person that you are interested in.' Smith originally wanted to test the . accuracy of stock market pundits, based on tweets from CNBC host Jim Cramer, whom Wooten called 'the . yelling genius that he thinks he is.' Yet the pair realised that stock predictions don't have a set date in which a prediction comes true, and they were unable to prove when a pundit had been right or wrong. The pair presented their findings earlier this year at the 50th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Economics and Finance.","Researchers analysed more than a billion tweets from pundits during American sporting events .

"Accused: The women, who haven't been named, managed to fight Peter Mesko, 22, pictured, of Honesdale, Pa., off and run away after the alleged rape on Saturday morning . A Cornell University wrestler has been charged with rape after a female student caught him having sex with her friend while she slept and took pictures of him with his pants around his ankles to show police. The two women, who haven't been named, managed to fight Peter Mesko, 22, of Honesdale, Pa., off and run away after the Saturday morning incident. But the alleged victim's friend went back after the attack to take photos of the accused, which the two used to look him up on the Ivy League school's athletic department website, police said. Mesko was charged on Tuesday with first-degree rape. He was freed on $5,000 bail for a court appearance tomorrow. According to the Ithaca Journal, court papers said the two women had gone out to a Collegetown tavern with friends at around 11 p.m. on Friday night then fell asleep at the friend's house at around 1 a.m. The alleged victim told police she had had two beers, a shot of tequila and a whiskey and Coke. The friend was woken up around 1:30 a.m. by her housemates who had invited friends over to play drinking games. When she asked them to quieten down, she noticed some Cornell wrestlers were among the party guests. The alleged victim said she woke up at 4:45 a.m. to find a stranger raping her, and her cries awoke her friend. 'I woke up confused and uncomfortable and said, ""I don't like that, stop!""' she recalled, according to the Journal. The two women managed to shove Mesko off and run from the room, police said. While they were fighting the athlete, the friend recognized him as one of the wrestlers from the party. Charged: Mesko, pictured, was charged on Tuesday with first-degree rape. He was freed on $5,000 bail for a court appearance tomorrow . The female students locked themselves in an upstairs room but a few minutes later, the friend crept downstairs to take pictures of the man she recognized. 'I quickly took two pictures of him, he said aloud ""no"" when he recognized that I had taken them,' the woman recalled. She ran back upstairs before Mesko allegedly followed and attempted to kick the door down. 'He tried to push the door twice and was twisting the door knob,' the alleged victim recalled. 'I said ""it's occupied"" and then we heard his footsteps go away from the door.' About half an hour later they dashed from the building and noticed Mesko still at the house, asleep on a futon. Scene: Kent Hubbell, the Dean of Students at Cornell, pictured, said the arrest has 'shocked' the university community . The alleged victim went to an emergency room to have a rape exam done, then contacted police. According to the Cornell website, Mesko is a junior in the school of agriculture. Last year, the wrestler took third place in a New York State intercollegiate tournament. Police said they did not know if he had a lawyer. His phone number was unlisted, and a call to his parents' home on Thursday went unanswered. Police Officer Jamie Williamson said the assault took place off campus. He declined to say whether the alleged victim was a Cornell student. University officials had no comment. 'The arrest this week of a Cornell student charged with raping a fellow student has shocked our community,' Cornell Dean of Students Kent Hubbell said in a statement posted on the university website. He said a new website has been set up to provide support for victims of sexual violence as well as those troubled by the reported rape.","Peter Mesko, 22, of Honesdale, Pa., was charged on Tuesday with first-degree rape .

"For the first time, America's racial and ethnic minorities now make up about half of the under-5 age group and will be a majority by this year or next. That's according to new census numbers that show a faster shift than expected toward a minority-majority, one where whites will be in the minority by 2043. The new estimates also show that, for the fist time in more than a century, the death rate for white Americans outnumbers the birth rate. Slow shift: Children under 5 in America will soon be over 50 percent non-white. By 2043, white Americans will be in the minority . The Census Bureau reported earlier this year that non-white babies now outnumber white babies. Fueled by immigration and high rates . of birth, particularly among Hispanics, racial and ethnic minorities are . now growing more rapidly in numbers than whites. Based on current rates of growth, . whites in the under-5 group are expected to tip to a minority this year . or next, Thomas Mesenbourg, the Census Bureau's acting director, said. The government also projects that in five years, minorities will make up more than half of children under 18. Not long after, the total U.S. white population will begin an inexorable decline in absolute numbers, due to aging baby boomers. New census numbers indicate that white Americans are shifting towards a statistical minority. Last year's numbers indicated that white babies are now a minority. Now the under age 5 group will soon be made up of over half racial minorities. As of 2012, 49.9% of children 5 and under were racial minorities. By this year or next, the number will be over 50%. The number of deaths now exceeds the number of births in the white American population for the first time in a century. The non-white population as a whole has increased to 37 percent of America. Fastest growth is among Americans who consider themselves multi-racial . Non-Hispanic whites currently make up 63 percent of the U.S. Non-hispanic whites remain the majority in America, but last year saw more deaths in the demographic than births. There were . The actual number of non-hispanic whites in America actually went up, however, due to 188,000 white immigrants to the U.S. from countries like Canada and Germany. According to the Washington Post, the sharp decrease in births versus deaths was a surprise to analysts, who now project the phenomenon to occur regularly starting in the year 2025. One contributing factor to the shift is age. Whites are generally older than other races. The median age for a non-hispanic white is 42. For Asians, it is 34, it's under 32 for African Americans and Hispanic Americans have a median age of under 28. Another factor is fertility. Female fertility rates have dropped considerably in white women since the start of the recession in 2007. In that group, fertility rates are now below levels necessary to maintain their population. Demographer Ken Johnson from the University of New Hampshire told the Washington Post that non-hispanic whites are still choosing not to have children, despite a better economy. And that will be exacerbated once the baby boom generation begins to die off. 'Once this recession has waned, we’re probably going to see at least a temporary uptick in births until death rates start to rise,' he said. The Census reports that the number of whites will peak following resumed baby-making from an improved economy at around 2024 when the oldest of the baby boomers will be approaching 80 years old. Surprise stats: Some of the changes to the U.S. population in 2012 were unexpected. There was a negative 'natural' population change of 12,400, meaning over ten thousand more white Americans died last year than were born . The imminent tip to a white minority among young children adds a racial dimension to government spending on early-childhood education, such as President Barack Obama's proposal to significantly expand pre-kindergarten for lower-income families. The nation's demographic changes are already stirring discussion as to whether some civil rights-era programs, such as affirmative action in college admissions, should be retooled to focus more on income rather than race and ethnicity. The Supreme Court will rule on the issue this month. Studies show that gaps in achievement by both race and class begin long before college, suggesting that U.S. remedies to foster equal opportunity will need to reach earlier into a child's life. ‘The educational system is likely to be the most widely used and most acceptable policy tool we have for equalizing life chances. But it does not seem so far to achieve this goal,’ said Timothy Smeeding, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specializes in income inequality. ‘This specter of unequal opportunity may be the biggest negative social outcome of the continuing American inequality boom.’ The gap between rich and poor in the U.S. has now stretched to its widest since 1970, making opportunities to reach the middle class increasingly difficult. Longer-term changes in family structure, such as a decline in marriage, have led to a rise in single-mother households across all racial groups, with the fastest growth now occurring among whites. More than 40 percent of newborns are now born out of wedlock, in families more likely to be low income. All in the numbers: The rate of death, too, now exceeds the rate of births for American whites and racial minority babies already outnumber white babies . ‘More so than ever, we need to recognize the importance of young minorities for the growth and vitality of our labor force and economy,’ said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who analyzed the census data. Smeeding's analysis of the latest research and data on social mobility, provided to The Associated Press, shows that a child's achievement varies widely depending on a parent's education and income. The reason: More educated parents tend to have fewer children and generally earn more money than before, allowing them to spend larger amounts of time or money on a child's development, including music or art classes, extra tutoring, or travel and summer camps. The gaps in achievement tend to emerge early in childhood, continuing through high school, and disparities are especially evident in SAT admission scores. College Board data show that average scores spread as wide as 130-140 points in each of the reading, math and writing sections for a student with family income of less than $20,000, compared with a student with family income exceeding $200,000. About 40 percent of whites age 25-29 graduate from college, compared with 15 percent for Latinos and 23 percent for blacks. Multiple factors: Just as more children are being born to racial minorities than to whites, the white death rate is now higher than the birth rate for the first time in a century . Obama proposed expanding pre-K education for any 4-year-old whose family income was below twice the federal poverty rate, or $46,000 for a family of four. That is an increasingly minority age group that would benefit from what Obama calls the single most effective way to boost educational outcomes. The plan would be paid for by a nearly $1 per pack federal cigarette tax. But at a time of strapped federal budgets, Republican lawmakers have been reluctant to expand the scope of government or raise new taxes. Medicare and Social Security costs due to aging of the mostly white baby boomer generation are also adding to the government burden. A recent Rutgers University study found that state funding for pre-K programs had its largest drop ever last year, with states now spending less per child than a decade ago.","Census numbers show that racial minorities will make up over half of kids under 5 .

"The 'lost city of Atlantis has eluded explorers for centuries and is almost certainly the stuff of myth. Staggeringly, though, an ancient city that is Atlantis in all  but name has emerged from under the sea near Alexandria — and now the  lost world of Heracleion is giving up  its treasures. Just as in the classical tale, Heracleion was once a prosperous, thriving city before it was engulfed by the sea around 1,500 years ago. It was grand enough to be mentioned by the Greek writer Herodotus, the 5th-century BC historian. He told the fabulous story of Helen of Troy, the most beautiful woman in the world — she of the face that launched a thousand ships — travelling to Heracleion, then a port of ‘great wealth’, with her glamorous Trojan lover, Paris. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A colossal statue of an ancient unknown Pharaoh (left) lies on a barge in an Alexandrian naval base after it was uncovered in the ancient submerged city of Heracleion. French marine archaeologist Frank Goddio (right) explains text on the stele of Heracleion . Franck Goddio and divers from his team inspect the statue of a pharaoh . Among the most important monuments that were discovered at the temple area of Thonis-Heracleion is this monolithic chapel dating to the Ptolemaic period . But no physical evidence of such a . grand settlement appeared until 2001, when a group led by French marine . archaeologist Franck Goddio stumbled upon some relics that led them to . one of the greatest finds of the 21st century. Goddio was in search of Napoleon’s . warships from the 1798 Battle of the Nile, when he was defeated by . Nelson in these very waters, but came upon this much more significant . discovery. Goddio’s team has since been joined by . the Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology and the Department of . Antiquities of Egypt to produce a wealth of dazzling finds. The archaeologists first faced the . mammoth task of reassembling massive stone fragments on the seabed . before they could haul them to the surface. Twelve years on, their . fabulous finds have been exposed to public view for the first time after . more than a millennium spent beneath the silt and water of Aboukir Bay, . 20 miles north-east of Alexandria. Among the discoveries are colossal . statues of the Egyptian goddess Isis, the god Hapi, and an unidentified . Egyptian pharaoh — all preserved in immaculate condition by their muddy . burial shroud. Along with these 16ft statues there are hundreds of . smaller statues of Egyptian gods — among them the figures that guarded . the temple where Cleopatra was inaugurated as Queen of the Nile. It seems the Amun-Gereb temple at . Heracleion was the Egyptian equivalent of Westminster Abbey, where our . own Queen was crowned 60 years ago. Dozens of sarcophagi have been found, . containing the bodies of mummified animals sacrificed to Amun-Gereb, the . supreme god of the Egyptians. Many amulets, or religious charms, have . been unearthed, too, showing gods such as Isis, Osiris and Horus. These were made not just for the . Egyptians but for visiting traders, who incorporated them into their own . religions and also, one imagines, kept them as trinkets to remind them . of their far-flung journeys. The importance of Heracleion has been . further proved by the discovery of 64 ships — the largest number of . ancient vessels ever found in one place — and a mind-boggling 700 . anchors. Other finds illustrate how crucial . Heracleion was to the economy of the ancient world. Gold coins and lead, . bronze and stone weights from Athens (used to measure the value of . goods and to calculate the tax owed) show that Heracleion was a . lucrative Mediterranean trading post. An archaeologist measures the feet of a colossal red granite statue at the site of Heracleion discovered in Aboukir Bay . The statue of the Goddess Isis sits on display on a barge in an Alexandrian naval base (left). Pictured right is a colossal statue of red granite representing the god Hapi, which decorated the temple of Heracleion . An international team of marine archaeologists is preparing to show some of the objects found in the underwater city . Heracleion was mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus, who told of Helen of Troy visiting the city with her lover Paris before the Trojan war . In the ancient world, the . Mediterranean Sea was their equivalent of a superfast motorway. All . their greatest cities, including Constantinople, Rome and Athens, were . either on the coast or on rivers with easy access to it. And now Heracleion can be added to . their number as Egypt’s most important port during the time of the later . pharaohs. It was, if you like, a major motorway junction — the spot . where the Nile, Egypt’s lifeline, met the Med. Archaeologists have . determined that as well as having a naturally navigable channel next to . its ancient harbour, a further artificial channel appears to have been . dug to expedite trade. The Heracleion finds will add . tremendous depth to our understanding of the ancient world — not least . because, among the discoveries, there are perfectly preserved steles . (inscribed pillars) decorated with hieroglyphics. Translated, they will . reveal much about the religious and political life in this corner of . ancient Egypt. It was a similar inscription on the . Rosetta Stone — discovered in the Nile Delta town of Rosetta in 1799 by a . French soldier, and now in the British Museum — that cracked the code . of hieroglyphics in the first place. And like the Rosetta Stone, those . steles found beneath the waters of Aboukir Bay are inscribed in Greek . and Egyptian, too. Who knows how many more archaeological gems will be . uncovered at Heracleion? The very name of the city is taken . from that most famous of Greek heroes, Heracles — aka Hercules — whose . 12 labours, from killing the  Hydra  to capturing Cerberus, the . multi-headed hellhound that guarded the gates of the Underworld, . captivated the ancient world. Heraklion, Crete’s capital and largest . city, is also named after Heracles, as was Herculaneum, the ancient . Roman town that was buried under ash when Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. It appears that Heracleion faded in . importance in the later classical period, eclipsed by its neighbouring . city of Alexandria, which became the capital of Egypt in 312BC. Still, Heracleion lingered on, later . under Roman control, until it slipped into its watery grave some time in . the 6th or 7th century AD. What a thrilling discovery we have on our . hands now that the sea has, 1,500 years later, given up one of its . greatest secrets. The ancient port city lies 20 miles northeast of Alexandria in the Mediterranean . Items including 16ft sculptures, gold coins and giant tablets are among some of the objects recovered from the ancient port city .

"Nestled in the buzzing streets of west London, Knightsbridge has long been considered a playground for the rich and famous. And every summer Arab playboys speed around its polished streets in garish super cars worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. But one Russian woman has given the young men a run for their money - by parking her crystal-encrusted Mercedes outside an exclusive hotel for  the world to see. Scroll down for video . Dazzling: The unique Swarovski-crystal encrusted Mercedes was parked outside The Levin Hotel in Knightsbridge, west London, this afternoon . With every last inch of the already luxurious car covered in crystals, the vehicle attracted the attention of onlookers who are used to the garish cars of Arab playboys . Privileged: The 21-year-old student said she wanted something 'unique' and is glad so many people admire her car - but worry some drivers might crash if they look at it for too long. Miss Darionova, a business studies student in London, said she when she is ready to sell the car she will give the money to charity . At £55,000  many would consider the Mercedes CLS 350 an extravagance in itself. But Daria Radionova made her 2014 model even more luxurious, by covering it entirely in Swarovski crystals. 'I wanted to have something unique and do something special,' the 21-year-old business student said. 'The people who did it came over from Russia and worked for 12 hours a day for two months on the car. 'I am really happy with it and I am looking forward to driving it around. 'It has only just been finished and everywhere I go people stop to have a look at it. 'It gets lots of attention from people walking by and in cars. Sometimes I think they might crash. 'Everyone is taking pictures of it. When I sell the car I will give the money to charity.' Onlookers stopped to admire the vehicle which usually costs around £55,000. It is not known how much Miss Radionova spent on her bespoke treatment . A man gently places his hand on the car to feel some of the thousands of Swarovski crystals that have been stuck on to its exterior by a bespoke team . Blingtastic: No detail has been spared in the custom-job which is thought to have cost experts two months to complete. The car attracted attention in London this afternoon . The Mercedes CLS 350 is usually the trademark of company executives and luxury taxi services but has been given a blingtastic makeover by Miss Radionova . Sparkling: Even the car's door handles have been included in the transformation which Russian-born Miss Radionova shared on her Instagram page . Just in case: A small plastic bag of spare crystals rests on the passenger seat in case any of the one million crystals on its exterior falls off . The dazzling car attracted more attention than any other that staff at The Levin Hotel had seen before including some of the more garish models driven by men . As night fell the vehicle twinkled and sparkled as Miss Radionova drove home. The luxury jacket trader gave it the aptly named registration plate 'baiibyy' Miss Radionova poses with a friend on the bonnet of her custom Mercedes CLS 350. The 21-year-old is studying business in London but is originally from Russia . The Mercedes CLS 350 is covered in one million individual . Swarovski crystals. Each was painstakingly applied by hand by a group of workers . who flew over from Russia especially for the project. They worked for 12 hours a day for two months straight to . attach the diamonds, worth £20,000, to the car. Every single part of the vehicle has been covered in the crystals, from . the bumper to the rear, right down to the door handles and wing mirrors. The 2011 Mercedes model, which is a diesel and is owned by . 21-year-old Russian Daria Radionova, is now said to be worth much more than its . average £55,000 asking price. Daria, who . shares her privileged adventures on Instagram, uploaded a photograph of . the finished product to the photo and video sharing website accompanied . with the hashtags: '#crystal 'crystalcar #knightsbridge #harrods and im . not an #arab guy (sic)'. Parking outside the Levin Hotel on Basil Street near Harrods today, the car drew in crowds of admiring onlookers. A manager said: 'We have seen a lot of unusual cars like Ferraris parked outside but I think this one has got the most attention. 'If you have the cash why not do it? It looks good and fun.' Every summer supercars are flown to the area by their wealthy owners in their droves. The most outrageous car to make the trip over this time around is the six-wheeled Mercedes G63 AMG, an enormous £370,000 off-roader. A 220mph Pagani Huayra, worth more than £1 million, has also attracted attention from tourists and passersby. There is also a gold Range Rover, various Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis and Ferraris, numerous Bugatti Veyrons and a 1970s Datsun. The rich Arabs stay in the best hotels and empty their wallets in London's most expensive shops, but they also cause problems with their unique supercars. Residents in affluent Knightsbridge have complained they are behaving in an anti-social manner, revving the cars and treating the exclusive area as their personal racetrack. The garish cars are usually the domain of wealthy Arabs. This Mercedes CLS - starting price £82,000 - was parked on Chelsea's Sloane Street in August . A Qatari-owned £200,000 Ferrari 458 in front of a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador. The cars attracted gangs of camera-wielding youths, dubbed the 'Carparazzi' in Knightsbridge this summer .

"The son of Australia's richest woman, Gina Rinehart, has called his youngest sister an 'oxygen thief' in the latest battle over the family's multi-billion dollar trust, a Sydney court has heard. The youngest Rinehart, Ginia, has sided with her mother against her siblings and the NSW Supreme Court heard on Tuesday that John Hancock had expressed contempt toward her. But Bianca Rinehart, who temporarily fell out with Mr Hancock, defended his comments despite telling her mother in 2004 she was 'deeply concerned about (his) reckless bite the hand that feeds you approach'. Scroll down for video . Bianca Rinehart, the eldest daughter of Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, appeared at Sydney's Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue why she should be allowed to take control of a $5 billion family trust . '(It's) not a personal attack,' Bianca told the court. She added that her brother's drinking and gambling problems had been 'damaging in the past'. 'He doesn't want to see the family business left in the hands of someone ... he feels isn't up to the job,' she said. The youngest Rinehart, Ginia (left), has sided with her mother, Gina (right), against her siblings and the NSW Supreme Court heard on Tuesday that John Hancock had expressed contempt toward her . The contempt Mr Hancock had for Ginia was born of worry about who would be 'assuming real and great responsibility of taking over the family company', according to Bianca. She and Mr Hancock have since reconciled, with Mr Hancock backing her bid to take charge of the family's $5 billion trust. The court heard their mother Gina reportedly sent Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett an email encouraging him to convince  Bianca to withdraw her bid to control the trust rather 'than be found a liar in the witness box', the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Bianca, Ms Rinehart's eldest daughter, said her younger sister Hope Welker 'was pretty much at her wit's end' and felt 'kicked in the stomach' after the way she was treated by Mr Hancock. 'All I feel is pain and anxiety. You are kicking me in the stomach,' Hope emailed her brother in February 2013, Bianca told the court. Ms Welker has withdrawn from the protracted legal debate for control of the family trust, distressed at the way it was proceeding, and dealing with her own divorce.

"It’s the happy ending that Lily the blind great dane and her trusty friend turned guide dog Maddison deserve. When the Daily Mail featured the heart-warming tale of the two great danes, who were looking for a new home, more than 2,000 dog lovers responded by offering to take them. Now Lily and Maddison are moving from the Dogs Trust centre in Shrewsbury to live with the Williams family 35 miles away in Crewe, Cheshire. Happy ending: Len Williams and his wife Anne with blind Lily and her guide dog Maddison. The couple have taken in the two dogs after reading about them in the Daily Mail . Lily, six, was barely a puppy when she was struck down by a condition that caused her eyelashes to grow into her eyeballs, damaging them beyond repair. Thankfully her friend Maddison, seven, became her new eyes and led her everywhere. The two have become inseparable and Lily follows Maddison, almost touching her as they walk so she knows where to go. But in July their owner could no longer cope with them and they were sent to the re-homing centre. Forever friends: Lily, left, being guided while . walking with Maddison right. The pair have been inseparable since Lily . lost her sight . Anne Williams, 52, and her husband Len, 53, a retired fireman, fell in love with the dogs when they read about them in the Mail and their offer was accepted by the trust. Mrs Williams, a business manager for an insurance company, said: ‘We've always had two dogs together, I like them to have company and so taking on two of them wasn't a daunting prospect. 'My daughter moved out five months ago, taking her two English setters with her, so the house has felt a little quiet without them. Playful: Lily's lack of sight has heightened her . other senses so she can often tell if Maddison is nearby without the . pair touching . ‘We live in the countryside and I miss having a reason to go for a walk - I can't wait to take the dogs out with us. We've also got a lovely big garden so it's the perfect setting for two huge dogs.’ The couple plan to take the great danes on holidays to France and the Lake District and ensure they both enjoy life with their new family. Louise Campbell, manager of the Dogs Trust in Shrewsbury, said: ‘This is the happy ending we were all hoping for and everyone is delighted for Lily and Maddison. ‘The Williams family were the perfect match and we know they'll give the dogs all the love and fuss they so deserve.’","Couple decided to take in Lily and Maddison after reading about them in the Daily Mail .

"A huge property grab by Chinese investors is pricing UK homebuyers out of the market. Developers are increasingly selling direct to buyers in China at inflated prices, cutting out domestic purchasers altogether. Last night, critics said such tactics threatened to further destabilise the overheating property market and deepen the housing shortage. A computer-generated image of the proposed development at the Ram Brewery in Wandsworth, London. The new Chinese owners of the historic seven-acre-site have openly admitted they will be targeting foreign buyers . Major British developers including Barratt Homes and Berkeley Group have opened offices in Beijing and Shanghai to cater for growing overseas demand for new-build apartments in premium city-centre locations. The phenomenon is not restricted to London. In Birmingham, 30 per cent of flats in the prestige development The Cube have been sold to the Chinese. Some investors have children studying at British universities. Others simply see flats as a safe haven that offers significant rental growth. The Bank of China is also offering mortgages in sterling to Chinese investors. House of Fraser, one of Britain’s oldest department store chains, is the latest UK household name to be sold to the Chinese. The . firm, which was founded by drapery store owners Hugh Fraser and James . Arthur in Glasgow in 1849, has agreed the £450million sale with . Sanpower, owner of a leading Chinese department store. Sanpower . plans to expand House of Fraser – which has 61 stores in Britain and . Ireland as well as one in Abu Dhabi – into other countries. It has . annual sales of about £1.2billion. Brands . recently bought by Chinese investors include Weetabix, black cab maker . Manganese Bronze and James Bond’s tailor Gieves & Hawkes. Also, Beijing Construction Group is part of a consortium investing £800million in Manchester Airport. Michael Sacks of property development firm Sequre said: ‘New-build apartment blocks in Britain’s city centre are being bought en masse and then re-sold overseas, mostly to the Chinese, for significantly more than what they are actually worth. ‘This is causing acute shortages in the cities because entire schemes under construction are snapped up, making it harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder. ‘It will inevitably force up prices on second hand stock but this is artificial and not due to sound fundamentals. ‘This is reminiscent of 2007, just before the property crash, when people were buying property without doing their due diligence and simply believing the sales hype that the market is booming.’ He said that in northern cities such . as Liverpool and Manchester, many new-build flats were being sold to . Chinese investors for 25 to 30 per cent above market value. Recent . studies have revealed many parts of the country are in the grip of a . house price bubble. Prices in some London boroughs have risen by 30 per . cent in just a year. Other hotposts such as Manchester and Brighton have . seen double-digit increases. Last . night, Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes called for tougher rules to . prevent housing developers selling exclusively to overseas buyers. He said: ‘I believe that it should be a . legal requirement of receiving planning permission that these . properties are advertised here first.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable admitted home ownership had become ‘unaffordable’ to the middle classes. House of Fraser, one of Britain's oldest department store chains, is the latest UK household name to be sold to the Chinese . He warned that the bubble developing in the housing market could prove to be more serious than during the last property crash. Mr Cable said: ‘The fundamental problem is a chronic imbalance between supply and demand. 'A recovering mortgage market is just fuelling demand again. A family on an average income is nowhere near able to afford a house at the average price.’ He pointed out that the stamp duty net has been widened to catch more wealthy foreigners who buy homes in Britain through company structures to avoid tax. Research by estate agent Savills found 51 per cent of prime Central London property was sold to overseas buyers in the last 12 months.  This figure rose to 80 per cent for prime new-build properties in the capital. In South London, the new Chinese owners of the historic Ram Brewery – a seven-acre site in Wandsworth – have openly admitted they will be targeting foreign buyers. The £600million site will be turned into a new ‘town centre’ with 661 new homes, shops, bars and restaurants. Last night, Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes (pictured) called for tougher rules to prevent housing developers selling exclusively to overseas buyers . But instead of supplying much-needed housing to local residents, it will be bought mainly by ‘rich and middle-class Chinese’, admitted Zhang Yuliang, the chairman of Shanghai-based developers Greenland Group. Angela Lin of JA One, a firm helping Chinese investors to find property in London, said her clients saw the UK market as a ‘safe place’ to invest. She said: ‘People in China want to invest in the UK because it has steady growth.’ But Adam Challis, head of residential research at Jones Lang LaSalle, said the trend should be welcomed. He said: ‘After the economic downturn it became very difficult to secure this kind of investment. ‘So the reality is that it was the international investors who stepped in. As a result, there is more housing for British people, not less.’ New figures from Halifax yesterday showed prices rose by 8.7 per cent in the year to March, the highest rate of   increase since October 2007. A controversial scheme to make mortgages cheaper will be scaled back within months, a well-placed source has said. The . maximum purchase price allowed under the Government’s flagship Help to . Buy scheme is to be cut from £600,000 to £300,000 to address ‘misplaced’ concerns that it is fuelling a house price bubble, senior figures . believe. Because the . average cost of a house bought using the scheme’s mortgage guarantee is . £148,048, they do not believe the change will have much impact on . buyers. Under the . scheme, the Government guarantees up to 15 per cent of a homebuyer’s . mortgage so long as they can muster a 5 per cent deposit themselves. Business . Secretary Vince Cable has claimed that backing purchases of up to . £600,000 risks overheating the property market, but Chancellor George . Osborne insists he has ‘not seen any evidence’ that Help to Buy is . fuelling a rise in house prices. A . well-placed source said: ‘The Chancellor is under pressure to reduce . the  maximum value of the properties that can  be bought and if he’s . advised to do it by the Bank [of England] there is speculation  that he . will do so in his Mansion House speech in June.’","Developers selling directly to buyers in China at inflated prices .

"The cargo plane crew members who perished in a fiery crash in Afghanistan included a man who married just two weeks ago and another who was engaged, it has been revealed. Seven American crew members of the . private cargo jet were killed on Monday when the Dubai-bound plane crashed shortly after take-off from Bagram air base near the . Afghan capital of Kabul. Heart-stopping dashcam footage of the crash hit the web hours later, showing the Boeing 747-400 climbing steadily before plummeting back to the ground in a massive explosion. Just married: Brad Hasler, a pilot who was killed in the tragic plane crash in Afghanistan, is pictured with his new wife Robin in this wedding photo from two weeks ago . Yesterday, the names of the tragic crewmembers - all working for National Airlines - were released. Six of them were from Michigan. They included pilot Brad Hasler of Trenton, Michigan, who married his longtime girlfriend just two weeks ago. The couple had a 2-year-old child and another on the way, his brother said. Tragic: Plane crash victim Michael Sheets was engaged to be married . The brother, Bill Hasler, told WDIV-TV: 'If I could trade places with him so that he could be with his family, I would in a heartbeat.' In a statement to NBC News, Bill Hasler added: 'Brad was a wonderful father to two young children, a beloved husband to a wife who is expecting another child, a loving son, and the most loyal and supportive brother I could have ever asked for. 'His influence in the lives of all of us who loved him is immeasurable, and our grief is indescribable.' The station reported that fellow crewmember Michael Sheets, of Ypsilanti, was engaged, and was to get married later this year. In a statement to WDIV, Mr Sheets' family said: 'While there were inherent risks involved in his position, Michael assumed these risks to provide for his family. 'Michael was a loving and devoted son and brother.' The other Michigan men on board were pilot Jeremy Lipka of Brooklyn; first officer Jamie Brokaw of Monroe and Rinku Summan of Canton and maintenance crewman Gary Stockdale of Romulus. Crewman Timothy Garrett was from Louisville, Kentucky. It was revealed last night that Stockdale had predicted he would die in ball of flames, and believed that flying was a huge risk, his older brother said. Scroll down for video . Dashcam: The plane appears to be taking off normally at the beginning of the clip, gaining altitude shortly after takeoff from Bagram air base . Something's wrong: The plane, described as a cargo flight, then starts to twist and quickly . Violent crash: The cause of the 747 crash is still under investigation . Glenn Stockdale, 55, said: 'He always said it was dangerous,' NBC reported. 'He would always say, ""You either will die in a car crash or a ball of flame in a plane"".' A horrifying dashcam video captured the Boeing 747-400 appearing to take off normally as it gained altitude. But suddenly, the plane appears to stall, twisting and dropping rapidly before crashing to the ground in a fireball. In a statement, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the crash, but NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said there were no reports of insurgent activity in or around the base, which is one of the largest in the country and located about 25 miles north of Kabul. Crash: The Taliban claimed that it shot down the aircraft, a claim NATO denies . Fireball: The plane exploded as it crashed back to earth, sending flames shooting into the air . Casualties: All seven crewmembers aboard the cargo plane were killed in the crash . Explosion: The terrifying crash sent flames shooting into the sky . National Airlines president, Glen . Joerger, said in a statement: 'Safety is always our top priority at . National Airlines. This is a devastating loss for our family and we'll . work diligently with authorities to find the cause. 'Most importantly, our thoughts and prayers are with our crewmembers and their families.' The . Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation is . leading the investigation. The NTSB has also sent officials to assist in . the probe. The nation is mourning the loss of the seven brave servicemen. One of Brokaw's friends described him as a skilled navigator with significant flight experience. 'He was a very good person and very smart person,' Chris Connerton told The Associated Press Tuesday by telephone from Rochester, Minnesota. Tragedy: A giant plume of smoke can be seen just moments after the crash . Mourned: First Officer Jaime Brokaw, left, and load master Michael Sheets, both of Michigan, are two of the seven Americans killed when the private cargo plane went down in Afghanistan . Navigator: Rinku Summan was one of the two first officers on the flight. According to reports, the plane went down after the cargo load shifted on takeoff . Connerton credited Brokaw with helping . get him through flight school, as well as a harrowing flight two years . ago from Toledo, Ohio, to an international flight expo in Lakeland, . Florida, Connerton said ice had built up on the plane to the point that . he could no longer get it to climb. 'If it wasn't for Jamie's navigation . and know-how ... we wouldn't have made it,' Connerton said. 'I don't . know that I would have had the capacity to handle the situation on my . own.' Brokaw leaves behind a wife and young step-daughter. Gary Stockdale, 51, from Romulus, Michigan, was a member of the maintenance crew . Jeremy . Lipka's stepfather Dave Buttman said that his stepson had toured Iraq . and Afghanistan and escaped near-fatal incidents, but continued to serve . his country. He said: . 'Basically, you're taking your chances flying in there and he was just . happy to be one of the pilots to do it,' NBC reported. Hasler was a high school hockey star who lived in a tidy neighborhood in the suburbs outside Detroit. The . district governor for Bagram, Abdul Shukor, described the plane as . having reached an altitude of about 1,312 feet before suddenly 'falling . out of the sky,' he said, citing witness accounts. Coalition forces said that the official cause of the crash is under investigation, but it is believed that the plane's cargo - which included mostly military vehicles - moved as the flight took off, causing it to spin out of control. The Aviation Herald reported that the crew of the plane reported that a load shift caused the plane to stall moments before the crash. Bad weather is also being weighed as a possible cause. The crash came two days after four U.S. service members were killed when their surveillance aircraft in southern Afghanistan crashed due to adverse weather conditions.","Six crew members identified as Michigan residents - Jamie Brokaw, Rinku Summan, Gary Stockdale, Michael Sheets, Brad Hasler and Jeremy Lipka .

"Warren Gatland accepts that Wales need to 'get across the line' in their pursuit of a major rugby prize that has eluded them for six years. Not since November 2008 and the 11th game of head coach Gatland's current 82-Test reign have Wales floored a southern hemisphere heavyweight. On that occasion it was Saturday's opening autumn Test opponents Australia, beaten 21-18 just eight months after Wales were crowned RBS 6 Nations champions in Grand Slam fashion. Wales celebrate after beating Australia in November 2008 - their last win over southern hemisphere opposition . Five of nine subsequent defeats against the Wallabies have been by four points or less, while they twice lost by a point to South Africa during the same period. 'We are pretty aware we have been knocking on the door and put ourselves in situations - perhaps not against the All Blacks, but definitely against South Africa and Australia - on a number of occasions to win games,' Gatland said. 'We had a pretty honest debrief when we first came in (to prepare for the autumn series). 'We looked at the second Test in South Africa (Wales lost 31-10 in Nelspruit five months ago) and hopefully the things we can learn from, make sure that learning takes place and we are a bit more clinical when we get that opportunity again, if it does arise. Head coach Warren Gatland is desperate for Wales to break their southern hemisphere hoodoo . 'Once you do it the first time, it becomes easier the second and the third time. We have been knocking at the door, but we've got to get through it and get across the line and nail one of those victories.' This weekend's clash is given added emphasis by the fact that Wales and Australia will lock horns during next year's Rugby World Cup in a fearsome pool that also includes highly-fancied host nation England and often-dangerous Fiji. The Wallabies have arrived with a new coach - former Leinster supremo Michael Cheika - and found themselves dodging fall-out from Kurtley Beale's recent brush with Australian rugby authorities that earned the full-back a five-figure fine. 'A lot of people have been talking about what's happened with Kurtley Beale and those sort of things, and does that make them more vulnerable?' Gatland added. 'With Australians, it makes them stronger. Kurtley Beale (centre) has been omitted from the Australia squad for disciplinary reasons . 'They thrive on any adversity and any criticism, and we are expecting a really tough game on Saturday. 'I have got a massive amount of respect for what Michael (Cheika) has achieved. He is the only coach who has won a European Cup and a Super Rugby title. 'What he did with Leinster was incredibly impressive, and what he has done with New South Wales in terms of turning them around in a pretty short time. 'I think by his own admission it is going to take a little bit of time, but having watched him and seen him operate, it won't be that long. 'He plays a really positive brand of rugby, he gets his point across pretty succinctly and he is pretty honest with the players, and they appreciate that. 'In 10 months' time, when they turn up for the World Cup, I think they will be a real outfit to contend with.' Michael Cheika (left) has taken on the Australia job with a brilliant C.V. behind him . Starting on Saturday, Wales will play 12 Tests before their World Cup opener against Uruguay next September, and Gatland has made no attempt to hide the fact that rugby's global spectacular tops his agenda. 'We've really looked at the long-term plan in terms of this campaign, the Six Nations and the World Cup,' he said. 'We have run things a little differently in this campaign and we will in the Six Nations, almost like World Cup camps in terms of long-term preparation and planning. 'It is something I think we have been pretty bold and courageous to do. Our whole focus in the next 12 months has to be getting out of our group in the World Cup. That has to be our primary focus. Jamie Roberts (centre) trains at the Millennium Stadium ahead of Saturday's clash against Australia . 'Although we want to do exceptionally well in the autumn and in the Six Nations - and those are important games for us in making sure we perform well - the long-term objective is getting out of that group and making the (World Cup) quarter-finals.' Gatland, meanwhile, has confirmed that all of Wales' France-based players - Leigh Halfpenny, Jonathan Davies, Jamie Roberts, Mike Phillips and Luke Charteris - will be available for the autumn finale against South Africa on November 29. Lock Charteris has been released back to Racing Metro this week after a deal was done with the Paris-based Top 14 club that will see them reciprocate in terms of the Springboks clash.","Wales play Australia at Cardiff in their opening autumn international .

"Women could soon be able to buy their own version of Viagra. The pill, called Lybrido, is said to increase a woman’s desire for sex, and make it more satisfying when it happens. It uses a combination of testosterone and a Viagra-like drug, which work on both the brain and body to boost flagging libido. Libido: Previous attempts to make 'female viagra' have failed because women's low sex drive often stems from psychological factors . With trial results described as ‘very impressive’, it could be on bedside cabinets within three years. But experts warned that the firms which make it will be under pressure to prove that the drug will not turn women into nymphomaniacs. With worldwide sales of Viagra at nearly £1.5billion a year, scientists have long tried to create a version for the female market. But previous attempts have failed to make the grade, because low female libido often stems from psychological as much as physical factors. Dutch firm Emotional Brain believes it has cracked the problem with a two-in-one pill, which should be taken three and a half hours before sex. Smaller than an aspirin, it contains a Viagra-like drug in a testosterone and mint coating. Separately, neither drug can lift flagging female libido but, together, they are said to provide the necessary boost. Male version: Worldwide sales of Viagra at nearly £1.5billion a year, but there is not yet a female equivalent . The physical effect of Viagra magnifies the effect of testosterone on the brain’s pleasure centres. A trial involving more than 200 women in the US has just finished. The full results are still under wraps but Emotional Brain founder Adriaan Tuiten describes them as ‘very, very promising’. Dr Tuiten began researching female emotion after a girlfriend broke his heart when he was in his 20s. He said that with the drug, women made love more often and were more likely to reach orgasm. But some suffered side-effects including headaches and flushing of the face or neck. He now plans to carry out a larger trial, and hopes to put the drug on the market in Europe and the US at the end of 2016. Dr Tuiten believes the pills will be most popular with long-married women, for whom sex may have become a bore. But some doctors have warned the pills may be a little too much in demand. Dr Andrew Goldstein, a US expert in female sexual health, told the New York Times that drug companies such as Emotional Brain will be under pressure to prove they are not turning women into nymphomaniacs. Some experts fear Lybrido will put women under pressure to perform, while others are sceptical about whether the pills can boost female sex drive. They point out that a tablet is not going to fix a broken relationship or ease the stresses of work and childcare. Dr Tuiten says that up to 43 per cent of women suffer from a low sex drive at some point in their lives and that, far from turning women into sex maniacs, the drug will simply raise a low libido to normal levels. Dr Mike Wyllie, one of the team of scientists that discovered and developed the male impotence drug Viagra, described Lybrido as ‘an interesting concept’.","Lybrido, currently on trial, is a new drug created to arouse women .

"For decades, researchers have been trying in vain to decipher ancient texts written on the Voynich manuscript - yet they may have been looking for inspiration in the wrong place. A U.S. botanist studied illustrations of the plants throughout the 15th century book and pinpointed a number of them to the region now known as Mexico. Dr. Arthur Tucker claims at least 37 of the 303 plants would have grown in the region during the 15th and 16th century and believes the text is, therefore, written in the Aztec language of Nahuatl. Stephen Bax, Professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of Bedfordshire, say he has decoded words in it for the first time by identifying the plants . Nahuatl originated during the 7th century. It was the spoken predominantly by the Aztecs. Following the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, the alphabet was replaced with Latin. Nahuatl became a literary language, used in poetry and passages, similar to the Voynich manuscript. Varieties of Nahuatl are still spoken by approximately 1.5 million Nahua people in Central Mexico. The writing is so bizarre, sceptics have stated the book is a hoax or that the writing is nonsense. The Voynich manuscript was discovered in an Italian monastery in 1912 by book dealer Wilfred Voynich. Carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created between approximately 1404 and 1438, during the Italian Renaissance. The 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin, known as vellum, and are decorated with illustrations, diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right. Examples include the illustration of the Ipomoea murucoides, top left, taken from the Mexican Codex Cruz-Badianus which has an identical style to the Ipomoea arborescens in the manuscript, bottom left. A Voynich illustration of a cactus pad or fruit, right, is shown near the name ‘nashtli’, which Dr. Tucker and Talbert claim is a variant of the word ‘nochtil’ - the Nahuatl name for the fruit of the prickly pear . If the text, pictured far left, is written in the language of Nahuatl, the botanists claim they can find the name of the plants in the manuscript. From this, cryptographers may be able to form a basic code from which to crack the rest of the text in the 15th century book .

For example, Dr. Tucker and fellow researcher Rexford Talbert said one plant in the book bears a resemblance to the picture of a soap plant (xiuhamolli) seen in a Mexican codex from 1552. While another example includes the illustration of the Ipomoea murucoides, taken from the Mexican Codex Cruz-Badianus, which has an identical style to the Ipomoea arborescens in the manuscript.

The surgery was organized by Operation Smile, an international children’s medical charity that performs cleft lip and cleft palate surgery for children in low and middle income countries.

"These revealing images offer a glimpse at the full spectrum of life in reclusive North Korea, after leader Kim Jong-Un declared it to be a country on the brink of 'radical' change. The photographs capture a country of stark contrasts, with pictures ranging from fireworks exploding in the skies above Pyongyang during lavish New Year's Eve celebrations, to impoverished children hauling mounds of hay on their back at a farm in South Hwanghae province. The pictures - which were all taken by state photographers or western photographers under government supervision - also include shots taken on the day North Korea made headlines across the globe with the launch of its Unha-3 rocket in December. Lavish: Spectators snap pictures on their mobile phones as dazzling fireworks explode in the sky over Pyongyang as part of North Korea's New Year celebrations . In one 29-year-old leader Kim Jong-Un - who vowed to build the country into an economic 'giant' in a New Year's Day speech - is seen puffing on a cigarette at the country's General Satellite and Control Command Center following the launch of the rocket. North Korea has insisted the launch was carried out in order to put a satellite into space, but the move drew condemnation from many corners of the international community, with Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague among those to brand the rocket launch as 'provocative'. The young leader went on to hail the successful launch in a surprise New Year's Day address on state television, during which he outlined plans to boost the impoverished nation's economy through science and technology. Uncertain future: Farmer O Yong Ae at her home in Sariwon. Under proposed changes farmers at the helm of the country's collective farms would be able to keep a bigger share of their crops . Trapped: Two women appear to be praying inside a gated facility covered with barbed-wire . It has also been said that Kim Jong-Un is planning to allow the country's farmers to keep a larger share of their produce in a bid to boost the country's agricultural output, by giving poverty-stricken farmers an incentive to grow more food. Under existing rules farmers are required to turn over everything to the state beyond what they are allowed to keep to feed their families. The 29-year-old also pledged to boost North Korea's military power, an ambition that is evident in displays of might such as the mass rally held on the streets of the capital in the wake of the December rocket launch.

"Wembley chiefs have admitted they failed to lay the new Desso turf  properly before Sunday’s NFL game destroyed the playing surface. England head coach Roy Hodgson is furious the pitch will not be in perfect condition when Wayne Rooney wins his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday. Hodgson is attempting to introduce a slick passing game to the team as England coast through the rest of their Euro 2016 qualifying. Wembley chiefs admit they failed to lay the new Desso turf properly before Sunday’s NFL game . The Wembley surface is visibly cut up as the NFL stars go through their paces on Sunday night . The Cowboys beat the Jaguars 31-17 in the second NFL game at Wembley in a fortnight ahead of England . More rain is forecast this week as the Wembley groundstaff work night and day to repair the damage caused by Sunday’s mudbath when Dallas Cowboys played Jacksonville Jaguars. FA chiefs have since admitted the pitch will not be perfect on Saturday as they face Slovenia in front of 80,000 supporters. Wembley managing director Roger Maslin said: ‘I’m disappointed the surface isn’t as good as it should be but I’m confident it will be back to its pristine state after a winter renovation. ‘This isn’t so much a problem of the NFL but of our summer renovation. Due to slightly too much topsoil during the summer there’s more marking and scarring than we’d want. ‘Roy is entitled to his opinion. While the pitch will not be of the very highest standard we want for the Slovenia game, it will still be a good playing surface. We do expect it to be back to its best by March for the Lithuania game.’ One man hoping the pitch won’t stop him shining is England new boy Saido Berahino. The striker got a call up after seven goals for West Bromwich Albion and his club have told potential suitors that the 21-year-old is not for sale. With Tottenham and Liverpool both keen on a January move, chairman Jeremy Peace has issued a statement insisting Berahino will be at the club until at least next summer. Contract talks with Berahino’s representatives have begun, with the focus on improving a deal which currently runs to 2017 to reflect his growing importance. England manager Roy Hodgson was not at all pleased with the NFL match taking place at Wembley . It is believed he will be offered double his current £12,000-per-week salary, which was only signed last December. Before that, Berahino earned £850 per week. Peace issued a hands-off warning to would-be suitors. ‘I wish to assure our supporters that Saido Berahino will not be going anywhere in January or, I hope, next summer,’ he said. ‘It is not in our minds at all to trade a footballer the club has worked to develop. ‘It (Berahino’s form) seems to have also generated unwarranted speculation about his future — which I wish to stress remains very firmly aligned to this club.’ Saido Berahino was handed a call-up by Hodgson and the West Bromwich Albion striker has raised eyebrows . It is believed he will be offered double his current £12,000-per-week salary with an imminent new contract .","England manager Roy Hodgson is furious the pitch will not be perfect .

"The eerie hum of thousands of potentially deadly arrows pouring down on to the field of Agincourt is set to be recreated for the first time in six centuries. An ambitious project is underway to allow up to 1,000 archers to recreate Henry V’s celebrated victory in northern France. It was 598 years ago today – also a Friday – that the English king’s heavily outnumbered army defeated a French force close to the small town of Azincourt, as it is spelt in French. Relive: Up to 1,000 archers could set foot again on the battlefield of Agincourt to recreate the famous victory for Henry V . But the 600th anniversary of October 25th 1415 will be a far more significant one, with historians on both sides of the Channel already suggesting ways of commemorating it. The Agincourt Alliance, an Anglo-French re-enactment group supported by the town’s historical centre and local tourist agencies, is now proposing a ‘Big Shoot’. The Alliance’s website reads: ‘We want to recreate an arrow storm with at least 1,000 archers,’ adding: ‘We need a minimum 1,000 archer block to try and recreate Henry V's first arrow volley made in 1415. Each archer will need a minimum 30 suitably specified arrows.’ Brutality: Reenactors want to recreate the drama of the battle captured in this illustration of King Henry V and The Battle of Agincourt . Moment in history: There are a few reminders in Agincourt, pictured as it is today, that the fields around the village had been the scene of a pivotal battle between old foes England and France . Outnumbered but victorious: Exactly 598 years ago today, the English king's heavily outnumbered army defeated a French force near the small town of Agincourt . This means rubber blunted arrows fitted with long wooden shafts and fletched with real white feathers. The . Alliance adds: ‘This event will also give an opportunity to historians . and academics alike to confirm or review their opinions of this battle, . was the English archer as decisive as believed?’ When battle commenced at 11 a.m. on October 25, the English army was seemingly destined for annihilation. Numbering around 20,000, the French army was fresh, well-equipped and disciplined. Their opponents were depleted to about 5,000 men after two months of exhausting campaigning. But it has a secret weapon: their archers. The French were met by a furious . bombardment of artillery from the English archers, who wielded . innovative longbows with a range of 250 yards. French knights were totally unprepared to meet that weapon. Weighed down with heavy armour and become bogged down on the narrow and slightly upward sloping battlefield, they were a sitting target. As more knights entered the battle they became even more vulnerable to a cascade of deadly arrows. Almost 6,000 Frenchmen lost their lives during the Battle of Agincourt, while English deaths amounted to just over 400. The stunning victory turned the tide for the English during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) for control of the French throne. Henry V was eventually recognized in 1420 as heir to the French throne and the regent of France. But France would go on to eventually win the Hundred Years' War. A . trained archer could shoot six aimed arrows a minute which could wound . at 400 yards, kill at 200 and penetrate armour at 100 yards. While . Henry’s decisive victory in the 100 Years War has never been in . dispute, there have been numerous arguments about the manner in which it . was achieved. Some have . underplayed the effectiveness of the legendary English and Welsh bowmen . who took part, suggesting that more underhand tactics ensured a British . victory, which was immortalised by William Shakespeare’s play ‘Henry V’. In the past, the French have even accused their ‘perfidious’ foes of acting like war criminals by slaughtering hundreds of prisoners, many of them knights from noble Gallic families. The narrow field where the battle took place remains remarkably unchanged, and an archery range will be set up across its length. Marching troops dressed in the armour of the period will move towards the archers in what will undoubtedly be the most ambitious recreation of the battle ever attempted. The spectacular commemoration will come at a time when France and Belgium are preparing to mark the significant anniversaries of numerous great battles. These include Waterloo, which took place in 1815, and many of the great actions of World War I, which started in 1914. Recreations are particularly popular in France, where strict safety procedures are followed to try and stop anyone getting hurt. Cautionary advice on the Agincourt Alliance website reads: ‘All weapons must be blunted... Axes, maces and flails are not permitted on the battlefield during combat.’","Up to 1,000 enthusiasts set to recreate the battle of Agincourt .

"No longer number one: Barack Obama's America now has the second largest economy in the world . China has toppled America to become the biggest economy in the world, according to figures from the International Monetary Fund. The US has been the global leader since it overtook Britain in 1872, but has now lost its status as top dog. The latest IMF figures show the Chinese economy is worth £11trillion compared with £10.8trillion for the US. China – whose wealth has accelerated in recent decades amid rapid industrialisation – is expected to extend its lead, with the IMF estimating its economy will be worth £16.7trillion in 2019. That would be 20 per cent bigger than the US economy, which is forecast to be worth £13.8trillion by then. The numbers are based on ‘purchasing power parity’ (PPP) which makes adjustments for the fact that goods are cheaper in countries such as China relative to the US. Without these adjustments for living costs, the Chinese economy is still smaller than that of the US, at £6.4trillion. But experts have described the toppling of America after nearly 150 years by China – even on the PPP measure – as a ‘symbolic’ moment for the global economy. China enjoyed three decades of double-digit growth before the global downturn, as industrialisation and sweeping economic reforms created a new powerhouse in the East. Growth has slowed in recent years but remains strong by Western standards with the IMF forecasting expansion of 7.4 per cent this year and 7.1 per cent in 2015. By contrast, the IMF is predicting growth of just 2.2 per cent in the US this year and 3.1 per cent next year, while the UK is set for expansion of 3.2 per cent and 2.7 per cent. The Fund yesterday said the US and the UK ‘are approaching economic lift-off’ as they bounce back from the recession. But Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, warned that ‘potential growth is lower than it was in the early 2000s’ for much of the West, including the US and UK. Financial powerhouse: In the last decade alone, the skyline of major cities in China, such as Shanghai (pictured), have been completely transformed as the economy grew in leaps and bounds . Britain led the world in the industrial revolution of the mid-18th century, but America was hot on its heels. The US underwent huge industrial expansion after its civil war ended in 1865, fuelled by rapid urbanisation and huge population growth – including the immigration of nearly 30million Europeans. In 1872, its economy overtook Britain to become the world’s largest, a position it held for the next 142 years. Productivity, leading brands and innovation, coupled with the success of the US dollar and the fact that 62 per cent of the world’s financial reserves are held in the currency, kept America on top. Meanwhile, the economies of Britain and other European powers were ravaged by two world wars. Britain borrowed heavily from America during the Second World War and received a further $4.3billion in 1945. China was the world’s leading trading nation up to the 18th century, until control of its ports and trade were taken over by imperial nations in Europe. Under Communism it remained inward-looking, until 1980 when the government started to allow foreign investment. He added that China is ‘maintaining high growth’ which will slow in the coming years to a more ‘healthy’ level between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. Arvind Subramanian, senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute and an expert on China, recently highlighted the ‘symbolic’ importance of China overtaking the US. ‘China is very big and getting bigger,’ he said. ‘It’s not to be underestimated.’ The news that China is now the largest economy in the world is an embarrassment for Barack Obama and ends America’s 142 years at the top. Britain had out-produced the US and its European rivals for much of the 19th century, at the height of the industrial revolution and with trade links across the Empire. But the US caught up as a growing population, the expansion of the railways and a focus on industry as well as agriculture boosted its economy. China's wealth has accelerated in recent decades amid rapid industrialisation. Pictured, a car factory in Beijing . China has a population of around 1.3billion – four times that of the US – but its economy has only just become the biggest . The PPP measure of output makes India the third largest economy, followed by Japan in fourth and Germany in fifth. Russia, Brazil, France, Indonesia and the UK make up the rest of the top 10 in that order. Many economists believe the PPP measure of an economy is the fairest measure because it takes into account the cost of living in different countries. For example, although wages are typically far lower in less developed countries than in mature economies, goods and services are often also cheaper, which affects the comparative spending power of individuals. But critics argue it does not take into account how well off people actually are. China has a population of around 1.3billion – four times that of the US – but its economy has only just become the biggest. It means that individuals in America are typically far wealthier than they are in China and other emerging markets benefiting from a huge workforce and rapid growth.","Figures show the Chinese economy is worth £11trillion, the US £10.8trillion .

"This is the moment a warthog stepped into the path of a hungry lion and then became its prey. The incredible pictures show the warthog step into the lion's den, but it was only ever going to end one way, as the predator then leaps out with brute force to capture the animal. The lion then goes on to devour the wild pig, proving his status as top of the animal food chain. The unsuspecting warthog steps into the path of an oncoming lion at the Addo Elephant Park in South Africa . The lion leaps out on to the warthog with brute force and pounces on its prey . The warthog tries to make a break for freedom but the lion is hot on its heels trying to recapture it . The stunning images were taken by photographer Dr Trix Jonker, of Bloemfontein in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, who managed to capture the action . The stunning images were caught on camera by photographer Dr Trix Jonker, at the Addo Elephant Park in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Dr Jonker, 57, from Bloemfontein in the Free State province of South Africa, revealed she almost missed the moment as the warthog had a lucky escape first of all, but foolishly walked back into the lion's den and this time was not so lucky. But she managed to capture the action at the perfect minute. She said: 'It was getting late and the gates were closing in an hour. I looked away and when I looked back I saw the warthog coming straight towards some resting lions. The lion wrestles the warthog to the ground sending a dust cloud up in the air . Dr Jonker said when the dust cleared she saw the lion holding the warthog between his front paws . The warthog had a lucky escape the first time it entered the lion's den, but the second time it wasn't so lucky . 'The poor unsuspecting warthog did not spot the lions at all and she disappeared behind a bush where a lion was lying, and it was taken by surprise. Dr Jonker revealed the warthog first had a lucky escape after it accidentally woke a sleeping lioness and startled her so she didn't attack. But she couldn't believe her eyes when the same warthog went back into the lion's den. She added: After the warthog escaped, I thought the action was over. But the warthog went back in a circle and went back on the same path as before, straight back into the lions. The lion asserts his authority as top of the food chain as he takes a bite of  the warthog who was unable to escape . The lion digs his teeth into the warthog he has just killed as he is joined by a lioness . 'By this time, a male lion had woken up and was sat up straight trying to see what the commotion was. 'He saw the warthog coming and went straight into the attack position. This was when I had my camera poised as I knew this time something was going to happen. 'At one stage there was only this big dust cloud and I could not see what was happening. The pictures were captured by Dr Trix Jonker, pictured, who said it was amazing she managed to capture the battle on camera . 'Then when the dust cleared and I saw the lion holding the warthog between his front paws and looking straight at me. 'He stayed like that for quite a while then lifted the warthog into the air and started dragging her away. 'I couldn't believe how tough the warthog was, and was absolutely stunned by what I saw that afternoon. It's amazing I managed to capture it on camera.'","Incredible pictures show the moment a unsuspecting warthog walked into the path of a hungry lion .

"Wayne Rooney is poised to join an elite band of English footballers when he lines up for the Three Lions in Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier with Slovenia. Just eight other players in England 142-year history have reached a century of caps - Peter Shilton, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Bobby Moore, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Bobby Charlton and Billy Wright - and it's only fitting to mark the landmark properly. That's why Rooney returned to his old primary school, Our Lady and St Swithin’s Catholic Primary School in Liverpool, for an exclusive Sportsmail photoshoot.

Inspiration for the photoshoot came from two previous occasions on which England legends have reached their century. Back in 1973, Moore posed with 99 boys from St Edward's Roman Catholic school opposite West Ham's Upton Park ground on the eve of his 100th England appearance. Each of the pupils wore a cap, some borrowed because Moore had not been awarded one for every game.

"Kim Jong-un is putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, it has been claimed. The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite  Western sanctions. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so in recent months that he now walks with a limp. Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state with the title Eternal President of the Republic. Scroll down for video . Weight gain: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un got a taste for the cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions . Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat. Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s. But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror. North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung. He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s. Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. 'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.' Inspiration: Experts believe Kim Jong-un may be using his love of Emmental (left) to deliberately gain weight in order to look more like his corpulent grandfather late Kim Il-sung (right) North Korea is not accepting American offers to send a high-level envoy to seek the release of three detained Americans, it has been claimed. Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, said freeing the detainees could provide a diplomatic opening between the nations, also snared by Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons. But he said Washington would not give into attempts to 'extort' political gain from the detentions. North Korea this week sentenced 24-year-old Matthew Miller of Bakersfield, California, to six years hard labor, deepening U.S. concern over the cases. Miller, who according to the court tore up his visa on arrival in Pyongyang in April, was convicted of entering the country illegally to commit espionage. Another trial is expected soon for Jeffrey Fowle, of Miamisburg, Ohio, who was arrested in May for leaving a Bible at a sailor's club. Earlier this year it was revealed that Kim tried to send a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production. Tired of his country's bland attempts to produce a top quality local cheese the despot ordered the three specialists to spend several months at the National Dairy Industry College. Although the college 'politely but firmly' rejected the request, Kim remains determined to improve standards at the country's main cheese factory. He is understood to be furious that the Pyongyang Dairy has continually failed to produce an Emmental-style cheese of a high enough quality to satisfy his demands. The news comes as North Korea branded the U.S. 'a graveyard of human rights', criticising the nation in the wake of the Missouri riots following the shooting of an unarmed black teenager. China, Iran and Russia have previously criticised America following the shooting and the crackdown on protesters following the shooting in the town of Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis. North Korea, which is regularly condemned by Washington  over allegations of human rights abuses, has now added its voice to those highlighting America's flaws, saying it should 'mind its own business' rather than interfering in the other countries' internal affairs.","Kim Jong-un's health said to be at risk due to his high cheese consumption .

"If the late Michael Winner knew about this, he'd be telling pop singer Robbie Williams to 'calm down, dear'. The 39-year-old star has splashed out £17.5million on Winner's former home, a 46-room mansion in west London's upmarket Holland Park. It was sold despite Winner, the larger-than-life film director, having believed Woodland House was worth at least three times that price. Father-of-one Williams, who has been living Los Angeles with his wife Ayda, is said to have been searching for a home for his family for more than a year. Robbie Williams and his wife Ayda are buying Michael Winner's former home in Holland Park for £17.5million . The opulent home of the late Michael Winner and his wife .

Wrong number: Michael Winner had previously put the house on the market . for £60million, but nine months after his death it went on sale for . £17.5million . Extravagance: The house was initially three flats, but Michael Winner converted it into a mansion . He wants his newborn daughter Theodora Rose to have a British passport and education, The Sunday Times reported today. The . couple already own an £8million seven-bedroom mansion in Wiltshire, but . are believed to want their child, affectionately named 'Teddy', to grow . up in London. But Williams may want to be careful about playing his particular brand of pop music out loud in his new pad - his immediate neighbour is music legend Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin. Following his death at the house in January, it emerged that . on top of substantial debts, Winner had taken out several mortgages . against Woodland House to secure flats for his former girlfriends. Winner shared the home with wife . Geraldine - and several girlfriends before her - and tried to sell it in 2011 for £60million. His father bought the leasehold property - which only has 31 years left on the agreement - in 1946 for just £2,000 and Winner, who spent millions reinstating the building to its former grandeur, was brought up there.

No-holds-barred: Michael Winner took over the flats from his father in 1978 and spent millions on the conversion, building a swimming pool, cinema and extensive gardens . Staying British: According to his wife Geraldine it was the wish of Winner, who died in January this year, that the flat be sold to a British family who would not cut it up into flats . Little palace: Winner would hold extravagant parties at Woodland House, a large part of which he had decorated himself . The . house sits on the bend of a leafy crescent in Kensington and was built . in the Queen Anne style by Richard Norman Shaw for a Victorian artist . called Sir Luke Fildes. The . house was originally three flats, which were bought by Winner's . property magnate father, George, and it remains leasehold. The . freeholder is Charlotte Townsend, one of Britain's richest women. Winner . took possession of the house in 1978 when it was still flats and spent . millions creating an opulent home, complete with swimming pool, cinema . and extensive gardens, which he loved. Despite . making the Victorian marvel a regular feature in celebrity and . architectural magazines down the years, Winner was looking to sell the . house in his later years. Attempting a sale in 2011, Winner set the price at £60million, despite protests from the estate agent.

"Not so long ago she was wiggling her way around the clubs of Sunderland as an unknown burlesque dancer. Then, in a dramatic twist of fate, in 2011 Katrina Darling discovered she was a distant cousin of one of the most famous women in the world: the Duchess of Cambridge. Since her discovery, the stripper has pocketed herself six-figure sums posing for a variety of raunchy magazines - including Playboy - and performing her risque burlesque act across the globe. Now, her latest magazine shoot, which shows her posing in barely there underwear, proves that she may be related to the future Queen of England - but her behaviour couldn't be further apart. Royal connections: Katrina Darling, the Duchess of Cambridge's second cousin once removed, bared all in her interview with Loaded magazine . Kate's racy 22-year-old relative has shaken off the shackles of regal decorum in her scantily clad shoot for Loaded magazine. Miss Darling, who was revealed ahead of the Royal Wedding to be Kate's second cousin, once removed, poses naked with peroxide blonde hair for the new issue of men's magazine Loaded. And the stripper even lets rip at Kate's new family in a sensational interview. Baring all: The 22-year-old stripper didn't hold back in the interview and proved how comfortable she was in her own skin by posing in next to nothing . Speaking about her cousin's father-in-law, the outspoken bombshell said: 'I think Prince Charles has done a lot of good for people. It’s his prerogative who he dates. 'Some men are like that. you can’t polish a turd.' And she didn't stop at Prince Charles. Miss Darling also added that she isn't attracted to loveable ginger Prince Harry and wouldn't want to see his 'tackle,' as she ever so gracefully puts it. But if there is one person the tattooed former Barclays bank employee has some sympathy for her cousin Kate, particularly following the publication of her private holiday photographs. A born performer: Katrina began learning burlesque dancing at a young age and performed for the first time topless at age eighteen . She told the magazine: 'She was on private land and comfortable being . in her own skin. 'I don't think she should be scrutinised for being . comfortable in her own skin.' Katrina, who hails from the North East, certainly has no hang-ups of her own in that regard. She explains that she has always been comfortable with her own body - something that led her to learning the art of burlesque. Indeed, so comfortable was she that she even performed topless at the tender age of 18 in front of her family. Sympathy: The stripper has sympathy with her cousin Kate, especially after private photographs of her in holiday surfaced . 'I don't feel undressed when I'm not . wearing clothes. I feel very comfortable,' she added. Miss Darling, who has never made any attempt to contact the Middletons, previously insisted that she had been a burlesque dancer for years and the recent success and attention is just a happy coincidence.

"Filipe Luis, a player so desperate to force his Chelsea move through that he was banished to train with the Atletico Madrid reserves, got his wish on Friday. The 28-year-old became Chelsea's fourth signing of the summer - the second from Atletico - and is designed to replace the departed Ashley Cole. Luis doesn't make the top 10 most expensive signings of the summer. He isn't even the most expensive left back, nor is he Chelsea's priciest purchase, yet there can be few as shrewd.

KEY STATS FROM LAST LA LIGA SEASON . 26 - goals conceded in 32 games . 131 - tackles made . 49 - interceptions made . 80.3 - per cent pass completion rate . 1048 - passes completed out of 1305 . Luke Shaw, Manchester United's new left back, cost almost twice as much as Luis. That brought up questions: Is an 18-year-old worth £31.5m? Is Shaw ready for that responsibility? Will he bow to the pressure of high expectations? Shaw, who turned 19 last week, has plenty to prove under Louis van Gaal. Luis, on the other hand, can be considered a safer bet by Jose Mourinho. The Brazilian's stock has risen over time, and that comes as a result of proving himself in Europe. Luis made 32 appearances in a defence that conceded just 26 goals last year to guide Atletico to their first La Liga title in 18 years. He kept a pass completion rate of 80.3 per cent, made 131 tackles and intercepted 49 times. Before all that, though, Luis joined Deportivo for a modest £1.7m. That time in Spain was what piqued Atletico's interest who, in 2010, paid £11.3m to bring him to the Vicente Calderon. There have been downsides, though. He failed to win the Champions League last year, losing 4-1 in extra time to rivals Real, and was overlooked by Luiz Felipe Scolari for Brazil's World Cup squad. Nevertheless, one of those remains a wrong Luis feels he can put right: 'I want to go one better in the Champions League and, in terms of the Premier League, I want the trophy badly.' Luis has allowed the No 3 shirt - his regular at Atletico - to remain vacant, too. That is in tribute to his predecessor, Cole, who joined Roma after an eight-year stint at Chelsea.

'I'm going to give my best in all the games. You are never going to see Filipe walking on the field, always running. 'I will give my best and give a lot of work and effort. I hope we can bring trophies to the fans and they are going to be very happy with everybody.' Only time will tell if it is as shrewd a bit of business as it looks by Mourinho when Chelsea's season gets going against Burnley on August 18.","Filipe Luis signs for Chelsea after Atletico Madrid accept £16million fee .

"No remorse: Serial Killer Rose West who is serving a life term at Low Newton prison in Durham . Rosemary West is so happy in prison she wants to die there, the Mail can reveal. Days ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Cromwell Street House of Horrors case, a close associate of the 60-year-old serial killer says she has no interest in fighting her ‘life means life’ sentence because she enjoys living behind bars. West, who was convicted of a total of ten murders in 1995, lives in a top-security prison at a cost of £50,000 a year to the taxpayer. There the psychopath enjoys listening to The Archers on Radio 4, playing Monopoly, embroidery, cooking and shopping from catalogues. According to well-placed sources, she also loves beauty products from Avon and trinkets from Argos, which she has delivered. Her ‘cell’ at top security Low Newton jail in Durham features a TV, radio, CD player and her own bathroom. Sex-obsessed West, whose husband killed himself shortly before he was due to stand trial alongside her for 12 murders, has also had a series of lesbian affairs behind bars. She reportedly earns £16 a week as an orderly after being promoted from a cleaner. One of her duties is said to include making tea for the warders. Her fondness for her life in jail makes a mockery of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, rejected this week by the Court of Appeal, that whole-life tariffs are unlawful. And it will infuriate relatives of the nine girls and young women who were raped, tortured and murdered by West, with her equally depraved husband Fred, and buried at their terraced home in Gloucester. After Rose was convicted, some of the victims’ families complained that the murderess would never have to worry about food, heating and accommodation bills in prison. Next Wednesday, it will be exactly 20 years since police discovered the remains of the Wests’ missing 16-year-old daughter Heather – and another human thigh bone – buried in the back garden at 25 Cromwell Street. Heather, who disappeared in 1987, was the first of nine girls and young women whose remains were found at the Wests’ home.

A further three victims were found buried elsewhere, including Fred’s eight-year-old stepdaughter Charmaine who was murdered by Rose at a previous address in 1971, while he was in prison. Despite the overwhelming prosecution evidence at her trial, Rose has always denied being a killer. The Mail can also reveal that West’s own lawyer has urged her to come clean about what happened and where other victims may have been buried. Not only has she refused, she has snubbed a letter of forgiveness from one of her victim’s relatives. Marian Partington, whose university student sister Lucy, 21, was abducted and murdered by the Wests in 1973, revealed two years ago that after much soul-searching she had written to West in prison and offered her forgiveness. The details are contained in her book, If You Sit Very Still, published in 2012. In the letter, which she wrote in 2004 but waited four years to post, she told West: ‘I do not feel any hostility towards you, just a sadness, a deep sadness, that all this has happened, and that your heart could not feel a truth that I wish you could know.’ Smiling: West was seen laughing as she was led out of Gloucester Magistrates' Court . A few weeks later, she received a letter written on behalf of West from prison, pointedly not accepting her forgiveness and asking Ms Partington to ‘cease all correspondence’. The Mail has learned that in 2001, West contacted a member of her legal team, who was submitting a new application on her behalf to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, to say she never wanted to come out of jail. A source said: ‘She made it clear she was happy in prison and wanted to make her life there. She said she didn’t want to appeal against her convictions but she didn’t admit to killing anyone.’ West’s former lawyer Leo Goatley declined to comment on why she had dropped her appeal. But he urged her, for the sake of the victims, to reveal exactly what had happened at Cromwell Street. He said: ‘It was never established in the investigation what fate precisely fell on the victims. ‘We know they were murdered, dismembered and buried. But there is that void at the centre of the case. People involved in the case could move on if [the facts] could be established.’ Mr Goatley said there is ‘strong evidence’ that schoolgirl Mary Bastholm, 15, who disappeared in 1968, was one of Fred’s early victims. Mary’s brother Peter Bastholm said he has considered making an appeal to West to finally tell the whole truth. ‘But Rose hasn’t an ounce of compassion, humanity or goodness in her body,’ he said. ‘Rehabilitation and remorse don’t apply to prisoners like her.’ Fred West escaped justice by asphyxiating himself in Winson Green prison, in Birmingham, on New Year’s Day 1995.","60-year-old killer has no interest in fighting 'life means life' sentence .

"Baroness Margaret Thatcher appears to have been well-liked across the pond, as many American politicians have reflected on their respect of the now-deceased British leader. Among her admirers is former First Lady Nancy Reagan, the widow of President Ronald Reagan - who worked closely with the so-called Iron Lady. Reagan and Thatcher joined forces in the early 1980s and drastically changed the economic and political landscapes in both of their countries. Scroll down for video . 'Special relationship': Former First Lady Nancy Reagan (seen here in 1991) said she was too frail to attend Mrs Thatcher's funeral but she mourned her loss . Their calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. And their side-by-side standing up to . Soviet communism is credited by those of all political stripes as . hastening the end of the Cold War. Dynamic duo: Reagan and Thatcher's calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic . Speaking to MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell yesterday, Mrs Reagan said that it wasn't just her husband who got along well with Mrs Thatcher, but she did as well. 'We had a very special relationship,' Mrs Reagan said via phone. 'I think people thought she and I didn't have a relationship. Nothing could be farther from the truth. And of course I loved it that she and Ronnie were as close as they were.' Also singing Thatcher's praises was President Barack Obama, who said that America 'has lost a true friend.' The kind words came amid the revelation that Thatcher died in the luxury suite at the Ritz where she had spent months recuperating after an operation. Britain's first and only female prime minister, who passed away peacefully at the age of 87 after suffering a massive stroke, had checked into the five star hotel at the start of the year following minor surgery on her bladder over Christmas. While a close-knit circle of friends . took it in turns to visit the increasingly frail 87-year-old at the . Belgravia hotel - a long-time favorite of the former leader's - it was a . solitary start to what would prove to be her final few months. She had been due to spend Christmas Day . with her niece Jane Mays, who lives in north east London, but was . admitted to hospital five days earlier for minor surgery to remove a . growth on her bladder. Iron Lady: Baroness Thatcher, who died today, was pictured on a bench in Battersea Park, London with her carers and a police officer . Ritz: Media and police were gathered outside the five star Ritz Hotel in London today, where Baroness Thatcher died after suffering a massive stroke . Her daughter Carol Thatcher, 59, was understood to be at her side in the hospital at Christmas time. After being discharged Baroness Thatcher was checked straight into a suite at the hotel in Belgravia amid concerns she would no longer be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four-story mansion. Staff at the hotel had invited her to make the Ritz her home for the foreseeable future, and her carers are understood to have been taking it in turns to stay with the 87-year-old. Yesterday Carol dashed home from Swiss ski resort Klosters, where she lives for part of the year, to be with her ailing mother, her neighbours said. The mother of two, who was Britain's . first and only female prime minister, had spent the previous two . Christmases without either Carol or her twin brother Sir Mark. Close . friends of the former prime minister said after she was discharged that . she was in 'sparkling form' following the procedure, but admitted the . experience had been 'very draining' for her. Home life: The former prime minister had spent recent Christmases without her children Carol (pictured with her mother) and Mark . The spell in hospital followed more than a decade of fragile health for Baroness Thatcher after she suffered a series of minor strokes in 2002. She had been suffering from acute short-term memory loss, which could make social gatherings an unsettling experience, and in recent years the once formidable Iron Lady had all but disappeared from public view. Alongside her health issues, in 2003 Baroness Thatcher suffered the devastating loss of her husband Denis, 88, who she had described as the 'golden thread running through my life.' The life-altering loss heralded the . start of a new chapter in her life, one in which she appeared to spend . increasing periods of time without her close family around her. Loved ones: Family was said to be essential in the life of Baroness Thatcher, who was mother to Carol, left, who rushed home from a ski trip in Klosters, Switzerland, yesterday, and Sir Mark, right . 'Golden thread': Baroness Thatcher's husband Denis died in 2003 at the age of 88 after suffering heart problems and pancreatic cancer . Although she was a mother of two, it was . with Mrs Mayes - the daughter of Baroness Thatcher's late older sister . Muriel - that she had been due to spend last Christmas before she fell . ill. She dined with Mrs Mayes and her family on Christmas Day 2011, while both Carol and Mark spent the festive season abroad. The former prime minister had credited her husband, who was 10 years her senior, as the man 'who has made everything possible.' Honoured: Baroness Thatcher will receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours, Downing Street has said . She met her husband while fighting the Dartford constituency - which she lost - in 1950. Denis, the director of a paint firm, helped the fledgeling politician by driving her around. They married in the autumn of 1951 when Baroness Thatcher was 26. As she went on to embark upon a career at the highest echelons of British politics, she relied on Denis as a constant source of discreet support. The pair had enjoyed an marriage lasting more than 50 years, but Baroness Thatcher's family life was not without moments of crisis. Some months after the death of her . husband she endured a second personal trauma when their son, Sir Mark, . was charged in August 2004 with plotting a coup to overthrow the . Government of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea - a charge which could, in its . extreme, have led to the death penalty. Baroness Thatcher, already suffering ill health, was deeply upset by the news about her son, to whom she was devoted. To her intense relief, he entered a guilty plea and was punished with a large fine and a suspended prison sentence. Baroness Thatcher was well enough to . celebrate her 87th birthday with Sir Mark, 59, and his wife at a London . restaurant last October. She had also enjoyed robust health during her term as Prime Minister. Unlike . her predecessor at 10 Downing Street, James Callaghan, Mrs Thatcher did . not have a doctor accompanying her on foreign trips. Days gone by: The then Conservative Party leader is seen strolling through the grounds of Scotney Castle in Kent with husband Denis and their twins Mark and Carol in 1979 . Upsetting: Sir Mark is seen outside the High Court in Cape Town in 2004, after pleading guilty to charges of plotting a coup to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea . Once, when she was asked by Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister of Singapore, why she did not travel with a doctor, she replied: 'I would have ended up looking after the doctor'. But in the past decade, she had become increasing frail. In 2002, she made her first concession to increasing age when she cut back her workload on the advice of doctors. Concern about her health had been growing and it emerged she had suffered a minor stroke shortly before New Year 2002 during her golden wedding anniversary holiday with Sir Denis Thatcher in Madeira. The series of minor strokes forced her to retire from public speaking. Despite this, in May 2004 - the 25th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister - she defied doctors' orders to speak at a dinner held in her honour, attacking the Blair Government and praising Michael Howard, then Tory leader. In 2008, Lady Thatcher succumbed to the heat at a dinner in the House of Lords and fainted. She was taken to nearby St Thomas's Hospital for tests, but was allowed to go home the following day. Recuperation: Baroness Thatcher started the year convalescing at the Ritz in central London after undergoing minor surgery over Christmas . Tributes: Notes and bouquets were piling up outside the former prime minister's home in London following the news of her death today . That year her daughter Carol admitted that her mother suffered from dementia. She said she first noticed her mother's previously formidable memory was failing in 2000 and she had to be repeatedly . reminded about the death of her husband, each time reacting to the sad . news as if it were the first time she had heard it. Baroness Thatcher died after . suffering from a stroke - a condition which kills around 45,000 people . every year in the UK - and is the third largest cause of death, after . heart disease and cancer. The risk of stroke rises . significantly with age. And 40,000 of those who die each year are over . the age of 75, according to the Stroke Association. Although men have a higher risk of stroke, women are one and a half times as likely to die from one.","Nancy Reagan speaks of her close bond with Baroness Thatcher hours after her death had been announced .

"Travis VanderZanden has been accused of stealing trade secrets from rideshare company Lyft . The former chief operating officer of Lyft is being sued by the rideshare company for allegedly stealing more than 1,400 sensitive documents before joining arch rival Uber. Travis VanderZanden has been accused of uploading the files to his personal Dropbox account before leaving Lyft in August. Weeks later, he joined competitor Uber as vice president of international growth. Lyft claims some of the documents contained extremely confidential information, including the company's strategic plan for 2014, financial plans through 2016, growth data and international expansion plans. The complaint, filed in San Francisco yesterday, alleges Mr VanderZanden  has used the confidential data in his current employment with Uber, Bloomberg reports. 'We are disappointed to have to take this step, but this unusual situation has left us no choice but to take the necessary legal action to protect our confidential information,' Lyft said. 'We are incredibly proud of the dedicated and people-powered culture that we've fostered to support drivers, passengers and the entire Lyft community and we will not tolerate this type of behavior.' According to the complaint, Uber's lawyers told Lyft that Mr VanderZanden 'has no Lyft proprietary information in his possession, not now, not when he started at Uber, and not since he left Lyft'. It is thought Mr VanderZanden left Lyft after falling out with its co-founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, over how the company was being run. Lyft, whose drivers sport distinctive pink moustaches on their cars, is seeking to have the confidential documents returned and destroyed from Mr VanderZanden’s personal computer or any other devices he might be able to use to access it. In addition, the company has accused Mr VanderZanden of soliciting Lyft employees to leave Lyft and to join Uber, including vice president of operations Stephen Schnell and fellow employee Ryan Fujiu. Mr VanderZanden quit Lyft, whose drivers sport iconic pink mustaches on their cars, last August reportedly over differences with the company founders about how the company should be run . Both Uber and Lyft use special apps to connect passengers who are their customers with drivers of vehicles for hire. The two San Francisco-based companies have battled in the taxi market since Lyft came onto the scene in 2012, three years after Uber. Their rivalry has been dogged with allegations of backstabbing, spying, turf wars and driver-poaching. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick openly acknowledged he tried to disrupt Lyft's funding efforts. He told the magazine: 'We knew that Lyft was going to raise a ton of money and we were going [to their investors saying], 'Just so you know, we're going to be fundraising after this, so before you decide whether you want to invest in them, just make sure you know that we are going to be fund-raising immediately after.'

"The current England international week being the last for four months will sharpen minds at the FA over if and when to extend manager Roy Hodgson’s contract which runs until 2016. Only a few months ago there was significant criticism of the FA for giving Hodgson a deal until Euro 2016 in France, ahead of what turned out to be a dismal England showing at the World Cup. Yet such is the speed at which the football calendar turns that the draw for the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition takes place in St Petersburg next July. Roy Hodgson's contract as England manager runs out in 2016 after the European Championship . The decision to keep Hodgson on came after a poor showing at the World Cup in Brazil in the summer . And it is always an uncomfortable situation when an England manager has to give his views on fixtures when he might no longer be in charge of the team — as happened with both Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson. There are those on the FA board who believe the England manager should be judged from tournament to tournament with no need for the long-term contracts, such as the bewildering six-year agreement the RFU have given head coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup on home soil. But by the time the FA delegation arrives in Russia next summer, England might have already secured their place in the Euros and with no obvious successor — especially with Brendan Rodgers’ stock falling — the FA could easily award Hodgson two more years. The FA say they have yet to decide who will go to St Petersburg and have no intention of talking about Hodgson’s contract. Hodgson's side face Slovenia and then Scotland at the weekend, and then have a four-month break . Brendan Rodgers (right) is one of few possible candidates to replace Hodgson as England boss . The FA, who take birthday celebrations very seriously, have already started planning for the 50th anniversary of the World Cup win in 2016. But the great difficulty for the FA will be avoiding the landmark developing into another inquest of why there has been no repeat during 50 years of hurt. The initial thought is to focus on the whole tournament, including North Korea’s involvement, rather than just England’s isolated victory. The FA have already started planning for the 50th anniversary of the World Cup win in 2016 . David Bernstein, former FA chairman who would have always travelled at the front of the plane with the England team, was spotted back in the economy seats on a European flight last week. Bernstein, who had been desperate to carry on at the FA past the limit of his 70th birthday, is now chairman of the Red Cross board of trustees and admirably didn’t want to waste his charity’s funds on business-class travel. Alf Ramsey steps in to stop the English player George Cohen (right) swapping his shirt with the Argentines . Meanwhile, the football memorabilia lots including Ray Wilson and Jimmy Greaves’s World Cup winning medals being auctioned on Tuesday were close to having Bobby Charlton’s shirt from the 1966 World Cup quarter-final which he swapped with Argentinian Silvio Marzolini despite manager Sir Alf Ramsey calling the opposition ‘animals’. But agents acting for Marzolini, who previously loaned his prize possession to the Old Trafford museum, could not agree a price. Twickenham's botched planning for the autumn international series was not limited to decimating the West Car park for commercial gain. The new ticket scanners were so unreliable that large queues formed outside and a considerable number of fans missed the Haka and anthems until gates were opened to allow them in manually. The RFU said the glitches will be sorted out before the South Africa game. The ticketing system at Twickenham for England's clash with New Zealand had a few problems . No World Cup for Brian . BBC Radio 5 Live are expected to win main UK radio rights for the Rugby World Cup after protracted talks, that have gone on for over a year with the International Rugby Board. That will be a relief for those who had to put up with the unintelligible Brian Moore as chief pundit on talkSPORT in New Zealand in 2011. His station are likely to receive the secondary news update rights package. Meanwhile, World Cup broadcasters ITV, who have loaned Sky Sports rugby talent in the past, are now reportedly more impressed with the way BT cover the sport.

"Manchester United have finally received some positive injury news after Marouane Fellaini returned to full training and Ander Herrera expressed his determination to be back in action within a fortnight. Fellaini and Herrera are among 10 United players who have been sidelined through injury since the beginning of the season, severely hindering the start of Louis van Gaal’s Old Trafford reign. The Belgium midfielder has been sidelined for the last five weeks since suffering ligament damage in his left ankle in training after playing in the opening game against Swansea. Marouane Fellaini has returned to full training after recovering from an ankle injury . The £27.5million signing from Everton has resumed training with the first-team squad at Carrington this week although it appears unlikely that he will be ready to face his old club at Old Trafford on Sunday. Fellaini predicted that he would be back at the end of September when he spoke last week about his determination to make a success of his move to United. ‘I have known difficult moments like last season, but you become a stronger player afterwards,’ said the Belgian. ‘I have confidence in myself and in my game again. New signing Ander Herrera is determined to recover from his rib injury within a fortnight . Ander Herrera picked up his rib injury during Manchester United's win over West Ham . ‘I played a good World Cup and I was also good during pre-season. It is unfortunate that this injury has thrown a spanner in the works, but at the end of the month I will be back.’ Herrera fractured a rib in his back in Saturday’s win over West Ham and was expected to be out of action for up to a month. United’s £29m summer signing from Athletic Bilbao is believed to have caught a knee in the back from an opponent in the first half and played on until the 74th minute. The club offered him the opportunity to have a break while he recovers, but Herrera has made it clear that he can be fit to play again in two weeks after the forthcoming international break. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has had to deal with a growing list of injuries so far this season . Darren Fletcher is set to replace Herrera against Everton while Juan Mata is expected to be recalled in place of the suspended Wayne Rooney. There was more promising news from Van Gaal  as it emerged that Michael Carrick and Phil Jones are running outside again, although they are not ready to rejoin the main first-team group. Carrick has yet to play this season after undergoing ankle surgery in July and Jones suffered a hamstring strain in England’s win over Switzerland three weeks ago.","Marouane Fellaini back in full training after ankle injury .

"A new billboard campaign featuring images of pregnant boys has been launched in Chicago with the intended aim of reducing teen pregnancy rates in the city. The Chicago Department of Public Health has said it choose the unusual images because it wanted to impress upon young males that teen pregnancy is not just the girl's responsibility. The ad campaign has been rolled out this week in the city and suburbs, on transit buses, trains and billboards. A new billboard campaign featuring images of pregnant boys has been launched in Chicago with the intended aim of reducing teen pregnancy rates in the city . The ad campaign has been rolled out this week in Chicago and suburbs, on transit buses, trains and billboards . They have been placed close to local high schools where the teen pregnancy rate has recently increased, reports MyFoxChicago. A similar campaign ran in Milwaukee last year and has been credited with helping to reduce teen pregnancy rates there. Earlier this year a new teen pregnancy prevention ad from New York's Human Resources Administration (HRA) came under attack for using 'slut-shaming' insults to deter unwanted pregnancy. The campaign, which launched on March 3 in bus shelters and subway stations, featured pictures of toddlers next to messages that read: 'Honestly, Mom… Chances are he . won’t stay with you' and 'I’m twice as likely not . to graduate high school because you had me as a teen.' A similar campaign ran in Milwaukee last year and has been credited with helping to reduce teen pregnancy rates . Those ads were accused of using threats and ridicule to 'promote . the difficulties of teen pregnancy,' instead of offering assistance and eduction to address what the HRA calls 'the real costs of teen pregnancy for teens and their children.' New York City's Planned Parenthood denounced the ads, saying they are not the answer. Haydee Morales, Vice . President of Education and Training explained: 'The latest NYC ad campaign creates stigma, hostility, and negative . public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering . alternative aspirations for young people. 'The City’s money would be better spent helping teens access . health care, birth control, and high-quality sexual and reproductive . health education, not on an ad campaign intended to create shock value' An interactive component to the campaign also offered young people the choice to 'Text ""NOTNOW"" to 877877 for the real cost of teen pregnancy.' Helpful or harmful? A new Teen Pregnancy Prevention ad campaign from New York's Human Resources Administration has come under attack for using 'slut-shaming' insults to deter unwanted pregnancy . Once teens texted the number, they are faced with 'sobering facts about teen pregnancy,' according to the campaign's press release. Different scenarios depicted how a teen mother would gain an excessive amount of weight, be ignored by the child's father, and shunned by her parents. However the texts offer no information on how to avoid a pregnancy. 'The ad creates stigma, hostility, and negative . public opinions... rather than offering . alternative aspirations for young people' One text message received by MailOnline . came from a hypothetical 16-year-old teen named Anaya, who wrote: 'OMG! My BF Louis and I got pregnant. He was going to take me to prom, now I . will look huge in my dress. Should I go?' After responding 'yes,' Anaya replied: 'My BFF called me a ""fat loser"" at prom. I was devastated.' A later message added: 'Ugh, now I have morning sickness during an exam! Should I throw up or finish the test?' The ads were accused of being judgmental and problematic, resulting in emotional anxiety and stress, rather than creating a productive discourse surrounding teen pregnancy. Jezebel's Laura Beck called the campaign a 'shortsighted outreach' that will 'create a deeper chasm between the people who want . assistance, and the organizations that are ostensibly offering it.' Insulting or informative? The campaign, which launched on March 3rd in NYC bus shelters and subway stations, features pictures of toddlers next to messages that have been accused of being 'hostile' Polarizing public opinion: The ads, which aim to 'promote the difficulties of teen pregnancy,' are being accused of using threats and ridicule instead of offering assistance and eduction to address teen pregnancy . She wrote: 'Way to attempt to make every teen mom/person with a teen mom feel like utter s**t when they ride the subway, NYC! 'Shaming people isn't a pregnancy . prevention tool. Education, assistance, and condoms are, but misguided . subway ads aren't. There are so many wonderful teen moms, and this is basically a middle finger to them. 'Think of how it must feel for the . child of a teen mom who sees this poster. What message does that send . them? ""Better drop out now, because you're doomed to fail,""' she added. The HRA told MailOnline that the purpose of the . campaign is to highlight the challenges facing teen parents - hurdles such as raising a child before they are emotionally ready . or financially secure. 'Many teens may not be aware that having a . child before they finish school and get married means both that they . are more likely to live in poverty, and that their children will be less . likely to graduate from high school and avoid poverty in their own . lives,' HRA explained. 'Eight in 10 teen parents do not marry each other in the first . year, and the parent without custody (usually the father) is required to . pay child support until the child is 21.' The backbone of the campaign may use factual messages to deliver a 'wake-up call', but the strong messages already appear to have backfired. Waste of money? New York City's Planned Parenthood said: 'The latest campaign creates... negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people' One . Jezebel commenter wrote: 'Speaking as the child of a teen mom, I can . also say there's already a pretty awful sense of guilt that hits you . when you realize that you were unplanned and your birth completely . altered your mother's life (and more often than not, negatively affected . the quality of her life). So... yeah. Pretty crummy on a couple levels . here.' There are also many successful . single teen parents who raise brilliant children, a fact not lost on their children. One commenter, who called the campaign a 'slut-shaming pile of garbage' explained: 'My mum was 17 years old when she had me and I am extremely proud of how we both turned out. 'She may have been young and inexperienced, but the trade off was having a mum who had tons of energy, who was open minded, who gave me a fantastic education in pop culture... I could talk to her about things that no one else I knew could mention to their parents.' She continued: 'I would never recommend that someone chooses to be a teenaged mum - but I am who I am because of of my mother, and her age was a part of who she was when I was growing up.' After Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Doar unveiled the campaign, Mr Doar explained in a statement: 'Teens giving birth before they are . ready to provide emotional and financial support is not a good way to . raise children. 'We cannot dictate how people . live their lives, and sometimes even the best plans don’t work out, but . we must encourage responsibility and send the right message, especially . to young people.'","New Chicago campaign features pregnant boys rather than girls .

It is the first residential property hit by the lava that has crept towards the town of Pahoa, the largest town in Big Island's agricultural Puna district, for weeks. Scroll down for video . Incinerated: The lava flow that has crept down Hawaii's Big Island for four months has engulfed a property in the town of Pahoa . Up in smoke: Lava flow from the Kilauea Volcano burns a residential structure on Monday in a rural Hawaii town that has been watching the slow-moving flow approach for months . Slowly taking over: Lava flow from Kilauea Volcano burns vegetation as it approaches a property boundary after slowly creeping its way towards residential plots of land turning grass into ash .

The molten rock hit the house just before noon, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira. It took about 45 minutes for the 1,100-square-foot home to burn down, Oliveira said. 'The house has been destroyed,' he said. Officials said they will fight any wildfire outbreaks but plan to let sole properties burn if struck by the lava flow. Earlier in the day, lava burned down a small corrugated steel storage shed on the property, which is half a mile from its nearing neighbor. A garage or barn structure still remained on the property, but it was possible that the lava would also consume it. Obliterated: Officials said they were powerless to stop the molten rock burn the $200,000 home in the agricultural Puna district . Abandoned: The Oregon-based brothers who owned the home abandoned it and cleared it out in September . A relative of the home's owners, who live on the mainland, arrived at the site to watch the house burn, officials said. That family member drove from another part of the island about two hours away and used an iPhone to take video of the house burning. The county estimates the value of the home at about $200,000, Oliveira said. The 800 residents that reside at the base of Kilauea Volcano were warned of a potential evacuation when it erupted in late June. Around 50 families in the lava's projected path abandoned their homes. The flow entered Puna on October 26 and engulfed a cemetery. On Sunday, officials suspected the lava had come to a complete and final standstill 480 feet from the main street that runs through the town, which remains closed. Devastating: A relative of the owner drove from another part of Hawaii when they realized the house was burning but could only watch . Billowing smoke: Smoke could be seen pouring from the home and officials warned residents with breathing problems to stay inside . Blistering: The burning molten rock is continuing its advance towards Pahoa and other parts such as Leilani . Warning: The flow is still active and the main road of Pahoa town is closed to all residents in case it hits . However, a finger of molten rock broke out from the central flow and poured over the abandoned home. According to KITV, wind is blowing heavy smoke south west towards other towns such as Leilani. Residents with respiratory difficulties have been warned to remain indoors. Pahoa stands on the site of a . former sugar cane plantation on the eastern edge of the Big . Island. Kilauea's current eruption began in 1983, and the flow of . lava that has menaced Pahoa began bubbling out of the volcano's . Pu'u O'o vent on June 27.

"Jurgen Klinsmann doesn’t give the impression of a man with a burning desire to abandon all the good things he has going on for a shot at solving the perennial puzzle that is Tottenham Hotspur. Why should he? Klinsmann popped into White Hart Lane on Sunday to see Stoke beat Spurs and witnessed the fourth home defeat for Mauricio Pochettino’s team in this Barclays Premier League campaign and the reaction that went with it. If anything it must have reinforced his belief that he is in a job he adores, where he is appreciated for his efforts building the USA into a world force, and where the sun shines for up to 340 days a year. USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann poses in London, and had plenty to say on the Spurs situation . Klinsmann believes Mauricio Pochettino should be given much more time as Spurs boss . Tottenham have lost five of their opening 11 Premier League games under Pochettino this season . Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will be expecting Pochettino to turn Spurs' fortunes around quickly . ‘I wish Mauricio only the best,’ said Klinsmann. ‘He’s a tremendous, talented coach. He’s shown that already. He’s got a smart brain. Every coach needs time to put his mark on an environment, on a club, on a national team programme. Wherever you work, it’s only going to happen over time. ‘Unfortunately, professional football is driven by short-term results and high media expectations, high fan expectations and that often drives clubs to make quick decisions because they have lost five games in a row. 'If you want to evaluate the work of a coach then you can only do that over a longer period of time. For Mauricio to put his stamp on Spurs he needs time, he probably also needs a couple of transfer windows to build the team he has in mind.’ Klinsmann is in London to prepare the USA for a friendly against Colombia at Craven Cottage on Friday. He named his squad on Monday and included DeAndre Yedlin, the 21-year-old Seattle Sounders defender who has signed for Spurs and could have work permit issues sorted out in time to move in January, after acquiring a Latvian passport. Klinsmann is delighted young talent DeAndre Yedlin (right) will be honing his skills at Tottenham . Tottenham legend and current USA manager Klinsmann watched Sunday's clash at White Hart Lane . ‘We are super-excited that he is coming here,’ said Klinsmann. ‘He is highly talented, has great pace, good character, a good kid and he wants to learn. Spurs will get a huge talent, but also, similar to the coaches, a talent who needs time. 'I want DeAndre to come here to build that special relationship with Spurs. For me it was a tremendous learning experience.’ Klinsmann arrived at Tottenham in 1994 having already played at the top level in Germany, France and Italy. He stayed for one season, won Footballer of the Year and later returned on loan to help Spurs avoid relegation. He doesn’t rule out an eventual return to English football, but he is committed to the US through to the end of the next World Cup, and is relishing his role at the head of an organisation breaking new frontiers. He married an American, Debbie, and has been settled in California since 1998. They have teenage children Laila and Jonathan, and Klinsmann flies helicopters as a hobby. He is studying for a commercial licence. His children support the US in sports and Jonathan is a goalkeeper for the USA’s U18 team. Cue jokes about diving. Klinsmann has performed fantastically well as USA coach since joining in 2011 . Klinsmann had two stints at Spurs, in 1994-95 and 1997-98, scoring 29 Premier League goals . ‘I never imagined when I was a player that I would become a coach,’ said Klinsmann, but the path was set when he accepted an invitation from former Germany manager Berti Vogts to organise a coaching course and, before he knew it, he was fully qualified, helping Los Angeles Galaxy off the ground and taking charge of his country in their own World Cup. ‘Germany called and I was like: “What?” The next day, I thought: “OK”. I had two years to build something in Germany. The deadline was the first game of the World Cup and I went through a tremendous learning curve and a lot of walls. ‘It obviously ended up well and I was actually on my way here to the Premier League — I can’t say where — when Bayern Munich called. So I got that experience and again hit walls. USA impressed at the World Cup, losing at the last-16 stage to Belgium in Salvador . ‘You never know what happens tomorrow and in life. A major point is what is best for the family. I’m not making any moves, even from 2018, that don’t consider the family.’ Until then, the target is to build towards Russia 2018. ‘We’re still trying to catch up with the big football nations in the world,’ said Klinsmann. ‘Over the past few years, we’ve done quite a good job and want to do the next big step. We set the benchmark very high. Next time at the World Cup we set the benchmark at the semi-final. Many years down the road, it will definitely be the goal to win the World Cup. ‘We also have benchmarks like a club coach has every weekend, we have ours to get results and look good. It’s not that I’m totally safe here.’ Far safer, however, than any manager can be at Tottenham. VIDEO We need support - Adebayor .

"With England’s autumn series kicking off on Saturday, Sir Clive Woodward sets the scene for their four crucial matches. Sam Peters asks the questions. Sam Peters: How do you see the QBE series going for England and where are Stuart Lancaster’s team compared to yours at this stage 12 years ago? Sir Clive Woodward: The current group of English players is just as talented as the 2003 squad, but I just don’t think we’ve seen the right XV on the field playing the style of rugby required to win a World Cup. You need to create a team that can outscore any side in the world. Let’s be very clear: to win a World Cup you have to be able to outscore the southern hemisphere sides and not just the Six Nations teams. Can England beat New Zealand on Saturday? Yes. Can they win four out of four games? Absolutely. Sir Clive Woodward's 2003 side lift the Webb Ellis trophy after winning the World Cup in Australia . Peters: You beat the southern hemisphere’s top three in 2002. What did you say to the players before that series of matches? Woodward: At the beginning of a series like this everyone tries to figure out what an acceptable set of results will look like and what impact they will have on our chances at the World Cup. But ultimately it is all about the here and now and that was the approach we took in 2002. I made it clear to the players that there wasn’t going to be any selection based on ‘development’. Every team was picked to win the next game and nothing else. We staged the autumn tests as a series of ‘knockout fixtures’ to create that must-win-match attitude. We knew that if we won all three we would become the IRB’s No 1 ranked team, which would make for a great Christmas. In public we played it down, but privately that was the goal at the end of these three ‘knockout games’. England captain Chris Robshaw spins out a pass in training at Pennyhill Park this week . Peters: What do you put England’s injury crisis down to? Woodward: During my time, there were all sorts of battles going on between clubs and the union over the management of the players and, specifically, how much rugby they were playing and how they were managed when they became injured. I was determined to be at the front of the discussions in order to get what I felt was best for the players and the England team. Post-World Cup, my first major disagreement with the RFU came when it was decided, without my input, that the clubs would not only lead on the medical well-being of a player, but it was their decision whether they played or not. The RFU’s medical team believed they could ensure the player’s well-being by simply working closely with the club doctors. I totally disagreed with that philosophy. Players come under peer pressure. They are left in an impossible situation and end up playing when injured because they want to do what’s best for their club. Bath centre Kyle Eastmond is expected to start for England at Twickenham on Saturday . England’s current injury list has gone beyond simple bad luck. I would need more details before commenting on an individual basis, but Joe Launchbury’s problem surprises me. It appears from the outside as if he’s been carrying the injury for some time while continuing to play for Wasps. Why is he now missing England games? Are we now in a position where, because England are going to have all their top players from May, there is an acceptance the clubs are the priority until then? That can’t be right. We have five of the starting XV injured and Mike Brown looks like he needs a rest, too. I always encouraged the players to take individual responsibility for their well-being. Collectively the players understood the bigger picture and the effect playing with injuries at club level had to our England ambitions. We should not be facing the three biggest teams in the world with so many injuries, and it’s no surprise they are arriving with fully-fit squads. Joe Launchbury was a late withdrawal from the England training squad with a neck injury . Peters: So how does Lancaster approach the series? Woodward: Frustrating though these injuries are, England have depth — and now is the time to prove that to New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. I would be seriously concerned leaving Twickenham for the last time before the World Cup having been beaten by an England team depleted by injuries. England players won’t need reminding how great an opportunity this is to make the shirt their own, but privately I would still be winding players up. It’s wrong to play down the New Zealand game and suggest that with our injuries it’s merely a good chance to develop the squad. It’s times like this that Lancaster will see everything he needs to from the peripheral players. Can they cut it at the very top of the international game? By the end of this series he’ll know all he needs to know about guys such as Semesa Rokoduguni, Dave Attwood and Kyle Eastmond. Let’s not hide behind development, team culture or valiant efforts. We’re at Twickenham. Let’s beat these teams and be bold about it. Dave Attwood gets a chance to start at lock with both Launchbury and Geoff Parling out injured . Peters: Which players excite you most going into the series? Woodward: It’s a worry for me that no players immediately leap off the team-sheet as real X-factor types. Rokoduguni is a fantastic story and I’m looking forward to seeing if he can translate his club form on to the international stage but, make no mistake, he’s going to be targeted by the All Blacks on Saturday. If he can withstand that and come through in credit then it will give him enormous confidence going into the rest of the series. But Rokoduguni is keeping some top-class wings out of the side in Christian Wade, David Strettle and Chris Ashton — so he’s got plenty to prove. Semesa Rokoduguni is likely to be targeted by the All Blacks on his England debut at Twickenham . Peters: What about from the opposition? Woodward: Israel Folau is such a powerful and destructive runner and absolutely superb under the high ball. He gives Australia a completely different attacking option with his pace and physicality. He’s a brilliant player who will excite anyone who watches him. Whoever the Wallabies play at 10-12 will also be a threat. They went for Quade Cooper and Matt Toomua against the Barbarians, but they have such an array of talent, with players such as Christian Lealiifano waiting in the wings, that their midfield combination is bound to be dangerous. Then there’s Handre Pollard. The 20-year-old fly-half was absolutely outstanding for the Springboks as they beat the All Blacks when the sides last met. With a traditionally monstrous Springbok pack in front of him, he looks a huge prospect. I’m also a huge admirer of lock Eben Etzebeth. He’s a hugely powerful athlete who walks like a gunslinger and has an attitude to match. South Africa lock Eben Etzebeth (right) is a player Sir Clive Woodward is looking forward to seeing this autumn . Peters: Sorry for repeating myself, but can England really beat the All Blacks? Woodward: Of course they can. The great thing for them is that public expectation levels are low because of the players missing. There’s almost nothing to lose. They can cast off the shackles and play with a pace and tempo that gets the Twickenham crowd on their feet. I’m excited by that prospect and I really hope the players are, too.

"Jaguar is making a bold leap into the future – and the unknown - by launching its first ever 4X4. The sporty ‘crossover’ from the luxury British car company best known for its high-performance  sports-cars and luxury limousines is to be unveiled as a prototype at next month’s Frankfurt motor Show before rolling off UK production lines in 2016 priced from around £30,000. Early details of what is set to become a firm favourite with school-run mums are revealed today in the latest edition of the respected Autocar, the world’s longest running motoring magazine. The car maker's first ever 4x4 (pictured): It is set to be unveiled as a prototype at next month's Frankfurt motor Show before rolling off UK production lines in 2016 priced from around £30,000 . It coincided with Jaguar Land Rover announcing a 25 per cent jump in profits to £415m. The five-door crossover will be aimed at younger and more affluent families with children. One insider said: 'You rarely see one of today’s Jaguar models with a child-seat in the back. The crossover will tap into that market.' Feedback from  top secret and anonymous ‘customer clinics’ held in the Midlands has been very encouraging with one participant describing the new car as ‘stunning’. Aggressive product development plans: Jaguar is also planning a new 'baby' saloon car (pictured) and a range of small fuel-efficient coupes from £20,000 to follow in the wake of its new F-Type sports car . Based on eye-witness accounts, Autocar has recreated how the new car will look. Jaguar bosses say it is part of their ‘aggressive product development plans’. Jaguar . is also planning a new ‘baby’ Jaguar saloon and a range of small . fuel-efficient coupes from £20,000 to follow in the wake of its new . F-Type sports car. Autocar Editor Jim Holder said: ‘Jaguar always promised us that the F-Type was just the start of an all-out revolution. Now we have the living proof. Early details of Jaguar's new 4x4 are revealed today in the latest edition of Autocar, the world's longest running motoring magazine . 'With a red-blooded sports car at the . heart of its range, Jaguar clearly feels the time is right to expand . rapidly and aggressively – and how. That the firm is taking a crossover . to the Frankfurt motor show is the ultimate display of confidence.’ He . said of Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s TATA group: ‘The . investment has been immense. Jaguar’s ambitious growth plan requires it . to be a success. Failure is not an option. 'These are pressurised times at Jaguar. But how great to see the firm approaching them with such a confident swagger.’ Experts believe the new car will be built at Land Rover’s factory in Solihull rather than at Jaguar’s plant at Castle Bromwich in Birmingham. The news comes as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reported increased profits for the first part of the financial year. The Coventry-based company's pre-tax profits for April-June totalled £415million - a 25per cent  rise on the April-June 2012 period. Revenues rose 13per cent to just under £4.1billion while retail sales were up 10per cent to 94,719.UK sales rose 13per cent, while Asia Pacific was up 37per cent, China up 11per cent, North America up 10per cent and Europe up 3per cent. JLR chief executive Ralf Speth said: ‘The result for the first quarter demonstrates that our full range of new and upgraded products is exciting our customers.’ It marks a bumper week for the British car industry. New car sales have raced ahead again, according to official figures. A total of 162,228 new cars were registered in July 2013 - a 12.7% rise on the July 2012 figure, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). This was the 17th successive monthly increase and took the year-so-far total to 1,325,851 - a 10.3per cent increase on the January-July 2012 figure. The strong sales in recent months has meant the SMMT has revised upwards its year-end figure for 2013. The society now expects annual sales to reach just under 2.22 million. This would be 8per cent up on the 2012 total and the best annual figure since 2007. A Jaguar F-Type, which has proven popular, is seen here at a previous Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland . The unusual styling of Jaguar's F-Type concept car, featuring the latest aerodynamic aids for optimum dynamic performance, has caught the imagination of connoisseurs . An early sketch of the F-type Jaguar: Autocar Editor Jim Holder says: 'Jaguar always promised us that the F-Type was just the start of an all-out revolution. Now we have the living proof' Meanwhile the new generation Mini will be launched in Oxford later this year - on an auspicious day in UK motoring history. Mini . owner BMW has chosen the launch date of November 18, which is the 107th . anniversary of the birth of the Mini's founding father Sir Alexander . Issigonis. BMW's Cowley plant in Oxford will host the world premiere of . the new car, with a party in London that evening. The . car will then be displayed that week at the Los Angeles and Tokyo motor . shows, with the vehicle going on sale in the UK early next year. Small, nippy and affordable, the original Mini was a sensation when it first went on sale in 1959 just as many households, hitherto predominantly carless, were thinking of splashing out on a vehicle. It was seen as the first 'classless car' and remained hugely popular for decades. After taking over the Rover car company from British Aerospace in 1994, BMW started making the new, bigger, Mini at Oxford in 2001 and the car has continued to catch the public's imagination with around 50,000 a year sold in the UK.","The sporty 'crossover' car is set to become a favourite with school-run mums .

"The battle for space supremacy between North and South Korea intensified today as South Korea successfully launched a satellite into space from its own soil for the first time. It comes just weeks after after arch-rival North Korea accomplished a similar feat to the surprise of the world. The South Korean rocket blasted off from a launch pad in the south-western coastal village of Goheung. Scroll down for video of the launch . Lift off: The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) takes off at Naro Space Centre in Goheung in South Korea's first successful launch of a satellite into orbit . Flexing its muscles: The launch is a culmination of years of efforts by South Korea to advance its space program and cement its standing as a technology powerhouse .

Science officials told cheering . spectators minutes later that the rocket delivered an observational . satellite into orbit. There was no immediate confirmation that the . satellite was operating as intended. The launch is a culmination of years of efforts by South Korea - Asia's fourth-largest economy - to advance its space program and cement its standing as a technology powerhouse whose semiconductors, smartphones and automobiles command global demand. North Korea's long-range rocket program, in contrast, has generated international fears that it is getting closer to developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S. South Korea's success comes amid increased tension on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's threat to explode its third nuclear device. Pyongyang is angry over tough new international sanctions over its December 12 rocket launch and has accused its rivals of applying double standards toward the two Koreas' space programs. Capturing the imagination: South Koreans gather round a television at Seoul Railway Station to watch the launch, which comes amid increased tension over North Korea's threat to explode its third nuclear device . Anxious wait: The launch comes weeks after arch-rival North Korea accomplished a similar feat to the surprise of the world . Third time lucky: South Korea tried and failed to launch satellites in 2009 and 2010, and more recent launch attempts were aborted at the last minute .

Fears spread: South Korean protesters burn a mock rocket as police officers spray fire extinguishers during a rally in Seoul denouncing North Korea's rocket launch on December 12 . South Korean officials said it will help them develop more sophisticated satellites in the future. U.S. experts have described the North's satellite as tumbling in space and said it does not appear to be functioning, though Pyongyang has said it is working. The South Korean rocket launched today had its first stage designed and built by Russian experts under a contract between the two governments.

"From dolls houses and miniature dinner party sets, to baseball bats, sunglasses and stuffed teddy bears – these remarkable photographs show the vastly different toys that children from around the world play with on a daily basis. Photographer Gabriele Galimberti spent over a year visiting more than 50 countries around the world and documenting the prized possessions of young boys and girls. From Texas to India, Malawi to China and Iceland to Morocco, Mr Galimberti recorded the spontaneous and natural joy that unites children despite their diverse backgrounds. Photographer Gabriele Galimberti has spent between 18 months and three years visiting dozens of countries to capture images of the toys children play with around the world. Three-year-old Tyra, pictured with her dolls set and miniature dinner party set, is from Stockholm, Sweden, and features in Mr Galimberti's pictures . The fascinating photographs show the different childhoods youngsters have. Gabriele Galimberti visited more than 50 countries to show the different toys children play with. In Mchinji, Malawai, he met four-year-old Chiwa, pictured, who plays with soft teddy bears and a plastic dinosaur .

Whether the child owns a fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride that Gabriele Galimberti captures is moving, funny, and thought provoking. He visited more than 50 countries including India, China, Morocco, America, Malawi and Puerto Viejo de Talamanca in Costa Rica where he met three-year-old Naya, pictured . The range of photographs shows boys and girls in their homes and neighbourhoods with their most prized possessions: their toys. In Homer, Alaska, five-year-old Niko's toy collection includes Lego pieces, pictured . Ben Machell, who wrote the introduction to the book Toy Stories, said: 'These toys, Galimberti began to realise, said as much about the mothers and fathers as they did about the children themselves.' In Muskoka, Canada, six-year-old Lauren's favourite toy is a doll dressed in a pink outfit similar to her own, pictured . Ben Machell said in the introduction to the book Toy Stories: 'Everyone remembers their childhood toys. The fact that I can recall how most of mine tasted better than I can remember the names of my primary school teachers says everything you need to know about the universe kids inhabit.' Five-year-old Shotaro, from Tokyo, Japan, is pictured with his favourite toy - baseball bats . The remarkable collection of photographs shows the distinct difference between children's toys in differing countries. In Zambia Gabriele Galimberti met Maudy, three, whose toy collection consists of brightly-coloured sunglasses, pictured . Introducing the Toy Stories book, Ben Machell, said: 'More common was how the toys reflected the world each child was born into: so the boy from an affluent Beijing family loves Monopoly, because he likes the idea of building houses and hotels, while the boy from rural Mexico loves trucks, because he sees them rumbling through his village to the nearby sugar plantation every day.' Pictured - Enea, three, from Colorado . Four-year-old Taha, from Beirut, Lebanon, pictured, features in the book with his one and only toy - a toy car. He's a refugee together with his family and lives in a 'sort of shantytown' with a few thousand other people .

"Derby's march towards the Barclays Premier League stuttered as they fell to a shock 2-0 defeat at Fulham. The Sky Bet Championship leaders arrived at Craven Cottage unbeaten in seven matches, but were undone by a Fulham side previously without a win in six thanks to goals from Nikolay Bodurov and Cauley Woodrow. In a lacklustre display, it took the Rams over an hour to register an effort on target against a team who they had put 10 goals past in their previous two meetings this season. Nikolay Bodurov of Fulham scores the opener against Derby County at Craven Cottage . Bodurov celebrates after putting his side in front after 21 minutes against the league leaders . Fulham: Bettinelli, Richards, Bodurov, Hutchinson, Stafylidis, Parker (Hoogland 79'), Tunnicliffe, Christensen (Kavanagh 43'), Ruiz, McCormack, Woodrow (Dembele 86'). Subs not used: Kiraly, Kacaniklic, Fofana, Burn . Booked: Tunnicliffe . Goals: Bodurov 31' Woodrow 45' Derby: Grant, Christie (Buxton 46'), Keogh, Shotton, Forsyth, Hendrick, Mascarell, Hughes, Ince, Bent (Bryson 64'), Lingard (Russell 46') Subs not used: Dawkins, Ward, Roos, Albentosa . Booked: Russell . Referee: Mike Jones . Former Fulham loanee Darren Bent fired an early shot wide for the Rams, but the hosts dominated the rest of the first half and had a two-goal lead at the break which they never looked like relinquishing. Ross McCormack and Ryan Tunnicliffe flashed shots wide, Shaun Hutchinson headed over and Lee Grant made a good save after Scott Parker's drive flicked off the head of Woodrow before Fulham made the breakthrough in the 31st minute. Bryan Ruiz skipped past Tom Ince on the left-hand side of the Derby area and when the Costa Rica forward's shot was blocked by Cyrus Christie, the ball looped up towards Bodurov on the corner of the six-yard box. The Bulgarian centre-half, not renowned for his finishing, had only stayed upfield following a corner but he expertly guided the ball over Grant with the outside of his right boot for his first goal since joining Fulham last summer. And on the stroke of half-time Woodrow, only in the starting line-up because of an injury to Hugo Rodallega, doubled Fulham's lead. Cauley Woodrow then headed home from close range to put Fulham 2-0 in front . Woodrow celebrates putting Fulham 2-0 in front just before half time . Parker won the ball in midfield and scampered forward before laying the ball off to McCormack, who chipped in an inviting cross for the onrushing Woodrow to nod in at the far post. Derby had come from two goals down to thrash Fulham 5-2 in the Capital One Cup in October but there was no sign a of a repeat performance, especially after Bent limped off holding his hamstring. Ryan Shotton headed an early chance wide while Ince's deflected shot finally gave Marcus Bettinelli something to do, before the Fulham keeper kept out a Jeff Hendrick header at the far post. But it was Fulham, who were starting to look anxiously over their shoulders at the relegation battle following their recent poor run, who came closest to scoring again. McCormack was denied by a last-ditch block by Craig Forsyth and a point-blank save from Grant before sub Moussa Dembele crashed a shot against the crossbar late on.","Championship leaders Derby County suffer damaging defeat .

"Arsene Wenger will be handed £20million in January to help rescue Arsenal’s season. And with that cash, the Gunners boss will prioritise a new central defender after it became clear his side are drastically short in the position. Wenger has also accepted he must capture a new holding midfielder, but he is likely to wait until the summer when he will have a larger budget. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be handed £20million in January to help rescue their season . Wenger will prioritise a new central defender after it became clear his side are drastically short in the position . Signing a centre back is the most pressing issue, with Wenger’s decision not to replace Thomas Vermaelen proving a major mistake after the Gunners were hit by a string of injuries. Left back Nacho Monreal has been played as a makeshift central defender following injuries to Mathieu Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny. Arsenal’s problems in defence were underlined last week when they threw away a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League, then lost 2-1 to Swansea on Sunday despite being 1-0 up with 15 minutes left. Arsenal will discuss their defensive options during a scouting meeting this week, as revealed by Sportsmail. Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk, West Ham’s Winston Reid, Aston Villa’s Ron Vlaar and Manchester United’s Chris Smalling were all considered in the summer. Vlaar and Reid could both be available in cut-price deals because their contracts expire at the end of the season.

"Fulham boss Kit Symons has received public backing from chairman Shahid Khan despite a run of eight games without a win which has seen the club slip back into relegation trouble. Khan, writing in the programme for Saturday's game against Derby, has made it clear, however, that there were funds made available during the January transfer window which Symons chose not to spend. The American tycoon, aware of the disruption caused by instability since he arrived at Craven Cottage in 2013, has told his manager he trusts him as the football expert and admires his faith in the current squad. Kit Symons' job is safe for now, with Shahid Khan putting his faith in the manager for footballing matters . Fulham spent big on the likes of Ross McCormack this summer, but chose not to in January . Khan said: 'We were certainly mindful of the January transfer window and the opportunities – or temptations - it offers. For every successful move in the transfer season there may be half a dozen that fail to produce results, as supporters of Fulham and likely every club in England understand all too well. 'Nevertheless, while caution is advised when browsing the transfer market, clubs should be prepared to pounce if the right player is available at the right time. 'At Fulham, we were prepared with the appropriate resources and full authority if it made perfect sense. Manager Kit Symons sees our players daily. As a top-flight player not that long ago, Kit knows and feels the game. 'He understands and appreciates the Fulham way. And Kit knows what we all want, and that's a side that will make us proud and compete for a return to the Premier League. Bakary Sako of Wolves takes a shot in a 3-0 win, as Fulham made it eight games without a win . Khan hopes his players will repay their manager's faith as the club battles against consecutive relegation . 'It's good to have someone as our manager who wants to achieve success in a proper manner. So, I have to applaud Kit for his discipline and restraint during this particular January transfer window when the easy and likely popular move would have been to spend for the sake of appearing to be active. 'The truth is, Kit was active. Kit didn't feel the right options were there. As you all know, Fulham endured some drama over the past 18 months with our managers.' Symons became Khan's fourth manager in little more than a year in control when he replaced Felix Magath in September. Magath came in after Rene Meulensteen and Martin Jol but was unable to prevent relegation from the Barclays Premier League last year. Fulham improved after a poor start to the season but have not won since the transfer market closed. Distant play-off hopes have faded, they have slipped back towards the bottom of the Championship and face in-form Derby next. Khan added: 'We've become a more cohesive club, on and off the pitch, since Kit was promoted to manager in September. There's a lot of football left this season. I'm confident we'll finish the season safe, sound and strong. Shahid Khan has had four managers since taking over the club, but is now looking for stability under Symons . 'But in any event, I pay great respect to Kit for having faith in and standing by the players we've had all season to send us upward. What can be better than having a manager who has unconditional faith in you? 'The hope here is that our squad honours Kit's faith and responds appropriately and immediately with Saturday's encounter against Derby. A positive result against the league leaders in front of the home supporters would do nicely. 'In the meantime, I want to assure all Fulham fans that Kit and the Club will always have my full commitment and attention. If Kit feels there's an option to consider during the emergency transfer period, he'll have my total support to act. 'There will be no uncertainty or lack of communication, as I speak at great length with Kit, Mike Rigg and Alistair Mackintosh every Monday, at a minimum. 'They're all aware of my trust and support in each of them. And the same applies for everyone at Motspur Park and Craven Cottage. We have a great club at Fulham, and we will fight through this difficult stretch successfully, united as one.'","Kit Symons has been Fulham manager since September .

"Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has ballooned so much due to high oil and gas prices that every person in the country became a theoretical millionaire this week. The Nordic nation is proving to be an exception as others struggle under a mountain of debts. Set up in 1990, the fund owns around 1 percent of the world's stocks, as well as bonds and real estate from London to Boston. The surplus revenue is collected in the Government Pension Fund Global. Boom: Norway's sovereign wealth fund has ballooned so much due to high oil and gas prices that every person in the country became a theoretical millionaire this week. Pictured: Bergen . A preliminary counter on the website of the central bank, which manages the fund, rose to 5.11 trillion kroner (£503.46 billion/$828.66 billion). This equates to fractionally more than a million times Norway's most recent official population estimate of 5,096,300. It was the first time it reached the equivalent of a million kroner each, central bank spokesman Thomas Sevang said. Not that Norwegians will be able to access or spend the money - it is squirreled away for a rainy day for them and future generations. Norway has resisted the temptation to splurge all the windfall since striking oil in the North Sea in 1969 . The amount is only equivalent to just under £100,000 in sterling. Not that Norwegians will be able to access or spend the money - it is squirreled away for a rainy day for them and future generations. But the oil wealth may have made some people reluctant to work - according to Oeystein Doerum, chief economist at DNB Markets 'one in five people of working age receives some kind of social insurance instead of working.' But Norway is expensive. Oslo, where a pint of beer costs £5, is the world's most expensive capital according to the Economist. Dinner for two in an average restaurant can easily cost £200. Norway has resisted the temptation to splurge all the windfall since striking oil in the North Sea in 1969. Finance . Minister Siv Jensen told Reuters the fund, called the Government . Pension Fund Global, had helped iron out big, unpredictable swings in . oil and gas prices. Norway is the world's number seven oil exporter. 'Many countries have found that temporary large revenues from natural resource exploitation produce relatively short-lived booms that are followed by difficult adjustments,' she said in an email. The fund, equivalent to 183 percent of 2013 gross domestic product, is expected to peak at 220 percent around 2030. 'The fund is a success in the sense that parliament has managed to put aside money for the future. There are many examples of countries that have mot managed that,' said Oeystein Doerum, chief economist at DNB Markets. Norway has sought to avoid the boom and bust cycle by investing the cash abroad, rather than at home. Governments can spend 4 percent of the fund in Norway each year, slightly more than the annual return on investment. Still, in Norway, oil wealth may have made the state reluctant to make reforms or cut subsidies unthinkable elsewhere. Farm subsidies allow farmers, for instance, to keep dairy cows in heated barns in the Arctic. It may also have made some Norwegians reluctant to work. 'One in five people of working age receives some kind of social insurance instead of working,' Doerum said, despite an official unemployment rate of 3.3 percent.","Sovereign wealth fund ballooned due to high oil and gas prices .

"Motherwell will become a hub for showcasing South American talent if a London-based consortium seizes control of the club in the coming weeks. Sportsmail can reveal a group of businessmen want to buy a majority stake in the Fir Park outfit with a view to giving emerging players from overseas a foothold in the European game. Newcastle’s former Peruvian international winger Nolberto Solano attended Motherwell’s victory over Dundee United on Friday night and it’s believed he will be installed as manager if the deal gets over the line. Nolberto Solano is being lined up to take over as Motherwell boss if a consortium buy the club . Motherwell owner John Boyle has handed his 70-per-cent stake to the club with those shares currently being held in a trust fund in the hope the Well Society — the community-based group advocating an ownership — can purchase them. However, hope of this materialising before this month’s deadline expires is shrouded in doubt. While the Well Society have so far raised £500,000, it needs to show that £800,000 is in its bank by the end of November for the deal to remain on track. With the prospect of fan-ownership seemingly dwindling, the London-based consortium have moved into the picture and have made their intentions known to key figures at the club. Solano watched Motherwell's victory over Dundee United last Friday . It’s believed, however, that the club — and not Boyle — would still benefit financially if the consortium, rather than the Society, purchase the shares. While a new regime would undoubtedly excite some fans, it’s unlikely to meet with the approval of the Society. Hinting at the possibility of an alternative takeover in its most recent news letter last month, the Society stated: ‘Given we are very nearly at the cut-off point, we needed to act quickly to make sure that the club remains in the hands of Motherwell fans – there are no guarantees that will be the case if the Well Society does not reach the funds required by the end of November.’ Boyle announced in February 2011 that he was to stand down as chairman at Fir Park which would ‘allow wider ownership and involvement in the club for all who care about it’. While this hasn’t materialised yet, the Society has helped Motherwell meet cash-flow problems with £780,000 lost in the two seasons between 2011-13 and a further loss predicted for last season. Stuart McCall resigned as Motherwell boss after a poor run of form in the Scottish Premiership . Despite the possibility of a takeover, the club are still searching for a successor for Stuart McCall as manager. Sportsmail understands Billy McKinlay and Owen Coyle are among the names under consideration. McKinlay is out of work having bizarrely lasted just eight days as Watford manager last month. Last night, when asked if he would be interested in the job, he said: ‘Absolutely. Everyone I’ve spoken to over the years has told me it’s a really good club.’ Coyle has spoken to Houston Dynamo and Philadelphia Union about their vacancies but remains available for hire. Other names in the frame include Derek Adams, ex-Celtic coach Peter Grant and former Iceland manager Atli Edvalsson.","A London-based consortium are considering a bid for Motherwell .

"Leaving the European Union would not be 'cataclysmic' for Britain, Boris Johnson claimed today as pressure mounted on David Cameron to offer an early referendum on severing ties with Brussels. The London Mayor said he backed the Prime Minister's plan to negotiate a new deal with the EU, but said he should be prepared to walk away if talks fail. Tory MPs are to be given a free vote next . week on a backbench amendment to the Queen's Speech that expresses ‘regret’ about the lack of legislation for a referendum on Europe. Boris Johnson said Britain could survive outside the EU, and David Cameron should 'walk away' if he cannot get a better deal from Brussels . Lib Dem, leader Nick Clegg and former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling have warned 3million jobs depend on Britain remaining in the EU. But Mr Johnson insisted that withdrawal would not be as damaging to the UK economy as pro-Europeans claim. 'I don't think it would be anything like as cataclysmic as is being sometimes pretended,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'I don't think we would lose millions of jobs. I think the economic benefits and disbenefits are now much more balanced.' He backed Mr Cameron's renegotiation plan, but said Britain should be willing to walk away. 'My position is that I think the Prime Minister is completely right. What we need to do is to say to our friends and partners ""Listen chums, this thing isn't working for either of us. Your eurozone is causing all sorts of misery, plus the on-costs, the non-wage costs, of the way the EU has been running and has legislated and regulated over the last 20-30 years are making the whole area completely uncompetitive"". 'We need a renegotiation. We need a look at the way the thing is managed. We should be prepared to pull out. That goes without saying. You can't go into a negotiation like that without being willing to walk away.' Mr Cameron last night allowed ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech as he struggled to contain a growing Tory mutiny on the issue of Europe. Senior Tories ignored the Prime Minister’s pleas to pipe down on the issue in the wake of last week’s elections, when UKIP gave the Tories a bloody nose. Prime Minister David Cameron today took aim at 'pessimists' about his Europe strategy . Speaking in London yesterday, Mr . Cameron hit out at the ‘pessimists’ in his own party who warn it will be . impossible for him to claw back powers from Brussels and negotiate a . better deal for Britain in Europe. He said Tory grandees such as former . chancellor Nigel Lawson and one-time leadership contender Michael . Portillo were ‘wrong’ to say Britain should leave the EU now. Former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont . also suggested Britain would be better off out, saying the economic . advantages of EU membership were ‘vastly over-stated’. And a third former chancellor, Labour’s Denis Healey said he now believed the ‘case for leaving is stronger than staying in’. Tory rebels last night revealed they . had tabled an amendment to the Queen’s Speech criticising the lack of . legislation to hold an in/out referendum. Mr Cameron has told his MPs he is . unable to bring forward government legislation to enact his pledge to . hold a referendum in 2017 because of opposition from the LibDems. But Number 10 last night said he was . ‘relaxed’ about the amendment and suggested Tory MPs and ministers would . be free to vote for it. If Commons Speaker John Bercow agrees . to the vote it will be held next Tuesday. Mr Cameron will be on an . official visit to the US, but other Cabinet ministers are expected to . vote in what would be a criticism of their own Queen’s Speech and a . clear sign of dissatisfaction with the Coalition. The amendment is purely symbolic but . its supporters claim it will help build an unstoppable momentum for a . referendum to be held. Backers include Eurosceptics John Baron, Peter Bone and John Redwood, and maverick Nadine Dorries. The amendment does not demand . legislation on a referendum but ‘respectfully regrets’ that no bill was . included in Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech, which set out the Government’s . legislative agenda for the coming year. Mr Baron said its purpose was to send a clear message that the demand for a bill was ‘not going away’. It underlines the pressure Mr Cameron is facing to sanction backbench legislation on a referendum. The Prime Minister’s official . spokesman said he had ‘always said he is very happy to look at all ways . of strengthening his commitment to an in/out referendum in the next . Parliament’. David Cameron is under pressure to bring forward legislation on his promise to stage an EU referendum . Former defence secretary Michael Portillo said he would vote to quit Brussels while London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured yesterday, argued Britain could survive outside the EU . Yesterday Mr Cameron told a conference . he was right to try to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU . before putting the new deal to a referendum after the next election. He said: ‘I think it is possible to change and reform this organisation and change and reform Britain’s relationship with it.’ Lib Dem sources said it would be ‘extraordinary’ for Tory ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech. A source said: ‘The Conservatives seem . to want to talk about Europe when we should be talking about the . positive things in the Queen’s Speech like the reforms on pensions and . social care.’","London Mayor backs the idea of renegotiation but not at any cost .

"@SarahTheDuchess: ‘Forgiveness comes when we have the chance to see it as a learning curve and move forward with knowledge ... forgiving ourselves’ The Duchess of York has sent a string of cryptic tweets seemingly talking about her past ‘recklessness’. Prince Andrew’s former wife, who in 2010 was filmed by the News of the World allegedly offering to sell access to her ex-husband for £500,000, wrote on the social media network yesterday: ‘Sometimes we look back at our life, dropping our jaw at our stupid recklessness.’ One minute later the former royal, who tweets under the name @SarahTheDuchess, wrote: ‘Forgiveness comes when we have the chance to see it as a learning curve and move forward with knowledge, also forgiving ourselves.’ Friends were last night puzzled at the timing of the messages to her 78,728 followers, but one said: ‘She is in a good place at the moment. She has clearly got her life back together after the events of recent years.’ The Duchess endured a roller coaster ride – often of her own making - as a member of the Royal Family following her marriage to the Queen’s son in 1986. After being caught having her toes sucked by her ‘financial advisor’ John Bryan, the pair were forced to divorce in 1996. A furious Princess Margaret wrote to her say: ‘You have done more to bring shame on the Royal Family than could ever have been imagined. Not once have you hung your head in embarrassment, even for a minute. ‘Clearly you have never considered the damage you are doing us all. How dare you discredit us?’ Having walked away with a relatively paltry divorce settlement of just £300,000, matters became worse, however, as Sarah’s profligate spending saw her run up £4 million in debts with the Queen’s bank, Coutts. The scandal saw the Duchess forced to take on a string of work commitment and endorsements in the US, including a lucrative deal with WeightWatchers, cashing in on the own difficult relationship with food. Her hard work saw her become a wealthy woman in the her own right but in 2006 Sarah’s finances took another battering after a US company set up to capitalise on her image in the US collapsed owing more than £1 million. Facing bankruptcy and a string of county court cases over her new set of debts, she found herself caught up in the tabloid sting. Scroll down for video . Cryptic: Two of the mysterious tweets sent by Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York yesterday . Four years later, however, her debts have been paid off – largely with the help of Prince Andrew, with whom she still lives at his official residence, Royal Lodge in Windsor – and she has lost more than two stone in weight. She is now, say sources close to the Duchess, flying to New York once a month on a new project she is working on which is looking to tackle obesity as well as working on a film project about Prince Albert. ‘I’m not sure whether these tweets directly refer to her personal situation, but the Duchess is doing well. She has lost weight in a sensible way and has a great deal of business projects and charitable initiatives on the go,’ they said. ‘She is looking to the future not the past.’","The Duchess endured a roller coaster ride as a member of the Royal Family .

The tumultuous relationship between the former vice presidential candidate's daughter and her former fiancé has landed their son Tripp in Bristol's care for much of his life, but Johnston wanted to change that. Johnston, 23, filed to have equal custody of the now-4-year-old boy but that petition was thrown out by Judge Gregory Heath- who was appointed to the bench by Sarah Palin when she was governor in 2009- who mandated that Tripp remain in the primary custody of his mother Bristol, 23. Staying with mom: Bristol Palin retains full custody of her son Tripp, seen here together in June during the filming of their Lifetime reality show . Status quo: In October, Levi Johnston (right) filed to change their previous custody agreement, in which Bristol (left) retained full custody and he had visitation rights . According to Radar Online, Johnston filed the custody claim in October and Palin fired back with claims that he was $67,000 behind in child support payments. The 'mama grizzly' herself waded into the fight when she called him a 'deadbeat dad' when asked about the custody battle in November. Johnston could have filed an opposition to his ex-fiancée’s claims, but he never put it through the legal process and asked for an extension- but not until after the due date had passed. This ruling means that Johnston will only see his son for temporary periods of time, which is the same program that has been in place since the couple split. Mama Grizzly: Sarah Palin (seen with Bristol in May 2011) came to her daughters defense when the custody battle started, saying that Johnston was a 'deadbeat dad' as he was $67,000 behind in child support payments . At the time, they put on a united front and agreed to co-parent their baby boy, but with the understanding that Bristol would have primary custody. 'Levi and I are turning a new page here as co-parents to this wonderful boy, and putting aside the past because doing so is in Tripp's best interest,' Bristol said to Good Morning America in June 2010. Weeks later, the couple announced that they were back together which was timed with a cover photo shoot for Us Weekly with the threesome wearing matching white outfits and posing on an Alaskan mountain top. 'I really thought we were over,' Levi said at the time. New couple: Johnston is now married to Sunny Oglesby, the mother of his second child Breeze Beretta . The Palin past: Bristol and Levi welcomed their son, Tripp, in December 2008, and were together at the time . That truly is the case now, however, as Levi has since had another child and married his new girlfriend. Johnston's daughter Breeze Beretta was born in September 2012 and he married the girl's mother Summer Oglesby that October. Levi, who famously posed for Playgirl immediately after he and Palin called off their engagement following the 2008 presidential election, is now working as an electrician.","Judge ruled in Bristol Palin's favor and kept the couple's custody agreement as stands .

"This is the touching moment orphaned leopard Pardus bounds towards her human companion, attempting to curl up on her lap and clamber all over her. Despite her huge size, the black leopard can be seen enjoying a playful tumble with volunteer Juhi Agrawal, who has worked with the abandoned animal since she was a cub. Completely unaware of her enormous frame, the leopard spots her friend and leaps up onto a platform, trying to sit on her lap and scrambling all over her, much as a kitten would. The big cat, whose coat appears to be solid black . because her spots are hard to distinguish, was abandoned by her mother . when it was just a few hours old. She was taken to Cheetah Experience, a . charity which carries out conservation work in South Africa, where she . was raised by volunteer Juhi Agrawal who is pictured in the video. Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen, founder of the charity, said: ‘She is just jumping and playing like they would in a tree. ‘The human interaction enriches their lives in captivity. We take them out on walks so they are not in the cages all the time. Pardus loves her walks on the plains. ‘When she is a bit older, we will introduce her to our breeding programme which is aimed at preventing the animals from becoming extinct.’ Wham: The black leopard appears to pounce on Juhi Agrawal, the woman who raised it, in the enclosure in a wildlife centre in South Africa. But the animal was just playing . Ms Van Nieuwenhuizen said: ‘When we found her she weighed just 300g, which is quite light for a leopard cub. Normally they weigh 500g when they are born. ‘We suspect her mother abandoned her because she did not have enough milk for her. ‘She was completely helpless so we took her in. She would not have survived otherwise.’ Volunteers come from all over the world to work at the centre and interact with the animals. She added that the leopards like Pardus, are reared from birth by humans so they do not pose a threat. Cuddle: Juhi Agrawal cuddles the leopard she raised at the Cheetah Experience in South Africa . She said: ‘It’s very safe to interact with the leopards. We don’t take any chances with the volunteers.’ Sadly, the animals will not be released back into the wild. Ms Van Nieuwenhuizen said: ‘Unfortunately, the ones that are born in captivity have to stay in captivity. We do not want to mix the genes of a leopard in captivity with one in the wild.’ The centre is also home to cheetahs, wolves, lions, caracals, servals and meerkats. Ms Van Nieuwenhuizen set up the charity after spending 22 years working for the Department of Justice and realising that it was not her calling in life. She resigned and used a loan to buy her first animal – a cheetah. From there, she took on more animals and built up the centre which she hopes will save the animals from extinction.","Cub was abandoned because its mother did not have enough milk .

"The old managerial head versus the emerging force, the established team of winners versus the homegrown heroes. The Capital One Cup has many intriguing sub-plots and Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai caught up with three legends of both clubs — Graham Roberts, Glenn Hoddle and Micky Hazard — to discuss how it might pan out. Chelsea and Tottenham are set to face off in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday . Mail on Sunday: Chelsea v Tottenham — a game close to all your hearts. How do you assess where they both stand? Hazard: What a great cup final. Chelsea are the finished article and they have probably the best manager in the world whereas Spurs are a work in progress with a young, up-and-coming manager. Roberts: On paper it’s Chelsea’s to win but Spurs learnt on New Year’s Day that they can beat Chelsea. That will be a big factor in this — Spurs don’t have that doubt that they will have had before. Hoddle: Spurs beating them 5-3 at the Lane will definitely give them a lot of confidence. You need belief going into a final. On the negative side, Tottenham playing on Thursday is very difficult for the manager. Another big question is the goalkeeper and I would definitely play the No 1 (Hugo Lloris over Michel Vorm). Jose Mourinho’s first trophy with Chelsea was the League Cup in 2005 and this game can get Spurs back on the trophy trail. Michel Vorm has been Tottenham's Capital One Cup goalkeeper this season but could be dropped . MoS: What do you make of the homegrown contingent coming through at Spurs? It’s probably the one area where Spurs have done noticeably better. Hazard: In three or four years we could be talking about a very special group. I actually brought Ryan Mason to the club as an eight-year-old and Harry Kane has taken the league by storm. He was unbelievable against Chelsea in the 5-3. But look at the players Chelsea have brought in — Eden Hazard. What a super player. Then you have Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas. It’s hard to see how they get beaten on paper. Roberts: Hazard is only just behind Messi and Ronaldo and has time ahead of him. On song he will win any game by himself. Costa, when he is on form, is a real handful. But saying that, I don’t think (Federico) Fazio has ever lost against him. Micky Hazard played for Chelsea from 1985-90 after playing for Tottenham for seven seasons . MoS: Kane for England? Hoddle: He has improved so quickly this season but we’d be stupid to think that improvement curve is going to keep rising at the same speed. But if he keeps at the level he is now that is magnificent. If he can maintain the consistency, playing different roles, he’ll go into the England squad. He’s not in front of the likes of Daniel Sturridge at the moment but if he continues to flourish and score more goals, he’ll force his way in. Harry Kane is set to lead the line for Tottenham against Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday . MoS: Kane’s had an impact, but so has Jose Mourinho. People are perhaps getting tired of some of his talking, especially with recent incidents. Is it a distraction to the team? Hoddle: I don’t think it’s a good thing. I can see he’s trying to put his point across but for me that has to be done behind the scenes, directly to the powers that be. I feel it’s a distraction. Their form hasn’t been great while this has all been happening, put it that way. Roberts: He does talk a lot. But I think he is 100 per cent good for the Premier League. When he left last time I think the division lost a little bit of its soul. But aside from that charisma, he is probably the best manager in the world. But we all love a character. I worked with Graeme Souness at Rangers. I used to make sure I was on his side in training. Hoddle believes that Jose Mourinho's actions surrounding recent incidents haven't been a good thing . MoS: You’ve all played a few Spurs-Chelsea fixtures — which ones stand out? Hazard: I remember one for Spurs in the (1982) FA Cup quarter-final when we played Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. At quarter-to-three we were stuck in traffic on Fulham Road so we were getting our gear out of the boot, dressing on the bus and then when we arrived we sprinted straight to the pitch. We were 1-0 down at half-time but came out second half and played football made in heaven. Glenn and I both scored and we won 3-2. Spurs' Micky Hazard goes past Leicester City's Eddie Kelly during a Division One match in 1980 . Hoddle: I remember being Chelsea player-manager at Stamford Bridge and being 1-0 down to Spurs. Chelsea had beaten Tottenham so many times and hadn’t been beaten by Tottenham for years. I’m thinking, ‘Oh my word, I cannot be the first manager for so many years to lose to Tottenham’. I was on the bench and I start warming up in front of the Tottenham fans, who start singing: ‘You’re Spurs and you know you are.’ That puts me under a bit of pressure — if I wave I’m damned; if I don’t wave, I’m damned. I tried to give them a sly little wave, while I was stretching. In the end, I came on and I put a cross in for Dennis Wise, who scored. That got me off the hook. I think it was a couple of situations like that which made me decide to hang my boots up at the end of the season. Hoddle in action for Tottenham at White Hart Lane against Manchester United in Division One in 1986 . MoS: Mourinho suggested recently that Eden Hazard needs more protection from officials. Obviously it was a different type of game in the Eighties. Hazard: I love to see the skill players so I don’t want to see them tackled out of existence. But if someone says today’s football is too physical it makes me laugh. Every game I was kicked. I am not sure we have the balance right today. Tackling is a skill and players should be allowed to express that skill as well. Graham Roberts was the best tackler I have ever seen — he was not nasty. He was a clever footballer and would adapt today but if he played today like he did then, even though he would take the ball he would be sent off every week! Graham Roberts (left) of Tottenham tackles Man City’s Dave Bennett in the 1981 FA Cup final . Hoddle and Hazard featured for the Tottenham side that won the 1982 FA Cup . Kerry Dixon  in action during a  Division One match against Watford at Vicarage Road in 1985 . Roberts: I don’t think the players now help themselves. I saw (Branislav) Ivanovic roll three or four times the other day and then get up — he is a brilliant player and one of the strong guys but even he’s rolling. Hoddle: The two eras are motorways away from each other in the way rules are implemented. I think that’s a good thing. I think sometimes it’s a little bit over the top, though, with all the protection. But in general I like the way the game is going. The quality of pitches and the refereeing now makes it so much easier for technical players. We’re all in different eras and if Eden Hazard had been playing then he would still have been a great player. I remember the 1981 FA Cup final, Gerry Gow was trying to put me in row Z. That’s why it’s so hard to judge Messi against Maradona, because Maradona used to get kicked from pillar to post every game. If he was playing in this era he would be even more frightening. MoS: Is this the best ever Chelsea team? Hazard: Of the players when we were playing I’d say only Kerry Dixon really would get in this side. Of course, Glenn would waltz into any team, then or now. His football was like Mozart’s music. But I don’t know if this Chelsea team is better than Jose’s first go. Roberts: Kerry Dixon scored 35 a year so I think he would get in the Chelsea side now. And no doubt that Glenn would get in. But if this isn’t the best Chelsea team then it’s close. I think overall now if they put their best 11 out they are hard for any side in the world to beat. Hoddle: With (Didier) Drogba up there in his heyday, I think that early team just shades it for me at the moment. This team might look a little more stylish. They might go on and be better than that team. They are very close now. This will be a very hard game for Spurs.

"Along with champions Manchester City and the nationwide-supported Manchester United, the DVD review of Sunderland’s season was one of the best sellers over the summer. Why? There was, of course, the escape from relegation, manager Gus Poyet describing their four wins from the final five matches as a ‘miracle’. That run included memorable victories at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford. It was also a campaign in which Sunderland completed the double over North-East rivals Newcastle for the first time since 1967. Big day out: Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the opening goal at Wembley last season in the Leugue Cup final . Memories: Poyet says his side hope to recreate the cup run from last season which inspired league survival . But amid all of that was a first cup final appearance at Wembley in 22 years. More than 40,000 fans descended on the capital for the League Cup final with Manchester City. And, despite a 3-1 defeat, it is that weekend which defined their season and triggered the record DVD sales. On Wednesday night, at Championship side Birmingham City, Sunderland begin another Capital One Cup adventure. And given the memory of that March afternoon at Wembley, Poyet will be paying this competition the utmost respect. Strong start: Sunderland picked up a point against Manchester United, and won't make many changes . ‘We will be trying to do it again (make the final),’ said the Uruguayan. ‘Normally it's one final every 20-plus years, so to do two in a row, you're asking a lot - but we will try. ‘It's incredible what people have been saying to me. They talk more about the game at Wembley that we lost, than the miracles we won. That's how much it means.’ Sunderland’s run to the final included victories over Premier League Southampton, Chelsea and Manchester United. But they also had to negotiate MK Dons and Peterborough United in the earlier rounds. And Poyet – whose side drew 1-1 with Louis van Gaal’s United in the Premier League on Sunday – will not be making sweeping changes like most top-flight managers. He went on: ‘Last year in the beginning we had some nice draws at home. I used one game against Southampton to try something different. 'Then we beat Chelsea in extra-time and we were in the semi-finals. When you're there, you take your chances. Game time: Jordi Gomez needs and deserves to play on Wednesday according to Sunderland boss Poyet . Likely to start: Billy Jones should also get a game against Birmingham after returning from injury . ‘I can promise you there are not going to be too many changes. There will be a few – there are players that need to play. Jordi Gomez needs to play and deserves to play. 'I need to play (Costel) Pantilimon as well because it's a big competition in there (the goalkeeping department). Billy Jones is back from injury and needs to play. ‘So there's going to be three or four (changes) but I'm not going to take it lightly, make 11 changes or change the system. ‘It's going to be tough, it's different, but that's the cup, it's a good thing. It's like individual finals. You need to win all the time to get through. It brings a good feeling to the team because it's a small celebration if you get through. Promising start: Winger Will Buckley impressed on the weekend and could continue in midweek . ‘I want to win, I don't want any draws. I want to get back to winning ways so we have that feeling so on Saturday we go into the game (against QPR) with a winning mentality.’ The commercial department at the Stadium of Light will be hoping Poyet is good to his word.","Sunderland reached last season's final where they lost to Manchester City .

"The cultivation of an exotic spice worth more per ounce than gold has returned to Essex for the first time in 200 years after a farmer decided to revive the centuries-old tradition of producing saffron. Farmer David Smale was inspired to start producing the spice after discovering a crocus plant in his garden, and his produce is now being sold in prestigious London grocers Fortnum & Mason and Partridges. Growing the spice was once a popular practice in Britain, but died out because the painstaking harvesting methods became too expensive to compete with cheap saffron imported from remote Iran and Kashmir. Scroll down for video . Business is blooming: Farmer David Smale has brought saffron production back to Essex for the first time in 200 years, with his Essex farm in what was the heartland of saffron growing during Tudor times . However, Mr Smale has brought the practice back to Essex, and now tends to his precious crop at a top secret location close to Saffron Walden in what was the heartland of British production in Tudor times. With a gram, 0.035 of an ounce, of the sought-after spice selling for up to £75, saffron is more expensive than gold because harvesting it is so laborious. Each crocus flower yields just three stigmas which are picked by hand by an army of volunteers then dried to create the precious saffron strands. Mr Smale, who is one of Britain’s only saffron growers, launched his business after finding success growing the crocus sativus flowers in his back garden. Growing enterprise: Mr Smale, who is Britain’s only saffron grower, launched his business after finding success growing the crocus sativus flowers in his back garden . Video courtesy of Emily Attwood . 'I’ve always wanted to grow something and one day I had a mad idea that I would grow saffron,' said the 50-year-old. 'I live in Essex and my family has a connection to Cornwall, two places that were big on saffron production centuries ago. 'I looked into who was growing saffron and to my surprise I found there was no-one doing it. 'I was told the practice had died out a few hundred years ago which I thought was ridiculous so I decided to give it a go. 'The first year I grew the crocuses in my back garden and just built my stock up from there. 'For the first few years I had some successes and some disasters but there was no-one to turn to for advice - I was learning as I went along. Production: Each crocus flower yields just three stigmas which are picked by hand by an army of volunteers then dried to create the precious saffron strands . However, it wasn’t until he found a Tudor manuscript on saffron growing in his local library that things really took off. 'The turning point came when I found a medieval text for growing saffron in the archives of the library at Saffron Walden,' he said. 'It dated back to the 1600s and confirmed everything I had learned so I knew I was doing it right. 'At first I had wanted to grow saffron just as a hobby, and so someone in Saffron Walden was growing it, but it went so well that I decided to turn my hobby into a commercial business. 'Each year we get bigger and bigger and by next season we are hoping to be able to employ people. To have that industry back in Essex after all these years is amazing.' Expensive: With a gram, 0.035 of an ounce, of the sought-after spice selling for up to £75, saffron is more expensive than gold because harvesting it is so laborious . Mr Smale runs a geophysics consultancy as well as tending to his crop of crocuses, which get planted in summer then harvested in late autumn. Tens of thousands of flowers have to be hand picked just at the right moment then dissected to remove the three red stigmas from each one. The strands are dried on racks for 24 hours then put into storage containers ready for packing. A 0.2g packet of David’s saffron sells in Fortnum & Mason for £15 and it regularly comes out top in taste tests. 'This year has been a fantastic harvest because of the hot dry summer,' he said. 'We’ve had tens of thousands of flowers to pick but you still only get about 90 grams of saffron from that. 'It sounds ridiculously small but we sell it in 0.2g packets so it goes a long way. 'Everything has to be picked by hand - you can’t mechanise it. Once you pick the flowers you then have to dissect them to get the stigmas. 'You only get three stigmas in each flower and they have to be air-dried so the work involved is huge. 'These days saffron is more associated with exotic locations like Iran, Morocco and Spain but in the past English saffron has been by reputation the best in the world. 'Ours certainly comes out top in taste tests. It’s sweeter and more honey-like than other varieties and I think that’s down to the nutrients in the soil. 'We’re lucky that there’s a food revolution at the moment and people are prepared to pay a little bit more for quality produce made locally. Such is the success of his company, English Saffron, that David is looking to upscale his output by 20 times next season. He added: 'We moved into a new field this year which will become our centre for processing and we’re looking to take on another field next season. 'We’re talking about increasing our size dramatically by about 20 times. 'Saffron Walden was one of the world’s major producers of saffron a few centuries ago and we’re happy to be doing our bit to keep the tradition alive.'","David Smale started producing the spice after finding a crocus in his garden .

"Supporters of the St Louis policeman who killed a black teenager have rallied in the city in the first public show of support for the officer. At the rally, attended by around 150 people, protesters walked around wearing specially printed T-shirts which were sold for $7 with a police shield on which was the words: ‘I stand by Darren Wilson’. Instead of a badge number it read 8.9.14 - the day he killed 18-year-old Michael Brown. Two Facebook pages in support of Wilson, 28, have also sprung up with a combined total of 35,000 likes. Supporters: More than a hundred people gathered on Sunday to support St Louis, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson, who shot dead black teen Michael Brown earlier this month in Ferguson . Critics: The rally happened outside the officers of news station KSDK in St Louis, Missouri. Many of those rallying today criticized the news station for spreading information about Wilson's address . Incident: Officer Darren Wilson (left) shot dead Michael Brown (right) on August 9, and witnesses say Brown had his hands up in surrender at the time . Supporters have also set up a GoFundMe site for raising money for Wilson which raised $1,500 towards a goal of $5,000 to pay for his legal fees in just two hours. Witnesses claim that Wilson, a six year veteran with the police in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, killed Brown even though he was unarmed and had his hands in the air. The rally on Sunday afternoon was called on the steps on St Louis TV station KDSK because Wilson’s supporters were unhappy they had broadcast details about Wilson’s home. Speaking out: Many of the protesters were people who work or have worked in law enforcement, or have relatives who are police officers . Bias: Many of the protesters believe the media coverage of the incident has been biased against the police officer involved . Over: The group dispersed peacefully around 7pm . A handful of Brown’s supporters stood on the other side of the road holding up signs which read: ‘Killer Cops: Don’t Shoot’ and ‘Ferguson Police are harboring a fugitive’. The pro-Wilson side of the road was made up largely of people who work or have worked in law enforcement, or relatives of police officers. John Newsham, 55, a retired St Louis County police detective, said: ‘The coverage so far has been biased and against the officer. ‘They can make it a black white thing, but it’s not. It should be about the rule of law’. During the rally the protesters passed around a giant card on which they wrote messages like: ‘Stay Strong’ and ‘The Blue Line Forever’. Opposition: The demonstration on Sunday attracted more protesters who set up camp across the street to rally in favor of victim Michael Brown . Not in agreement: Protesters hold up their signs in response to the demonstration for Darren Wilson . They also cheered every time somebody honked their horn as they drove past as a gesture of support. The wife of a St Louis County policeman told MailOnline that she was angry because officers has been deployed to cope with the protests which put other units under strain. This meant her husband had been working 12 hour days and an 100 hour week which left her with no support to look after their four children. With school starting this week and their daughter going to college, it was hard to cope when her husband was exhausted. Todd Brayfied, 34, a pipe repairer, said: ‘I think that he’s (Wilson) been tried and convicted of being a murderer. Incensed: The community in Ferguson has been protested in outrage over Brown's death. Above demonstrators pictured talking to Capt Ronald Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol on Sunday, August 17 . ‘I’ve seen 15 different eyewitnesses and they have 15 different accounts. Bits and pieces match up but they are not the same.’ Martin Baker, 44, a consultant, said: ‘I come here to support Darren and support both sides of the story. ‘I have respect for the police. Here in America we are a society of law and order. You must maintain law and order or you will become a community that is reckless and doesn’t care’. The two Facebook pages are I Support Darren Wilson and Support Darren Wilson, which organized the protest. The woman who had organized the protest said that she did it as a ‘show of support for Darren’. She declined to give her name. The crowd quietly dispersed at 7pm.","The large group gathered outside of the St Louis offices of news station KSDK on Sunday .

"Special delivery: Angus McDonagh claims he has sent letters all over the world for free by making his own DIY stamps . An architect has been sending letters for free using DIY stamps featuring his own face. Angus McDonagh, 64, claims he has duped Royal Mail with over a hundred of his bizarre designs on letters which have been posted all over the world. Many have his own face where the Queen’s traditional side profile would sit - complete with a comic eye patch or curious hat. At Christmas he created some of himself with a white Santa beard while others have used family photos. Mr McDonagh, an architect who describes himself an ‘anarchist philatelist’, began his personal freepost system three years ago in protest at bland stamp design. He objected to what he felt was a decline in the design and detail of official Royal Mail stamps and the demise of posted letters because of email. Mr McDonagh said: 'When I started I wanted them to be deliberately silly, so I had a fake moustache or beard or eye patch, that was very obviously drawn on very crudely. 'I started it as a bit of a protest. It seemed as if stamps were disappearing due to everyone going online all the time. 'The Queen’s head, it seemed to me, was going to disappear from stamps and be replaced with lots of other images and I felt I had to act. 'I just kept going and it has become more and more farcical. It’s gone undetected for so long now it is just silly.'Mr McDonagh has created 50 individual stamp designs, printed them on his home computer and stuck them to envelopes with glue. All stamps have a fake value of 50c - his own invented currency - and are franked with a location mark by Mr McDonagh before he posts them. He makes special edition stamps, but instead of commemorating real life events they celebrate his own fantasy occasions such as ‘Upside Down Day’. One stamp is simply a black and white snap of him as a six-year-old boy, while another is a sweetly-posed portrait of him and partner Jo Purvis, 52. Fakes: Mr McDonagh has created 50 individual homemade stamps which include images of his own face. He claims Royal Mail staff have failed to spot his stamps are fake for more than three years . Imitations: Mr McDonagh often adds fake glasses, mustaches and hats to his DIY stamps . He has successfully sent over 100 . letters to France, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada and Italy - as well as . all over the UK - and only one has ever been detected as a counterfeit. Mr McDonagh, of Bridgwater, Somerset, claims he never meant to evade payment and has even tried to send Royal Mail a number of cheques for the total costs, but they were all returned. He said: 'I’m actually a great fan of Royal Mail. I think the local postmen in our rural community are very important people who do a great job. 'But Royal Mail has been sold for many billions of pounds when it seems to me that the system in place just doesn’t work. 'I have records of everything I have sent with my own stamps. 'The critical thing is I have never intended to defraud the Post Office from any money.

"Roy Keane has pulled out of his role as an ITV World Cup pundit just two weeks before the tournament gets underway. The former footballer, 42, is believed to be closing in on a deal to become assistant manager at Aston Villa, and has decided to put his media duties on hold to concentrate on his coaching career. It is not the first time Keane has failed to take part in a World Cup at the last minute. He was famously sent home from Ireland's squad during the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea following a public row with manager Mick McCarthy. Ruled out: Roy Keane (left) used a public appearance with Ireland manager Martin O'Neil (right) to reveal that he has pulled out of his role as an ITV pundit for the World Cup . Popular: Keane has earned rave reviews for his honest approach during ITV's coverage of the Champions League and England matches and was due to travel to Brazil for the World Cup . Although the former . Manchester United midfielder turned down a job as manager of Scottish . Premier League champions Celtic last week, he is believed to be ready to . take a job at Aston Villa. Announcing . his departure from ITV, a spokesperson said: 'Roy has been a tremendous . part of our pundit team in recent years, but we fully understand his . decision to concentrate wholly on his coaching. We wish him every . success for the future.' Keane has been a regular pundit for ITV's Champions League and England coverage in recent years, winning plaudits for his straight-talking and honest approach.

But during an appearance with O'Neill at an event in London, Keane confirmed he will not travel to Brazil for the World Cup. Keane had been expected to be appointed . as Neil Lennon’s successor at Scottish champions Celtic.

The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your b*******.' Unsurprisingly he was sent home by his manager. The general public in Ireland was divided about apportioning blame for the incident, with many agreeing that the side's preparations for the tournament were below par.

"Eidur Gudjohnsen is aiming to turn back the clock and thrill Bolton fans again after the 36-year-old returned 'home' 14 years since he last played for Wanderers. The veteran Icelander is back at the club he first joined in 1998, aiming to experience a late-career renaissance having returned to these shores following short stints with Tottenham, Stoke and Fulham. Gudjohnsen embarked on an upward trajectory when he left Bolton in 2000, enjoying trophy-laden spells at Chelsea and Barcelona, but he has failed to settle since despite playing in France, England, Greece and Belgium. Eidur Gudjohnsen looked delighted to be back at Bolton Wanderers when unveiled on Tuesday afternoon . New Bolton singing Gudjohnsen watched on from the stands as his new side faced Reading . Gudjohnsen played for Bolton's Under 21s against Middlesbrough last Monday before signing a deal . Yet the forward, who last Friday penned a deal with Bolton until the end of the season, is optimistic he can rekindle some of the old magic now he is back in familiar surroundings at the Macron Stadium. 'Injuries came into play and in certain situations in the latter stages of my career I've found it difficult at times to settle in at clubs that I've been to,' he said. 'Whether it's been adapting to the style of play, or the surroundings - it just hasn't worked out at times. 'I feel like I've been here for a couple of years already because it feels like home. 'Now it's just a matter of me being hard on myself in the next few weeks and being as ready as I can when called upon.' Gudjohnsen, who needs international clearance before he can make his debut, is realistic enough to acknowledge he will not be the same player who helped Bolton reach two play-off campaigns and FA Cup and League Cup semi-finals during his two-year spell. Gudjohnsen during his first spell at Bolton before he left the club for Chelsea . But he does believe that a career which has seen him play under the likes of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola will give him an edge in the second tier. 'Last time I was here I was a young boy with very fresh legs and now in footballing terms I'm probably an old man,' he noted. 'It will be more playing on experience, trying to read situations before anyone else and the mind just has to make sure that the legs and body will follow.' Gudjohnsen may not be the only veteran player to join Bolton's ranks out of the transfer window either, with ex-England forward Emile Heskey, also 36, training with Neil Lennon's men as Wanderers assess whether the free agent is worthy of a similar short-term deal. Lennon's other attacking options lack experience and the duo of Gudjohnsen and Heskey have 140 international caps between them. The Iceland forward played for Wanderers between 1998 and 2000 and was a fans' favourite . 'And about 100 years together as well,' Gudjohnsen joked. 'He's a physical presence and you can still see it; there's not much changed in him. If he wants to play and if he's hungry to play then I'd love for him to be with us. 'Any bit of quality, any bit of experience, any bit of competition within the group is always helpful and whether it's him or other players, we want to find a healthy competition to get the best out of each other.'","Eidur Gudjohnsen had been a free agent since the summer .

The government that asked for the . investigation was not identified but security experts have speculated that Russia could have issued the request, based on fears . that Tamerlan had links to Chechen extremists. Based on FBI procedure, it is likely investigators performed a background check on Tamerlan and discussed his behavior and international travel with other agencies. CBS News believes officials would have called Tamerlan in for a sit-down interview and their findings would have been compiled into a report and sent to the requesting government. Federal authorities determined that there were no conclusive links between Tamerlan and any extremist groups. After the deadly attacks on Monday in . Boston, the FBI released surveillance footage of the two suspects they . believe were responsible for the blasts.

"Two brothers who found the remains of the plane flown by their grandfather in the First World War have spent 12 years restoring it to working order. David and Rick Bremner from Milson, Shropshire, have scoured the globe looking for parts to rebuild the Bristol Scout Type-C plane once piloted by their grandfather, Francis Donald Holden Bremner. The pair have spent out over £100,000 since they found three small parts  in his shed following his death in 1983 and have finally completed the reconstruction this week. The rebuilt Bristol Scout Type C airfcraft, which was flown between 1914 and 1916 by David and Rick Bremner's grandfather Francis . Their grandfather Francis Donald Holden Bremner in Thasos in 1916 with one of the seven Bristol Scout Type C biplane he flew . Flight sub-lieutenant Francis Donald Holden Bremner (left), in 1915, and his grandson David Bremner (right), 63, who took on the task . Flight Sub Lieutenant Bremner had flown the plane between 1914 and 1918 while serving with the Royal Naval Air Service during the Gallipoli campaign. On his return from battle the war hero had always told his family he would like to see the aircraft take to the skies once again. To honour their late grandfather's wishes David, 63, and Rick, 61, along with friend and amateur pilot Theo Willford, 66, began looking for the other components that would complete the aircraft. Starting with just a joystick, rudder bar and magneto - an electrical generator which uses magnets - found in the shed the trio have travelled the world looking for the rest of the parts - many no longer in existence - including the engine, which was purchased in New Zealand. After a staggering 10,000 hours of building the plane from scratch, this week they put the final touches to the aircraft, which has a wingspan of 24ft and is 20ft in length. It is due to take the skies in spring next year and the trio plan to fly it over the River Somme on July 1, 2016, marking exactly 100 years since the fateful day in 1916 when almost 20,000 British soldiers lost their lives in France. Rick Bremner (left), friend Theo Willford (centre) and David Bremner (right) spent 12 years rebuilding the First World War fighter plane . Theo Willford lays out the wing structure during its restoration (left) and the grip of the plane's joystick which had to be repaired (right) Some of the plane's original parts, including the stick, rubber and magneto (left), which David (right) found after his grandfather's death . The trio are celebrating this week after completing the restoration of the plane and plan to take it to the skies for the first time in spring . It will be the only flyable Bristol Scout Type-C anywhere in the world when it finally takes off. David, who works as a mechanical engineer and is chairman of the British Microlight Aircraft Association, said he believed his grandfather would be proud. He said: 'We grew up less than 10 miles from my grandfather in Kent so we heard all his war stories. 'Although he talked about flying a lot he had never mentioned keeping these parts before. 'When we found them we knew they belonged to his favourite plane because the magneto was made by Bosch, the German company. 'Back in those days it was very hard to get German parts obviously, but my grandfather had told us the story of how he traded a few bombs and some food to a French base in return for the Bosch magneto. 'So these parts came from that plane and it would make sense that he would keep hold of them because it was his favourite aircraft he had flown. 'He said one day he would like to see it fly again over British skies.' The brother's have spent over £10,000 on the plane and wanted to rebuilt it as a tribute to their grandfather who died in 1983 . The aircraft will be the only flyable Bristol Scout Type-C anywhere in the world when it finally takes off. David is pictured with his wife Susan Bremner and the plane, which he says his grandfather would have been 'proud' of . These three pieces of the plane were discovered when David and his father, Ian, 91, were clearing out Francis' workshop, following his death in 1983. They quickly realised they had found the part which provides a spark for the engine, from the pilot's beloved No.1264 aircraft. But it was not until Mr Willford, a fellow amateur pilot, encouraged the family to start rebuilding the plane that the project came about. In 2002, the trio began researching where they could find appropriate parts to start rebuilding the plane before work began in 2010. David, a grandfather-of-two, added: 'We had the parts for years and had the idea in the back of our minds that one day we would try to rebuild the plane. 'But it was Theo who actually got us to make a start. 'We started researching what the plane would look like and because the parts don't exist anymore we had to plan what replacements we could still get now. 'The three original bits we had only probably made up about two per cent of the whole thing, so there was so much left to do. 'The only thing we didn't make ourselves was the engine, which we got from a New Zealand-based company and it's is an actual 1917 engine in a beautiful condition. One of the Bristol Scouts crashed on the island of Imbros in Turkey, which is now officially known as Gökçeada, in March 1916 . 'The aircraft is pretty much finished now apart from the petrol tank and the fabric covering the fuselage. 'Rick and I live in Shropshire but Theo lives in Dorset, so we took small things down to him and then brought them back in a trailer when he was working on it. 'I think our grandfather would be proud of us re-building his favourite plane, but he'd probably say we've spent far too much time and money on it as well.' Sub-lieutenant Holden, nicknamed 'Bunnie' because he was always twitching his nose, was in active service between, throughout the whole of the First World War. After the war he worked as a patents engineer in Brasted, Kent and lived with his wife Vivyen, and two sons, Christopher, and Ian - Rick and David's father. During 1916, Officer Holden had been stationed on the islands of Imbros and Thasos in the Aegean Sea as part of the Royal Naval Air Service, and flew seven Bristol Scout Type-C planes. His favourite plane of the seven had Serial No. 1264 and he kept three small parts of that aircraft in his workshop until he died aged 89. Rick, a builder and father-of-two from Tenbury Wells, added: 'It's been a huge privilege to be part of this project. It's just fantastic. 'We all just wish my grandfather was here to answer a lot of questions we have about details of the plane, because he could have told us straight away. 'We have old photos of what the plane should look like, but when you try to zoom in to look a specific details, it's too grainy to make out. 'But fortunately we got there in the end - its been a long old labour of love but it's been worth it. 'I think its a fitting tribute to my grandad and other British pilots who battled so valiantly for us during the Great War.' Flight sub-lieutenant Francis Bremner, nicknamed 'Bunnie' can be seen in the seat of the Bristol Scout on Thasos, Greece, in June 1916 . This is the map that Francis Bremner used to fly 89 miles across water from Imbors to Thasos. Most if it was out of sight with no radio and an unreliable compass . The Bristol Scout was a single-engine, single-seat fighter intended to supply ground commanders with an advantageous 'eye in the sky'. The initial prototype, Scout A, was unveiled in 1913 with a top speed of 100 miles per hour, a service ceiling of 14,000 feet and an endurance of 2.5 hours. Its design was regarded as very streamlined and consisted of a well-contoured fuselage with the single rotary piston engine set to the front and a conventional tail to the rear. The engine powered a two-bladed wooden propeller and the open air cockpit was held just under and aft of the upper wing assembly with generally adequate views. The Scout B was established as an early militarised form and led to the development of the Scout C – which was the one flown by the Bremner's grandfather. Type C aircraft was first ordered by the British government on November 5, 1914, in a 12 aircraft production batch for the Royal Flying Corps. In was later commissioned by the competing Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in a 24-aircraft batch and its first combat was in February 1915. It was armed with a standardised mounting and a 7.7mm Lewis machine gun along the left side of the fuselage away from the spinning propeller arc. Some were also finished with their guns fielded across the upper wing assembly. Its targets ranged from enemy aircraft (patrol, escort, interception), bombers, observation balloons, ground-based 'targets of opportunity' and even Zeppelins, which regularly patrolled airspaces. The C type Scout was followed by Scout D in November 1915, when 210 aircraft were produced.

"John Cusack has unleashed an attack on the ageism and misogyny that surrounds today's Hollywood film industry, speaking out in defense of the treatment of women and a system that 'eats young actors and spits them out'. The 48-year-old actor candidly admitted that, as a man, he has '15, 20 years before they say I'm old'. But while promoting his latest film Maps To The Stars - a damning account of celebrity culture in LA - Cusack said actresses are considered 'menopausal at 26', and that the industry is constantly looking to 'open up another can of hot 22' for the sake of cinema capital. 'It's becoming almost like kiddie porn. It's f---ing weird,' he told The Guardian. 'It's a whorehouse and people go mad. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scathing: John Cusack, 48, said Hollywood is a 'whorehouse' full of 'crazies' and 'you couldn't make it up' 'I have actress friends who are being put out to pasture at 29. They just want to open up another can of hot 22.' When he was starting out at 16 in 1982, Cusack said he was mentored and protected by industry heavyweights such as Al Pacino as he went on to star in films such as High Fidelity and Grosse Point Blank. 'People would look after you when I was a kid,' he said. 'There were good people in the business. 'Now it's different. 'The culture just eats young actors up and spits them out.' His words come days before Maps To The Stars hits US cinemas. The satirical drama, directed by David Cronenberg, gives a dark and scathing account of celebrity culture as it follows an archetypal Hollywood dynasty - two former child stars, a psychotherapist father and a pushy momager. 'Close to the truth': He stars as a fad therapist in soon-to-be-released Maps To The Stars (pictured) alongside Julianne Moore who plays a fading actress. Cusack claims the satirical drama is very close to the truth . Damning: Cusack (pictured in a shot from the movie) said he was mentored and protected by people like Al Pacino but warns young actors today to shelter from the movie capital which 'eats you up and spits you out' Cusack plays a 'life-coach' who invented a fad therapy that has become a hit with A-listers, alongside an all-star cast. Julianne Moore plays his client, an ageing and disturbed forty-something actress desperately vying for a new part, in a performance critics are hailing as a career-best. Robert Pattinson portrays a limousine driver and aspiring actor, and Mia Wazikowska plays a badly burned pyromaniac. The characters are a mess of psychological issues. A 26-year-old woman is described as 'menopausal' in the film. And Cusack claims it is not far from the true demographic of Hollywood inhabitants. He says the mega-corporation-dominated industry has turned it into an ideal rather than a place, leaving actors lost and confused. Defending his own role in the movie world, he says he make some commercial films to fund projects he cares about. Blockbuster star: Cusack is best known for his role as record shop owner Rob in the 2000 film High Fidelity . Action movie hit: Grosse Point Blank is a dark and eccentric 1997 comedy about a hit man and his love life . Star siblings: John's sister Joan Cusack (right), also an actor, has been just as vocal about her feelings of Hollywood in the past, calling it a 'terrible world' 'For women it’s brutal,' he told The Guardian. 'Bruce’s thing about if you’re 26, you’re menopausal? 'It’s only absurd because it’s a little bit further than the truth.' John's sister, two-time Oscar-nominee Joan Cusack, has spoken in similar terms in the past on her own take on Hollywood. The Working Girl star said she would never want her two sons to become actors. 'If you weren't manic depressive when you started out as an actor, there's a strong chance you'd end up that way being surrounded by all the wrong values,' she told creators.com. 'The fantasy and illusion of wanting to be a movie star is gruesome. 'It's a terrible world, a terrible business, and it takes its toll.'","The 48-year-old actor has enjoyed a 25-year career in Hollywood .

'The aim of the poster series is to encourage victims to report their cases in order for the authorities to prevent it from happening again,' the artist, who is based in the Middle East, told MailOnline. Powerful message: Artist Saint Hoax aims to encourage young victims of incest and sexual abuse to report their attacks, with posters including this one, which shows Ariel from The Little Mermaid kissing her father . The impactful posters see three iconic Disney characters - Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, Ariel from The Little Mermaid, and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin - engaged in uncomfortable lip-locks with their fathers. 'I recently learned that one of my closest friends was molested by her father when she was seven,' Saint Hoax explains. 'It took her 14 years to be able to share that traumatizing experience, and that story shocked me to my core.' He goes on: 'As an artist and activist, I decided to shed light on that topic again in a new form. I used Disney princess because it's a visual language that my targeted audience would be attracted to.' Relatable character? The artist says he cast Disney princesses for his campaign because 'it's a visual language that my targeted audience would be attracted to' Saint Hoax says that before going public with the campaign, he tried reaching out to a major organization he hoped might use it for good, but never heard back. So he published the work on his own, after which a number of other foundations which fight child sexual abuse and incest shared the images. The project has sparked mixed responses. One commenter from Jezebel's site wrote:  '[Children] now get to have a favorite cartoon, childhood escapism, associated with incest.' Another wrote: 'Creepy and disturbing without being actually helpful.' But others see it differently, with one supporter musing: 'Choosing Disney princesses for this campaign actually makes a lot of sense... Because of the familiarity of the characters (in both senses of the word), these images are creepy and uncomfortable, which is exactly what they need to be.' Twist: In the original version of Sleeping Beauty, written in the 16th century, the princess is actually raped by a King during her 100 year slumber, unbeknownst to most Disney fans . Saint Hoax says that today, just one day after publishing the posters, they have already made a monumental difference to at least one girl. 'I received an email from a girl thanking me for the project and telling me that she decided to report her father after seeing the posters. I actually cried,' he reveals. 'You have no idea how glad I am now that I actually published the series. If the posters could change one person's life, then it's worth it.' Interestingly, one of the Disney characters he used for the campaign turns out to be a more salient choice than he previously knew. '[One girl] told me that she decided to report . her father after seeing the posters. I actually cried' In the original story of Sleeping Beauty, which was written in the 16th Century, the princess isn't woken by the kiss from a prince at all. While she is asleep, a passing King rapes her and she subsequently births twins. The princess is actually awoken by one of her children, finding herself in a decidedly different predicament than she does in later versions of the story. Saint Hoax is based in the Middle East, and works under a pseudonym to protect himself and his provocative campaigns, in a region which enforces strict censorship. His previous work has seen cartoon characters from Aladdin appearing on 'denied' visa applications from the UK, as well as representations of political figures; including Barak Obama as Natalie Portman's Black Swan character and Kim Jong Un as Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland. He says he received 'a lot of threats' after he produced an image of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in drag.Saint Hoax describes his work broadly as: 'Combining pop art with tyrants and world leaders.'","Artist Saint Hoax created the posters after learning that his friend had been molested by her father at aged seven .
One victim of incest has already been moved to report her attack after seeing the campaign ."
"Accused: Sarah Beth Hopkins was arrested on Sunday and her bail was set at $1million . A 35-year-old woman has been charged with 20 counts of rape and sodomy after she allegedly had an eight-month sexual relationship with an 11-year-old boy, it emerged today. Sarah Beth Hopkins, from Salem, was arrested on Sunday after the parents of her alleged victim reported her to police. The boy, now 12, confessed to his mother he had been sexually active with Hopkins for the last eight months. When Hopkins was confronted she allegedly admitted the sexual abuse. The family lived at the same apartment complex as Hopkins - who was seen as a trusted family friend - until about two weeks ago, according to KGW. The mother became suspicious of their close friendship and the amount of time they spent together. The abuse is thought to have taken place at her apartment and while they were out on long walks together. Police believe there may be more victims. Marion County Sheriff's Office spokesman Don Thomson said: 'The boy confirmed that he, in fact, had been involved in this relationship with this 35-year-old woman. Family friend: When questioned by the deputy, Hopkins allegedly . admitted she and the victim had been sexually active but said she hadn't . threatened the victim or given him anything in return for sex .

Make sure everything’s okay.' When questioned by the deputy, Hopkins is believed to have admitted she and the victim had been sexually active but said she hadn't threatened the victim or given him anything in return for sex. Hopkins' Facebook page includes many suggestive photos of herself, and some along with young boys, along with links to a few different teen websites. Marion County Circuit Judge Donald Abar read her charges in court yesterday: Three counts of rape in the first degree, seven counts of rape in the second degree, two counts of sodomy in the first degree and eight counts of sodomy in the second degree. Her bail was set at $1million.","Sarah Beth Hopkins has been charged with 20 counts of rape and sodomy .

"Former United States child prodigy Freddy Adu will start a trial with AZ Alkmaar on Monday having been without a club since an unsuccessful spell with Brazilian side Bahia in 2013. The 25-year-old attacker was a member of USA's 2008 Olympics team, but he has never fulfilled the potential that saw him burst on to the global scene when he signed for Major League Soccer side DC United at the age of 14 in 2004. The Dutch club announced the trial on their website on Sunday, with a message saying they hoped the success of former AZ star and Adu's old USA Under-20 team-mate Jozy Altidore would inspire him to new heights. Great expectations: So much was expected of Adu when he signed an MLS contract at the age of 14 . World at his feet: Adu dribbles past Argentina internationals Ever Banega and Fernando Gago in 2008 . Adu, the only player to score hat-tricks in the Under-17 World Championships and at an Under-20 World Cup, played with Altidore at youth level, and even set up both of his goals in a 2-1 win against Brazil at the Under-20 World Cup in 2007. Despite his clear promise, Adu has never lived up to the hype that saw him labelled 'the next Pele', and though he has been capped 17 times for USA his club career has since him travel between continents in search of regular football. Playing against the best: Adu jostles for possession with Real Madrid and Brazil legend Roberto Carlos . International: Adu controls the ball during a World Cup qualifier against Guatemala in Colorado . In 2006 he moved to Real Salt Lake, before Portuguese giants Benfica signed him a year later. He dabbled in Ligue 1 after failing to hold down a first-team spot in Lisbon, joining Monaco on loan for the 2008/09 season. The next season he was back in Portugal with Belenenses, before he moved to Greek side Aris in January 2010. Thirteen months after that he joined Turkey's Caykur Rizespor, but that spell was short-lived and he returned to the US half a year later. Eagle: Adu celebrates scoring for Benfica against Maritimo during a league match in 2007 . Adu finally appeared to be settled after spending two years at MLS side Philadelphia Union, only to suddenly join Bahia in April 2013. He was released by Bahia in November and had trials with Blackpool in February and in June former US boss Bob Bradley offered him a chance at Norwegian side Stabaek. Adu failed to impress Bradley enough to secure a long-term deal, which has led to his latest trial, at Eredivisie's AZ Alkmaar. Seemingly settled: Adu spent two years at Philadelphia Union before jumping ship to try his luck in Brazil .","Adu signed for DC United in 2004 but has never lived up to his potential .
The attacker has plied his trade at nine clubs in Europe, South America and North America, since making his debut in 2004 .

"This heartwarming video shows the moment two dogs were rescued from a lake in Dej, Romania, by volunteers from an animal protection group. The rescuers were alerted to the dogs' plight by locals living nearby. The strays had been stuck in the lake for 48 hours after somebody threw them in - a concrete wall around the lake appears to have prevented them from jumping out. Abandoned: The dogs had been stuck in the shallow lake for 48 hours after somebody threw them in . The two-minute clip shows one of the dogs wading through the shallow water as the rescuers try to get its attention. A man then climbs down into the lake and slowly makes his way over to the dog, which is now cowering next to its frightened companion among some reeds. After slipping a collar around its neck, the rescuer uses a lead to haul the first dog out of the lake with the help of two volunteers waiting by the shore. After pausing to shake itself dry, the timid canine runs off down the road. Trapped: A concrete wall around the lake appears to have prevented the dogs from jumping out . Coming to the rescue: The video shows one of the volunteers climbing down into the water . Leading the way: The man slips a collar over the dog's neck in order to pull him over to the wall . The man then returns to the second dog, coaxing it over to the wall and passing the lead to his fellow rescuers who lift it out of the water. As soon as the collar is unclipped, it runs off in search of its companion. Last year, hundreds of dog lovers blockaded Romania's Parliament in protest after the country's constitutional court upheld a law allowing strays to be euthanised. The ruling came weeks after a four-year-old boy's fatal mauling in the Romanian capital led the government to draft the legislation. Home and dry: He then lifts the dog out of the lake with the help of two other rescuers . Helping hand: The man returns to rescue the second dog, which is cowering among some reeds . The second dog is also hauled out of the water before it runs off down the street in search of its companion . Under the new law, stray dogs will be taken to shelters and - if not adopted or claimed within 14 days - they will be killed. The World Society for the Protection of Animals criticised the ruling and called the bill 'both inhumane and ineffective'. According to official estimates, there are three million stray dogs roaming Romania’s streets - 65,000 of which live in the country’s capital, Bucharest.","The dogs had been stuck in the lake for 48 hours after being thrown in .

"An animal lover is raising money to help a Romanian dog get life-changing fake limbs after he was found wandering the countryside on stumps as somebody had cut off his two front legs. Colin the dog had been cruelly mistreated by its previous owner when it was discovered by Romanian animal welfare activist Diana Neacsu who contacted her friend Claire Revis who launched the ambitious rescue mission. Ms Revis organised transport for Colin from Valcea in Romania to Brighouse, West Yorkshire where he will be fitted with his new limbs. Scroll down for video . Colin is recovering from his injuries after being rescued by Claire Revis in Brighouse West Yorkshire . Colin, pictured, will require more surgery on his front legs before he can be fitted with prosthetic legs from the United States . According to Ms Revis, Colin is able to walk on his stumps but he will be far happier when fitted with his new legs . According to Ms Revis, the dog had suffered the terrible injuries several months before he was discovered. The 48-year-old former pub landlady from Brighouse, West Yorks said she managed to bring Colin to the UK after raising more than £6,000 for his treatment. He was transported almost 1,700 miles from Romania to Essex, where Ms Revis picked him up and drove the final part of the trip to West Yorkshire. Initially, it was hoped that £5,000 would cover Colin's medical bills but he has required a longer stay in the vet and additional surgery, pushing the total bill towards £10,000. Colin the dog recovering from surgery on his two front legs after being mistreated in Valcea, Romania . Colin traveled almost 1,700 miles from Valcea in Romania to Brighouse, West Yorkshire . However, he will soon be fitted with his £3,000 prosthetic legs which have been specially flown in from the United States. She said: 'He was found in a horrendous state, he'd been walking on bare bones, the skin on his two front legs had come off and he had a lot of  infection. 'He'd probably lost them months before, the vets said they'd been chopped off  deliberately.' According to Ms Revis: 'They have very limited vet facilities out there, and most of them are totally unsanitary. Luckily my friend knew of one in Bacau that was good. 'There he was cleaned up and given antibiotics, we spoke to a company called Orthopets who organise for limb reconstuction in badly injured animals.' Due to the severity of his injury, Colin is undergoing additional surgery to further trim his front legs to ensure that the prothetics will be a success. 'We hoped he wouldn't need any more surgery but we have to cut back the bone to allow enough skin to cover the stump. The stitches have to be on the side so they don't rub on the new legs.' The new limbs feature a cone which slides over the remaining stumps allowing Colin to walk once again. When Colin the dog was rescued two bones were protruding through the skin at the bottom of his stumps . After his wounds were cleared and the infection was treated, Colin the dog soon perked up . Colin has one more bout of surgery before he can be fitted with his new prosthetic legs . The new limbs have been ordered from the United States and will be fitted once Colin recovers from his latest bout of surgery. According to Ms Revis: 'It's so rewarding to see dogs that have been mistreated rehomed to loving families. It will take two or three weeks after he's fitted with the artificial legs for him to get used to it, just because he won't know what's going on.' Ms Revis said Colin's injuries were caused by someone who deliberately cut off his front legs. 'I asked the vet whether he might have been caught in a trap but he said the injuries were level and looked deliberate. If he had been caught in a trap the injuries would have been different. 'I cannot understand why someone would want to do that to a dog. But animal cruelty is a major problem out in Romania. I want Colin to be a poster boy to highlight the issue and hopefully there will be no more Colins in future. 'There are dead dogs on every street in Bucharest, some tie wire around their necks and drag them around for pleasure. You'd be arrested over here for doing that. 'I have rescued a dog from over there before who had her entire face cut off with a machete, she was supposed to be a Border Collie but the new family thought she was a pug because of her injuries. I can't imagine how anyone could be so cruel.' According to Claire Revis, right, animal cruelty is quite common in Romania and she wants Colin, left, to be a 'poster boy' to highlight the issue . Added Ms Revis: 'Colin has had all his injections now, which he needed for coming to the UK after he had been living in the dirt with open wounds. 'There are about 100,000 stray dogs in Bucharest alone, but dog shelters just seem to pocket the money. Very few are actually given any food or medical care. 'Then there is the cruelty - people just go round the streets beating, maiming and even poisoning them. It's an act of power that people abuse, the poor dogs are completely defenceless. 'People have donated from all over the world to see him come over and get rehomed - I've been so overwhelmed by the whole thing. 'It's really restored my faith in humans.' Colin the dog has received money from well-wishers around the globe who want to see him back on his feet .","Cruel attackers in Valcea, Romania chopped off Colin's front legs .

"Deborah Carrigan, pictured, was caught stealing cash from an elderly dementia patient's handbag on a CCTV camera installed by the victim's family . A carer was recorded stealing cash from a 92-year-old dementia patient’s purse by a hidden camera set up by the pensioner’s son, the Old Bailey heard. Deborah Carrigan, 43, was filmed taking bank notes and coins from the purse of Ada Berlin during lunchtime visits. The care assistant then wiped down the purse for fingerprints while making sure Mrs Berlin was not looking. But the pensioner’s son had set up a hidden camera to catch the thief after noticing his mother’s money disappearing faster than normal. Carrigan, who had ran up debts of £10,000, admitted four counts of theft by abuse of position and was spared jail by the judge, Mr Recorder Sir Geoffrey Nice QC. ‘This was a breach of trust which is more serious because of the vulnerability of the woman you were caring for’, he said. ‘The film shows you were quite alive to the risk of detection. ‘You feared some had caught you and you carried on doing it. ‘The sums you took were small but you were clearly quite determined to pursue on with it.’ Carrigan, from Croydon, was caught out in August last year when secretly recorded taking £75 from Mrs Berlin’s purse in four separate raids. ‘The son would provide his mother with cash, and he was often surprised at how much money his mother got through’, said prosecutor Henry Gordon. ‘He was suspicious money was being taken from her, so on August 3 he set up a covert camera in the kitchen where his mother’s purse was located. ‘He placed a quantity of bank note in the purse.’ Mr Gordon said he collected the footage two days later and saw Carrigan stealing during one of her regular lunchtime visits. ‘She entered the kitchen, looking over her shoulder to where the mother was sitting’, he said. ‘She opened the purse and was seen to take out one bank note and several coins. ‘She was seen to go over to the sink to wipe down the purse, and the money was placed in the defendant’s right pocket.’ Carrigan, who was employed as a carer by Allied Healthcare, visited Mrs Berlin’s home in Caterham, Surrey, each lunchtime. The Old Bailey heard that Carrigan wiped down her fingerprints from her victim's purse after taking the cash . The pensioner was suffering from dementia and memory loss, and received three visits a day from different carers, the court heard. Carrigan was caught out again in footage collected on August 15 last year using a tea towel to hold the purse while she swiped some cash. The camera caught her repeating the thefts twice more, on August 16 and 17, before Mrs Berlin’s family called police. ‘She said she hadn’t done it and said the elderly lady asked her to buy incontinence pads and E45 cream’, said Mr Gordon. ‘She said she always provided the elderly lady with the change and receipts.’ Carrigan tried to claim she had wiped down the purse due to OCD tendencies, but ‘her account was rebutted by the daughter in law who says she is the one tasked with buying incontinence pads.’ The carer finally confessed when the case was brought to trial, the court heard. James Hasslacher, defending, said Carrigan is now working as a bar maid in Wetherspoons but fears she will now lose that job due to her conviction. He added she has been the subject of an anonymous Facebook campaign against her as a result of the thefts. She was given a three months prison sentence suspended for two years, and ordered to complete 12 months of supervision and 200 hours community service. Carrigan also has to pay a £100 victim surcharge.","Deborah Carrigan stole cash from Ada Berlin's hand bag on four occasions .

"This woman is suspected of dying of the Ebola virus in Liberia, but a local burial team is still forced to spray disinfectant over her in a desperate attempt to stop the disease spreading even further. Now, officials in the country face a difficult choice of deciding which handful of Ebola patients will receive an experimental drug that could prove life-saving, ineffective or even harmful. ZMapp, the untested Ebola drug, arrived in the West African country late on Wednesday. A day later, no one had yet received the treatment, which officials said would go to three people. Scroll down for video . Virus outbreak: A burial team from the Liberian health department sprays disinfectant over the body of a woman suspected of dying of Ebola yesterday in Monrovia, Liberia . Difficult time: Children sit in a newly-opened isolation ward set up by the Liberian health ministry in a closed school yesterday in Monrovia. They sleep on matresses on the floor . The government had earlier said two doctors would receive the treatment, and Information Minister Lewis Brown revealed yesterday the third person would probably be another health care worker. These are the last known doses of ZMapp left. The company based in San Diego, California, that developed it has said it will take months to build up even a modest supply. The Ebola outbreak was first identified in March in Guinea. It has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, killing more than 1,060 of the 1,975 people sickened, according to the World Health Organization. There is no licensed treatment for Ebola, a virus transmitted by contact with bodily fluids like blood, sweat, urine, diarrhoea and vomit. The outbreak has overwhelmed the already strained health systems in West Africa and raised questions about whether authorities are doing enough to respond. The US State Department has ordered families of embassy personnel to leave Sierra Leone because of concerns that the crisis would make it difficult to get treatment for even routine health problems. Blue: A man lies in a newly-opened Ebola isolation centre set up by the Liberian health ministry in Monrovia . Sadness: Relatives and neighbours watch as a Liberian burial team prepares to enter the home of a woman suspected of dying of the Ebola virus in Monrovia . Meanwhile, police in riot gear dispersed an angry crowd yesterday in Liberia’s capital of Monrovia who blocked city buses to protest delays in clearing away the infectious body of an Ebola victim. President Barack Obama spoke by phone yesterday about the Ebola outbreak with Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and in another call with President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone. 'The criteria of selection is difficult, but it is going to be done. We are going to look at how critical people are. We are definitely going to be focusing on medical staff' Dr Moses Massaquoi, who helped Liberia obtain ZMapp drug . The White House said Mr Obama expressed his condolences for the hundreds who have died in both countries and underscored America's commitment to work with West African nations and United Nations agencies to contain the outbreak. The outbreak has sparked an international debate over the ethics of giving drugs that have not yet been tested to the sick and of deciding who should get the drugs. So far, only two Americans and one Spaniard have received ZMapp. The Americans are improving - but it is unclear what role the drug has played. The Spaniard died within days. Now Liberian officials are facing those questions. In this outbreak, over 50 percent of those sickened with Ebola have died, according to the UN health agency. Taking care: A Liberian health department burial team disinfects their protective clothing after retreiving the body of a woman suspected of dying of the Ebola virus in Monrovia . Taken away: Neighbours watch as a burial team departs with the body of a woman suspected of dying of the Ebola virus in Monrovia . ‘The criteria of selection is difficult, but it is going to be done,’ said Dr. Moses Massaquoi, who helped Liberia obtain the drug from Mapp Biopharmaceutical. ‘We are going to look at how critical people are. We are definitely going to be focusing on medical staff.’ He added people past the ‘critical phase’ who looked likely to survive would not be chosen. 'Who gets the chance to be experimented on?' Arthur Caplan, New York University Langone Medical Center . Massaquoi said there was only enough of the drug to treat three people. Treatment will be staggered, so doctors can observe the effects in one patient before moving on to the next. Last night he said the treatment had not yet started. Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, said the choice of who to treat would have to balance helping the largest number of people with learning the most from the treatments. He said the question is not ‘whose life do we save?’ but ‘who gets the chance to be experimented on?’ Untested: Liberian Foreign Affairs Minister Augustine Ngafuan (left) and a porter bring boxes of an experimental Ebola-fighting drug ZMapp on a Delta Airlines flight from New York's JFK Airport to Monrovia . Checks: Kenyan health officials take the temperatures of passengers arriving at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. The World Health Organization said Kenya is a high-risk area for transmission . For that reason, recipients need to be good experimental subjects - people who have recently contracted the disease and are more likely to respond to treatment or perhaps younger patients, he said. In order to study the long-term effects, doctors will likely prefer people who can be observed for months, which might eliminate those living in remote places, he added. Nigeria announced yesterday that another person had died from Ebola, bringing the country's death toll to four. The Health Ministry said the person was a nurse who helped treat the country's first Ebola case, Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer who flew in last month and died. The ministry corrected its total number Ebola cases to 10 instead of 11 as it had reported earlier in the day.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A 100-year-old New York woman has opened up about meeting the love of her life, and staying with him until his death. In a tear-jerking YouTube video made by Humans of New York photographer Brandon Stanton, the woman, only known as Shirley, speaks lovingly of her late husband Moe. 'We didn't say we were going to get married. We just knew,' she says of their first few encounters. 'It was a meeting of the souls.' True love: Shirley, 100 years old, has opened up about falling in love with her husband Moe in their youth, and staying with him until the day he died . Shirley is a truly charming character, with a shock of white hair and a tough New York twang to her voice, dressed in a vibrant, multicolored blouse and costume earrings. She lives alone, but for a yellow labrador and a chocolate colored cat, in a fuchsia pink walled apartment, hung with vivid paintings and sprinkled with nicknacks and memorabilia from her late husband. They met at a party, she says. 'We had a good time together, and then, around midnight, we were on this couch,' she recalls, indicating the very cherry-red sofa she is seated on, all these years later. A lifetime of happiness: Shirley says that after the couple met, they 'just knew' they were going to get married . 'We would just dance. Not like they're dancing today,' she chuckles, offering a little jig. 'He had very good rhythm, and it was always nice to have his arms around me.' It was always nice to have his arms around me . Three years after the couple married, Moe received an invitation from the president to be a doctor in the war, she explains, pulling out a portfolio full of old letters and drawings he sent her while he was away. Memories: Shirley says that she and Moe sat on this very couch the first night they met, following a night of dancing, which she demonstrates (pictured) as being nothing like it is today . Pink walls: Shirley's New York apartment is brimming with character, scattered with memorabilia and odes to her husband . Perfectly preserved in plastic, one letter begins: 'The ships come and the ships go. But, I stay here, with my thoughts of you, wondering how soon I'll be once more... with my little angel.' Shirley points at herself animatedly. Then her voice quivers as she describes Moe's year-long illness, followed by his death. Lovingly kept: Shirley has devotedly held onto countless letters Moe wrote for her during his time away at the war, many of which include drawings and cartoons . Moe: Shirley holds up a portrait of her late husband. Her whole apartment is hung with eclectic paintings and black-and-white family photos . Close to the end of his life, Shirley says she asked of him: 'Moe, what will I do without you?' to which he gave her what can only be described as a heartrending reply. 'Take the love you have for me and spread it around...there, beauty is found.' As the video ends, Shirley reads out the last of one of Moe's letters to her. Umbrella days: Shirley can be seen here in a previous photograph of her, taken by Humans of New York photographer Brandon Stanton . Happy family: Shirley seen as a youth (right) with husband Moe (left) and what is presumably their child (center) 'The stars are joining me in sorrow, while I long without wearying,' it reads. 'To hold you once more in my arms, to embrace you and kiss you and love you.' Photographer Brandon Stanton, who has dipped his toes into video only recently, has a strong following in New York and beyond, for his truthful photos of the real people he comes across every day as he roams the city. The stars are joining me in sorrow, while I long without wearying . His magical blend of portraits and poignant, pithy storytelling has earned him more than two million followers online. Mr Stanton, 29, originally from Georgia and now living in Brooklyn, New York, says he dropped out of college, was fired from his first job as a bond trader and didn't own a camera until four years ago.

"Rupert Murdoch and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held a secret meeting at Chequers ahead of the media tycoon's takeover of Times newspapers, it has been revealed. Mr Murdoch personally lobbied the PM over Sunday lunch on January 4, 1981, Mrs Thatcher's files show. Neither party has ever admitted that such a meeting took place, but details of the meeting have now been uncovered in a note written by Mrs Thatcher’s press secretary Bernard Ingham and marked 'Commercial - In Confidence'. Power players: Rupert Murdoch and Margaret Thatcher, pictured at a New York awards dinner in 1991, have never admitted they met ahead of his Times newspapers takeover . The files reveal that Mr Murdoch requested the chat, which came three weeks before the first cabinet committee discussion of his takeover. The Australian sent a handwritten thank-you note to 'My dear Prime Minister' two weeks later, telling her that 'the field has contracted down to only two or three of us' and that Times owners the Thomson family would 'make up their minds in the next day or so'. Mr Murdoch was confirmed as owner of The Times and Sunday Times in February 1981. At no point did Mrs Thatcher publicise the meeting, and she also instructed that the note on the lunch should not leave No 10 Downing Street. The impression given in the newspaper's official history is that Mr Murdoch had had no contact with the prime minister ahead of the Government's approval of his purchase. Mr Ingham's note shows that the media boss tried to bond with the Conservative prime minister by praising Ronald Reagan's new administration. Confined to No 10: Press Secretary Bernard Ingham's note on the PM's meeting with the media tycoon . He then explicitly briefed her on his bid and plans for Times Newspapers, including taking on the unions, introducing new technology and reducing the workforce by 25 per cent. He outlined his intention to make the operation profitable by introducing technology and lowering manning levels. But records show there was no discussion of whether a bid would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The government had the power to block the takeover by such a referral because Mr Murdoch already owned The Sun and the News of the World. The deal was apparently not referred to the MMC because ministers feared the newspapers could close if not sold quickly. Trade secretary John Biffen made the decision - but recently released minutes from the economic strategy . committee meeting on 26 January show that the PM spoke to highlight the exemption under the . Fair Trading Act 1973 that would allow Mr Murdoch's bid to avoid a . referral. Growing empire: The minutes from the lunch included a comment by Mr Murdoch that the monetary risks 'could finish us' The newspaper group went on to become the biggest in Britain. News Corporation even came close to taking full control of . BSkyB 30 years later, but the deal collapsed in furore that . followed the revelation that murder victim Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked by . the News of the World. David Cameron's first meeting with a media owner was with Mr Murdoch in July 2010, two months after he became prime minister. The businessman entered No 10 by the back door and the meeting was not initially disclosed when Cameron first published a list of meetings with media owners and newspaper editors in July last year. The Thatcher papers have been released by the Churchill archives centre, Cambridge, after 30 years. 'My dear prime minister': The PM in 1983, left, and Mr Murdoch discussing the future of The Times at a press conference in London on January 22 1981, right . It contradicts the account in the official history of The Times that says Mrs Thatcher and Mr Murdoch 'had no communication whatsoever during the period in which the Times bid and referral was up for discussion'. It suggests the tycoon relied on the columnist Woodrow Wyatt to plead his case. Mr Ingham's note on the lunch says the newspaper owner offered to arrange a meeting for the PM with a group of 'New Right' politicians on her upcoming visit to New York. He also dismissed rival bidders, including Robert Maxwell, as unlikely to impress either Mr Thomson, unions or journalists. Mr Murdoch added that he was risking £50m of News Group's resources in the deal and that such an amount 'could finish us'. Mr Ingham writes that Mrs Thatcher did nothing more than 'wish him well in his bid' as well as noting the need to improve Fleet Street staffing levels and  introduce new technology. The later cabinet committee minutes confirm Mrs Thatcher's role in the discussion but also that the trade department's accountants had advised that The Times was not economic as a going concern. Many people who wanted the MMC to block Murdoch's takeover believed that the Sunday Times would return to financial health.","Talk over Sunday lunch came just weeks before Murdoch bid was approved by Government .

"Freedom was so close, yet so far for this centipede. After being swallowed whole by a snake, it made one last desperate attempt to escape by eating its way out of her stomach. Researchers found the dead nose-horned female viper with its prey exploding from its side during a field study in Macedonia on May 14 last year. Both creatures were dead. Unlucky: A snake was found dead with a centipede's head sticking out of its abdomen in Macedonia last year by a group of researchers . Researchers believe that the 20cm young snake may have underestimated the size of the prey and paid a fatal price. The reptile was found on Golem Grad, also known as Snake Island, and was reported in the journal Ecologica Montenegrina by Serbian herpetologist Ljiljana Tomovic last month. Tomovic came to a conclusion that the juvenile snake also ate its meal alive due to the full-grown insect's tough invertebrate. 'We cannot dismiss the possibility that the snake had swallowed the centipede alive, and that, paradoxically, the prey has eaten its way through the snake, almost reaching its freedom,' she wrote. in an article headed 'Two fangs good, a hundred legs better'. The last supper: Researchers believe the viper underestimated the size and strength of the full-grown insect . Not so tasty: The paper 'Two fangs good, a hundred legs better' reported that the young viper swallowed its prey whole and alive . A post-mortem revealed the 15cm fighter, also known as Scolopendra cingulata, caused damage to the Vipera ammodytes' digestive organs. Tomovic wrote that it wasn't uncommon for young vipers from Golem Grad to consume such creatures but this case was particularly startling as the prey was over-sized. 'Unexpectedly, the mass of the prey was greater than that of the predator: the viper weighed 4.2 g and the centipede 4.8 g,' she wrote. 'We assume the young snake gravely underestimated the size and strength of the centipede, which itself is known as a ferocious predator.'","Researchers found the two creatures on Golem Grad, in Macedonia .

"FA head of security Tony Conniford admitted that the association is 'freaking out over safety in Rio' FA head of security Tony Conniford said senior figures in the England set-up were ‘freaking out’ over reports of crime and violence from Rio’s gang-ridden shanty towns, or favelas, the largest of which,  Rocinha, is near England’s hotel. He also raised the astonishing prospect that England stars such as Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard could be stuck on the team bus for up to four hours in gridlocked traffic as they travel nine miles to and from their training base. While officially the FA say they are ‘fully confident’ in security arrangements, former policeman Mr Conniford’s comments, overheard by a Mail on Sunday reporter in the bar of the England hotel in Rio, raise questions about preparations. Mr Conniford’s assessment was delivered in a loud voice to a Brazilian colleague. A reporter from this newspaper was having a meal at a nearby table and was able to take notes. Mr Conniford, a 30-year veteran of Essex Police, told the Brazilian, an ex-military officer: ‘The problems here have been all over the papers. It’s bad. I get calls from management, from my bosses at the FA, freaking out saying, “Tony, are you sure it’s safe?” ‘They ask me, “Is this really going to be safe for the team?” They are worried. These are real concerns. ‘We have to be extra vigilant. We cannot afford to make any mistakes. Security must be paramount.’ Mr Conniford’s comments – coming just a month before the tournament kicks off – raise serious question marks over the FA’s decision to base themselves in central Rio. England’s hotel, the ageing Royal Tulip, is rated by travel website TripAdvisor as only the 93rd best in the city. Only one other team – Holland, who will train much closer to their hotel – are based in the city, while Germany have built their own private beach resort to stay in. England's hotel is located within view of the Rocinha favela in Rio where armed gangs are being targeted by police . Mr Conniford told his colleague that a nine-mile trip between the squad’s training base in a military camp at Sao Joao Fort in Urca in the shadow of Sugarloaf mountain and the hotel had taken him two hours. He said: ‘The traffic is awful. Even with a police escort it will be a nightmare. The roads are terrible. The traffic is my biggest worry. This is a logistical nightmare. We have to work on how we get the team from A to B without getting held up. ‘We will be stuck in traffic the whole time.’ The airport, where the England players and their retinue, totalling no fewer than 78 people, will have to travel to to get to their group games, is even further away. Mr Conniford said he also had concerns about security within the Urca military base when England were training. He told the Brazilian: ‘Your guys need to know they can challenge anyone to see their badges. They must check and re-check everyone.’ And on hotel security, he said: ‘We can’t afford to let anyone in because once you are through that door out there you can go straight to the lift and get straight up to the players’ rooms in no time.’ As more than 50,000 England fans prepare to descend on Brazil, it is hard to imagine they have much idea of what actually awaits them: . Heavily armed snipers have been tasked to patrol the Rocinha favela, near where the England team will be based for the World Cup . Brazilian authorities are having difficulties clamping down violence in advance of the World Cup . The host cities for England’s first games – Manaus, Sao Paolo and Belo Horizonte – are plagued by robberies, murders and muggings. Sao Paolo has its own slum problem and, in Manaus, a steaming jungle city a four-hour flight north of Rio, child ‘gangs’ roam the streets robbing visitors at knifepoint. The violence shows no sign of abating. One person was shot dead on Friday as Rio police clashed with armed men in a favela close to the England hotel. Over the past six years the Rio authorities have established 39 so-called police pacification units, or UPPs, in the favelas in an attempt to smash drug and street gangs. England captain Steven Gerrard  and his team will be based within view of Rio's biggest slum as they prepare for their three World Cup group matches . More than 50,000 England fans are expected to travel to the tournament where there have been regular violent protests . Adrian Bevington, Managing Director of Club England, said: ‘The FA are confident in the security arrangements in place. Tony is a vastly experienced officer and was simply overheard doing his job. He has our full support.’ Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who is a qualified referee and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Football Group, said last night: ‘Like every English fan, I want our team and its management to be as safe as possible and would expect these concerns to have been addressed by now.’ An FA source said that Mr Conniford was using the opportunity to emphasise to Brazilian authorities that their extra support is appreciated and the conversation was private.","In England's dilapidated hotel next to the gangland slum, he tells of 'real concerns' for our players .

"As Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, hackers have found increasingly sophisticated ways to illegally ‘mine’ the virtual currency. Now a new method has been uncovered which uses malware infected adverts on Yahoo to make computers into Bitcoin slaves. Yahoo has confirmed that the breach took place last week and experts now believe as many as two million European users could have been affected. Yahoo has confirmed that the breach took place last week and experts believe there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site . In this recent attack, the hackers used malware to exploit something known as ‘Bitcoin mining’. The mining process works on the premise that there are 21 million Bitcoins hidden across an internet-based network, which are expected to all be found by 2040. To unearth Bitcoins, computers have to solve the complex processor-intensive equations which hold them. The more powerful the machine the better it is at solving the riddle. Computer-makers have been creating high-powered souped-up computers so they can do it repeatedly and rapidly to collect the most coins. In this recent attack, the hackers used malware to exploit something known as 'Bitcoin mining'. The mining process works on the premise that there are 21 million Bitcoins hidden across an internet-based network, which are expected to all be found by 2040 . Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer . digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as . the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. A . Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than . half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four . years ago. Bitcoin mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to collect the virtual currency, without using their own high-powered computers. Other than a slow computer, those infected with the maleware be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ‘bitnet’. Experts estimate that these criminal networks could be generating as much as $100,000 (£60,000) each day. The value of Bitcoin rose to over $1000 (£613) last year but is currently worth around $850 (£520). Unlike traditional banking, Bitcoin and its rival virtual currencies, can be bought with near anonymity which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. Yahoo has come under for not or doing anything to help those who had been targeted with the malware, which attacked flaws in Java modules on systems. Fox IT, the Dutch cybersecurity firm which first disclosed the vulnerability to the public, estimated that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site. Users in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America, as well as those using Apple Macs and mobiles, weren't affected, the group said. ‘The attack focused on outdated software,’ Steve Regan of security site CSO told the Guardian. ‘The only way for the exploits to work is to have outdated versions of Java on your system. If Java is up to date, then the odds are, you're safe. ‘However, I don't trust Java, so unless you absolutely need it, my advice is to uninstall it from your system. It seems like I see more zero-day attacks aimed at Java than anything else, the risk isn't worth it for me.’ Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as the Bank of England .","Virus stole computer power to make it easier for criminals to mine Bitcoins .

"He has been the spitting image of Kim Jong Il for more than decade - with his bouffant hairdo, large glasses and olive green suit. And while he got plenty of abuse in the street from the misguided few who really thought he was the North Korean dictator, South Korean Kim Young Sik was never short of work as his double. But now it looks like the good times are over and southern Kim will have to hang up his wide-waisted trousers for good following the death of northern Kim. 'People try to comfort me, saying some . figures are more famous when they're dead, but I don't think it will be . the case with Kim,' said the engraver. But he added wistfully: 'I feel very empty, as if a part of me died.' Scroll down for video... Look-a-like: South Korean engraver Kim Young Sik has impersonated Kim Jong Il for more than a decade . Spot the difference: Kim Young Sik (left) fears his career as a look-a-like for Kim Jong Il (right) is over . Sik, 61, said he never dreamt of becoming a part-time communist ruler and fell into the role by accident. He said: 'One day after I got out of the shower and my hair was very curly, people told me I looked like Kim Jong Il.' When then-South Korean president Kim Dae-Jung began the Sunshine Policy of reconciliation with the North in the late 1990s he started to be noticed and was invited to appear on television. In mourning: The father-of-two, who has moonlighted as his look-a-like for more than a decade, said he felt a part of him had died . Who's who: Kim Young Sik (left) is the spitting image of North Korea's departed leader Kim Jong Il (right) Since then he has enjoyed an . illustrious career appearing on Japanese TV, in a Middle East chocolate . commercial, and in 1995 South Korean film The Rose of Sharon Blooms . Again. North Korea's military has pledged . to keep up its aggressive stance towards the west under the country's . new leader, Kim Jong Un. Top generals from the secretive . state said today they would refuse to work with South Korea's president . Lee Myung-bak, whom they described as a 'traitor'. The belligerent message came after . Kim Jong Un was declared 'Great Leader' for the first time following the . death of his father Kim Jong Il last week. North Korea's powerful National . Defence Commission said the country would never deal with Mr Lee, a . conservative who stopped a no-strings-attached aid policy toward the . North in 2008, and that it was 'uniting around Great Leader comrade Kim . Jong Un'. The movie was about a South Korean . scientist who secretly helped the North develop nuclear weapons to . prevent a Japanese invasion. It led to him rubbing shoulders with celebrities and world leaders - or at least people who look like them - including George W Bush and Vladimir Putin impersonators. But the highs of portraying a man who presided over a deadly famine and tested a nuclear bomb have not been without the lows, and he regularly receives abuse walking down the street. He said: 'Some people curse at me and call me 'dictator', but those who know me wave and shout 'Kim Jong-Il!'. Then I would wave back at them and show them some of Kim's moves.' It is also tough work keeping up Kim's appearance. He perms his hair every three months and before his death closely followed changes in his look and demeanour. He even went on a diet when the late leader lost weight following a 2008 stroke. Abused: Kim Young Sik regularly receives heckles from passersby who think he is the North Korean leader . Commemorative: Postage stamps have been released in honour of Kim Jong Il. On the left he appears with his son Kim Jong Un with 'The great leader comrade Kim Jong Il will always be with us' above and (right) he appears alone with the text 'The great leader comrade Kim Jong Il will live forever' He added: 'Back when Kim Jong-Il was . young, I used to use hairspray, but after he got old and started to lose . hair, I didn't have to do anything.' He has four different suits made in the style of the late ruler along with five pairs of platform shoes. He added: 'Before, I used to wear the . outfits almost everyday, but now I just wear them once in a while and . when I'm invited to be Kim Jong Il at an event. It's a shame I won't be . able to wear them anymore.' Since Kim Jong-Il died on December 17, he fears his career is almost over. He also regrets never having met his inspiration or even visiting North Korea. He added: 'Kim was a great man in a way because although he was a dictator, he built a country like no other. Do you think anyone could do it?' Now, as Kim's youngest son Kim Jong Un inherits the world's last communist dynasty, the late leader's double thinks it is time to step aside for a new generation. He said: 'I'd like to do more acting as Kim Jong Il, but they'll find someone new for Jong Un. They asked if my son looked like him but he doesn't or I would have sent him to an audition.' Eagle-eyed observers of how North Korea's media covered Kim Jong Il's funeral believe they have been up to their old tricks - with a spot of Photoshopping. A seemingly doctored photograph has emerged of a soldier, who appears to be well over 8ft tall, in the back row of one block of mourners. The image was captured as the funeral procession passed near the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in the capital Pyongyang. In the crowd: The giant soldier, circled, is barely visible amongst the blocks of mourners . Standing out: But then, on closer inspection, he can clearly be seen towering above his colleagues . Official news agency KCNA took the photo, and the giant soldier appears to show him from several different angles. Some believe it could be 7ft 8in tall North Korean basketball star Ri Myung Hun. It follows yesterday's emergence of evidence showing how the scores of wailing mourners were not the only well-choreographed aspect at the memorial service. Two comparison photos (below) showed how a camera crew filming the sombre ceremony were apparently erased from history after being digitally removed from the picture.","'I feel very empty, as a part of me died'

"There was a moment during Wayne Rooney’s return to where it all started, when 99 England caps and all those honours were the furthest thing from his mind. Standing in the foyer of Our Lady and St Swithin’s Catholic Primary School, peering into the main hall, the sight of 99 excited pupils — who had gathered to mark the latest milestone in his glittering career — took him back to his childhood. It was in this school, in the working-class Croxteth area of Liverpool, that Rooney’s dreams of becoming a top footballer took flight. This is where he began kicking a ball in earnest, scampering around on a little yard he remembers ‘felt as big as three pitches’. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney return to his first school for an iconic photograph . Wayne Rooney returned to Our Lady and St Swithin's Catholic School in Liverpool ahead of winning his 100th England cap on Saturday . Rooney was joined by 99 children from the school in Sportsmail's exclusive photoshoot to commemorate the striker's century .

Rooney will become England’s ninth centurion when he leads the team out against Slovenia at Wembley this Saturday. In recognition of the achievement, he took part in a photoshoot for Sportsmail that had echoes of the iconic images of former England captains Bobby Moore (1973) and Steven Gerrard (2012). As he walked into the hall, Manchester United’s captain was given a deafening ovation. The children, who had behaved impeccably as they waited patiently for him to arrive, sang his name and cheered as he took his place among them. If Rooney felt any nerves, they were quickly dispelled as he was bombarded with questions and affectionate slaps on the back. He may play his club football down the M62 but he remains very much a local hero. This, clearly, was a humbling experience. Each of the 99 children had their shirt signed by the England and Manchester United forward as they shared the special occasion . Rooney, at his old school for an exclusive Sportsmail photoshoot, talks to some of the 99 pupils who took part in the group picture . Wearing one of his England caps, national team skipper Rooney chats with the Class of 2014 at the school where it all started for him . ‘It was very special to come back to the school I went to as a young boy,’ said Rooney. ‘I saw a few former teachers who were here when I was and it was great to see the kids so delighted. This is where I started kicking a ball around. ‘All the young kids here have dreams. All the young lads grow up wanting to be footballers. They love the sport. ‘I was the same when I was here. I just wanted to be a professional footballer and I have managed to do that. So to captain my country and be closing in on 100 caps is special. ‘It’s great for the school as well. I’m really proud of where I come from and it’s great that I can come back to the area. They all know I play for Manchester United and hopefully they are proud of what I have done in my career. Hopefully it inspires them. ‘For the kids to see someone who has been to this school and gone on to achieve what I have done, shows they can achieve their dreams. I know what it is like. Franny Jeffers went to my senior school (De La Salle) and he inspired me. It would be great to think that it would be the same for these.’ Rooney poses in the middle of the children who were thrilled to have a visitor of his stature drop into their school .

Rooney has his audience captivated as he talks about playing for England and Manchester United . There is no doubt he is a beacon at St Swithin’s. In the foyer, an England shirt and ball signed by Rooney provide a daily reminder to pupils of what can be achieved with talent, hard work and dedication. ‘Wayne gives the children self-belief and he has got every value that we value,’ said headteacher Sandra Hamilton. ‘He is mature and resilient; a leader. He is world-class. We look at him as a wonderful family man and are extremely proud of everything that he does.’ Rooney has enjoyed many memorable days but this, clearly, struck a chord. It was also special for the 99 children, each of whom left with the shirt they wore for the photograph sporting his autograph.

"Newcastle have completed the season-long loan signing of Shakhtar Donetsk striker Facundo Ferreyra. The 23-year-old Argentinian has joined up with the squad in Germany ahead of their final game of the Schalke 04 Cup against the hosts on Sunday afternoon. Manager Alan Pardew would still like to bring another front-man to St James' Park but believes Ferreyra has the potential to succeed in the Premier League and an option is in place – thought to be in the region of £6m – to make the deal permanent. Transfer: Argentinian striker Facundo Ferreyra has signed for Alan Pardew's men on a season-long loan . Pardew said: 'Facundo is someone we know on a number of levels, including his friendship with Fabricio (Coloccini), and we think he could be a big success here at Newcastle. 'This is a player who has played at the top level and is highly-regarded in Argentina. 'He has tremendous potential and hopefully he can realise that here at Newcastle United.' Ferreyra, who scored 17 times for Velez Sarsfield in his homeland in 2013 before his move to Ukraine, had concerns about returning to Donetsk amid the political unrest and violence in the country. Option: Alan Pardew has a £6million option to land Ferreyra on a  permanent deal if he impresses . Competition: Ferreyra will provide some much needed competition for Papiss Cisse and Emmanuel Riviere . Replacement: After failing to sign Loic Remy, Newcastle have finally secured another striker for the coming season . And he said: 'I am very pleased to sign for Newcastle United. 'I like the Premier League and when I knew that Newcastle were interested in me, it was a very easy decision to make . 'I spoke to my friend Fabricio Coloccini, and when he told me about the club, I didn't need to think twice.'","Newcastle sign Facundo Ferreyra on season-long loan .

The phrase like shooting fish in a barrel is well known but shooting fish out of a cannon is perhaps a more unusual idea. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) has developed the bizarre cannon to move hatchery and chinook salmon upriver in Washington state. The cannon which has been developed by Whooshh Innovations has been amusingly nicknamed the 'salmon cannon'. In a press release Whooshh CEO Vince Bryan said the device can move the fish from the weir of the Washougal River up to the riverbank with minimal handling. Although the device is called a cannon the device does not shoot fish out of it. Instead the fish are passed along the Whooshh tube and once they reach the end they are put into a truck tanker which brings them to a nearby hatchery. Fast: The fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds in the Whooshh tube . WDFW personnel load the fish into the salmon cannon as they prepare to transfer them to the truck tanker . Cannon: WDFW personnel say the process of transfering the fish via the salmon is a big improvement . The fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds when they enter the Whooshh tube and it is fast and efficient. One of the primary benefits of the Whooshh tube according to WDFW hatchery reform coordinator Eric Kinne is that the process eliminates a large amount of stress which previously affected the fish. Mr Kinne said the process of moving the fish from the centre of the river to the tanker trucks had been problematic and the new system made the process of moving the fish much easier. Speed: A fish is loaded into the salmon cannon which despite its name does not fire fish out the other end . Novel: The salmon cannon is a novel idea which has been met with a groundswell of approval by the WDFW . Success: Fish enter into the truck tanker after they are transported through the Whoossh tube .,"Fish are able to travel a distance of 120 feet in approximately five seconds .

"Photoshoots are complicated at the best of times. You often have little time to get the perfect shot and there are so many moving parts. So imagine throwing 99 primary school children into the mix. And then deciding to put them all in England shirts surrounding Wayne Rooney. This was going to be a challenge. Putting the kids in shirts rather than caps – as we did when we took a similar picture for Steven Gerrard’s 100th cap – was a fairly late decision. That gave us just a couple of days to find and get 99 shirts to Liverpool. Of course we wanted the kids to be able to keep them too.

Step in, Pro Direct Soccer at the last minute with a phone call that rescued the shoot and stopped us from having to disappoint the brilliant people at Our Lady and Saint Swithin's Catholic Primary School – and Rooney. They agreed to provide all the kits and managed to send them up from their base in Newton Abbot in Devon in time for the shoot. After that it was the crazy game of organising all the shirts into colours and sizes and getting the right children in the right tops. We laid them all out on tables in the formation we wanted and then the kids filed in and put on the right tops. The hardest part? Making sure the kids stayed in the right order as they filed into the gym for the photo. Luckily, they were incredibly well behaved, looked fantastic in their tops and got them all signed by Rooney at the end. A day they will never forget.

"A two-timing carpenter who rose to notoriety after building totem poles for a Princess Diana memorial park has admitted that he crushed his wife with one of his creations so he could start a new life with his mistress. Carl Muggli, 51, entered a guilty plea in an International Falls, Minnesota, court yesterday in the November 2010 death of wife Linda Muggli, who died under the weight of a massive totem pole. Muggli had originally claimed that the 17-foot totem pole fell on his wife by accident while his back was turned . Together: Carl Muggli admitted on Wednesday that he killed wife Linda by dropping a 2,900-pound wooden pole on her as they carved it together at their country home . But his story began to unravel when an anonymous tipster came forward with 'intimate' Facebook messages that Muggle had exchanged with a woman in Alabama in the days before and after his wife's death. In the string of messages, he tells the . mistress - who has only been identified as 'MLG' - that he loved her and wanted to . move in with her. And on the day before the murder, he . wrote to the other woman: 'I want us together to live our lives as we seek... I am yours. We are one!' Other correspondences found on Muggli's computer showed that he was looking to buy or lease a house in Texas to share with the woman. Busted: Carl Muggli was arrested seven months after his wife's death . Police were also skeptical of Muggli's story when their attempts to recreate the 'accident' were unsuccessful. Five times the detectives arranged . the pole in the way that Muggli had said, but they could not get it to . fall in the way that he claimed. They . also found that the totem pole in question had been 'stained or . polyurethane-coated,' implying that there was an attempt to cover up . evidence. After his guilty plea was entered, Muggli's attorney, Charles Hawkins, told Minnesota's Star Tribune newspaper: 'This whole thing is a tragic occurrence... He did not want to put the family, his family or himself through any more misery.' He will be sentenced on February 4. Muggli and his wife, who was 61 when she died, became famous for carving three totem poles that were used in the Indian Village section of Princess Diana's Memorial Children's Park in Kensington Gardens, London. They had been working together on the carvings since 1990 on their property just outside Voyageurs National Park, in Ray, Minnesota. Their totem poles ranged from 16 feet to 50 feet tall. According to a complaint filed by the Koochiching County Attorney, police arrived on the scene to find the giant carving across her chest and blood pouring from underneath her. She was taken to a nearby hospital but died of her injuries on November 26, 2010. In an interview with reporters soon after Muggli claimed: 'The totem we were working on was progressing wonderful. Creative duo: Carl and Linda Muggli had been working together on the carvings since 1990 on their property just outside Voyageurs National Park, in Ray, Minnesota . 'I mean, it was just coming really good, and we were laughing and joking and having a great conversation, just…and then it was over.' Muggli was arrested in Stockdale, . Texas, about seven months after Linda Muggli's death, and was later . extradited back to Minnesota. It is not clear if he was living with his mistress at the time. Their . Native Veterans Totem, honoring American Indians who served in the . military, stands outside the Veterans Administration hospital in . Brockton, Massachusetts. There is also a Muggli totem pole outside Chalet Geronimo in the French Alps. Fame: The Mugglis carved three totem poles used in the Indian Village section of Princess Diana's Memorial Garden in Kensington Gardens, London . Remembered: Princess Diana's Memorial Garden was opened in June 2000 . Carl Muggli's wife Linda Muggli died on November 26 2010. His mistress lived in Alabama and is referred to only as M.L.G. October 23, 2010 – M.L.G. writes via Facebook: 'I love you and want this all even to be the only one within your life and I well Marry you I just do not want problems we can handle this all but we will do it right for all parties. 'You can always reach me as I can you just carefully.' October 25, 2010 Muggli replies: 'In case you forgot, I LOVE YOU.' November 14, 2010 - Muggli receives an email confirmation regarding his registration at the realtystore.com website. November 17, 2010 – Muggli emails Graces Real Estate in Texas: 'Hi, I'm looking for a home in Texas, something could be a fixer, P++++ even. ‘2+ bdrms, in country, few acres.  Would like to see what’s available around your area.  Please help.' November 19, 2010 – Muggli emails a unidentified individual: ‘Morning sir.  I am considering a move to Texas! Thought I'd ask a few folks about property. ‘Would be interested in basic home on a few acres out away from things.  Anything like that you know of?  May you know someone I could contact? Hope all is well. Getting snow now here. I'm growing into ""wuss"" from winters.' November 25, 2010 – On the day before Linda Muggli’s death, her husband writes via Facebook to his mistress: 'Friendly reminder.' 'Eveningstar-Bunny-MyWife. 'I love you with all my being.  Every move, every though (sic) everything in my life is now for you, US.  I want us together to live our lives as we seek. 'With all the Love, Passion, Affection, Emotion that we have.  These feeling are directly from my soul. For I am with you. I am yours. 'We are one!' On the same day he emails United Country Real Estate in Texas: 'Hi, I just tried a search on your web site.  No results. 'Thought I'd send e-mail. I am looking for a country home on 5 or more acres to rent or lease with option to buy. (my current situation–divorce-will not allow buying) Like a fair home, not fancy. '2+ bed rms. 2 baths garage or outbuildings preferred. Anything you can help me with is appreciated. Happt (sic) Thanksgiving. Carl 218-240-4417.' On November 26 2010 Linda Muggli dies. Two days later on November 28 2010, Muggli wrote to his mistress on Facebook: 'I love you Eveningstar, we'll get through this, I love you, house just got full again, will call soon.' On November 30 at 10am there was a memorial service for Mrs Muggli. But at 2.02pm that day her husband sent M.L.G. a link for property in Palestine, Texas. At 3.30pm that day she replies: ‘Hi Baby, you, U have been nusy (sic), this is good and yes I’ll look, thank U, I'm loving it, all properties good, yes, very good, you well know watch one feel it in your heart, follow your heart as I havebeen doing.

"When Rocky Abalsamo's wife died in 1993, part of him died too. Out of sadness and longing, he would hold vigil by her grave site at St. Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury all day, every day, rarely eating or drinking and weathering all temperatures and conditions. Now, over 20 years after his beautiful Julia 'Julita' passed away, Rocky 'Roque' continues to sit next to his beloved, after being buried in the plot next to her. Rocky died on Janaury 22 at Stonehedge Health Care Center in West Roxbury after several months of declining health, reports The Boston Globe. He was 97. Rain, hail or shine: Rocky 'Roque' Abalsamo has sat by the grave of his wife, Julita, at St. Joseph's Cemetery in Boston since she died in 1993. On January 22 he passed away . Rocky Abalsamo is pictured here on November 26, 2000, aged 84. He died this month, aged 93 . The love of his life: Julita Abalsamo died from complications with heart surgery in 1993 . Rock became something of a celebrity in 2000 after The Boston Globe ran a story about his unwavering devotion to his late wife. The story was picked up by media outlets all over the world. The attention amused Rocky, but all he wanted was to remain close to his wife. The pair met as teenagers in a cafe in their native Buenos Aires. Rocky was sitting with his back to Julita when he overheard her talking with friends 'about the soul, about life, goodness,' Rocky said in the 2000 interview. Even before seeing her face, he decided: 'This is for me. I must know her.' 'She was pure love,' he said. 'Her beauty was a gift apart, a reward.' They shared a first kiss on September 16, 1937 - a date Rocky - celebrated annually - and married the following April. They had a daughter, Angela, and a son, Roque Jr. In 1971 the followed their children to the United States and settled in Boston a year later. Rocky . and Julita had been married for 55 years when she died of complications . after heart surgery in 1993 . Distraught, he began spending his days at . St. Joseph Cemetery. Everyday for 10 years Rocky Abalsamo went to the cemetery when it opened and would leave at closing. He rarely ate during the visits, mostly out of respect but also so he didn't need a bathroom . In 2000, at age 84, he said he had spent the seven years since his wife's death keeping vigil, arriving when the cemetery opened and heading home when it closed. 'She is part of me, so here I am whole,' he said previously. 'Being here makes me feel better. Not good, but better. I do it for Julita, and for myself.' Each morning he would greet Julia - 'I am here!' - unfold his blue chair and unpack the belongings he would bring with him, such as photos and other tokens. He rarely ate or drank, mostly out of respect but also so he does not need a bathroom, and would toast Julita with sparkling cider on special occasions, such as her birthday on December 20. At night he would pray and sprinkle crumbs on the grave so that chipmunks would keep her company after he leaves. Over time, what began as a personal act of mourning touched dozens of others who came to the cemetery. People would bring meals, boots, hats, and scarves, and they decorated Julita’s grave with plants, ceramic angels, flags, and stuffed animals. He told them stories and shared his wisdom about life and love. One of Rocky’s most regular visitors was Linda Handley, a math teacher who lived across the street from St. Joseph Cemetery and walked the grounds for exercise. Rocky Abalsamo scaled back his visits to his wife's grave in 2005, after his son died in a car crash in California . Handley noticed that a groundskeeper named John Tobin also took special care of Rocky. One day while Handley and Rocky were talking, Tobin brought Rocky a pair of sweat pants to wear as an extra layer on cold days. Rocky knew Tobin and Handley were middle-aged and had never married. Rocky arranged to have them visit him at the same time on the 61st anniversary of his first kiss with Julita. Handley and Tobin married a year later, and Rocky took a few hours away from his vigil to attend. In their wedding program, they wrote: 'We are convinced that the miracle of this day is the work of a very special person, Julita Echeverria.' Rocky continued his daily pilgrimage until 2005, when his son was killed in a car crash in California. Although he still visited Julita’s grave regularly, Rocky spent more time with his surviving family members. 'I think he had a realization at that point that we need to let go and we need to continue to live,' his daughter, Angela Arai, told The Globe. His last visit was in July, before he fell ill. Angela said her father’s vigil was often difficult for the family. 'We always had a fear that something was going to happen to him, that we would find him frozen in the winter,' she said. 'We had to let go from our fear so he could live the life he wanted to live. 'The most special thing about my father was that he lived his life his way,' she added. 'He lived one day at a time and enjoyed that day without preoccupations for tomorrow.' As per his requests, he will be buried to Julita’s left, just as they had walked together in life, side by side.","Rocky Abalsamo lost his wife of 55 years, Julita, in 1993 .

Target: The highly-popular Lincoln Memorial was splashed with paint . Gentle work: The green paint is carefully removed from the organ in the Washington National Cathedral's historic Bethlehem Chapel on Tuesday . The woman, who has a Chinese passport, arrived in Washington a few days ago and was traveling on an expired visa, prosecutors said.

Following her arrest, a witness contacted police and reported that the woman had been seen attending a service at a church less than a block from Thomas Circle, according to court documents. The witness reported that the woman was carrying three bags with her. After she left, the witness found that a pipe organ in the church had been splattered with white paint, urine and feces, documents show. Turning green: The woman was arrested Monday on charges she vandalized two chapels at Washington, DC's National Cathedral with green paint.

The Lincoln Memorial was closed temporarily but reopened later Friday. Officials . at the cathedral discovered the paint inside two chapels Monday . afternoon. It was still wet, which led them to believe the vandalism had . just occurred. Officials called police immediately and closed the cathedral to visitors while authorities searched the grounds. The . paint was splashed onto an organ and on the floor inside the . cathedral's historic Bethlehem Chapel on the basement level, officials . said. It was also found inside Children's Chapel in the nave of the . cathedral.

The National Park Service said progressively stronger . substances would be used until all the paint is gone, which could take . several days. The memorial was scheduled to be power washed Tuesday. He noted that while the paint appeared to be . splattered indiscriminately on the memorial, the statue appeared to have . been deliberately painted. The symbols on the statue were not . immediately decipherable. Other targets: The nearby Lincoln Memorial was also vandalized in the area . Similar: Green paint was also used to vandalize the Lincoln Memorial on Friday, along with some white paint . Cleanup: National Park Service employees clean green paint from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington after it was targeted .

D.C. police said paint from the cathedral would likely be sent to the FBI for testing. Bethlehem Chapel was opened in 1912 and is the oldest section of the cathedral. It was the site of President Woodrow Wilson's burial rites, and his remains were entombed there for more than three decades. Wilson's remains were later interred in a memorial bay on the cathedral's main level.","Jia M.

"The world's first space conversation between a robot and an astronaut is set to take place later this year. The talking robot called Kirobo - after 'kibo', which means hope in Japanese, and 'robot' - is set to join a Japanese astronaut into space in August. Its developers have gathered in Tokyo to demonstrate the . humanoid robot's ability to talk and it has been answering questions . from attending journalists. The robot called Kirobo, pictured, will be sent to the International Space Station in August to communicate with astronauts stationed on the station for long periods of time . Kirobo is a mix of 'kibo', which means hope in Japanese, and 'robot'. Its developers gathered in Tokyo to demonstrate the humanoid robot's ability to talk and it was able to answer questions from attending journalists . The experiment is a collaboration . between advertising and PR company Dentsu, the Research Center for . Advanced Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Robo Garage . and Toyota Motor Corp. 'Russia was the first to go outer space, . the U.S. was the first to go to the moon, we want Japan to be the first . to send a robot-astronaut to space that can communicate with humans,' said Yorichika Nishijima, the Kirobo project manager. Tomotaka Takahashi, CEO of Robo Garage and associate professor at the University of Tokyo, said he hopes robots like Kirobo that hold conversations will eventually be used to assist astronauts working in space. 'When people think of robots in outer space, they tend to seek ones that do things physically,' said Takahashi. 'But I think there is something that could come from focusing on humanoid robots that focus on communication.' Because Kirobo does not need to perform physical activities, it is smaller than most robots that go into space. Kirobo's creator Tomotaka Takahashi shows off his humanoid robot during its unveiling at a press event in Tokyo. Kirobo's design is based on the commercial Robi kit robot with modifications for operating safely in zero gravity, facial recognition and the ability to understand emotions . Weighing just 2.2 pounds and standing at 34cm tall, Kirobo has not been designed to carry out physical activities. Instead it is hoped similar robots will one day assist on space missions by answering astronauts' questions . Kirobo is about 34 centimeters tall (13 inches) and weighs about 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds). Its land-based counterpart Mirata looks almost identical but is not designed to go into outer space. Instead, it has the ability to learn through the conversations it has. During the demonstration, Fuminori Kataoka, project general manager from Toyota, asked Kirobo what its dream was. 'I want to create a future where humans and robots can live together and get along,' it answered. Kirobo is scheduled to be launched from the Tanegashima Space Center on August 4, 2013.

"With skin hanging limp across broken skeletons, these grisly remains are yet more evidence of the bloodlust that gripped the former Yugoslavia in the early-Nineties. Two decades after Serb soldiers carried out house-to-house searches in a campaign of ethnic killings in Bosnia, investigators are digging up what could turn out to be the largest mass grave from the war. The remains of 360 people have so far been found at the Tomasica mass grave, which was discovered last month near the town of Prijedor, 162 miles north-west of the Bosnian capital, . Sarajevo. That number, already far more than authorities expected, is expected to rise and could even one day surpass the 629 bodies found at Crni Vrh in Srebrenica. Europe's shame: Bosnian technical worker Zlatan Music inspects . the personal belongings of victims of Serbian ethnic cleansing in Bosnia whose bodies were exhumed from the . Tomasica mass grave at the Sejkovaca identification centre, near the . town of Prijedor, 162 miles north-west of the Bosnian capital, . Sarajevo . The Sarajevo-based Missing Persons' Institute said the Tomasica grave is linked to a secondary one found in 2003 about six miles away, where the bodies of 373 victims had been hidden. It is believed the perpetrators of the killings moved parts of their victims' dismembered remains from one grave to the other in a bid to conceal the crime. In some gruesome cases, parts of the same person have been found in both graves. The institute's Mujo Begic said he expects more remains to be found at the Tomasica site, and the bodies are of Bosniak and Croat men, women and children killed in their villages during the war. 'Together with the relocated ones, the number of the bodies here indicates the biggest mass grave so far found in Bosnia,' he said. 'We have found some identification documents in the grave, so we know who these people are.' The grave covers more than 53,820 sq/ft (5,000 sq/m) and is about 30ft (10m) deep.

It is believed the perpetrators of the killings moved parts of . their victims' dismembered remains from one grave to the other in a bid . to conceal the crime . The fighting which erupted with the collapse of Yugoslavia has become infamous for the war crimes involved, including mass murder and genocide, which made it Europe's deadliest conflict since the Second World War. Between 130,000 and 140,000 are estimated to have been killed in four years of bloodshed which began in 1991 with the secession of Slovenia and the outbreak of the Croatian war of independence. But it was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which began a year later, that was to be the most barbaric. These were the first conflicts since Second World War to be formally judged genocidal and many key players were subsequently charged with war crimes by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Ethnic cleansing: Most of the victims were killed in their . villages and brought to this location to be buried, but teams have also . found bullets in the grave which indicates that some were brought here . alive and that this was also an execution site, prosecutor Eldar Jahic . said, citing evidence and witnesses . Tomasica is near Prijedor, which was a site of horrific crimes against humanity committed by Christian Orthodox Serbs against Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats. Many of the victims were killed in one of the three Nazi-style concentration camps Serb authorities had set up near Prijedor. Authorities hope some of the 1,200 still missing from the area are now found in the Tomasica grave. The remains will be definitively identified through DNA matching from samples provided by living relatives. Most of the victims were killed in their villages and brought to this location to be buried, but teams have also found bullets in the grave which indicates that some were brought here alive and that this was also an execution site, prosecutor Eldar Jahic said, citing evidence and witnesses. Near the grave, Vahida Behlic, 51, was sobbing as she watched forensic experts dressed in white uniforms and green rubber boots carefully lifting bones from the site, where skeletons were piled on top of each other. She came from Slovenia, where she has lived with her family since she escaped her native village of Zecovi, near Prijedor. Mrs Behlic came with her husband and son because she thinks one of the skeletons could be of her mother Fatima who was 60 when Serb soldiers came, dragged her out of the basement and shot her in front of her house. 'I heard the story from a witness who survived because his own grandmother threw herself on him and covered him with her body,' she said. A boy back then, the witness arrived in Slovenia injured, where he told her what he saw. 'He said 32 people were killed that day. Standing here, I have the feeling they are watching us from down there.'","Bosnian conflict was the first since the Second World War to be formally judged genocidal .

"A navy warship accidentally fired a 45kg torpedo into a dockyard wharf, it has emerged. HMS Argyll was on a training exercise in Plymouth when the 9ft missile was ‘jettisoned unexpectedly’. It tore through a security fence at the Devonport naval base before slamming into a storage container. The Royal Navy said the Test Variant Torpedo was a dummy weapon that did not contain any explosives. Base: The scene at Devonport after a boat accidentally discharged a torpedo earlier this week . Blunder: No one was hurt in the accident, which took place during a training exercise . It said there was only minor damage . to the security fence and no one was injured in the incident on . Wednesday afternoon, but training has been suspended while an . investigation is carried out. A . Navy spokesman said: ‘HMS Argyll was conducting a system test when an . inert Test Variant Torpedo was jettisoned unexpectedly. The torpedo is . not an explosive hazard. ‘The specific details of the incident are subject to further investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further.’ HMS Argyll, which was built in the late 1980s, is the longest-serving Type 23 frigate in the Royal Navy. The Ministry of Defence refused to say whether or not any of the submarines were at Devonport at the time of the accident. A . source said: 'The torpedo came shooting out of the side of Argyll and . flew through the air before going straight through a security fence. 'It's . carried on going before hitting a storage container. If anyone was . inside it they would have a had a nasty shock - the whole side of the . container was stoved in. Blunder: HMS Argyll accidentally filed a torpedo during a training exercise at Devonport naval base . Bang: The 9ft torpedo weighed 45kg and left a large dent in a metal storage container (file photo) 'Had the thing been armed it would have let out a 200-metre blast. You could be talking about a major loss of life. 'The Navy guys and the civilian dock workers are understandably appalled by what has happened. Someone has obviously pushed the button, presumably by accident - the big question is who.' HMS Argyll is currently the oldest serving Duke Type 23 frigate in the Royal Navy, having been launched in 1989. The 4,900-tonne ship underwent a £20million refit in 2009 to ensure her weaponry was at the cutting edge of naval warfare. Her . armaments include anti-aircraft missiles, harpoon launchers, a 4.5in . mk8 cannon and two 12.75in 'Sting Ray' torpedo tubes, which are normally . submerged below the water but were exposed by the tide at the time of . Wednesday's accident. Accident: The blunder took place at Devonport, the naval base where nuclear submarines are serviced . Powerful: HMS Argyll is 25 years old but was recently refurbished to bring its weaponry up to date . The self-propelled torpedoes are armed with 45kg warheads to take out enemy submarines that they lock onto with acoustic homing sensors. The Royal Navy spokesman added: 'We can confirm an incident occurred onboard HMS Argyll on Wednesday 12th. The ship was alongside at Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth. 'During a training exercise, an inert . Test Variant Torpedo unexpectedly jettisoned onto the wharf. There was . no explosion and no casualties. 'An investigation is now under way to determine the cause of the incident. The torpedo is not an explosive hazard. 'The specific details of the incident are subject to further investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further. Danger: If the torpedo had been fully armed it could have caused serious damage (file photo) 'The result of the investigation will determine what actions will be necessary to avoid any repeat of this incident in the future. 'However, torpedo system test firing alongside in the naval base has been suspended subject to completion of the investigation.' Devonport, the second biggest naval base in western Europe, is one of three operating bases for the Royal Navy. The 650-acre facility is also the sole military's only nuclear repair and refuelling facility.","HMS Argyll was taking part in a training drill at Devonport base in Devon .

"Divers off the coast of Indonesia have discovered the wreck of a WW2 Nazi U-boat - complete with the skeletons of its lost crew aboard. Initial researches show it to be U-168, a hunter-killer of the German 'Kriegsmarine', which claimed several Allied vessels before it was sent to a watery grave by torpedoes in 1944. A team found the wreck, which contains at least 17 skeletons, north of Java earlier this month after a tip-off from local divers. Sunken: This wreckage was found by divers off the coast of Indonesia . Skeletons: A skull found by Indonesian archaeologists at the site of a sunken German submarine from World War II . 'This is the first time we have found a foreign submarine from the war in our waters,' said Bambang Budi Utomo, head of the research team at the National Archaeology Centre that found the vessel. 'This is an extraordinary find that will certainly provide useful information about what took place in the Java Sea during World War II.' As well as the human skeletons, dinner plates bearing swastikas, batteries, binoculars and a bottle of hair oil were pulled from the wreck. He said further tests were being carried out on the objects to confirm the submarine was indeed 'U-168'. The sub was a type IX C/40 and was launched in March 1942. Captain Helmuth Pich was its commander on four missions for the Third Reich. He survived with 26 other crew hands when it was lost around 1.30am on October 6, 1944, under fire from Dutch submarine HrMs Zwaardvisch - 23 German submariners died in the attack.

One ship damaged . Source: uboat.net . Captain Pich died at the age of 83 in 1997. In its three hunting expeditions for Allied vessels in wartime, his sub sunk one British, one Norwegian and one Greek freighter. Bambang Budi Utomo, head of the research team at the National Archaeology Centre that found the vessel, said it was unlikely the wreck, 60 miles (100km) northeast of Karimunjawa island, would be lifted from the seabed any time soon - due to its sheer size and the cost involved. U-168 was part of the Monsun U-Boats, . which were a group of vessels sent away from the German empire to attack . allied ships along trade routes. Japan occupied Indonesia during World War II, which was then still known by its colonial name of the Dutch East Indies. The Monsun U-Boats operated out of the Dutch East Indies, Jakarta and Sabang between 1943 and 1945. Of the 14 U-boats based in the Far East, only four made it back to Europe. U-168 sailed from France in July 1943 and arrived at Penang in November of the same year. Survivor: Captain Helmuth Pich, pictured, was in charge of the sunken vessel, but lived to tell the tale .

"Shakhtar Donetsk trio Dentinho, Alex Teixeria and Douglas Costa have admitted they are afraid to return to Ukraine while the country is engulfed in conflict. Dentinho, Alex Teixeria and Douglas Costa were among six players who remained in France following a friendly against Lyon on Saturday. And the trio have released statements insisting they are not trying to engineer a move away from the club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Douglas Costa scoring with deceptive left foot shot for Donetsk . Worried: Shakhtar Donetsk's Douglas Costa has chosen to stay in France . Staying put: Costa, pictured with Nemanja Vidic, is afraid of returning to the Ukraine . Dentinho said: ‘We want to clarify that we have no problem with the club. In previous seasons, we have strictly complied with the dates agreed with the coaches. 'But this time, in a meeting at the hotel, together with all Brazilian players after the match against Lyon, because of the conflicts in the country, we are scared and do not want to endanger the lives of our family. ‘It’s an individual decision. As head of the family, I think about my wife and kids and no money in the world will risk their lives. I just want you to understand that the club want to work, want to play, but I can not allow people that I love so much to be endangered. 'I want to play but can not allow people who I love to be endangered. We have read that the embassies of the United States, England, Switzerland and also in Brazil has recommended that people do not travel to the region. The question I ask is: Would you send your child there at the moment?’ Earlier on Monday, Shakhtar’s owner said the players will be punished financially if they fail to return. ‘If they don’t come then in the first instance they will suffer,’ the club’s billionaire owner Rinat Akhmetov said in a statement on the Shakhtar website. Warning shot: Shakhtar Donetsk owner Rinat Akhmetov has told his players they must return to the Ukraine . Refusing to fulfil their contracts could cost the players ‘tens of millions of euros’ in compensation payments to the club, he warned. ‘I don’t rule out that these players will return to the club soon,’ Akhmetov said, adding that several of them could arrive Monday and that the club would not seek to sell them. But Teixeria said his main priority was the safety of his family. He said: ‘Right now, the biggest concern we have is with the safety of us and our families. We respect the decision of those who have decided to play in Ukraine with the club. I have a wife and daughter, they are my priority. 'We know that the airport and the airspace in Donetsk is closed. We gave the suggestion that we train outside the country until everything calms down, The first offer the club gave us was living in Kharkov but a few hours later we were told that the decision was to move to Kiev. 'It showed a lot of uncertainty with the planning. Where would be our families and our children go?’ The Ukrainian military is attempting to retake the city of Donetsk in the east of the country, which is controlled by pro-Russian rebels. Akhmetov is Ukraine’s richest man and a leading power-broker in the east of the country, where his companies employ hundreds of thousands of people. He has publicly opposed the rebels and earlier this month pleaded with Ukrainian forces not to bomb Donetsk. The Ukrainian Football Federation has yet to rule where Shakhtar will play their home games while the conflict rages. Changing places: Shakhtar Donetsk may have to find a new home stadium . Akhmetov has expressed a preference for the mostly Russian-speaking city of Kharkiv in the north-east. ‘We aren’t going to take risks and in no way will we take players to somewhere that is dangerous,’ Akhmetov said. Attacking midfielder Douglas Costa added: ‘I want to clarify that I am not abandoning the club. I’m afraid. Everything we read, see or hear about the situation in the country is quite complicated. We do not know under what conditions we can train much less where to play. 'I have no problem at Shakhtar, but we must understand that there is a serious situation. I’m afraid that other conflict situations will happen and we will be separated from our families. 'I regret that all this is happening. But this time, we all run the risk of life if we are in the region. We talked with the club and we proposed to remain in Switzerland to train until the situation is resolved. We want to stay at the club.’ Shakhtar’s first game of the season is the Ukrainian Super Cup against Dynamo Kiev, which will be played in the western city of Lviv.","Trio release statements stating they are worried about their safety .

But we had such laughs together.' Tribute: The order of service for the funeral, left, and archive photo of John Graham from the Ram Rods in 1962 . The funeral was packed as friends, family, fellow band-mates and fans - all dressed in black and white - remembered the guitar obsessed rocker. The hour-long service, led by Reverend Maz Allen, was full of music and memories of the popular grandfather-of-five, known affectionately as Johnny. Cliff Richard tribute band The Shadow of Cliff, led by Jimmy Jemain, played a number of Johnny’s favourite songs, including Travelling Light, Born to Rock and Roll, Only Angel, and Johnny Be Good. His body entered the church at 12.45pm to Apache and left to Wonderful Land by Hank and Bruce.

In 1967, The Ramrods went their separate ways when founding member Phil Crowther choked and died on honeymoon. But the band continued to play gigs and it was during a rehearsal 20 years ago that June and John met. June explained: 'They had got together to play for the drummer’s 50th birthday. Disease: John, who died aged 67, was diagnosed with a brain tumour and then lung cancer . 'A friend of mine who knew the band invited me along to one of the rehearsals.

But in 2001 John was diagnosed with a brain tumour and he defied the odds until he was struck down with lung cancer. He died last month aged 67. 'He was given five years to live but he managed to beat the odds,' said June. 'Then he got lung cancer 14 months ago and it was that which killed him. 'It was a hard 11 years on him but he was a strong individual. He played all through his illness and only stopped six months ago.'","John Graham was buried in a 12ft long white replica of a Fender Stratocaster .

Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; . once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention . to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me . out and beat my face. I  have . no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries . that resulted from my beating.

'I ran out my back door, shutting it . behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the . fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house.

"Ad was hot topic on Twitter and spurred reaction from many Golden Globe viewers . L'Oreal is a broadcast sponsor for the Golden Globe Awards . L’Oreal has been accused of aggressively airbrushing Diane Keaton after its ad aired immediately after she appeared on stage at the Golden Globes. While Ms Keaton looked fantastic at last night’s event, her 68 years were clear to see on her un-Botoxed face. The L’Oreal ad, however, shows the star with rather smoother skin. Viewers were quick to react to the unfortunate commercial placement, sharing their views on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Snap back: Twitter users began accusing L'Oreal of retouching Diane Keaton after one of her ad campaigns for the beauty brand aired directly after an un-photoshopped appearance on the Golden Globes .

Expressions: While Ms Keaton looks remarkable for her age, its clear how her expression lines are more visible in the Golden Globes telecast (left) than in her L'Oreal ad (right) Film critic Lou Lumenick wrote: ‘Diane Keaton's L'Oreal Commercial is much better than her Woody Allen tribute.’ The actress's campaign spot was to promote L’Oreal’s Age Perfect Glow Renewal oil.

"Local police are searching the Surrey home of the two girls orphaned in the Alps massacre in an attempt to find out who was behind the fatal shootings. French prosecutors have also confirmed in a press conference this afternoon that all four victims were shot twice in the head, and that all immediate family members, including Saad Al-Hilli's brother will be questioned. Two relatives of the Al-Hilli family have gone to France, alongside a British social worker to visit the two girls, Zeena and Zainab, who are under police supervision. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

He visited his nearest police station and 'presented himself spontaneously' to officers 'as a matter of course' after learning of his brother's murder . Public prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the identities of the . relatives who had arrived in France would not be made public for 'security . reasons'. There was confusion yesterday as no . relatives had presented themselves to the authorities to care for the . girls, who were being looked after by British consular staff and nurses. However it is unclear when they would be able to see the elder girl, Zainab, as she continues to be treated in hospital. Officers from Surrey Police erected a tent at the front of the al-Hillis' house today as they prepare to conduct a search of the property with the French police team, led by officer Marc de Tarle. The caravan which the family had been . staying in at the Le Solitaire du Lac campsite in Saint-Jorioz was also removed . by police.

Her . elder sister, seven-year-old Zainab, remains in an artificial coma and . is seen by police as the key to learning what happened. Their uncle and closest living relative, Zaid Al-Hilli, 53, is being questioned in London today over an alleged feud between him and the girls’ murdered father over an inheritance rumoured to be worth anything up to £1million, police said. The desperate plight of the two little girls left alive emerged as it was also revealed that: . Iraq-born aerospace engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Ikbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law were killed by a hail of gunfire while in their BMW on holiday in the French Alps. Local cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, a father-of-three, was shot dead after disturbing the killing spree, and was hit by five bullets. Speaking about the children yesterday, Mr Maillaud added there had been much discussion about who will look after the orphans. Mr Maillaud said he hoped Zainab – who suffered a fractured skull and a bullet in the shoulder – could rebuild her life. 'It is a miracle the girl didn't get a bullet through her head and we feel that she may be able to start her life again,' he said. 'We're hoping the little girl will talk at length. It's awful for a little girl to be a key witness, because she will have to talk about her own suffering, but she's seven and seven is the age of reason, sometimes. She can tell the colour of skin, the colour of clothes, and other information we need.' When asked if their uncle Zaid had offered to be the children's guardian, M. Maillaud replied: 'Not to my knowledge.' Zainab, seven, was shot in the shoulder and beaten 'savagely' about the head. She is in a medically induced coma in Grenoble University Hospital and police are awaiting permission to question her. Her sister was unharmed and found so well hidden next to her mother and grandmother's body that it took police eight hours to find her. Delayed reaction: Several hours after police arrived on scene, Mr Al-Hilli's four-year-old daughter Zeena was found alive huddling under her mother's legs inside the car .

A French police's evidence marker is seen at the crime site in Chevaline, near the Annecy Lake, France . Yesterday, Mr Maillaud said Zeena had . identified her family, and described what he called the 'fury' and . 'terror' of the attack to French police. But . he added that because she hid behind her mother and grandmother's . skirts when the gunfire began she did not see anything important. 'This . is a little girl who must be protected,' he said. 'She should go back . to the UK soon so that she can try and forget this nightmare.' The . prosecutor said: 'We asked her, “Who were you with?”, and she said . first, “With my dad”, and she gave a name, “With my sister”, she gave a . name, “My mother”. 'The . little girl said, talking like a little girl does, she didn't know [the . Swedish woman] very well. We have to assess very clearly, who was that . lady with the Swedish passport?' Police believe this woman was the girl's maternal grandmother. French . and British police are waiting for the go-ahead from medical staff at . the hospital to talk to Zainab, who was hit with 'tremendous ferocity'. Mr . Maillaud said detectives hope the girl, who is in a stable condition, . will recover sufficiently from the trauma to speak to them and that her . memory was not damaged. He said: 'We are waiting for the ballistic . team's report and, when possible, a hearing with the eldest girl. 'Maybe she can give us information on the number of people present for example, or the colour of their skin, and other elements of description that might allow us to consider a bit more seriously a first lead.' On Thursday, some 12 gendarmes stood guard at the hospital alongside a number of security guards. Yesterday, there were no gendarmes, just two security guards.

"An six-year-old boy has found himself worshipped in his tiny Indian village after growing a foot-long tail. Amar Singh has a patch of thick hair on the small of his back, which has grown to more than 12 inches in length to resemble a 'tail'. He is from Nijmapur, a small village in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India, the youngest of five siblings. Scroll down for video . Monkeying around: Amar Singh, aged six, from Uttar Pradesh, northern India, is worshipped in his village for his foot-long 'tail' which grows on his lower back . The family and locals believe that this is some kind of sign that he is connected to the Hindu god Hanuman, a monkey-like deity. And in less-than flattering terms, the family also believes their boy looks like a cow – an animal considered holy in Hindu culture – affirmed by Amar’s interest in cows. This, they say, is further proof that Amar is a divine being. The family say Amar was born with the anomalous patch of hair, which was about one inch in length, and then grew over the years. They say that he is healthy and otherwise a normal boy who does well in his studies at school. ‘Amar is a very loving child,’ says his father, Ajmer Singh. ‘Everybody sees him as a symbol of god.’ Monkey see, monkey do: Amar is being worshipped in the village for his tail and, according to his family, 'a cow-like appearance' Top boy: Amar, pictured with two of his sisters, gets a special treatment in the Singh family . Amar's father, Ajmer Singh, holds up his son's foot-long tail for the camera . Mr Singh explains that although the hairs on Amar’s back could easily be cut and shaved off,  the family are hesitant as they consider them to be a ‘gift from god’. However, the explanation of Amar’s ‘tail’ is less blessed than the family and the village believes. It is a result of the birth defect spina bifida, which can result in lower-back growths or, as in Amar’s case, a tuft of hair, which can grow into a tail if left uncut. Spina bifida occurs when the spinal column does not close all of the way down – it is one of the most common permanently disabling birth defects. The defect happens when something goes wrong during the first month of an embryo's development, meaning the spinal column doesn't close fully. Cow-ld you believe it? Amar's father says the boy's 'cow-like' appearance and love for spending time with the family's cattle, is further proof that the boy is a god . Amar's family believes his tails is proof of a connection with the Hindu monkey-god Hanuman . One of Amar's older sisters holds him in the family home in Nijmapur, a small village in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India . Exactly why this happens is not known, but the most significant risk factor that has been identified is a lack of folic acid before pregnancy and in the very early weeks of pregnancy. Symptoms of the condition include learning difficulties, paralysis of the lower limbs and incontinence. Spina bifida occulta is the least serious type of spina bifida and causes just a very small opening in the spine. This opening tends to be covered with skin so the gap is not visible externally, as it can be with other forms of spina bifida. However, this skin often contains a hairy patch or a birth mark. It usually does not cause any symptoms meaning most people are unaware they have the condition. Spina bifida affects about one child in every 2,500.","Amar Singh, six, from Uttar Pradesh, northern India, has a foot-long 'tail'

"Palmistry is the ancient art of predicting the future through the reading of palm lines. The art is hugely popular in Japan where palm readers charge optimistic customers upwards of £50 a session to tell them what the future could hold, simply by looking at the markings on their hands. But and now for those not content with the fortune lines that nature gave them there is a drastic new way of trying to be master of their own destiny: by altering their palm lines through cosmetic surgery. The surgery, which has also been known to be carried out in Korea, is performed with an . electric scalpel which burns the flesh leaving a semi-permanent scar. The people of Japan, where palmistry is huge, are having their palm lines improved by cosmetic surgery to enhance their fate . A report on The Daily Beast found that between January 2011 and May this year, 37 palm . plastic surgeries have been performed at one clinic in Japan. Shonan Beauty Clinic offers the surgery for £662 but no longer advertises the treatment because they couldn't keep up with demand. Dr Matsuoka, who has performed 20 of the operations, told The Daily Beast: 'If you try to create a palm line with a . laser, it heals, and it won’t leave a clear mark. 'You have to use the . electric scalpel and make a shaky incision on purpose, because palm . lines are never completely straight. 'If you don’t burn the skin and just . use a plain scalpel, the lines don’t form. It’s not a difficult . surgery, but it has to be done right.' The procedure usually takes 10 to 15 minutes and can include between 5 to 10 lines being on the palm being altered. One clinic in Japan offers the surgery for £662 and it takes around 15 minutes to complete. Men want their financial lines lengthening and women opt for enhancement to their marriage line . Some patients use a marker pen to show the surgeon which lines they want extending prior to surgery. It takes around a month for the wounds to heal and for the new palm lines to form. Most of the patients are thirty-something men and women who have a predilection for fortune-telling. Whilst men want their money line or success line extending, women want their love/marriage line lengthening. Some women don't even have a marriage line and believe that because of this, they won't find love. Others do have a marriage line but seek another one because they believe their first one appeared too early and they missed their chance. But does it work? Dr Matsuoka gave one woman a wedding line and soon after she wrote to him saying she had married. Two other patients won the lottery after he extended their fortune lines. Despite these success stories, Matsuoka isn't, however, sure how effective the surgery really is and believes there may be a placebo effect. 'If people think they’ll be lucky, sometimes they become lucky. And it’s not like the palm lines are really written in stone — they’re basically wrinkles,' he adds. He explains that lines do change with time and even the way people use their hands can change them. Some palmisters reportedly suggest that their clients who don't want to undergo the surgery can draw the lines on their hands themselves to change their fortune. 'The placebo effect could positively . change somebody's attitude but it is not enough to justify unnecessary . surgical intervention. Try a lucky charm maybe...’ Subodh Gupta, a London-based palm reader, says the surgery is futile. 'I read about this surgery and I was very surprised. 'Even by having surgery, the lines cannot be changed. 'If you want to improve your fortune, take physical actions. So if you want greater health, do some exercise. 'I have seen people's health lines change after six months of yoga.' Dr. Yannis Alexandrides, founder, director and head of practice and surgical at 111 Harley St in London, added: ‘It is possible to have complications from this type of surgery such as infection and painful neuromas which can create a source of irritation. 'The placebo effect could positively change somebody's attitude but it is not enough to justify unnecessary surgical intervention. 'Try a lucky charm maybe.’ A high Venus shows someone who can be promiscuous and overindulgent . A flat Venus shows you have little or no interest in family life and tend to criticise others . Palmists look at qualities of the hand, such as shapes and lines of the palm and fingers, colour and texture of the skin and fingernails, as well as the sizes of the palm and fingers and knuckles .","New plastic surgery trend in Japan and Korea .

"A 28-year-old medical school student who is auctioning off her virginity on the internet has already received bids as high as $550,000, as she reveals her face in an effort to attract more hefty offers. The student, who is using the alias 'Elizabeth Raine,' launched her online auction on March 31 and initially hid her face to conceal her identity before later deciding it would help convince skeptical customers. Just a week before bidding ends on May 7, the current top bid listed on her website is $550,000. Scroll down for video . Auction: Kern offered up her virginity on a website, where she used the name Elizabeth Raine . Raine claims that while she's doing this for the money primarily, she is also attracted by the adventure, eroticism, scandal and the chance to challenge norms about virginity. She added that she's been planning the auction for a year and it's transformed her, making her more educated about prostitution, virginity and 'slut-shaming.' Raine told the Huffington Post she was born in the southwest but spent much of her childhood in Saudi Arabia because of her dad's job in the oil industry. He mom died when she was 10, which was tragic but the trauma is not the reason she is choosing this path to riches. She told news website that she's still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments. Cold feet: Kern pulled out of her online auction on Wednesday, saying she wanted to focus on her studies . 'I have a busy life. I am picky and guys were never a priority,' she said. Raine claims to have bachelor's degrees in both biology and engineering and is currently completing a combined MD/PhD program, but she's concerned her 'business venture' may get her thrown out of college if officials learn she's the 'Med School Virgin.' 'Lawyers have different opinions on whether I'd get kicked out, but one lawyer I trust believes it won't happen,' she said. She believes that she has thought of all the details and is confident she 'can execute and control' the unique 'transaction,' which will in fact take place in Australia because prostitution is illegal in the U.S. To be safe, the winner must have no STIs and be willing to wear a condom. Auction: Despite attracting a bid of $801,000, a source claims those making the offers went quiet when asked to prove their credentials . He must also not be drunk or on drugs during the encounter, attempt anal sex or treat her violently. She, however, told the Huffington Post that she is open to kissing the winning bidder, and believes she could even fall in love with the man who pays the most for her flower. 'I wouldn't rule out love, but it's very unlikely,' Raine said. Raine said while she likes older guys and tall men, she knows she can't control who wins. But she has ruled out sleeping with a woman, claiming that would be 'out of my comfort zone.' She also can't guarantee that she'll be any good in the sack. 'There will be a legal contract between us,' she said. '[The winner] may not be happy [with the sex], but he knows what he's paying for.'","The student, who is using the alias 'Elizabeth Raine,' launched her online auction on March 31 and initially hid her face to conceal her identity .

"Lee Clark can raise a smile as he imagines the vitriol that is likely to spew his way when Gus Poyet’s side visit St Andrew’s in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night, but there is still sadness at how he left Sunderland in scandal 15 years ago. ‘The tin hat may have to come out that's for sure!’ laughs Clark. ‘I think the fans won't be too complimentary about us. This was always going to be the case after what happened.’ Clark, 41, regrets his actions from earlier in his career and now views it as his responsibility to advice his younger players against making similar mistakes. Regret: Clark was sad that the t-shirt incident overshadowed the fact he enjoyed a good spell at Sunderland . The Birmingham manager was a player at the Stadium of Light for two years following a controversial £2.5million move in 1997 from his boyhood club Newcastle, where he played more than 200 games. Having provided a vital contribution from midfield as Peter Reid’s team earned promotion to the Premier League, he then made a very ill-advised decision while watching the 1999 FA Cup final at Wembley with friends from Tyneside. He pulled on a t-shirt bearing the words ‘Sad Mackem B*******’ in reference to Newcastle’s rivals and his employers. Photographers caught the moment and Clark’ s time on Wearside was over. Reid sold him to Fulham and Clark, born in Geordie heartland Wallsend, later said he had already been harbouring doubts about playing against Newcastle while wearing the red and white stripes of Sunderland. Only twice has he encountered Sunderland since, both during the 2005/06 season after he returned to Newcastle for a final campaign. He enjoyed two victories and received a reception he describes as ‘hot, very vocal’ during the 4-1 win at the Stadium of Light. He expects more of the same on Wednesday night in the Birmingham dugout. ‘Being a player at the club and the well-documented incident that made us have to leave probably adds a little bit of spice,’ Clark says. ‘I had two terrific years and that turned sour. ‘I’m now more mature and in a position where I feel it is a regrettable incident. I've had to move on from it. ‘It wasn't as if I was walking round the streets of London, it was just a matter of seconds but you can imagine the amount of camera flashes. Passionate: Clark is hoping to take Birmingham to the next level after just staying up last season . ‘I look back on it as stupidity. It's not something you should be doing. ‘The toughest thing for me is everyone forgets the job I did for them as a player. That's the biggest regret. It's difficult for me to ever go and watch a game there like my other clubs. ‘That was my choice but I'm a lot more mature now. I’ve had to pay the consequence of my action. I'd be disappointed if one of my players had done that. ‘I cannot turn back time or change the past but I can affect the future. I'd like to help players in the future.’ He adds: ‘When the draw was made the phone was red hot. Most of it was from the Newcastle end but there are still people I know from Sunderland days so it was a mixture. I don't think I'll be getting involved with anything with the Sunderland fans. ‘It is a special fixture. It’s a Premier League club and we had really good fixtures in this competition against Swansea and Stoke last year. ‘I saw Sunderland against Manchester United and it is a tough game as they looked very good. They could be a decent bet for top half of the Premier League. But I'd love to cause a shock.' VIDEO We have to improve - Van Gaal .","Clark admits wearing the derogatory shirt was unacceptable .

"The Vatican appears to be backtracking over a landmark document which said gay people had 'gifts and qualities' to offer the Catholic church after an outcry from conservative bishops. The paper - which also supported unmarried couples and divorcees - was hailed as a step forward by campaigners when it was released yesterday as part of a two-week Vatican summit on family life. But today conservatives at the conference came out fighting, accusing the paper of 'manipulating' their views - and the Vatican later issued a statement stressing it was only a 'work in progress'. Scroll down for video . Attack: Conservatives including U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke (centre) came out fighting today against a landmark Vatican document which said gay and lesbian people had 'gifts and qualities' to offer the church . Moderniser: Pope Francis (pictured leaving the synod of 200 bishops yesterday) famously said last year: 'If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?'. The conference will end on Sunday . Study: The discussions have largely been conducted behind closed doors in the walled-off state inside Rome . Catholic leaders in Rome added the paper will be amended by the time it emerges in its final form, after the synod of 200 bishops ends on Sunday. The development will come as a blow to campaigners who welcomed the statement as part of what they considered Pope Francis' increasing acceptance of people once shunned by the church. The pontiff famously said last year: 'If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?' He was named person of the year after taking office by Time magazine, which said he had pulled the papacy 'out of the palace and into the streets'. The synod - the first held about the family since 1980 - said unmarried couples living together can be 'positive' and couples' decisions on the use of contraception should be respected. The synod - the first held about the family since 1980 - said unmarried couples living together can be 'positive' and decisions on the use of contraception should be respected. Pictured: Bishops gathering yesterday . Deep in conversation: Cardinal Donald Wuerl (right) chats with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, as he leaves the Synod Hall yesterday. The final document will emerge next week . Bishops had called for 'courageous' new ways to help families, especially those 'damaged' by divorce. And their document asked rhetorically if the church was ready to provide them a place 'accepting and valuing their sexual orientation without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony.' All eyes on him: The conference is being led by Pope Francis, who is seen as a moderniser by many . Francis DeBernardo, executive director of the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry, described the move as 'a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for, for a very long time'. But today the head of the Polish bishops' conference, Cardinal Stanislaw Gadecki, called the paper 'unacceptable' and a deviation from church teaching. Hard-line American Cardinal Raymond Burke, the head of the Vatican's supreme court, claimed the Vatican was releasing 'manipulated' information about the goings-on of the synod. 'While the document purports to report only the discussion . which took place among the synod fathers, it, in fact, advances . positions which many synod fathers do not accept', he told . The Catholic World report. 'A great number of the synod fathers found it . objectionable'. Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier of South Africa added: 'It is not what we are saying at all... It is not a true message. 'The message has gone out that this is what the synod is . saying, that this is what the Catholic Church is saying ... Whatever we say hereafter will seem like we're doing damage . control.' Cardinal Reinhard Marx of Germany, however, hit back at the conservatives - calling the document 'an honest representation of how the debate developed'. The comments came out after the Vatican's summary of today's debate, which happened behind closed doors without media scrutiny. According to the summary, bishops suggested the final version of the report should highlight faithful, Catholic families to avoid 'a near-exclusive focus on imperfect family situations.' On gay Catholics, they said 'prudence' was required 'so that the impression of a positive evaluation of such a tendency on the part of the church is not created. 'The same care was advised with regard to cohabitation.' The bishops also noted that the word 'sin' barely appeared in the document at all. Today's summary also noted some bishops firmly believe there is no room for change on the issue of whether Catholics who divorce and remarry, without getting an annulment, can receive Communion. Current teaching says these Catholics are living in sin so cannot receive the sacraments. Serious issues: Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller arrives for a morning session of a two-week synod today . Seat of power: The debates have been taking place in Vatican City, the church's walled state within Rome . Yesterday's document was written by a committee of bishops after a week of . speeches.

'We broadly welcome what's come out of the Vatican in the last 24 hours and we welcome the fact that the church is now recognising there are many people in loving same-sex relationships.

"An under-the-sea themed ceremony has seen Ariel, Disney's famous mermaid princess take on a new role as The Little Mer-wife. Every little girl dreams of meeting her Prince Charming and having the perfect fairy tale wedding, and one woman has helped to make this a reality when she transformed a ceremony into an under-water fantasy. Traci Hines, from Los Angeles, took on the role of the red-headed sea-maid and even bagged herself her very own Prince Eric in order to perfect the magical day. The Little Mer-wife: Traci Hines (as Ariel) and Leo Camacho (to her right) helped to recreate the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid for a wedding shoot . The wedding was complete with seaside appetisers, a three-tier mermaid tail cake and a stunning beach backdrop and even bridesmaids shell printed t-shirts. The unique ceremony is sure to make any Ariel enthusiast swoon as not a single detail has been missed. Happily ever after: The photo shoot was created for the online wedding store, Cloud Parade . Prince Charming: The wedding naturally took place in the sea with a trail of clam shells leading up to it . Mer-bridesmaids: The colourful bridesmaids wore pastel tulle skirts and shell bra printed t-shirts . However, fans shouldn't be too envious as the somewhat perfect wedding is completely fabricated and was created as part of a photo-shoot. Traci and Leo Camacho, who played Prince Eric in the scenario, are both models and shot the photographs in collaboration with Mark Brooke Photography, Mathieu Photo and online wedding store, Cloud Parade in order to showcase their stock. Despite the fact that the wedding is purely for show, the photographs demonstrate that it is possible for fans to recreate their fantasy wedding in reality. Inspiration: The theme of the wedding was taken from the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid where a mermaid, Ariel (left) is transformed into a human in order to be with Prince Eric (right) Floundering around: The shoot appeared completely authentic with natural shots taking precedence . Up where they walk: Ariel took her human form in the wedding but her outfit obviously took inspiration from the mermaid's fishtail . I want to see them dancing: Leo who took the role of Prince Eric, was dressed casually in a pair of navy chinos and a white shirt with rolled up sleeves . Not a detail has been missed, from the diamond encrusted anchor ring that adorns her finger to the golden shell around her neck, Traci is the spitting image of the Disney heroine. Even Leo, looks the part, dressed relatively casually in a crisp white shirt and navy chinos - ensuring that all attention is on the mermaid bride. Traci's dress has no doubt taken inspiration from Ariel's fish tail as the hem is dip-dyed with a gradient of different blues. Disney decor: The wedding decorations also took an ocean theme with the colour scheme featuring mainly turquoise and green hues . Fairy tale feast: Snacks on offer included mermaid macaroons . I've got whosits and whatsits galore: Not a single detail appeared to have been missed with Traci even wearing a golden shell necklace that Ursula, the sea witch, famously wore in the film . Traci is furthermore convincing as she is pictured combing her red hair with a golden fork, mirroring the famous scene in the 1989 film. To follow the ceremony which, naturally took place on the shore of the beach, guests could enjoy a selection of ocean themed macaroons and cupcakes. To ensure that the guests' napkins don't blow away before they can tuck into their crustacean-themed snacks, they are held in place with golden starfish. The majority of the detailed props used on the shoot are available to buy at Cloud Parade so fans can create their dream wedding like never before. The only thing that the company can't offer is a Prince Charming to go with. Inspiration: Although the wedding wasn't real it demonstrates to die-hard fans that they can create their dream wedding . A seaside spread: Table decorations featured aqua sequined table cloths and golden starfish . Its a dinglehopper! Traci recreated that famous scene in The Little Mermaid where Ariel uses a fork to comb her long red hair .","Wedding boutique Cloud Parade created The Little Mermaid themed shoot .

"This is the moment a British 'freerunner' scaled the top of a bridge and performed a back-flip while hundreds of feet in the air. James Kingston, who describes himself as a 'professional adventurer', climbed 380 feet to the top of the Moscow Bridge in Kiev along with friend Mustang Wanted. The pair are then seen dangling each other over the edge of the bridge, before the nail biting footage shows Mr Kingston do a back flip without wearing any safety gear. James Kingston performed a back flip hundreds of feet in the air after climbing to the top of the Moscow Bridge in Kiev . But the stunt doesn't quite go to plan, not because he lands badly, but because after making his descent from the bridge, he falls right into the arms of local police who arrest him. The footage starts with the pair climbing the 380 feet to the top of the Moscow Bridge, not seeming to use any sort of safety equipment. Mr Kingston is then seen scaling the metal beams to reach the top platform, where he and his friend dangle over the edge - where one slip could cause the other to fall to certain death.

The British editor's decision comes as Conde Nast confirmed that all its magazines have opted to boycott the Dorchester Collection of hotels, which includes The Dorchester and 45 Park Lane, in London, as well as famous retreat Coworth Park, in Windsor. Stephen Fry was among the first British stars to announce he was joining the campaign, tweeted that he had cancelled his stay at Coworth Park. In the US, the Beverly Hills Hotel, in Los Angeles, has become a main focus for Hollywood and the fashion industry's anger after the Sultan of Brunei approved new laws which call for homosexuals and adulterers to be stoned to death. Paris hotspot: Le Meurice is a fashion industry favourite in the French capital . Boycott: All Conde Nast magazines confirmed they would not be staying at Dorchester Collection hotels, such as Le Meurice (pictured), The Dorchester and Coworth Park . Star support: Russell Crowe tweeted that he did not agree with the boycott of The Beverly Hills Hotel . Chat show hosts Ellen DeGeneres and Jay . Leno are among those who have spoken out against the properties, with . Sir Richard Branson and Sharon . Osbourne also confirming they would be avoiding the hotels. Members of the fashion industry such as shoe . designer Brian Atwood and designer Peter Som have also called for . action, as well as François-Henri Pinault, the head of Kering, which . owns Gucci, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. However, not everyone agrees with the action being taken against the hotels. Hollywood star Russell Crowe has announced that he didn't support the Hollywood boycott that has crippled business. The star wrote on Twitter that didn't agree with the boycott as it hits hard-working staff he considers  his 'friends'. Once known as the place 'to be seen', the hotel has been almost empty in recent weeks thanks to the boycott. Dissension: Russell Crowe said he did not agree with the hotel boycott . The Gladiator star Crowe tweeeted his support for workers, . saying: 'I don't agree with the boycotting of Dorchester Collection . hotels. It only hurts the hard working staff who I consider friends.' His message was greet with support on Twitter, with 102 people rewteeted the comment and 274 'favouriting' the tweet. However, not everyone agreed with the . star. Scott Holleran ‏tweeted: 'Maybe you should watch Gladiator again . for a refresher in what it truly means to persecute innocent people.' Scroll down for video . In the pink: The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a favourite retreat of Hollywood stars since it opened in 1912 - but has found itself at the centre of protests against its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, and Brunei's new anti-gay laws . A gathering storm: Celebrities such as comedian Jay Leno have led protests outside the Beverly Hills Hotel . Kevin Kane added: . 'I am married to a gay Bruniean. Giving money to the Sultan is support. Boycott leads to media interest and political pressure.' Reality . star Kim Kardashian is said to have cancelled her bridal shower at the . hotel, while the Motion Picture & Television Fund said it will no . longer hold its annual ‘Night Before the Oscars’ party at the hotel. The . Fund said it was making a protest at Brunei’s new sharia criminal law, . which punishes same-sex relationships, as well as adultery and . abortions, with flogging and stoning. ‘We . cannot condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws, and as a . result support a business owned by the Sultan of Brunei or a Brunei . sovereign fund associated with the government of Brunei,’ the Fund's . directors said in a statement. Coming under fire: Protestors have been gathering outside the Beverly Hills Hotel all week . Prominent . figures such as comedians Ellen DeGeneres and Jay Leno, and entrepreneur . Richard Branson, have been among those to advocate shunning the hotel . and its bungalows – a favoured locale for the Hollywood elite since it . opened its doors in 1912. Branson . tweeted that no member of his Virgin staff would stay at any Dorchester . Collection property ‘until the Sultan abides by basic human rights.’ Mavis . Leno, co-chair of the Global Women's Rights Awards with husband Jay . Leno, said the new penalties ‘violate international law and have no . place in civilised society.’ Flashpoint: The Dorchester Collection, which runs the Beverly Hills Hotel, says the current protests are misdirected . In an added move, the City of Beverly Hills voted to pressure the government of Brunei into selling the Beverly Hills Hotel in the wake of its new laws. Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has praised his state's laws as a ‘great achievement.’ Brunei, a conservative country where alcohol is banned and Muslim courts already govern family affairs, has begun phasing in its version of sharia law, which allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery. The most severe punishments – flogging, amputation and stoning – are to be introduced over the next two years. Response: Comedian Ellen Degeneres and entrepreneur Richard Branson have been vocal in their opposition . The Dorchester Collection's chief executive has said that the hotel boycott is misdirected. ‘American companies across the board are funded by foreign investment, including sovereign wealth funds,' Christopher Cowdray said in a statement. The Beverly Hills Hotel has played host to a constellation of stars in its 102-year history. Leading lights such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, John Wayne, Faye Dunaway and The Beatles have all stayed or partied amid the property's inimitable pink walls.","Vogue editor confirmed she would not stay at Le Meurice in Paris .

"David Cameron has branded Islamic State terrorists who killed British aid worker Alan Henning 'brutal and repulsive' as the Prime Minister led a wave of global revulsion over the murder. He vowed to 'hunt down' and bring to justice the man who wielded the knife, who has become known as Jihadi John - as Barack Obama, Nick Clegg and Muslim leaders all spoke of their disgust. Mr Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was filmed being murdered in a video posted on the internet three weeks after he was last paraded in front of a camera. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has branded the Islamic State 'brutal and repulsive' tonight after British aid worker Alan Henning was filmed being beheaded by the terrorist dubbed Jihadi John . In a strongly-worded statement, Mr Cameron said: 'We will do all we can to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice.' He added: 'My thoughts and prayers tonight are with Alan’s wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him. ‘Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need. 'The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these ISIL terrorists. David Cameron received a security briefing this morning before calling the slaying of Alan Henning 'completely unforgivable' Aid worker Alan Henning, 44, a father-of-two, was kidnapped by Islamist rebels on Boxing Day last year . This morning, Downing Street revealed that Mr Cameron was meeting with officials from the intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office at his official country residence Chequers to discuss the killing. Later this morning, he called the slaying 'completely unforgivable' adding that there was 'no level of depravity to which they will not sink'. 'No appeals made any difference,""Mr Cameron told Sky News. 'The murder of Alan Henning is absolutely abhorrent, it is senseless, it is completely unforgivable. Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is, and barbaric it is,' he said of IS. When asked whether he believed the extremists would kill more of their Western hostages, Cameron suggested the only way to stop them was through military action. 'The fact that this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they could murder him in the way they did, shows what we are dealing with,' he said. Nick Clegg took to Twitter to praise Mr Henning, saying he worked to 'selflessly help those in need' 'This is going to be our struggle now. ... We must do everything we can to defeat this organisation. We must take action against it. We must find those responsible.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg praised Mr Henning on Twitter, saying: 'Sincere condolences to Alan Henning's family. Barbaric actions of ISIL are held in complete contempt. 'We are resolved to defeat this evil. Alan Henning was a man moved to selflessly help those most in need and we should remember that above all else at this difficult time.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'The murder of Alan Henning by ISIL is appalling and barbaric. 'He was an aid worker, helping those in need. Those who killed him have revealed only their lack of humanity and brutality. 'My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his wife Barbara, his children and all those who knew him. 'We will do everything we can to support the efforts of the Government to bring those guilty of this terrible act to justice.' U.S. President Barack Obama said: 'The United States strongly condemns the brutal murder of United Kingdom citizen Alan Henning by the terrorist group ISIL. 'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family, and for the people of the United Kingdom. 'Standing together with our UK friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice. 'Standing together with a broad coalition of allies and parteners, we will continue taking decisive action to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.' The American ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun said this morning: 'Today, we stand with the UK in joint determination, resolve and commitment to achieve justice for Alan Henning.' Imams  had joined forces before Mr Henning's execution to appeal to the terrorists to release the former taxi driver from Salford, who left his job to travel to Syria to take help to victims of its civil war. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Henning 'a British hero.' His 'barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world,' Shafiq said. Dr Shuja Shafi, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: 'This reported murder is a despicable and offensive act, coming as it does on the eve of the Muslim festival of Eid Al-Adha. 'It is quite clear that the murderers of Alan Henning have no regard for Islam, or for the Muslims around the world who pleaded for his life. Barack Obama condemned the killing, and reiterated his promise to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' ISIS . 'Alan was a friend of Muslims, and he will be mourned by Muslims. In this period of Hajj and this festival of Eid, Muslims remember the mercy of God and the emphasis God places on human life. 'Alan Henning's murderers have clearly gone against that spirit of Islam. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.' Hanif Qadir, founder of Active Change Foundation – the organisation behind the #Notinmyname campaign said: 'The fact that they have chosen to commit this barbaric act on the eve of the Eid al-adha, a global expression of forgiveness and mercy among Muslims, only demonstrates the extent of the evil and barbaric nature of these criminals. 'They have not shown any ounce of mercy or compassion and are therefore totally against Islam and are hell-bent on killing innocent individuals and must be stopped. 'As a British Muslim I urge every other Muslim in the UK to stand up and refute these terrorists and distance themselves from this brutality and false Islam.' In footage released on social media, Mr Henning is shown being beheaded by Jihadi John, the Islamist fighter who was also behind the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines. Former Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim woman in the Cabinet, tweeted her condolences, saying the Mr Hennning was the 'true martyr.' Liberal Democrat party president Tim Farron said: ‘Alan Henning should be remembered for what he was - a kind hearted, selfless man who wanted to help others. My prayers are with his family.’ Inspire, an anti-extremist campaign group of British Muslim women, described Mr Henning's death as 'an affront to all Muslims across the world'. Co-director Sara Khan expressed her 'heartfelt condolences' to the family of the aid worker, who she described as an 'amazing man, a man of courage, a man of dignity, a man of integrity'. She said: 'The only thing that the killing of Alan has achieved is greater revulsion for ISIS and the fact that more people from across our world, within our communities, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, are united in their stance against their barbarity and inhumanity. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim charity, called Alan Henning (pictured) 'a British hero.' 'The murder of Alan Henning is a brutal and criminal act of terror that is an affront to all Muslims across the world.' Former head of the Army, General The Lord Dannatt said the deaths of hostages were sadly 'part of the harsh price' to be paid in confronting the 'abomination' of IS. 'Our Government is now standing up to its responsibilities and part of the harsh price, while this takes time, is that sadly if they have hostages in their hands, these atrocious things seem to be happening and seem to be going to continue to happen,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. He renewed his call for the UK to extend military operations to Syria, where the US and other allies are conducting air strikes, saying this country was 'practically not doing enough'. 'Dealing with half a problem is not going to solve the problem,' he said. 'If the Americans have found a way to be able to do this then actually we should be doing it.' This morning, Mr Cameron met with officials from the intelligence agencies, the military and the Foreign Office at his official country residence Chequers to discuss the killing. Afterwards, a Downing Street statement said the Prime Minister had raised a second video showing a British ISIL fighter unmasked delivering a further message - and that police were investigating 'urgently' for 'possible terrorism offences' relating to it. A second video, published by Islamic State last night, shows an injured British fighter challenging David Cameron to send ground troops to Iraq. The fighter is believed to be a former Morrisons security guard who flew to Syria . It comes after footage emerged last night of an injured British fighter challenging David Cameron to send ground troops to Iraq. In a rant directed at ‘that despicable swine David Cameron’, the unmasked jihadi said: ‘Send them all, send your reserves and your backup and we’ll send them back one by one in coffins.’ It is understood the jihadist in the video is former supermarket security guard Omar Hussain. The 27-year-old from High Wycombe previously worked for Morrisons as a security guard. He lived with his mother and brothers before travelling to Syria in January 2014. The Downing Street statement said: 'The PM was clear that we must keep doing all we can to ensure that these terrorists are found and brought to justice for their heinous crimes and we will keep working with our US partners and those in the region to do this. 'ISIL’s brutality will not persuade us to change our approach. 'Indeed, the senseless murder of an innocent man only reinforces our resolve to defeat this terrorist organisation and to eradicate the threat they pose to Britons - whether those in the region or here on the streets of the UK. 'At the meeting, the Prime Minister also raised a second video released last night which shows an apparent British ISIL fighter unmasked delivering a further message. 'The police are urgently investigating the contents of the video, including possible terrorism offences relating to it.'","David Cameron vows to hunt down terrorists behind Mr Henning's killing .

"A new television show will feature couples having sex in a sound-proofed box in a television studio with audience and then being interviewed about it afterwards. Three couples, two straight and one gay, will take turns to step into the opaque box before being quizzed about what they got up to by host Mariella Frostrup and a panel of sex experts. Makers of the show, called Sex Box, claim that the programme, which will air on Channel 4, is intended to 'reclaim sex from pornography'. Controversial: Couples who have just had sex in a box in a television studio will be interviewed by (L-R) panellists Phillip Hodson, Tracey Cox, Dan Savage and host Mariella Frostrup on Channel 4's new show Sex Box . Frostrup, 50, said she hoped the show would spark a 'mature, intelligent discussion about sex in Britain today. 'I approached it with great trepidation and a degree of scepticism, particularly about why we needed a box, but ultimately I think it was a really, really mature - surprisingly for television - look at a subject we've allowed to proliferate in its worst manifestations and refuse to confront,' she said. 'The sex we see on screen, in magazines and increasingly online bears little relation to the real experiences of real people - this will be a frank conversation about an essential element in all our lives.' The first couple to use the 'sex box' for the pre-recorded, hour-long show, which will air on October 7, is 20-somethings Rachel and Dean.  They will be followed by Matt and John, who are in a long-term relationship, and childhood sweethearts Lynette and Des. The couples, whose time in the box will not be filmed, will speak to a panel including television sex expert Tracey Cox, relationship expert Dan Savage, and psychotherapist and author Phillip Hodson. Cox said: 'The Box itself is a unique way to get peoples' attention and to recognise that sex is a normal part of all our lives and something we need to be talking about openly and honestly.' The programme is part of a season called Campaign For Real Sex which begins on September 30 with a show called Porn On The Teenage Brain, an examination of pornography by former lads' mag editor Martin Daubney. Keeping it real: Makers of the programme say ordinary people's sex lives are not represented in pornography . Mature: Mariella Frostrup, 50, will host Sex Box, where couples are interviewed after having sex in the studio . Other shows in the series, which begins on September 30, include a documentary about women and sex called The Week The Women Came and another in which pornography fans meet the stars of their favourite films, called Date My Porn Star. Channel 4's head of factual programming Ralph Lee told MailOnline: 'The idea of the box is that it will facilitate a conversation that's more immediate, more honest and more truthful than if we didn't have it. 'It's not about the technicalities of sex but more about discussing what it means to them as a couple.' - Ralph Lee, Channel 4's head of factual programming . 'It's not about the technicalities of sex but more about discussing what it means to them as a couple.  There has been a massive explosion of pornography but what there hasn't been is a conversation about real sex in people's lives today. 'This will add context to pornography.' He said it had not been hard to find couples willing to appear on the show but producers had had to work to make sure they did not use exhibitionists. 'Those who appear have a personal reason for doing so - perhaps some felt that their sex lives were not represented in the media, so it was a chance to show the sort of sex they have', he said.

According to Korean sites Onboa and Munhwa, some hospitals have resorted to handing out ‘plastic surgery certificates’ to patients to enable them to get home. These certificates are said to include the patient’s passport number, the name of the hospital they were treated at and the length of their visit to South Korea. The theory goes that these certificates can smooth their path through passport control. While hospitals have been aware of the problem for a number of years, it is said to be becoming an increasingly common issue. In 2009, 23 Chinese women are said to have struggled to return to China from South Korea after undergoing surgery. Some hospitals in South Korea are now offering 'plastic surgery certificates' to smooth patients' paths through passport control when they no longer look like their passport photos . Women who've had plastic surgery in South Korea often end up with larger eyes, higher noses and thinner chins . The women were stopped at passport control because they were noted to have bigger eyes, higher noses and slimmer chins than were shown on their passports, China Daily reported. After careful checks had been carried out, the women were allowed into China but they were all advised to renew their passports immediately. 'After they took off their huge hats and big sunglasses following our request, we saw them looking different, with bandages and stitches here and there,' Shanghai Hongqiao Airport officer Chen Tao told China Daily. 'We had to compare their uncorrected parts with their photos very carefully,' he added. Some women are having to renew their passports after surgery so as to have a new photo included . South Korea is rapidly becoming the home of plastic surgery and people there have the most cosmetic procedures per head of population, according to global figures released last year by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. Indeed, one in every 77 people in South Korea now goes under the knife or needle in a bid to improve their looks. Shockingly, some 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in Seoul admit to going under the knife and one of the most popular procedures involves reducing excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and more 'Western'. It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes.","Some hospitals in South Korea are offering 'plastic surgery certificates' to help overseas patients through passport control on their way home .

"The 15-year-old son of CNN president Jeff Zucker has resigned from his position on the advisory board of Cory Booker's start-up after it was revealed that the teenager had a leadership role in the company and receiving stock options for his work. Hours after the news broke that Zucker's teenage son Andrew was listed as a member of the video aggregation start-up, a CNN spokesman said that he resigned from the company. The spokesperson also made a concerted effort to distance Booker, the current Newark mayor who is running for the open New Jersey Senate seat, from the decision to bring the younger Zucker on board. Her idea: Sarah Ross is said to be the one who approached Jeff Zucker's son Andrew (seen with his father at left in 2009) to be a member of the advisory board of Cory Booker's start-up Waywire . Public face: Cory Booker, the current mayor of Newark, New Jersey who is now running for Senate, is the founder of a video aggregation start up and he stands to make $1million to $5million out of the company . They said instead that it was Sarah Ross, a tech executive with close ties to Silicon Valley, who approached Andrew and asked him to provide some analysis for the Booker's start-up Waywire because the teenager is apparently known for his insight into popular trends among teens. Teenage tech whiz: Andrew Zucker, seen in 2009, resigned from his post on the company's board hours after the news broke . CNN Money reported on Wednesday that Andrew's name was suggested to Ms Ross by another Waywire board member after they heard that the teen had been helping his dad when it came to tech branding issues for the cable news giant. Ms Ross then had a conversation with both Jeff and Andrew Zucker and they agreed to have the now-15-year-old sign on to Waywire's advisory board and receive a 'de minimus' amount of stock options in return. An unidentified source told CNN Money that Booker himself was 'not involved at all' with the decision, and Ms Ross herself admitted at an early stage that the politician would not be a part of the day-to-day operations of the start up. The New York Times reports that even in the nascent phase, it was clear among the founders that Booker would be a more public role. When . the launched the company, Ms Ross reportedly said to Booker: 'You know . what? You should do it, found the company. Obviously you don’t have to . be involved — you’ve got a full-time job. But found the company.’ The . financial disclosure indicates that his ownership stake could earn him . anywhere between $1million and $5million, but the company does not . appear anywhere near ready to turn over such a profit. Unlike many of the other boldface names connected to Waywire, like Oprah Winfrey and Google's Eric Schmidt, it does not seem as if the elder Zucker actually has any financial stake in the company. Very little has previously been revealed about the start up, which was officially created in May 2012. Promoting the brand: If  Booker wins, he will have to resign from the board of Waywire and stop promoting it from his well-followed Twitter feed . Famous funders: Google's Eric Schmidt (left) was the first one to invest money in Waywire, and Booker's close friend Oprah Winfrey (right) followed shortly after . Now The New York Times . was able to shed some light on the company's structure because Booker . had to submit a financial report showing his ownership of the company . due to the stipulations for Senate candidates. Booker . reportedly came up with the idea for the company, whose mission is to . effectively become a different iteration of YouTube where the work of . up-and-coming students is highlighted, while meeting with Ms Ross and . Nathan Richardson. Ms Ross . is best known for her work behind the social media scenes, and is . credited by The Times as being the one that helped Ashton Kutcher . achieve his record-breaking number of followers. 'I . see high school kids who are doing incredible videos, but their voices . are not breaking into the national conversation,' Booker said of his . inspiration for Waywire. Connected: Sarah Ross, seen here talking with Booker and trailed by Mark Zuckerberg, is well known in Silicon Valley . Booker's . involvement in the project has not been a secret, as he used his name . and public image as a way to gain more than a million dollars from early . investors. He said it was . easy to raise the $1.75million worth of seed money for the venture . 'because of the power of the idea'. He said nothing of his rising power . on the national political stage. Schmidt was the first investor in the company, and Booker's close friend Oprah followed suit. For . Booker's part, he may not be able to be involved in the company much . longer. If he wins the Senate race in November, he will be forced to . withdraw from Waywire's board. The Times reports that they already had to go through a round of layoffs, but two staffers taht are still around are Andrew Zucker and an unidentified son of one of a Booker supporter who is now employed by Booker's Senate campaign.","Cory Booker helped found a video aggregation start up site called Waywire .

"An extreme kayaker who was killed after she was overtaken by powerful rapids was being profiled by '60 Minutes Sports' at the time of her death, it has emerged. Shannon Christy, a 23-year-old experienced kayaer, was preparing for the Great Falls Race on the Potomac on July 11 when she encountered trouble in the first drop - one of the steepest in the world. Her kayak was found drifting downstream and her body was eventually recovered from beneath tons of water in a deadly section of the run. Organizers called off the competition following the tragedy. Christy's death came just two days after the 60 Minutes crew interviewed and filmed her during her first practice run on the Class Five Rapid, which is the most dangerous category. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Shannon Christy, a 23-year-old extreme kayaker, was killed in the rapids on the Potomac River two days after filming this interview with 60 Minutes Sports. She was preparing for a competition . Feat: The profile shows her tackling one of the world's biggest drops - and grinning when she climbs out . She was filmed grinning with exhilaration after she finished the first run before sitting down with the crew to talk about the dangers of the sport. 'We have all been in situations where you've had to pull your spray skirt and be ejected form the kayak,' she said. 'It's not something that's ideal or what you want to do, but it does happen to the best of the best.' On the video she is also heard discussing one area of the run - the 'Subway' - and another kayaker warns her to keep away from it. It was here that she lost control two days later. The rapids were so forceful that they had pulled her from the kayak, leaving her to swim, which is a situation kayakers seek to avoid. Her friend Will Seeber was with her when he saw her being swept away. THIS EPISODE AIRS ON SHOWTIME THROUGHOUT OCTOBER. CHECK SCHEDULE HERE. Tragedy: The documentary makers saw her kayak floating down the river just after she was swept away . Massive: On the profile, she was warned against one area of the rapids - and it was this area where she died . He 'attempted to come to her aid, but could not reach her in time before the fast-moving currents pulled Shannon into ""Subway"",'  according to a statement released by Active Nature, the sponsor of the event. She became pinned under the water and drowned, authorities said. The powerful water had also ripped off her flotation device and her helmet. She had previously written on her blog, which documents her love of the water, about the dangers of coming out of the kayak. 'You're so much safer in your boat than out of it,' she wrote. 'Learn your roll and make it solid.' The Showtime profile, which includes the interview and footage from the recovery of her body, will air on Wednesday at 10pm and then repeat again throughout the month. Loss: Christy was an experienced kayaker who worked for a kayak manufacturing company in South Carolina . Joy: Images on her social networking sites show her grinning as she takes part in extreme watersports . Following her death, the kayak event was canceled, and in its place, dozens of kayakers came together to honor and remember the sportswoman, who was from Greenville, South Carolina. 'She would always bring a smile to the rivers and it was great to paddle with her,' friend Pat Keller said. But he added that the tragedy would not put them off going back in the water, the Washington Post reported. 'For what we receive for playing on the waters and dancing with an element that is so much more powerful than us, it’s worth going out again and again and again,' he said. Funloving: Friends remembered her as always smiling and being great to ride with on the rapids . Missed: Christy, pictured with her mother, was found pinned beneath water and could not be saved . After college, Christy had worked for a kayak and canoe manufacturer in Greenville while traveling the country seeking whitewater runs. Friends also recounted the massive effort to save her, with one kayaker, Jeff McIntyre, telling WUSA9: 'It was nothing . short of a heroic effort.' Christy became the third kayaker to drown in . the area since 1998, according to the Potomac Paddlers Volunteer Corps, which promotes safety on . the river.

"Syria's First Lady made a public appearance for the first time in months at an event in Damascus - dispelling rumours that she had fled her war-torn nation to safety abroad. British-born Asma Assad brought her two sons Hafez, 11, and Karim, eight, and her daughter Zein, nine, along to the Mothers of Martyrs event at the opera house in the capital, according to the President's office. She greeted a crowd of women and children with Syrian flags painted on their faces at the charity event, in aid of the mothers of dead soldiers. Asma al-Assad made a rare public appearance at the Mothers of Martyrs in the Damascus Opera House, dispelling rumours she had fled Syria or that she was expecting her fourth child . Syria's first lady had not been seen in public for some months and had been rumoured to be in the United Arab Emirates with her husband's mother and sister . Mrs Assad had not appeared in public for months prior to the event and Syrians suspected she had fled abroad with her children to escape the violence after fighting reached Damascus. President Assad's mother, Anisa Maklouf, and sister, Bushra, whose husband was killed in a bombing last July, are reported to have fled to the United Arab Emirates. Speculation had also mounted in recent months that Mrs Assad was heavily pregnant, after a Lebanese newspaper reported she was expecting her fourth child. Speculation had mounted that Asma Assad had fled abroad to safety after fighting reached the capital in Damascus . The absence of Asma Assad's from the public eye was originally thought to signify her disapproval of President Assad's violent regime .

She was privately educated in Marylebone and graduated from Kings College London before working for a merchant bank and marrying President Assad in 2000. She became known for her support of good causes and when she disappeared from the public eye after the uprising two years ago many thought this was a sign she disapproved of her husband's barbaric dictatorship. But leaked emails obtained by the Mail last July showed Mrs Assad went on a £270,000 online shopping spree as Syrian soldiers and rebels were dying in a violent war under her husband's rule, while one million more became refugees. Her order – which included five . chandeliers costing £8,800 – was sent to upmarket furniture store DN Designs in . the King’s Road, Chelsea, West London.

"Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland striker John Aldridge has picked his #one2eleven of stars he has played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club. It is no surprise that Aldridge has included his old strike partner Ian Rush, who scored a total of 346 goals during his two spells at Anfield.

GOALKEEPER: Bruce Grobbelaar . 'Bruce was a great goalkeeper. He was very eccentric in the sort of things he did, but shot-stopping, use of his box, his kicking... he had everything. He was different class.' Bruce Grobbelaar in action for Liverpool during a match against Chelsea in December 1989 . RIGHT-BACK: Steve Nicol . 'What a player. He was a greyhound, he could run all day. He's a right-back who could score goals for fun. He would give you ten goals a year without penalties. And he was great in the dressing room.' CENTRE-BACK: Paul McGrath . 'He is the hardest defender I have ever played against. A true gentleman. When we beat Italy 1-0 in the giant stadium in the 1994 World Cup, if any young lad is aspiring to be a centre-half, get the DVD of that game and watch Paul McGrath. It was the best performance I have ever seen, he had [Roberto] Baggio in his pocket for 90 minutes. He was absolutely awesome.' CENTRE-BACK: Alan Hansen (captain) 'The amount of silverware he won as a captain and a player speaks for himself. He had the proper football brain, read the game unbelievably. He didn't like been roughed up but he read the game impeccably. Good in the air, fantastic on the ground but what he was magnificent at was coming into the midfield areas and even further up the park and scoring goals.' Liverpool's Alan Hansen passes the ball during the FA Charity Shield match against Everton in 1986 . LEFT-BACK: Mark Lawrenson . 'He was brilliant. One of the best tacklers and the best reader of a game I've ever seen. He had long legs but if you needed someone to get a little toe on the end of the ball to get it away, Lawro's your man. He was a fabulous player, very elegant.' RIGHT WING: Ray Houghton . 'Ray was a very intelligent footballer, he really was. He was just so brainy. Jack [Charlton, the former Republic of Ireland manager] didn't know his dad came from Donegal. When Jack picked me, I told him about Ray Houghton and he said ""bring him along, he can have a game as well"".' CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Liam Brady . 'He was fabulous. One of the best left foots you are likely to ever see in world football.' CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Roy Keane . 'He is a man mountain. People questioned his temperament but you are talking about a winner and a born leader. It's in his blood. Very passionate about the game.' LEFT WING: John Barnes . 'He's the best player I have ever played alongside. Give the ball to Barnsey, get in the box, go far stick and it's going to come in. At that time, he was one of the best players in the world for me.' STRIKER: Peter Beardsley . 'Genius. [He would] score 15 goals a season, create 10 goals a season. Peter was tremendous. He linked up great with Gary Lineker at England. He had a great combination with Barnsey at Liverpool as well. Great tricks as well.' STRIKER: Ian Rush . 'I have got to put Rushy up there.

"They say two is company, three's a crowd and four is a party. But a new saying will have to be invented for mother-to-be Alexandra Kinova, who will give birth to five babies this weekend. Ms Kinova, 23, revealed her huge bump to Czech media, showing just how much she has grown to accommodate her brood. Maternal: Alexandra Kinova peers over her huge baby bump. She is just days away from delivery . Slim chances: Experts say the likelihood of naturally conceiving quintuplets is one in several million . Unknown quantity: The young mother was told she was carrying twins in January. Doctors then thought there were four babies in April . Revealed: Ms Kinova has been able to sleep on her side as her pregnancy has progressed . The quins have already made history as the Czech Republic's first ever set. The bumper brood are to be delivered by Caesarean section this Sunday. Ms Kinova beat staggering odds to become pregnant with quintuplets without using IVF. Ms Kinova, who already has one son, did not realise she was carrying five babies until last month. At . first doctors said she was having twins but in March staff at the . Prague Institute for the Care of Mother and Child said she was actually . pregnant with four childre. However, it was not until the following month that she finally discovered she was having quintuplets. Ms Kinova, from Milovice, about 30 km east of Prague, told Czech news site denik.cz that she was in shock when she was told. Alexandra Kinova, 23, gave birth to four sons and a daughter by Caesarean section today . Surprise: The mother-of-one said she burst into tears when she doctors found a fifth baby . Hidden: Two of the unborn babies are hidden behind the front three . She said: 'When we finally found a fifth head, I started to cry.' According to local media, her children will be the country's first set of quins. The odds of conceiving quins naturally is one is several million, according to experts. The mother said both she and her partner have a family history of twins. Ms Kinova's birth went 'without complication' and she and her brood are in intensive care . She said aside from four months of morning sickness, she has had few complications in the pregnancy. Ms Kinova said she has been able to sleep on her side and has not had any problems with her breathing. And she said she plans to breastfeed all five, as she did with her first-born son. She told denik: 'The first child I nursed for almost a year and a half and I want to breastfeed now. 'While I know that some will be on artificial nutrition.' Ms Kinova said despite the best efforts of the doctors they still do not know the sex of all the babies. Two of the unborn babies are hidden underneath the other three - two boys and a girl, who she plans to call Daniel, Michael and Tereza. She said: 'I very much look forward to seeing how . they will look. It's a great charm, but we cannot see anything properly - . only a head or legs.' The hospital will double the number of doctors and midwives for her Caesarean. They said they have administered drugs to help speed up the development of the babies' lungs but they cannot be sure of their condition until they are born. Dr Alena Měchurová, head of the hospital, said they hope that all five babies and the mother will be fine but said they cannot rule out complications. One of the Garcia quintuplets born that weigh only 3 pounds each . The odds of conceiving quintuplets naturally is one in several million, according to Dr Wright Bates, from the University of Alabama. He told ABC News that quins are 'exceedingly rare.' Dr Bates said twins are born in up to one in every 100 births, while triplets are one in every 7,000 to 10,000 births. Naturally conceived quadruplets are born in every one in 600,000 births. The first recorded set of quintuplets known to have all survived were the Dionne sisters, who were born in Ontario, Canada. Fewer than 10 sets of quintuplets are born every year in the United States. Last month, Guillermina and Fernando Garcia had five babies – three girls and two boys – who weighed between 2 to 3 pounds each at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City for another six weeks. In 2010, British mother Vicky Lamb had four girls and two boys after taking a fertility drug but sadly one of the babies died.","Alexandra Kinova, 23, was initially told she was having twins .

"USA goalkeeper Tim Howard was the busiest goalkeeper in World Cup history on Tuesday night as Belgium hammered at his goal but there was no way the stopper was going to be beaten. The American was forced to make 16 saves - the most in a World Cup game since records began in 1966 -  and was in inspired form. Nothing was going to get past him as the stopper produced one of the greatest American goalkeeping displays in World Cup history. Single-handedly forcing the tie into extra-time, whatever Belgium threw at him, the 35-year-old was up to the task; save after save after save.

With the attacking talents of Eden Hazard, Divock Origi, Dries Mertens all peppering his goal Howard was in the form of his life and showed his prowess between the sticks. On the hour mark, Howard's shutout became intriguing as his Everton team-mate Kevin Mirallas was introduced for the Red Devils. Would the Toffee frontman's know-how of how the Blues stopper operates see Belgium take lead? No chance. Mirallas found himself clean through on goal minutes after coming on but was denied by the left boot of Howard as the keeper stayed big, stopping everything that was thrown at him. Commanding his goal with authority, Howard was often left with little help from the back-line employed to protect him and had to bellow at his team-mates on more than one occasion. Unfortunately USA's one-man show couldn't . go on forever and Belgium finally broke the deadlock as former Chelsea . man Kevin De Bruyne turned cleverly to create space for himself in the . box and struck the ball past Howard and into the far corner of . the net. After acting like a brick wall for the . entire opening ninety minutes, Howard was helpless to stop Belgium from . doubling their advantage as Romelu Lukaku, who played with the keeper at Goodison Park last term, powerfully curled the ball inside the post. Following . the match, the performance of America's No 1 - perhaps one of the best . goalkeeping displays in recent World Cup history - had clearly impressed . Belgium captain Vincent Kompany who tweeted: 'Two words: TIM HOWARD. Respect.' VIDEO Belgium leave it late again .

Finally beaten: Howard is helpless to deny Kevin de Bruyne who fired home to give Belgium the lead . Super sub: Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku unleashes an exquisite finish to double Belgium's advantage . Dejected: Howard's heroics were to no avail as Belgium emerged 2-1 victors and progressed from the last-16 . Meanwhile, USA manager Jurgen Klinmann paid tribute to Howard and said: 'What Tim played tonight was just phenomenal, outstanding - he kept us in that game for a long time. We are proud to have him with us. 'It was an absolutely amazing match tonight and you can give him the biggest compliment in the world.' After some sterling saves and one of the performances of his career, it's a shame Howard had to be on the losing side as his World Cup dream came to an end. At the age of 35, Howard may have one last summer tournament in him - and who could deny him that chance having performed so courageously for the Stars and Stripes. Now though, after . a well-deserved break, Howard's focus will return to club action with Everton . and Toffees supporters will hope their main man . between the sticks can take his World Cup form long into the new Premier .

"Belgium boss Marc Wilmots admits the closing stages of his side's 2-1 extra-time victory over USA were no good for his heart rate. After a thrilling last-16 match that was goalless at 90 minutes, former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne and substitute Romelu Lukaku gave the Belgians a two-goal lead before Julian Green pulled one back for Jurgen Klinsmann’s men with 12 minutes to go. ‘For my heart, please don’t give me too many games like this,’ said Wilmots, who must now get his team ready for a last-eight tie in Brasilia on Saturday against Argentina, who earlier beat Switzerland with a late extra-time winner of their own from Angel Di Maria.

He said: 'We had a lot of opportunities, and we dominated the game, and in the end it was well deserved even if it was scary with the US goal. 'Lukaku had been much criticised, and I told him, ""do not worry - the second round might be your day"", and that's what happened. 'Tom Howard had a fantastic match but we need to forget about this match and focus on Argentina. 'There shouldn't be any more worries from the media about us not playing football.' Lukaku himself was modest about his impact, saying: 'I'm not the hero - it's the team that is. There are many players who have made a big difference since the start of this competition.'","Extra-time goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku give Belgium 2-1 victory .

"Young British women have better qualifications than men and think their jobs are 'worthwhile,' but are still earning less, according to a new survey. Published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the research was carried out on 16-24 year old men and women in Britain between 2011 and 2013. 81 per cent of women, compared with 77 per cent of men said what they do in life is worthwhile. According to new research from the Office of National Statistics, women aged 16-24 are happier overall than men in the same age bracket, but less satisfied with their income and living conditions . However young men were more likely to report low levels of anxiety - 66 per cent compared with 63 per cent of young women. Statistics from the Department for Education show that in England attainment by age 19 at both National Qualifications Framework Level 2 and Level 3 was higher for women than for men. In 2012, 87 per cent  of young women had attained Level 2 by age 19, compared with 81 per cent of young men. Furthermore, statistics from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that a higher proportion of women students obtained a first or upper second class first degree than men in 2012/13 (70 per cent  compared with 65 per cent). But despite their academic achievements, young women are not as satisfied with their income as young men. This could well be down to the fact that men tend to be paid more and are more likely to be employed on a full-time basis. When asked if they were satisfied with their household income, 55 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women said that they were. Just 22 per cent of women reported that they were living comfortably, compared to 26 per cent of men, possibly because a higher proportion of lone parent households are headed by a woman. Young men are less likely to have higher education and qualifications than women, but still earn more and are more likely to be in full-time employment, according to new research from the Office for National Statistics . Both young men and women reported that they found managing their finances ‘difficult’ or ‘very difficult.’ Men are more likely to be satisfied with their overall health than young women, but women are more likely to report some symptoms of depression or anxiety (26 per cent compared with 16 per cent). They are also are more likely to have someone they can rely on: When questioned, 86 per cent of woman said that they had someone they could talk to. The figure was a lower 78 per cent for men. The Mental Health Foundation said: ‘Men are often particularly reluctant to talk about emotional issues. ‘Friendship is a crucial element in protecting our mental health.’ This study is just the first in a series of measures taken by the ONS into looking at national well-being for people aged 16-24. The new proposed set of measures was drafted in March and, say the ONS, work is ongoing in this area. ‘We will publish an update taking into account data availability and ongoing feedback,’ states the research. ‘The figures detailed in this article are an initial analysis of selected draft measures of young people’s well-being which considers whether there is a difference between young men and young women.’","Office for National Statistics reported 63 per cent of women are anxious .

"These are the chilling selfies a female serial killer and her alleged accomplice took while the pair were on the run from police. Joanna Dennehy, 31, has admitted stabbing three men in the heart and dumping their bodies in ditches. The bodies of her three victims were found in fields near to Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in March and April last . year. Scroll down for video . Joanna Dennehy, 31, poses for a photo with a terrifying knife while she was on the run for stabbing three men in the heart . Joanna Dennehy poses in another shocking photo with her top lifted, exposing her underwear. The woman has admitted killing three and the attempted murder of two others . Despite killing the three, Dennehy . remained unsatisfied and fled to Hereford in search of more victims, a . jury heard. She cruised the city and selected two other men at random, stabbing Robin Bereza, 64, and John . Rogers, 56, who survived the cold-blooded attacks. Alleged conspirators Gary 'Stretch' Richards, 47, and Leslie Layton, 37, who are now on trial at Cambridge Crown Court, deny helping to cover up the 'terrible truth' of the murders. Pictures of Dennehy and Richards were shown to the court as Mark Lloyd, an associate of the man, gave evidence. Georgina Page, a friend of Dennehy’s, also gave evidence today. The shocking images include one of Dennehy jovially sticking her tongue out as she brandishes a jagged knife with handcuffs attached to her trousers. In another the killer is pictured revealing her underwear and standing in a provocative sexual position in the days after committing her crimes. It shows a series of horrendous scars caused by the mother’s relentless self-harming. Joanna Dennehy's alleged co-conspirator Gary 'Stretch' Richards poses for a photo.

And in another two pictures the defendant and Mr Lloyd are seen sticking their middle fingers up. A final image shows the pair casually leaning on a fence just minutes before Dennehy tried to stab another two men to death. Dennehy, . of Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, pleaded guilty to the . three murders and two attempted murders at the Old Bailey in November. She also admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of all three . victims and is in custody awaiting sentencing. Her victims were her lover Kevin Lee, 48, his friend Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, and housemate John Chapman, 56. Mark Lloyd (left) and Gary Richards poses for a photo. Moments later, Dennehy tried to stab another two men to death . Richards of Orton Goldhay, . Peterborough, denies three counts of preventing the lawful and decent . burial of a body and two counts of attempted murder. Leslie . Layton, 37, of Orton Goldhay, denies two counts of preventing the . lawful and decent burial of a body and one count of perverting the . course of justice. A third man Robert Moore, 56, of Peterborough, has admitted assisting an offender and is awaiting sentence. As the pictures were showed to the jury today, Mr Lloyd revealed he had been forced to watch on helplessly as Dennehy tried to kill two strangers in Hereford. Mr Lloyd, who met Dennehy at a friend’s flat in Kington, Herefordshire, on April 1, shortly before the attempted murders, told the court she stank of blood. He said she told him: ‘I’ve killed three people, Gary helped dispose of them and I want to do some more. I want some fun.’ Richards swears at the camera and sticks his tongue out . Mr Lloyd said Dennehy became flirtatious with him before asking him to come in the car when she carried out the attacks. He said: ‘She was caressing my backside and running her hand down my neck. It was like being touched by a rattlesnake.’ Mr Lloyd said he watched helplessly as Dennehy was driven around Hereford looking for people to kill. He . described the two attacks on random dogwalkers as like a scene from the . film Psycho: ‘It was frenzied. She just went absolutely mad. 'She takes a knife out of her . left pocket with her right hand. She strikes him like in the film . Psycho, just like that. Thrusting and putting her whole weight behind . it. 'I just kept saying ""what the f*ck is going on, I haven’t signed up for this."" 'Gary is seeing exactly what I’m seeing and there’s just no emotion from him at all.' Victims Lukasz Slaboszewski (left) and Kevin Lee - who were stabbed in the heart by Dennehy . Mr Lloyd said Dennehy returned to the car and kissed Stretch on the cheek 'as if to say thanks'. He said the second attack was a 'brutal re-run' of the stabbing just moments earlier. John Chapman was also stabbed to death by the 31-year-old . After the second knife attack Mr Lloyd said Dennehy returned with the victim’s dog in her arms and declared it was her new pet. Mr Lloyd said: 'It was terrified of her. It was physically shaking on her lap. She wanted to take the dog for a walk.' He . added that Dennehy treated 7ft 3in Stretch 'like a puppy' and said the . giant would be dead if the killer hadn’t needed him to drive her around. Georgina Page then told the court how she and Dennehy became friends while serving jail sentences together. She said she next saw her former cell mate when she and Stretch turned up on her doorstep in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, following the murders. She said: 'When I was inside with her she wasn’t a murderer or nothing. At first I didn’t believe her. 'I was very shocked. I was scared, I didn’t know what to do.' The court also heard that during the pair’s stay at Ms Page’s house Dennehy was 'jumping around' in delight at seeing her face on the news. Ms Page said the killer downed whisky and ate a ham sandwich while bragging about her violent acts. She said: 'I was terrified. Stretch turned round and said that if anyone grassed on them he would get his dad to sort them out. Picutred is the knife used by Joanna Dennehy to attack her five victims. The later two men survived the attacks . 'Joanna was talking about something and saying ""you know we’re going to get caught and sent to jail for a long time"".' She also said Dennehy compared herself and Stretch to 'Bonnie and Clyde' whose gang killed nine policeman in 1930s America. Killer: Joanna Dennehy stabbed three men in a 10-day spree of violence . And . when she asked her why she had killed, Dennehy responded: 'They . shouldn’t have pissed me off, they shouldn’t have flirted with me' A picture of the knife believed to be used in all five attacks was also shown to court and described as a nine-inch fold knife. Mr Lloyd said he saw the same knife in Dennehy’s hands at a flat in Hereford occupied by his friend Moby. It was there that Dennehy took pictures of herself and Stretch as they prepared to drive round the city in a bid to kill again. Mr Lloyd told the jury that the blade 'was as black as the handle' because of all the congealed blood and that it 'smelt like copper'. He said Dennehy than told him: 'I’ve killed three people, Gary’s helped dispose of them and I want to do some more. You’ve had your fun Gary, I want my fun.' Mr Lloyd also revealed that Dennehy flirted with him and 'caressed' his neck and backside. He told the court she said: 'I wish I could have met you last year, your my type of guy' He said that Stretch 'was not liking it one bit' before the three of them got into the green Vauxhall Astra that the killer had travelled in from Peterborough. Mr Lloyd then said he tried to call the police while Stretch drove around Hereford looking for victims for Dennehy. But he failed to do so and told a court that 'Gary was the taxi driver, she went around killing people'. The trial continues.

The Montenegro international, signed from Fiorentina for £22m in 2013, could now be set to depart the club after he was chosen as the fall guy to allow £28m Bony into the group. Jovetic, whose time at City has been disrupted by injuries, has begun only 18 games in 19 months.

"A Florida pizzeria has an answer to the state's growing wild Burmese python problem: eat them. Evan's Neighborhood Pizza offers an outlandish pie that features the slithering reptile as a topping. It's called the Everglades and curious carnivores can also get the pie with frog legs and alligator. Owners Evann and Avis Daniell concocted the idea a couple of years ago as news that Burmese pythons were invading the Everglades was just becoming well known. Everglades pie: A Fort Myers pizza shop offers this delectable dish--a pie with frog, alligator and python . Since the reptiles were becoming such a nuisance, why not just start putting them on a pizza? 'I'm very adventurous when it comes to food, that's for sure,' Evan Daniell, 52, told the New York Daily News. Evan got to working and came up with the Everglades pie: an eclectic mix of ingredients found in the nearby wetlands. The most exotic among those ingredients is the python, which Daniell says is so gamey it must be marinated. Only slightly less weird are the frog legs, which are much cleaner-tasting even than chicken according to the pizza maker. Easting their problems: Evan's Neighborhood Pizzeria owners Evan and Avis Daniell say the idea for the pizza come to them while discussing the python problem in Florida's Everglades . Ingredients: The python (left) must be marinated to remove the gamey flavor, frog legs (top) offer a more elegant flavor, and alligator sausage (top right) adds some local flair. The swamp cabbage (circles at right) are like hearts of palm and tomatoes finish off the pie . A blend of alligator and spicy sausage finishes off the meat trifecta. 'You have different flavors throughout each bite,' says Daniell. Adding some roughage to the pie is swamp cabbage--which is a type of hearts of palm--and tomato. 'It's a happy accident, it's about being creative,' says Daniell. Daniell estimates he has sold roughly 150 pies in the last two years. 'It's a happy accident,' says Daniell. 'It's about being creative' 'We're selling them left and right,' he says. Following the pie's success, Daniell says he like to offer a roadkill pizza featuring raccoon, armadillo and even possum meat. But, alas, 'I've yet to find a supplier,' he said. Daniell says its mostly tourists who want to try the pizza as a sort of 'When in Rome,' meal. The novelty comes at a price: a medium Everglades pie costs $45 owing to the python costing a whopping $66 per pound. Worth it? Daniell says the pies are way more popular than they ever expected even though a 14-inch pizza costs $45 dollars because of the $66 per pound python meat .","Evan's Neighborhood Pizza in Fort Myers, Florida tops its outlandish pizza with feral snakes caught in area swamp land .

"Richard McKee, 65, previously a judge at the highest asylum and immigration court has stepped down . A judge accused of going soft on foreign criminals has stepped down after admitting handing cash to an illegal immigrant who had lived in his home. Richard McKee, 65, was a senior judge at the country’s highest immigration and asylum court when he gave money to the woman, who is 26 years his junior, while she was living here illegally. The Nigerian woman, Fatima Umar, 39, was found to have overstayed her visa after she was arrested at Mr McKee’s house after a disagreement. She now faces being deported. Mr McKee, who has previously been accused of ruling far more often than other judges in favour of those seeking to avoid deportation, has been allowed to retire on a pension of around £50,000 a year without disciplinary action. Police had been called to Mr McKee’s £460,000 flat in Kilburn, North West London, in the afternoon of January 28 after a report of a break-in. Umar was arrested and charged with causing around £5,000 of criminal damage at the property and assaulting two police officers. She is now serving two eight-week prison sentences. When the judiciary was informed that Mr McKee had been providing financial support to an illegal immigrant he was allowed to retire without any penalty. It is thought that Mr McKee had allowed the ‘pretty’ younger woman to live at his property on and off for the last few years. He has refused to comment on the nature of their relationship. In 2011, Umar was sentenced to 14 weeks in jail after she assaulted the judge. Last year, Mr McKee was given a reprimand for falling ‘short of the standards expected’ of judges after he failed to inform the judiciary that police were investigating the use of his ‘premises’ for unlawful activities. One of Mr McKee’s neighbours last night said that Umar was attractive, but seemed like she had problems. The woman said: ‘She was a really nice lady, very friendly and polite and she would always ask how my children were. She was very skinny and pretty. ‘But she looked like she was off it most of the time. Whether it was drugs or alcohol, I don’t know, but she always looked pretty much out of it.’ Flat: Immigration judge Richard McKee has had to resign after it emerged that he shared his home, pictured, to an illegal immigrant from Nigeria . On the day she was arrested, neighbours said she was taken from the property kicking and screaming. Mr . McKee, a Cambridge graduate, worked for the Immigration Advisory . Service as a barrister in the 1990s, bringing appeals for immigrants and . asylum seekers, before he started adjudicating on cases in 2000. An . analysis of his judgments in 2012 found that in the 13 cases he heard in . the previous year, he ruled in favour of foreign criminals wanting to . avoid deportation on 11 occasions. At the same time another judge ruled against all nine criminals whose cases he heard. A . spokesman for the Judiciary said: ‘On 31 January 2014 it was brought to . the Chamber President’s attention that Upper Tribunal Judge McKee was . providing financial support to a person who was alleged to be an . immigration offender. ‘This was put to Mr McKee who then retired with . effect from 4 February.’ He said there would not be a review of Mr . McKee’s rulings as ‘this is a personal conduct matter’. Border control: Tory MP Dominic Raab said it 'beggared belief' that a judge paid to defend our borders had helped someone who had flouted them (file image) A . Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Fatima Umar is currently serving an . eight-week sentence after admitting one count of criminal damage and . three counts of assault at Hendon Magistrates’ Court on January 30 this . year.’ Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab criticised the decision to . allow Mr McKee to retire with a full pension. He said: ‘It beggars . belief that a judge tasked with defending our borders has been helping . someone who has flouted them, only to walk away with a full pension. Those who uphold the law should not be above the law.’ Yesterday, Mr McKee said: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t really say anything.’ Between June 2011 and May 2012, Mr McKee, 64, heard 13 cases involving criminals appealing against deportation, and in 11 of them he ruled in favour of the criminal bringing the appeal. Criminals he allowed to stay included Congolese national Wabi Longange, a failed asylum seeker found guilty of causing the death of a woman passenger by careless driving, and an Australian man, known only by the initials CB, who sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl he had fostered eight years previously. He also let Algerian illegal immigrant Amar Chennaoui, 43, stay after he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for unlawful wounding.","Senior Tribunal Judge Richard McKee, 65, shared his home with Nigerian .

"A creep with a fetish for Swiss cheese is terrorizing Philadelphia. Dubbed the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' the overweight man in his 40s has been spotted on multiple occasions in the Mayfair area approaching women while driving his car with his genitals exposed. According to his victims, he then dangles a large slice of Swiss cheese over his penis and offers to pay the women to perform sexual acts on him using the fromage. The Mayfair Town Watch warned local ladies of the lurking man on its Facebook page Saturday, and Philadelphia Police Department has confirmed the Special Victims Unit is investigating the curious case after several women filed reports describing a man with a 'major sexual cheese fetish.' Cheesy: The Mayfair Town Watch warned women of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' pictured, on its Facebook page earlier this year . 'I understand that people may think this is funny, but this is no laughing matter,' Milt Martelack, the town watch's senior adviser, told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'We've had a couple individuals reach out to us. We're taking this matter very seriously, and we're working vigorously with police to get this guy off the streets.' The 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' is heavyset and white and drives a silver or black sedan. The bizarre case shocked many residents but Gabby Chest, from nearby Bridesburg, recognized the fetish straight away and made her own report to police. In July 2012, when she was just 19, she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and within days had an inbox from a 'really strange guy' with a very specific request. 'He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,' Ms Chest told the Daily News. 'He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.' She added: 'There's no doubt it was him; it looked exactly like the picture on his profile. I was scared and shocked. I never thought the guys you see on those sites would be so close to me.' Swiss is best: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best,' 'Chris' wrote in an OKCupid message to a 19-year-old girl (stock photo) In the message, the man called . 'Chris' explained he developed the fetish after struggling to find women . and start relationships as a young man because he was overweight and . always judged on his looks. 'So I developed this fetish to help me deal with my sexual urges,' he wrote. 'I found that women tend to like dairy products, and settled on cheese to represent the girl. thus I started having sex with cheese.' Another woman, commenting on a Phillymag.com story, shared an OKCupid message her sister received from 'Chris' some four years ago, which was even more shocking. 'I love the way Swiss cheese feels against my penis. Either as slices of Swiss cheese being wrapped around my penis or a chunk of Swiss cheese being rubbed against my penis,' he wrote. 'I love even more when a woman uses the Swiss cheese to pleasure me. Or simply wraps Swiss cheese slices around my penis and allows me to hang out with her as I wear the cheese.' He explained that he prefers having sex with cheese over traditional sex and jokes 'I am lucky I never became a rapist,' suggesting this was an alternative to his fromage infatuation. Victim: A woman tweeted this picture of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' with the comment 'I met this dude a few weeks ago' #creep . Chis went on: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best. First and foremost, if ever a picture of cheese is used, most of the time they use a representation of Swiss cheese. But also because of it's eye patterns, texture, and the way it feels against my penis.' While he didn't offer Ms Chest cash in exchange for the sexual favor, so as not to suggest she was a prostitute, he did offer this young woman $50 if she'd pleasure him using his preferred method. He described in the expansive letter, however, that when he was younger he had far more stamina for cheese sex. 'I was able to wrap and wear a good 1 ½ pounds of Swiss cheese against my penis, and wear the Swiss cheese for hours at a time, before I would climax from just having the Swiss cheese on my penis,' Chris wrote. But in a strange twist, he insists he doesn't like Swiss cheese, only mozzarella, and would never consumer the cheese he has used on himself. 'One last note, I do not like cheese, except for mozzarella, and that is the one cheese I have never used on myself,' he explained. 'So no I do not eat the cheese after I am done using it for pleasure, it is discarded. I am always asked that question.'","The overweight man in his 40s has been spotted on multiple occasions in the Mayfair area approaching women while driving his car with his genitals exposed, holding a slice of cheese .

Taxi infographic . And with 10km separating the city’s airport from the centre, that equates to an overall cost of NZ$45 (£23) for a ride into town. Christchurch’s near neighbour Queenstown was barely any cheaper, coming second in the poll at an average rate of NZ$4.38 (£2.25) per kilometre, with the cost of an airport transfer spiralling to a total of NZ$35 (£18) for an 8km transfer from the airport. Two other New Zealand cities – the capital Wellington and the biggest metropolis Auckland – also made the top ten. And costs seem to be barely any less budget-busting on the other side of the Tasman Sea – where three Australian cities also make the top five for expensive airport cab journeys. Sydney is listed as the chief Australian offender, with an average rate per kilometre of NZ$4.23 (£2.17) (for the purposes of uniformity, the survey’s results were presented in New Zealand Dollars) – NZ$51 (£26) for the 12-kilometre journey to the centre. Where can I take you, gov? London is the most expensive city in Europe for an airport taxi transfer . West-coast metropolis Perth, and the capital of Victoria, Melbourne, are also named and shamed for the price of their airport taxis. British readers may be surprised to know that London only ‘achieved’ eighth place in the table, below the likes of Wellington and Perth – but also unsurprised to hear that it was listed as the most expensive city in Europe, and pricier than any city in the United States. The cost of an airport taxi in the British capital was calculated at NZ$3.67 per kilometre (£1.88), with the average ride into the centre listed as 29 kilometres and NZ$105 (£54). The UK also featured towards the top of the tree when the cost of airport taxi rides was compared on a country-by-country basis. The average cost of a British airport taxi ride was listed as NZ$3.48 per kilometre (£1.78) – a figure that was high enough to leave the UK at third place in the ‘most expensive’ table, behind New Zealand and Australia but ahead of the likes of Russia, Spain and Italy.","New infographic names and shames cities with most expensive airport cabs .

"West Ham chairman David Sullivan has admitted he regrets signing Andy Carroll for a club-record £15million. And the Hammers supremo has added to simmering tensions between the board and Sam Allardyce after contradicting his manager’s comments about Ravel Morrison. Carroll is set to miss the next four months after suffering torn ankle ligaments and has flown to Baltimore for surgery. It is a huge blow to Allardyce, who was desperate for his striker to stay injury-free next season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch crocked West Ham striker Andy Carroll in latest kit launch . Out: Andy Carroll is out for four months with torn ligaments in his left ankle . Mistake? David Sullivan regrets putting all of his 'eggs in one basket' with the signing of Carroll . Allardyce played a lead role in ensuring West Ham turned Carroll’s loan move from Liverpool during the 2012-13 season into a permanent deal but the striker made just 16 appearances for the Hammers last season after a series of fitness problems. Sullivan admits that in hindsight, spending big money on Carroll, 25, was not a wise move. ‘It was desperate last year, we probably made a mistake by putting all our eggs in one  basket (by signing Carroll),’ he told talkSPORT. ‘Had we known what we know now we wouldn’t have signed the player. But it’s easy to be wise after the event. ‘We were assured by our physio — who has since left the club —that the player would be available for the start of the season. ‘He wasn’t available until  January or February. A mistake was made and we were given the wrong information. ‘We based our decision and our purchase of the player on what the medical department told us. We’ve changed everything in that department as a result of that. On his day he is a devastating and fantastic player, we’ve just got to get him back to his best. SEPTEMBER 2012Misses a month after straining a hamstring against Fulham . DECEMBER 2012Twists his knee against Man Utd and is out for two months . MAY 2013Falls awkwardly and damages his heel against Reading and is out for seven months . ‘But at the same time we can’t start the season with the strikeforce we’ve got. I don’t think it’s good enough, there’s not enough height in it and if we get another injury, in terms of quantity, it’s insufficient, so we have to sign at least one more player.’ The club are now pressing ahead with plans to sign a new striker, with Monaco’s Lacina Traore among the names being considered. ‘We have to bring in another striker and we’re working on it now to buy one, or loan one, or both,’ Sullivan added. ‘You can never have enough strikers and really with Andy gone we haven’t got enough.’ Meanwhile, the Hammers board and Allardyce appear to be at odds over Ravel Morrison’s future. He is back at West Ham following his loan move to QPR last season. Allardyce, who was close to losing his job this summer, has said he is not part of his plans for next season, but Sullivan has contradicted his manager,  saying: ‘Sam has said Ravel is not part of his plans but we do — as a board — see him as part of our plans. ‘I think he said in a press  conference, if I read it correctly, he’s not part of his plans for this season. ‘I think he said that in New Zealand but we don’t agree with that. We would like to sit down and give him a longer contract.’ ‘We do like him, we do see him as part of the long-term future of the club but we have to agree it with the manager because there’s no point signing a player he’s not going to play.’ Hunt: Sullivan also revealed that West Ham will now be on the search for a striker .

"Actor Stephen Collins has asked a judge to eliminate any future spousal support payments over leaked audio in which the former 7th Heaven star purportedly acknowledged molesting underage girls. Collins' attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan filed a trial brief on Friday stating that his client has lost all future earning power due to the posting of the audio online last month. His estranged wife Faye Grant has denied that she leaked the recording made during a 2012 therapy session. Actor Stephen Collins has asked a judge to eliminate any future spousal support payments to estranged wife Faye Grant over leaked audio in which the former 7th Heaven star purportedly acknowledged molesting underage girls . A trial on how to divide the pair's assets is scheduled to begin on Wednesday. The recording cost the 67-year-old Collins a role in the upcoming film Ted 2 and knocked scheduled re-runs of 7th Heaven off two cable networks. Collins was due to be paid $75,000 for the Ted 2 role, according to the filing. ‘Spousal support should be zero, as a result of the unlawful recording that was disseminated to the media,’ Kaplan's brief states. Collins has not commented on the audio. Collins and Grant were married in 1985 and the actor filed for divorce in 2012. The leaked recording has cost Collins a role in the upcoming film Ted 2 and knocked scheduled re-runs of 7th Heaven off two cable networks . The actor had agreed to pay Grant $13,000 a month in spousal support, although the trial will focus on how to divide assets accumulated during the marriage. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, with appearances in movies such as All the President's Men, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and recurring roles on TV series after 7th Heaven concluded its 11-season run in 2007. Few Hollywood divorces in recent memory have been as ugly as the Collins case. The actor filed for divorce in 2012 and most of the issues in the case have been about money, although Grant included details about the molestation allegations in court filings last year. Grant has said she gave police the audio of a 2012 couple counseling session in which Collins admitted to molesting young girls. She said she did so only after he refused to seek appropriate treatment. But Grant has denied giving the recording to TMZ. California's ‘no fault’ divorce laws generally make the cause of a breakup irrelevant in court, and divorcing couples who don't have an agreement on how to split assets acquired during marriage are generally required to divide them evenly. Collins' divorce case will focus on how to divide property and earnings with Grant. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, including appearing in the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture . At issue in the trial is a pair of properties in the posh Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles and whether Grant should receive more than $13,000 a month in spousal support. Grant's attorneys wrote in court filings that Collins is expected to have more than $5 million in assets once the case is resolved. ‘I am seeking no more than that to which I am legally entitled under the laws of the State of California,’ Grant wrote in a recent statement. She added the audio has not been part of the divorce proceedings. Beyond the divorce case, the Collins audio has raised a number of ethical and legal issues about how it was recorded, and what it now means that the revelations apparently made in the privacy of a therapy session have been made public. ‘Clients knowing what they're saying in a therapeutic setting is confidential is hugely important,’ said Stephen Behnke, the director of the American Psychological Association Ethics Office. The ethical standard is for psychologists to obtain permission from patients before they record them, he said. There are legitimate reasons why a therapy session might be recorded, such as reminding a patient what is said during the treatment, Behnke said. Few Hollywood divorces in recent memory have been as ugly as the Collins' with estranged wife Faye Grant . He noted that while psychologists are bound to strict guidelines about disclosing details divulged in treatment sessions, other people in the room are not. ‘I think that there's an understanding that therapists control his or her office,’ said Benjamin Fenton, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in medical privacy cases. However, Fenton said it would be difficult to hold the therapist accountable for a recording made in secret. ‘It would be hard for him or her to be liable to the husband,’ Fenton said. Surreptitious recordings aren't uncommon in divorces and other situations where one person is trying to get the upper hand in a case, said Douglas Mirell, a Los Angeles-based media lawyer of the firm Harder Mirell & Abrams. ‘People do record each other with some alarming degree of frequency in hopes that they can use it for what some might characterize as extortionate purposes,’ Mirell said.","Actor wants to stop having to pay his wife $13,000 a month in spousal support .

"A patent has been approved that could see Google tracking, and making money from, the eye movements of its Google Glass owners. The Gaze Tracking System patent shows the device tracking where the wearer looks, how long they look at an item, and even how much their pupils dilate. Information about where the user is looking could then be sent to Google's servers where an image scanning algorithm would identify what they are looking at, create a log of everything they've viewed, and potentially use this information to serve adverts. Scroll down for video . A patent has been approved that could see Google tracking the eye movements of its Google Glass owners. It could potentially track how long a user looks at an item as well as pupil dilation. Images would then be sent to a server and kept in a viewing history before being used to show adverts on the device's screen, pictured . Consumers might need to buy bigger . and faster mobile price plans in order to feed data-hungry devices like . Google Glass, according to experts. American . technology guru Brian Fung predicts wearable devices like Google Glass . will be expensive for consumers as the hardware will probably not be . subsidised by wireless carriers and users will have to upgrade their . data plans. It is believed the device will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity. The patent reads: 'Eye tracking systems use cameras to measure eye movement/position to determine the point of gaze (i.e., where you are looking). 'Eye trackers have been used in human computer interaction systems, psychology, and other research field endeavors. 'There are a number of techniques to measure eye movement including video images from which eye position can be determined. 'To date, eye tracking systems have mostly been limited to research endeavors because of the intrusiveness, high cost, and reliability of these systems. 'A technique and system that can provide a reliable, low cost, and unobtrusive, eye tracking system could have a variety of useful everyday applications.' Tracking sensors would be attached to the small screen that sits above the wearer's right eye. The camera on the right arm of the device could be used to record the adverts and where the wearer gazes. Google could then potentially show adverts on the built-in screen. For example, if someone gazes at a sandwich being eaten by another person, Google could show adverts for nearby restaurants or cafes. Google could also measure how long . people gaze at traditional adverts such as billboards, magazines and . newspapers and send viewing figures to advertisers. It could also use this method to create a log of products that the wearer likes in order to make the on-screen adverts more personalised. Tracking sensors would be attached to the small screen that sits above the wearer's eye, on the left-hand side of this image, to measure position of the eye and pupil dilation. The camera on the right arm could then capture what the wearer is looking at . As explained in the patent: 'Under a pay per gaze . advertising scheme, advertisers are charged based upon whether a user . actually viewed their advertisement. 'Pay per gaze advertising need not . be limited to on-line advertisements, but rather can be extended to . conventional advertisement media including billboards, magazines, . newspapers, and other forms of conventional print media.' The patent does continue that the feature could be opted out of and that users would have control over what information is collected. It also details that any personal data would be removed before information is sent to advertisers. Commenting on the news, Nancy Owano from Phys.org said: 'Debate at this stage is premature. The patent, for one, filed in 2011, never mentions Google Glass, only with reference to a head-mounted gaze tracking device. 'Most important, this is a patent, not a product announcement. Patents at times do develop into real products and services but others do not. Time will tell if this patent evolves into advertising's new relationships with Google Glass.'","Approved patent could allow Google track where Google Glass users look .

"Attacked: Alan Greaves died after being attacked on his way to a Christmas Eve midnight mass - two men have appeared in court accused of his murder . The widow of murdered church organist Alan Greaves was in court today to see the two men accused of attacking him as he made his way to midnight mass on Christmas Eve. Ashley Foster, 21, and Jonathan Bowling, 22, were remanded in custody accused of murder when they appeared before magistrates in Sheffield. Mr Greaves, 68, a grandfather, died three days after he was attacked as he made his way to St Saviour's Church, near his home in the city's High Green, South Yorkshire. His widow Maureen attended the four minute long court hearing this morning and sat at the back. At a service after her husband's death, Mrs Greaves said she had wept over the 'evil that has been done'. As she left court with Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who is leading the murder inquiry, she said: 'Justice will be done.' Asked if her faith was helping her through this difficult time, she replied: 'Immensely. 'The support of the congregation and the police has been outstanding. 'I just want to pay tribute to all they've done, the sensitivity with which they've dealt with the case.'The defendants stood in the glass-fronted dock wearing identical navy blue T-shirts and jogging bottoms. Bowling, of Carwood Way, Pitmoor, Sheffield, has short, dark hair and a tattoo on his neck.Foster, of Wesley Road, High Green, has slightly longer hair. They stood with three security guards and spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth as well as to state their ages. Service: Mr Greaves was on his way to a mass at St Saviour's, near his home in High Green, South Yorkshire . There were no applications for bail and they were told they will appear again at Sheffield Crown Court on January 18. After the attack, Mr Greaves was taken to hospital with severe injuries to his head but did not survive. More than 50 police officers were drafted into the inquiry and detectives made a series of appeals for help from the community. Two other men were arrested in connection with Mr Greaves's murder and later bailed pending further inquiries. An inquest into Mr Greaves's death has been opened and adjourned by Sheffield Coroner Chris Dorries.

"A New Yorker who served 29 years behind bars for a murder he didn't commit walked free today after his conviction was thrown out. David McCallum, who has spent nearly two-thirds of his life in prison, sobbed into his hands as Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Matthew D'Emic vacated his conviction on Wednesday. McCallum, 45, said he was feeling mixed emotions because his fellow convict, Willie Stuckey, had passed away behind bars in 2001 before he could see their names cleared. It's 'a bittersweet moment, because I'm walking out alone,' he told reporters outside the court. Overwhelmed: David McCallum is comforted by Rosia Nealy, the mother of  fellow convict Willie Stuckey, after their convictions were thrown out in Brooklyn  on Wednesday. McCallum has been in prison for 29 years . Joy:  McCallum embraces his mother Ernestine McCallum after his exoneration on Wednesday afternoon . Support:  McCallum, who was locked up when he was 16, is surrounded and embraced by his  family . Thankful: Family members swarm around the freed man and hug him in an emotional display outside court . After wiping away his tears, McCallum walked out of court grinning with his arm around his mother, Ernestine McCallum. He was met with applause from supporters and hugs from his relatives. The mens' cause had been championed by ex-boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, who became an international symbol of injustice when he got his a triple murder conviction vacated. After their 1985 arrests, McCallum and Stuckey had admitted kidnapping and killing 20-year-old Nathan Blenner and taking a joyride in his car. They quickly recanted but were convicted of murder. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson had requested their convictions be thrown out because they hinged on untrue confessions made when the men were just teenagers. Their statements were also rife with inaccuracies and peppered with details seemingly supplied by police. The admissions 'were false in large part because these 16-year-olds were fed false facts,' Thompson said. No other evidence except the confessions tied the two to 1985 abduction and killing, he said. Theirs are the ninth and 10th decades-old convictions Thompson has disavowed since taking office this year, but the first in which he's cited a false confession as the main reason. Free man:  McCallum walks out of the Supreme Court building in Brooklyn after being exonerated when a judge determined that his conviction was based on a false confession when he was just 16 . Happy: He grins alongside his  family, but said he was sad that his co-defendant hadn't lived to join him . Relief: McCallum grins as he walks away from the Supreme Court a free man on Wednesday . The news stunned and dismayed Blenner's relatives. 'We were led to believe, for 29 years, that they're the killers. They confessed,' said his sister, Dr. Deborah Blenner. She added that the family found it troubling that a review by DA's staffers and an advisory panel of outside lawyers could upend a jury verdict that appeals courts upheld. The ailing Carter had been working on McCallum's bid for exoneration for a decade after getting a letter from him. He wrote a Daily News piece in February expressing his 'final wish' - a fresh look at McCallum's conviction. 'My aim in helping this fine man is to pay it forward, to give the help that I received as a wrongly convicted man to another who needs such help now,' wrote Carter, who died of prostate cancer two months later. McCallum and Stuckey were arrested after Blenner was found shot dead in a park, his wallet gone, in Brooklyn in October 1985. Back in Blenner's middle-class Queens neighborhood, witnesses told police they had seen two men push Blenner into his Buick Regal and drive away. The car was found, torched, a few days later in Brooklyn. Innocent: He speaks to reporters after a judge determined  his conviction was based on a false confession . New start: McCallum, second from left, stands with his immediate family outside Supreme Court . Emotional: He reacts as he sits in a car to leave the court and head back to his family's Brooklyn home . McCallum and Stuckey gave confessions naming the other as the gunman but soon professed their innocence. The teens were convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison after a trial that featured their confessions and a witness' testimony that Stuckey had sought to get rid of a gun with 'a body on it'; Thompson says the witness' credibility has proven questionable. They lost appeals, and Thompson's predecessor reviewed McCallum's and Stuckey's convictions but decided to stand by them last year. Thompson, whose office has been examining more than 100 mostly homicide cases from the 1980s and 1990s, said he was struck by inconsistencies and improbabilities in McCallum's and Stuckey's videotaped and written statements. Stuckey described commenting on a woman's car in Blenner's neighborhood shortly before the kidnapping, a remark she reported hearing as two men eyeballed her car. But the woman's description of the men didn't match Stuckey and McCallum, and prosecutors at the time took inconsistent positions, Thompson said: Although they embraced Stuckey's confession, they said the defendants weren't the men she saw. 'How can we say that Stuckey's confession was valid?' Thompson asked. Fight: Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, who  called for the case to be thrown out, points to a timeline of people exonerated in wrongful conviction cases during a press conference on Wednesday . Back up: Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, the boxer whose wrongful murder conviction became an international symbol of racial injustice, fought for McCallum's exoneration. He died aged 76 in April (2003 file photo) Stuckey also described three shots - something a witness had said to police. Authorities ultimately found evidence of only one shot, Thompson said. Police also didn't find the gun where Stuckey said he'd hidden it, under his mattress, and the statements described an hours-long drive by two teenagers whom no one had ever seen drive at all, the DA noted. The teens also said the shooting happened as night fell. Medical examiners determined Blenner died around 3.15 p.m. The detective who took the confessions has died. McCallum, the subject of a recent documentary film, 'David & Me,' has said he felt pressed to confess and implicate Stuckey after being told Stuckey had done the same to him. Recent DNA tests and fingerprint analyses from the stolen car matched other people, fueling questions about the case, Michelen said. No one else has been charged.","David McCallum, 45, sobbed as a  judge threw out his conviction Wednesday .

"It has become the Barclays Premier League fixture of the season... So Sportsmail invited JAMIE REDKNAPP, MARTIN KEOWN and GRAHAM POLL to discuss the big incidents from Manchester City v Chelsea. Head of Sport LEE CLAYTON listened in. KEOWN: Fernandinho’s absence is a big loss for City. I don’t fancy  Martin Demichelis in midfield at all. In fact, it makes me think I might put my boots back on! There’s a chance for Chelsea here. How bold will they be? REDKNAPP: There will be a lot of people tuning in, hoping for Jose to fail in this game. After his unfair criticism of West Ham, the rest of football was looking on, saying: ‘OK, let’s see what you’ve got then...’ My dad thinks Chelsea win this. Not many others do. POLL: You can see the tension in the game and what it means to both teams. Vincent Kompany just got away with a strong tackle from behind on Samuel Eto’o, then screamed at his partner Matija Nastasic. I don’t recall you falling out with any of your defensive partners, Martin. Not much, anyway. Scroll down for video . On skis: Sportsmail imagines Chelsea winger Eden Hazard on skis . Brilliant: The Belgian was unstoppable in a crucial 1-0 win for the Blues at the Etihad . What a strike: Branislav Ivanovic scored the only goal of the game with a great left-footed strike in the first half . Jubilant: Ivanovic and the impressive Nemanja Matic celebrate the goal . KEOWN: Only occasionally! That was Kompany, the captain, feeling a little hot under the collar. This has the feel of a huge game.  Ramires looks a threat on the break to me. City will have to deal with that. Remember that game in Barcelona when he was such a threat going forward? 15mins: No team have kept a clean sheet at City’s stadium since Birmingham in November 2010. Have Chelsea come to defend? ‘Are you West Ham in disguise?’ mock the City fans. REDKNAPP: I’m loving this start. It’s fast and furious but with quality. The passing is so crisp. Yaya Toure just set up a chance for David Silva, who should have scored. Sergio Aguero would have scored that. POLL: Interesting, that. Players are criticised for going down too easily, but Yaya stayed on his feet running into the box when there was close attention. He might have gone down. Beaten: Joe Hart was powerless to stop the powerful strike . Mixed emotions: Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini watch the action unfold . Ulucky: Matic sees a brilliant 30 yard shot rattle back off the crossbar . REDKNAPP: City work so hard without the ball. They hunt from the front. They press high and they have energy without the ball. You’d class David Silva as a luxury player, but he puts some miles in chasing the ball. They have a problem, though, because Demichelis is out of his depth in there. He’s not a midfielder. KEOWN: When Chelsea spring forward, City are missing the wheels of Fernandinho to cover and protect. They are exposed. Mourinho has set up a team to do a job at both ends of the pitch, but Eto’o doesn’t have the power he once had, which is a  weakness for Chelsea. Imagine Luis Suarez in this team. Mourinho has been ruthless in his selection, leaving out Oscar, but Willian is making up for it with his energy. Agonising: David Silva lays on the floor after narrowly missing a late chance . Struggles: Yaya Toure failed to have the same impact without Fernandinho next to him . REDKNAPP: We talk about financial fair play, but Fernandinho’s value is going up with every Chelsea attack. Chelsea have just had a four-v-two situation and they are beginning to get a grip on the game. They have not come to park the bus at all. They’ve come to win. It really does look as though Mourinho has got his team selection spot on. 32mins: Ivanovic 1-0. REDKNAPP: Fantastic technique from Eden Hazard to set up that chance . . . he is becoming as important to this team as Suarez is to Liverpool. Or Aguero is to City. And he’s only 22. KEOWN: That goal was about intent,  Jamie. Did you see there were five Chelsea players in attacking areas? The game plan is working perfectly. City need to get the ball into their front two more quickly. We haven’t seen enough of Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko so far. POLL: We haven’t seen much of any City players since the early exchanges. Nothing to do with officiating, but how poor are City? If Mike Dean was performing this badly, there would be outrage. Sliding in: Matija Nastasic makes a diving challenge on Ramires . Strong challenge: John Terry attempts to make a tackle on Zabaleta . Shoulder to Shoulder: Yaya Toure (left) attempts to wrest the ball from Willian . REDKNAPP: Dzeko got a little bang early on from John Terry and we haven’t seen much of him since. I can’t believe Chelsea are making Terry wait for a new contract, he’s getting better with age. He’s the best centre back in the country. Give him a new deal, before someone else does! The referee has given himself a problem, though. Four bookings and that Nemanja Matic yellow was so unnecessary. I don’t know why they do it. POLL: I disagree 100 per cent! Mike Dean has tried to be selective but that hasn’t worked. Now he’s trying to calm the game down with bookings. This is one of those refereeing performances that won’t be appreciated by fans — or former players, including you two — but Dean has tried to give individuals every chance to play football. He could have shown three early yellows but didn’t. When the tempo was increased he correctly cautioned four players and if that means a player is sent off for a second caution that is their  problem and not his. 45mins: Chelsea 1-0 up at the break. Ineffective: Alvaro Negredo (left) was surprisingly taken off for Stevan Jovetic . Fish out of water: Demichelis struggled in his holding midfield role . REDKNAPP: Demichelis is like a fish out of water. He’s out of his depth in there and the game is passing him by. KEOWN: Jose’s game plan has been executed brilliantly. They have so much pace in midfield. My only criticism of Chelsea is that they should have scored more. With Demichelis in there, it’s like City are playing one in midfield. Yaya is brilliant, but he’s in no hurry to rush back, so the defence is wide open to numbers advancing. The team who win the title will be the team with the best balance. 60mins: Chelsea hit the woodwork for a third time... Dominating: Chelsea hit the woodwork three times on their way to victory . Like a Rolls-Royce: January signing Nemanja Matic was brilliant in the centre of midfield . REDKNAPP: If this was a boxing match, it would have been stopped. POLL: David Luiz is lucky to escape a yellow card for that challenge on Stevan Jovetic. You can’t say Dean has been been card-happy, Jamie! He called it right when Nastasic fouled Oscar, too. There is no reference to ‘last defender’ in law and it must be a clear and obvious goal-scoring opportunity denied. That wasn’t. Dean has been excellent. REDKNAPP: No, Matic has been excellent! When I saw the teams, I was surprised to see him there, but he’s looked like a Rolls-Royce. Right call: Referee Mike Dean was correct not to send Nastasic off for his foul on Oscar as it wasn't a clear goalscoring opportunity . Twinkle toes: Manchester City struggled to handle Hazard's pace and directness . KEOWN: I can’t get carried away with Matic. He’s been very good, but Hazard is the one for me. If you put a pair of skis on Hazard, he’d win a gold at the Winter Olympics with his slalom-like dribbles. He’s my man of the match. His balance is beautiful and he’s cunning too. And Ramires is like a long-distance runner, the Mo Farah of the Chelsea team. Every Chelsea player has been on his ‘A’ game. That’s what Mourinho demands, that’s what he got. REDKNAPP: Chelsea have been magnificent. Jose has done a number on us all. That is what he does — he comes to life in these big games. Chelsea have kept clean sheets at United, Arsenal and City now, but this wasn’t just about defending, though Terry and Gary Cahill were superb. Let’s praise Mourinho for that. We don’t always give him credit, but this is a night when he deserves it. Job well done: Terry and Cahill celebrate at the final whistle . Dejected: Toure and Edin Dzeko leave the pitch off after a tough defeat . Final word: Jose Mourinho celebrates after a huge result in the title race .","Martin Keown: 'Every single Chelsea player has been on his ‘A’ game.

"White fat cells are responsible for flab, but brown fat converts energy into heat. To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers found a new signalling pathway called adenosine . Sit ups help tone your stomach, while squats strengthen your legs and bottom - but love handles are particularly difficult to shift. Now scientists believe they have discovered a way to ‘melt’ the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it ‘brown’. While white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab in general, brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat. To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers at the University of Bonn discovered a new signalling pathway. ‘Not all fat is equal,’ said Professor Alexander Pfeifer from the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology of the University Hospital Bonn. ‘If we are able to activate brown fat cells or to convert white fat cells into brown ones, it might be possible to simply melt excess fat away.’ By experimenting on mice, Professor Pfeifer discovered a new signalling pathway for a molecule called adenosine. Adenosine is known to activate brown fat cells, and is typically released during stress. The adenosine signal is transmitted  adenosine receptor A2A. ‘If adenosine binds to this receptor in brown fat cells, fat burning is significantly stimulated,’ claimed Dr. Thorsten Gnad from Professor Pfeifer's team. ‘The brown fat in mice behaves just as in humans,’ added Professor Pfeifer. In addition, the research team investigated the possibility that adenosine transforms white fat cells into brown fat cells - a process termed ‘browning’. White fat cells normally cannot be induced to burn excess fat by adenosine, because they lack the A2A receptor. Adenosine (molecule illustrated) is capable of activating brown fat cells and is typically released during stress. The adenosine signal is transmitted by the adenosine receptor A2A. By transferring the A2A receptor gene in white fat cells in mice, they began 'browning' and burning energy . For this reason, the team of scientists transferred the A2A receptor gene from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice. Consequently, the white fat cells with A2A receptors started 'browning' and burning energy. ‘Through the administration of adenosine-like substances, the mice actually lost weight,’ continued Professor Pfeifer. 'Our results demonstrate that adenosine-A2A signalling plays an unexpected physiological role in [brown fat] activation and protects mice from diet-induced obesity. Those findings reveal new possibilities for developing novel obesity therapies.' However, many questions still need to be investigated, continued the researchers, and clinical application is 'still far off'. The results are published in the journal Nature.","Scientists discovered a way to ‘melt’ excess white fat by turning it ‘brown’

"He is loved by adults and children alike. But an exhibition for popular plasticine model Gromit, the faithful sidekick to Wallace, was so overwhelmed with visitors it had to be closed to try and calm the queues. Organisers of the Greatest Dog Show on Earth initially closed the exhibition after thousands swarmed to see it. Fans: About 3,000 Gromit fans turned out to see the exhibition in Bristol forcing organisers to close the doors temporarily . It has now re-opened, but people will . have to wait up to six hours to gain entry to the event in Bristol after . hordes queued to see the show. With . an estimated 3,000 people waiting patiently outside those at the back . of the queue in Elmdale Road could see the front in Queen's Avenue. The queue snaked the whole length of Elmdale Road, into Tyndall's Park Road and along Whiteladies Road. Painted Gromit sculptures stand on display ahead of the opening of the Gromit Unleashed exhibition in Bristol . The show will see 80 giant Gromit sculptures brought together for 'The Greatest Dog Show on Earth' following the huge success of this summer's Gromit Unleashed arts trail . The 5ft high sculptures have been decorated by iconic designers including Sir Paul Smith, Gromit creator Nick Park, comedian Harry Hill, author and illustrator Sir Quentin Blake . Earlier organisers had closed the queue but have since allowed people to join. They had stopped people from joining the winding queue for health and safety reasons, the BBC reported. They tweeted: 'Exhibition queue is now . nearly six hours long. Anyone joining the queue from now we cannot . guarantee entry tonight.' Other designers include the man behind The Snowman, Raymond Briggs, and Axel Scheffler, who helped create children's favourite The Gruffalo . People will have to wait up to six hours to gain entry to the event in Bristol after hordes queued to see the show . The queue snaked the whole length of Elmdale Road, into Tyndall's Park Road and along Whiteladies Road . Once of those hoping to catch a glimpse of the exhibition in the former Habitat store on the Clifton Triangle was Karen King. Miss King, 32, from Gloucester, said: 'I really enjoyed the Gromit Unleashed trail and spent a day walking around Bristol seeing as many of the statues as I could, so I was looking forward to seeing the rest on display. 'By the time I joined the queue there were already thousands in front of me. 'I heard security say there were over 2,000 already waiting. 'The queue snaked around three streets. People were saying it was a two hour wait to get inside to see the Gromits. 'I waited for about an hour and hadn't moved that far, so decided to give up. 'I might try and go earlier tomorrow or maybe try and catch a glimpse after work on Monday.' The exhibition, which began on Wednesday, is open to the public until Monday. It features the 80 Gromit ceramic statues that made up a hugely popular arts trail around Bristol. They will be auctioned on October 3 to raise money for Bristol Children's Hospital.","Greatest Dog Show on Earth closed after thousands swarmed to see it .

"Drinking sugary sports drinks and following a high carbohydrate diet has left many elite athletes with dental health so bad it affects their performance, researchers have found. They say tooth decay affects upto 75% of elite athletes, and a third of medical problems at the London 2012 Games were dental. They also say that athletes were more likely to suffer eating disorders as they tried to control their weight. Don't drink it! Sugary drinks have become a key part of sports training - but have left many athletes with major dental problems, it has been revealed. Diet is not the only culprit, says the research. It found there is little in the way of education or encouragement to help athletes appreciate the importance of good dental health on their training and performance. Researchers looked at published evidence and data from the London 2012 Olympic Games. It found: . Tooth decay affected 15-75% of athletes; moderate to severe gum disease up to 15%; enamel erosion 36-85%; and pericoronitis/impacted molars 5-39%. Damage caused by trauma was reported by between 14-57% of athletes in high risk sports. Athletes from rich countries were no less likely to be affected than those from poor countries, the data showed. Dental health of athletes was on a par with that of non-athletes living in deprived communities. Unsurprisingly, up to two thirds of those who had sustained trauma to their teeth said that this had adversely affected them. But up to 40% said that their dental health 'bothered' them or affected their quality of life, while between one in 20 and one in five said that it had affected their performance. The Consensus Statement, which draws on a comprehensive review of the published evidence and a recent symposium on the lessons of the London 2012 Olympic Games, is intended as a call to action. The UK and North American authors, all experts in dental health and sport and exercise medicine, point out that dental consultations accounted for almost a third of all medical visits at London 2012, and that demand has continued to increase at subsequent major competitive events. Eating disorders are also likely to be a factor, particularly in sports, such as boxing, horse riding, gymnastics, and long distance running, where body weight, composition, and aesthetics are crucial. Experts say the problems must be addressed. 'Oral health could be an easy win for athletes, as the oral conditions that can affect performance are all easily preventable,' said Professor Ian Needleman of the UCL Eastman Dental Institute . 'Professional athletes and their teams spend a lot of time and money on ways to marginally improving performance, as this can make all the difference in elite sports. 'Simple strategies to prevent oral health problems can offer marginal performance gains that require little to no additional time or money. 'Things like better tooth brushing techniques and higher fluoride toothpastes could prevent the toothache and associated sleeping and training difficulties that can make the crucial difference between gold and silver.' There is a wealth of published evidence to show the impact of poor dental health on wellbeing, say the authors. 'With clear psychosocial impacts of oral health, it would be surprising if training and performance were not affected in those athletes with poor oral health,' they write. And this could be especially important in competition, where marginal gains...or losses can make all the difference, they say. The intense dietary and training pressures on athletes could put them at high risk of oral health problems for many reasons, the team say. Researchers looked at published evidence and data from the London 2012 Olympic Games. Researchers say water is a far better option for athletes . Saliva helps to protect teeth from decay and erosion, so dehydration and drying of the mouth could increase the risk of oral health problems. The amount of energy that athletes need for training often means they have high-carbohydrate diets and regularly use sugary, acidic energy drinks. These may contribute to decay and erosion in athletes' teeth. 'We do not want to demonise energy drinks and are not saying that athletes shouldn't be using them,' says Professor Needleman. 'However, people should be aware of the risks to oral health and can take simple measures to mitigate these. 'For example, water or hypotonic drinks are likely to be more suitable for simple hydration, and spit don't rinse after tooth brushing. 'For sports where athletes need a lot of energy drinks, high fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses should be seriously considered.'","Researchers found athletes suffered poor dental health which impacted performance .

"A father who posted a picture of him with his baby daughter and a chilling message on Facebook before shooting her in the head has died, it emerged today. Merrick McKoy, from Colorado, had broken into his ex-girlfriend's Westminster apartment on November 18 and, after she fled to raise the alarm, he killed their 19-month-old daughter Mia before turning the gun on himself. When police arrived, he was still alive and transported to a nearby hospital. The coroner said an autopsy will be conducted to determine McKoy's cause and manner of death. Chilling: Merrick McKoy posted this picture of him with Mia on Facebook before shooting her and turning the gun on himself . Citing the ongoing investigation, a coroner's official would not release the specific date McKoy died, ABC's The Denver Channel reports. Mia's mother, Kim Phanthavongsa, had a restraining order against McKoy who was described as being abusive and jealous. She told police that she woke on Monday 18th to find the 22-year-old standing over her with a gun. After a fight she managed to run to a neighbor's to call police. After she left the apartment, McKoy posted pictures of himself with Mia, who had just learned to walk, and a series of chilling messages on to his Facebook page. In one post he said: 'I told u I can’t live without u lol u thought I was joking now me n Mia out this b****.' The last post on his Facebook page, under the name Type R Merrick (f** Kim), read: 'Don’t judge me had no choice.' In a frantic 911 call, police were told McKoy was in the apartment with Mia and a gun. As police rushed to the apartment McKoy shot Mia in the head and turned the gun on himself.

"A flying car from Massachusetts-based firm Chas made its first public flight, soaring for 20 minutes in front of aviation enthusiasts in Wisconsin. The Transition vehicle is part-sedan, part-private jet and is due to go on sale as early as 2015. It was driven around the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show in July before transitioning into the jet and taking off on two 20-minute flight demonstrations. Scroll down for videos . The Transition made its first public flights, pictured, soaring for a total of 40 minutes over the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh aviation show in Wisconsin in July . The Transition's cockpit, pictured, has two seats and four wheels. It has wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car and can carry luggage. The vehicle runs on unleaded petrol . The Transition can reach speeds of around 70 miles . per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using a 23-gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 . gallons per hour in the air. On the ground, it gets 35 miles per gallon. It has rear-wheel drive when on the road. The Transition comes with two passenger airbags, and a full-vehicle parachute. Terrafugia's Transition has been in development for seven years and during flight testing last year, it successfully flew for eight minutes. The Terrafugia has two seats, four wheels and wings that fold up so it can be driven . like a car. It can carry two people, including the pilot, plus luggage and runs on unleaded petrol. In a statement, the company said: 'Terrafugia made a dream come true at this year's EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. 'The Transition performed its first public demonstrations for the aviation community during the show. 'Flown and driven by Phil Meteer, our Chief Test Pilot and Flight Test Coordinator, the Transition showed the crowd what it's capable of. 'The 20-minute demonstrations included flight manoeuvres over the show centre, converting from airplane to car, and driving along the flight line.' Transition is considered to be a light sports plane by the U.S Federal Aviation Administration, as well as being a road car. Owners will have to have pilot's licenses, and will need to . pass a test, plus complete 20 hours of flying time to be able to fly the car. Despite . the advances in technology the Transition demonstrates, critics have . said that it is still not the vision of flying cars seen in many sci-fi . films. To answer these critics, Terrafugia also released designs for a TF-X Model of its Transition range in May. The TF-X model will be small enough to fit in a garage and won't need a runway to take off. Whereas the Transition requires a . runway, the TF-X can take off from a vertical position because of . motorised rotors on the wings. These rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors. This shot was taken by a camera fixed to one of the Transition's wing during its public flight over Wisconsin. The 20-minute demonstrations included flight manoeuvres over the show centre, converting from airplane to car, and driving along the flight line . The Transition flying car, built by Terrafugia, making a banking turn in the sky above Massachusetts. The car flew for eight minutes at 1,400 feet during test flights last year, before completing the public flights in Wisconsin in July . This shot shows the Transition plane switching from drive mode to fly mode. The wings fold into the side of the car, built from a Sedan design. Drivers can only take off in the Transition from a runway. The Transition has a maximum flight speed of 115mph . Being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways, car parks and even when stuck in traffic. Although you will still need at least 100 feet in diameter in order to open the wings. According to Terrafugia, the vehicle will carry four people 'in car-like comfort'. It is expected to be able to fly, nonstop, for 500 miles. A Terrafugia test pilot fills up the Transition flying car with petrol. The Transition can hold 23 gallons of usable fuel and uses 5 gallons per hour during flight. On the ground, it gets 35 miles per gallon . When the TF-X - a new flying car design announced by Massachusetts-based firm Terrafugia - is in drive mode, the wings fold into the side of the car and the rotors, which make it possible to take off in the TF-X from standing still, also fold away and tuck into the chassis . When the wings are folded away, the TF-X will be small enough to fit in a single-car garage. Terrafugia announced plans for the TF-X today and is hoping it will be road-ready in 12 years . The TF-X model has not been tested yet, and prices haven't been announced. Terrafugia hopes to have working models of the TF-X available for sale within eight to 12 years. Like with the Transition, pilots will need 20 hours of flying and a pilot's licence to drive it, though. The flying car has always had a special place in the American imagination. Inventors have been trying to make them since the 1930s, according to Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst who owns R.W. Mann & Co. in Port Washington, New York. But Mann thinks Terrafugia has come closer than anyone to making the flying cars a reality. The government has already granted the company's request to use special tires and glass that are lighter than normal automotive ones, to make it easier for the vehicle to fly. When its not soaring in the air, the Transition's wings fold up, pictured, to make it a road-ready two-seat car . Special rules: The federal government has eased certain regulations to allow vehicles like the Transition to come closer to reality . The government has also temporarily exempted the Transition from the requirement to equip vehicles with electronic stability control, which would add about six pounds to the vehicle. Mann said Terrafugia was helped by the Federal Aviation Administration's decision five years ago to create a separate set of standards for light sport aircraft. The standards govern the size and speed of the plane and licensing requirements for pilots, which are less restrictive than requirements for pilots of larger planes. Inventors and engineers have been working on the flying car concept since the 1930s. Here, a 1947 Convair Model 118 ConvAirCar is seen in flight . Unholy alliance: The 1973 AVE Mizar attached a Cessna Skymaster airframe to a Ford Pinto. Its inventor was killed when the wings collapsed during a test flight . The 1930s Waterman Aerobile, pictured, was the first simple flying car to successfully be produced. A total of five were built and flown . Mann questions the size of the market for the Transition. The general aviation market has been in decline for two decades, he said, largely because of fuel costs and the high cost of liability for manufacturers. Also, fewer people are learning how to fly. 'This is not going to be an inexpensive aircraft to produce or market,' he said. 'It has some uniqueness, and will get some sales, but the question is, could it ever be a profitable enterprise?' Mann sees the western US as the most likely market, where people could fly instead of driving long distances. Terrafugia has been working on flying cars since 2006, and has already pushed back the launch once. Last summer the company said it would have to delay expected 2011 deliveries due to design challenges and problems with parts suppliers.","The £190,000 ($300,00) Transition is part-sedan, part-private jet .

"Exhausted and losing weight, Nicky Rigby put her symptoms down to the stress of giving birth just five months earlier. Tragically, she had no idea they were a sign of undiagnosed diabetes which cost the 26-year-old her life. Miss Rigby died after being found unconscious at home by her fiance. An inquest later heard the mother-of-one had suffered from Type 1 diabetes, which had led to her oesophagus gradually deteriorating. Scroll down for video . Nicky Rigby, 26, died just five months after giving birth to daughter Lily from diabetes she never knew she had . Her family later discovered she had many symptoms of undiagnosed type 1 diabetes - including tiredness and weight loss -  but had blamed them on the exhaustion of being a new mum and losing weight after childbirth . Her family discovered she had shown . all the symptoms of the condition, including tiredness and weight loss, . but had never been tested for it. Instead, she assumed they were the result of giving birth to daughter Lily. Her fiance said that when he took her to a doctor, she was simply prescribed iron tablets. The . coroner concluded that she died of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can . occur when people with diabetes do not get the insulin they need. Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This . happens when a severe lack of insulin means the body cannot use glucose . for energy, and the body starts to break down other body tissue as an . alternative energy source. Ketones . are the by-product of this process. Ketones are poisonous chemicals . which build up and, if left unchecked, and will cause the body to become . acidic – hence the name 'acidosis'. Left . untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis can cause potentially fatal . complications, such as severe dehydration, coma and swelling of the . brain. It is not clear how long she had suffered from the condition, or if it was triggered by  the pregnancy. Her . devastated fiance, Mark Wilson, is now sharing her story in an attempt . to raise awareness of diabetes among new mothers and convince them to . ask for tests if they have any symptoms. The 29-year-old, from the Wirral, said: ‘Nicky was a natural with Lily, cuddling and feeding her. ‘She loved being a mum, despite the sleepless nights leaving her feeling exhausted.’ Mr . Wilson said the tablets prescribed by the doctor did not help. ‘She . didn’t want anyone fussing over her,’ he added. ‘She just said that all . mums get tired like she was.’ But in July 2012, on Mr Wilson’s birthday, Miss Rigby began complaining of a stomach bug. The . following evening, she decided to have an early night while he went out . with friends. Mr Wilson said: ‘Nicky wasn’t feeling great and insisted I . go and enjoy myself. I kissed her goodbye then took Lily round to my . mum’s house so Nicky could have a rest.’ Hours later, he returned home and put his head around the bedroom door to see how his fiancee was doing. Her devastated fiancé Mark Wilson is now sharing her story in a bid to make other new mothers aware of the condition . 'Nicky was a natural with Lily, cuddling and feeding her,' said Mr Wilson (pictured left on holiday in 2009). 'She loved being a mum, despite the sleepless nights leaving her feeling exhausted' Concerned that Miss Rigby was looking pale and drawn in the months after Lily's birth, Mr Wilson took her to a doctor who prescribed iron tablets, which failed to help . He . was horrified by what  he saw. ‘I decided to switch on the light to see . if Nicky was OK, and then saw she was surrounded by black vomit,’ Mr . Wilson said. After dialling 999 he began CPR, but she failed to respond. He added: ‘Soon after, the paramedics arrived and I heard one of them say Nicky had passed away.’ Around . 300,000 people in the UK suffer from type 1 diabetes, which is distinct . from the much more common type 2 version of the disease. The main symptoms of diabetes that are common to type 1 and type 2 are: . Feeling . very thirsty, urinating frequently - particularly at night, feeling . very tired, weight loss and loss of muscle bulk (in type 1 diabetes) Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can develop quickly, over weeks or even days. Other symptoms include: . Itchiness around the vagina or penis, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection), . Blurred vision that is caused by the lens of your eye changing shape . Cramp, skin infections . Vomiting . or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a . dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for . treatment. The . inquest in Cheshire heard Miss Rigby’s death could have been prevented . with simple insulin injections to control her blood sugar. Mr . Wilson said: ‘All I could think was Nicky had wanted to be a mum so . much and now she wasn’t going to get to see our little girl grow up.’ Determined . that Lily will know her mother, he has put photos of her all over the . house and made a memory box that they can look through together. Inside is a gold heart necklace he gave Miss Rigby, as well as her diamond engagement ring. ‘I want Lily to look at the pictures of her mum and know she was a brilliant, fun person,’ he said. And he warned other women: ‘Please don’t battle on through exhaustion like my brave Nicky tried to do.’ Diabetic ketoacidosis is caused by consistently high blood glucose levels. It . occurs when a severe lack of insulin means the body  cannot use glucose . for energy, and starts to break down other tissue as an alternative . energy source. This process produces poisonous chemicals  called . ketones. Left untreated, . diabetic ketoacidosis can cause potentially fatal complications, such as . severe dehydration and swelling of the brain. Around 300,000 people in the UK have type 1 diabetes. The . main symptoms include feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently – . particularly at night – feeling very tired, weight loss and loss of muscle bulk. After his wife-to-be's death, Mr Wilson said: 'All I could think was Nicky had wanted to be a mum so much and now she wasn't going to get to see our little girl grow up' An inquest later heard Miss Rigby's death in July 2012 could have been prevented with simple insulin injections to control her blood sugar.

"China's first female Chairman Mao impersonator may be a hit with her fans but not with her husband who is refusing to have sex with her because he is put off by her likeness to the late communist leader. Chen Yan, 51, gave up her job as a shopkeeper and is now being paid a fortune by department stores and property developers to dress up as Mao and pose for pictures. But her whirlwind success had taken its toll on her marriage to the point her husband is now said to be 'disgusted' by her. Doppelganger: Former shopkeeper Chen Yan's likeness to Chairman Mao has made her a hit with fans but not with her husband .

She began her career as an impersonator when she appeared on television talent show . Spot the difference: Mrs Chen, left, and China's former Communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong, right . While she was not allowed to impersonate . Mao directly, she was permitted to impersonate Chinese actor Tang . Guoqiang, who is well known for playing historical figures in film and . on TV. Although she didn't win, she returned home to discover she had become something of a local celebrity. She decided to throw herself into a new career as an impersonator and set about studying Mao's mannerisms and habits even down to how he held his chopsticks. Effort: Mrs Chen's Mao make-up takes hour to apply at a cost of around £200 a time . Mrs Chen has her hair trimmed to mimic that of the late communist leader before having his trademark mole applied to her chin . Mrs Chen, who stands 5ft 1ins tall had a . pair of specially designed shoes made at a cost of £1,020 to increase . her height to 5ft 11ins.

"Police were forced to subdue a 100-strong angry mob which had gathered on a street where a one-month-old baby boy was allegedly raped and battered so badly his heart stopped. The infant remained in a serious condition today after allegedly suffering multiple horrific injuries in Gravesend, Kent, in one of Britain's worst cases of child abuse. The boy's injuries are reported to include a broken arm, broken collarbone, punctured lungs and severe bruising. He is also believed to have had his ribs fractured. Prayers: More candles and flowers are placed outside the house where the one-month-old baby boy was allegedly beaten and abused in Gravesend, Kent . Vigil: A well-wisher observes the tributes outside the semi-detached house in Gravesend, where the baby boy was allegedly abused . He also reportedly suffered sexual injury and internal wounds, suggesting rape. There has been no official confirmation of the extent of his alleged injuries. A group which initially gathered outside the £150,000 semi-detached house where the attack allegedly took place started a candlelit vigil, which soon led to damage as emotions ran high. A man aged 35 and a woman aged 33 were arrested and released on police bail. One of those involved in the vigil said they had gone to a house where they believed a man arrested in connection with the incident was staying with his family after he was released on police bail. Those taking part said the group marched round to the house before objects were thrown at the property and a car on the driveway damaged. A second successive candlelit vigil was held for the baby boy on Sunday night, as over 100 residents in Gravesend gathered outside the house where he was allegedly abused. Well-wishers released Chinese lanterns into the sky and held a minute's silence, following similar scenes the night before. The little boy is currently on life support in hospital after suffering a heart attack. He was last night said to be 'showing signs of improvement' after being transferred to King's College Hospital in south London, but is not being named. Lookout: Kent police were called to the scene of the vigil on Saturday night where a house was reportedly damaged . Community spirit: A vigil on Saturday outside the house had resulted in criminal damage, but a second coming together of the community passed off peacefully . Calm: Police urged locals not to engage in 'vigilante behaviour' before their vigils which took place outside the property on Saturday and Sunday night . One woman who took part in the vigil said: 'We lit candles and were saying prayers but then someone shouted 'let's go and find the b******s who did this. 'They then stormed round to this other house in a nearby street and started throwing things at the house and damaging a car parked in the driveway. 'The police have been there trying to bring it under control but people are very angry and feelings are running high. Kent Police today appealed for calm after the group of over 100 gathered for the vigil. Superintendent Stuart Kehily said it had been a 'highly-charged situation' and community tension was running high. He appealed for people not to seek retribution while police enquiries continued. He said: 'Kent Police takes all reports involving injuries to children extremely seriously, and specially trained officers are currently carrying out a number of enquires to establish the circumstances in this case. 'I can understand the anger incidents like this can cause in the community, but I strongly warn people against jumping to early conclusions and seeking some form of retribution. Suspects: The man and woman who were arrested over the alleged attack are both from Gravesend, Kent . 'Once again I would urge people to remain calm and to let my officers carry out their investigation.' Teddy bears and hundreds of candles - some still burning - have been left on the pavement outside the house where the baby was allegedly battered. One reads: 'Sending you all our love and hope you get better soon. Wishing for you a bright future filled with love and happy days xxxx'. Another simply says: 'Be strong little one xxxxx' A poem with the title 'The beautiful baby of Gravesend' has also been left on the pavement. The modest residential estate where the baby was allegedly abused lies around two miles outside the centre of Gravesend, Kent. Semi-detached . houses in the same area are typically worth around £150,000, while . certain crime figures for the local authority are above the national . average. Care: King's College Hospital where the baby was today in a 'serious but stable' condition . Violence and criminal damage figures are above the average for the country, according to Home Office crime statistics. Data from last year also ranked the part of Gravesham Borough Council where the child was found in the top two tiers on a nationwide deprivation scale. The area has some of the highest unemployment and lowest average wages of residents in any local authority, according to Atlas of Deprivation produced by the Office of National Statistics. Neighbours near to the house where the baby was found said a man and a woman lived in the semi-detached property with a new-born baby. They were described as  'normal, nice, polite' people, while another resident on the street said they heard a 'loud commotion' from the house on Thursday morning. A police patrol car has been parked outside the 1930s-built three-bedroom semi-detached house since the baby was taken to hospital on Thursday morning. The windows and doors of the property were boarded up in the early hours of Sunday morning after the vigil the previous night. Officers were last night also trying to stop Facebook vigilantes from causing civil unrest. Police have been carrying out a forensic examination of a house in Gravesend, Kent.

"A close friend of Nelson Mandela today claimed that the ailing former South African president was ‘totally conscious’ when he visited him in hospital this week. Denis Goldberg, a white anti-apartheid activist and stalwart of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), contradicted medical opinion presented in court this week, which states that Mandela has been in a ‘vegetative state’ for the last nine days and his family had discussed switching off his life support machine. The medical report into Mandela’s condition emerged during a court case this week between rival members of the Mandela family battling over where the Nobel Peace winner should be buried. Scroll down for video . Former South African president Nelson Mandela, pictured in hospital, is still in a 'critical condition' but is said to be 'conscious and responsive' Visitor: Nelson Mandela's close friend Denis Goldberg visited the former anti-apartheid leader at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital, pictured, on Monday . Denis Goldberg, pictured left outside the hospital, claimed Mandela was 'conscious and responsive' - contradicting claims made in court documents that he has been in a vegetative state for the last nine days . Goldberg, who was jailed for 22 years . during the infamous Rivonia trial of 1964 that saw Mandela imprisoned . for life, insisted that he had visited Mandela on Monday and he that ‘he . is clearly a very ill man, but he responds to voices and tries to . talk.’ He added: ‘He was dozing when I got . there. I spoke and told him who I was and he opened his eyes and looked . at me. I spoke to him for about ten minutes and he responded positively . to what I was saying. He was aware of who I was.' Goldberg, who served his sentence . in a white jail in Pretoria while Mandela was shipped to Robben Island, . said the 94-year-old ‘was incapacitated but he is totally conscious.’ He added: ‘He did not answer because he can’t . talk, with the pipe in his throat, but he was moving his jaw as if he . wanted to talk. I was absolutely amazed – after the stories I had . heard.’ With most South Africans resigned to . the fact that Mandela is unlikely to every recover, the conflicting . statements about his health have caused consternation, with one . commentator accusing the ANC government of misleading the public. Family: Mandela's daughters, Zazine Diamini and Swati Diamini visit the Mediclinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria today where their father is said to be in a stable condition . Update: Graca Machel spoke about her husband's condition at a fundraising drive for a children's hospital that will be named after the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader . United: 'Whatever is the outcome of his stay in . hospital, that will remain the second time where he offered his nation . an opportunity to be united under the banner of our flag, under the . banner of our constitution,' she said . Two years ago, Mandla exhumed the . bodies of three of Mandela's children from Qunu, where Mandela grew up, . and moved them the 20 km to Mvezo, where Mandla has built a visitor . centre and a memorial centre dedicated to his grandfather. Meanwhile Mac Maharaj, the spokesman for President Zuma, today questioned whether Mr Mandela’s condition had been exaggerated by lawyers acting for the family in the court case. David Smith, a lawyer for 15 of Mandela’s family, submitted papers to the Eastern Cape High Court revealing that doctors as long ago as last week had declared that he was in a vegetative state ‘the anticipation of his impending death is based on real and substantial grounds.’ Known as a Certificate of Urgency, the medical document was submitted to urge the court to deal swiftly with an unseemly dispute over the alleged theft and removal of Mandela’s three children from their graves by Mandla, his grandson. ‘Affidavits will be provided from his treating physicians that he is in a permanent vegetative state and is assisted in breathing by a life support machine,' it said. Having initially refused to comment on this explosive medical opinion, South African officials released a statement yesterday denying the report and insisting that the country’s first black president remains ‘critical but stable.’ The former wife of Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela Madikizela, arrives at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital where former South African President Nelson Mandela is being hospitalized . Visits: Mandela, who was hospitalized on June 8, . remains in critical but stable condition, according to a statement . today by President Jacob Zuma's office.  Zuma visited Mandela yesterday . 'This is the very family that has . taken their own father, their own grandfather, to court for his monies,' he said, referring to a long-running legal bid by Makaziwe to remove . the guardians of a Mandela charitable trust. ‘Madiba (Mandela’s clan name) remains in a critical but stable condition and that is based on Mr Zuma going to the hospital and being briefed by the doctors,’ the spokesman said. ‘Certainly in that statement, there is no suggestion that he is in a vegetative state.' Meanwhile, retired archbishop Desmond Tutu has . appealed to the family of Nelson Mandela to end a bitter feud over the . reburial of three of his children. 'Please, . please, please may we think not only of ourselves. It's almost like . spitting in Madiba's face,' Tutu said in a statement released by a . foundation he leads. 'Your . anguish, now, is the nation's anguish - and the world's. We want to . embrace you, to support you, to shine our love for Madiba through you. Please may we not besmirch his name.'

"It is a story of war, love and bravery and could grace the pages of any novel. But this tale of two war-weary servicemen from different armies battling to win over an attractive French postmistress - which includes an astonishing act of bravery - is completely true to life. The tale begins in the north-eastern French village of Hangest Sur Somme, close to the frontline of the First World War. Romantic: The story of how Victor Brookes met and married his wife Yvonne Brunel is worthy of any love story . The couple are pictured on honeymoon in Paris . It is here where a young British medic, Sergeant Victor Brookes,  met Yvonne Brunel in her post office. Her job involved regularly posting communiques to update locals about the war's progress and she would often meet servicemen passing through the village. Increasingly, the couple developed a close friendship. But it was not just Brookes who had his eye on the young postmistress. Carol White, from Michigan, who was serving in the US Army, was also smitten by Miss Brunel and they also formed a close bond. But, as reported by the Daily Telegraph,  June 30, 1918, was to become a defining moment in all of their young lives. Brookes was called to the village of Belloy-sur-Somme, which was just two miles from his sweetheart's village. An RAF corporal was trapped in a huge crater caused after a German aircraft dropped a bomb. Impressive: The Albert Medal from the First World War which belonged to Sergeant Victor Brookes is pictured. It will soon go on display in the Imperial War Museum in Manchester . Together: Despite the attentions of Carol White, from the U.S. Army, Miss Brunel decided to marry Mr Brookes. They are pictured at home near Manchester with their son Allan . Carbon monoxide gas had formed at the bottom of the pit, leaving the man extremely sick. Despite knowing that the crater was filled with poisonous fumes, two men attempted to get him out. But they were completely overcome and soon became ill. Despite seeing how the gas affected the pair, Brookes also volunteered to enter the pit. But, unsurprisingly,  he also succumbed to the fumes and had to be dragged free. The incident left the two men dead and Brooks was  hospitalised. The trio, along with Brigadier-General Alfred Burt , who also entered the crater, were later awarded the Albert Medal for bravery - one of the rarest honours which can be handed out. During his time in hospital, Mr Brookes  remained in contact with Miss Brunel. And it was during this time that, despite the affections of Mr White, the young postmistress fell for the stricken medic. The couple eventually married in Hangest in 1919 and enjoyed a honeymoon in Paris. After moving to Gorton in Greater Manchester, they went on to have two children, Allan and his sister, Yvette. Despite their rivalry over the same woman, Mr White and Mr Brookes remained on good terms. The American even sent the family parcels of clothing during the Second World War. The Albert Medal was passed on Allan when Mr Brookes died in 1974. He had planned to pass it on to his son Stephen, but three years ago he sadly died. Kind: Allan Brookes has donated the Albert Medal to the Imperial War Museum in Manchester . Allan, 89, has now given the medal to the Imperial War Museum in Manchester. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Allan said: 'Carol White and my father seem to have had the same object of affection and I do know that there was a tussle involving my mother, but it seems my father prevailed.' His sister Yvette Woodward, 82, added: 'Mother worked at the Post Office and would post communiques of the war. There was no television so she would get messages about what was happening and they used to post it outside.'","Sergeant Victor Brookes met Yvonne Brunel in Hangest Sur Somme .

"Manchester City will throw their hat into the ring for former England captain Steven Gerrard if he fails to sign a new contract at Liverpool. City boss Manuel Pellegrini, whose move for another thirty-something Frank Lampard has proved successful this season, believes Gerrard can carry on playing at the top level for at least another two years and said: ‘I don’t ever rate players on their age.’ Kop legend Gerrard, 34, revealed last week that with his current Anfield contract running out next summer he has no plans to retire so would be happy to play for someone else. Steven Gerrard is being targeted by Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini . The Reds captain was in action on Saturday as Liverpool went down 1-0 to Newcastle at St James' Park . Gerrard could follow team-mate Mario Balotelli who also played for Manchester City . The club have reacted quickly to give Gerrard private assurances they want him to stay and on Saturday manager Brendan Rodgers said: ‘I had a meeting with Steven’s representative explaining the situation. 'I very much want him to be a part of what we are doing here. He’s been a brilliant captain for me. I relayed that to the ownership.’ But until a contract is signed, clubs like City will watch with interest. Pellegrini needs bargains with City hamstrung by Financial Fair Play rules and the need to include more Englishmen in their Premier League squad. Pellegrini believes that the Liverpool captain can play on at the top for at least two more years . 36-year-old Frank Lampard has been a success on loan at Manchester City this season . The midfielder won the club player of the month award September after a series of excellent displays . City’s manager said: ‘I don’t ever rate players on their age.

'Like Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard is a top player and he can continue at a high level for a couple more years.’ Pellegrini could not challenge Manchester United for Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria this summer with City forced to name a reduced-sized squad for the Champions League as a punishment for breaching FFP.","Manchester City set to throw their hat in the ring for Steven Gerrard .

"Tunisian sunshine could soon be powering homes in the UK if an ambitious North African project gets the green light. The TuNur project aims to power up to 2.5 million UK homes by 2018 using solar energy captured in the vast Tunisian plains. Its investors have already spent £8 million ($12.9 million) on their project, which they claim will provide energy that is 20 per cent cheaper than other sources. Tunisian sunshine could soon be powering homes in the UK if an ambitious North African project gets the green light. The TuNur project (pictured) aims to power up to 2.5 million UK homes by 2018 using solar energy captured in the vast Tunisian plains . TuNur, a partnership between British renewables investor Low Carbon, developer Nur Energie, and Tunisian investors, has gathered three years of solar data from their site in Kebili Governorate. They are now seeking approval from the UK government, who has recently allowed non-UK developers of renewable energy projects to bid for contracts that guarantee subsidies. 'This is not a back-of-the-envelope fantasy,' Kevin Sara, chief executive of TuNur told Matt McGrath at BBC News. 'We are working with some of the largest engineering firms in the world. This is a serious project. Yes, it is risky like any big energy project is risky.' The TuNur project will work with concentrated solar power (CSP) technology which uses thousands of mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto a central point. Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine connected to an electrical power generator . The TuNur project will work with concentrated solar power (CSP) technology which uses thousands of mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto a central point. Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine connected to an electrical power generator. The plan involves building an undersea cable to Italy to connect to the European grid. But earlier this year, industry analysts warned that northern African states carried significant political risks. Vast solar farms are a blight on the countryside and will no longer be eligible for European subsidies, the Environment Secretary has declared. Liz Truss said carpeting acres of agricultural land with 'ugly' panels was preventing Britain leading the world in growing crops and raising livestock. Two years ago there were just 46 solar farms. There are now 250, with another 200 awaiting planning permission. Miss Truss has announced that from January subsidies worth £2 million ($3.23 million) a year from the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy will be axed. 'English farmland is some of the best in the world and I want to see it dedicated to growing quality food and crops', she said. 'I do not want to see its potential wasted and appearance blighted by solar farms. 'They are ugly, a blight on the countryside and are pushing production of meat and other traditional British produce overseas.' The policy does not affect subsidies for those who put solar panels on their roofs, or those built on the roofs of public buildings to generate their own energy. Landowners can still claim British subsidies from the Department of Energy and Climate Change for solar farms, but these were slashed this year. TuNur was an associate member of a separate solar project, Desertec which last week announced that it had all but folded. The project aimed to help to provide up to 15 per cent of Europe's power from solar and wind parks in North Africa and the Middle East by 2050. Desertec said that only three of its 19 existing shareholders had decided to stay on board: Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power, Germany's RWE and China's State Grid. They have decided to continue the project in an 'adapted format', Desertec said, adding that it would now function as a service company in the Middle East and North Africa. TuNur, a partnership between British renewables investor Low Carbon, developer Nur Energy, and Tunisian investors, has gathered three years of solar data from their site in Kebili Governorate. The plan involves building an undersea cable to Italy to connect to the European grid . 'Costs were very high and some companies said we're not that interested in the Middle East and North Africa,' Desertec Chief Executive Paul van Son told journalists, trying to explain why so many shareholders had left. Desertec's aim was to capitalise on the desert sun, which it estimated could provide more power in six hours than mankind could use in a year. Spread over a 6,500 square mile area more than half the size of Belgium, Desertec's projected delivery of more than 1 terawatt hours (TWh) would have been almost enough energy to power the whole of Germany for two years. Also, Europe has had its own solar power boom, raising questions about the need for imports. As a result, a number of major shareholders had already left the project in the past few years, including Siemens, Bosch, E.ON and Bilfinger. Kevin Sara, chief executive officer at Nur Energie: 'Recent news around Desertec (Dii) has raised some questions about the concept of North African solar. 'CSP is a proven technology and the Sahara is an area of optimum solar resource. Successful government programmes such as Masen in Morocco prove that developing solar in the Sahara is a cost effective source of renewable energy today. 'This coupled with the growing energy demand and need for low carbon and non-intermittent power in Europe makes North Africa an optimum region for large scale solar development.'","The TuNur project has already spent £8 million ($12.9 million) on its plans .

"A British sports car enthusiast is thought to have spent more than £6 million on a rare McLaren F1 in what could be a record price paid for a motor. The 240mph McLaren F1 is regarded as the Holy Grail of high-performance motoring and is worth at least six times as much as a typical Bugatti Veyron. It is the most desirable car of the past 40 years and, with just 64 ever built, it is also one of the hardest to buy. The Holy Grail: A 240mph McLaren F1 has been snapped up by a Brit for £6 million . The car is reputed to be the most desirable car of the past 40 years and, with just 64 ever built, it is also one of the hardest to buy . But now an anonymous Brit - a self-described 'car nut' - has joined the ranks after spending what is possibly a record-breaking estimated $10 million on the Woking-built motor. He joins an exclusive group of enthusiasts who own an F1 with Rowan Atkinson, Jay Leno and Ralph Lauren among a select few lucky enough to have a set of keys. George Harrison, the late Beatle, also owned an F1 with his bespoke car currently held in a family trust. This particular model, known as chassis 28, was originally given to U.S. racing driver Michael Andretti by McLaren. It is one of only two red McLaren F1s and it still has Andretti's signature on the back of the sun visor. The racing driver held onto it for a couple of years before selling it to a Japanese collector. It has since been owned by two California-based F1 fans. The amount spent is believed to be a record-breaking sum on the Woking-built motor . James Cottingham, vehicle acquisition consultant at DK, spent six months trying to source a car for his buyer . The Woking firm had hoped to build 300 F1s but there weren't enough wealthy fans at the time who were willing to spend more than half a million on a new car . After spending the past ten years on the West Coast of America, the car has now returned to British soil thanks to Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering. James Cottingham, vehicle acquisition consultant at DK, spent six months trying to source a car for his buyer. A car was found and an agreement was finalised last month with the red supercar now shipped over to the UK as the world's most expensive modern car. The price is thought to be around £6.2 million ($10m). In 2008, a McLaren F1 sold for a then world record £2.53 million with the latest sale representing an increase of more than 1,000 per cent over its original retail price . The value of F1s, unlike most modern cars, has continued to rise and over the past few years have gone through the roof . The McLaren F1 remains the world's fastest normally-aspirated car - a title it is unlikely to lose in the near future . It achieved this price, in part, thanks to its breathtaking performance which comes courtesy of a 6.1-litre BMW engine developing 627bhp. This gives the supercar, where the driver sits in the centre of three, a 0-62mph time of 3.2 seconds and a top speed of more than 240mph. Despite being 20 years old, the McLaren F1 remains the world's fastest normally-aspirated car - a title it is unlikely to lose in the near future. This latest model is the second McLaren F1 which Mr Cottingham has sold in the past year, an impressive feat in its own right. He said: 'I think this is one of the most important F1s because it was built for Michael Andretti, one of McLaren's race drivers and therefore seals the car's close links with the company's terrific motor racing heritage. 'F1s are without doubt one of the most difficult cars to sell or buy. You have a lot of ‘fantasy' cars for sale so getting a genuine customer and genuine vendor is very hard. The car is one of only two red McLaren F1s and it still has Andretti's signature on the back of the sun visor . 'Likewise for a buyer, finding a dealer who will be able to fulfil the task in hand is very hard indeed. 'It took six months to find a car and get the deal in place and the new owner did not see the car before the transaction took place. I flew to California with 24 hours' notice and the deal was completed just a few days later. 'The F1 is the most significant road car since the Ferrari 250 GTO. A lot of 250 GTO owners also own an F1. 'Last year a model sold at auction for $8.5 million and the market has moved on since then.' McLaren only built 64 road-going F1 cars and they were sold in the mid-90s for a then staggering £540,000. The Woking firm had hoped to build 300 F1s but there weren't enough wealthy fans at the time who were willing to spend more than half a million on a new car. But their values, unlike most modern cars, have continued to rise and over the past few years have gone through the roof. In 2008, a McLaren F1 sold for a then world record £2.53 million with the latest sale representing an increase of more than 1,000 per cent over its original retail price. Gold, which has been one of the best investments over the past 20 years, has increased by around 300 per cent during the same period.","The 240mph McLaren F1 is regarded as the Holy Grail of motoring .

"Oscar Pistorius walked free from court yesterday, with legal experts predicting he won’t spend a day behind bars. The sprinter was found guilty of culpable homicide in the shooting death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, but South African legal academics say a jail sentence is unlikely, and a Paralympic official confirmed he would be allowed to resume his lucrative career. Double-amputee Pistorius, 27, left the Pretoria High Court as a convicted killer – although crucially not a murderer – and must wait until October 13 for sentencing. Culpable homicide, or manslaughter as it is known in Britain, carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, but no minimum. Judge Thokozile Masipa is a keen advocate of leniency towards first- time offenders. Scroll down for video . Media scrum: Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius leaves Pretoria High Court yesterday after being found guilty of manslaughter . Criminal law expert Martin Hood said: ‘He is almost certainly, in my opinion, not going to jail.’ Legal academic Stephen Tuson added: ‘It could even be the imposition of a fine or community service, or house arrest.’ Miss Steenkamp’s mother, June, 67, said the family was ‘shocked and disappointed’ by the verdict. ‘It doesn’t add up,’ she said. ‘This verdict is not justice for Reeva. I just want the truth. I can’t believe that they believe it was an accident. ‘She died a horrible death. A horrible, painful, terrible death. They believe his story, and I don’t believe that story – that’s the difference.’ Her husband Barry, 71, who suffered a stroke after Reeva’s death, said: ‘I was terrified I wouldn’t make it.’ He added: ‘All we wanted was the truth. Now he must suffer the consequences. I don’t think he ever said sorry. You hold your child as a baby in your arms and you say, “I promise no harm will ever come to you”. And you feel guilty that you never kept your word.’ As Pistorius stood to hear the judge clear him of murdering Miss Steenkamp, 29, in February last year but find him guilty of manslaughter, he betrayed none of the emotion he had shown to the court during his six-month trial. The double-amputee, 27, left  court as a convicted killer – although crucially not a murderer – and must wait untl October 13 for sentencing . Loud sobs could be heard, however, only feet away as the dead model’s friend Gina Myers shook her head and wept. Barry Steenkamp slapped his leg and grimaced, occasionally snatching a glance at the man who had taken his daughter’s life. The Steenkamp family were desperately hoping their daughter’s killer would be jailed for the maximum life sentence. During the lengthy court case, they heard that she had written a hauntingly prophetic note a few weeks before she was killed. After Pistorius and Miss Steenkamp left a party on bad terms, she texted him to say: ‘I’m scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you will react to me.’ Such testy exchanges were common between the pair after they started dating in December 2012, less than three months before Miss Steenkamp’s violent death. Victim: Oscar Pistorius's girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The arguments mainly stemmed from the athlete’s insecurity and jealously, and his love of firearms. In truth, there are many dark secrets in the life of Oscar Pistorius, a man with a volcanic temper and a near-pathological obsession with weapons. There are many in South Africa – and throughout the world – who believe Pistorius still refuses to take responsibility for Miss Steenkamp’s violent death. And that yesterday’s verdict has allowed him to escape justice. After the verdicts, Arnold, the patriarch of the large Pistorius family, expressed his ‘deep gratitude’ to the judge for acquitting the sprinter of murder, adding, ‘there are no victors in this’. He spoke of the ‘big burden that is now off our shoulders’. Prosecutors expressed their disappointment at the court’s findings, but said they would wait until after the runner’s sentencing hearing before deciding whether to launch an appeal. In a failed application to have the athlete’s bail revoked, prosecutor Gerrie Nel – apparently stung by Judge Masipa’s comments that he failed to make the case for murder – presumed ‘a lengthy sentence’ for Pistorius, citing a recent nightclub scuffle, the fact that he was ‘a flight risk’ and the double amputee’s suicidal feelings as compelling reasons to remand him in custody. Even if he is jailed, Pistorius could still be in his early 30s when he is free to pick up the pieces of his once-glittering career. And the International Paralympic Committee yesterday indicated it was an achievable goal. In an interview that was seen by some as insensitive in both its timing and the language used, IPC spokesman Craig Spence described the convicted killer as ‘an inspiration to millions’ who would be free ‘to compete again in the future’. He told Radio 5 Live: ‘If he wishes to resume his athletics career, then we wouldn’t step in his way – we would allow him to compete again in the future.’ Whether Pistorius would be welcomed back by his fellow athletes is another question. Athletes and coaches who know him speak of a multi-millionaire whose life had been spiralling dangerously out of control for months before he killed Miss Steenkamp. ‘One minute he can be an angel, then dark the next,’ one athlete said. ‘He can get very bleak and angry. He’s used to getting what he wants. There are different Oscars – a kind, polite Oscar, and a really nasty one. There is no point trying to calm down the really nasty Oscar. That Oscar is, frankly, a lunatic.’ If Pistorius is jailed, he is expected to serve his sentence at the 107-year-old Kgosi Mumpuru Management Centre, formerly known as Pretoria central prison, an institution where gang violence is rife and prisoners spend 23 hours a day in horrendously overcrowded cells. His lawyers hope to persuade the prison management to allow Pistorius to use his prosthetic legs, but sources suggest they will be removed because they could be used as a weapon. Instead, he is likely to be offered a wheelchair and will be housed in a wing with other disabled prisoners. Yet among those who knew Pistorius, few extend him any sympathy. ‘I hope he gets the worst of the worst of what’s on offer in our prisons,’ one said yesterday. ‘He’s not a hero – he’s a violent killer and a coward. The world should curse every mention of his name.’","Sprinter found guilty of culpable homicide in Reeva Steenkamp shooting .

"Tragic: Kenneth Bellando, 28, was found dead in an apparent suicide on March 12 . An investment banker has been found dead in an apparent suicide in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Kenneth Bellando's death is the latest in a spate of suicides by finance professionals both around the globe and in New York. He was found dead in a neighboring backyard after jumping off his six-story building at around 10.20pm on Wednesday March 12. Police investigators told MailOnline that the case is still technically under investigation but there was no immediate suspicion of foul play and he was dead on arrival.

"Britain could face a return to Seventies-style power rationing to prevent blackouts. The disturbing news came amid warnings that the country may not be producing enough energy to keep the lights on by 2015. Offices and factories could be ‘bribed’ to close for up to four hours a day during the winter to prevent households losing power. Blackout: Britain could face a return to Seventies-stye power rationing, energy regulator Ofgem has warned . Energy regulator Ofgem said the . country faced an ‘unprecedented challenge’ as coal-fired plants are . closed by European Union diktats on the environment. In addition, nuclear power stations, . which produced 26 per cent of Britain’s electricity when Labour was . elected in 1997, now account for just 18 per cent. Ministers say the . previous government failed to protect our energy supply by commissioning . replacements for ageing reactors. Yesterday Danny Alexander, Chief . Secretary to the Treasury, promised £10billion for a new plant at . Hinkley Point in Somerset that could power five million homes. French . firm EDF had demanded government cash to put towards the £14billion . reactor. That funding was revealed as part of a . £100billion package to build new roads, railways, houses and schools, . in a bid to create jobs and stimulate the economy. Warnings: Pictured: Hinkley Point nuclear power station. Ofgem said the country may not produce enough energy to keep the lights on by 2015 . Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, has promised £10billion for a new plant at Hinkley Point . Ministers also . announced measures backing two controversial sources, wind farms and . shale gas. The plans were announced as Ofgem . warned that the gap between household demand for energy and the amount . our power stations can supply is dangerously small. The regulator warned . of ‘faster than anticipated tightening of electricity margins towards . the middle of this decade’. It forecast that with no major action  to . head off the crisis, the risk of blackouts would increase from the . current chance of one in 47 years to as little as one in four. To prevent an energy crisis, Ofgem yesterday announced new powers for . National Grid, which could come into effect before the end of this year. Under the most radical measure, businesses that sign up to a deal with . National Grid will be told to shut down between 4pm and 8pm on cold . evenings. National Grid, which has a budget of up to £800million to help . control demand, will compensate firms for the energy they do not use at . well-above the market rate of about £50 per Megawatt hour (MWh). Rewards would range from £500 to £15,000 per MWh. Officials claim the . closures would  not unduly inconvenience factories and firms, as they . could open on Saturday mornings to catch up on lost work. Unprecedented challenge: Coal-fired power stations are being closed because of EU diktats . Fears: The gap between the amount of electricity that the nation's power stations can supply and the demand from homes and businesses is getting dangerously low. Houses are pictured in Balham, south London . The new rules unveiled yesterday would also let National Grid resurrect mothballed power plants to boost supply. Andrew Wright, Ofgem’s chief executive, said: ‘Britain’s energy industry . is facing an unprecedented challenge to secure supplies... it is . prudent to consider giving National Grid additional tools now to protect . consumers as the margin between available supply and demand tightens in . the mid-decade.’ A Grid spokesman added: ‘We have been working with . the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and Ofgem to consider . what measures we can take... We are consulting on these two services . with the industry. ‘This does not mean that disruption is imminent or likely, but Ofgem, . DECC and ourselves believe it appropriate to consider what measures . could be taken in case margins deteriorate further.’ DECC said it supports the plans, but  questioned the figures behind Ofgem’s blackout warnings.

"Three members of an all-girl punk band standing trial for hooliganism apologised for causing any offence caused to churchgoers when they performed an anti-Vladimir Putin song in Russia's top Orthodox cathedral. The three young women said they had wanted to change Russia with their action but could have made an ""ethical"" mistake by offending worshippers. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29, and Maria Alekhina, 24, face up to seven years in jail if found guilty , but they maintain they are innocent to the charges. Scroll down for video . On trial: Three members of feminist punk group Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova , left, Yekaterina Samutsevich, right and Maria Aliokhina, centre, are on trial for putting on an anti-Putin performance in a Moscow cathedral . The trio waits in a defendant's cage awaiting the beginning of their trial session at the Khamovnichesky district court in Moscow earlier today . Initial hearings in the trial earlier . this month saw the court order the three members of punk rock group . Pussy Riot to stay in detention until January 2013, a move their . supporters condemned as travesty of justice. All three told the judge at the . Khamovnichesky court in Moscow they were innocent of their charges, in a . process that is growing into a landmark event in the struggle between . President Putin and Russia's emboldened opposition. In February, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, . Yekaterina Samutsevich and Maria Alekhina climbed into an area reserved . for priests in the Church of Christ the Saviour and performed a ""punk . prayer"" against Putin. The trio were all arrested in March and charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred of Orthodox believers. A further ten members of the band, . supporters and a few selected journalists were also present during the . demonstration but were never arrested. Riot Grrls: The three co-accused has apologised for offending visitors to the cathedral saying it was not meant to upset churchgoers and that their performance was only political . They have been held in detention ever . since and their case has been taken up by celebrities including pop star . Sting and US rockers the Red Hot Chili Peppers and become a new . rallying cause for the opposition against Putin. After the three girls, all dressed . casually, confidently declared their names, places of residence and . birthdates to the judge, their lawyer Violetta Volkova read out . handwritten statements in their names. 'The action was a desperate attempt . to change the political system. We had no intention of insulting people. We did not expect our punk appearance would cause offence,'mother-of-one Nadezhda Tolokonnikova said in a statement. 'The fact we do not accept guilt in . the charges does not mean we are not ready to admit our mistakes. If . someone was insulted then I am prepared to accept that we made an . ethical mistake,' her statement said. They said the motivation for their . action was a protest against the support in elections for Putin by . Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill which was against the principles of . Russia's secular constitution. A Pussy Riot supporter is shouting slogans outside the court ahead of the trial. Support for the women have been wide spread including U.S. rockers Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Stephen Fry . Dressed in plain clothes they all stood up to confirm their names and dates of birth to the judges. From left to right, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Aliokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich . The trio may be jailed for up to seven years which  would be devastating for Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, left, and Maria Alekhina, right, who both have young children . Samutsevich added: 'The main theme of all our texts was not (Orthodox Christianity) but illegitimacy of the elections"". 'The calls (by the Patriarch) to vote . for Putin and not go to the protest rallies are clear violations of the . principles of a non-religious state.' 'I don't understand the ideology of . the prosecution,'  Maria Alekhina , known as Masha, said after the . prosecution read through its statement. 'I don't understand why a . conclusion is made about our motives.' The father of Yekaterina Samutsevich, . Stanislav, said he had little hope of mercy for his daughter. ""Of course . they are going to be put in jail. It is a political trial."" In an interview with The Times . newspaper released by the government on Monday, Prime Minister Dmitry . Medvedev called for calm over the ongoing case, but acknowledged that it . had 'resonance' for the public.

"Ski slopes were open in France today for what is already being viewed as the most dismally cold summer in living memory. Despite it being the first weekend in June, the Pyrenees resort of Porte Puymorens was selling piste passes ‘like hot cakes’. ‘We have hundreds of people here enjoying the snow – it’s just like the middle of January,’ said a spokesman for the ski station, where mountains peaks rise to 2,827 m (9,275 ft). Summertime: Skiers in the resort of Porte Puymorens in the Pyrenees on a day out . Freezing weather: An icy spring means that the mountains of southern France are still covered in snow . Slopes were originally shut at the end of the official season in April, but because there was so much snow left an ‘exceptional opening between June 1st and June 2nd’  was announced. An icy Spring  means that the mountains between France and Spain are still covered in snow, with Eric Charre, the director of Porte Pymorens, saying people should ‘take advantage of all the snow that has not melted’. There were heavy falls across the Pyrenees throughout April and May, leading to regular avalanche alerts. Stations in fact had to shut down at one point during the winter because there was too much snow. Mr Charre said that slopes running between 1600m and 2500m in altitude ‘have as much snow as there was in winter’. He added: ‘From 2,100m upwards, everything is still pristine without any tracts of earth showing through at all. ‘The snow is on average 70cm to 80cm thick and in some places there are still drifts of up to five metres deep’. Temperatures at the ski station reached a maximum of 1°C this week, said Mr Charre. Fun on the slopes: Locals made the best of the coldest spring for 25 years by wrapping up warm and heading to the mountains . Some 600 skiers a day were allowed up in the resort’s cable cars this weekend, so as to avoid overcrowding. In total, four pistes will be opened on Saturday and Sunday, after which the snow was considered too slushy for skiing. It has been the coldest Spring in France for more than 25 years in some parts of France, meaning snow which should have melted weeks ago is still in place. While glacier skiing is common across France in May, June skiing is normally associated with countries like Sweden.","It has been the coldest Spring in France for more than 25 years .

"Attack: Energy Secretary Ed Davey accuses climate change sceptics of being 'blinkered' Emergy Secretary Ed Davey last night launched an attack on ‘dangerous and destructive’ climate change sceptics. The Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister accused ‘publicity-seeking’ critics of ‘selectively misreading’ the evidence so we can ‘all relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want without a care’. In a speech at London’s Institute of Physics, he said they had ignored a recent survey that suggests 97 per cent of experts agree on the human link to global warming. ‘Just three per cent question man’s contribution. Three per cent,’ he said. ‘Let me quantify that for you. If this was a general election vote, 97 per cent of the vote would generate 630 MPs, the three per cent just 20...’ He added: ‘To coin a phrase, “it’s the science, stupid”.’ Mr Davey, who said it was vital for Britain to lead the world by cutting its carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, also blamed the Press for giving an ‘uncritical’ platform to global warming naysayers. ‘This is not the serious science of challenging, checking and probing. This is destructive and loudly . clamouring scepticism born of vested interest, nimbyism, . publicity-seeking contraversialism or sheer blinkered, dogmatic, . political bloody-mindedness,’ he added. He said those questioning climate targets were ‘absolutely wrong and really quite dangerous’. ‘The science tells us we cannot afford to relax, let up or wait for a miracle,’ he added.

Target: Tory MP Tim Yeo MP, chairman of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee, wants to write tougher targets for 2030 into the Energy Bill . Environmental . policy is a major faultline between the coalition parties, with the . Conservatives against onshore wind turbines and green regulations that . they claim will harm businesses. Former . Conservative minister David Davis said the claim that scientists are . united in the belief that global warming is driven by human activity . ‘simply does not stack up’. ‘The . last thing Britain needs at a time of rising energy bills is an Energy . Minister who uses dodgy statistics and alarmist rhetoric to justify even . more massively flawed green energy policies,’ he added . An energy firm involved in controversial shale gas fracking is sitting on up to 19 times more gas than previously thought.

Andrew Austin, iGas’s chief executive, said only 15 per cent of the gas might be recoverable, but could make the UK less dependent on gas imports for up to 15 years. It plans further research into prospective shale gas resources in the East Midlands and the Weald Basin in the south of England.","Lib Dem minister launches extraordinary attack on his opponents .

"More than 120 Britons were rescued last night after being stranded on a cruise ship in Austria for almost a week because of torrential rain. The Dutch-registered Filia Rheni had just left Vienna last Saturday when shipping on the Danube was halted because the river was so swollen.

'I was personally not worried, although I could see that some people were concerned. I was mainly frustrated that we did not get to do our cruise.' The Danube has reached heights not . seen for 500 years and jetties along the river have been swamped and . dozens of ships abandoned. The Dutch-registered Filia Rheni cruiser was the only one that still had passengers onboard. Prior to the rescue the ship was tied to a pontoon until the waters receded. Skipper .

At least 16 people have died in the flooding of the Danube and Elbe rivers in central Europe this week and at least four others are missing. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in the region, including over 700 in the eastern German city of Dresden, where the Elbe crested Thursday at 21 feet above normal levels. The Danube is normally around 400 yards wide as it passes the city's imposing Hungarian parliament building.

"There was a match during Atletico Madrid’s La Liga-winning campaign last season against Real Madrid when Diego Costa twice spat in his gloved hand then threw the phlegm at Sergio Ramos. The defender was, understandably, incensed by the revolting act, but it was done so discreetly the referee was unable to punish the striker. During the game he lightly rocks his head — just short of a head-butt — into Ramos, slaps him, and verbally winds up Pepe several times. At the end of the game, they hug and make up. Diego Costa (right) had a reputation for coming to blows with opponents before he joined Chelsea . Despite Costa's controversial characteristics, his scoring ability also followed from Atletico Madrid to Chelsea . Costa (left) joined Chelsea from the Spanish champions Atletico last summer . Filipe Luis (right), a defender, followed Costa to London from Spain last summer . Costa is football’s ultimate Machiavellian character, one who would give Shakespeare’s Iago a run for his money when it comes to the subtle dark arts of manipulation. ‘Diego has been playing like this since he started playing football,’ explains Filipe Luis, who spent four years as his team-mate at Atletico Madrid before the pair moved over to Stamford Bridge within a day of each other last summer. ‘He never changes.’ Tottenham’s defenders beware; they are in for a bumpy ride when they face Chelsea at Wembley this afternoon. A month into the season Costa escaped a ban despite putting his hands around Pablo Zabaleta’s neck. Both players were booked but the Manchester City defender was sent off for a second yellow card. The striker was not, however, so fortunate in the second leg of Chelsea’s League Cup semi-final win against Liverpool, when he was retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on Emre Can. He also caught Martin Skrtel with his studs. But Luis has a different interpretation than most of Costa’s actions. ‘He is not violent or aggressive, he is intense,’ he says. Costa (right) escaped punishment for landing his studs on the leg of Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel . Costa (centre) confronts Burnley defender Jason Shackell (left) during Chelsea's draw with Burnley . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been incensed with the treatment of Costa this season . ‘He tries to win all the balls in any way possible. That’s the kind of players we need and we have that in the team. I don’t think reputation means anything.’ Alongside Costa’s goals — he scored a phenomenal 35 in 46 games last season — this mentality is what persuaded Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to lighten his wallet by £32million in July. But bans are costly. Missing three matches has left Costa stilted and without a goal in the two games he has played since his return. Luis, however, is convinced his team-mate is now back to match fitness, making him ready to inflict his might on Tottenham. Costa has been playing like this, as Luis says, since he gained his footballing education on the streets of Lagarto in one of Brazil’s most impoverished regions. A boy playing among men, he learned to use his physicality to score goals. The experience grew his fiercely competitive and combative nature. ‘He always wants to win, in training, in video games, in cards, everywhere he plays he wants to win,’ Luis adds. ‘Everybody here at Chelsea has this ambition. To get to a big club like Chelsea you have to have this ambition inside you, so Diego is not an exception. Costa (right) pictured in action in Chelsea's 5-3 defeat to Tottenahm on New Year's Day . Costa will hope to be celebrating his first trophy on English shores with the Captial One Cup final at Wembley . ‘Every minute he plays he gives everything. Everybody knows him, he always tries to win, he tries to help the team. He plays for the team, he doesn’t play for himself. That’s the kind of player that helps Chelsea to be champions. ‘Of course he is going to be in the best way for the game because he is a striker, he is joint top-scorer in the league right now (on 17 with Sergio Aguero), he wants cups, he is ambitious, so that’s why I am so proud to play with him.’ Jose Mourinho seeks winners to bring home trophies. Today could bring the first of many in his second spell in charge. Costa is prepared to win it. At all costs.","Diego Costa has been controversial and brilliant in his time at Chelsea .

'Tom Howard had a fantastic match but we need to forget about this match and focus on Argentina. 'There shouldn't be any more worries from the media about us not playing football.'
