"A boy who was just 15 when he fatally shot his 12-year-old half-sister has been sentenced to 30 years in prison - after she identified him as the killer before she died. Levi Elliott, now 17, was handed down 20 years for second-degree murder, five years for armed criminal action and five years for tampering with a motor vehicle at a Polk County, Missouri court on Wednesday. His father had pleaded with the judge to give Elliott the maximum penalty, saying he feared the teenager was capable of murdering again. He must serve 20 years before he is eligible for parole. It comes three months after the teen was convicted of shooting his sister Sierra in the head while she watched TV on March 24, 2012 at their Bolivar home. Their parents - his biological father and stepmother - had left them alone at the house together for 30 minutes. Locked up: Levi Elliott can be seen in court during his sentencing hearing on Wednesday. The 17-year-old was sentenced to 30 years in prison for shooting dead his sister when he was just 15 . When the couple arrived home, they found Elliott and his father's pickup truck gone and Sierra barely alive. She was unable to talk but raised her hand to indicate 'yes' when her mother asked if Elliott had shot her, the Springfield News-Leader reported. She died the following day. After the shooting, he drove to a nearby payphone, where he called his biological mother and stepfather and told them an intruder had burst into the home and shot dead Sierra. Operating the truck without consent or a proper license, Elliott drove to his mother's home in Kansas City and turned himself into authorities a day after the shooting. Although there was no specific forensic evidence pointing to Elliott as the killer, there were inconsistencies in his story and no one else had the motive to shoot her, prosecutors told the court. One of Elliott's classmates testified that they had heard him say he hated his sister and wouldn't care if she died, prosecutor Kenneth Ashlock, said, the Bolivar Herald-Free Press reported. Killer: Levi Elliott is pictured left in his mug shot after his arrest. Prosecutors said he shot his 12-year-old half-sister Sierra, right, in the head while she watched television at their Missouri home in March 2012 . Murdered: Sierra, pictured, was unable to speak when her parents arrived home but indicated 'yes' with her hand when her mother asked if Levi had shot her. She died from her injuries the following day . In custody: Footage shows Elliott after his arrest, when he was just 15. After the killing, he fled the scene in his dad's pickup truck and went to his mother's home before turning himself into police . Prosecutors told the jury that after 'ambushing' his sister in her parents' bedroom, Elliott 'told a story so unbelievable that it contradicts reason and all the evidence in the case'. When Elliott spoke to his mother on the phone, he said he had been at home with Sierra when he heard a gunshot and rushed to the room where he saw a stranger with a rifle going through the family's drawers. He claimed the gunman then chased him out of the house before climbing in a Jeep and following him as he drove away. 'His story is entirely improbable if not impossible,' Assistant Attorney General Josh Harrel said. Harrel said that questions remained over how the teenager had been able to put on his shoes before running away and why the front door was locked when the parents arrived back home. The boy's father had also testified that his pickup was hard to start and took time to warm up - even though the teenager claimed it was his getaway vehicle. Plea: His father, James Elliott, pictured, pleaded with the judge to sentence his son to the maximum sentence possible, saying he believed he could murder again. James Elliott was also the father of Sierra . Heartbroken: Levi Elliott's mother, Joy Adams, said she believed her son was innocent and had been abused by his father - but an investigation found the claims to be unsubstantiated . 'His story is a fabrication not supported by evidence,' Harrel said, the BH-FP reported. 'He could not tell his mom and stepdad the truth, which was that he shot Sierra.' But the defense argued that it could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Elliott was guilty, as no blood was found on his clothes or on any of the guns taken from the home. At the hearing, the jury had not been allowed to hear Peggy Elliott's claims that her daughter had indicated that Levi Elliott had pulled the trigger. A judge ruled that no evidence showed that Sierra knew she was dying when she raised her hand so did not qualify as a dying declaration. It was ruled inadmissible at trial, the BH-FP reported. Even though Elliott was 15 at the time of the killing, he was brought to trial as an adult. During the sentencing hearing, Elliott's father, who was also Sierra's father, had begged for his son to get the maximum possible punishment of 30 years, KY3 reported. 'I now know what Levi is capable of: murder - and I believe he would do it again,' said James Elliott. Heading to prison: Elliott, who maintains he is innocent, will not be eligible for parole for 20 years . But his mother, Joy Adams, insisted that her son was innocent, telling the news channel: 'Five minutes in prison would have been too much for my son.' After he was found guilty in October, she became ill and was rushed from the courthouse in an ambulance. Elliott's sister, Ashley Elliott, told the judge should be lenient on her brother because he was mistreated by their father. 'He was paddled with a board on his backside, on the backs of his legs, and a couple times he would take the board and hit him across the face with it,' she said. But Children's Services did not find evidence of abuse at the house, the judge said. Elliott maintains his innocence.","Levi Elliott, now 17, was sentenced to 30 years for the murder of his sister Sierra at their Bolivar, Missouri home in March 2012 .

"Thirteen former United Airline employees filed a complaint against the company this week for firing them last year when they refused to fly on a plane that had a 'Bye Bye' message written on it along with a 'devilish' face. According to the complaint filed Tuesday, the words 'BYE BYE' were written in oil residue on the plane's tail. Along with the words were two faces, one face drawn with a smile and another with, what the complaint states is, a 'frowning or devilish' expression. Message: Thirteen former United Airline employees filed a complaint against the company this week for firing them last year when they refused to fly on a plane that had a 'Bye Bye' message written on it along with a 'devilish' face . The employees refused to fly on the July 14 Hong Kong-bound flight despite reassurances from the pilot, mechanics, and security that the Boeing 747-400 plane at San Francisco International Airport was safe to fly, according to The New York Daily News. The flight attendants are seeking reinstatement along with backpay and compensatory damages, according to the Tribune, but an airline spokeswoman said the company plans to 'vigorously' defend its decision. The spokeswoman, from the Chicago-based United Airlines, told Reuters that the airlines teams investigated the issue and found there was no 'credible security threat.' 'Vigorously:' The flight attendants are seeking reinstatement along with backpay and compensatory damages, but an airline spokeswoman said the company plans to 'vigorously' defend its decision . In the complaint, the employees said the airline refused to empty the plane of its more than 300 passengers and perform a security inspection. The employees, all with 18 or more years of experience, refused to work believing the lives of the passengers and crew were in danger, Reuters reports. The flight was delayed and soon cancelled. The employees were fired for insubordination, according to the complaint. The workers said in the complaint that they had been on alert following an incident one week earlier where federal authorities announced an enhanced security screening due to the threat of explosive devices onboard. Warning: The former-employees said they were seeking additional security measure following a possible phone-and-laptop bomb warning a week earlier from the Transportation Security Administration . The former-employees said they were seeking additional security measure following a possible phone-and-laptop bomb warning a week earlier from the Transportation Security Administration. The flight attendants hold that their termination was a violation of a federal whistleblower law that prohibits the airline from retaliating for reporting air safety issues, the Tribune reports. 'These flight attendants refused to let an airline bully them into flying because of what they believed, correctly, was a security threat,' their attorney, David Marshall, said in an interview, according to Reuters.","Thirteen former United Airline employees filed complaint  this week .

"A man who endured a painful erection for several weeks after a suffering a rare side effect to a sleeping tablet says his penis has been left permanently damaged. Edward Stalling was hospitalised for 10 days as doctors treated his prolonged erection. He developed fibrosis – where the arteries and muscles in the penis becoming hardened with fibrous tissue – as a result of the continued erection. He claims this has left him impotent and with difficulty urinating - and is suing the hospital for not making the side effects of the sleeping tablets clear to him. Scroll down for video. A man suffered an erection for weeks after suffering a rare side effect to the sleeping tablets says he has been left impotent and with difficulty urinating (file pic) Mr Stalling suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and takes sleeping tablets from time to time to deal with the insomnia, CBS46 news reports. In October, doctors at Alanta VA Medical centre prescribed the drug Trazodone to help him sleep. While it helped temporarily, by December he was having trouble sleeping and so took the drug once again. 'I took it that night and the next day I woke up with that problem,' Mr Stalling told CBS46 news. When the problem didn't subside, Mr Stalling drove himself to the hospital. But when he arrived, he claims doctors 'made a spectacle of his condition'. 'One had mentioned that I should line up all the women,' Mr Stalling said. He added: 'I haven't had that many people who'd seen it in my whole life until I went to that hospital.' He said that multiple doctors and nurses came to his bed to look at him. Trazodone is an antidepressant which is also commonly prescribed for insomnia. One of its rare side effects is a continued painful erection, which occurs in one out of every 10,000 to 20,000 users. Priapism usually affects men but in rare cases, can affect women too. The condition is where a penis or clitoris becomes engorged with blood, causing a painful, long-lasting erection. It is caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis. Also, a number of medications can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of the nerves that help trigger an erection by widening the arteries in the penis. The nerves essentially ‘forget’ to narrow the arteries after the feelings of sexual arousal have passed, leading to priapism. Those that have been linked to priapism include anti-depressants, erectile dysfunction medication and some recreational drugs. Mr Stalling alleges after being hospitalised he was left with a 'non-functioning sex organ and trouble urinating'. ‘I can’t look too far ahead because the future don’t seem that bright,' he said. He plans on suing the hospital for damages after developing fibrosis in his penis, according to his lawyer, Jonathan Johnson. Priapism, the medical name for a continued erection, is known to cause fibrosis. This is when hard, fibrous tissue forms in the penis - in a process similar to scarring. Scar tissue forms on the lining of the erectile tissue, where  blood is held in the penis when a man has an erection. The area becomes hard and the scar tissue prevents normal stretching, affecting the size and shape of the erect penis. If the muscle and the arteries of the penis become hardened with fibrous tissue, it can lead to erectile dysfunction. A spokesperson for the The Atlanta VA Medical Center said: '[We] place the highest priority on delivering quality care while respecting the privacy of veterans. 'Our focus has always been to deliver this care in a professional, compassionate and safe environment. 'When issues occur in our system we conduct reviews to identify, correct and work to prevent additional risk. 'It would be inappropriate to comment on this case without consent from the veteran.'

"The Japan Meteorological Association (JMA) has become the latest organisation to claim that 2014 was the hottest on record. They say it was 0.27°C warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C warmer than the 20th century average - without the help of an El Niño weather event. And according to their data, ten of the hottest years on record have come since 1998. The Japan Meteorological Association has released their data for 2014 (shown). They say it is the hottest year on record - 0.27°C above the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C above the 20th Century average. The findings are especially notable because there was no El Niño last year . The JMA joins Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in the US, and the UK Met Office, as one of four major global temperature 'keepers' to reveal 2014 was the hottest ever. All four make their readings separately to one another - and they have all individually come to the same conclusion that last year was the hottest since records began in the late 19th century. Experts say the rate at which it is warming is alarmingly quick, and heavily suggests the emission of CO2 by humans is causing manmade global warming. 1. 2014 (+0.27°C) 2. 1998 (+0.22°C) 3 (tie). 2013 , 2010 (+0.20°C) 5. 2005 (+0.17°C) According to the JMA, the average temperature last year was 0.27°C warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010, and 0.63°C warmer than the 20th Century average. And it is by far the hottest year in 120 years of keeping records. The findings also reveal there has been no warming slowdown in the past decade, despite claims to the contrary by skeptics. Some believed there was a slowdown because of an abnormally extreme El Niño weather effect in 1998 which was the second hottest year on record. As seen in the graph above, years after 1998 were seen to be cooler, leading some to suggest climate change had been slowing. However, this data shows that, although cooler than 1998, the top ten hottest years on record all came in the last 16 years - showing there has been no climate slowdown. Before 1998, no year came close to approaching these top ten in temperature. Various organisations are preparing to release data, or have already, which shows that 2014 was the hottest year on record across the globe. While some places, like the US, may have experienced a variation that caused some places to get very slightly colder, overall the global trend is a worrying increase, far faster than any natural phenomenon could cause. It heavily suggests humans are driving climate change through the emissions of CO2. In December the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) released data from the majority of 2014 pointing to a record-setting year. Data from the UK Met Office agreed with the findings. Nasa's own data is expected to confirm the findings, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) will also reveal on 16 January that 2014 was the hottest year ever. The JMA joins Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in the US, and the UK Met Office, as one of four major global temperature 'keepers' to reveal 2014 was the hottest ever. It heavily suggests humans are causing manmade global warming . Here the variations in temperature around the world for the last year can be seen. Although some regions like the US experienced a cooler year, overall the global temperature was found to be much higher on average than has ever been experienced before . 'The warmth in 2014 is also notable for another reason: the absence of El Niño,' reported Nature. 'Although Pacific temperatures were high in 2014, atmospheric conditions did not allow El Niño to form.' Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, added: 'It is surprising to have record heat in a year without strong El Niño.' He said it is a reminder that the Earth is heating up quickly. The findings by the JMA follow a release by the UN's World Meteorological Organisation in December that said 2014 was a record-setting year. Noaa is set to release its findings on 16 January, which are expected to confirm the findings of the other organisations. According to the UK Met Office last year was also the warmest in the Central England Temperature series, the longest running temperature record in the world, which stretches back to 1659, recording temperatures in an area of central England. Noaa will release its data on 16 January, which is expected to agree with that by the JMA that 2014 was the hottest ever. Hear can be seen their provisional data from 2014 up to October, although they said there was no realistic scenario where the temperatures in November and December would not make it the hottest year .","The Japan Meteorological Association has released their data for 2014 .

"Women who use a contraceptive jab are at greater risk of contracting HIV, new research suggests. A study found the jab increases a woman’s chance of becoming infected with HIV by 40 per cent compared with women using other contraceptive methods or no method. The injected contraceptive is known as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), commonly known as Depo-Provera or the birth control shot. The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, involved a review of 12 studies of more than 39,500 women. It found other forms of hormonal contraception, including oral contraceptive pills, do not appear to increase this risk. The jab increases a woman’s chance of becoming infected with HIV (pictured) by 40 per cent compared with women using other contraceptive methods or no method . However, researchers stressed that although statistically significant, the figure represents only a moderate increase in relative risk. And the risk appeared to be lower among women in the general population which saw the risk increase by 31 per cent than for women already at high risk of acquiring HIV, such as prostitutes. Worldwide about 144 million women use hormonal contraception - around 41 million use the injectable forms and 103 million take the oral contraceptive pill. Whether or not use of hormonal contraceptives increases women's risk of HIV acquisition has been hotly debated for more than two decades, but the research so far has been inconclusive. However the researchers, from the University of California at Berkeley, said their findings did not warrant the injection being withdrawn. Epidemiologist Lauren Ralph said: The moderate elevation in risk observed in our study is not enough to justify a complete withdrawal of DMPA for women in the general population. 'Banning DMPA would leave many women without immediate access to alternative, effective contraceptive options. 'This is likely to lead to more unintended pregnancies, and because childbirth remains life-threatening in many developing countries, could increase overall deaths among women.' Ms Ralph told MailOnline there are a number of reasons why the contraceptive injection may have this effect. ‘In short, both biologic and behavioral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the relationship between Depo (and other progestin-based contraceptives) and risk of HIV. But other forms of hormonal contraception, including The Pill, did not appear to increase the risk of HIV . ‘On the behavioural side, women who use hormonal contraceptive methods are different than those that do not, and these differences might also be related to their risk of HIV. For example, some evidence indicates that women using hormonal contraception use condoms less often. These differences, if not properly adjusted for in analyses, would bias estimates of the hormonal contraception-HIV relationship.' However this study had only looked at research that had adjusted for condom use. She added that lab studies had suggested the use of hormonal contraceptives might have a number of effects on the body. ‘These include ioncluding inducing structural changes to the genital tract, altering immune responses, and changing vaginal flora, that might increase women’s susceptibility to HIV. ‘However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. I’d like to emphasize though that our study did not examine the physiological effects of the different contraceptive methods - and more research on the potential underlying biologic mechanisms is needed.’","Research involved the commonly used Depo-Provera 'birth control shot'

"When Nikki Stanley, 46, went to the dentist to have her crowns replaced, she certainly didn't expect to be left with no upper teeth at all. But that is exactly what happened and six years later, Ms Stanley says she is still too embarrassed to leave the house. 'I had never been embarrassed about how my teeth are,' says the learning support assistant from London. Scroll down for video . Recluse: Nikki Stanley was aghast when she realised a bungling dentist had removed all of her upper teeth . Embarrassing: She says her teeth made her so self-conscious, she loathed leaving the house . 'Not until the age of 40 when I thought I was going in to get my teeth done and a couple of crowns fitted and ended up with no teeth.' So afraid of the dentist is Ms Stanley now, she was too frightened to get help when she began experiencing problems with her bottom teeth - and now has just five left in total. Her ordeal began six years ago when a routine procedure was badly bungled. 'When I came round back at home in my bed, I was horrified,' she says, wiping away a tear. 'I thought I was going to wake up with my teeth crowned or at least my teeth filed down ready to have the crowns fitted the next week but instead, she'd just removed my teeth.' The dentist had given her a dental plate but Ms Stanley says she wasn't told how to use the device and says wearing it is 'alien' to her. Now Ms Stanley is so self-conscious about her unsightly teeth, she is afraid to leave the house - a problem made worse by cruel bullies who insult her looks in the street. 'I'm on borrowed time, borrowed time,' she says. 'I have five teeth left and it t has really affected my life. 'I don't go out. I'm just happier staying at home. The one time I stop thinking about my appearance and what I look like is when I'm in my garden, gardening. 'I just enjoy it because I don't have to interact with anyone. I don't have to put my hand in front of my mouth when I'm talking to my plants. 'I haven't really got any quality of life to speak of. I'm happier at home than I am going out because I haven't got to face people.' Her son Nathan is horrified by the change in his formerly bubbly mother. 'The last time I went out with my mum was on my 16th birthday,' he says. 'It's been a long time. 'I'm not going to live with my mum forever,' he continues. 'I'd love to see her happy.' 'I've basically been told that I'm a mess,' adds Ms Stanley. 'I've been told that I'm an embarrassment. 'Once someone says that to you, where do you go from there?  There's nowhere else to go.' Although her son would like her to meet a new man and be happy, Ms Stanley says her hopes were dashed by the botched procedure. 'I'm single and I can't imagine meeting anyone or being with anyone like that,' she says. 'Who'd want to be with someone like me? I haven't got a life. I exist but I don't live.' Big improvement: Ms Stanley has now had all her teeth replaced with implants - and is much happier . But there is light at the end of the tunnel for Ms Stanley, after she was offered a reconstruction operation by Harley Street surgeon, Dr Anthony Zybutz. Dr Zybutz, who specialises in tooth implants, was forced to remove her remaining teeth and remove rotten stumps from her upper gums but, after eight hours in surgery, successfully completed the operation. A delighted Ms Stanley says the surgery has been life-changing. 'It's unbelievable,' she beams. 'It's just nice to go out and hold my head up and smile and not look down when people look at me. 'It was kill or cure for me. I'm so much happier now that at the end of the day, my cheeks hurt from smiling so much.' Son Nathan is similarly pleased. 'Since the surgery, my mum has been happy in herself,' he says, adding cheekily: 'She now spends a lot of time looking in the mirror smiling at herself.' 'There's nothing to stop me doing anything now,' adds Ms Stanley. 'Having the surgery has just changed my life. It really has.'","Nikki Stanley, 46, thought she was having new crowns fitted .

"A jilted teenager strangled his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend after using her Facebook posts to track her movements in Romania. Eduard Vaida, 17, began stalking Paula Dindiligan when she ended their two-year relationship alleging that he had hit her after becoming overly jealous. After his arrest, he immediately confessed to the murder and a chilling boast, he told police: 'I was looking in her eyes as she died.' Jealous and violent: Eduard Vaida, 17, murdered his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend, Paula Dindiligan, after she broke up with because he had become overly jealous and violent towards her . Paula had caught a bus to her local skating rink and when she didn't return home that evening her parents raised the alarm in their hometown of Baia Sprie in northern Romania's Maramures County. Police checked CCTV footage which showed that she had left the rink - and tracked her movements before eventually discovering her body on a patch of wasteland. Ex-boyfriend Vaida was immediately suspected by police and when he was arrested he admitted to the crime, claiming he had been drunk when he dragged off the road and killed her. He said: 'I put my hands around her neck as I lay on top of her and I strangled her. I was looking in her eyes as she died.' Pretty and popular: Paula Dindiligan was a talented flute player and was popular with friends at arts college . Stalked until her death: Eduard Vaida started tracking her movements through Facebook when she broke up with him, and claims this is how he found her on the night he killed her . He told officers that he desperately wanted to get back together with her and could not accept that she wanted to leave him - and that he had only wanted to talk to her. He admitted he had been stalking her under the belief that she might be meeting another man - and had managed to follow her by using updates on her Facebook account which told friends what she was doing. Neighbour Maria Ionescu told local TV: 'I can't really take in what is supposed to have happened. Both of them were just children really. 'They were always together and always walking around holding hands, they seemed to be very much in love. Parents raised alarm: Police were called by Paula's worried parents after she failed to return home from a nearby ice skating rink . 'I am surprised that they broke up but even more surprised that he is supposed to have killed her. I would have sworn Edi was not a violent person.' Paula was a popular student at the local Arts High-School and was a talented flute player. According to her school friends, she had previously claimed Vaida was her first love but complained that he drank too much and became violent when he was drunk. Vaida is said to have had a troubled upbringing after his mother and sister left to live in the US -leaving him living with his father, who would often take him drinking in the local pub. Police are currently having the teenager examined by a psychiatrist and if found to be sane and convicted, as a minor he could face up to ten years in a detention centre.

"A Colorado woman who studied avalanches and the science of snow died Tuesday after falling victim to the very thing she found so fascinating. Friends of the 23-year-old, who died after an avalanche swept her into some trees, say she loved skiing and was educated about slide dangers. A small slide hit backcountry skier Olivia Buchanan of Durango and she later died at a hospital. Sad: Backcountry skier Olivia Buchanan, 23, of Durango, Colorado was swept into some trees by a small avalanche outside Silverton, Colorado on Tuesday (courtesy Emma Light Photography) Buchanan was studying geography, focusing on snow science, at Montana State University in Bozeman and had been an intern at the Silverton Avalanche School. She was on the Rabbit Ears avalanche path, also known as the Arcade path, of Kendall Mountain near Silverton, Colorado when the tragedy struck. Buchanan had been skiing with a male companion when the snow slid out from under her smashed her helplessly into a tree. Her companion then rushed to begin CPR, reports the Durango Herald. Rescuers first got word of the incident around 4pm, however a rescue helicopter could only unload workers and was unable to load the unconscious Buchanan because safety issues prevented them from landing. A search and rescue team was forced to shuttle Buchanan down from the site at 11,000 feet down the darkening mountain. She was then taken to a snowmobile and then a waiting ambulance. By then it was 7pm, authorities said. She was taken by helicopter to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Tragedy: The tragedy occurred on the Rabbit Ears avalanche path, also known as the Arcade path, of Kendall Mountain near Silverton, Colorado (pictured) Studied avalanche safety: The active skier and mountain climber had interned at the Silverton Avalanche School not far from the scene of the accident . Fighting for her life: Rescuers fought to save Buchanan but a rescue helicopter was unable to fly her off the mountain. She was hauled down the mountain as the sun set, but couldn't reach a hospital until 7pm. She was then pronounced dead . Friend Taiya Andrews told The Durango Herald that Buchanan made her watch ski movies with her in the summer. While the avalanche danger is rated moderate in Colorado's mountains, Silverton school director Jim Donovan says it's been difficult to evaluate risks. He says recent warm weather may have contributed to the avalanche that killed Buchanan, Colorado's second fatal slide in a week. 'It's very tragic for the community up here,' said Donovan, who is director of the Silverton Avalanche School. Along with a photo of Buchanan in the snow, the Silverton school wrote on its Facebook: . 'We lost one of our own on January 6th. Olivia always had a great sense of humor and was very passionate about studying snow, avalanches and skiing. She will be missed. Our condolences to her friends and family.' Buchanan's body was to undergo an autopsy this week and authorities say the investigation is ongoing. Friends were shocked by the death of Buchanan, who many said was always the first to bring up issues of safety .","Backcountry skier Olivia Buchanan of Durango, Colorado was swept into some trees by a small avalanche Tuesday .

"'Moron': U.S. real-estate tycoon Donald Trump was ridiculed for blaming yesterday's massacre of journalists on France's gun-control laws . Donald Trump has been labelled a moron on Twitter for suggesting the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre were denied 'a fighting chance' by France's gun laws. In a series of tweets, the generously coiffed real-estate tycoon suggested the gunmen were only able to murder with impunity because there were no armed bystanders to shoot back. Twitter users' responses were mixed, but generally negative. The first reply, by Molly Lambourn from Melbourne, Australia, said: '[W]hat a complete idiot. More people would have f***ing died!!! Heaps of crossfire!!!' Trump's tweets, posted less than 12 hours after news broke of the slaughter in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, said: 'If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns, at least they would have had a fighting chance. 'Isn't it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world? 'Remember, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns!' By this morning, Trump had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first tweet alone, while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid. About another 80 responses mentioned the word 'idiot', although not all were directly critical of Trump. However, Trump's pronouncement was chosen as a 'favourite' by 933 people and retweeted 1,488 times, and many - though by no means the majority - of responses were supportive of his view. Responding to Trump, Terry Brown, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, wrote on Twitter: '[G]ive everyone guns - how can American murder scenes be wrong?' Canadian Cari Ramsey from London, Ontario, wrote: '[N]one of them would have had a shot! NONE! 2 guys with AK47s surprised a room. Guns would have done nothing!' Steve Dickinson, from Cumbria, told Trump: 'Just like the guys in the Boston Marathon hey Donald?' Another user who identified herself only as HillyFoz replied to the tycoon: 'THEY WERE JOURNALISTS. NOT STUPID GUN TOTING RED NECKS. GO BOIL YOUR WIG'. Trumps tweets: By this morning, Trump had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first of the three tweets alone, while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid . Moreover, gun laws in France are not so restrictive as Trump seems to believe. Possession of automatic firearms is banned across the European Union, except in special circumstances. But that law is similar in the U.S., where citizens must have permission from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to possess fully automatic weapons. In France citizens must have a licence to buy a weapon, but once one is obtained they can use it to buy handguns and even semi-automatic rifles - the kind where all you have to do is pull the trigger to fire. Both such weapons are banned in the mainland UK. 'Je suis Charlie': Journalists hold placards reading 'I am Charlie' as they hold a minute of silence at the offices of news agency Agence France Presse in Paris . Despite the law, France has long had a problem with organised criminal gangs with access Kalashnikov assault rifles, said Mark Mastaglio of the Forensic Firearms Consultancy. 'There was also a spate in France of criminals using rocket-propelled grenades for robberies and even prison breaks,' Mr Mastaglio told MailOnline. He said French criminals' relative ease of access to automatic weapons raised an important question about the circumstances of yesterday's massacre in Paris, where the gunmen fired in single shots throughout. 'If they did have fully-automatic Kalashnikovs and they opted to use single shots that suggests a degree of military training, because as you use the fully automatic fire accuracy goes down.' An injured person is carried into an ambulance after the massacre at the offices of French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France .

Seven people have been arrested over the Charlie Hebdo massacre, but two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade today remained on the run. As the manhunt for Cherif and Said Kouachi continued, their alleged getaway driver Hamyd Mourad, 18, turned himself into police in Charleville-Mezieres in northern France. The fact that two were still at large almost 24 hours after a gun battle in which two policemen died alongside ten others, mainly magazine staff, was also a cause for huge concern. France is today holding a day of mourning for the 12 people killed during the country's worst terrorist atrocity this century. A minute's silence will be observed at midday across the country and the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital will toll.","U.S. tycoon labelled a moron 38 times in response to a single tweet .

"A former Utah high school teacher had sex with an underage student after she was arrested in October 2013 in another sex abuse case involving that boy and two others, prosecutors said this week. Brianne Altice, 35, was arrested again Wednesday on four new sex abuse charges and released from jail after posting $10,000 bail, court documents say. Deputy Davis County Attorney Cristina Ortega said Altice had sex twice with a 17-year-old boy between November 2013 and August 2014 while she was out on bail in the first case. In deep: Brianne Altice, 35, was arrested again Wednesday on four new sex abuse charges and released from jail after posting $10,000 bail, court documents say . Messages left with Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, were not immediately returned Thursday. Altice faces 10 charges in the earlier case, which involves the 17-year-old and two other students. She has pleaded not guilty to six of the charges but has not yet entered a plea to the other four charges, which were filed recently. Altice taught English at Davis High School before she was fired last February. Altice was first arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of having sex with a student. In August of 2014, a second student came forward accusing Altice of carrying on a physical relationship with him as well. Now, the former educator who lost her job and saw her marriage break apart in the aftermath of the scandal faces felony counts stemming from her alleged encounters with three minors. The charges against Altice include first-degree rape, first-degree forcible sodomy and second-degree forcible sexual abuse. Altice’s attorney, Edward Brass, has said in court his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. ‘It is her defense that they did not happen at all,’ Brass wrote in a motion. ‘That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students ...’ Altice faces 10 charges in the earlier case, which involves the 17-year-old and two other students . Mounting charges: In this Jan. 3, 2014, file photo, Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice stands before the judge during her first court hearing in Farmington, Utah . Prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. But Brass has asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home last October to interview her about the allegations. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' In September, one of the teenage boys, now 18, offered graphic details during his testimony about how he went from being Altice's student to allegedly having sex with her in his Farmington home. The teen testified that he was 17-years-old when he became involved with Altice between April and June of 2013, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. He said it began with kissing between class periods and eventually graduated to sexual intercourse. When asked to describe his relationship with Brianne Altice, the teenage boy said she was his 'teacher with benefits.'

"An Air India flight from London was delayed for nearly 12 hours because there were no pilots to fly the Boeing 787 Dreamliner back to New Delhi, according to reports. The twin-engine airliner landed at Heathrow Airport on Tuesday evening after a nine-hour journey and was scheduled to return to the Indian capital the same night. But the departure did not take place because the airline ‘had not positioned any pilots in London’ to operate the aircraft's return leg, the Times of India reported, quoting an unnamed source. The return leg was delayed because Air India 'had not positioned any pilots in London', reports suggest . The flight crew who flew the Dreamliner to Heathrow from New Delhi were unable to operate the return leg because they had reached their maximum flight time and were required to take a mandatory rest period. With no one available to fly the plane the debt-ridden airline was forced to park the aircraft at Heathrow and pay for hotel rooms near Heathrow for about 200 passengers. Following their mandatory rest the pilots who flew the plane to London were behind the controls for the return flight, which departed Wednesday morning, the Times of India reported. Air India says blamed the mix-up on delays in Mumbai, which 'led to a lot of changes in crew movement' An Air India spokesperson told the newspaper: ‘Air India had operated B-777 aircraft on January 3, 4 and 5 to London in order to clear the holiday rush. ‘Thereafter, from January 6, the aircraft was reverted to B-787 and the crew was scheduled accordingly. ‘However, due to fog in Delhi, one of the flights was diverted to Mumbai, which led to lot of changes in crew movement. ‘After giving the pilots minimum applicable rest and keeping in view the night curfew in London, the flight was rescheduled to January 7 at 4am.

"Oil-rich Brunei has banned public celebrations of Christmas for fear of Muslims being led astray, its officials announced today. In a country that last year controversially instituted tough Islamic sharia penalties - such as the severing of limbs - a ban relating to all Christmas references was issued following the holiday on December 25. The tough restriction was put in place after children and adults were seen wearing clothes 'that resemble Santa Claus' - thereby promoting a religion other than Islam. Banned Christmas: Oil-rich Brunei has banned public celebrations of Christmas for fear of Muslims being led astray, it was announced today. Pictured, Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah . In April, Brunei was condemned after announcing the introduction of a penal code that will eventually include penalties such as the severing of limbs and death by stoning. The tiny state on the island of Borneo is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and relies on oil and gas exports for its prosperity. Around 20 per cent of Brunei's residents are non-Muslim, including substantial Buddhist and Christian communities. A spokesman declined to comment directly on the Christmas ban, but referred to a December 27 statement in which the religious affairs ministry said the act of publicly marking non-Islamic rituals or festivities 'can be seen as propagations of religions other than Islam'. The tough restriction was put in place after children and adults were seen wearing clothes 'that resemble Santa Claus' - thereby promoting a religion other than Islam . It noted in particular: 'For example, in conjunction with Christmas celebrations, Muslim children, teenagers and adults can be seen wearing hats or clothes that resemble Santa Claus. 'Believers of other religions that live under the rule of an Islamic country - according to Islam - may practice their religion or celebrate their religious festivities among their community, with the condition that the celebrations are not disclosed or displayed publicly to Muslims,' the statement said. 'Muslims should be careful not to follow celebrations such as these that are not in any way related to Islam... and could unknowingly damage the faith of Muslims.' Around 20 per cent of Brunei's residents are non-Muslim, including substantial Buddhist and Christian communities . The statement also said that businesses that publicly displayed Christmas decorations were asked to take them down and had given their 'full cooperation'. The latest move will likely attract more international criticism after a harsh new penal code was announced in April by Brunei's 68-year-old Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. At the time, he said: 'Today I place my faith in and am grateful to Allah the almighty to announce that tomorrow,Thursday, May 1 2014, will see the enforcement of Sharia law phase one, to be followed by the other phases.' The tiny state of Brunei on the island of Borneo is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and relies on oil and gas exports for its prosperity . The change means people can face conviction by Islamic courts and fines or jail terms for a range of offences such as pregnancy outside marriage, failure to perform Friday prayers and propagating other religions. A second phase of the law comes into effect in May this year covering theft and alcohol consumption by Muslims, which would be punishable by whipping and amputation. The death penalty, including death by stoning, will be introduced in the final phase a year later for offences such as adultery, sodomy and insulting the Koran or the Prophet Muhammad. Most of the laws will also apply to non-Muslims. U.S. television personality Ellen DeGeneres (right) and British actor Stephen Fry (left) said in April they would boycott the hotel chain owned by Brunei's sultan following the introduction of a new harsh sharia penal code . That raises concern among Western workers in the oil sector and the tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese Bruneians and 30,000 mostly Roman Catholic Filipino migrant workers living in Brunei. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights denounced the new system for applying the death penalty to a wide range of offences. In April, celebrities, including U.S. television personality Ellen DeGeneres and British actor Stephen Fry, announced they would be boycotting the hotel chain owned by the sultan on the grounds that the new laws criminalised homosexuality. The Dorchester Collection of hotels is owned by the Sultan of Brunei.","Ban issued after local children seen in clothes 'that resemble Santa Claus'

"Bulgaria's famous emerald green cat is looking a lot less colourful these days, after she was given a wash by worried animal lovers. The ludicrously-coloured moggie became an internet sensation last year after she was spotted prowling through the popular seaside resort of Varna, on the Black Sea. But all that remains of her former garish tone is slightly green ears and a patch on her chest - although her fur has kept a slightly grass-like glow. Scroll down for video . A worried animal lover gave the cat a bath to rid it of its unusual green fur . The Bulgarian cat during one of her more colourful days - believed to have been caused by sleeping on paint . People originally feared the cat, who is often seen with a ginger feline thought to be her son, was the butt of a cruel joke. But it was later realised the green shine was thanks to paint at the nearby construction yard where she sleeps. Some worried her fame had a dark side when she disappeared for three days last autumn. Residents feared she had been abducted - although others insisted that rain had washed the animal's colour away and said a similar-looking green cat was seen last year. However, it seems locals weren't willing to take the risk of losing her again - so an animal rescue team stepped in to give her a wash. Animal protection agencies are hoping that the stand-out nature of the feline won't influence owners to paint their cats. Ginger companion: The cat was pictured cosying up to another ginger moggy - believed to be her son . When the green cat first made waves on the internet it was thought that she had been deliberately painted . The famous feline's natural fur colour can be seen for the first time - albeit with a slightly green tinge . The RSPCA has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have 'potentially fatal consequences'. Some locals were quoted as saying they believe the stray cat was becoming greener each day, fuelling the idea that someone was painting it. Varna is a popular tourist destination as it is the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.

"Two California office workers expected, at the most, to have to call a plumber when their office toilet became clogged Tuesday. Instead, they had to call the county's Department of Animal Services. Stephanie Lacsa and Holly Wells of Vertical PR & Marketing in San Diego noticed the water level in the toilet of the second-floor restroom was higher than usual Tuesday, according to the LA Times. And when Lacsa went to plunge it, the water level didn't go down. Instead, a 5 1/2 foot snake came up. Scroll down for video . Curled Up: Stephanie Lacsa went to plunge her office toilet Tuesday and a 5 1/2 foot Columbian rainbow boa slithered out of the toilet and curled up in the stall . Columbian Rainbow Boa: The snake was identified as a 5 1/2-foot-6-inches-around Columbian rainbow boa, native to Columbia and northern regions of South America . 'I thought my eyes were deceiving me,' Lasca said of the moment she saw the snake's tongue flicker in the toilet. Lacsa screamed and ran from the bathroom, taping the door shut before she called animal services, FOX news reports. An animal services employee arrived to find a Columbian rainbow boa curled up behind the toilet. The employee expects the snake had been in sewers for weeks, NBC reports, as it was underweight and shedding. Wells was a bit skeptical when Lacsa first told her of the slithering situation. '[Lacsa] said, 'It's the size of my forearm,'' Wells told NBC, 'and I was like, 'No, it's the probably the size of a pencil.' But when Wells cracked the door, she saw it for herself: A more than 5-foot-long and 6-inches-around boa. The animal services employee was even shocked, telling NBC the situation was 'the stuff of urban legends.' Animal Services Deputy Director Dan DeSousa told NBC that when in the care of animal services, the snake got 'nippy' and bit its handler. Exaggerating: Lacsa (left) ran out of the stall, taped the door shut and told Holly Wells (right) of her experience, but Wells thought her co-worker was exaggerating . Facebook: Wells took to Facebook to describe the experience saying 'Happy New Years to us' Pet: Lacsa said she wonders if the old pipes in the building, built in the 1800's are to blame, NBC reports. But county animal services says the snake is most likely someone's pet (here, an animal services employee plays with the snake) The agency took the snake to an animal center for examination, the Times reports. If no one claims the snake by Friday, the boa will be given to a rescue group. Lacsa said she wonders if the old pipes in the building, built in the 1800's are to blame, NBC reports. But county animal services says the snake is most likely someone's pet. Where the snake came from and how it got into the toilet is still a mystery, as the Columbian rainbow boa is native to Columbia and northern regions of South America. It seems Lacsa and Wells weren't in much danger though. The Columbian rainbow boa is said to be the most 'calm and good tempered' of all the different species of rainbow boa.","Stephanie Lacsa, of California, went to plunge her office toilet and a 5 1/2 foot snake came slithering up .

"Tom Buchanan never told anyone about the shooting that left him carrying a bullet in his gut for 70 years . A bullet that wounded Tom Buchanan when he was a young man took 70 years to kill him. The Chicago resident died on Sunday from complications from a bullet that he carried in his abdomen for more than seven decades. He was 87 years old. Chicago police detectives now how the task of cracking the coldest of cold cases: Who shot him in the 1940s? Buchanan never talked about the shooting or hinted who did it. His 82-year-old cousin, Mattie Matthews, one of his only surviving relatives, said she only knew he had been shot because she remembers her mother and his mother talking about. Buchanan was admitted to Chicago's Mercy Hospital on Saturday, days after he began feeling pain in his gut. By the time Ms Matthews convinced him to seek medical care, he was holding his stomach and in severe pain. He was pronounced dead shortly after 11am on Sunday. An autopsy by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office determined that 'gunshot ultimately caused the complications to his abdomen that ultimately killed him.' His death was ruled a homicide. His heart disease was listed as a contributing factor in his death. Frank Shuftan, a spokesman for the medical examiner's office, said family members that investigators have spoken to have been able to shed little light on the shooting. 'We don't know anything about it,' he said. Ms Matthews, said Buchanan, a retired steel worker, never served in the military, so he could not have been shot in the war. She said Buchanan, a quiet man who never married or had any children, died without telling her what happened - even though she was probably the closest relative and friend that he had. All she knew about the shooting came from a conversation she overheard among grown-ups when she was a child. 'I was about 10 or 12 years old when I heard my aunt and my mother talking about how he had gotten shot but I never heard anything else and he (Buchanan) never talked about it to me,' she said of the shooting. She believes it must have happened not long after Buchanan and his mother moved from Mississippi to Chicago. Matthews said she recalled that conversation last week when Buchanan started talking about a pain in his gut. She said her cousin was the kind of man who didn't want anybody to make a fuss, and initially wouldn't even consider leaving the independent living facility on the city's South Side to see a doctor. 'But when I went Saturday he was holding his stomach and I told him I was taking him to the hospital because he was getting worse.'","Tom Buchanan was shot in the 1940s when he was a young man .

"A deadly scorpion has been living in a mother-of-two's home for three months after hitching a 9,000 mile lift in her suitcase from Australia. Carol Cook suffered the fright of her life when she spotted the three inch-critter scuttling through her home. The 51-year-old is unwittingly thought to have brought the creature back to her home in Stansted, Essex,  after enjoying a three week holiday in Australia at the end of September last year. Wildlife experts have now identified it as a lethal Bark Scorpion whose sting is powerful enough to kill children and elderly people. Carol Cook, 51, discovered the Bark Scorpion living in her home three months after returning from a holiday in Australia . Her husband, Gary, 51, bravely scooped their unwelcome house guest into a glass after it made an appearance in their kitchen. The couple have now nicknamed the creature the 'Beast of Stansted' and it is currently living with them in a rectangular plastic takeaway tub until a new owner can be found. At one stage they thought the little creature had died only for him to spring back to life when the heating was turned on. Card merchandiser Mrs Cook said: 'When I saw him I was jumping around screaming and so was my daughter, Billie, but Gary stepped up to deal with it. The scorpion was believed to have travelled over 9,000 miles in Mrs Cook's suitcase from Australia to her home in Stansted, Essex . 'He's the one in house who deals with spiders - it's always been his job since we married so this was one for him to deal with. 'He was quite calm considering what was going on - a lot calmer than me, that's for sure. The nocturnal critter is considered one of the most dangerous scorpions in the world by wildlife experts . 'I've seen the movie The Scorpion King so I know what they are capable of.' The mum-of-two added: 'We came back from three weeks out in Australia at the end of September and he may well have come back in our suitcase and then just been living in the house. 'It's a real possibility that he is from Down Under as they can survive for a long time without food. The family have nicknamed the scorpion 'Beast of Stansted' and are keeping it in their home . 'It creeps me out to think he has been with us for all that time. 'I have certainly not got friendly with him and he won't be staying here for much longer.' Wildlife experts believe the light and dark brown scorpion to be an American Bark Scorpion which are commonly found in Florida and Arizona. Wildlife experts said that venom from Mrs Cook's scorpion' could potentially kill a very young child . Iain Newby, who runs the Dangerous Wild Animal Rescue Facility, said people travelling the world every day made such occurrences very plausible. He said: 'Everyone travels the world, somebody from America could have gone to Australia. 'Then Mrs Cook comes back to the UK with her new friend - a scorpion can hide in a little tiny two-inch pocket in a briefcase and you would not even know it was there. 'They curl up and they hide, like spiders.' Mr Newby warned that the scorpion should not be underestimated. He added: 'If you are under five years old and are stung by it, there's a possibility you are going to die. The critter has been described by wildlife experts as one of the most dangerous scorpions in the world. Bark Scorpions are commonly found in the Sonoran Desert in the south west of the United States and Mexico. Their venom has been compared to that in deadly snakes and they are considered incredible hard to kill. They were even found at the site of ground zero after the Twin Towers collapsed. They range in size from around two to three inches and are a light colour, so can blend in well with their surroundings. Unusually they tend to live in large packs and stick to desert regions. They ambush their prey and then sting it from behind. Their diet normally consists of roaches, crickets and beetles. The Bark Scorpions has a lifespan of approximately five years. Its venom is said to cause severe pain and in rare cases even death. The very young and elderly are said to be most at risk from its sting. 'If you are over 70, there is a possibility you are going to die. If you are fit and healthy, it is going to hurt like bugger. 'It would be like 50 bee stings - you may not die but the hurt is going to hurt. 'I would not mess around with it at all. 'It might even be gravid and it might give birth to live young.' Mrs Cook said her friends were amazed that the scorpion had been allowed to stay in the house after it was found earlier this week. She added: 'We're not taking any chances. The lid is on the take-away box and we've just made some small holes in there for air. 'My friends have been saying I must be mad to keep it in the house - especially as they often live in pairs, so I am hoping this one was a loner. 'I did think he had died but as soon as the heating went on, he was back to life. 'He is still very much alive and with us.' Scorpions are hardy creatures, able to survive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth and were even found at Ground Zero with no adverse effects. They are found on every continent except Antarctica. Scorpions are not native to the UK but colonies have been established after the species was introduced. In all, around 1,750 species of scorpions have been identified. Of these, only about 25 are known to have venom capable of killing a human.","Mother-of-two Carol Cook, 51, returned from Australia three months ago .

"Former Canadian Broadcasting Corp radio host Jian Ghomeshi embroiled in a sex scandal now faces additional charges of assaulting three more women. Ghomeshi, 47, was charged Thursday with the three new counts of sexual assault. He was charged in November with four counts of sexual assault and one of choking stemming from alleged incidents involving three other women. His lawyer, Marie Henein, said he will plead not guilty to all eight charges. More legal trouble: Jian Ghomeshi, a former celebrity radio host who has been charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, arrives at court in Toronto January 8 . Under fire: Ghomeshi, 47, was charged Thursday with the three new counts of sexual assault . The three new alleged assaults took place in August 2002, July 2003 and February 2008, Crown prosecutor Michael Callaghan said in court, reported Toronto Star. Dressed in a grey suit and black tie, and flanked by his lawyer, Ghomeshi stayed silent as he left the courthouse in Toronto Thursday. He was greeted by a large crowd of reporters, curious onlookers and protesters, some of whom heckled him. One woman was heard yelling, 'castrate him!' according toThe Globe and Mail. The CBC fired Ghomeshi, the host of the internationally syndicated music-and-arts show ‘Q’ heard on public stations in 180 US cities, in October in response to media reports about the allegations. Ghomeshi has maintained his innocence, saying he had consensual ‘rough sex’ with women, which he compared to ‘a mild form of Fifty Shades of Grey.' He initially sued his former employer claiming wrongful termination but later withdraw the $55million lawsuit. The CBC said it had seen graphic evidence that he had injured a woman in what Ghomeshi said were consensual sex acts involving bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism. In his seven years at the helm of Q, Ghomeshi interviewed numerous A-list celebrities including Woody Allen, Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney. The Q show, now being hosted by other people, is carried on Public Radio International and has had a wide following on National Public Radio. Embroiled: He was charged in November with four counts of sexual assault and one of choking, bringing the total number of charges against him to eight . Sacked: The 47-year-old host of the popular culture radio show 'Q' was relieved of duties in October . Since Ghomeshi's November arrest, the CBC has launched an internal investigation into whether senior managers ignored the host's behavior because he boosted the broadcaster's ratings, particularly among a younger demographic. Ghomeshi, who remains free on $100,000 bail, is due back in court February 4, when a preliminary hearing is expected to begin, but he is not expected to appear in person. His bail conditions, which include living with his mother in Toronto's north end until the trial, were renewed. The CBC is struggling to contain the fallout from the allegations, which recall the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal at the BBC. The UK broadcaster was accused of turning a blind eye to the sexual assaults because of Savile's celebrity. The CBC placed two executives on leave of absence Monday. The allegations, first reported in the media in October, rocked the Canadian public broadcaster, a vaunted Canadian institution. Ghomeshi defended his actions in a 1,500- word statement on Facebook then, saying he had consensual 'rough sex' with women and is the victim of a disgruntled ex-girlfriend. Jian Ghomeshi, a prominent former Canadian Broadcast Corp. radio host, was charged with four counts of sexual assault on Wednesday . Canned: CBC fired Ghomeshi in October, saying his firing was prompted by the emergence of 'graphic' evidence that he had caused physical injury to a person . After the Toronto Star reported several more allegations days later, Ghomeshi posted that he would confront the allegations 'directly,' but wouldn't discuss them with the media. One of the 12 women who have contacted police since October was actress Lucy DeCoutere, a star of the long-running TV and film series Trailer Park Boys. DeCoutere, who also serves as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force, was the first woman who made allegations against Ghomeshi to speak on the record about her experience. DeCoutere said she went on a date with him and alleges that when they returned to his home, he pressed her up against a wall, choked her and slapped her across the face several times. Author and lawyer Reva Seth became the second woman to go public, writing in the Huffington Post that Ghomeshi put his hands around her throat and sexually assaulted her, although it was not known if she was one of the women who filed a complaint to police against Ghomeshi. Seth described in the blog how Ghomeshi was 'funny and charming,' when the pair first started seeing each other casually. But one evening, she claims, his behaviour suddenly changed. Accuser: Reva Seth (pictured right) says she met Jian Ghomeshi (left) in 2002 as a 26-year-old after starting a new job in Toronto, Canada . Speaking out: Actor and Air Force Captain Lucy DeCoutere during a video interview with the Star in regards to her past personal experiences and interactions with CBC host Jian Ghomeshi. Lucy was the first one to speak out publicly about Jian Ghomeshi's hitting and choking . She wrote: 'When it was over, I got up and it was clear I was really angry. My sexual interactions until then had always been consensual, enjoyable and fun. 'He gave me some weird lines about how he couldn't tell if I was actually attracted to him or not. And somehow this was meant to explain his behaviour.' Afterwards she decided not to involve the police and opted not to come forward fearing the impact of online trolls. But she eventually decided to reveal her identity after hearing Lucy DeCoutere speaking on CBC about her 'remarkably similar experience'. None of the allegations from any of the women have been proven.","Jian Ghomeshi once hosted Q on CBC radio before he was fired in the wake of a growing sex abuse scandal .

"A mother 'begged' doctors not to let her baby die after ambulance staff failed to treat her as an emergency, an inquest has heard. Ambulance crew did not appreciate  Lacey-Marie Poton's 'time critical' condition as they were driving her to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and did not use blue lights on the journey, a coroner was told. She died in the arms of her mother Emma Norley around four hours later. Her inquest is the seventh to take place into the care of child heart patients at the hospital. Emma Norley, pictured with daughter Lacey-Marie, 'begged' doctors not to let her baby die after ambulance staff failed to treat her as an emergency, an inquest has heard . Lacey-Marie was born with a complex heart condition and underwent three operations at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children in 2013. On July 24, the four-month-old had a stent procedure to improve oxygen flow to her lungs and began vomiting the following day. Lacey-Marie was discharged on July 26 but became 'shivering, shaking and pale' on the journey to her home in Fishponds, Bristol, her parents claim. Her mother, 21, reported Lacey-Marie's condition to the hospital but was told to take her to see a GP as it was 'nothing to worry about', Avon Coroner's Court was told. A receptionist at the GP surgery refused to schedule an appointment as Lacey-Marie appeared too unwell and her parents rushed her to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. After an examination, Miss Norley and partner Jhonny Poton were informed Lacey-Marie had gastroenteritis and would be discharged with Dioralyte. But just 10 minutes after returning home, Lacey-Marie went into cardiac arrest and Miss Norley had to perform CPR while an ambulance was called. 'The ambulance arrived within 10 minutes and the paramedics did not think there was anything wrong with Lacey-Marie,' Miss Norley told the inquest in a statement. Ambulance crew did not appreciate Lacey-Marie Poton's 'time critical' condition as they were driving her to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, a coroner was told. She is pictured with her father Jhonny Poton . 'I told them I had just performed CPR but they did not seem to understand why I had had to. 'Despite having told the operator on the phone that the patient was a baby, the ambulance did not seem to be properly equipped. 'She was not treated as an emergency and no blue light was used throughout the journey even though Lacey-Marie was still crying and grunting.' Miss Norley said hospital staff were 'shouting' at the paramedics when the ambulance arrived as they had not been told Lacey-Marie was coming. CPR was administered as Lacey-Marie had stopped breathing again but a cardiologist did not arrive for around 15 minutes. The baby's condition stabilised and she was admitted to the intensive care ward, where she deteriorated and was given a 50 per cent chance of survival. 'I was crying my eyes out and begged him (a cardiologist) to save her,' Miss Norley said. 'I ran into intensive care and held Lacey-Marie in my arms as she passed away.' A post-mortem examination on Lacey-Marie concluded her death was due to congenital heart disease and Down's Syndrome. Pathologist Dr Michael Ashworth said the baby was born with a large hole between the right and left side of her heart and 'severe narrowing' of blood vessels. Lacey-Marie's inquest is the seventh to take place into the care of child heart patients at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children (pictured) The inquest heard an internal report by South Western Ambulance Service found 'the crew did not recognise the time critical nature of the baby and therefore conveyed the patient at normal road speed without a pre-alert to the hospital'. Paramedic Kevin Brown told the hearing, in Flax Bourton, near Bristol, the baby seemed 'alert' and a normal colour when he arrived. 'It was decided to go under normal conditions to the hospital,' the emergency care assistant said. 'Looking back, I may have assumed it due to the fact that the baby was relatively stable and to monitor the baby in the back of the ambulance at high speed with the sirens going is difficult. 'She was obviously poorly.. It was obvious we needed to go to hospital. She appeared pale and mottled which is a red flag.' Mr Brown said he felt putting blue lights on may have reduced the four-mile journey time by 'one to two minutes'. The inquest heard the ambulance took 22 minutes and 19 seconds to transport Lacey-Marie to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. Adrian South, deputy clinical director of South Western Ambulance Service, said in his opinion Lacey-Marie suffered respiratory and not cardiac arrest at home. He told the inquest the journey from Miss Norley's home to the hospital usually takes 25 minutes by car. 'The blue lights were not on but the ambulance was not going slowly,' he added. Paediatric cardiologist Tatjana Rjabova said she believed the baby had gastroenteritis after examining her on July 27. 'Mum was happy to try Dioralyte and go home if that was successful,' she said. 'I went over the plans with A and E staff. I said she could go home if she looked well and mum was happy, and if not she should be admitted.' Miss Norley had to perform CPR on Lacey-Marie while an ambulance was called, the coroner was told . Ms Rjabova said she received a call to attend the hospital that evening as Lacey-Marie was in resuscitation. She was the first cardiologist on the scene, arriving 10 to 15 minutes later, the inquest heard. Suzanne Dean, consultant in paediatric intensive care, described the resuscitation attempts to the hearing. 'I don't know why she died,' Dr Dean said. 'I never got to the point where I could explain what had caused it. That's why we gave such broad treatment.' Dr Dean said she was aware of other children with Lacey-Marie's heart defects who suddenly fatally collapsed, with experts unable to ascertain why. Paramedic Nicholas Stock admitted that using blue lights on the journey to hospital 'would have made a difference'. Mr Stock said he arrived at Lacey-Marie's home to find the baby 'alert and crying' on the floor next to her mother. 'I pointed out that she was rather floppy, mum said this was because of her Down's Syndrome,' he said. 'I pointed out she was pale and mottled, mum said she was a cardiac patient and always pale and mottled.' Mr Stock decided to take Lacey-Marie to hospital but told the inquest he did not arrange how this would be done. 'We didn't have a formal discussion of how she would be transferred to hospital and we just left,' he said. 'I feel I was probably a bit blinkered and I didn't raise the issue of whether we would drive with blue lights or not. We arrived at the hospital 22 minutes later. 'A patient with cardiac history with a query cardiac arrest that is pale and floppy should be blue lighted to the ED. 'I appreciate there has been talk that blue lights wouldn't have made much of a difference but they would have made some difference so that should have been done.' Mr Stock confirmed he has received further training since the tragedy. The inquest was adjourned for the day and will resume at 11am tomorrow.

"The judge in the divorce case between New York City banker Sage Kelly and his ex-wife Christina has called their trial a 'fiasco.' Justice Matthew Cooper said that the pair's behavior was 'horrible,' and that he felt bad for their 'innocent children.' This as Sage Kelly, a $7 million-a-year Manhattan banker who worked at Jefferies & Co., recently settled with his wife Christina for an undisclosed amount of money. The settlement also includes joint custody of the couples two daughters, 10-year-old Cameron and 6-year-old Logan. Moving on: Sage Kelly has settled his divorce with wife Christina (above with their two daughters) out of court for a very pricey, and undisclosed, sum . Reunited: As past of the settlement agreement, the couple will share joint custody of their two daughters (above) 'This ended up as horrible as it can be for Mr. Kelly and I guess to some extent for Ms. Kelly, but most of all for the children,' Cooper said, according to the New York Post. Sage's lifestyle became very public knowledge in October when Christina’s 26-page affidavit in their divorce was made public, which described in detail her husband's alleged cocaine use and sexual hijinks. At one point Christina, 39, graphically detailed a cocaine-fueled foursome she and Sage had with the head of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Marc Beer, and his girlfriend at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston. Christina said Sage wanted her involved to get Beer's business for his company, and that she engaged with both Beer and his girlfriend in sexual activity. Battling spouses: Christina counter-sued Sage in August of this year after he won full custody of their daughters when he filmed her doing cocaine in the Manhattan apartment . Revenge affidavit: Christina filed a 26-page affidavit accusing her husband of sexual promiscuity and rampant drug use . Getting dragged in: Christina claimed she and Sage had a cocaine-fuled foursome with pharemcutical big wig Marc Beer (left) and his girlfriend, and that Sage's boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello (right), used cocaine . In her affidavit Christina also claims that Sage slept with the wife of a coworker while her husband was sleeping in their guest bedroom and that he hosted a Mushroom Day at their swanky Sag Harbor vacation home, where guests all ingested the hallucinogenic fungi. Christina also accused a number of Sage's friends, including his boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello, of using cocaine. Sage, 42, who has denied all of his wife's allegations, would not comment on the divorce settlement. He did previously admit that he and his wife had used drugs 'at certain social events in the past,'  but stated 'the Wolf of Wall Street tale [Christina] tells this court is a work of fiction.' Christina has had her own problems with the law, having been caught on video inside the couple's house doing cocaine just this past July and being charged with felony DWI and endangering the welfare of a child after she crashed her Range Rover into a telephone pole in May 2010 while her two young daughters were in the backseat. Shattered past: Christina admits now that she has a drug and alcohol problem that she is working on, having been charged with DWI in 2010 (mugshot on left) while he daughters were in the car, while Sage claims his wife's affidavit is a work of 'fiction' Because of this, Sage won custody of their two daughters, which led his wife to counter-sue and her affidavit to become public. Now it seems that both parties are ready to move on and enjoy a more private life. Said Christina, 'I’d like to put this behind us and move forward with a new chapter in my life as Christina di Mauro.' A source close to the case also revealed that Christina said in a statement that Sage is 'a great father who greatly loves our children' and that the two are 'both fully committed to co-parenting our children.' Christina also apologized to those who had been affected by this very public battle, specifically 'those at Jefferies and those associated with Jefferies.' She also said this 'amicable' settlement 'ensures loving homes for our children.'","Sage Kelly, the $7million-a-year head of health care investment at Jefferies & Co. in New York City, has settled his pricey divorce out of court .

"Ever wondered what it's like to be a fish, bird or horse? Well, the wait is over. A  range of immersive helmets that let you see the world though different animals' eyes, such as a   chameleon’s, have been created. The metal devices use optical tricks to enable people to experience the hyper-stereo vision of a hammerhead shark, or the 357° view of a horse running in the Grand National. Scroll down for video . Carefully crafted metal helmets use optical tricks to let people experience the hyper-stereo vision of a hammerhead shark (pictured), or the 357° view a horse sees during the Grand National . Irish artists Clearly Connolly have spent years developing a series of aluminium helmets which explore ‘the mysteries of visual perception’. The helmets first went on display at the National Museum of Ireland in November and are now at the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris until February. Anne Cleary and Denis Connolly were inspired to make the helmets after exploring the pioneering experiments by psychologist George Malcolm Stratton in the early twentieth century. He wore specially adapted glasses that inverted images up and down and left and right for over a week and discovered that the human brain could adapt to these new conditions. Irish artists Clearly Connolly have spent years developing a series of hand-crafted aluminium helmets which explore ‘the mysteries of visual perception.’ Here, an individual tries on the horse helmet, which effectively puts their eyes on the side of their head so they can experience the 357° view as if they are a horse . Anne Cleary and Denis Connolly were inspired to make the helmets (an illustration is pictured) after exploring the pioneering experiments by psychologist George Malcolm Stratton in the early twentieth century . The Irish artists' helmets are inspired by the work of George M Stratton. In an experiment conducted in the early to mid 20th century, he wore specially made glasses that turned the world upside down and swapped left and right. He did this for a whole week and slept with a blindfold on to ensure that his vision didn't revert to normal. While the experience was initially unpleasant and disorientating, within a few days, the scientist's brain learned to make sense of the visual information. Astonishingly, after a week, he said that his upside-down world felt relatively normal, indicating his brain adapted relatively easily to the changes. The animal helmets are designed to make wearers question why humans see the world as we do and why our vision is so limited, while animals see their surroundings differently. This is achieved by using carefully set up mirrors inside the helmets to direct the light into a person’s eyeballs. They work in a similar way to a periscope to achieve a desired effect, such as allowing someone to see backwards, or an elevated view, without raising their head. The ‘Meta-Perceptual Helmets’ give humans the opportunity to experience the hyper-stereo vision of the hammerhead shark, so it is as if their eyes are spread much further apart. In 2009, scientists discovered that despite the shark's distinctive head shape, including its protruding eyes, the animal actually see like a human using binocular vision, but with added benefits. The predator also has stereo vision to enjoy a sweeping view of its surroundings, far superior to that of humans. These ‘Meta-Perceptual Helmets’ give humans the opportunity to experience the hyper-stereo vision of the hammerhead shark (pictured). Its wide set eyes allow the shark to see 360 degrees, which enables it to hunt prey such as squid that are able to propel themselves swiftly in any direction . While the hammerhead shark (stock image) has a large blind spot in the centre of its field of vision - in front of its head – it solves this by swinging its head form side-to-side as it swims, so it has a clear view all around itself, including above and below .

Another shiny helmet lets wearers try the backward/forward vision of the chameleon, using metal 'spouts' coming up from the top of the helmet, with mirrors inside. Chameleons arguably have the most distinctive eyes among reptiles, with a scaly cone-shaped lid and small round opening in the middle for a pupil. One of the helmets enables people to see like a chameleon. It is the not the first headset to be developed that allows humans to experience the sensation of seeing in two separate directions at one, as seen in this video . One shiny helmet lets wearers try the backward/forward vision of the chameleon (left) which can focus its eyes independently to look at two objects at the same time, while another helmet gives the the viewpoint of a horse (right), which has a blind spot that humans may find frustrating . The sleek aluminium helmets, which were hand crafted by master coachbuilder Neil McKenzie, hide optics similar to those used in a periscope to 'bend' light and give different effects, such as seeing behind and at an elevated level. Here, the helmets are shown mid way through their production . The lizard can rotate and focus its eyes independently to look at two objects at the same time – something that is difficult and disorientating for wearers of the helmet. This unusual ability gives the lizard a 360-degree view around its body and when it sees prey, it is able to focus both eyes in the same direction to get a clear view and accurately gauge its depth before launching its sticky tongue to catch a fly, for example. A giraffe-inspired helmet gives wearers the feeling of being taller than they are, while another lets them explore the wide peripheral vision of a horse, including its challenging blind spot at the centre of its vision, as if their eyes are on the sides of their head. The position of the horse's eyes affords the animal a wide, circular view of 350-degrees so it can spot predators sneaking up behind it, but just 65-degrees of their vision is binocular. Because its binocular vision - seeing with both eyes - is directed down its nose, the horse has a blind spot in front of its forehead. But it has the largest eyes of all land mammals, so it can easily detect the tiniest of movements . The artists have also designed two helmets inspired by mythology and literature, allowing people to see the world through the eyes of the Cheshire cat from Alice and Wonderland (pictured) and Cyclops . The two helmets based on literature and mythology give people an imaginative experience of seeing in a bizarre way. A 16th century illustration of cyclops is pictures left, and an illustration of the Cheshire Cat, right . ‘The Cheshire Cat Helmet (a sketch is pictured) is so called because of the strange lingering effect of dominating visual information such as a smile or the eyes,’ the artists explained .

"Earlier this week, a charger that could power a device from 20ft away was revealed, and now visitors to the Consumer Electronics Show have been treated to one that charges devices in just 30 seconds. In less than the time it takes to boil a kettle, StoreDot can take a phone’s battery from zero to fully charged thanks to a breakthrough in nanotechnology. It was showcased at the Las Vegas event, which has also displayed smart dartboards, a three-wheeled car and Meccano's Short Circuit-style dancing robot. Scroll down for videos . StoreDot technology was first demonstrated last year, but the prototype at the time was too chunky to fit inside slim phones. But the latest model of the StoreDot phone and charging dock (pictured) being shown off at CES, has been streamlined. The company plans to make it even thinner by 2016 . StoreDot technology was first demonstrated last year, but the prototype at the time was too chunky to fit inside slim phones. But the latest model of the StoreDot phone, being shown off at CES, has been streamlined and the company plans to make it even thinner by 2016. The technology was developed at Tel Aviv University. Researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge or emit light. The crystals - dubbed NanoDots - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides. They cover 'cavities' over an electrode in a standard battery. This extends how much of the battery can be used to create a reaction, which leads to a charge. StoreDot claims NanoDots can boost battery capacity tenfold. At one end of the electrode, the crystals act as a capacitor to store energy. At the other end, the crystals pass this energy into the battery’s lithium at much faster speeds and efficiency than current batteries. The technology was developed at Tel Aviv University. Researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge, or emit light. The crystals - dubbed NanoDots - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides. The experts said they are easy and cheap to make, and are non-toxic. The firm is working on using the crystals, which it calls NanoDots, for displays and semiconductors as well as batteries. For example, the NanoDots can replace toxic materials like cadmium used in displays, and can be created in a wide variety of colours. The technology can’t be fitted to existing phones because the current batteries wouldn’t be able to handle the surge and change in power. But the team behind the project told the BBC that a number of major manufacturers have approached the company to licence the technology. This could see it introduced on next-generation handsets as standard. Samsung announced its Galaxy Edge phone last year, and has been demonstrating the curved screen model all this week. An LG-branded phone is on display that featured a similar curved screen, which bends around the sides, according to reports by Korean news site inews24. StoreDot (original prototype pictured) was developed at Tel Aviv University. Researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge or emit light. The crystals - dubbed NanoDots - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides . However, the phone was only showcased to a select group of people and was built by LG Display. LG Display create screen technology for other companies and LG told MailOnline the handset was a prototype display, and not a prototype phone being developed for consumers. At this year's show, LG has also launched a range of innovative household products including a dual-washing machine, and a fridge within a fridge. Hong Kong firm Muudarts revealed prototypes of its smart darts and boards (pictured). When used together, sensors on the dart track its speed, trajectory and location, while the board scores the game automatically . Muudarts' wristband is also on display. It tracks the users throw and gives feedback via an app (pictured). Prices weren’t announced, and the firm said its smart products are ‘coming soon’ And during tests, it demonstrated that its power pack 80V battery is so powerful it can lift a 12lb (5kg) bowling ball when the pack is fitted in a vacuum cleaner, for example. Wearables have been a common theme across the event, and there are even fitness trackers for darts.

Typically, 3D printing uses plastics - although machines have been built that use chocolate and even pancake batter. MakerBot has taken this a step further and developed a range of plastic materials designed to mimic wood, metal and stone. It said the wood can be sanded, and the metals can be developed to be magnetic, similar to some real metals - but exactly how this plastic will become magnetised has not been revealed. It could contain tiny particles of metal or filaments, for example. The firm also said the weight of each material is similar to what the user would expect, and they will go on sale later this year. Prices were not announced. Elsewhere, Meccano demonstrated its 4ft-tall (1.2 metre) Meccanoid G15 KS robot that can mirror a person’s movements, remember audio, walk and dance. Elio is the same length as a Honda Fit, but half the weight at 1,250lbs (570kg), allowing it to do 84 miles to the gallon.

"A 92-year-old grandmother died after waiting five hours for an ambulance to turn up following four 999 calls only to arrive at hospital and wait another 14 hours in A&E for a bed. Bridget Forde, a former nurse and devoted church-goer, was left lying in agony on a freezing floor after injuring her hip in a fall at her home in Muswell Hill, north London. Her daughter Helen raised the alarm with emergency services but was forced to watch her mother drift in and out of consciousness for several hours as they waited for paramedics to turn up. Ms Forde rang 999 a total of four times over a five-hour period until an ambulance eventually arrived at the property to take her mother to hospital. Bridget Forde, 92, was left lying in agony for four hours after a delay in getting an ambulance to her when she injured her hip in a fall. After being taken to hospital, she waited 14 hours for a bed and died six days later . Ms Forde, who is almost blind, said she was repeatedly told by operators that no emergency help was available. Paramedics were said to be 'shocked' at the elderly grandmother's condition when they eventually arrived at her home last month. The former nurse and care worker was taken to Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, but was forced to wait another 14 hours in A&E for a bed to become available. She died of pneumonia just six days later. Now, Ms Forde, from Hampstead, has said she would rather 'end my life than grow old in the UK' after claiming the slow ambulance response time and 'in crisis' NHS were to blame for her mother's death. She said: 'The last terrible memory I have of my mother is of her lying on that cold floor in agony. 'It's something I can never nor forget. 'My mum was such a lovely lady - a committed Christian who loved her neighbours more than herself. 'As a nurse, child minder and then carer for the elderly, she spent her entire life looking after others. Mrs Forde's daughter, Helen (pictured), said she would rather 'end my life than grow old in the UK' and believes her mother, a former nurse and care worker, died because of the ambulance delay and 'in crisis' NHS . Mrs Forde was taken to Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London (pictured), but was forced to wait a further 14 hours in A&E for a hospital bed to become available. She died just six days later from pneumonia . 'She lived here for 50 years and was the kind of person who would always help others. 'She was so loved that her grateful community gave her an ""outstanding neighbour"" award. 'But when she needed help herself she was treated like an animal. 'It is clear the NHS is in crisis and it's high time the political point-scoring and fingerpointing stop. 'I have no children of my own to help look after me when I'm old and seeing what happens to the elderly in today's NHS has been truly terrifying. 'When I'm 80, I'm tempted to head to Switzerland [where euthanasia is legal].' Ambulance waiting times across London have got increasingly worse over the last nine months, with the borough of Haringey being the hardest   hit. Of the delay in getting paramedics to Mrs Forde, a London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were extremely busy and are very sorry for the delay and for any further distress this will have caused.' A Whittington Health Trust spokesman added: 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Ms Forde. 'In common with other NHS trusts we are experiencing high demand for our services. 'We endeavoured to make Ms Forde as comfortable as possible while she was in A&E, and kept her under close and regular observation.'","Bridget Forde suffered hip injury after fall at home in Muswell Hill, London .

'It was a person that I remember 14 years ago,' Mitchell's wife Wendy says. His son Zach adds: 'I'm just so proud of him and what he's accomplished.' Through 15 weeks of grueling training, Mitchell went from 366lbs to a lighter 242lbs. Topping off his transformation, he also received a wardrobe makeover and haircut. The father-of-five told the Associated Press that he really struggled with his weight during his career which saw him play for teams including the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals and Baltimore Ravens. He said he routinely gained 15 to 20 pounds each off-season but when he retired in 2001 things spiraled out of control.

'There were no more football seasons to get ready for,' he recalled. 'I had worked out because of my job, and after retiring I kind of resented exercise because of that. So I just slowly put on weight.' Mitchell's health gradually suffered with sleep apnea and high blood pressure kicking in. He was also borderline diabetic. In a bid to get back to his former self, he agreed to take The Biggest Loser challenge filled with dread. Besides the physical demands he knew lay ahead, he was living with shame he neither wanted to confront nor share with an audience of millions. 'You have no idea how terrified I was,' he said. 'Pro athletes don't have emotional issues - or aren't supposed to. You can't show any kind of weakness. There's no crying in football.'

And, yes, he cried. In particular, he recalled a morning hike when he 'just lost it' and 'sobbed uncontrollably'. '[I thought] about how in my life I was focusing on the things that brought me pain and sorrow, and how that was a big part of why I gained weight. I wanted to quit. I didn't want to deal with it."" But he did. 'I realized I had shut myself off emotionally, and when I opened myself up, there was a lot more to me than I was giving myself credit for.

"Our love affair with hipster foods such as prosecco, pulled pork and pancetta is coming to an end as more and more of us get fed up of hearing about them. Ultimate menu brags such as sea bass, kale, slow roast meat  and couscous are also getting short shrift, although Gwyneth Paltrow's favourite quinoa is still going strong. The growing backlash comes as a result of friends boasting and posting pictures of their latest foray into fashionable food online. Scroll down for video . No more for us: The survey revealed that 32 per cent of Britons are tired of hearing about pulled pork . Cupcakes (32 per cent) Pulled pork (32 per cent) Smoothies (17 per cent) Prosecco (12 per cent) Sea bass (five per cent) Kale (five per cent) North African dishes (five per cent) Pancetta (four per cent) Slow roast meat (three per cent) Haggis (two per cent) Surprisingly, haggis, a traditional Scottish dish also made the list, with two per cent of those surveyed said they had heard enough about the sheep's lung, liver and heart delicacy. Cute cupcakes and the seemingly ubiquitous pulled pork took joint first place with 32 per cent saying they were tired of the foods. Five per cent said they were fed up with healthy kale while 17 per cent claimed they had had enough of smoothies. North African cuisine, which includes couscous and dishes such as lamb tagine, also made it on the list, with five per cent saying they are tired of it. Our fascination with Prosecco is also losing its sparkle with 12 per cent saying the fizz is more naff than posh. Four per cent are fed up with pancetta and claim it's just a fancy Italian name for chopped bacon while three per cent say those who serve slow roasts have nothing to do all day but cook. The YouGov survey, which was conducted on behalf of Bacofoil, asked consumers which foods they think have become 'too popular' on social media and in general. 'Food trends come and go so it's inevitable that people will get tired of things and want to move on,' said Adrian Brown, managing director of Bacofoil. Cupcakes (32 per cent) and kale (five per cent) also made it into the top ten must not have foods list . Four per cent say that the word pancetta is simply a fancy way of describing bacon . 'When Bacofoil was invented in the 1960s, fondues were all the rage along with prawn cocktail and funnily enough they're now making a bit of a comeback. 'By contrast, cupcakes are full of calories and they're artificial in flavour. So it's a case of being naughty but not nice. 'I think we'll see a return of proper old fashioned cakes like Dundee cake, Bakewell tarts and malt loaf. The sort of cakes that your grandma would make and keep in a tin. 'Foods like clothes go in and out of fashion. Cup cakes and pulled pork turned up everywhere last year. 'But this year we're likely to see a move away from anything too fancy or artificial which is why cup cakes have become less popular and people are rediscovering grandmas' cakes recipes which are simple and wholesome.' He added: 'The results of the research will be of interest to companies with an eye on new product development and consumers who want to avoid serving up the dishes that are considered boring.'

"A luxury car left in a 30-minute parking space has been there so long nature has started to reclaim it, with grass sprouting from the bonnet of the fully taxed, insured and MoT'd black BMW 320i. Police and council officials have been unable to trace the owner of the 3 series saloon, abandoned three months ago in Chester. Cheshire West and Chester Council has now conceded that the car should be classed as 'abandoned' and fixed a notice to it stating that it will be crushed if the owner does not claim it within seven days. Scroll down for video . Grass has started growing out of the bonnet of the black BMW 320i after it was abandoned in Chester . The 2004 manual BMW, that would cost around £23,000 to buy brand new, was abandoned beneath the historic City Walls opposite Albion Place in Chester in October 2014. The mileage of the vehicle is unknown but it is still believed to be worth around £2,000. It has become a talking point among neighbours and regulars at the Albion Inn with a number of theories about the mystery car doing the rounds. At least three parking tickets have been slapped on the car's windscreen over recent months. Courtesy of YouTube - elnegro1979 . The vehicle, parked haphazardly over two bays, is fully taxed, insured and MOT'd . The grass can be seen emerging from under the bonnet of the abandoned vehicle . A council spokesman said: 'We've tried every avenue to contact the owner and it's now classed as abandoned. 'The problem was it was fully taxed, insured and MoT'd so there was nothing wrong with it. 'So we had a duty, working with the police, to make every effort to locate the individual before any action could be taken. 'There was a lot going on behind the scenes. We still do not know what has happened to the owner.' News of the destruction notice on the four door car - parked haphazardly across two bays - has been welcomed in the area. Clare Churchill, chef at the Albion Inn, said: 'It's certainly been a talking point among our regulars. There have been plenty of theories about why it was abandoned. It's a bit of an eyesore and we'll be happy to see it go.' The BMW is set to be crushed in seven days after attempts to trace the owner have drawn a blank .

"A Good Samaritan who stopped a nurse being harassed on a train suffered a heart attack as he left the station - and was saved after she gave him emergency treatment. Grandfather-of-four Stephen Breed, 65, stepped in after he saw Polly Collins, 43, being shouted at and abused by a stranger on the Tube. Mr Breed, who had never met the registered nurse before, waded-in and told the man to go away and he quickly left her alone. Hero Stephen Breed, 65, suffered a heart attack moments after going to the aid of Polly Collins. The 43-year-old registered nurse was able to return the favour and save his life . Miss Collins and Mr Breed then got off at the same Underground station but because of the stress he suffered a heart attack and slumped to the floor minutes later. But incredibly the nurse saw him as she left the station and immediately gave him emergency treatment including CPR - saving his life. Retired warehouse manager Mr Breed, a dad-of-two, said: 'It's funny isn't it. She saved my life. 'She was on the phone texting and when we pulled into the station this man got aggressive about its noise and got in her face. This guy was awful, so rude. 'I had a go and then he got in my face - I can look after myself but I was a bit intimidated and my heart was racing a bit. 'But it all got sorted and then my stop came. I got off the train, and 30 seconds later that was it - good night Vienna.' Polly Collins, pictured above, has been branded a 'superwoman,' but claims she was just doing her job . But modest Miss Collins, of Grimbsy, Lincolnshire, said: 'I was just carrying out the duty of care, being a registered nurse, and anybody would do the same. 'At the end of the day, this guy was quite remarkable himself. He defended me in such a manner and it turns out he was the one that needed defending. 'It could have been such a sad story, but thankfully it turned out brilliantly. I was just pleased, and praise the Lord, that he survived. Miss Collins was heralded Nurse of the Week by her employers for her efforts . 'Had he not, I would have had to live with it for the rest of my life, because he didn't need to do what he did.' Miss Collins started being abused by the stranger on her way to work at nearby Hillingdon Hospital but the man was quickly confronted by Mr Breed. After calming the situation he got off the tube but as he walked ten metres from the train he dropped down with a heart attack and technically 'died' three times. Miss Collins then spotted her own hero lying on the floor at the turnstiles while his wife Masdalina, 62, screamed for help. She quickly grabbed the station's defibrillator and resuscitated the grandfather following the incident on Saturday. Mr Breed, pictured with his family, is recovering from the heart attack in Harefield Hospital . Miss Collins preformed CPR on him until ambulance crews arrived at Uxbridge station, in Hillingdon, north west London. Paramedics took Mr Breed to heart specialists at Harefield Hospital where he was operated on, receiving a stent, and was discharged on Tuesday. His daughter Sarah, 42, of Queen's Park, north west London, said: 'They are both heroes but she is a much greater one. 'She turned into superwoman at that moment. I couldn't be more thankful to her.' Mr Breed collapsed from the stress as he was leaving Uxbridge Station, pictured above, in Hillingdon, north west London . Miss Collins has since been heralded 'Nurse of the Week' by her employers, Thornbury Nursing Services, for saving Mr Breed. The grandmother-of-two  said: 'They've nominated me for nurse of the week - it's great. 'I think you just get some Marks and Spencer vouchers - but it's great to have a little bit of recognition. 'I didn't do it for that though, I only did what anybody would do.' Doctors told Stephen that his heart stopped three times after he collapsed, meaning he technically 'died' three times. tish Transport Police are now looking for the man who abused the nurse on the busy train shortly before 12pm on Saturday.","Grandfather Stephen Breed, 65, stepped in to help the nurse on the tube .

"A new band designed to prevent shark attacks on surfers and swimmers is surfacing this weekend, with endorsements from survivors of such traumatic experiences endorsing the new technology. Created by American Nathan Garrison in partnership with his father David, Sharkbanz is already available stateside, while the Australian launch will take place in Melbourne this weekend. Using electromagnetic currents to deter sharks from an area, the band – which is about the size of a watch – has been tested on nearly a dozen species of sharks so far and aims to ensure that humans and sharks can enjoy the ocean together without danger. Scroll down for video . A new device called Sharkbanz is launching in Australia this weekend, aiming to make the ocean a safer place . Shark attack survivor Paddy Trumbull, 65, who had her buttocks torn off by a bull shark in Queensland in February 2010 said such a device would have 'absolutely' prevented her attack. Mrs Trumbull was swimming out to a boat which had taken she and three other couples snorkelling off Dent Island in the Whitsundays when she felt an 'almighty grab'. 'It was part of the way back to the boat I felt this almighty grab … and I knew immediately without even looking back that it was a shark,' Mrs Trumbull told Daily Mail Australia. 'I turned around and faced this shark and he had the top of his teeth on my back and the bottom of his teeth on my thighs. The wristband has been backed by shark attack survivors who say the technology would have prevented their injuries entirely . Shark attack survivor Paddy Trumbull was taken to hospital after she was bitten by a shark while snorkelling . Mrs Trumbull believes the shark proof wristband could have prevented her from being attacked back in 2010 . After being shaken 'like a ragdoll' a dragged underwater Mrs Trumbull, still fighting the creature by punching and poking it was finally released. 'The shark let me go and I remember feeling the shark rip my flesh and the stinger suit from my body.' Despite this horrific experience the 65-year-old said she wishes no harm on the marine creatures, instead saying the Sharkbanz will allow her to once again harmoniously share the ocean with sharks. 'I'm very anti-culling and I have a fascination with sharks', she said before adding that doesn't mean she isn't apprehensive to enter the ocean after her experience. Mrs Trumbull said there was 'no question' the Sharkbanz would mean she would spend much more time in the water. 'It would really really help me.' Mrs Trumbull (right) who had her buttocks torn off by a bull shark in Queensland in 2010, with husband Chris . With Plastic Surgeon Dr Steven Liew (right) showing a model of how he was going to do the deconstruction . The device's co-founder Nathan said the inspiration for the Sharkbanz came from a life spent on the water and a number of traumatic experiences of his own. 'I grew up on the ocean my whole life on the east coast of the USA … I had my first real experience with sharks when I was 15 when my best friend got bitten by one which tore up his foot,' Nathan told Daily Mail Australia. He said as an avid surfer and diver he'd had many close calls since his teenage years which prompted him to think about what could make the experience safer for everyone. 'A lot of surfers can attest to being out there in the ocean and feeling an eerie feeling and just being watched by something, especially in murky water,' said Nathan. 'It's just really hair-raising and I just wanted to have something that could help protect people', he said before adding that the Sharkbanz in no way harms sharks. Mrs Trumbull pictured with her husband Chris and their youngest son Nick - three months ago . Mrs Trumbull pictured with her nieces Juliet and Nadia celebrating her 65th birthday in August last year . Akin to shining a light in the shark's eyes, the device sends out a signal to let the creatures know that humans aren't food . Aimed at warding off common 'hit and run' attacked by many shark species, the technology has been tested on the most predatory species including bull sharks, blacktips, lemon sharks and tiger sharks. Akin to shining a light in the shark's eyes, the device sends out a signal to let the creatures know that humans aren't food. Similar products currently on the market sell for upwards of $300, while the Sharkbanz is only $84. 'I wanted to make something that combined affordability, simplicity and stylishness,' Nathan said. 'I'd love to see people adopt the product and see a reduction in those kind of attacks.' 'A lot of it is about getting people back in the water who are scared in light of recent attacks,' he added. 'I want people to enjoy how glorious and wonderful the ocean is.'

"The internet went into overdrive when Justin Bieber and Lara Stone were revealed as the new Calvin Klein campaign stars. A few tweeters were, however, convinced that the pop star had a little help to make his muscles look more defined, with one tweeting: 'They airbrushed Justin Bieber to the high heavens!' Despite his naysayers, the Believe singer has revealed that he worked extremely hard to whip his body into shape for his latest gig. Scroll down for video . Airbrushed? Twitter came alive with chatter of Photoshopping after the launch of Justin Bieber's Calvin Klein campaign but the singer claims he worked out five teams a week with a personal trainer ahead of the shoot . The 20-year-old singer claims that he exercised intensely with his trainer. He said: 'I work out with my trainer, Patrick Nilsson, five days a week for about 45 minutes each. 'We do three-days splits: back and triceps one day, chest and biceps on day two, shoulder and legs on day three, and abs every other day. 'I'm not on a special diet, but I do try to watch what I eat. I do eat unhealthy sometimes - I am a 20-year-old guy!' Tweeters pointed out that Justin's abs seem slightly more defined in the campaign shots compared to a softer appearance in the video co-starring Lara Stone. Another user tweeted: 'They airbrushed a lot of muscle onto little Justin Bieber.' MailOnline has contacted Calvin Klein for comment. How did he do it? Justin says he works out five days a week for about 45 minutes each to achieve his toned look for the Calvin Klein campaign . Justin's abs look more ripped in the campaign shots, left, compared to a grab from the shoot video, according to critics on social media . Justin is known for working out a lot and has gradually built up his muscle with bodybuilding over the years. The singer is so committed to working out that he has even been seen in the gym while recovering from a broken foot. In a video posted online, Justin can be seen walking into a weights room with crutches before putting them aside to do some pull ups. Lara Stone, meanwhile, has publicly documented her road to her post-pregnancy body. Comments: Twitter came alive with speculation over the young popstar's muscles . The 31-year-old recently revealed that her pregnancy - and the months afterwards - were less about 'earth mother' perfection and more about bloating, limp hair and self-criticism. She admits that she developed a love of fried food and that it took her a while to slip back into her pre-pregnancy jeans. But the supermodel, who gave birth to her first child - Alfred - with David Walliams in May 2013, worked hard to shift her post-baby pounds and shows off the fruits of her labour in the new shoot. Lara works out with Clean & Lean guru, James Duigan, who developed a 'super gentle' routine for her to follow. Co-star: Model Lara Stone has been working out with James Duigan to get back in shape after having a baby . The programme, which they shared on Net-a-Porter, involves five key moves, designed to provide all-over toning and fat burning specifically for those who haven't exercised for some time such as new mums. The first exercise involves keeping your feet on the floor with your toes up - which engages your glutes - before slowly raising your hips and squeezing your buttocks. This simple move is repeated about 10 times. 'They are so easy to do anywhere like in a hotel,' Lara says. James claims the next move, The Superman, is the 'supermodel secret to a flat tummy'. It involves kneeling on a mat on all fours before extending and retracting the opposite leg and arm simultaneously. Other key moves involve the basic squat while inhaling on the way down and exhaling on the way up, and leg lifts using a resistance band round the knees to add resistance. The final move the power pair love is the 'non-surgical boob lift', which involves going into a half-squatting position and holding that while fully extending the arms outwards and upwards. 'This really engages all the muscles that are going to lift up your chest,' James explains. Lara works out with Clean & Lean guru, James Duigan, pictured left, who developed a 'super gentle' routine . Foodwise, James gives Lara healthy meal plans with dishes such as sesame-crusted chicken with avocado and spinach salad and clean and lean oat pancakes. The key to James’ philosophy is to eat clean foods (as close to their natural state as possible), cut back on CRAP (caffeine, refined sugar, alcohol and processed foods), eat lots of good fats (nuts, avocados, oily fish) and limit bad fats (bacon fat, pies, processed meats etc). James says: ‘If it didn’t once fly, swim or walk, or wasn’t pulled from the ground, from a bush or a plant, don’t eat it! And you don’t have to get this right 100 per cent of the time. If you aim for 80 per cent, you’ll be okay.’ The new Calvin Klein images were shot by fashion photographers Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott in New York City. The campaign continues the brand's association with music and pop culture, which began with the famous shots of Marky Mark (Wahlberg) and Kate Moss back in the Nineties. 'Given my on-going relationship with the house, this shoot reunited me with my Calvin Klein family -and it was really fun working with Justin,' said Stone. 'We had a great time on set and we had a lot of fun shooting the campaign. I think the shoot really captured the energy of the Calvin Klein brand.' The key to James Duigan’s Clean & Lean philosophy is to eat clean foods (as close to their natural state as possible). Nourishing Smoothie .

"The annual Pimm’s wars have begun, with supermarkets under-cutting each other on the popular summer drink. Get in there quick at Tesco, where it’s £12 for a litre bottle until the end of today, or go to Asda where it’s £9 for a 70cl bottle (which works out at £12.86 a litre). At Morrisons it is £15 a litre and at Ocado it is £18, but you get a £5 jug free. Scroll down for video . The annual Pimm’s war has begun, with supermarkets under-cutting each other on the popular drink, you can snap up a taste of summer for £5.99 with Aldi's Austin's 70cl (left) and Sainsbury's Pitchers is £12 for 1 litre (right) Or why not try one of the alternatives? There are drinks made specifically by the supermarkets to compete with Pimm’s at a lower price — or to offer a more upmarket version. They are all gin-based, like Pimm’s, with added sugar and fruity flavours, though the alcohol content varies and some taste better than others. I had the onerous task of blind-testing some in the sunshine at the weekend (made up to the same proportions of alcohol, lemonade and fruit). It’s a tough job . . . Austin’s from Aldi . £5.99, 70cl (£8.56 per litre) You could tell the difference between this and Pimm’s only if you tasted them side-by-side — made up in a jug with lemonade and fruit, I am sure that no one would twig that you’d used a cheap version. Austin’s is slightly more citrussy and less sweet, and at 21.9 per cent alcohol against Pimm’s 25 per cent it is also less alcoholic. The bottle is quite a naughty copy — there’s even a signature scrawled on the lid just as there is with Pimm’s. VERDICT: By the time you’ve added lemonade, a sprig of mint and loads of fruit, your guests will never know. SCORE: 4/5 . Summer in a cup: Pimm's is usually served with a selection of fresh fruit including strawberries, cucumber, mint and orange . Pitchers from Sainsbury’s . £12, 1 litre . A few years ago, Diageo, which makes Pimm’s, tried to sue Sainsbury’s over this copy (they ended up with just a few minor label changes), and I can see why. It tastes so similar it’s incredible! It’s got the same amount of alcohol as Pimm’s, but there is a slightly stronger orange tang in Pitchers, and — at a push — I would say it’s sweeter, with less herbaceous notes. However, they’ve done incredibly well at making a near- perfect version. VERDICT: Hide the bottle and make up a pitcher . . . SCORE: 5/5 . Jeeves from Lidl . £5.99, 70cl  (£8.56 per litre) My immediate reaction to this drink was it seemed less potent than Pimm’s, and indeed it is, with 17.5  per cent alcohol. Also, it doesn’t have any of Pimm’s bitter, complex flavours that make it such a clever drink. It just tastes like a sweet — and refreshing, mind — alcopop. Perfectly acceptable for some, just not quite the same as Pimm’s. VERDICT: Sweet and summery drink — good for those who really don’t like the taste of alcohol, but not my cup of Pimm’s. SCORE: 3/5 . Worthy contenders: Jeeves from Lidl is just £5.99 for 70cl (left) while Heston from Waitrose (right) is £21.35 for the same quantity . Heston from Waitrose . Fruit Cup, £21.35, 70cl  (£30.50 a litre) Ideally you’d make this up with ginger ale and a sprig of rosemary, as Heston suggests, but I wanted to keep this test consistent (and I didn’t have any ginger ale to hand). It’s nothing like Pimm’s in taste or look — why on earth would Heston try to copy anyone — but it is rather lovely nonetheless, with flavours of red berries and blackcurrants, and interesting back notes of Earl Grey tea. VERDICT: It’s pricey but makes an excellent alternative to Pimm’s. SCORE: 4/5 . Sipsmith from Ocado or Waitrose . £15, 50cl (£30 a litre) I was excited to try this as I love Sipsmith gin, and the bottle is beautiful, but it’s very alcoholic — 29 per cent — and tastes herbaceous rather than fruity. For me, it needs to be far more diluted than a Pimm’s — more like a G&T. I far preferred it with tonic water and a squeeze of lemon. VERDICT: Better for a fruity, evening G&T than a lunchtime Pimm’s-a-like. SCORE: 3/5 . Pimm’s Blackberry and Elderflower . £9, 70cl at Asda; £12,  1 litre at Tesco (until today), Waitrose . This Pimm’s special edition sounds appealing — how can anyone not like blackberries or elderflower? But it tastes just like cola cube sweets to me — sweet, with no bitter or herb notes, and no redeeming features. VERDICT: Yuck! Is this aimed at children? SCORE: 0/5 . Bringing up the rear: Sipsmith Summer Cup (left) is a traditional take on the original and is available for £15 for 50cl at Ocado. Pimm's has brought out a special edition blackberry and elderflower flavour for the summer £9 for 70cl at Asda and £12 for 1 litre at Tesco (right) Gail’s Russian Rye Sourdough . £3 for 500g, Ocado . You’d be hard-pushed to find bread better than Gail’s and this is my favourite, made from a  15-year-old wild yeast starter, and allowed to rise naturally to produce a complex, delicious loaf. Heston from Waitrose  Pork &  picCalilli  pie  280g . £2.69, Waitrose . You can’t have a picnic without a pork pie. And you can’t have a pork pie without piccalilli. Trust Heston to combine the two in this sensational,  flaky-pastry pie. Belvoir raspberry lemonade . Around £2.29 for 750ml, widely available . Made from pressed raspberries, lemon juice, sparkling water and sugar, this stunning-looking pink lemonade tastes as wonderful as it looks. Waitrose mojito chicken cigarillos . 110g, £2.69 . It’s three for £6 on Waitrose picnic products until July 15, including these delicious filo ‘cigars’ filled with minced chicken mixed with rum, mint and lime. Belvoir raspberry lemonade (left) is made from pressed raspberries, lemon juice, sparkling water and sugar and is a wonderful accompaniment to any picnic. Waitrose chicken cigarillos (right) are on offer until July 15 . Tesco blue & red striped drinks bucket . £10 . Keep your drinks cool in this fabulous retro bucket — it goes with the deckchair, left. Asda Little Angels Soft Fruity Hand & Face Wipes . 30 pack for 77p . If you’re having a picnic you need a pack of wipes and these are cheap, hypoallergenic, smell lovely and are suitable for the whole family. Asda Extra Special Smoked Salmon With Cider . 120g, £5 or  two for £8 . I love Asda’s Extra Special smoked salmon — it’s carved into lovely thin pieces and well-priced. This is also good, and has an interesting flavour. Epicurean Sorrento Picnic rug . £14.99, Ocado .

Asda Little Angels Soft Fruity Hand & Face Wipes (left) are great for mopping up and smell lovely, while the Epicurean Sorrento Picnic rug (right) will keep clothes dry to from any damp ground and looks very stylish .

"Police are hunting for two men who tried to buy a toddler from his mother for $100 at a California supermarket. Police said the unidentified woman, 34, was in the check out at a Baja Ranch Market in Covina at about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday when they were approached by at man. After giving mother and son several compliments, he asked if she would sell him the boy. These two unidentified men are believed to have attempted to buy a woman's boy for $100 at a California supermarket . She refused the bizarre request, but he continued telling the boy he was very beautiful, NBC Los Angeles reports. The woman tried to wait in the store's lobby until the man was gone and she believed it was safe to go, but upon heading to her car he drove over in a champagne-colored Honda Pilot. Another unidentified man was in the passenger seat. ''Oh look, it’s you! It’s both of you. You’re so beautiful,'' she told police he complimented her again. She demanded they leave her alone, but the man who complimented her got out of the vehicle, pulled a $100 out and asked to purchase the boy. Police said the unidentified woman, 34, was in the check out at a Baja Ranch Market in Covina at about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday when they were approached by at man . She thought they would kidnap the boy but instead dropped the cash in her shopping cart, told her to keep it, then drove away. The pair are said to be a 5'8'' 45-year-old weighing roughly 200 pounds in blue jeans and a brown button down. The other was in his 50s, about 6-feet-tall and 215 pounds in a white shirt and tan pants. Store surveillance footage has been released to help identify them.

"Police have clocked 22,000 speeding drivers through a village in just 16 days. Officers had told villagers armed with a speed gun to stop clocking drivers breaking the law in Ticknall, Derbyshire - because they couldn't cope with the paperwork. But after stepping in to conduct their own speed survey, police found that more than one in six motorists - 22,114 out of 118,107 - were breaking the 30mph limit. Police have clocked 22,000 speeding drivers through the village of Ticknall, Derbyshire, in just 16 days . Residents in the village used speed gun to catch drivers who break the 30mph limit on the A514, who were then sent warning letters from the force saying they have breached the limit and risk prosecution if they did again. Campaigner Kevin Harris welcomed the figures released by Derbyshire Police's Casualty Reduction Enforcement Support Team (CREST). He said: 'I will be attending Derbyshire County Council's Cabinet meeting later this month with our member Linda Chilton, to put questions to them about highways. 'These figures complement our figures. The figures have not surprised us because we live on this road so we know what it is like.' The villagers were given the gun by officers to catch speeding motorists who break the 30mph limit through their village. But they were so proficient with their speed gun that it was taken off them. They carried out 10 speeding operations on the A514 main road through the village clocking a total of around 200 motorists. Over a 16-day period, from December 3 to 18, CREST undertook a speed survey on the A514 Main Street, Ticknall. Officers had told villagers armed with a speed gun to stop clocking drivers breaking the law - because they couldn't cope with the paperwork . The survey consisted of two rubber tubes being fixed across the road and connected to a survey counter that collected data including traffic flow and speed of traffic. Members from the CREST team were quick to point out that this is not a 'method of speed enforcement' but is used for data collection purposes. For the entire 16-day period, 118,107 were tracked using the road. A total of 17,399 vehicles (or 14.7 per cent) were travelling at a speed greater than 36mph. An additional of 4,715 vehicles (or four per cent) were travelling above 40mph. Mr Harris added: 'We haven't done our speedwatch for a while and you can see that speeds are going up again. 'We want to know what can be done. They say they cannot do an Operation Safedrive because there is nowhere to pull vehicles over and we only have one PCSO for the area. But after stepping in to conduct their own speed survey, police found that more than one in six motorists - 22,114 out of 118,107 - were breaking the 30mph limit through the picturesque village . 'We will definitely keep doing our speedwatch.' Mr Harris and his volunteers recently made national headlines after they were told to scale down the amount of times they conduct their speedwatch sessions as it was creating too much paperwork for police. He added: 'I feel people are listening but we are not getting the right answers because everyone is saying 'we can't (do this)' because of lack of resources.' A spokesman for Derbyshire Police responded to claims made by Mr Harris. He said: 'We appreciate Mr Harris' concerns about the speeding in Ticknall. 'The Derby and Derbyshire Road Safety Partnership will be looking at ways to tackle the speeding in this area. No decisions have been made yet about the best approach to take.'","Officers in Ticknall clocked 22,114 out of 118,107 breaking 30mph limit .

"As awards season approaches, many of Hollywood's biggest names are being honored for their exemplary work in film - and a few for their drastic body transformations. Every year seems to bring at least one example of an A-list actor who has bulked up or toned down in the name of their art, and many of these actors are rewarded for their efforts with accolades and awards. This year, Jake Gyllenhaal got rail thin for his role in Nightcrawler before packing on the pounds thanks to twice a day workouts to play a boxer in the upcoming Southpaw while Jennifer Aniston softened up her taut and toned physique for her role in Cake. And now, both actors have been nominated for a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards - and Oscar nominations seem inevitable. Scroll down for videos . Jake Gyllenhaal lost weight for his role in Nightcrawler (left), then immediately packed it on after filming was complete to play a boxer in Southpaw (right) Matthew McConaughey put on some muscle to play a stripper in Magic Mike (left) and then lost it to plays an AIDs patient in Dallas Buyers Club (right) Chris Pratt toned up (right) for his roles in the action films Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World . Robert De Niro was one of the first actors to garner notice for his drastic weight change for a film, bulking up to play boxer Joe LaMotta in the film Raging Bull. The actor bulked up for the film's boxing scenes, and then gained 60 pounds to portray LaMotta later in life, which at the time was the most an actor had ever gained for a role. His reward was a Best Actor Oscar. Gaining the weight is no doubt a breeze when compared to losing it, something Christian Bale took to an extreme while filming The Machinist back in 2004. Bale lost 60 pounds by eating nothing but a can of tuna and an apple every day. Christian Bale tends to go to extremes with his weight, losing over 60 pounds (left) for The Machinist, and then piling on 100 to play Batman (right) Bale put on even more weight to his normally svelte figure (left) for the film American Hustle (right) Robert De Niro would go on to add muscle (center), and then 60 pounds of weight (right) for his role in Raging Bull, a departure from his normal tiny frame (left) Russell Crowe packed on the pounds to play Jeffrey Wigand (right), the man who blew the whistle on the tobacco industry, then got cut to star in Gladiator (left) Matt Damon dropped weight for his role in Courage Under Fire by eating nothing but chicken breasts (left) and later gained weight for The Informant (right) What's even more astonishing is the fact that the director did not even ask Bale to lose the weight for the role. Immediately after he finished filming, Bale then bulked up, putting on over 100 pounds to play Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins. He would go on to drop substantial weight for The Fighter and put on substantial weight for American Hustle in the years to follow. For this he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fighter. Bradley Cooper put lots of muscle on his frame (left) for his role in the film American Sniper . George Clooney got fit and toned for The American (left) and then put on weight for Syriana (right) Jared Leto gained almost 70 pounds for Chapter 27 (left) and lost 30 for Dallas Buyer's Club (right) Matthew Foc was already in shape (right) before his role in Alex Cross, but got extra bulked up (left) Jared Leto is another performer who is not afraid to change his body for a role, gaining 67 pounds to play Mark David Chapman, the man who killed John Lennojn, in the film Chapter 27, and losing 30 pounds to play Rayon in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club. Leto's Dallas costar Matthew McConaughey also dropped weight, and both men, like Bale and De Niro, took home Oscars. These transformations are not just for the men either, with Charlize Theron packing on the pounds to play Aileen Wurnos in the film Monster and Renee Zellweger doing the same for her title role in Bridget Jones' Diary. Renee Zellweger packed on the pounds to play Bridget Jones (left), and then shed them all and more to star as Roxie Hart in Chicago (right) Charlize Theron gained weight to play a serial killer in Monster (left) and won an Oscar for her transformation . Toni Collette gained weight for her film debut in Muriel's Wedding (left), and then again for her role in In Her Shoes (center) Channing Tatum bulked up from his appearance in Step Up (left) to play s tripper in Magic Mike (center) and a wrestler in Foxcatcher (right) Both women were nominated for Oscars, but only Theron won. And it's not just Aniston and Gyllenhaal who have shape-shifted this year, with Bradley Copper also bulking up big time for his role in American Sniper. All three are no doubt hoping they have the same luck as George Clooney, who took home an Oscar for his role in Syriana, which required a 35 pound weight gain. Less successful was Russel Crowe, who was nominated after gaining weight for his role in The Insider, then again for getting toned in Gladiator, but ultimately won for the role that required no body transformation at all in A Beautiful Mind. Toni Collette is one of the few actor;'s to have gained weight on multiple occasions, first for her debut riole in Muriel's Wedding and later for the 2005 film In Her Shoes. The actor has said in recent interviews however that her days of gaining a substantial amount of weight for a role are over.","These Hollywood stars lost a staggering amount of weight, or did everything they could to pack on the pounds, for movie roles .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin oversees a country with an astounding 18million people living beneath the poverty line. But it has emerged he can now toast his own success on the international stage - after planting a vineyard in the grounds of a stunning Spanish mansion he has reportedly bought and developed for some £15million. Putin’s grand home near Marbella is in the Malaga province of Benahavis and comes complete with stunning northern views of the Serrania de Ronda mountain range. Vladimir Putin’s grand home is on the exclusive La Zagaleta estate in the Malaga province of Benahavis (pictured) and boasts a private helipad and garage capable of housing more than 22 vehicles. He has planted the top Burgos-based Bodega 'Pingus', with single vintage bottles of the wine costing in excess of £750 . Meanwhile, to the south the wealthy Russian leader can enjoy an unspoilt Andalusian outlook across the Mediterranean sea towards both Gibraltar and the coast of North Africa. Putin – who has always revelled in his hard-man bare chested ‘hunter’ image – has clearly now decided he might enjoy the finer things in life. For the Daily Mail has learned that the 62-year-old insisted on 25 vines from the top Burgos-based Bodega ‘Pingus’ – some 500 miles from the Costa del Sol - to be planted into a series of sun-soaked terraces surrounding his new mansion high in the Marbella Hills. The Russian president, 62, will have the wine he produces stored in acclimatised cellars costing an estimated £750,000 to install. Above, Putin at a cathedral in the village of Otradnoye, Voronezh region, Russia on Wednesday - the day Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas in accordance with the Julian calendar . The Russian President is understood to have hired the famous Valladolid province vineyard owner – Danish oenologist Peter Sisseck – to oversee both the production of the grapes and the later bottling process. Putin's mansion is set on a plot of land totalling more than 18,000 square metres . Pingus is described as a ‘cult wine’ which can be sold at extremely high prices after the vines are cultivated without the use of either fertiliser or pesticides. Single vintage bottles can demand prices in excess of £750. Following a carefully controlled harvest, Putin’s version of the wine is set to be produced in two huge underground cellars at the ten-bedroom mansion he bought two years ago and which has since seen vast redevelopment. Putin’s grand home is on the exclusive and gated La Zagaleta estate and boasts a private helipad and garage capable of housing more than 22 vehicles. The wine he will produce would be stored in French oak barrels within two specially acclimatised cellars which cost an estimated £750,000 to install. More than two years ago it was revealed that former KGB boss Putin was linked to a consortium of six wealthy businessmen helping to back and fund the wealthy Club de Campo La Zagaleta project. President Putin’s Spanish home is just a forty minute drive to the newly refurbished Malaga airport which now offers direct flights to Moscow. The extravagant residential estate has a plot of land totalling more than 18,000 square metres and is 400 metres above sea level and less than eight miles from the Costa beaches. The ‘Club’ environment – including homes owned by the former Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov and a nearby property belonging to Rod Stewart – boasts a spa, two golf courses, a cinema, piano bar and a number of swimming pools. As 18million Russians live below the poverty line - a staggering 13 per cent of the population - it remains unclear what they think about Putin's fine wine project (file picture) The development also boasts several lounges, a billiard room, bowling alley and a function room for private events or discos. Members of the club can also take part in enjoying hiking and cycling trails on the development. Promotional material for the development tells of members and their guests being offered a ‘high level of security, privacy and exclusivity’ with visitors enjoying luxury surroundings including the ‘mild climate of Southern Spain, the beach and the contrast of the mountainous landscape.’ The developers of the site have also lived by the mantra ‘only the best is good enough’. But just what 18million poverty stricken Russians – a staggering 13 per cent of the population – think about Putin’s fine wine project remains unclear.

"Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara masterminded his first victory over former club Celtic as a 2-1 Tannadice win fired the Tangerines back into the Scottish Premiership title race. Celtic were going for nine league wins in a row but goals from Nadir Ciftci and Stuart Armstrong moved United up to second, just four points behind the leaders. Stefan Scepovic had a goal wrongly disallowed for the visitors late on before fellow substitute Leigh Griffiths pulled one back. The former Hibernian striker also hit the post in injury time but United held on for their first win against the Glasgow giants since May 2012 as they became just the third side after Hamilton and Inverness to beat Ronny Deila's team in league action this term. Dundee United's Calum Butcher celebrates with teammates after his side's 2-1 victory over Celtic . United started without Paul Paton as the midfielder started the first of his controversial two-match ban for spitting at Jonny Hayes - a punishment issued despite the Aberdeen man backing Paton's claim he had done no wrong. The standard for a frenetic encounter was set after just 30 seconds when Ciftci was booked for clattering into Scott Brown, and the hosts went ahead after four minutes. Sean Dillon was allowed to attack down the right before cutting the ball inside for Armstrong. The United playmaker tried to find Ciftci but saw Nir Bitton divert his pass into the box, while Efe Ambrose swiped at fresh air to put Celtic in trouble. Ciftci had continued his run and made the most of the Nigerian's blunder as he turned and fired past the helpless Craig Gordon. Celtic upped the tempo further but first they saw Callum Morris make a goal-saving interception after Stefan Johansen knocked a header down for John Guidetti, and were then denied by Rado Cierzniak as the Polish stopper raced from his line to block at Johansen's feet. United were dangerous on the break though and Gordon denied them a second goal with a great one-handed stop from Conor Townsend's drive. Stuart Armstong heads the ball past Celtic keeper Craig Gordon  to double Dundee United's lead . Celtic claimed for a penalty on the half-hour mark after Dillon barged into Guidetti but referee Stevie McLean ruled it a fair challenge. Bitton then hit the crossbar just before the break - but the Israeli did not know much about it. Johansen's near-post corner was punched by Cierzniak onto Bitton's head and it ricocheted onto the woodwork. Virgil van Dijk followed up but Dillon was well placed to clear off the line. The crossbar rattled again eight minutes into the second half. Johansen showed his bravery as he won the ball in midfield before sweeping it out left to Anthony Stokes. The Irishman's cross was poor but Dillon could only watch with horror as his miscue bounced up against the frame of the goal before James Forrest put the rebound into the side-netting. Deila hoped to gee up his attack as he replaced Stokes and Guidetti with Scepovic and Kris Commons after an hour. But five minutes later it was United celebrating again. Emilio Izaguirre allowed Ciftci to collect Dillon's throw down in the right corner and did nothing to prevent the Turk rolling into the box. Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara masterminded his first victory over his former club . There did not appear to be much on but the United striker stood up a magnificent cross to the far post where Armstrong lay unmarked to squeeze home a header. Commons hit a weak effort straight at Cierzniak while Scepovic saw his close-range strike wrongly ruled out. Izaguirre had chested the ball down for the Serbian from Johansen's cross-field pass but television replays showed Blair Spittal was playing Scepovic onside as he turned the ball home. United nearly had a third as Izaguirre had to block Chris Erskine's header from underneath his own crossbar. Griffiths, who had replaced Bitton, gave Celtic hope as he poked through Cierzniak's legs from Scepovic's pass before smashing a 20-yard strike against the base of the post in stoppage time as United held on.","Nadir Ciftci and Stuart Armstrong scored to give Dundee United victory .

"Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling was not one of the four players to be voted into baseball's Hall of Fame this year, and the World Series champ is speaking out as to why he believes he did not make the cut. Schilling, who over his 20 year career notched 216 wins - three of which came during World Series play - is claiming that his politics are keeping him from being admitted into his sport's most hallowed hall. 'I know that as a Republican that there’s some people that really don’t like that,' said Schilling. Scroll down for video . Not in: Curt Schilling (above) was not one of the four players inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame this year, which he believes is a result of his politics . Legends: Pitchers Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez (above) and John Smoltz did make the cut, alongside Houston Astros infielder Craig Biggio . The right-hander revealed this during an interview with WEEI after it was announced that three pitchers were among the four players who would be inducted into the Hall of Fame this year. Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and John Smoltz were the hurlers to make the cut, alongside Houston Astros infielder Craig Biggio. As for Schilling, he thinks that his support of President George Bush, who he actively campaigned for in 2004, has alienated many of the Hall of Fame voters. 'I don’t think that it kept me out or anything like that, but I do know there are guys who probably will never vote for me because of the things I said or did,' he said. 'That’s the way it works.' That being said, new inductee Smoltz, who Schilling claims is a Democrat, did donate to Mitt Romney's campaign during his 2012 run for the presidency. Waiting: Players who just missed the cut this year include Roger Clemens (above), Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Barry Bond . The Baseball Writers' Association of America votes on who will be admitted to the Hall of Fame each year, with a player needing to appear on 75 percent of the ballots to make the cut. A player becomes eligible for the honor five years after retiring, and can only appear on the ballot for 10 years. This year was Schilling's third, and he appeared on 39.2 percent of the ballots. Other players who just missed the cut include Roger Clemens, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds. Schilling, who began his career with the Philadelphia Phillies, is best known for his performance in the 2004 American League Championship Series, when he led the Red Sox to a victory over the New York Yankees while pitching on an injured ankle in game six of the seven game series. The Red Sox would go on to win the World Series that year, their first victory in 86 years. Schilling revealed in February 2014 that he was battling oral cancer, but he is currently in remission.","Curt Schilling is speaking out after not being named one of the four baseball players to be inducted into the Hall of Fame this year .

"Wearing protective clothing and armed with riot shields, these officers stand face-to-face with angry mobs throwing petrol bombs, bricks and glass bottles. It may look like a scene of inner city violence, but many of the buildings are nothing but empty shells and the unruly gang is in fact in-character policemen at a fake Kent town. The officers at the Metropolitan Police Specialist Training Centre in Gravesend practice various forms of public disorder and firearm use and training is intended to prepare them for real-life riot situations. Photographer James Rawlings was given unprecedented access to the site after several months of negotiations and documented a scene involving 15 policemen pretending to be a mob - antagonising other officers who were acting as the response unit, slowly dispersing and detaining the gang. Mr Rawlings, who lives in Tottenham, north London, where the 2011 London riots began, was warned that photographing a person's face could put them in danger or single them out when they later came into contact with the public, and had to take pictures from behind or afar. 'The 'mob' aggressively goaded and threatened the officers with physical and verbal missiles - they really took it to a frightening level,' he said. 'There were officers there who'd never experienced this sort of training before, and for them, on street level, I imagine it felt pretty real.'

"They might own vast chateaux, private jets galore and ocean-going super-yachts but all billionaires really want is to be normal. Jacques Peretti, the man behind a new documentary, The Super Rich And Us, says the world's wealthiest put everyday experiences such as a hassle-free walk along the street above amassing a wardrobe of Rolexes or lavish spending sprees. Peretti, whose credits also include The Men Who Made Us Spend,  spent months with the world's wealthiest in a bid to find out what makes them tick. Jacques Peretti directed The Super Rich And Us, a look at the real lives of the world's wealthiest people . 'What's really fascinating is that it's such a closed off world to the rest of us,' he explains. 'The way the world is changing at the moment is moving things very much in their direction. 'The super rich are no longer just of freak interest - they'll be playing a real role in future. What's interesting is because governments are essentially broke, the onus will fall more on the super rich and corporations to do more. The role is being pushed upon them.' In the documentary, which will be screened tonight on BBC2, Peretti meets some of the UK's wealthiest residents, among them Air Asia and Tune Hotels boss, Tony Fernandes. According to Peretti, Mr Fernandes, who is thought to be worth around £650m, doesn't consider himself particularly wealthy. 'It's kind of interesting that the wealthy never see themselves as wealthy,' he explains. 'Not even billionaires see themselves as wealthy because they're always looking to the next person. 'Tony Fernandes, who owns Queens Park Rangers football club as well as Air Asia, told me that he wouldn't call himself rich and that I should look at someone like Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.' Air Asia and Tune Hotels boss Tony Fernandes might be worth £650m but he'd rather eat baked beans . Wealthy Russians such as Roman Abramovich place a high value on  London's safety and tolerance . Bezos is worth an estimated $29.7bn making him wealthier than Fernandes but considerably poorer than Carlos Slim Helú, the Mexican telecoms magnate who, with his $79.6bn fortune, is the world's wealthiest man. Regardless of whether their wealth can be counted in the billions or hundreds of millions, Peretti says the majority have surprisingly simple tastes. 'Billionaires are expected to own things like Lear Jets, super-yachts and so on. But if you speak to very wealthy people, they see that as a bit tacky. 'As Tony Fernandes said to me, ""Why would I want to spend all my time sitting around on a boat in the ocean? It would be boring!""' Instead, says Peretti, what the super rich really want are 'experiences'. 'It's about exclusivity and experiences,' he explains. 'They want things that no-one else can have, like flying to the moon. Bentleys, Rolexes and all that stuff is just blingy and tacky. It's the sort of thing that a footballer would have. 'They all have this impish sense of humour about how people view them,' continues Peretti. 'They can be quite eccentric about not doing the things people expect them to do. 'Tony Fernandes, for instance, likes to go home and have beans on toast.' The same attitude influences their choice of place to live, with many choosing London partly because the city's tolerant attitude allows them to live a normal life. 'A lot are attracted to London because it's multicultural,' explains Peretti. 'One Russian tycoon told me that, ""Here, I can take my kids to school"". 'That wouldn't be possible in Moscow because the risk of being robbed or kidnapped or having your money taken away by the government is all too real. 'For people like him, being normal is an impossible luxury. Billionaires love the idea they can get on the bus if they want.' Amazon 's Jeff Bezos has amassed a $29bn fortune but Peretti says billionaires don't think themselves rich . According to Peretti, the very wealthy value experiences over expensive toys such as super yachts . Roman Abramovich lives on this Kensington street, where prices start at £5m for a simple terraced house . While they might want to get on the bus like the rest of us, the presence of the super-rich has also had an unexpected consequence in the shape of what Peretti calls 'vertical aspiration'. 'In the 1950s, people would keep up with Joneses, with their neighbours. Now, with the super rich, aspirations have gone through the roof. 'You feel that you haven't made it if you don't own a super-yachts or spend winter in Verbier. Because of that, credit card spending has gone through the roof.' Nevertheless, the wealthy, says Peretti, aren't entirely to blame. 'It is not all bad,' he says. 'People paint the super rich as these evil people. They aren't, they're just trying to live their lives.' As normally as possible, it would seem.","A new documentary claims the tastes of the super rich are quite simple .

"A computer program that taught itself to play poker has created nearly the best possible strategy for one version of the game, showing the value of techniques that may prove useful to help decision-making in medicine and other areas. The program considered 24 trillion simulated poker hands per second for two months, probably playing more poker than all humanity has ever experienced, says Michael Bowling, who led the project. The resulting strategy still won't win every game because of bad luck in the cards. But over the long run — thousands of games — it won't lose money. ""We can go against the best (players) in the world and the humans are going to be the ones that lose money,"" said Bowling, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. A computer program that taught itself to play poker has created nearly the best possible strategy for one version of the game, showing the value of techniques that may prove useful for real-world challenges . The strategy applies specifically to a game called heads-up limit Texas Hold 'em. While scientists have created poker-playing programs for years, Bowling's result stands out because it comes so close to ""solving"" its version of the game, which essentially means creating the optimal strategy. Poker is hard to solve because it involves imperfect information, where a player doesn't know everything that has happened in the game he is playing — specifically, what cards the opponent has been dealt. Many real-world challenges like negotiations and auctions also include imperfect information, which is one reason why poker has long been a proving ground for the mathematical approach to decision-making called game theory. Tuomas Sandholm of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who didn't participate in the new work, called Bowling's results a landmark. He said it's the first time that an imperfect-information game that is competitively played by people has been essentially solved. Bowling's paper, released Thursday by the journal Science, introduces some  techniques that could become useful for applying game theory in real-world situations. Bowling is investigating the possibility of helping doctors determine proper insulin doses for diabetic patients, for example. Poker is hard to solve because it involves imperfect information, where a player doesn't know everything that has happened in the game he is playing — specifically, what cards the opponent has been dealt . Game theory has also been used to schedule security patrols, and it has implications for other areas like developing strategies for cybersecurity, designing drugs and fighting disease pandemics. But Bowling doubts the poker strategy will let anybody make a fortune on the game itself. The kind of poker it applies to has waned in popularity over the past seven years or so, he said.  Even online, the stakes tend to be small and ""you'd be winning a few dollars, not raking in millions."" In the two-player game, each contestant creates a poker hand from two cards he is dealt face-down plus five other cards placed on the table face-up. Players place bets before the face-up cards are laid out, and then again as each card is revealed.  The size of the wagers is fixed. Bowling said the computer's strategy is far too complicated for anybody to memorize, with about 1,000 times the amount of information in the English-language Wikipedia. But his university has created a website where people can ask it for advice and even play against it.","The strategy  won't win every game because of bad luck in the cards, but over the long run — thousands of games — it won't lose money .

"When a 911 call from the 11-year-old son of a hiker critically injured after a 150ft fall from a cliff cut out, rescuers had no idea where to start their search. But, thanks to a quick-thinking dispatcher, the father and son were tracked down by a picture they had posted on Facebook from the mountain earlier that day. Ryan Pritchard and his sons Jake and Devon were hiking on a remote mountain trail near Sacramento, California, when the father slipped and fell, suffering a severe head injury. Scroll down for video . Ryan Pritchard fell 150ft off a cliff but, after his 11-year-old son's (pictured with another of Mr Pritchard's sons), 911 call cut out, dispatchers found him thanks to this Facebook picture . Trainee 911 dispatcher Breanna Martinez (right) tracked Mr Pritchard (left) down on Facebook, leading rescuers to the stricken father . Jake, 11, phoned 911 but the signal cut out before he could tell dispatchers where they were. With a race against time before nightfall, the call handlers made desperate attempts to call back and track down the family. The only clue they had was that the call connected with a cellphone tower near Vacaville - which eventually turned out to be more than 30 miles from their actual location near Lake Berryessa. Trainee dispatcher Breanna Martinez used her initiative and started hunting down the father online, finding his LinkedIn page to work out he was from Sacramento. From there, Ms Martinez, from California Highway Patrol, was able to find Mr Pritchard's Facebook page - and a photograph of the family. 'We are both working vigorously on trying to find out who this person is, where this person is at, especially when we don't have a definite location,' said dispatcher Shari Speakman. The Pritchards were walking the Blue Ridge Loop Trail not far from Sacramento, California . Mr Pritchard is now recovering in hospital after suffering a head injury, several fractured bones and broken jaw in the fall . Ms Martinez added: 'I decided to search myself since they were busy, so I plugged the name into Google and his LinkedIn account came up. So I was able to get a picture and know he was from Sacramento. 'I scrolled down and the very first post was a picture of his two sons and behind him was the lake - Lake Berryessa. And it just said 'Hiking the Blue Ridge Trail today.' The miraculous find helped rescue teams pinpoint where the Pritchards were, finding the injured father before sunset on Tuesday. Solano County Sheriff Thomas Ferrara said: 'Being in law enforcement 31 years I don't know that I would have thought of that.' Mr Pritchard's family say he had several fractured bones, a head injury and a broken jaw from the fall, but his son Jake was not hurt. The father is now recovering in hospital.","Ryan Pritchard fell 150ft from a cliff while out hiking with his two sons .

Turkey has become embroiled in terrorism fears since it became the main passage for fighters joining extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. The neighbouring conflicts have the potential to cause instability in Turkey and spill over into some of it's major cities. The Department of Foreign Affairs has previously voiced concerns about the possibility of attacks against targets in Turkey, including Ankara, Istanbul or areas close to the Syrian border.

A national ballot was held to hand-pick the 8000 Australians who were lucky enough to be rewarded the honour . Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Australian National University terrorism expert Clarke Jones said the Anzac Day commemorations in Turkey was a high risk event. 'It is a valuable target and it would be quite strategic for, say, Islamic State to launch something in Turkey. Gallipoli is a fair distance from the border of Syria and Iraq but distance is not big deal if they wanted to do it … especially given the porous border.' While the government's Smartraveller website says that the security environment in Turkey is volatile and may change between now and April 2015, they have urged Australia tourists to plan their trip in advance and be sure to purchase travel insurance. Tight security arrangements will be in place for the commemorations. Turkish authorities will screen all visitors on arrival. All bags will be searched and prohibited items will be confiscated.

"It really was an appy new year for Apple, as the firm revealed today customers spent over half a billion dollars on apps and in app purchases in the first week of January. It also said New Year's Day 2015 marked the single biggest day ever in App Store sales history. Overall, the firm said it has paid out over $25 billion to app developers. New Year's Day 2015 marked the single biggest day ever in App Store sales history . As part of its latest figures, Apple has put a number to the jobs it has created or supported at home: 1.03 million. Applications designed for Apple's smartphones and tablets have helped create more than 627,000 U.S. jobs, while 334,000 jobs have resulted from its spending and growth, and 66,000 people work directly for the company in the U.S. 'Apple ignited the app revolution with the launch of the App Store in 2008,' the company said. 'Since then, an entire industry has been built around app design and development.' The new figures follow a record-breaking 2014, in which billings rose 50 per cent and apps generated over $10 billion in revenue for developers. In just six years, the iOS ecosystem has helped create 627,000 jobs in the US alone, Apple said. 'This year is off to a tremendous start after a record-breaking year for the App Store and our developer community,' said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. 'We're so proud of the creativity and innovation developers bring to the apps they create for iOS users and that the developer community has now earned over $25 billion.' Apple also launched apps for (RED), a special initiative on the store with exclusive content where all proceeds went to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Apple donated a record $20 million this quarter, and since partnering with (RED) has donated over $100 million. One of the hits of 2014 came from Australia's Hipster Whale, creator of the game Crossy Road. 'We could never have dreamed of this level of success, with Crossy Road only being available on the App Store for the last six weeks of the year,' said Matthew Hall, co-founder of Hipster Whale. Apple's app revenue could be boosted by the arrival of the Apple Watch this year . 'In a couple of months we were able to create a simple, fun game that was featured on the App Store and climbed to the top of the App Store charts around the world—it's amazing.' Late last year iTunes announced its biggest selling apps of the year, with Facebook and Minecraft both topping best seller charts from the App Store. Facebook's dedicated chat app was the most downloaded free app for iPhones in 2014, ahead of other social networking apps WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram. You're welcome, America: As part of its latest figures, Apple has put a number to the jobs it has created or supported at home: 1.03 million. CEO Tim Cook pictured. The official Facebook app was also fourth in the list, while dating app Tinder came in tenth place. Minecraft, the game that allows players to build their own world from scratch using the game's signature blocks, was the most popular paid-for app for both iPhone and iPad devices for the second year running. It beat 7 Minute Workout challenge on iPhone, and Football Manager Handheld 2014 on iPad. The mobile version of classic console title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and puzzle game Cut The Rope 2 also made the top 10 on both iPad and iPhone. In-app purchases - where users can pay to unlock extra features - are also a large part of the App Store, and both iPhone and iPad lists have a top two of Clash Of Clans and Candy Crush Saga, the popular war and puzzle games. iTunes has announced its biggest selling apps of the year. Minecraft (screenshot shown) was the most popular paid-for app, while the mobile version of classic console title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and puzzle game Cut The Rope 2 also made the top 10 on both iPad and iPhone. Clash Of Clans leads the way on iPad, with Candy Crush grossing more on iPhone. Both featured on the list last year too. Kim Kardashian's self-titled Hollywood game also made the top 10, reaching eighth place. Apple's flagship tablet, the iPad, was most commonly used for communicating and streaming video, according to the charts, with the top two free downloads on iPad being video-calling service Skype and Facebook Messenger. Last year, Facebook Messenger did not feature in any of the top ten lists, showing the rapid rise of the messaging app. It was followed by subscription video-streaming service Netflix in third and YouTube in fourth. And while Microsoft only made the mobile version of Word free to all in November, the app still managed to reach fifth in the free iPad apps list. Facebook's dedicated chat app, Facebook Messenger (shown), was the most downloaded free app for iPhones in 2014, ahead of other social networking apps WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram . Apple also handed out their own editorial awards for their pick of the apps of the year, with Replay Video Editor named iPhone app of the year. The app was shown off on-stage during Apple's iPad event in October, and has now scooped the top iPhone prize. iPhone game of the year was puzzle title Threes!, where players have to add and match numbers in order to get a high score. Industry magazine deputy editor and app expert Jack Parsons said of the awards: 'We've seen a big year for indie games on iOS, and this is reflected in Apple awarding the iPhone and iPad games of the year to Threes! and British-made Monument Valley. In 2013 Snapchat (headquarters shown) was top of the messaging apps, but this year it had to settle for a place behind both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp . 'However, while these paid-for games have a lot of critical and commercial success, it's no surprise ""freemium"" games Candy Crush and Clash Of Clans remain the real winners, grossing more in in-app purchases than anyone else. 'The awards for Pixelmator and Replay are well deserved but unsurprising as Apple featured both of them in its keynote.' Pixelmator was named Apple's iPad app of the year having made the jump to mobile this year after previously only being available on desktop. The best iPad game was Monument Valley, from British-based developers ustwo, who also recently picked up an Apple design award for their work on the game.","iOS ecosystem has created 627,000 jobs in the US since 2008 .

"A puppy has survived after vets pulled out a 10-inch sewing needle that impaled the dog's chest and pierced its heart. Four-month-old Tutti fell on the needle in Chris Shaw and Bradley Justice's home in Durham, North Carolina, on New Year's Eve. The object speared the 10-pound papillion as it jumped from the sofa to a coffee table, just after it had been bathed by its owners. Lucky escape: A four-month-old puppy survived after vets extracted a needle that  pierced its heart. This X-Ray shows the needle inside the dog before the procedure . Speared: The papillion called Tutti fell on the sewing needle in Durham, North Carolina on New Year's Eve. Vets at the Triangle Veterinary Referral Hospital have fitted a cone . Tutti was then rushed to the Triangle Veterinary Referral Hospital where X-rays showed it had speared its chest and reached the animal's heart. The vets were able to extract the object by sliding it out while the animal was sedated. Veterinary cardiologist Jennifer Myers, 31, told The News Observer: 'The owners were definitely, understandably, upset and concerned. The dog was remarkably calm. 'The first question is, ""How far in does this go, and is it damaging anything on its way in?"" She added: 'The first few minutes were the most critical. Once she woke up from anesthesia, she was a very sweet little dog. Procedure: The team treating Tutti were able to extract the object by pulling it out while Tutti was sedated . Extracted: Veterinary cardiologist Jennifer Myers described how Tutti wanted to be 'held and cuddled' after the needle was taken out . 'Really, she woke up and was looking around. She wanted to be held and cuddled.' Owner Mr Shaw told WSAV that the needle was sticking out of Tutti's chest as they drove the dog to the hospital. He described how he came in to find the dog virtually lifeless on the floor or his living room and thought she had already died. He said: 'Brad had been knitting a Barbie-sized sweater and had put his knitting on the coffee table and [we] figure that she got a hold of it and possibly jumped off of our sofa. 'She went limp and stuck her tongue out, and we thought she had expired.' Just 24 hours later, Tutti was back home and fitted with a cone.","Tutti fell on the needle in her owner's home in Durham, North Carolina .

Erin Bird, 18, and Ramon Mitchell, 29, were charged with lewd and lascivious behaviour after they were caught in flagrante delicto at Mike’s Auto Sales in West Palm Beach, Florida. Police said a witness called them just before midnight on Monday to report a naked couple enjoying each other's company on top of a 2004 white Kia Sedona parked inside the dealership. Caught in flagrante delicto: Ramon Mitchell, 29, left, and Erin Bird, 18, right, were seen on Monday night allegedly having sex on top of a car at a car dealership in West Palm Beach, Florida, and arrested . 'Officers made contact with the complainant who advised he just witnessed both subjects having sex on top of the vehicle in plain sight,' a police incident report said. The caller told officers he could hear the pair moaning, and that he was upset and offended by what he had seen, the Sun-Sentinel reported. By the time police arrived they found Byrd and Mitchell inside a white van, putting their clothes back on. The van also belonged to the dealership, police said. Officers arrested the pair, but as they put the handcuffs on Mitchell he spat in the face of one, who was then forced to go to St Mary's Medical Centre for 'bio-hazard exposure', according to wsbradio.com. Bird and Mitchell were charged with lewd and lascivious behaviour, auto burglary and trespass after the incident at Mike’s Auto Sales, pictured. Mitchell was also charged with aggravated assault on a police officer . Michael Melendez, owner of Mikes Auto Sales, told police the pair had no permission to be on his property, according to the police report. As well as the charge of lewd and lascivious behaviour, Byrd and Mitchell were each charged with auto burglary and trespass. Mitchell also faces a further charge of aggravated assault for spitting at an officer. Byrd was released from jail the following day, while Mitchell is being held on $11,000 bail.","A witness spotted the pair naked on top of a white 2004 Kia Sedona .

"They were once the proud centrepiece of a family's Christmas decoration decked in fairy lights and baubles. But now, with the festive season well and truly over, these trees were left discarded in the street along with the other rubbish ready to be taken away by the bin men. Over the past few days, homes up and down the country have taken down their festive decorations after welcoming in 2015. A forlorn looking unwanted Christmas tree is left out on the street with bags of rubbish and recycling boxes in London . These trees will have once been decked the fairy lights and baubles, but are now left out to be taken away by bin men . Once the centrepiece of one families Christmas decoration, this tree is left dumped on the street with a bag of rubbish . And in Twickenham, London people left their now forlorn looking trees outside their houses, ready for them to be taken away with the rubbish. The scene was mirrored up and down the country as people returned to work and school following the Christmas break. According to the tradition, Christmas decorations should come down on the Twelfth Night which officially falls on January 5. Up and down the country, people were throwing away their old Christmas trees after the festive season came to an end . A lonely-looking fir tree is propped up outside a house before it is taken away by refuse collectors . Most people were throwing out their trees following the Twelfth Night earlier this week, which officially marks the end of Christmas . There is a widely-held belief that it is bad luck to leave Christmas decorations, including the tree, up past Twelfth Night – an idea previously attached to the festival of Candlemass in early February. There is also some debate over when exactly Twelfth Night falls, with some arguing it is the evening before the Twelfth Day, also known as the Epiphany. Others say it falls the following evening, as Twelfth Day itself draws to a close.

"Train passengers in England could cut their fares by more than 60 per cent - by buying their tickets a few miles over the border in Wales. A study has found that English commuters are shelling out more than those in Wales because of subsides on Welsh rail travel - funded by the taxpayer. The survey has found that people travelling from Bristol - 20 miles from the Welsh border - are paying over £50 more for journeys to major UK cities such as Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. Scroll down for video . Train passengers in England could cut their fares by more than 60 per cent - by buying their tickets a few miles over the border in Wales . The survey has found that people travelling from Bristol - 20 miles from the Welsh border - are paying over £50 more for journeys to major UK cities such as Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield . Whereas peak time tickets bought in Newport or Cardiff to the same destinations are up to £58.60 cheaper. It comes as figures from the Office of Rail Regulation reveal huge disparities between the government funding for passenger journeys, varying from an average of £2.19 per journey in England to £9.33 in Wales. Consequently Welsh provider Arriva Trains would be able to claim 13.07 pence per kilometre travelled by passengers from the taxpayer, on top of the fares passengers have already paid to travel. English train providers, like First Great Western and CrossCountry, receive far less, with CrossCountry receiving 1p per passenger kilometre in England. As a proportion of total income in the last financial year, Wales received 56 per cent in subsidies, compared with 27 per cent in England. A trip to Manchester during morning rush hour on Monday next week will cost £80.70 from Bristol Temple Meads, according to the research by the Bristol Post newspaper. But in Newport, peak time tickets to major cities are up to £58.60 cheaper than those bought in Bristol . But a train leaving Newport just four minutes later travelling to the same destination will cost less than half the price - only £32. A four-hour journey from Bristol to Sheffield will cost £92.60, but a train leaving 10 minutes earlier from Newport or Cardiff would cost just £34 - a saving of £58.60. Services from Cardiff to Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Blackpool also proved cheaper than travelling from Bristol, but with just minutes added to the journey. Tickets from Bristol to Newport are £11.20 while fares from Bristol to Cardiff are £12.40, . Christopher Irwin, a director of Travel Watch South West, said difference in ticket price is a legacy of the system used by nationalised operator British Rail, which was privatised during the 1990s. He said: 'The history of British Rail helps us understand how fares are priced. 'Before the railway was privatised, lines used to be classified in three categories; intercity fares, South East fares, which covered a lot of lines to and from London, and regional railway fares. 'Traditionally regional lines would charge less, as those journeys would contain more stops and take slightly longer. 'Something like Bristol to Manchester would be classed as an intercity line, whereas something leaving from Newport and travelling through Wales is likely to be a regional line and would cost less. 'Lines, or flows, are still considered when setting ticket prices.' Market demand as well as the rail provider, reliability, choice and comfort affect the cost of tickets, according to Mr Irwin. He said: 'There are also many other factors that contribute to how rail tickets are priced and it has a lot to do with the service provider. 'For example bigger service providers often offer more flexibility in their tickets and can be more luxurious, which means they cost more. 'You also pay for market demand. I expect these routes from Newport and Cardiff are less popular than from Bristol.'","There are huge disparities between tickets bought in Bristol and Newport .

Barry Lyttle, 33, was arrested and charged after allegedly punching his younger brother Patrick, 31, at about 3am on Saturday in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district. Patrick was rushed to hospital and spent most of the week in a critical but stable condition in an induced coma. But speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia on Friday afternoon, Barry confirmed his brother Patrick was no longer in on life support and is in a stable condition, sitting up in bed at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner east. Scroll down for video . Barry uploaded this photo with Patrick, right, and their father, centre, on Friday, hours after his brother woke up .

Barry and their father, Oliver, have been a constant presence by Patrick's bedside since the devastating incident. St Vincent's spokesman David Faktor told Daily Mail Australia there had been 'good news' 'He's conscious. He's still in ICU (the Intensive Care Unit) but he's stable,' Mr Faktor said. 'He's been taken off life support. He's sitting up.' Mr Faktor was unable to comment on whether Patrick was talking.

A tearful Oliver Lyttle told reporters on Monday his sons had loved each other since they were children. 'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done. 'I want to thank everybody for the way things have went (in court today) and their sympathy.' As part of his bail conditions, Barry had to hand over his Irish passport to authorities.

Paramedics treated Patrick at the scene before taking him to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Police described the incident as a 'family tragedy' and Detective Superintendent Michael Fitzgerald said the 'pain in their father's eyes was indescribable'. The incident was caught on CCTV cameras and Barry reportedly screamed in shock and distress when he realised the extent of his brother's injuries. Alcohol was not a factor in the fight with Barry's blood alcohol concentration reading in the low range. The fight was said to have occurred after a minor argument. In a series of  Facebook posts before the incident, the brothers had previously expressed how excited they were about their Australian reunion. Patrick has been travelling around Australia for the past six months and often received messages from Barry advising him to 'stay safe'.

"Deputies helped a family of four on a Michigan highway early Wednesday morning, after their minivan was unwittingly hauled by a semi-truck for 16 miles.

"A train station in suburbia might not be the most romantic scene for a proposal in most women's book. But romantic Samuel Goetsch was certain that the platform at Surbiton, Surrey, would be just perfect for him to pop the question to Harry Potter-mad girlfriend Stephanie Dodd. The station features in a pivotal scene in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Unfortunately, the 24-year-old from Houston, Texas, hadn't reckoned on the temperamental timings of the British rail network. After flying his girlfriend 5,000 miles across the world to his father's house in Ashford, Surrey, he realised trains to the station were not running because of weekend cancellations by South West Trains. Samuel Goetsch, from Houston, Texas, was certain that the platform at Surbiton would be just perfect for him to pop the question to Harry Potter mad girlfriend Stephanie Dodd  - but struggled to get there thanks to train cancellations . Mr Goetsch, 24, had flown with Miss Dodd, 25, from Houston, Texas to propose in the station, backdrop to a poignant scene about new beginnings. In the film Dumbledore encounters Harry at platform three of Surbiton station and spirits him away from the mundane world of muggles to Budleigh Babberton. When realised the trains weren't running he had to think of a reason to get the bus to the station or risk his carefully planned surprise falling apart. His father Stephen, who lives in Ashtead , Surrey, was at the proposal. He said: 'My son wanted to ask Stephanie to marry him there because the scene in the movie is all about new beginnings. The station features in a pivotal scene in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. In the film Dumbledore encounters Harry at platform three of Surbiton station and spirits him away from the mundane world of muggles to Budleigh Babberton . 'I don't think he thought it would be a problem getting to the station but it didn't go as smoothly as he thought. 'Stephanie had no idea so my son had to do some quick thinking working up a reason to get her to the station. 'He had to pretend he had some business in Surbiton and convince her to go with him.' The couple met while they were both studying abroad in Japan in 2011 and headed back to Texas the day after the proposal. After flying his girlfriend 5,000 miles across the world to his father's house in Ashford, Surrey, he realised trains to the station were not running because of weekend cancellations by South West Trains . Thankfully, he was able to take a bus to the station after developing an elaborate back story - and Miss Dodd was so impressed she said yes . Mr Goetsch said: 'They were actually in Japan at the time of the huge earthquake so I guess there are quite a few times in their relationship when things haven't gone as smoothly as possible. 'This was Stephanie's first visit to England and it's great that it's definitely one she will remember.' Mr Goetsch brought a copy of the Harry Potter book with him to present to his fiancé along with the engagement ring. Caroline Landu, who was working at the station, said: 'It's not something you see every day so I got them to pose for a photo with the book. 'I found out they were big Harry Potter fans so it is a romantic thing to do.'","Surbiton station in Surrey features in a key scene in a Harry Potter film .

"Literary giant Joan Didion has revealed that she had 'no idea' her recent foray into modeling for high-end French label Céline would be the focus of such a huge amount of social media interest. Speaking to the New York Times from her Upper East Side residence, which is where her stark portrait for the Spring 2015 campaign was taken, the 80-year-old author admitted she was surprised to hear what a stir the new ads had caused. 'I have no clue,' she said of the excitement surrounding the campaign, which was shot by photographer Juergen Teller. 'I have no idea.' Scroll down for video . Spring 2015: Eighty-year-old literary giant Joan Didion has been unveiled as the new face of French label Céline (pictured) The renowned writer also added that she has never before attended a Céline show, although she would 'love to' in the future, but that she is indeed a fan of the brand and owns 'a few' of their pricey pieces, although she declined to specify which items exactly. Describing Ms Didion as being 'as crisp as one of Phoebe Philo’s cotton tunics', the New York Times' Alexandra Jacobs added that fashion's newest darling was quick to remind her that the Céline campaign is not her first job as a model. 'Ms. Didion also reminded this reporter that this is not the first time she has acted as a model,' Ms Jacobs wrote. 'Besides the famous cover image of her peering out of her Corvette for her memoir “Where I Was From"" - to which Céline paid apparent homage with earlier shots of their usual model, Daria Werbowy - she appeared in a 1991 ad for the Gap.' Following its official launch on Tuesday afternoon, interest in the striking Céline campaign quickly reached fever pitch on social media, with tens of thousands of fashion and literature fans taking to Twitter and Instagram to share their excitement at Ms Didion's starring role. Ever-chic: Ms Didion - who suffers from multiple sclerosis  - is based in New York City and is currently the subject of a documentary about her life, We Tell Ourselves Stories In Order to Live . Yesteryear: Ms Didion in her youth, posing from the seat of her Corvette Stingray, has long been a style icon . The minimalist portrait, which is typical of Céline's preferred aesthetic, sees the American writer and long-time style icon pose in a pair of statement sunglasses wearing a navy sweater and a gold pendant. Ms Didion - who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is said to be in frail health - is based in New York City and is currently the subject of a documentary about her life, We Tell Ourselves Stories In Order to Live, being filmed by her nephew, filmmaker Griffin Dunne. Described by Vogue as being perhaps 'the ultimate Céline woman', she has always shrugged off the notion that she is a fashion icon. In her 1979 autobiographical book The White Album, she famously described her sartorial uniform as comprising of merely 'two skirts, two jerseys or leotards and one sweater.' Modest: Ms Didion (pictured), described by Vogue as being perhaps 'the ultimate Céline woman', has always shrugged off the notion that she is a fashion icon . Family: Ms Didion (right) spent most of her long-spanning career  living in California with her husband John Gregory Dunne (center), a fellow writer she married in 1964 and their daughter Quintana Roo Dunne (left) Still, Ms Didion found fame as a Vogue copywriter in the late 50s, which must have rubbed off on her, and her effortless-chic style has been idolized  ever since. Céline's decision - overseen by the label's creative director Phoebe Philo - to cast her as its latest muse is a testament to this. Ms Didion spent most of her long-spanning career as a journalist, essayist and novelist living in California with her husband John Gregory Dunne, a fellow writer she married in 1964. Tragedy struck, however, when John died suddenly of a heart attack in 2003, leaving Ms Didion a widow after almost 40 years of marriage. Double the loss: Tragedy struck Ms Didion (left) when John (right) died suddenly of a heart attack in 2003, followed by Quintana less than two years later . Well-deserved: In July 2013, Joan was awarded with a National Medal of Arts and Humanity for her writing by President Barack Obama (pictured) Less than two years later, the couple's only daughter Quintana Roo Dunne died at the age of only 39 after a series of illnesses culminating in a fatal bout of acute pancreatitis. Some theorize Quintana's death was a result of her acknowledged alcoholism, although this was never mentioned by family members. Ms Didion subsequently wrote two memoirs which dealt with her grieving process; A Year of Magical Thinking in 2005 and Blue Nights in 2011. In July 2013, she was awarded with a National Medal of Arts and Humanity by President Barack Obama.",The author also revealed to the New York Times that she has never attended a Céline show but would 'love to' in the future .
"An Oklahoma school district has canceled all classes after a kindergartner died of a mysterious illness after she was sent home with a fever.

It is not yet know what caused Jenny's death. The medical examiner says results of an autopsy are pending a toxicology report. Jenny Yang, 6, died shortly after she was sent home from school in Oklahoma with a fever . According to a GoFundMe page set up by her brother, Jenny was found unresponsive Monday night after she went to sleep on a couch after being sent home from school. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her parents, who are immigrants who came to the US in 2005, were traveling at the time of her death and were not home. She was one of seven children. Her uncle Xiong Yang told KOKI-TV: 'She’s never been sick. She’s such an outgoing child. One day she’s here and the next day she’s not here anymore.' Her cause of death is not yet known and medical examiners are waiting on test results before they can figure out how she died so suddenly . It's unknown whether Janny had a communicable disease that caused her death. In September and October more than 1,100 people - many of them young school children - fell ill with contagious enterovirus and several died suddenly from the respiratory infection and polio-like symptoms. School superintendent Max Tanner says the district has been following the advice of the county and state health departments. A GoFundMe page established to pay for Jenny's funeral has raised more than $7,100 for the family in just a few days.","Jenny Yang died suddenly hours after being sent home from school .

"The groundhog might see his shadow on February 2 - but he won't be seeing Mayor Bill de Blasio. A year after a groundhog slipped from Mr de Blasio's grasp during the annual Staten Island Zoo Groundhog Day ceremony, the zoo is reportedly making a change to prevent the mayor from handling the animal. Mayor de Blasio, for one, would be happy with the new plan. Scroll down for video . Chuck! Noooo! This is the moment New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped Staten Island's groundhog at the annual event in February last year. The animal later died of internal injuries, a post-mortem exam found . 'I think reform is needed,' he joked during an unrelated news conference in Brooklyn yesterday. 'I welcome a new approach.' A year ago, the creature squirmed from de Blasio's grasp after predicting six more weeks of winter and fell several feet to the ground. It died a week later. A post-mortem revealed it suffered internal injuries, but it was not clear if they stemmed from the fall. Moreover, it was revealed that the rodent that died was not the zoo's famed Staten Island Chuck, but rather a female stand-in named Charlotte. The zoo did not notify the mayor's office about the death. The story prompted a flood of Twitter jokes about a #Groundhoghazi cover-up and Mr de Blasio's possible impeachment. And it wasn't even the first time a mayor had had an unfortunate run-in with a Staten Island groundhog: A squirming Chuck bit then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009. Taking no chances: This year the zoo won't allow the mayor to hold the groundhog and it will instead be kept inside a plexiglass case to avoid any more unfortunate accidents . This February the zoo is changing its ceremony so the mayor won't pick up the animal. Instead, it will be in a plexiglass case. A spokesman at the zoo declined to comment. Last year was Mr de Blasio's first time participating in the ceremony. He admitted yesterday that he wasn't ready to handle the groundhog. 'I must say last time, there was not an overwhelming amount of preparation and orientation before I was handed him,' Mr de Blasio said. 'May he rest in peace.' The zoo has four groundhogs, all with the variations of the brand name 'Chuck.' On the morning of February 2, zoo staff select which of the groundhogs will participate in the ceremony and be dubbed Chuck for the day. The animal's formal name is Charles G. Hogg.","Last year's groundhog died of internal injuries after it fell to the ground .

"Prehistoric humans had teeth that were much stronger than their modern counterparts and were more like those of sea otters, which are capable of cracking open shellfish with their jaws. A new study of the structure of tooth enamel has found that our early human ancestors had teeth that were surprisingly similar to those of the marine mammal. Researchers at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and George Washington University, found that teeth with this structure are capable of withstanding huge bite forces. Sea otters' teeth are so strong they are capable of cracking open shell fish like clams, as seen above . This suggests that our prehistoric ancestors jaws were far more powerful than our own, perhaps allowing them to crack open nuts and bones to get to the marrow inside. The news could help anthropologists build up a more accurate picture of what our ancestors may have looked like. An ancient relative of humans dubbed 'Nutcracker Man' because of his powerful jaws and huge teeth may have actually preferred to eat grass, according to a recent study. Paranthropus boisei lived in Africa more than one million years ago and lived side-by-side with direct ancestors of humans. It has long been assumed that this species lived on a diet of nuts, seeds and hard fruit because of its powerful jaw muscles and the biggest and flattest molars of any known hominid in the anthropological record. However, Professor Matt Sponheimer of the University of Colorado Boulder said studies of the wear marks on the teeth from P. boisei suggest it was eating soft fruit and grasses. He also found that carbon isotopes embedded in fossil teeth indicated that the Nutcracker man may have lived on large amounts of grasses and sedges. He said: 'Frankly, we didn't expect to find the primate equivalent of a cow dangling from a remote twig of our family tree.' The new study, which is published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, found that sea otter tooth enamel had high numbers of curved bands of crystals - 19 per millimetre. This was found to be comparable to the number seen in large flat teeth of the hominin known as Paranthropus boisei that lived in Africa more than million years ago. Fossilised teeth from prehistoric Homo sapiens found in Africa are also known to have 16 of these bands per millimetre. Modern humans, however, have just 14 bands per millimetre. This banding of crystals in tooth enamel is sometimes known as decussation. When the researchers conducted tests on the otter's teeth, they found that they were able to withstand nearly three times as much pressure before chipping than modern human teeth. Similar chips have been found in fossilised teeth of human ancestors. Dr Adam van Casteren, a research fellow who led the study at the Max Planck Weizmann Center for Integrative Archaeology and Anthropology, said: 'Sea otter enamel is much tougher than that of humans. 'Some sectional images of fossil hominin teeth show greater decussation than in modern humans. 'Estimates of 16 bands per millimetre in East African early Homo sapiens and 19 bands per millimetre in P. boisei fossils are strikingly similar to sea otter data. 'The explanation may be dietary — to avoid teeth being chipped during hard object feeding involving high bite forces.' The bands of crystals in the enamal of sea otter teeth (above) were similar to those in fossilised humans . The broad flat teeth of Paranthropus boisei, seen above in this fossilised skull, have led some anthropologists to nickname the early human 'Nutcracker Man' as they believe it lived on a diet of hard nuts and fruits . Sea otters' teeth (left) were found to have similar structures to those of early fossils of Homo sapiens (right) Fossilised remains of early hominins like P. boisei have led anthropologists to conclude that they lived on a diet of hard nuts, seeds and fruits. They have some of the largest and flattest molars of any hominin fossil found to date and their teeth are covered in a thick layer of enamel. However, a study in 2011 claimed that these large teeth were perhaps used by P. boisei to eat grass much like a cow. The latest findings, however, suggest these ancient humans had a formidable bite force and suggests that they tackled food somewhat tougher than grass. Sea otters, for example, use their powerful teeth, which the researchers found could resist chipping at an average pressure of 2,800 Pascals per half metre. Human teeth are able to resist chipping at an average of just 1,000 Pascals per half metre. Dr Casteren said: 'Using toughness estimates for modern human enamel, the sizes of some ante-mortem chips in fossil hominin enamel suggest kilonewton forces. 'If the toughness of sea otter enamel were assumed for robust hominins like P. boisei, then this would predict exceptionally high critical tooth fracture loads.' Sea otters eat hard-shelled clams, mussels and crabs, often cracking them open while floating on their backs . Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the new study opens up some interesting questions about what lead to the extinction of Paranthropus boisei. He said: 'The genus Paranthropus have always been an odd group of hominins. 'They lived alongside the Australopithecines and members of our own genus, Homo, from around 2.5 to 1 million years ago. 'Their massive jaws and huge teeth suggest that they evolved to eat some incredibly hard foodstuffs and to exploit the same sort of habitat as prehistoric African pigs. 'Their extinction has long been blamed on an inability to out compete the pigs but this study suggests that the teeth of Paranthropus were capable of chewing up even harder food stuffs than previously thought - perhaps even bone. 'It seems that while our direct ancestors such as Homo erectus were using cultural adaptations like stone tools the Paranthropines had evolved a biological tool kit in the form of massive teeth capable of chewing ineradicable hard material in an ultimately doomed bid to compete against nature’s supreme waste disposal machine - the pig.'","Researchers in Germany and the US studied the structure of tooth enamal .

"China's minute capsule hotels are gleaning popularity with young travellers due to their very affordable price tags. The Space Capsule hotel, in Taiyuan, in the Shanxi province, is one of many to open up in China, after the trend for sleep pods began in Japan, decades ago. Each of the pokey rooms measure a mere 4.3 feet by 6.6 feet, but costs just under £7 ($10.59) per night to stay in, making them a tempting prospect for budget travellers and young people. The 5,200 square-foot building consists of 86 fibreglass capsules in nine rooms, each named after star signs to reflect the space theme. Along with a simple bed, the rooms contain a  mirror, television, smoke detector, coat hook and fold-down computer desk. Each is also equipped with is a plug socket, smoke detector and a fan.There's a wireless network for those who wish to stay connected, and even a selection of  soundproofed capsules reserved for people who snore. According to Chinese newspaper, Xinhua, the hotel manager Xu Meijang was inspired to open the unusual business by the popularity of sleep pod hotels in Japan and by the number of generally young travellers requiring an affordable night's stay in the area.

"Last year, Dennis Rodman sang him a bizarre rendition of happy birthday as adoring crowds clapped in unison during a basketball game in Pyongyang. With the former basketball star out of town, Korean dictator Kim Jong-un will have to settle for his usual entourage of fawning and fearful officials as he celebrates another year. January 8 is said to be Kim's official birthday - though his exact age remains a closely-guarded secret - like many of the details surrounding the dictator's reign. Still, the date could be the cue for another peculiar photo to appear of the dictator who has been been photographed countless times in a variety of strange situations since taking power in 2011. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured on board a submarine as he inspected a navy unit stationed on the east coast of the country last June . Kim was recently pictured delivering his annual New Year speech in Pyongyang - with severely over-plucked eyebrows. Comparisons with earlier photos suggests the North Korean leader has defied the Cara Delevingne trend - opting instead for far shorter and less prominent brows. In November 2014 Kim was left looking silly when a pair of cuddly toys appearing to have sex 'photobombed' his picture at an orphanage. As he leant against a bed, he seemed oblivious to the two soft toys placed in a compromising position on a wardrobe in the corner of the room. Photobomb: Kim was oblivious to the pair of cuddly toys placed in a compromising position on a wardrobe behind him as he visited an orphanage in Pyongyang in October last year . Tips from Putin: A photo of Kim riding a horse during an inspection of an army base was released in 2012 . Over-plucked: Pictures of Kim in 2015 (L) and 2012 (R) show a significant difference in the length of the despot's eyebrows . A series of photographs that circulated around the world last June showed the leader apparently teaching a submarine crew drills and tutoring the vessel's captain on  how to navigate as he visited a navy unit. Dramatic pictures released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, showed the despot rising from the lookout tower of the submarine and later looking intently through the vessel's periscope. The paper said Kim called for the crew on the submarine to 'devote their wisdom and enthusiasm to rounding off the combat preparations'. Last year, Kim was not seen in public for five weeks - with some analysts speculating that a military coup had taken place. Unlikely friendship: Kim pictured with former NBA star Dennis Rodman at a basketball game in Pyongyang in 2013 . Bizarre rendition: Rodman sang the dictator happy birthday in the country's capital this time last year . Little and large: The pair were pictured with other former NBA players in a gym in Pyongyang last January . Other rumours had the dictator suffering from gout - after experts analysed his limping gait in video clips taken during a public outing. It was claimed Kim had been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland. Such theories were inflamed by older images of the leader inspecting food factories up and down the secretive country. In one picture the despot was shown sitting in a chair while advising officials on the best practice in the running of such a factory. Food inspection: The leader was pictured concentrating intently on plates of food an army base in 2012 . Offering advice: Kim sits in the middle of officials at a food factory last year while offering management tips . Kim has formed a close friendship with former NBA star Dennis Rodman and the pair have spent a considerable amount of time together - with Rodman even belting out happy birthday at an official gathering this time last year. The ex-basketball player also posed for a group photo with Kim and other former NBA players at the Pyongyang Gymnasium in January 2014. In 2012, Kim sparked rumours that he had hired Vladimir Putin's PR team after images were released of him riding a horse as he inspected an army training ground in an undisclosed part of the country. Showing his thrill-seeking side once more, Kim was also captured taking a ride on a roller-coaster at a theme park in the country's capital in 2012. Tight squeeze: Kim is shown the controls of a fighter jet in this propoganda image released late last year . Thrill-seeker: Kim was seen enjoying a ride on a roller-coaster in the capital in 2012 with a British diplomat (circled) He has been snapped in the cockpit of a plane on at least a couple of occasions. This month he supposedly flew a plane for a North Korean TV documentary. He was earlier seen squeezed into the cockpit of a fighter jet in October as officers taught him the controls. Kim was famously pictured taking a lonely ride on a chairlift at a purpose-built ski resort in 2013. The communist enclave's one and only ski destination, on top of Taehwa Peak, boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms, complimentary toiletries, and spa facilities and 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes. Other snaps of Kim include his trip to a mushroom farm and his visit to an aquarium - where he was pictured excitedly stroking a model octopus' tentacle. Outing: The dictator smiles delightedly as he walks through a viewing tunnel on a visit to an aquarium last year . Definitely not real! The leader was seen excitedly stroking a model octopus' tentacle during the outing . Kim smiles during a visit to the Chonji Lubricant Factory, in this photo taken in Pyongyang in 2014 . On countless occasions the leader has been seen surrounded by sobbing and delirious-looking citizens during public outings. One notable shot shows Kim flanked by a crowd of weeping members of the Korean Children's Union in 2012 - with the leader wearing a Scout-style scarf around his neck. Compared to his predecessors, Kim's birthday celebrations since he took power following the death of his father have been fairly low key. The birthday of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the country, is considered the Day of the Sun and falls on April 15. Kim's father, Kim Jong Il had a birthday on February 16 - which is known as the Day of the Shining Star in North Korea.

'There's a lot of speculation why that's the case,' Lee Jung Hoon, professor of international relations at Yonsei University in South Korea, told CNN. 'Kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy, that he's not extravagant. Then there's sort of negative take on this issue, as to he's still very young, 29, 30 or 31. 'When you start marking his birthday, then the whole North Korean people will start to wonder, then what's his age?' Missile testing fun: Kim smiles along with excited officials as they watch missile tests in North Korea .

In this image Kim is inspecting a tank during a video documentary at an unknown location in 2012 . The Unification Ministry records Kim's birthday as January 8 - but the exact year of birth is marked as 1982, 1983 or 1984. In Kim's three years in power, he's followed the legacies of his father and grandfather in his attitude towards the outside world. A South Korean report released this week indicated that North Korea could be closer to miniaturizing a nuclear warhead indicating that Kim has continued focusing on nuclear weapons. And his regime has also been marked by the purge of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was executed as a traitor in December 2013 - with some suggesting he was thrown to a pit of starving dogs.

"Three nine-year-old girls allegedly plotted to kill their teacher with hand-sanitizer because they thought she was mean and they knew she was highly allergic to the antibacterial substance. The group of 4th-graders from Elba Central School near the city of Batavia in New York are believed to have spoken to classmates about their plans just before they went on winter break. However their plan was foiled when a concerned school board member called the police. They were told earlier in the year they were not allowed to bring sanitizer into the classroom because of their teacher's severe allergies, suggesting they knew it would cause her health significant health problems. Plot: The group of 4th-graders from Elba Central School in upstate New York are believed to have spoken to classmates about their plans to kill their teacher with hand-sanitizer just before they went on winter break . So they discussed spreading the liquid on items the teacher frequently touched - which is when someone overheard them and told their parents. Joyce Veraccini, whose son was in the same class as the girls, told WHAM: 'He told me that a bunch of girls in this class was threatening with hand sanitizer on the teacher and it's just shocking.' Those suspected of the potentially deadly plan were then interviewed by Genessee County Sheriff's Office who reportedly concluded that the motive behind the plot was that the group thought their teacher was 'mean'. According to WGRZ, one of the students stated that her teacher 'yells at us and that the class has problems with her.' Another tried to imply that the plan to poison the teacher, who has not been named, started with another pupil. The Genessee Sheriff's Department, who filed an incident report on the matter, suggested that there was bullying in the class and certain members had struggled to work together. After the pupils allegedly contradicted themselves during the interviews, the school decided to take over the matter from law enforcement and deal with it themselves. However it is not known whether the children have been punished. Reaction: The group are believed to have discussed covering items the teacher frequently touched in the antibacterial substance because they knew she was severely allergic to it (file picture) Deputy Sheriff Jerome Brewster said: 'It's not a crime to think about hurting someone. It only becomes a crime when you take action on that thought.' He added that their case could not go to family court unless it was a misdemeanor or felony. Elba Superintendent Jerome Piwko responded to the incident in a statement released on Thursday. He said: 'It has been widely reported that certain fourth grade students had been discussing a way to harm a teacher in the Elba Central School District. This event has been a shock to our community and school. 'The District cannot comment on the specifics of this event, including disicipline, as the information is protected from disclosure under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. The reports in the media and on social media do not accurately reflect the entire event.' 'He added: As soon as the District was made aware of the students' discussion it called in students that were thought to have knowledge of the discussions. After the students were interviewed, the District contacted the Sheriff's Department and cooperated with the Sheriff's Deputies in their investigation of the matter. 'The Sheriff's Department concluded that no crime had been committed and the matter was turned back over to the District. The District in turn has worked with the parents and students involved to address this issue. 'It is important to note that no one was injured or actually placed in harm's way. 'The District does not condone any of the behaviors that have been reported and is in the process of working alongside the Sheriff's Department to use this incident as a vehicle for educating the District's students regarding appropriate behaviors.'","The 4th-graders allegedly made the plan at Elba Central School, New York .

"Nearly a million patients are heading to A&E every year because they cannot get an appointment with their GP, figures reveal. Data from the Government’s own survey provide fresh evidence that Britain’s casualty ward crisis has been driven by the struggle to access a family doctor. David Cameron yesterday said the pressures would be eased by giving the over-65s better access to GPs and more care at home – but conceded it would ‘take time’. Scroll down for video . Nearly a million patients are heading to A&E every year because they cannot get an appointment with their GP, figures reveal . Labour tried to blame the Tories for a lack of appointments, but failed to admit that its botched GP contract in 2004 had awarded doctors huge pay rises but allowed them to stop out-of-hours and weekend working. However some doctors last night revealed that a drug-resistant strain of flu could be contributing to this year’s A&E crisis. At least one hospital said it is seeing rising numbers of patients with the influenza A H3 virus, a severe strain that had mutated since a commonly-used vaccine was prepared. The political row over access to GPs broke out over a Government survey of 880,000 patients. It revealed that about one in ten were unable to get an appointment with a doctor or practice nurse when they last tried – a figure of 5.8 million patients if extended across England. A further 7 per cent were offered appointments up to three weeks ahead – and said they gave up trying. Of these two groups of patients, one in ten said they went to an A&E or walk-in centre in the hope of seeing a doctor sooner. Across England, this is equivalent to about 940,000 patients – and a rise of almost 80,000 compared with calculations for last year. The Prime Minister told a meeting of business leaders in Manchester that the problem was caused by a rising ageing population finding it ever harder to see a family doctor. Parked side by side outside a Welsh A&E unit, 11 ambulances are forced to wait because casualty staff are too overwhelmed to accept patients. The picture, taken outside Wrexham Maelor hospital, exposes the scale of the crisis in Wales’s Labour-run NHS – where waiting times are even longer than those in England. Such scenes are by no means isolated, either, and on Monday there were 12 ambulances queuing outside the Heath hospital in Cardiff. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, blamed the crisis on a result of a ‘vicious cycle’ of under-funding by Labour. Struggling: Ambulances - not all of them visible - queue at Wrexham Maelor . ‘Despite the best efforts of dedicated Welsh NHS staff, ambulance response targets have not been met in Wales for several years and A&E waits continue to worsen on Labour’s watch,’ he said. The Mail last year revealed the scale of the NHS crisis in Wales, where patients have died on waiting lists and thousands are travelling to England for treatment. But problems persist in England itself, and it emerged yesterday that a hospital in Sheffield has asked for help from the Red Cross – better known for helping Third World disaster victims. The charity is providing two ambulances and a team of staff at the city’s Northern General, while bosses have also asked nurses in managerial roles to return to frontline duties. Backroom staff have been shifted on to wards to do admin jobs for nurses. An unprecedented 13 English hospitals have declared major incidents as they struggle to cope, as A&E waiting times plunged to their worst in a decade and just 92.6 per cent of patients were treated within four hours. But the figure is even worse in Wales – at just 83.8 per cent. Firemen have already warned that they were increasingly being asked to ferry patients to hospital instead of ambulances. It emerged yesterday that fire crews cut the ring off a stroke patient’s swollen finger because an ambulance was not expected for five hours. He said: ‘One blinding statistic is that there are a million more over-65s going to A&E this year than there were four years ago. So we have an ageing population, greater numbers of frail elderly.’ Labour, which analysed the survey figures, blamed the Government for under-investment in services to meet the needs of an ageing population. It said surgeries were too cash-strapped to open at evenings or weekends, employ extra doctors and nurses or open bigger premises. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham repeated his claim that the NHS will not ‘survive another five years of David Cameron’, adding: ‘He’s made it harder to get a GP appointment and it’s getting even worse, contributing to the current crisis in A&E.’ He claimed a Labour government would guarantee a GP appointment within 48 hours and allow patients to book further ahead with a GP of their choice. From the Daily Mail on December 23 . But the Tories pointed the finger at the 2004 GP contract – negotiated under Labour – which enabled doctors to opt out of evening and weekend care. Patients now have to navigate a confusing system of out-of-hours firms and walk-in centres – and many just go to A&E instead. A Government spokesman said Labour was making another attempt to distract from the botched 2004 GP contract. ‘That’s a real source of pressure on A&E, and one we’re sorting out by introducing evening and weekend GP access for ten million people,’ said the spokesman. Figures from the survey also show a steady fall in patient satisfaction. A fifth say they are not happy with GP opening hours. One in ten said receptionists were unhelpful and a quarter said it was difficult getting through on the phone. Meanwhile separate figures show ambulance response times at their worst since records began in 2010. Just 71.8 per cent of the most serious ‘Red 1’ calls – cardiac arrests and road accidents – were reached in eight minutes. The target is 75 per cent. Yesterday doctors also warned that a strain of flu not covered by seasonal vaccines is contributing to a significant rise in A&E admissions. Specialists at Southampton General Hospital said the number of patients admitted with respiratory illnesses had doubled – half of which were found to have the influenza A H3 virus. Dr Ben Marshall said the virus – a severe strain that had mutated since the vaccine was prepared – was adding ‘significant strain’ to stretched hospitals. Colleague Dr Tristan Clark said national cases were rising steadily and could continue for eight weeks. He said the ‘flu season’ began four weeks ago – earlier than last year, and admissions are up ‘significantly’.","Patients heading to A&E because they cannot get GP appointment, figures reveal .

"A schoolboy on a train was handed a 'Banksy' by a passenger claiming to be the elusive graffiti artist. Ben Azarya was handed the signed copy of an iconic print which he was told would be worth about £20,000 after he helped a stranger pick up his paints after the fell out of his bag. The man, on a train in Oxenholme, Cumbria, introduced himself as Robin Banks, a name that has been linked to Banksy. Scroll down for video . Ben Azarya (pictured with the print) 14, was given the print with a distinctive autograph by a man who introduced himself as Robin Banks- a name linked to Banksy . He signed a print of a flower thrower, with a distinctive autograph and gave it to the helpful 14-year-old telling him to 'have a good life'. Ben had no idea who Banksy was until he got home and looked him up on the internet. He said: 'He was on the phone for most of the time talking to someone called AK47. 'He opened his rucksack and had a gas mask and spray paints inside. He got out a piece of paper and had colours marked on it of what he had been trying out and he dropped his colours. 'Banksy' signed the print of a flower thrower with a distinctive autograph (pictured) and gave it to the helpful schoolboy telling him to 'have a good life' It was only after Ben went home and researched Banksy, that he began to realise the significance of his encounter . 'I picked them up for him and after that he started signing it in weird letters and numbers. He said 'do you know who Robin Banks is?'. 'I said no and he said 'this will be worth about £20,000 - have a good life, brother'.' Sadly though, it looks like the schoolboy will be disappointed as the real artist has come forward to say it wasn't him. A spokeswoman for the elusive graffiti artist said: 'It has got nothing to do with him. He doesn't know anything about it.' Ben didn't realise the significance of his encounter until he started researching Banksy. The artist's worldwide fame has seen prices for his work skyrocket, with his art fetching more than £1m at auction. Intense speculation surrounds his identity. Ben described him as: 'White, in his late 40s. He was wearing scruffy clothes and he had a black, fluffy hat which looked really old. Bannksy's work grew out of the Bristol underground scene, which involved collaborations between artists and musicians, and often provide a social or political commentary, pictured is Banksy's  'Roller Chimp' The artist's worldwide fame has seen prices for his work skyrocket, with his art fetching more than £1m at auction, pictured is seventeen works by Banksy including an image of model Kate Moss to sell at Bonhams . Banksy is also a film director and even appeared, although heavily pixelated, in his first film Exit Through the Gift Shop- billed as 'the world's first street art disaster movie' (pictured) 'He had a little jacket that didn't go over his arms and jeans with paint on. He looked really wacky and had blonde hair and blue eyes.' Ben and his mum Jan have been in touch with Bonhams Auction House, which advised them to get the print authenticated. If the trademark print proves to be a genuine Banksy, Ben says he has no qualms about selling his work of art. 'I will probably spend about £1,000 and get a new phone and save the rest,' he said. Mystery man: Banksy appears in his 2011 film Exit Through The Gift Shop . He's the Scarlet Pimpernel of modern art and his true identity remains a jealously guarded secret. His satirical street art, using his distinctive stenciling technique, often feature anti-establishment, anti-war or anti-capitalist themes. Banksy's work grew out of the Bristol underground scene, which involved collaborations between artists and musicians. Providing a political and social commentary, his art has since popped up on walls across the world. A network of myths has grown up around him. That his real name is Robin Banks. That he used to be a butcher. That his parents don't know what he does, believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator. Then there's the suggestion that Banksy is actually a collective of artists and doesn't exist at all. Banksy's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism. However by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation. He has been photographed in the past but always wearing a mask or hood. In 2008 he was reportedly 'unmasked' as Robin Gunningham, a former public schoolboy from Bristol with a passion for art. At the time Banksy's agent refused to confirm or deny the story. Banksy then wrote on his website:'I am unable to comment on who may or may not be Banksy, but anyone described as being 'good at drawing' doesn't sound like Banksy to me.' Fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film Exit Through The Gift Shop - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated.","Ben Azarya helped pick up a stranger's paints when they fell out of his bag .

"The amazing moment when a star whips through the gaseous emissions of its companion and carves out a 'tunnel' have been revealed in amazing 3D models. Eta Carinae is the most luminous and massive stellar system within 10,000 light-years of Earth, but the interaction of its two stars has been poorly understood. Now astronomers have been able to take a closer look at what is happening in this fascinating system as gas races away at a million mph (1.6 million km/h). Scroll down for video . Scientists at the American Astronomical Society in Seattle revealed their new findings for the Eta Carinae system (illustration shown). Located 7,500 light-years from Earth it consists of two starts in orbit. One is three times the size of the other and they pass every 5.5 years . The latest work by researchers at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland was presented at the American Astronomical Soceity's (AAS) 225th meeting in Seattle this week. Astronomers are trying to learn more about the two stars in the Eta Carinae system and how they interact with each other. The heavier of the two stars is quickly losing mass through wind streaming away from its surface at over a million miles per hour. It is still losing mass at a rate that will add up to the sun's mass in about a millennium. Though smaller than its partner, the companion star in Eta Carinae is also massive, weighing in at about 30 times the mass of the sun. It is losing matter at a rate that is about a hundred times lower than its partner, but still a prodigious weight loss compared to most other stars. Known for its surprising behaviour, Eta Carinae is a system of two stars that erupted twice in the 19th century - for reasons not understood. Eta Carinae is located about 7,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Carina. The system is surrounded by the vast Homunculus Nebula, which gives it its odd shape. Its two massive stars are in eccentric orbits, which brings them unusually close every 5.5 years - to roughly the distance between Mars and the sun. When this happens, it appears that the smaller star carves out a path in the gas emissions of the larger star. The point of closest approach also co-incides with a drop of X-rays in the stars. X-rays are produced when their winds come into contact head-on in space, being heated to millions of degrees. But these drop during closest approach, perhaps because the smaller star is within the envelope of the larger one. And it also appears structural changes are taking place in the system each time they pass one another. Known for its surprising behaviour, Eta Carinae is a system of two stars (illustration shown). Ever 5.5 years they reach their point of closest approach, 140 million miles (225 million kilometres) from each other, which is roughly the average distance from Mars to the sun in our own solar system . Both produce powerful gaseous outflows called stellar winds, which enshroud the stars and hamper efforts to directly measure their properties. Astronomers have established that the brighter, cooler primary star has about 90 times the mass of the sun and outshines it by 5 million times. While the properties of its smaller, hotter companion are more contested, the researchers think the star has about 30 solar masses and emits a million times the sun's light. At closest approach, known as periastron, the stars are 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) apart. The last time this occurred was in August 2014. In the months either side of periastron, astronomers have noticed dramatic changes in the system. These include X-ray flares and 'a play of light and shadow' as the smaller star swings around the larger one. Over the last 11 years, the scientists have been observing the system in detail with a variety of ground-based telescopes and Nasa satellites. This gif reveals a 3D model of the stars in orbit. The large red area is the gas emission by the larger star, and the blue area is that of the smaller star. As the smaller star whips around the larger one at closest approach, seen towards the end of the animation, it appears to carve a 'tunnel' through its companion's gas . The point of closest approach is normally accompanied by a drop in X-rays, which is seen here in data from observations of the stellar system. This may be due to the smaller star becoming enveloped in the gaseous emissions of the larger one - and it is often accompanied by structural changes in the system . 'We used past observations to construct a computer simulation, which helped us predict what we would see during the next cycle, and then we feed new observations back into the model to further refine it,' said Thomas Madura, a Nasa Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard and a theorist on the Eta Carinae team. According to this model, the interaction of the two stellar winds accounts for many of the periodic changes observed in the system. The winds from each star have markedly different properties: thick and slow for the primary, lean and fast for the hotter companion. The primary's wind blows at nearly one million mph (1.6 million km/h) and is especially dense, carrying away the equivalent mass of our sun every thousand years. By contrast, the companion's wind carries off about 100 times less material than the primary's, but it races outward as much as six times faster. As the stars spiral around each other, the smaller one carves out a spiral cavity in the outflow of the larger one. Both of the massive stars of Eta Carinae may one day end their lives in supernova explosions. For now, the researchers say, there is no evidence to suggest an imminent demise of either star. They are exploring the rich dataset from the 2014 periastron passage to make new predictions, which will be tested when the stars again race together in February 2020.","Scientists at the American Astronomical Society in Seattle revealed their new findings for the Eta Carinae system .

"Horror fans from around the world are familiar with the historic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. The iconic white residence inspired author Stephen King to pen his best-selling novel, The Shining, after he stayed there with his wife. The hotel further served as inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film adaptation, starring Jack Nicholson - though, interestingly, the movie's exterior shots were not filmed on site. Love 'The Shining'? The Stanley Hotel is hosting a maze design competition in homage to the classic film . A stay at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, inspired Stephen King to write the frightening novel . However, that doesn't stop them from playing the film on loop on channel 42 of the hotel's guest room TVs. Now, to celebrate 20 years of new management, the hotel has announced a unique public competition, which will attract aspiring designers and movie lovers alike. Amateur (and professional) designers have been called upon to design a 61,500 sq foot hedge maze, as seen in several of the film's pivotal scenes, to serve as an homage to the horror classic. The maze was featured prominently in the movie, despite not actually having been filmed on site in Colorado . 'There are few hotels in the world that share a history and story as unique as that of the Stanley Hotel,' said John W. Cullen, owner of the property. 'I am thrilled to share this special moment in my life and the hotel's history. 'We have built this place together over the years and I'm excited to invite everyone to be a part of its legacy through this special design contest.' The maze will be comprised of 1,600 to 2,000 Alpine Currant hedge bushes and will be featured prominently on the hotel's picturesque front lawn. The winning design will be constructed on the hotel's picturesque front lawn for all to see . A ribbon-cutting for the maze will take place on the opening night of the 3rd annual Stanley Film Festival on April 30, 2015, following the selection of the winning design by a special panel of Estes Park residents, Stanley Hotel employees and film festival staff. Winner will have their name placed on a recognition placard in the centre of the maze. More information, as well as requirements and guidelines, are available on the hotel website. All designs must be submitted by midnight on January 31, 2015.","Colorado hotel hosting public competition to design 61, 500 sq ft maze .

"Bucharest residents witnessed night transform into day after a meteor was seen blazing through the the sky. At 3:05am local time, several security cameras throughout the Romanian city captured the incredible sight of the space rock lighting up the area. The flash lasted for several seconds, with locals expressing their shock at the eerie glow which engulfed parts of the capital. At 3:05am local time, several security cameras throughout the city captured the incredible sight of the space rock lighting up the area. This image was captured by a NXDATA-2 rooftop security camera . The Romanian Space Agency (Rosa) said the event was caused by a meteoroid entering the Earth's atmosphere and was recorded at an altitude of 31 - 43 miles (50 – 70km). A rooftop camera from surveillance company NxData showed the transformation, while another camera revealed lights as seen from the Otopeni airport in Bucharest. It's unknown whether this meteoroid survived its entry into Earth’s atmosphere to leave debris on and become a meteorite. Rosa claims the most likely scenario is that it burned in the atmosphere without causing any damage to surrounding buildings. Every day, more than 40 tonnes of meteoroids hit our atmosphere. A space rock lights up the streets in Romania. It's unknown whether this meteoroid survived its entry into Earth’s atmosphere to leave debris on and become a meteorite . Bucharest witnessed night transform into day after a meteor was seen blazing over the Romanian capital . Many are tiny specks of comet dust that crumble harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere, producing a slow drizzle of meteors in the night sky. An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets. If the fireball is travelling slow enough, and makes it low enough, it is possible that it can survive to the ground as a meteorite. Last year, an incredible animation for MailOnline was unveiled that lets you scroll and zoom around the world as meteorite impacts from recorded history unfold before your eyes. The map was created by data journalist Simon Rogers, and shows where asteroids have impacted over the last thousand years. Scrolling around the world, you can see where some of the biggest hotspots are. And it also highlights how vulnerable our planet is to asteroids. Nasa estimates that just one per cent of the millions of asteroids in our solar system have been found. But, although you can see recorded impacts on land in these animations, most asteroids that encounter Earth either explode in the atmosphere or land at sea. This means the vast majority are unrecorded and, as we don't know the location of every asteroid in the solar system, we're not sure when one will next hit. Rosa claims the most likely scenario is that the meteoroid burned in the atmosphere without causing any damage to surrounding buildings .","A meteor was seen streaking through the skies at 3:05 am local time .

Officers confirmed that they had spoken to the parents and were considering charges for allowing the boy to drive the vehicle while under age. The youngster's mother dispatched him to collect his father after she was told he had passed out . A police spokesman said: 'The child drove a total of 20km to bring his father home. His father was incapacitated after a night of drinking with friends at a bar near his place of work.' The legal age for driving in China is 18 although in many rural areas it is largely ignored as children help parents with farm work and often drive farm vehicles similar to the three-wheeled truck. The images sparked widespread criticism of the father, but praise for the seven-year-old boy's driving skills.","Jun Yu sent to pick up his drunk father after he passed out near work place .

"Tourists from Saudi Arabia are the world’s biggest spenders when they head abroad, splashing more £14bn  every year, according to government figures. The wealthy Gulf country says at least 4.5 million Saudi tourists take at least one holiday each year and they spend as much as six times as Western holidaymakers, Al-Sharq reported. The announcement comes after an unrelated global study found that holidaymakers from Saudi Arabia spend an average of nearly £4,500 per getaway - the most in the world. London's designer shops are a popular destination for Saudi Arabia's wealthy holidaymakers . A family from Saudi Arabia strolls along a picturesque beach in the state of Penang in Malaysia . Saudi Arabians were followed by Australians (£2,700 per trip) and Chinese travellers (£2,540). With so much money being spent abroad Saudi Arabia is now looking at ways to develop its tourism industry to lure foreign visitors and entice its own residents to opt for a staycation and spend money at home. Khalid Al-Dughaim, secretary general for the Saudi Commission for Tourism, told Al-Sharq that the kingdom has not realised the full economic potential for tourism as the industry is still relatively new compared to other Gulf and Arabian countries, and does not receive full financial support. Saudi Arabia is now looking at ways to develop its domestic tourism industry to keep money at home . Looking to Dubai as a ‘perfect example’, he said: ‘The tourism industry is looking at tackling the obstacles it has in order to enhance its services. ‘The travel agencies, tourism agencies and the activities we offer nationally must be re-evaluated. ‘Development of the tourism industry will enrich regional income and enhance the attraction of the country’s landmarks and history. It will also create job opportunities for many job-seekers.'","Gulf country says its residents spend as much as six times as Westerners .

"A father whose weight ballooned to 22st, prompting teenagers to shout ‘fat git’ at him in the street, has managed to lose nearly 9st in a year thanks to a smartphone app. Chris Angel, 46, had become so overweight one night he was convinced he was having a heart attack, as his diet of fried foods, takeaways, dessert and beer had left him in poor health. He suffered crippling back pain from the strain of carrying his large stomach around, and couldn’t walk for longer than 15 minutes without getting out of breath. After doctors warned he was on the brink of type 2 diabetes, had high blood pressure, and faced a lifetime of medication, he decided to lose weight. Scroll down for video . Chris Angel, 46, saw his weight balloon to 22st (pictured left with his daughter) after he moved to America and ate a diet of junk food, takeaway and beer. He managed to lost almost 9st in a year through using a smartphone app (pictured right after his weight loss) The wake up call to lose weight came when Mr Angel woke up in the night terrified he was having a heart attack. After carrying out tests, his doctor warned he was on the brink of type 2 diabetes . Mr Angel stumbled on a smartphone app which allowed him to keep a food diary and tot up his daily calories. After swapping takeaways and dessert for chicken and broccoli, he slimmed down to 13st (pictured) He stumbled across a smartphone app which allowed him to keep a food diary and count the calories he was consuming daily, so he could cut down and lose weight. He swapped takeaways and beer for chicken and vegetables, and started going to the gym and doing long walks. Within a year he had lost nearly 9st (57 kg), and weighed a slim 13st (83kg). Mr Angel, who lives in Woking, says the call to action to lose weight came one night when he woke up at 3am with terrible chest pain. He said: 'I was utterly convinced I was having a heart attack. Instead of calling an ambulance, I got up, walked around and went back to bed until it stopped. 'The next day I went to the doctors and they told me I had heart palpitations, which weren't life threatening. 'They were deeply unsettling and uncomfortable to experience. 'I thought “if that's what heart palpitations feel like, what would a heart attack feel like?” After a series of tests, the doctor told him he had high blood pressure, and was pre-diabetic. BEFORE . Breakfast: Eggs on toast . Biscuits . Lunch: Burger and chips or fish and chips or a cheese toastie . Dinner: Takaway - usually a double cheese and pepperoni pizza, an Indian, Chinese or Italian and then ice cream or another dessert . Couple of beers . Diet Coke throughout the day . Exercise: None . AFTER . Breakfast: 50g porridge . Lunch: Raw broccoli, raw carrots, sandwich thins with ham . Dinner: Chicken breast (192g) and boiled leeks, roasted carrots parsnips and vegetable oil. Exercise: 35- 40 mins in gym before work and a 7 mile walk on the weekend. 'My GP gave me a brutal choice: take medication to control my blood pressure and the possible onset of type 2 diabetes – or lose a lot of weight. 'I didn't want to face a life on medication, and ultimately my life expectancy could be affected if I carried on the way I was. 'I had a word with myself and said 'Look sunshine, you're going to be 45 and it's not going to get easier to lose weight. ‘You've got a choice between eating yourself into a coma or doing something about it.' Mr Woking says he was born overweight and then gained weight after moving to America, where he said eating large portions and doing little exercise was the norm. He said: 'I was born in 1968 quite heavy. I was consistently on the heavier end of the scale all my life. 'In 1988 I moved to the U.S. and everything they say about the American diet is true. 'You can put on a stone in a holiday. If you go there for 15 years and you don't pay any attention to what you're eating, you can put on a lot more.' He said the culture in Florida, where he was living, was to eat out. 'I was getting takeaways three times a week, lots of restaurant eating. 'I was eating fried foods, pizza, ice creams. All the things I like but probably shouldn't eat. 'And in America, you don't go walking, you drive everywhere.' Over the next two decades, he piled on the pounds. Noticing this, he tried a range of diets to lose weight. 'I would go on a diet every few months, but wouldn't stick to it. Weight watchers, Atkins, juice diets, fasting diets. When he was overweight, Mr Angel said he suffered aching joints, headaches from the high blood pressure, and he couldn't walk further than 15 minutes. He had to buy his clothes from special 'big and tall' shops . 'Every six or eight months there was a new fad diet and I'd try it. 'But because my weight was not stopping me having a career or raising my child, it just never seemed like a priority. 'I can honestly say I was never embarrassed about my weight – which is probably a bad thing as it meant I was fat for so long.' By New Year's Day 2013 he weighed 22st, his heaviest weight ever. By this point he was suffering serious physical discomfort as a result of his body fat. 'There is aching knees, they used to grind. My ankles that would twist and I wouldn't be able to walk. 'Then, a constant aching back, and headaches from the high blood pressure.' He said he didn't realise at the time, but looking back he believes he was depressed because of his weight. 'Kids in the street would say 'look at that fat git' and what could I say? They weren't wrong.' 'I had to do my clothes shopping in what I call 'big and tall shops' where I couldn't get fashionable clothes. It didn't feel great.' When he started suffering heart palpitations so bad he thought he was going to die, and doctors warned he faced a lifetime of health problems, he knew it was time to act. He began to research ways of losing weight and stumbled across the Nutracheck website and phone app. Now he has lost weight (left), Mr Angel enjoys going on 7 mile walks at the weekend. He can buy clothes from 'normal' shops like Debehams (his old trousers are pictured, right) He kept a food diary on the app, and it calculated all the calories in the food he was eating, so he could keep a check of his total consumption. He set himself a goal of getting down to 16 stone (104.5 kg) by December 2014, but by June had already smashed his target. He said: 'I harnessed my drive, I always wanted to be able to win and be on top of any situation. 'I took my business background and I said 'how can I make this into a competition? By doing all of those things I was able to spur myself on. 'That's where Nutracheck came in - I could count calories and say 'I did not hit the no I wanted to hit today, I can do better tomorrow.' He swapped takeaways for lean meat and vegetables, started walking and going to the gym, and within a year he had lost almost 9st (57kg). Nutracheck is an app that allows people to keep a food diary and tot up their daily calorie intake via a picture database of over 160,000 UK foods. It allows users to scan in the barcode of a product, or enter it manually, and it will calculate the amount of calories in it. Nutritional advice and support is also available. The Nutracheck team has released a version of the App specifically for the USA. For more information visit www.nutracheck.co.uk . 'My top tips are really simple: buy a digital scale to weigh what you eat – don't guess! And just be honest, which means logging everything you eat and drink. 'If you try to guess what 100g of something looks like you are likely to underestimate – so just get used to weighing your portions accurately and noting it all down. 'You learn tricks as you go along so you never feel hungry. Like swede doesn't have a lot of calories, but if fills you up. 'So I eat some swede and then I can save more calories for chicken, which I love.' Today, he weighs 13st (83kg). His blood pressure has stabilised, he is no longer prediabetic and he is determined to maintain this healthy weight. He says he is now able to exercise and buy fashionable clothes. 'I would think nothing of walking to the shops now. My idea of a recreational walk is six milew, before it was six feet,' he said. He says he has also found experienced the joy of buying fashionable clothes. 'I've replaced my clothes with things that are more my style – I can go to normal shops where there's more choice now. 'I went to a 'big and tall' shop without thinking recently to buy a golf shirt and they said 'We can't help you. You're too small for us'. 'And they sent me to Debenhams. It was great.'","Chris Angel, 46, put on weight while living in America for 20 years .

"Being a worrier is a sign of high intelligence, according to a team of researchers from Lakehead University in Ontario. Picture posed by model . They are mocked for their frequent fretting but worriers may have the last laugh. Research suggests that being a worrier is a sign of high intelligence. Those who live in constant fear they won’t get everything done and who can’t switch off worrisome thoughts are more articulate. In tests, worriers scored higher in something called verbal intelligence – the ability to understand and work with the written and spoken word. The Canadian researchers said there are clear advantages to being a worrier. The team from Lakehead University in Ontario put 125 students through a battery of tests. This included measures of depression and shyness and a test of verbal intelligence. The verbal intelligence test looked at vocabulary, as well as the ability to categorise words and to understand proverbs. The men and women also filled in a ‘worry questionnaire’ which asked them how much they agreed with statements such as ‘I am always worrying about something’ and ‘I have been a worrier all my life’. Those who admitted to worrying a lot also tended to do better on the test of verbal intelligence – at least when their worries about the experiment itself was taken into account. The researchers said that taking the time to anticipate and plan for potential threats could have helped our ancestors survive. After all, it is better to be overly cautious and live than be too confident and then be struck down by disease or killed by a wild animal. Writing in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, they said: ‘From an evolutionary standpoint, there are fewer costs associated with worrying about a threatening event that does not occur than failing to anticipate, plan for and avoid one that does.’ Scroll down for video . In tests, worriers scored higher in something called verbal intelligence – the ability to understand and work with the written and spoken word (posed by model) However, worriers can’t relax. The study also found links between high verbal intelligence and depression. What is more, the men and women who found it hard not to replay past events in their heads and think ‘what if?’ scored poorly on a test of non-verbal intelligence. This involved completing a series of geometric puzzles and is a measure of observational skills, problem solving ability and abstract reasoning. The researchers said it is possible that those who are good with words find it easier to think in detail about past and future events – raising the odds of them being worriers. In contrast, those with good observational skills may live in the moment and be better at making judgements as things happen and so have less need to dwell on them later.","Canadian researchers found worriers scored higher in verbal intelligence .

"Ten Queensland police officers arrested a man wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' T-shirt in Brisbane this morning. Police alleged the 44-year-old man, who has been named as Iain Fogerty, was being a 'public nuisance' and was 'being disruptive to people' in Fortitude Valley, around 8:30am. Labor campaigners said he was simply smiling and waving while standing next to Liberal Party campaigners and posing for photographs. 'We thought it was really funny,' a Labor source told Daily Mail Australia. 'Next thing, all these cops arrived. Off you go, mate: Ten police officers swooped and arrested this 44-year-old man this morning . Labor campaigners said the man was standing among Liberal National Party campaigners, smiling and waving when he was arrested . However, Liberal campaigners said he was acting aggressively prior to the arrest. Above, the man is being bundled into the back of a van . 'We asked the police what happened and the police said he was being arrested for public nuisance, which was really strange.' 'We've been really concerned about him ever since'. Luke Barnes, a Liberal National Party worker, told the Brisbane Times the man had been acting aggressively. 'One of their supporters came over to our side and got quite aggressive and intimidating with our members,' he was quoted saying. Thousands of police officers recently took to the streets of Brisbane as part of a major security operation for the G20 Leader's Summit . Mr Fogerty was expected to receive 'watchhouse bail' this afternoon and face court on February 4. Speaking of the arrest, a Queensland police spokesman insisted: 'It didn't have anything to do with the shirt.' But social media erupted in mockery over the arrest, with many punters taking aim at the apparently draconian measure and #ImWithStupid trending nationwide. 'Man arrested at a campaign event in Qld, wearing 'I'm With Stupid' t-shirt... thus getting the campaign officially underway,' quipped Tim Callanan.

"Chinese civilisation is traditionally said to have originated in central China, by the Yellow River, when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region around 4,000 years ago. But a separate, complex society may have originated around 2,400 years earlier in the north-east of the country and gradually spread south, a study has suggested. Until now the Hongshan culture had not been credited as being the source of Chinese civilisation because it was understood to have been a small, remote and self-contained culture miles away from the river. Chinese culture and civilisation is traditionally said to have originated by the Yellow River (pictured) when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region, but new research suggests a complex civilisation not only originated around 2,400 years earlier, it may have been rooted across Inner Mongolia instead . The first evidence of the Hongshan culture, including pottery and jade, was found in the Chifeng Shi region, north of Beijing. The middle reaches of the Yellow River is often referred to as the ‘cradle of Chinese civilisation’, where the country’s complex culture began. The Hongshan culture predates the Xia Dynasty by 2,400 years. But, it is not credited as being the source of civilisation because, until now, it was thought to have been a relatively small, remote culture miles away from the river. In particular, the first evidence of the culture, including pottery and jade, was found in the Chifeng Shi region, north of Beijing. Hongshan is known for carved artefacts, jade dragons and clay figurines. The discovery of such artefacts in Hunshandake suggests the culture was more wide-reaching and complex than first thought. But researchers from the Institute of Geochemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences wanted to see if the culture spread more widely. In an attempt to discover more about the little-known people, the team studied sediment and desert lands in Hunshandake, in Inner Mongolia. The area is approximately 185 miles (300km) from where the first Hongshan discoveries were made and is part of China’s desert belt - a region of arid and sandy landscapes. During the dig, archaeologists found evidence of Hongshan pottery and stone artefacts suggesting the region once housed a large population of Hongshan people. This suggests the culture was far more wide-reaching than first thought, and may have been more complex. The team also studied environmental changes over the past 10,000 years by analysing patterns and depressions in the sand dunes. Researchers studied desert lands in Hunshandake, Inner Mongolia (pictured). The area is 185 miles (300km) from where the first Hongshan discoveries were made and during the dig, archaeologists found evidence of Hongshan artefacts suggesting the region once housed a large population of Hongshan people . The team also studied environmental changes  in Hunshandake (illustrated) and found the area was once covered in rivers and lakes, making it ideal for the Hongshan people to live. However, when this water dried up the Hongshan people may have migrated and played a formative role in setting up Chinese civilisation . It discovered the area was once covered in rivers and lakes, between 5,000 and 9,000 years ago, and birch and spruce trees would have lined these waterways. This would have made it an ideal environment for the Hongshan people to live. However, this water dried up and the area became more arid around 4,200 years ago. The experts speculate that this could have forced the Hongshan people to leave the area and migrate south towards the river, meaning they may have played a formative role in establishing Chinese civilisation. Hongshan is known for carved artefacts, jade dragons (example pictured) and figurines. The discovery of such artefacts in Hunshandake suggests it was more wide-reaching and complex than first thought . ‘For the first time to our knowledge we present a case of desertification mainly triggered by changes associated with climate change,’ explained the researchers. ‘Our research on the interactions in the Hunshandake suggests Chinese civilisation may be rooted in the marginal areas in the north, rather than in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.’ The study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. During a separate dig, Chinese archaeologists unearthed relics of musical instruments from a complex of tombs in Zaoyang city, Hubei. A stringed instrument, known as a Se, and a frame to hold chime bells were among the items excavated from the grave site. The Se is said to be the earliest ever found in China and will help expert study the musical development from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Warring States Period.","Studies have found Hongshan culture predates Xia Dynasty by 2,400 years .

"Surviving relatives of Holocaust victims who stashed treasured possessions before being sent to Auschwitz and their deaths have been tracked down in Australia. Little more than a week after MailOnline highlighted the find in Slovakia, Eva Wittenberg, daughter of the only surviving member of Samuel Gottschall's family and her brother, Alex Gottshall, were tracked down in Australia. She described the discovery of the items as 'miraculous'. On December 31, MailOnline revealed that the personal belongings, including jewellery boxes and family photos, were found in the city of Presov in Slovakia. Family: Eva Wittenberg (left) and Alex Gottshall (right), granddaughter and grandson of Jewish Rabbi Samuel Gottschall (pictured in frame with his wife Rebbetzin Eva Gottshall), who stashed belongings in an attic in Slovakia before being sent to their deaths . Survivors: Rabbi Benjamin Gottschall (left) and Jana Gottschall (right) pictured in 1969. Benjamin was the only surviving son of Samuel who moved to Australia after the war but died of cancer in Sydney in 1978 . Discovery: More details of the life of Benjamin Vojtech Gottschall (left) was revealed after his family was tracked down . Descendants: The surviving relatives of Jewish Rabbi Samuel Gottschall will soon receive the items discovered in the attic in Slovakia. Pictured are Eva and Alex's children and grandchildren . Hidden treasures: Cutlery, photographs and documents were found in the house in Presov, Slovakia, by a handyman fixing the roof . Haunting: This photograph was found in the stash of personal belongings of the Gottschall family . Handyman Imrich Girasek was fixing his neighbour's leaking roof when he made the discovery in a dim and damp attic. Speaking from her home in Sydney, Mrs Wittenberg, 66, said: 'It was like getting a message from heaven – as if we were making contact with our grandparents and uncles and aunts and cousins that we have never known, because they were all murdered at Auschwitz. 'It was like a miracle. We are overjoyed that the things were found, it's beyond description really.' Alex added: 'On the other hand, we are pained and sad about the immense suffering of our family that it brings back.' Mr Girasek found the items next to suitcases from the period, which he believes had been looted. He carefully leafed through the documents and photographs – among them wedding pictures and family portraits – but was not able to identify the people in the pictures. Mr Girasek gave the items to the city's Museum of Jewish Culture with the hope the family could be identified and relatives located. Following research, it was believed the items belonged to the family of Jewish Rabbi Samuel Gottschall. Mr Gottschall, born in 1878, was deported to the concentration camp in 1942 along with his entire family. It is thought the items were hidden before their deportation. Poignant: These family photos were taken before the deportation of the city's Jews began . Discovered: The photographs found in the Presov home are now known to belong to Mr Gottschall's family . Discovered: This document, believed to feature college graduates, includes a photograph of a man with the surname Gottschall . Mrs Wittenberg is the granddaughter of Samuel Gottschall and daughter of his only surviving child, Benjamin Vojtech Gottshall. Since the haunting discovery featured in an MailOnline article on December 31, Mrs Wittenberg has been tracked down and she and her family have been overwhelmed with kind messages from people who had read the story. 'We have received emails from all over the world, from as far away as Tennessee and California and from all over Australia,' Mrs Wittenberg said. 'They have asked if we are connected to the discovery that appeared.  People have been very kind, and we want to thank MailOnline for caring about this miraculous discovery. 'It means a lot to us, and it would have made my father very happy to know that the world has been told that there once was a good man named Samuel Gottschall who lived with his family in Presov and was killed during the war.' Samuel Gottschall, his wife, four children and two grandchildren all died at Auschwitz before the end of the Second World War, as did the entire extended family. Only one Gottschall family member was still alive when the Red Army liberated Auschwitz in the spring of 1945 - Benjamin Gottschall, the father of Mrs Wittenberg and her younger brother, Alex Gottshall (the C was dropped from the surname by the family in Australia). Benjamin was serving as a rabbi in the Slovakian city of Louny when he was captured and deported in late 1941. Family portrait: These smartly dressed subjects are thought to be connected to the Gottschall family . Treasured: Now the memory of the well-respected family can live on in the hands of their descendants . Discovery: This was another of the documents found between the roof beams . Unassuming: The stash was found in the attic of this house, built next to the Neolog synagogue . Slovakia, an ally of Nazi Germany, played a very active and unflattering role in the Holocaust. Anti-Semitic sentiments ran every bit as deep in the small Central European state as in neigbouring Germany, and the ruling national-conservative and Catholic-based Slovak People's Party, which took over shortly before the outbreak of World War II, eventually went as far as paying Germany to help empty the country of its Jewish population – the 'alien element' and 'permanent enemy of the state', s Interior Minister Sano Mach described the ethnic minority in a speech. In 1941, Slovakia's government introduced the Jewish Codex, a large catalog of paragraphs which effectively stripped the Jewish community of all civil rights and means of providing for itself. This was, however, only a first step on the way to achieving the end-goal. In February 1942 Prime Minister Voytech Tuka declared that Slovakia would deport 10,000 to 20,000 young, strong men from Slovakia's Jewish population to Germany as part of a deal to provide workers to the Nazi regime. Before the first transport even took place, however, Slovakia's government had convinced Germany to help make the country entirely free of Jews. According to the new deal, Germany would take all Slovakian Jews and guarantee that no-one ever returned, while Slovakia agreed to pay Germany 500 Reichsmark for every person deported. The Vatican, among others, officially protested the plan, but the Slovak government remained hard. 'We shall not stop this action under any circumstance,' the interior minister made clear. 'There is no foreign intervention which would stop us on the road to the liberation of Slovakia from Jewry,' Sano Mach declared in a radio address on April 1, 1942, four days after the first deportation train containing 999 Jewish women had left the Slovak city of Poprad with Auschwitz as destination. Before the war, some 136,000 Jews lived in Slovakia. Today, merely 4,000 people of Jewish descent are registered as living here. Historical sources estimate that as much as 80,000 Slovak Jews were deported to concentration camps during ther war. In Presov, the third-largest city in Slovakia, the numbers are staggering: Some 6,000 Jews were deported from Presov to concentration camps between 1942 and 1945. Only 800 people returned to the city after the war, many of which later emigrated, among them the father of Mrs. Wittenberg and Mr. Gottshall. His parents assumed him dead and marked it with a one-week mourning period - yet he would be the only one of a large family to be alive after the war. He continued to perform secret religious services for his fellow prisoners in Theresienstadt concentration camp and later Auschwitz. His wife died in the death camp Bergen-Belsen. Benjamin also dedicated the remainder of his life to religion and community work. 'Our father made a promise to God while he was in Auschwitz that he would spend his life as a communal rabbi in small Jewish communities where he was most needed,' said Mr Gottshall. 'That was one of the things that kept him going – and he also kept his promise.' Benjamin remarried after the war and served as rabbi to fellow Holocaust survivors in Prague, before emigrating to Australia. He arrived in Melbourne in 1949 with his pregnant wife and a baby - Mrs Wittenberg. Benjamin mourned the loss of his three brothers, his sister and parents all his life, his children say. He marked the birthdays of his siblings every year, but otherwise he and his wife, who also lost her entire family, never spoke much of the horrors they experienced. 'They were positive people who also taught us to have a positive approach to life,' Mrs Wittenberg said. For that we are grateful and admire them.' Newspapers: Clippings from Hungarian papers were among the items hidden in the home . Manuscript:Samuel Gottschall's music. Now his great-grandchildren can perform it . Benjamin died of cancer in Sydney in 1978, at the age of 71. His life story has been well documented, and the Jewish museum in Prague is planning to run an exhibition about him. The photographs and personal belongings found in Presov will form part of the display. Mrs Wittenberg and her brother are waiting to receive the package from the Museum of Jewish Culture in Presov, where the discovered items have been stored. They are most excited about a book full of sheet music composed by Rabbi Samuel Gottschall, who also led the choir in the local synagogue and composed religious music. 'My oldest son is a wonderful singer and also leads a choir in a synagogue here in Sydney,' Mrs Wittenberg added. 'It will be a very special experience to hear him perform the music of his great-grandfather.' Slovakia had been an ally of Nazi Germany and the country supplied it with workers. However, when it fell short of the promised numbers, it agreed to replace the shortfall with 10,000 to 20,000 deported Slovak Jews. Before the war, some 136,000 Jews lived in Slovakia, but now there are only about 4,000. In Presov, the third-largest city in Slovakia, some 6,000 Jews were deported to concentration camps between 1942 and 1945. Only 800 people returned to the city after the war and many of them later emigrated, often to the US, Australia, Israel and the UK.","Family in Australia of Samuel Gottschall were contacted by people worldwide who had read MailOnline story .

"Like her sister, the Duchess of Cambridge, sporty Pippa Middleton is no slouch when it comes to getting fit. Now the 31-year-old has revealed that she is to take part in the London to Brighton bike ride in June in a bid to raise money for the British Heart Foundation. The event, which is now in its 40th year, sees 25,000 cyclists descend on the seaside city each summer and has raised a total of £65m for the charity so far. Scroll down for video . She's all heart! Pippa Middleton will be taking part in the London to Brighton bike ride in June . Speaking at the launch, Pippa described herself as a 'keen cyclist' and said she would be taking part in the 54 mile ride herself. 'As a keen cyclist, I am thrilled to be involved in this milestone year of the London to Brighton Bike Ride,' said the 31-year-old. 'This event is testament to the fact that cycling is such a great inclusive sport that everyone can enjoy and at the same time, through the money raised, it continues to help millions of people affected by heart disease. 'Whether you want to ride as part of a team or go the challenge alone, registration opens on Saturday 17th January so sign up. I look forward to seeing you all at the start line in June.' The London to Brighton Bike Ride was launched in 1975 by street performer Robert Stredder and his partner after they decided to organise a bike version of the London to Brighton car rally. Ambassador: The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister is a supporter of the British Heart Foundation . Sporty: The 31-year-old, seen here with her stockbroker boyfriend, says she is a 'keen cyclist' Active: Favourite sports include tennis (she is pictured here at Wimbledon), running and skiing . Since then, the event has expanded from 36 riders in the first year to more than 25,000 cyclists and is now the oldest and largest charity bike ride in Europe. 'The London to Brighton Bike Ride has gone from being a jaunt down to the seaside for a group of friends, to an event which people have on their bucket lists,' added Tristam Jones, Head of Events at the BHF. 'Whether people take on the ride as a one off challenge or come back year after year, what is unchanging is the unity and commitment we see every year from thousands of people willing to helping others. 'We’re very proud of what this ride has achieved and thank all of those who have played their part.' Pippa has long been a supporter of the heart health charity and last year raised £15,000 after taking part in a fundraising bike ride across the US. She is also an official ambassador for the charity - a role that she has added to her work as a columnist, author and editor of Party Pieces in-house title, The Party Times. In her most recent column for Vanity Fair, she discussed another of her favourite sports - skiing - and listed her favourite resorts in which to indulge. Marathon: Last year, Pippa took part in the 26-mile Engadin Ski Marathon in Switzerland's St Moritz . Passion: She also used her last Vanity Fair column to discuss her love of the sport - and her favourite resorts . Among her favourites was Verbier, unsurprisingly also popular with the Royal Family and close to Geneva where her stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson now lives. 'Come wearing either a party hat or powder skis; there's never a dull moment at this resort,' she writes about the Swiss resort. 'Verbier is for serious skiers who love off-piste and moguls,' she adds. 'On-piste skiing here isn't too challenging.' Indeed, Prince Andrew, his daughter Prince Eugenie and Prince Harry's former girlfriend Cressida Bonas were pictured enjoying a weekend getaway at the Swiss resort. The family were happily ensconced in a luxury £22,000-per-week chalet when news of sex abuse allegations levelled at the prince were revealed. Top choice: Pippa, seen here in St. Mortiz, chose that resort as well as Switzerland's Zermatt and Verbier . Loved: Another favourite is the Austrian resort of Lech which she often visits with boyfriend Nico Jackson . Ms Middleton, who was not staying with the royals at the time, began writing for Vanity Fair in June 2013 and is widely known to be a skilled and enthusiastic skier. She has even competed in a number of cross country races at some of the very resorts featured in her recent column. In March 2013, the socialite and her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson took part in the 26-mile Engadin Ski Marathon in Saint-Moritz, Switzerland, alongside Ms Middleton's younger brother James. The following year the couple slowed things down a bit in order to enjoy a more relaxed getaway in Lech Am Alberg, Austria. Both resorts are included in her Vanity Fair piece .","Pippa Middleton helped to launch the London to Brighton bike ride .

"This hilarious video shows the moment a mother and her four children were left to deal with a wolf spider hiding in their curtains. The two-minute clip shows Jennifer Marlowe, 27, waving a broom at her drapes and trying to bat the spider out of the window as one of her three daughters films the hysterics in their Vancouver home. Daughters Madison, nine, Hailey, seven, Sophia, seven, and son Aiden, three, are heard screaming in the background, while their British Bulldog T.J. barks to add to the pandemonium. Jennifer Marlowe's children filmed as she tried to bash a wolf spider out of her home in Vancouver . The mother-of-four, who is clearly scared of spiders, hit the curtains with a broom as she tried to knock the arachnid off . One daughter can be heard giving instructions to Mrs Marlowe on how to deal with the spider, suggesting that she knock it on to the floor so they can use a vacuum cleaner to suck it up. Halfway through the chaos, one of the Marlowe girls, from Vancouver, turns the phone camera used to film the uproar around to film herself, explaining that they 'are recording this of a spider - a wolf spider'. The arachnids, which can grow to up an inch-and-a-half in size, are known for their aggressive behaviour when threatened and can grow to up to four inches in size. The spiders, which can bite but are not considered dangerously venomous, are common in Vancouver - but not in the Marlowe's seventh-floor condo, it seems. After two minutes of bashing the spider with a broom, it falls to the floor, causing the family to scream. The girls, and even Mrs Marlowe, let out piercing screams as they clamber on to a bed and scarper from the room. Just after one of Mrs Marlowe's daughters (left) explains what they are doing, the spider drops to the floor and the family run from the screaming (right) While the spider appears to have made an escape, man of the house Tim Marlowe revealed that it was caught before long. He said: 'Jen sprayed the spider with spider spray, and it ran and hid. The next day she found it dead in the bathroom - another large event at my house.' He also assured MailOnline that that he and Aiden are not scared of spiders.","Hilarious video captures moment mother and four children took on a spider .

"Tragic: Brendan Jordan, seven, was killed when a folding table fell on his head in the school gym . A seven-year-old boy has died after an 108-pound folding table fell out of a wall in school gym and struck him on the head. Brendan Jordan, a third-grader at New Milford's Gibbs Elementary School in New Jersey, was playing soccer with other children at Berkley Street Elementary School on Wednesday evening when he neared a fold-down table and benches, which are stored in the wall. It is not clear if the boy started touching the table, which is attached to two benches and flips vertically up into the wall for storage. Authorities do not know if it had been correctly locked. The table fell and one of the benches, which is made of wood and steel, hit Brendan on the side of the head and he collapsed, theNorth Jersey Record reported. The team's coach Bryan Mone, who is also a New Milford police officer, immediately ran to the boy and performed CPR as others contacted 911. But the youngster was pronounced dead around 7.30 p.m. at Hackensack University Medical Center, according to Detective Lt. Frank Ramaci. Ramaci called the death 'an unimaginable tragedy'. The tables and benches are secured with a key but School Superintendent Michael Polizzi told The Record that he didn't know if it had been locked properly. Freak accident: The folding table fell out of a wall at Berkley Street Elementary School in New Milford, New Jersey, pictured, on Wednesday afternoon and struck him on the side of the head . He said the tables have been in 'good working condition,' and the school has never had a problem with them since they were installed about 11 years ago. 'It's a tremendous loss for all of us, a shock for the family especially,' Polizzi said. 'I can't imagine the void the family will feel.' Brendan was part of the indoor soccer team and was practicing for his Sunday season opener with six other seven- and eight-year-old children when he was struck. John Bigger, the recreation director for New Milford, said practices in the gym were suspended for a few days while it is inspected and he doesn't know if the team will play Sunday. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warned in 2012 of the potential safety risk of the tables, saying it had received reports of several deaths and injuries in schools when the tables tipped over. Contraption: The folding table was like the one pictured above. It is attached to two benches and folds up vertically into the wall. When the table fell, Brendan was hit by one of the 108-pound benches . It warned that most accidents happened during afterschool or during nonschool activities and warned schools to not allow children to move the tables or play with them. Police from New Milford and the Bergen County Sheriff's Department crime scene investigation unit are looking into the boy's death. Grief counselors have been made available at both schools. 'Our hearts go out to Brendan's family who are dealing with this tragedy,' Ramaci said.

"The wife of 'Great Escaper' D-Day veteran Bernard Jordan has died just days after her husband. Irene Jordan, 88, died on Tuesday evening, a week after her husband who famously slipped away from his care home to attend last year's 70th anniversary D-Day events in France. He died in hospital aged 90  - six months after he captured the nation's hearts when he travelled across the channel to Normandy wearing his war medals and grey mac. Scroll down for video . Irene Jordan (pictured), 88, died on Tuesday evening a week following the death of her husband, Bernard . Bernard Jordan, a former Royal Navy officer, married his wife Irene in 1946 - she died a week after him . A statement from Amanda Scott, managing director of Gracewell Healthcare which runs The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex, where the couple lived, confirmed Mrs Jordan's death. It said: 'Irene and Bernie will both be much missed by everyone at the home and our thoughts and prayers go out to their friends and family at this sad time.' Brighton and Hove mayor Brian Fitch paid tribute to Mrs Jordan. He said: 'They were a very close couple who will both be sadly missed. 'Irene went into the care home first after Bernie had looked after her at home, so it came as a bit of a shock that he died first. 'They had been married for more than 50 years and were a devoted couple. After he had gone, she probably gave up the will. 'They were religious people who are now reunited together.' Bernard Jordan, the 90-year-old war veteran who broke out of his care home in East Sussex to attend the D-Day commemorations in Normandy, France, died last week. His wife Irene died on Tuesday night . The war hero sparked a nationwide search after escaping from his care home and sneaking to France for the Normandy commemorations. He was later applauded for his escapade and received a welcoming return . Just weeks later, on his 90th birthday, the former Navy officer was inundated with gifts, including more than 2,500 birthday cards from around the world. At the time, he said: 'I'm just one man and I'm nothing special' Mr Jordan, a Royal Navy veteran and former mayor of Hove, hit headlines around the world when he disappeared from the care home the couple lived in on June 5 last year. His whereabouts was only uncovered when a younger veteran phoned later that night to say he had met Mr Jordan and he was safe. He was later inundated with more than 2,500 birthday cards following his adventure to Normandy. A month after his escapade in France, Mr Jordan was made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove during a reception at Brighton Town Hall. The honour, which saw him join a select band of more than 30 men and women since 1997, was to mark his 'exceptional contribution to the work of the newly-formed Brighton and Hove Council and the former Hove Borough Council and to the community'. A ceremony celebrating Mr and Mrs Jordan's lives will be held at All Saints Church in Hove on January 30 followed by a private funeral, Mr Fitch said. A minute's silence will be held at the next full meeting of Brighton and Hove City Council to remember the couple.","Irene Jordan, 88, died on Tuesday evening, a week after her husband .

"Two children have been stung by a potentially lethal jellyfish at a beach in Western Australia - marking a possible change in the seasonal migration of the deadly fish. The children were rushed to hospital for treatment after being stung by a Irukandji jellyfish at Honeymoon Cove near Pilbara. The jellyfish sting is so strong it leaves victims in such severe pain that experts say it makes people feel like they're dying. It comes after a mother and her six-year-old son were also stung swimming at Wellington Point beach in Brisbane on New Year's Eve. Two children have been stung in Western Australia by the Irukandji jellyfish - it delivers a potentially fatal sting that sparks a surge of adrenalin, driving up the heart rate and prompting a feeling of impending doom . Raelene Murphy and her young son Sebastian both suffered excruciating pain and thought they were dying when they were stung in a separate incident in Brisbane last week . The Irukandji, native to northern Australia, delivers a potentially fatal sting that sparks a surge of adrenalin, driving up the heart rate and prompting a feeling of impending death. ‘After a delay of a varying number of minutes, you will start to feel totally nauseous. You experience chronic cramps and spasms, vomiting, and a feeling of impending doom-you feel like you're going to die,' marine biologist and jellyfish researcher, Lisa-Ann Gershwin, told Daily Mail Australia. The location of the latest reported sting shows a change in their seasonal migration, according to Ms Gershwin. 'There has been a spate of stings in Moreton Bay in Western Australia. There has been more stingings in West Australia than North, which is quite out of the ordinary,’ she said.

'I took off my reef shoes and pulled the tentacles off my feet,' Ms Murphy told Daily Mail Australia. She said her son must have walked straight into the creature as he was only about a metre away from her in the water as he walked towards his mother after she was stung. 'I asked people nearby to take care of Sebastian and make sure he was OK because I was having problems breathing and I had pains in my chest,' Ms Murphy said. American researcher Lisa-Ann Gershwin displays a deadly species of Irukandji jellyfish. Two children have been stung this week by by Irukandji  at a beach in Western Australia . The mother of two was convinced that she was having a heart attack as the unbearable pain spread to her lower back, legs and arms. 'I thought I was dying and my son said he thought he was dying too,' she said. 'The first ambulance took my son who was vomiting, frothing at the mouth and his lips had turned blue.' Sebastian needed three shots of adrenalin and one shot of morphine before being monitored in hospital for the night. His mother received two shots of morphine in order for the excruciating pain to subside. This week, two children have been stung by Irukandji jellyfish at a beach in Western Australia . Gershwin said the location of the tiny fishes, which are generally one cubic centimetre in length, shows a possible change in their seasonal migration . The sting can also cause hypertension and soaring blood pressure-even in those who don’t suffer from high blood pressure normally. This is the symptom which can have fatal consequences, as in the case of the two recorded irukandji deaths. ‘As long as those who are stung can receive immediate treatment-which includes the application of vinegar to the sting site-then patients are usually fine,' Ms Gershwin said. 'It’s the remote fishermen or swimmers who are a worry. Often, the symptoms of a irukandji bite cannot be detected afterwards, so there is likely much more deaths that have gone unrecorded.’ Ms Gershwin recommends speaking to lifeguards, either on the beach or on a hotline, to check if the beach has had an influx jellyfish of late. 'I also encourage wearing full body stinger suits during jellyfish season to eliminate the threat of being stung,' she said.","Two children were stung by a Irukandji jellyfish in Western Australia .

"Budget retailer Aldi has won yet another supermarket battle after it was revealed to have the cheapest typical shopping basket. A snapshot of a 15-item groceries in the UK today has revealed a £6.83 difference between the cheapest and the most expensive supermarket. Aldi offered up the best deal at £14.75, at £1.87 less than its closest rival Asda, according to the comparison made using the mysupermarket.co.uk website. The boost for the budget supermarket follows the launch of supermarket price war this week after Asda and Sainsbury's announced £450million in price cuts to stop millions of customers leaving for Aldi and Lidl. Scroll down for video . A snapshot of a 15-item grocery basket in the UK today has revealed a £6.83 difference between the cheapest and the most expensive supermarket (pictured) And this was despite every grocer other than Aldi having either one or two items missing because they were 'unavailable'. Tesco's basket came in at £17.87 followed by Waitrose (£18.82), Morrisons (£20.10), Sainsbury's (£20.21) and Ocado (£21.58). A selection of 15 standard grocery items such as milk, eggs, sliced bread, bananas and fish fingers were compared using Aldi as the baseline retailer. Aldi offered up the cheapest basket at £14.75, at £1.87 less than its closest rival Asda, according to the comparison made using the mysupermarket.co.uk website . Ocado was the most expensive shopping basket, coming in at £21.58 for the 15 basic shopping items (stock picture) This resulted in every one of the 15 items being included from Aldi, but the final tally showed Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Ocado had two missing items and Waitrose and Sainsbury's had one missing item. 4 pints of semi-skimmed milk . 6 large free range eggs . 1 loaf of Kingsmill 50/50 medium sliced . 1 pack of large vine-ripened tomatoes . 350g of medium cheddar cheese . 250g salted butter . 1 bunch of organic fairtrade bananas . 4 x 125g Optifit fat free yoghurt . 900g frozen peas . 10 pack of fish fingers . 1 whole fresh broccoli . 500g of penne pasta . 500ml of washing up liquid . 500ml of antibacterial handwash . 9 toilet rolls . The figures follow Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's announcing major investments in price cutting this week alone, while Morrisons has claimed an industry first by promising to match the discounters on price. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Ocado all have price comparison schemes which gives shoppers money back vouchers if they could have bought their basket for less elsewhere. But Aldi has never made any such pledge, instead focusing on expanding its product lines and catering for increasingly middle-class tastes, stocking everything from lobster to jodhpurs and skiwear. The UK supermarket sector has undergone tumultuous change in the last two years, with little in the way of good news for the middle-market Big Four. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have lost market share for the first time in a generation as customers depart in their droves for discounters Aldi and Lidl and the upmarket Waitrose and Marks & Spencer. Gilad Simhony, chief executive of comparison website mysupermarket.co.uk, said middle-market supermarkets had struggled with the challenge of finding their niche while trying to offer low prices and quality. He said: 'The supermarket industry has definitely become more competitive over the last couple of years. Cutting prices: Asda (pictured) said  it is ploughing £300million into price cuts in the first three months of this year in an effort to catch up with the budget supermarkets . Sainsbury's (pictured) have also announced major investments in price cutting in this week alone . 'The response from many of the supermarkets has been to tighten their brand proposition and be more precise in their offering. 'Supermarkets such as Aldi and to a certain extent Asda have focused on being the best value and cheapest products. On the other scale, retailers such as Waitrose have focused on quality.

'Those supermarkets in the middle have struggled more as they overcome the challenge of providing the lowest prices but the highest quality. 'Over the next 12 months we would expect retailers to sharpen their brand positioning as the competition to retain loyalty becomes even harder.' Aldi and Lidl have continued to attract increasing amounts of shoppers, albeit at a slower rate, suggesting that fierce price cutting by rivals may be beginning to have an effect. Giles Hurley, joint managing director of corporate buying at Aldi, said the company was unconcerned about 'temporary price reductions from other retailers'. 'As a discounter, we will never be beaten on price and it is consistent everyday low pricing that is driving Aldi's success.'

"The Canadian parliament's hero Sergeant-at-Arms is soon to get a major promotion after bravely leading the charge against House of Commons shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in October. Ex-Mountie Kevin Vickers will move on from the already prestigious, though ceremonial, job as parliamentary head of security to become top diplomat to Ireland. Vickers will end a 35-plus year career as a mountie and security officer to become ambassador, CBC reports. Promotion: The hero Canadian parliamentary Sergeant-at-Arms will be given the position of Ambassador to Ireland following a selfless show of bravery in which he took down House of Commons invader Michael Zehaf-Bibeau . Vickers will be replace former Conservative MP Loyola Hearn, who's held the position since 2010, according to the Globe and Mail. It's yet another in a string of honors the hero has received following his selfless act of bravery October 22. Israel's parliament officially honored Vickers in November. And the MPs in his own House of Commons gave Vickers a touching standing ovation that was recorded and played countless times around the world in the wake of the shooting and showed the policing veteran nearly in tears. At first expressionless and motionless, the 58-year-old Vickers eventually responded to the ovation with a few slight nods of his head, his lips quivering with emotion. Later in the session, Prime Minister Stephen Harper lauded Vickers, whose job — a mix of the ceremonial and the practical — encompasses the maintenance of safety and security in the Parliament complex. 'I would be very remiss if I did not conclude in acknowledging specifically the work of the security forces here on Parliament and the great work of our sergeant-at-arms,' Harper said to more cheers and applause from the members. Harper then walked over to shake Vickers' hand and clap him on the shoulder. Riveting footage: Vickers led the way as officials chased down terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on after he murdered an army reservist and entered the House of Commons building . Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms . 'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday's events,' Vickers said in a statement. 'However, I have the support of a remarkable security team,' he added. 'Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage. I am grateful and proud to be part of this team.' The gunman who invaded Parliament had been seen by witnesses minutes earlier fatally shooting a soldier posted at the nearby National War Memorial. As shots rang out in the Parliament building, people fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament. Video broadcast showed Vickers moments after the gunfire, walking down a corridor in the Parliament building with a handgun in his right hand. Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioner Bob Paulson said at a news conference that Zehaf-Bibeau and Vickers exchanged gunfire, and the suspect was shot as he moved from behind a pillar to get a better shot at the sergeant-at-arms. 'Mr. Vickers and his whole team are heroes,' Paulson added. Vickers, whose background includes providing security for visiting members of Britain's royal family, became sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied security career. He spent nearly 30 years with the RCMP, reaching the rank of chief superintendent. Gunman: The gunman who invaded Parliament, identified as petty criminal Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, had been seen by witnesses minutes earlier fatally shooting a soldier posted at the nearby National War Memorial. Innocent victim: Nathan Cirillo, 24, was the soldier shot dead in the October terror attack on the Canadian Parliament complex in Ottowa . A member of Parliament from Ottawa, Paul Dewar, described the 6-foot-4 Vickers as 'a gentle giant,' and recalled how the sergeant-at-arms had scooped Dewar's young son into his arms at their first encounter. Dewar said that when Vickers interviewed for the job years ago, he had stressed the importance of striking a balance so that Parliament would be secure yet remain accessible to the public. 'He said, 'I want to make sure people are still able to play Frisbee on the front lawn,'' Dewar recalled. Daryl Kramp, a Conservative member of Parliament from Ontario, said he counts Vickers as a personal friend, as well as a consummate professional. 'He does his duty in just such a manner that he had earned the respect of all of the House, prior to these events,' Kramp said. 'And then to be able to act so professionally again, and so decisively, in a traumatic situation, that just even gives more credence to not only what his capabilities are, but certainly to what his values and principles are.' A former RCMP deputy commissioner, Pierre-Yves Bourduas, who also has security duties at Parliament Hill, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that Vickers was a meticulous planner. Vickers was born in New Brunswick and spent much of his police career there. His son, Andrew, has carried on the family tradition as a police officer in Miramichi, New Brunswick. Three years ago, Andrew was lauded in the federal Parliament for diving into the frigid, fast-flowing Miramichi River to rescue a drowning woman who was trying to kill herself. 'We are happy to see Andrew following in the footsteps of his dad,' said the lawmaker who saluted him, Tilly O'Neill-Gordon. Heartfelt: he MP in the House of Commons gave Vickers a touching standing ovation that was recorded and played countless times around the world in the wake of the shooting and showed the policing veteran nearly in tears.","Kevin Vickers, 58, the country's parliamentary head of security, famously brought down invader Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on October 22 .
The ex-Mountie gained worldwide notoriety after leading the charge against Zehaf-Bibeau and won a standing ovation at the House of Commons .
While his role in parliament was largely seen as ceremonial, his new job as top diplomat to Ireland is a very real reward for Vickers' bravery ."
"A budding 16-year-old fashion designer says the Oakland A's  stole his 'stOAKed' logo and used it to sell t-shirts for the baseball team. Ryan Frigo, a proud Oakland native, says he created the logo more than two years ago as part of a high school design class. He's been selling t-shirts, hoodies, beanies and other products with the design ever since. 'I created this company to combat negative perceptions and promote Oakland in my freshman year at Oakland Tech,' Mr Frigo told KNTV. Ryan Frigo says he designed the 'stoaked' logo in 2012 to help foster pride his native city of Oakland, California . The A's started selling their own 'stoaked' shirts last month - though the team has since pulled the merchandise from its online store . Mr Frigo, pictured, says the A's either deliberately stole his idea or thought they could get away with taking his design because he's just a teenager . Last month, the Atheltics online store began offering t-shirts that said 'STOAKED'  - printing the 'oak' in the world in Athletics yellow. The shirts were meant to celebrate the teams' post-season run last season. After Mr Frigo's story was picked up by local news media, the company that manufactures the shirt, Majestic, announced it would stop selling the shirts 'as a gesture of goodwill.' Since 2012, Mr Frigo has been selling his 'STOAKED' clothing that similarly emphasized the 'oak' in the word. He does not have a trademark on his clothing because the word 'stoked' had already been trademarked by someone. Mr Frigo argues that he has a 'common law trademark,' however, because he has been using the term for years. He thinks that A's willfully disregarded his prior use of the term. 'Maybe, they saw it was an Oakland youth who doesn't have a huge corporation like them and said, ""Oh we can probably get away with using it,""' he told the East Bay Express. On his blog, he wrote: 'Even if it was a coincidence, any professional is expected to, at the least, Google ""stoaked."" If they had done so, this website would have come up first. Either they directly stole from stOAKed, did not bother to do a second's research, or did not think twice about infringing on the company.'","Ryan Frigo designed the 'stoaked' logo for a high school class in 2012 and began selling clothing with the word .

"Wendy Bell is one of three women accused of fleecing a 92-year-old widow out of £500,000 . Unqualified carers stole more than £500,000 from a 92-year-old widow by ‘grossly’ overcharging for poor service, a court heard. Wendy Bell, 57, and Amanda Carroll, 44, set out to ‘milk’ Audrey Hammond, who has Parkinson’s disease, of every penny they could, it is alleged. They charged up to £121 an hour for round-the-clock care, roping in friends and family to help and taking over Mrs Hammond’s Grade II-listed home in a Yorkshire village. They even ran a burger van business from the property, Bradford Crown Court heard. Computers were bought for staff, carpets were damaged, and expensive cars parked outside. Wendy’s daughter Lisa Bell, 30, once arrived late for a morning shift in a BMW, still wearing full make-up, a mini-skirt and high heels. Another time she was found sleeping as she sunbathed while on duty, the court heard. Mrs Hammond’s late husband amassed a ‘considerable fortune’ in his coal merchant business and left her land and fishing rights in the Yorkshire Dales. But the carers siphoned off hundreds of thousands by overcharging, putting in fake petty cash claims and claiming for ‘ghost’ workers, the jury heard. Wendy Bell and Carroll ‘thought they were utterly untouchable’ and used a number of bank accounts for ‘money laundering on a substantial scale’, said prosecutor Stephen Wood. The Bells and Helen Banks, 42, deny conspiracy to defraud. Wendy denies two other fraud offences. Carroll, Alice Barker, 59, Linda Mynott, 60, and Caron Gilbert, 32, admit conspiracy to defraud. Carroll admits two more fraud charges. Mr Wood said the case ‘is all about greed’, adding: ‘These defendants … breached the trust reposed in them to simply milk from that lady over half a million pounds by grossly over-claiming for work. ‘Mrs Hammond was subjected to a cruel and heartless fraud.’ Mrs Hammond was diagnosed with debilitating Parkinson’s some years ago. She gave power of attorney to her solicitor, Myron Handzij, allowing him to write cheques on her behalf. She was initially cared for by her niece Anne Murgatroyd, a retired nurse. Wendy Bell was hired via a care agency to help. Helen Banks (left) and Lisa Bell (right) are also accused of conspiracy to defraud the vulnerable pensioner . Amanda Carroll, 43,  previously pleaded guilty at Bradford Crown Court to being involved in the scam . In 2006, Mrs Murgatroyd fell ill and Mrs Hammond hired Bell and the others full-time at £8 an hour, paying them directly to avoid giving the agency a cut. Wendy Bell took a lead role in arranging the cover, the court heard. Mr Handzij was then asked to pay the inflated wages. ‘All requests for payment were met, regrettably it seems without question,’ Mr Wood said. Not one of the carers Wendy Bell recruited was qualified to look after a Parkinson’s patient. None of them had a contract, were legally registered, had any Criminal Records Bureau checks done or paid tax on their wages. Alice Barker (left) and Lynda Mynott (right) have already admitted conspiracy to defraud . When a qualified carer, Vanessa Ingham, did a shift at the house, she was shocked to find no care plan or medication chart. In one year, Wendy Bell earned £54,600, while Carroll’s £75,600 pay was at a rate of £121 an hour. When police first investigated in September 2012, the group were charging Mrs Hammond £35,000 a month. That fell to £20,000 as soon as an agency took over. Wendy was allegedly overpaid £138,620 from 2010 to 2012, while Carroll took £225,850. ‘The idea that these monies were genuinely earned or reflect actual earnings is preposterous,’ Mr Wood said. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Carers stole £500,000 by overcharging widow Audrey Hammond, court told .

"The British nurse fighting for her life after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone could remain in a critical condition for 'some time', her family said today. Pauline Cafferkey was diagnosed with the deadly virus following her return to Glasgow from Sierra Leone. The 39-year-old had been a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town. She is currently being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. Today, her relatives said in a statement: 'We would like to thank all our friends, family and the members of the public who have contacted us with support following Pauline's diagnosis with Ebola. 'We have been very touched by the kind words. Scroll down for video . Pauline Cafferkey, Britain's latest Ebola victim, remains in a critical condition at London's Royal Free Hospital where she is being treated by doctor Michael Jacobs - and may do for some time, her family said today . 'Pauline continues to be in a critical condition at the Royal Free Hospital. We want to thank all the staff caring for her for their kindness, support and compassion. 'Pauline's condition could remain the same for some time and we would again ask for her and our privacy to be respected.' Ms Cafferkey was diagnosed with Ebola following her return to Glasgow from Sierra Leone where she had been a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town. The 39-year-old is currently being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. The nurse was admitted to an isolation facility at the Brownlee unit in Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, at 8am on December 29. After a blood sample tested positive for Ebola, she was transferred by military plane to the Royal Free Hospital the following day. Her condition deteriorated in the new year and remains critical. At the Royal Free, where fellow nurse William Pooley recovered from Ebola this year, she is in a cocooned bed in an isolation ward where medics treat her wearing protective suits. However one expert believes Ms Cafferkey has just a 50/50 chance of survival. Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist from the University of Reading, said the experimental drug ZMapp used to treat nurse William Pooley at the same hospital would only be available sometime this month. It is therefore down to Pauline Cafferkey's 'genetics' as to whether she would pull through, he said. Ms Cafferkey is currently being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in north London . But with the experimental drug ZMapp used to treat nurse William Pooley (pictured) at the same hospital unavailable, it is now down to her 'genetics' as to whether she would pull through, one expert said . Praising her efforts in fighting the deadly disease, he said: 'She's a hero. Nurses in particular are at the highest risk because they've got to deal with bodily fluids which are full of the virus. 'They're brave, they're great and I'm glad they are helping sufferers in Africa.' He added: 'At this point it's about a 50/50 chance that she makes it. 'People in the West have a better survival rate than in West Africa - it's something like 1 in 4 who died in comparison to about half or even three quarters in African hospitals. 'There's very little medical science can do to change the outcome. We don't have any sure fire answers to Ebola. 'Some people will be resistant, other's won't. A lot of it depends on genetics.' He added: 'A large part of Ebola is essentially your own immune system beating you up. The longer that goes on, eventually you get blood leaking out and then it's over. 'Prolonging it longer is a good thing so the body can build up antibodies but reducing the severity of the virus is the key thing. 'You can kind of tell at this point what is going to be the outcome. Ms Cafferkey left Sierra Leone  on her long journey back to Glasgow via Casablanca and Heathrow . 'The clinical team will have a pretty good idea by this point. They'll be able to tell by seeing the virus levels in her system. 'ZMapp is a combination of three antibodies, little sticky things that are in people's blood. 'They ran out of this. They were supposed to be ready around the beginning of January - they must be close to being ready. 'I haven't heard anything about it recently. We don't know what the drug they are using to treat her is.' Speaking of the international response to the outbreak he said: 'Ebola has dropped out of the press but is killing about 50 people a day across the globe. 'It's not as serious as it was but it has killed off a lot of people.' Save the Children has launched an investigation into how she was infected but admits it may never establish the exact circumstances. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Ms Cafferkey 'continues to receive the best possible care'. The decision by Heathrow officials to wave Miss Cafferkey through even though she said she felt ill sparked the search for 203 people who may have had contact with her on two flights . With more health workers due to return to the UK from Sierra Leone in the next two weeks, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged: 'We will keep all of the procedures under review. 'It is important that we learn lessons from the case of Pauline Cafferkey and that we learn lessons from any other case that might arise. 'I hope there are no other cases identified in Scotland or the UK but it is likely we will see other cases, a small number of additional cases, and we need to keep learning from the experience of dealing with them.' Yesterday a person with a 'history of travel to West Africa' tested negative for Ebola after being placed in isolation at a Welsh hospital. The person, who has recently returned from an area of West Africa affected by the virus, was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff after developing a fever. A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: 'Public Health Wales can confirm that an individual tested for Ebola earlier today at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital does not have the disease. 'There may be other explanations for their symptoms for which tests are already under way. Earlier this week, a Briton who was feared to have the deadly virus tested negative for Ebola at Swindon hospital. The negative case follows two suspected patients last week - in Cornwall and Aberdeen - who were also confirmed not to have the virus. The first safety trial of an experimental preventative Ebola vaccine also began this week at a British university. The Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adults by the end of this month. Developers of the drug, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, have now accelerated it due to the continued spread of Ebola in West Africa. Ebola has so far killed 8,153 people and infected 20,656 in the past year, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures.","Pauline Cafferkey, 39, was diagnosed after returning from Sierra Leone .

"A KFC branch and other restaurants were forced to close at a food court in the Plaza Norte shopping centre in Lima, Peru, after a dramatic video emerged of a rat running loose. The footage, shot late last month by one of the customers, shows the crowd screaming and running as they noticed the rodent searching for scraps under the tables. A man who appears to be part of the security staff tries to stamp on the rat but fails. The rat proved a crafty customer as it scurried around searching for chicken and chips in the KFC . The filmer, Julianna Cadillo, later wrote online that there had been two rats but she'd only captured one on video. According to local media Jose Miguel Garcia, Ministry of Health spokesman, said they ordered the closure of a KFC branch in the food court and other restaurants in the Plaza Norte after the incident. Customers in the KFC restaurant in Lima screamed and leapt on chairs and tables as the rat ran amok . A security guard attempts to stamp on the rat, although this would ahve probably put even more off their food . Allegedly the restaurant has been fined as the rats pose 'a threat to sanitary conditions for humans.' Thomas Casares Orozco, 24, who was at the restaurant, said: 'I was eating with my girlfriend when she screamed and jumped up pointing out the rat, then everyone started running for it scattering food everywhere. 'One rat tried to grab a chicken leg but when a security guard turned up it tried to run off. 'There was chaos as people made off or climbed onto chairs and tables. I saw one bloke stamp on a rat but it didn't seem to stop it - it ran under a flower box and I didn't see it again.' This video footage of the rat rampage in the shopping mall, called the Plaza Norte that covers 200,000 square meters, quickly went viral. The mall is considered one of Peru's biggest with 14 movie theaters, dozens of restaurants in the restaurant area and a fun park for kids. But the rat proved too quick for the security man's foot, and scurried off to terrorise more people . Facebook users were outraged by the appearance of the rodent but some of the netizens took it with humour and made jokes about the incident. 'They are training rats, they wanted to show us what they can do', said Anoesis Afer, one netizen. But others were less amused: 'It is disgusting. I would not eat in that place ever', said another user, Paz Mendez. The video was shared by netizen Julianna Cad who said: 'There were actually two rats, but I only managed to record one of them.'","Rodents spotted scurrying around in food court in Lima shopping centre .

"David Cameron will travel to Paris on Sunday to attend a 'unity rally' with other world leaders following the spate terror attacks which have rocked France over the last three days. The Prime Minister said he had accepted an invitation from President Hollande to celebrate 'the values behind Charlie Hebdo'. It comes after French commandos simultaneously stormed a grocery store in Paris and printing firm outside the capital where three terrorists were  holed up - killing all the Al Qaeda fanatics. David Cameron will travel to Paris on Sunday to attend a 'unity rally' with other world leaders . The Prime Minister said he had accepted an invitation from President Hollande to celebrate 'the values behind Charlie Hebdo . The 'unity rally' is set to take place at around 3pm on Sunday at the Place de la Republique in central Paris. Mr Cameron and other world leaders will go to the Elysee Palace first, before joining the rally. Mr Cameron's decision to attend the rally on Sunday comes after security chiefs warned that Britain was also being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. Warning: Andrew Parker (pictured), the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later . The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need . He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Armed British police patrol St Pancras station in London, where the Eurostar train runs to Paris . Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.' Patrols stepped up:  Armed British Transport Police officers stand next to the Eurostar platforms at London St Pancras railway station . There is also growing concern about the threat posed by ISIS fights returning to the UK. Radicalisation expert Shiraz Maher this morning told the BBC's Today programme that strict blasphemy laws in Muslim countries abroad were inflaming tensions in the West. He said stricter controls on what could be said about Islam and the prophet Muhammad 'affect some European Muslim's tolerance of satire'. Earlier, the Today programme heard from a number of British Muslims in High Wycombe who expressed anger at the journalists Charlie Hebdo for lampooning Islam. One Pakistani gentleman, Sajjad Haidyer, told the programme that the murdered journalists were 'not innocent'. He said: 'If the people make his cartoons or something else, they are hurting my heart. You can insult the peoples, you can insult me, you can insult anybody else – but not god, not the prophet Muhammad – we are not allowing that. 'If they are doing that, that will happen again and again.' He added: 'Some of these people were not innocent. The editor who makes the cartoons. He has no right to make cartoons or the prophet. He has no right to say Islam is bad.' Another elderly Muslim man said: 'Democracy doesn't mean you can go and insult anybody. Insulting somebody, you shouldn't allow that. What are they achieving with the cartoon – what is the point?' But another man in the town said people did not have the right to take people lives. 'What Islam means is peace, love,' he said. Prince Harry has paid his respects to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre by signing a book of condolence at the French embassy. Harry added his name to a growing list of signatures from leading figures who have expressed sympathy for the 12 people gunned down by attackers who targeted a satirical magazine based in Paris. London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May have already signed the book set up at the embassy in London for national figures.

A picture shows the message and signature written by Britain's Prince Harry in a book of condolence . Members of the public have been leaving messages of support in another book opened at the French Institute. When Harry first arrived at the embassy in Knightsbridge he was greeted by Sylvie Bermann, France's ambassador to the UK. Ms Bermann ushered him in to a room where the book of condolence was opened on a large table next to colour photographs of all the victims. The table also displayed the slogan Je suis Charlie, adopted worldwide by supporters of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, and a bouquet of roses left by the London Mayor. Harry, dressed in a suit and tie, wrote the brief message 'With warmest best wishes' above his name. As the prince and the ambassador left the room, they chatted briefly, and in a possible reference to the two Islamist militants suspected of the Charlie Hebdo attack who are holed up in a building outside Paris, Harry said: 'I'm sure it will come to an end soon.' The Queen has already sent a message of condolence to France's president Francois Hollande in which she expressed her 'sincere condolences' to the families of those who were killed in the attack. After the prince left, the ambassador said: 'For us, it's very important to have the support of the Royal Family. 'We were very moved by the support of Her Majesty the Queen and then the prince. It shows the solidarity of the British people and British Government and Royal Family (with us).'","Prime Minister reveals plan to join President Hollande in Paris on Sunday .

"Classroom assistant Rachael Regan (pictured appearing at Bradford Crown Court) was spared jail today after she taped a 7-year-old to her chair and shut her in a storeroom . A classroom assistant who carried out a five-month campaign of bullying against a seven-year-old pupil who was taped to her chair and shut in a storeroom has been spared jail. Rachael Regan 'singled out and bullied' the girl at a primary school in the Calderdale area of West Yorkshire, a court heard. Regan's trial last month was told about a catalogue of incidents against the pupil, who is now nine. They included sticking Post-it notes to her thumbs, tying her shoes on with string, calling her a nickname, goading her with a biscuit, hiding her doll and tearing up her photograph. Other children in the class laughed as the girl was subjected to the supposedly 'good-humoured' pranks by Regan. Today, at Bradford Crown Court, the 43-year-old was given a community order including a requirement to do 40 hours of unpaid work. Judge Neil Davey QC  spared her jail after he criticised the length of time the classroom assistant had spent on bail before she was charged while the Crown Prosecution Service  decided what to do. He added the wait was a punishment in itself. Regan, of Illingworth, West Yorkshire, was found guilty of child cruelty after the trial, which finished last month. A teacher colleague, Deborah McDonald, 41, was cleared of the same offence. Today, Judge Davey said to her: 'You have been convicted by a jury of cruelty to a small child, in effect of bullying her to the extent that it would properly be described as cruelty.' He said her conduct had been 'shameful' and a breach of trust. The judge said: 'You breached that trust by turning her into a figure of fun.' He said Regan invited others to ridicule the girl when she taped her to a chair. Judge Davey said the defendant had already lost the job she loved and would be barred from working with children. 'You have lost your job, and lost your good name. 'Having humiliated the girl, you have been professionally humiliated and now publicly humiliated.' Regan has been placed on the Barred List preventing her working with vulnerable people. The judge added: 'You were cruelly bullying her. Any such conduct by an adult would be shameful, made more shameful because your victim was only seven years old and in your care. 'She came from a challenging home environment and you were trusted to look after her. 'You betrayed that trust by turning her into a figure of fun by taping her to a chair and inviting children to look at her and laugh at her.' Judge Davey said the girl had now recovered from her ordeal and was 'back to her old happy, bubbly, extrovert self'. He pointed out that the allegations were made in January 2013 but Regan was not charged until last April. He told her this period of 'legal limbo' she lived through was 'substantial punishment' as she lived for months with the uncertainly of not knowing whether she would eventually face prison. Judge Neil Davey QC at Bradford Crown Court (pictured) spared Regan jail after he criticised the length of time the classroom assistant had already spent on bail before she was charged . Prosecutor Simon Waley told the week-long trial last year that an investigation was launched by the school and the police after the girl told her mother about the incident. The 7-year-old girl had came out of school at home time in a distressed state before telling her mother she had been fastened to the chair with Sellotape by a teacher and could not move for about ten minutes. The teaching assistant later said that she did it for 'a bit of fun' because the girl had been 'fidgety', the court heard. Mr Waley said: 'She said that the class had been laughing at her and that she was the 'class clown'.' Mr Waley said: 'She said that Mrs Regan put it all around the chair and it was hard breathing. 'She said that she couldn't get out to reach her things. She said that the whole class were laughing.' The girl's mother said the moment her daughter told her a teaching assistant had taped her to a chair was 'heartbreaking'. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the jury the young girl 'clung' to her 'for dear life' with tears streaming down her face after the incident. Mr Waley told the trial that the girl also said to police that Regan bound string to her legs and feet to keep her pumps on. He added: 'She said it was horrible and that, again, everybody had been laughing.' The girl told police that Regan put Post-it notes on to her thumbs when she had been sucking them and shut the door to a store room, leaving her on a chair inside. Other children had been given biscuits for good homework, the court heard, but she was left out and she was told her how delicious they were. The alleged bullying took place between September 2012 and January last year. Other staff members at the school told police they had witnessed some of the incidents. One support assistant said the girl's arms were 'fastened down by her sides with the Sellotape around her more than once' and said she was taped to the chair for around ten minutes. She said Regan went to another classroom to fetch another teaching assistant to show her what she had done. Mr Waley said Regan told her colleague: 'She'll not get up and wander around the classroom now.' He added that Regan had also pulled a photograph of the girl off the wall and ripped it to pieces in front of her. The court heard that the defendants denied ever bullying the girl when they were interviewed by the police and described some of the incidents as 'fun' and 'a joke'. Regan refused to answer questions today as she left court with a friend.","Rachael Regan 'singled out and bullied' the West Yorkshire primary pupil .

"Muslim community leaders have blasted a Perth preacher's 'offensive' remarks about the Paris massacre. Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad has contacted Mohammed Junaid Thorne's mother in a bid to explain that 'his comments are not helpful'. Just hours after gunmen killed 12 people at the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, Thorne, in his mid 20s, declared that insults to the Prophet Mohammed are 'not allowed' and 'very likely to stimulate some kind of response'. 'I'm very disappointed to see his comments,' Mr Trad told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've sent a message to his mum to hopefully have a chat to him and explain that his comments are not helpful. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Junaid Thorne, pictured, is a self-styled sheikh in his mid-20s. He is pictured here in front of a banner for the little known radical group, Millatu-Ibrahim . Thorne, pictured taking a selfie, grew up in Saudi Arabia with his brother, Shayden, and his father, who found a job in the country . Lecturer: Thorne claims he could recite the Koran by the age of six. He was deported from Saudi Arabia in 2012 and moved back to Perth, where his mother lives . 'My message to her was to get a word to him to ask him what is he trying to achieve. 'It's so counterproductive and offensive to the families.' Thorne also said the victims of this week's killings had failed to 'learn the lesson' of the firebombing of their offices in 2011. 'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' he wrote on Facebook on Thursday. Thorne moved to Saudi Arabia with his brother Shayden and his father, an Indigenous man of the Noongar clan, when he was nine-years-old. His father found a job in the country after divorcing Thorne's mother, a Malaysian Muslim who lives in Perth. Growing up in the devout family, Thorne claims he could recite the Koran by the age of six. However, life in Saudi Arabia was not without difficulty. Brothers: Thorne was deported for protesting the detention of his brother, Shayden (right), who was eventually granted clemency on terrorism charges in Saudi Arabia . Younger Muslim figure: Thorne told the ABC younger Muslims were often more comfortable bringing their problems to him than more senior figures . His brother was imprisoned for allegedly possessing terrorism-related material on a lap top, according to reports, and remained imprisoned for two-and-a-half years when he was granted clemency. Junaid was deported to Australia after protesting his detention in 2012. After returning to Australia, Thorne began to tour the country, delivering lectures about Islam in front of the flag of a little known radical group known as Millatu Ibrahim, which is banned in Germany. He also delivered talks about how to 'exorcise jinn' - or genies - which he said are affecting people across the country. Over the past six months, the self-styled sheikh has become a controversial figure. He branded Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' after police swooped on properties across in Sydney in September. He has been outspoken in defence of some of his associates and supporters, including terror suspects Abdul Numan Haider, 18, and Sulayman Khalid, 20. Counter-terrorism researcher Anne Aly, from Curtin University, told Daily Mail Australia: 'There's a group of young men - Junaid Thorne is one of them - they have a certain world view, a certain opinion about all this. 'They hang around together... He's in that purple circle, if you like.' Firebrand Perth preacher Junaid Thorne, who has called Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in the past, made controversial remarks on Twitter on Thursday .

Attack: Two gunman are seen facing police officers immediately during last night's dramatic events . Haider, who once attended a Thorne at the Al Furqan Centre in Melbourne, was gunned down after he allegedly stabbed two police officers outside a Melbourne police station in September. Thorne was quick to leap to the defence of his 'wonderful, practising brother', who he claimed had been 'murdered' by authorities. Daily Mail Australia photographed Thorne attending court with Khalid in October. He was charged in December with possessing documents that would allegedly facilitate a terrorist attack, which Thorne described on Facebook as 'a few incomplete sentences'. Thorne has said the Islamic State terror group does not have his full support. In an interview with the ABC in October, he told an interviewer: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them [Islamic State], I would get in trouble.' 'If I was to say that [I] don't support them at all, that would be untrue. 'I may support them [on] certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.' Preaching: Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them [on] certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.'

"The number of Geisha – traditional Japanese female entertainers who act as hostesses – may have declined since the 1800s. But more people could enjoy the company and musical skills of such hostesses, if Toshiba’s realistic ChihiraAico robot, unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, catches on. Like a Geisha, the robotic hostess named ChihiraAico is designed to make conversation, sing and could one day play classical music or look after people. Scroll down for video . The robotic hostess, named ChihiraAico, is designed to make conversation, sing and could one day play classical music or look after people. 'Her' unnervingly smooth and silent body movements are created using 43 pneumatic actuators including 24 in its shoulders, arms and hands and 15 in the face. Robotic hostess ChihiraAico (pictured) can talk, sing and gesticulate to welcome humans . The Japanese firm told Mashable that its aim is to create ‘real heart-warming communication with human-like facial expression’ with its realistic, conservatively dressed android. Toshiba claims its creation has the most realistic facial expressions of any android. 'Her' unnervingly smooth and silent body movements are created using 43 pneumatic actuators including 24 in its shoulders, arms and hands and 15 in the face. This technology is needed to reflect the robot’s emotions, as it can reportedly be happy, irritated or sad – and even cry. ChihiraAico is the latest member of Toshiba’s ‘human smart community’ – a group of robots designed to lead to smarter living. In the future, the company envisions that such robots could look after the elderly, work as nurses or waitresses, meaning that they could one day put humans out of a job. ChihiraAico is not the only android that could replace humans. Chillingly life-like robots are causing a storm in Japan, where their creators are about to launch them as actresses, full-size mechanical copies for pop idol fans, and clones of the dearly departed. There is even talk that the naturalistic, she-droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not-too-distant future. Android Asuna was a star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week showcase in November and is one of a series of 'geminoids', as their inventor dubs them, that are ripe for commercialisation say their creator robotics professor Hiroshi Ishiguro.

'She' could one day perhaps learn to play a classical instrument like a real Geisha (right) The prospect of robot overlords, friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years. But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist. This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims. A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly. This means, if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans. ‘She’ is so convincing that many people bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie at the event. While the robot currently relies on a hidden camera and a human operator to give her life, a fully independent version is expected in 10 years using artificial intelligence, face and voice recognition. Asuna has silicon skin covering animatronic muscles that move her eyes and power her expressions. 'She' has appeared on stage and in an opera and could become a pop star. Already Japan is in thrall to virtual idols such as Hatsune Miku, who is basically a hologram that 'sings' words and music created for her on a computer using 'vocaloid' technology. Her tunes often outsell those sung by her flesh and blood musical rivals in Japan. And as well as robotic news readers, realistic sex dolls are now available. Costing around £6,000, they have moveable eyes, flexible fingers and realistically textured skin. One of the manufacturers, called Orient, said: 'It is not inconceivable that we will be making android life partners in the near future.'

"As many as 11 ambulances at a time have been queuing up outside a North Wales hospital as Britain's A&E wards sink deeper into crisis. Wrexham Maelor Hospital had to cancel routine operations on other wards to deal with the huge pressure on the casualty department. Photos taken this week show long lines of ambulances queued outside the hospital, while other centres  have called in the Red Cross and others are asking fire engines to ferry patients around. An estimated 11 ambulances were seen stacked up outside Wrexham hospital on Tuesday as the crisis hitting Britain's A&E departments continues to deepen . Yesterday, seven ambulances were seen at the hospital, which has resisted the move made by 13 other centres to declare a 'major incident' in a bid to ease the pressure . Despite the scenes outside A&E, Wrexham Maelor Hospital has not joined the 13 other hospitals which have declared 'major incidents' in a bid to ease congestion. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said they were experiencing a period of 'very high demand' which was continuing to increase. Geoff Ryall-Harvey, of the local Community Health Council, said the backlog was due to changing habits among patients. He told the local Daily Post newspaper: 'There's a trend where younger people tend not to use the GPs at all. It's not good for the NHS at the moment. 'It needs to look again at how it deals with emergencies. We have got places who will have no GP at the end of this month. That will mean people will go to A&E.' A spokesman for the board in charge of the hospital said: 'Our staff are working incredibly hard to make sure that patients are getting the care they need and we can only ask for people's patience and understanding while we try to manage this difficult situation.' Meanwhile, Northern General Hospital in Sheffield has asked the Red Cross, a charity better known for helping victims of disasters in Third World countries, to operate two ambulances amid 'unprecedented pressure'. Red Cross staff were brought in to the Sheffield hospital on Tuesday to take injured people home following treatment. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We can only ask for people's patience and understanding while we try to manage this difficult situation' Northern General Hospital in Sheffield has called in the Red Cross to help in Accident and Emergency . Linda Kaye, British Red Cross service manager, said: 'Our volunteers were on hand to transport patients home from hospital in Sheffield, ensuring they got home safely and helping to reduce pressure on vital healthcare services.' Bosses at the hospital said they are experiencing a 'huge rise' in demand for emergency care, with more than 4,000 people visiting A&E in December. In an email to staff, trust chief executive Sir Andrew Cash said: 'The pressure on the emergency care system is unprecedented with A&E frequently reaching 100 people in the department and up to 50 people waiting for admission. 'December saw a 10.5 per cent increase in the number of emergency admissions compared to the previous December - an increase of almost 400 patients. The patients are also older than the usual admissions we have and many have longer lengths of stay due to their dependency and frailty.' Sir Andrew made a personal apology to patients on Friday night after some were forced to wait hours with paramedics in a hospital corridor because no beds were available. The Red Cross has contracts with a number of A&E units, including hospitals in London, Glasgow, Blackpool and Bristol - but was brought in at Sheffield amid the high pressure. A spokesman for the charity said  'Our support means we can prevent unnecessary A&E admissions by ensuring non-emergency attendees are safely transported home and given follow up support. This also prevents readmission as we ensure that the patients have everything they need at home.' Yesterday, the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firefighters – warned that staff were increasingly being relied upon to cover for ambulances. NHS trusts around the country have been forced to declare 'major incidents' as they struggle to cope . University Hospital Wales in Cardiff is one of many hospitals where ambulances have been forced to queue . General secretary Matt Wrack said: 'The public are being put at risk because the Government have cut staff, resources and equipment in both the NHS and fire and rescue service. In certain incidences, firefighters have been diverted away from their own work.' Seven hospitals remained on a status of 'major incident' last night, having declared they were struggling to cope with sheer numbers of patients arriving in A&E. Over a 36-hour period on Monday and Tuesday, an unprecedented 13 hospitals across England announced they were experiencing 'major incidents', meaning they were drafting in extra staff and cancelling non-urgent operations. Such measures are usually reserved only for events when there are mass casualties – such as terror attacks or rail crashes. And last night it emerged that another hospital was diverting mothers-to-be to a maternity unit 16 miles away because its labour ward was full of A&E patients. Weston General in Weston-super-Mare said: 'We would like to offer our sincere apologies to any women affected by this and who were referred to St Michael's in Bristol instead.' In Birmingham, the Heartlands Hospital has asked administrative staff including receptionists and office workers to help out on wards, even though they have no medical training. Figures on Tuesday showed A&E waiting times are at their worst in a decade. An overflow ambulance treatment tent in the car park of the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire . Ambulances queuing up outside the Accident and Emergency department at the Royal Bolton Hospital . The crisis has come about as many ambulance crews are queuing outside A&E – unable to drop off patients because it is so busy inside. So when another 999 call comes in, they are unable to respond. On Tuesday, an elderly woman who had fallen in the street was taken to the A&E unit at York Hospital, North Yorkshire, by firefighters passing through because the ambulance service was too busy. A paramedic later said there were queues of up to ten ambulances outside the hospital entrance. But it is not an isolated case – County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Services both responded to three emergencies instead of ambulances in December and January. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has said of the issue: 'The crisis in ambulance services means that more and more 999 calls are being attended by fire engines and police cars.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Occasionally – as has been the case for many years – fire crews stabilise patients when first on the scene of a particular incident but fire engines are not being diverted as makeshift ambulances.' The crisis is set to become a big political issue ahead of May's General Election, with Labour leader Ed Miliband accusing David Cameron of 'betraying the trust' of voters on the NHS. Mr Cameron last night criticised Mr Miliband for privately boasting of plans to 'weaponise' the health service and using the issue as a 'political football'. Jenny Knowles, who had to wait for more than seven hours to be seen by a doctor after failling and breaking her nose . Woman, 88, with broken nose made to wait 7 hours . An 88-year-old woman who fell and broke her nose had to wait more than seven hours to be seen by hospital doctors. The saga began shortly after midnight on Monday when Jenny Knowles fell at her nursing home in County Durham. Staff contacted her daughter, Gloria Wills, 66, who is an ex-chairman of the now disbanded Sedgefield Primary Care Trust. Workers at the home in West Cornforth rang 999 for an ambulance at 12.05am but Miss Wills said it was not until 3.30am before one operated by the St John Ambulance arrived and took her mother to University Hospital of North Durham. At the overstretched A&E unit, it was only at 7.15am that an X-ray confirmed that dementia sufferer Mrs Knowles had a broken nose. North East Ambulance Service said: 'We would like to apologise to the patient.' Great-gran's family gives up after 16 hours . A frail great-grandmother spent 16 hours waiting to be treated at an overstretched A&E department after a suspected mini-stroke before her disgusted family gave up. Aimee-Louise Richards said her 81-year-old grandmother, who she did not want to name, was taken by ambulance to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth last Thursday. It was for the same hospital that Florence Cunningham, also 81, had had to wait 11 hours for an ambulance. Miss Richards said her grandmother spent two hours in an ambulance outside A&E before being transferred to a second ambulance at 1am. 'It wasn't until 4am that she was even brought into the unit and put on a trolley,' she said. The pensioner was taken home at 4.30pm after the family lost patience. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust failed to respond to a request for a comment. Injured great-grandmother left lying in cold for nearly two hours . 'Real nightmare': Myfanwy Pleming was left with a chest infection after she was left lying in the cold while she waited for an ambulance following a fall . A great-grandmother says she was left outside waiting for an ambulance for almost two hours after falling on a pavement. Myfanwy Pleming fell outside her home in Saron, North Wales and broke her leg, but had to wait for one hour and 40 minutes before she was finally taken to nearby Bangor hospital. Neighbours desperately tried to keep the 67-year-old warm by wrapping her in fleeces but her condition rapidly deteriorated in the freezing temperatures. Mrs Pleming, who says she contracted hypothermia because of the length of time she waited, said: 'I was in absolute agony. I've never been so cold in all my life. 'My next-door neighbour came out to help me and phoned for an ambulance at around 4.15pm . 'My family and neighbours were doing everything they could to keep me warm.

"This is the woman at the center of the Prince Andrew underage sex storm, as she tries to go about a normal life after creating a crisis for the British royal family. Virginia Roberts was pictured on a family outing to McDonald's near her home in a small town in Colorado, where she is living with her husband and three young children. The 30-year-old mother of three claims that she slept with the prince when she was 17 and a victim of his billionaire friend Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Family outing: Virginia Roberts with one of her three children as they head for lunch at McDonald's near the Colorado home where they are now living. She alleges she had sex with Prince Andrew when underage . United: Virginia Roberts with her husband Robert Giuffre and two of their three children. She alleged in court papers filed after Christmas that she had sex with Prince Andrew three times, which he strongly denies . Determined: Virginia Roberts issued a statement through her lawyers saying she would not be 'bullied' or kept silent. She has been accused of lying by Alan Dershowtiz, the Harvard law professor with whom she claims she was forced to have sex . Since filing the allegations at a court in Florida, Roberts has been with her family in Colorado. She and Robert Giuffre, her husband of 13 years with whom she has three children, have rented a house in the countryside on the outskirts of a small town close to Colorado Springs. They have maintained a low profile and her mother Lynn and stepfather Stan Miller live nearby. None have commented. Neighbors were unaware of the family's presence in the Rocky Mountain town. One said: 'I heard about it on the news. And then I saw the girl - Miss Roberts - who lives down the track, I couldn't believe it.' Roberts is now involved in an increasingly complex legal case - and has been branded a liar by one of America's most renowned lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, who she also alleges had sex with her while she was underage. The extraordinary allegations made by Roberts are part of a US civil case against Epstein, who served 13 months in jail in 2008 for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. Roberts claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and was employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. They were introduced, she claims, through Ghislaine Maxwell.Epstein's friend. The fifth in line to the throne slept with Miss Roberts at an orgy with other under-age girls on Epstein's private Caribbean island, as well as in a private house in London and in Epstein's New York mansion, according to the court papers. The claims are denied by Prince Andrew. Meeting: This picture was taken when Prince Andrew met Roberts with his friend Ghislaine Maxwell (right) in early 2001. At the time she was 17, underage in Florida, and being paid by the Prince's friend, billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, for sexual services. The Prince denies any wrongdoing . Controversy: Prince Andrew, pictured here in Verbier, Switzerland, has been linked with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and accused of having sex with Virginia Roberts when she was a minor . Miss Roberts previously expressed her disgust at a photograph which showed the royal and Epstein walking together in Central Park after the disgraced tycoon had served just 13 months in jail . Public: Roberts disclosed her ordeal at Epstein's hands in 2011, when she lived in Australia. She has since returned to America and also accused Prince Andrew of underage sex . Roberts claims she was made to perform sex acts on Epstein. She also claimed that the first time she met Prince Andrew was at Maxwell's home in London, where she was flown at the request of Epstein. One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Maxwell looks on. Describing what happened, Roberts said Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001. They flew to Paris, then Spain, then Tangier and finally, they went to London. 'After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine's Maxwell's house' and 'was given a small upstairs bedroom,' Virginia said. She said: 'The following morning, Ghislaine came in. She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, 'Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day. We've got to go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight.' She said I needed to be 'smiley' and bubbly because he was the Queen's son. 'Ghislaine and I went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer stores where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-up,' she said. 'We got back to Ghislaine's house at around 4pm and I ran straight upstairs to shower and dress. 'When I went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door. Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. 'Ghislaine served tea from a porcelain pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's daughters. 'Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17'. The four of them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her. 'After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine's. All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted something to show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left.' Epstein was convicted in a plea bargain deal of one count of soliciting underage prostitution and is now a registered level one  sex offender after serving an 18-month prison sentence. But the scandal re-emerged as Roberts added her name to a case trying to overturn Epstein's plea bargain. Wedding: Virginia Roberts married Australian Robert Giuffre just ten days after meeting him in Thailand in 2002 . As 'Jane Doe 3' she alleged that she had been used for sex by Epstein and pressured into sleeping with both the Prince and  Dershowitz. He categorically denies wrongdoing On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Brad Edwards' Paul Cassell's - her lawyers - public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same. In a sworn statement in a Florida federal court, he denied he had sex with an underage girl on Epstein's private plane and island. Buckingham Palace has also denied the allegations against Prince Andrew. Dershowitz said the woman's claims against him are 'totally false and made up' and he is 'completely and absolutely' innocent. He said: 'I don't even know who she is,' he said of the woman. 'I've never seen her. I've never met her. I don't know who she is.' Dershowitz pointed out that the woman claims they had sex on Epstein's Caribbean Island and at his New Mexico ranch, but Dershowitz said he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter and was 'never out of the sight of my wife'. He added that the woman has also accused him of having sex with her while they were on Epstein's planes, but claims he was never on those flights. Two lawyers representing Virginia Roberts (pictured here with her husband Robert Giuffre) who claims to have had sex while a minor with prominent U.S.criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, filed a counter-defamation lawsuit against him . Outing: Other than this family trip to McDonald's, Virginia Roberts has voided appearing in public since filing the explosive claims against the prince and Alan Dershowitz, which both deny . Dershowitz called for the two men to be disbarred for their 'unethical' practice. 'They will rue the day they filed this,' he said. 'They will not get away with this. There will be legal proceedings. The truth will come out and... these two unethical attorneys will be disbarred.' They are no counter-suing him. In their lawsuit, Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz defamed them when he accused them of 'deliberate misconduct and unethical behavior warranting disbarment' during several interviews with U.S. and international media outlets. Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz made defamatory statements in 'reckless disregard' in order to support his claim of innocence. 'I'm thrilled that they sued me, because this gives me an opportunity to depose them and prove beyond any doubt that they concocted the entire story out of whole cloth and that they did not do a proper investigation and that they have falsely accused me,' Dershowitz said on Tuesday. On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Cassell and Edwards' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same . Lawyers: Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied . Dershowitz said in Monday's filing that the allegation against him was a 'deliberate lie.' He said that while he had flown on Epstein's plane several times, Roberts, named in court papers as Jane Doe #3, was not on any of those trips. He also said he had been to Epstein's island once, for a day, and was with his wife and daughter the whole time. Also on Monday, Dershowitz filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them. The women say the government's 2008 plea deal with Epstein, which allowed him to serve jail time on state charges but avoid federal prosecution, violated their rights. Dershowitz, a Harvard University professor emeritus, represented Epstein against the sex crime charges, for which Epstein served a 13-month sentence after pleading guilty in 2008.

"The door is an angry shade of purple, like every other door in the seven-storey block. It has no handle, and no name beside the buzzer – just a heavy lock, and spyhole for checking out unwelcome callers. The building is a vast and seemingly impenetrable concrete warren divided into some 600 apartments – or perhaps ‘boxes’ would be a better term, given their cramped proportions. Surrounded by dozens of similarly forbidding, state-owned monstrosities housing some 10,000 Muslims, the vast majority of North African origin, this is the grim Parisian enclave where Cherif Kouachi was radicalised – and is believed to have plotted the horrific magazine massacre. Scroll down for video . A history of violence: Youths set cars ablaze and roam the streets as they battled police in Paris in 2005 . From the Marais, the chic quarter where Charlie Hebdo’s offices are situated, it took my taxi barely 20 minutes to reach his seventh-floor flat in the northern suburb of Gennevilliers yesterday. Though it is just seven miles from the scene of the carnage, once you pass beneath the thundering Peripherique ring-road and enter this soulless district, you have reached a parallel universe. Half a century ago, Gennevilliers was an archetypically French community, as illustrated by the charming sepia photographs hanging in the Brazza brasserie, opposite the town hall, showing people dining on shady terraces, and riding bicycles in their berets. Then, the faces were almost all Gallic. Today, you can walk the length of a crowded boulevard here without seeing a solitary white Frenchman, and the idyllic ambience lives only in the memory of the very few older residents who remain. It has been replaced by a menacing edginess, and – when approached by a British reporter seeking to understand why young French-Arabs are turning to Islamic extremism, apparently in ever increasing numbers – a deeply ingrained sense of mistrust. A decade ago, after the incendiary Parisian race riots of 2005, I ventured to another of these seething ‘banlieues’, to be greeted with extraordinary courtesy by youths who had, a few hours earlier, been hurling petrol bombs. Then, they were eager to air their deep sense of disaffection. Yesterday, in the Arab café and kebab shop Cherif frequented, I met with shrugs of indifference and hostile stares. It was left to Mohammed Benali, president of his local mosque where 3,000 people worship each Friday, to explain why, for ‘a tiny minority’ of young French Muslims, violence was their chosen path. A car burns during clashes almost a decade ago in the Parisian suburb of Aulnay sur Bois during riots . During the Sixties and Seventies, he said, when immigrant labourers from Morocco, Algeria and Senegal were shipped in to rebuild post-war France, suburbs such as Gennevilliers (where they worked mainly in car factories and heavy industrial plants) were utterly transformed. Yet for this first generation – well-paid and comparatively well accommodated in the vast new tower blocks built to house them – life was satisfactory enough. However, it was not the French policy even to attempt to integrate or educate them. On the contrary, they were pushed to the margins, to be tolerated rather than welcomed, and among the indigenous French population the level of discrimination was beyond anything we have witnessed in Britain. The problem manifested itself in the second generation – to which Cherif, an adopted, French-Algerian orphan born in the mid-Eighties, belonged. ‘They saw how their parents were treated and felt deeply resentful,’ M. Benali told me. ‘After the 2005 riots I was among a Muslim delegation who met Nicolas Sarkozy (then interior minister) and I’ll never forget his words. The seven-storey block is where suspect Cherif Kouachi (pictured) was radicalised - and is believed to have plotted the horrific magazine massacre . ‘He told me that “to humiliate is to radicalise” – and that is exactly what came to pass. This second generation felt excluded, discriminated against, and most of all, humiliated. Added to which, they were deeply mixed up – they spoke and felt French, but were regarded as Arabic; they were culturally confused.’ Among the elders at his mosque, he said there had been lengthy discussions about the offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoons, and whenever they were published feelings ran high. Yet, he maintained, worshippers – particularly the younger ones – were encouraged to accept the principle of free speech, and embrace French values along with their Islamic beliefs. But Cherif – an occasional worshipper at the mosque – was among a handful who refused to follow this instruction, he said. ‘When the imam told everyone to enrol on the register of electors so they could take part in elections, and play their part in society, he refused. He said he wasn’t a French citizen and wanted nothing to do with the democratic process. He then walked out of the mosque. But these beliefs didn’t come from the imams who teach here. He had been who knows where. He was using the internet. He was crazy; brainwashed. He was beyond our reach.’ Perhaps so, yet according to one friend, a surly young man who lived in his block who agreed to speak anonymously yesterday, Cherif was an unlikely killer. The sort who would walk up five flights of stairs rather than share the tiny, often uncomfortably crowded lift in his apartment block. However, to Eric Badday, a 60-year-old Tunisian-born writer who has lived next door to him for seven years – and saw Cherif’s young wife being led away in handcuffs on Wednesday afternoon – it came as no surprise that he is being hunted. ‘Cherif wore Western clothes, unlike his wife who dressed traditionally, but he was the type who believes Allah is the cure for all life’s ills, from social problems to depression,’ he told me. ‘You could just tell he was a fanatic.’ A . ccording to Professor Olivier Roy, a French expert on political Islam, this impression fits perfectly with the stereotype of a frightening new breed of alienated young French-Arabs living in the shadowy margins of Gallic society. Young men who have been ‘radicalised through de-culturisation’, as he puts it. A vast block in Gennevilliers, which is a seemingly impenetrable concrete warren divided into some 600 apartments . ‘These are second or third generation descendants of immigrants,’ he told the Daily Mail. ‘They don’t speak Arabic; they don’t wear traditional Arab clothes or eat traditional Arab food or listen to traditional Arab music. They do not speak the language of their parents and have not been educated in religion by them. ‘They have the sense that they are living in a disenfranchised ghetto and then there is a process of self-radicalisation... it is a form of Islam totally opposed to any culture, Eastern or Western, and has its own set of explicit order – do this, don’t do that. The partner of Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier wept last night as she paid tribute to her ‘hero’. Jeannette Bougrab, 41, said: ‘There will be a before and an after but I have lost Stephane.’ The lawyer and ex-government minister hailed the cartoonist, nicknamed Charb, and his colleagues, saying: ‘They were heroes. I was with a hero that I loved.’ She added: ‘He was executed because he was defending secularism ... they fought for principles and freedoms that we forgot to defend. ‘They died so that we can remain free in this country.’ ‘These young people are out of reach of the traditional Muslim authorities. They don’t care what the imams say or the leader of the Grand Mosque in Paris. They radicalise between themselves.’ For years, it seems, Cherif maintained a low profile, living on casual work and, like many young Muslims (who claim with some justification to be last in the queue for jobs), on welfare handouts. His disenchantment hardened into radicalism, and an 18-month spell in jail. Given that 80 per cent of French prisoners are Muslims, yet no attempt is made to de-radicalise the fundamentalists among them, he emerged festering with even more anger. Nothing can fully explain the depths of hatred and cold-blooded barbarism that motivated those three young Frenchmen on Wednesday morning, of course. But visiting Gennevilliers offers a chilling glimpse into the minds of the killers – and you leave with the sombre conviction that, fomenting in those dreadful tower blocks, there are plenty of others who will regard them not as evil monsters. But as heroes.","Seven-storey block is where suspect Cherif Kouachi was radicalised .

"Four years  after then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot, President Barack Obama says she still has 'the same energy and passion that she always had.' Obama met Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, today while in Phoenix to give a speech on housing. Obama called Giffords a hero, said he's proud of her and praised her gun control advocacy. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama pictured today visiting a woman and child after speaking outside a home in a housing development in Phoenix . He says even as she's waged her own fight to recover, she's been fighting to prevent the next tragedy. Six people were killed and 13 were wounded in the 2011 shooting at a Giffords political event at a Tucson shopping center. Obama traveled to Tucson four days later to speak at a memorial service at the University of Arizona. The city of Tuscson also honored the victims on the anniversary of the shooting today and rang 19 solemn bells as a tribute. Giffords did not attend the event because she was with President Barack Obama in Phoenix. Gabby Giffords and husband Mark Kelly pictured in East Hampton, New York, in August 2013 . In his speech today, Obama said: 'It was four years ago today that Gabby and some other wonderful Arizonans were gunned down outside a supermarket in Tucson. 'It's a tough day for a lot of folks down there, we keep them in (our) thoughts and prayers.' The ceremony in Tucson took place at 10:10 a.m. Thursday and included a bell-ringing for each of the 19 victims of the attack. Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild also hosted a bell-ringing ceremony at a fire station downtown. 'I think it's important that we never forget what happened because there are a lot of lessons that can be learned from what happened,' said former Arizona Rep. Ron Barber, who was wounded in the shooting and who attended the ceremony. Peter Rhee, chief of the trauma at University of Arizona Medical Center, is the doctor credited with saving the lives of Giffords and others. Flowers, teddy bears and inspirational posters line a room at the Arizona History Museum in Tucson in this Wednesday, Jan. 7, to honor the victims . Standing outside the hospital Thursday, Rhee said he was changed by that day and thinks about it often. But he said many positive things came of the tragedy. 'The discussion on gun control is much higher on a national level. We can't just keep going on like this,' Rhee said. The Jan. 8, 2011, shooting shook Tucson, a city that considers itself a tight-knit community despite its half-million residents. Among those killed was 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, whose face adorns many of the memorial messages left at the shooting site and the hospital. U.S. District Judge John Roll and Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman were also killed. Barber, who worked for Giffords at the time, was wounded but later took over her seat in Congress. Jared Loughner was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting. Giffords, who was shot in the head, still struggles to speak and walk. She has become the face of gun control, having founded Americans for Responsible Solutions with her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. The items were left at the scene of the Jan. 8, 2011 shooting in Tucson that left six dead and 13 wounded . The gun control group raised millions for congressional candidates in the 2014 election, including Barber, who lost his seat to Republican Martha McSally. The group has garnered attention nationwide but has been able to do little to change gun laws. Organizers with the January 8th Memorial, a nonprofit foundation, are in the final phase of selecting a designer for a permanent memorial that will be placed at a downtown Tucson park. The foundation hopes to finish the memorial this year, manager Michelle Crow said. It will be at El Presidio Park in downtown Tucson, but there are plans for other exhibits. Items from memorials left at the site of the shooting and the hospital are on display in two rooms at the Arizona History Museum in Tucson. The exhibit began in October and ends Friday.","Obama called Giffords a hero and said he's proud of her and her gun control advocacy .

"Hashim Hanif Ibn Abdul-Rasheed, 41, of Columbus, was shot dead at an Ohio airport after lunging at a cop with a knife . A bomb squad found containers of frozen urine in the vehicle of man who police said lunged at an airport officer with a knife and was fatally shot. The suspicious material was confirmed as urine after the confrontation on Wednesday at Port Columbus International Airport, said the local police union leader, Jason Pappas. It's not clear why the man had the containers. Investigators said he had tried unsuccessfully to buy an airline ticket using a woman's ID, then got into the fatal confrontation with airport police after returning to his illegally parked vehicle. Police identified the man as 41-year-old Hashim Hanif Ibn Abdul-Rasheed, of Columbus. No one answered the door on Thursday at a Hillard address listed for him. Police were investigating the man's background and why he was using a woman's ID. After the first shots were fired, he got up and headed back toward the terminal, and a second airport officer shot him, Columbus police Sgt. Rich Weiner said. He was shot multiple times. Pappas said three officers were involved in the confrontation. He said two uniformed airport officers approached the man, and one struggled with him and fired before retreating, at which point a detective came out of the airport and fired at the attacker. Abdul-Rasheed had multiple knives on him, police said. The first officer who fired suffered scrapes and bruises, but the police weren't seriously hurt, Pappas said. Scroll down for video . Members of the bomb squad check out a parked SUV at port Columbus Airport on Wednesday. A man who tried to buy an airline ticket using a fake ID was fatally shot after returning to his illegally parked car, where he lunged at an airport police officer with a knife . The officers will be on administrative leave for at least two days and will have counseling with a police psychologist, per standard procedure, he said. Columbus city police are handling the investigation. They have not released surveillance video that is expected to show what happened. Court records in Cuyahoga County show Abdul-Rasheed was indicted in Cleveland in 1999 on charges including attempted murder, aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery - all with firearms specifications. The court determined he was mentally ill subject to involuntary hospitalization and found him not guilty by reason of insanity in June 2000. He was committed to the maximum security unit of a psychiatric facility in Dayton. He remained under court supervision for more than a decade, transitioning to a different behavioral health care facility, then a group home with full-time supervision in 2002, semi-supervised housing and eventually independent living. His commitment ended in December 2012, and the case was closed. Emergency vehicles converge at Port Columbus International Airport after officials said an airport police officer shot and killed a man after a confrontation on Wednesday . County records indicate the same defendant had been convicted of attempted felonious assault in 1995 under a plea deal. His five-to-10 year prison sentence was suspended, and he was put on probation and sentenced to community service and counseling. Online court records don't indicate details of the crimes, and calls seeking more information from a division of the court clerk's office rang unanswered Thursday. Neighbors at Abdul-Rasheed's apartment complex in suburban Columbus said they saw a man outside his apartment two nights ago screaming and pounding on the door. The man fit Abdul-Rasheed's description, but they couldn't say if it was him. 'He was just screaming, ''Why? Why?''' Tim Butts, whose apartment is across the parking lot, said Thursday. Butts, a technology manager in the Columbus area, said at first he thought the man was joking around. 'It went on and on for about 10 minutes,' Butts said. 'He was just outside the apartment there, banging on the door a couple times, then starts screaming, looking everywhere with his hands in the air.'","The suspicious material was confirmed as urine by the bomb squad at Port Columbus International Airport .

"Throughout Barack Obama's presidency, Arizona has served as a symbol of the nation's real estate crisis and recovery. When Obama visited Arizona within weeks of taking office in 2009, the state was among the hardest hit by the housing collapse and the White House was pushing multibillion-dollar programs to save homeowners from foreclosure. Six years later, Arizona's foreclosure crisis has evaporated. Home prices have soared and are nearing pre-crisis levels. On Thursday, Obama returns to Arizona seeking to tackle lingering issues and unintended consequences of the recovery. He'll announce a cut in mortgage insurance premiums on Federal Housing Administration loans, a move aimed at attracting new home buyers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama greeted supporters after arriving at Sky Harbor International Airport on Wednesday in Phoenix; he will speak at Central High School on Thursday . 'We're taking this measure to make home ownership more affordable for responsible families,' Housing Secretary Julian Castro said ahead of the president's remarks at a Phoenix high school. The housing announcement is the first marker for Obama as he unveils new tenets of his economic agenda in the lead-up to the State of the Union address on Jan. 20. The economic recovery has been uneven through much of Obama's presidency, but officials say they feel more confident that recent signs of progress can be sustained given the stronger level of growth and increases in consumer confidence. Like other areas of the economy, the housing market has rebounded from the depths of the recession. Yet home sales nationwide slowed in 2014, as rising home values pushed many would-be buyers to the sidelines. Wage growth has failed to match the sharp increase in home prices since the market bottomed out in 2012, leaving many Americans without the income level or down payment to buy a home. In Arizona, home ownership rates have dropped by more than 6 per cent from their 2006 peak. New home construction in the state also remains well below what economists believe is a healthy level, with many buyers shut out of the market because of tougher loan standards, higher prices and the lingering fears from the foreclosure crisis. The rate cut Obama will announce Thursday drops the FHA mortgage insurance premium from 1.35 per cent to 0.85 per cent. Administration officials said the move would save the average home buyer $900 a year, help 800,000 who refinance their mortgages save money, and draw 250,000 new homeowners into the market over the next three years – a modest increase in sales. The rate cut will go into effect by the end of the month. Arizona-based economist Elliott Pollack said the move would 'help on the margins, but it really isn't a game-changer.' Obama spoke at a Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan on Wednesday on the first leg of a three-city tour to talk up his economic achievements . Still, the savings would be meaningful for individual homeowners. The National Association of Realtors estimates that a home buyer with 5 per cent down and a $175,000 mortgage would save $818 per year, or $14,079 over the life of a 30-year mortgage. Even with the reduction, the new 0.85 per cent premium is higher than historic norms. The rate was initially increased to raise FHA capital reserves, which took a hit during the housing crisis and are still not back to their required minimums. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker said the decision was 'bad news for taxpayers and is yet another irresponsible, head-scratching decision from the administration in regards to our nation's housing finance system.' Administration officials said that even with the rate cut, FHA will be able to replenish its reserves. Officials also said the rate cut would do nothing to change the eligibility requirements for FHA loans. 'Our action is not a return to the past,' Castro said. Obama is expected to tout Thursday's housing announcement in his State of the Union address. In a strategy shift for the White House, the president is unveiling some of the proposals from the address ahead of the Jan. 20 speech rather than follow the usual protocol of keeping policy announcements secret until Obama speaks to Congress. The president is making his pre-State of the Union pronouncements during a series of stops around the country. He visited Michigan on Wednesday and closes out the week in Tennessee, with additional travel expected next week.","Arizona's foreclosure crisis has evaporated since the president took office .

The former Microsoft CEO was spotted breaking it down with some impressive sideline dance moves as the Black Eyed Peas singer performed at the Staples Center Wednesday evening during his team's game against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Break it down: The former Microsoft CEO was filmed screaming and flailing his arms (above) on the sideline during the singer's performance . 'He danced exactly how I expected him to, but the enthusiasm is amazing' said Clippers player Blake Griffin. Head coach Doc Rivers said he had 'no comment' on Ballmer's dance moves, joking; 'Our relationship is too new.' He then added; 'It probably distracted the whole team, that's for sure.' Forward Matt Barnes may have had the best response however, saying; 'You can't have everything. You can't have money and moves.' This is not the first time Ballmer has commanded a room with his high energy behavior either, showing off some near identical moves during a 2006 presentation while still with Microsoft. Ballmer made headlines when he purchased the Clippers last August for $2billion in the wake of the Donald Sterling scandal. And while the sale was one of the most expensive in NBA history, it has so far paid off for Ballmer, with the Clippers currently in second place in their division. The team also improved their record last night, as after Ballmer's energetic dance performance they went on to defeat the Lakers.","Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer was spotted dancing to Fergie during the singer's halftime performance Wednesday night .

"For years it’s been thought that snakes lost regions in their bodies such as their neck, as they evolved from four-legged lizard ancestors into their sinuous shape. But by looking at subtle differences in the shapes of snakes’ vertebrae bones, palaeontologists believe they have shed new light on how the creatures evolved their legless bodies. Researchers claim that snakes didn’t lose distinct regions, but that instead mammals and birds independently gained them, turning snake evolution on its head. Scientists have dispelled the theory that hox genes, which establish the boundaries of the neck and trunk, lin birds, lizards, crocodiles and mammals, were disrupted in snakes, resulting in a loss of regions in their seemingly simplified body form as they evolved from four-legged lizard ancestors (illustrated) Hox genes, which establish the boundaries of the neck, trunk (body), lumbar and tail regions in birds, lizards, crocodiles and mammals, were previously thought to have been disrupted in snakes, resulting in a loss of defined regions, forming their elongated, legless shape. To investigate whether the theory was right, P. David Polly of Indiana University, Bloomington and Jason Head of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln examined regional differences in the shapes of individual vertebral bones in snakes, lizards, alligators and mice. Snakes are different from other amniote groups – those that descended from four-limbed animals with backbones that lay eggs on land – because they lack forelimbs, shoulder girdles and sternal skeletons. Until now, it had been assumed that snake vertebrae became less regionalised, or defined, when the limbs were lost. By studying the vertebrae of snakes, (a skeleton is pictured,) researchers have concluded that the reptiles didn’t lose distinct regions, but that instead mammals and birds independently gained them . A snake's backbone is made up of between 200 and 400 vertebrae attached to ribs, which helps them be so flexible. By comparison, humans have 33 vertebrae and 24 ribs. The bones and muscle protect the reptile's internal organs. The throat of the snake takes up the front third of the animal's body, while its stomach can stretch to the size of the animal it is eating. The skulls of snakes vary in composition but have numerous joints to allow them to swallow prey far larger than their heads. Their jaws are not fused together, so when they have a mouthful of food, they can still breathe using a tube at the bottom of their mouth, which can protrude. ‘If the evolution of the snake body was driven by simplification or loss of Hox genes, we would expect to see fewer regional differences in the shapes of vertebrae,’ Dr Head explained. ‘Instead, what we found was the exact opposite. Snakes have the same number of regions and in the same places in the vertebral column as limbed lizards.’ The duo discovered that the snakes they studied were as varied as lizards. When they compared regions in snakes with Hox gene expression - the process by which information from a gene is used to make a protein - they found that the two matched, according to the study in Nature. ‘This suggests that Hox genes are functioning in the evolution and development of the vertebral column in snakes - but instead of patterning distinct, rib-less regions like the neck and lumbar spine of mice, they control more subtle, graded changes in shape,’ the said. When the findings were combined with information from fossils, the researchers concluded that the direction of snake evolution is the opposite of what was previously thought based on genetics alone. ‘Our findings turn the sequence of evolutionary events on its head, Dr Polly said. Dr Polly said that the study's findings 'turn the sequence of evolutionary events [in snakes]  on its head'. She observed that snakes have lost the shoulder girdle but as just as regionalised as lizards . ‘It isn’t that snakes have lost regions and Hox expression, it is that mammals and birds have independently gained distinct regions by augmenting the ordinary Hox expression shared by early amniotes. ‘Snakes have a lot more vertebrae compared to lizards and they have lost the shoulder girdle, but they are just as regionalised,’ Polly said. To come to their conclusion, the researchers used a method called geometric morphometrics, which marks individual points on a plane using a pair of numerical coordinates to analyse the shape and size of vertebral structures. They also used a statistical method called 'maximum likelihood estimation' to work out where one segment ends and the next begins. Dr Head said: ‘Analysis of gene functions are necessary, but not sufficient in studying evolutionary transitions. ‘In order to fully understand the mechanisms by which new body forms evolve, it is crucial to study the anatomy of modern and fossil organisms.’","Palaeontologists at Indiana University and University of Nebraska-Lincoln examined differences in  vertebrae in snakes, lizards, alligators and mice .

"A Perth man has been left baffled after being handed a contract detailing extensive rules for living in the share house he rents with two other people, leaving friends comparing the strict agreement to the Big Bang Theory's Sheldon Cooper. The 28-year-old was searching for a new home in Perth when he stumbled across an ad for a share house on a Gumtree, and agreed to move into the residence without meeting the people he would be sharing with. After living in the house for four months, he was presented with a two-page contract to sign by his female housemate, full of rules and regulations which included using headphones 'when watching tv for a long period of time', and no noise after 10pm. 'While I was aware that she had been planning to draft a house agreement, I had no idea that it would be this full on. When I got it I was so taken a back at how intense it was,' he said. Scroll down for video . A Perth man has been left baffled after being handed a contract detailing strict and extensive rules for living in the share house he rents with two other people . The contract states that the extensive list has been constructed in order that 'housemates can get on with enjoying peaceful lives', and that rules allows 'clear expectations' so that 'misunderstandings are minimised'. 'I've been living there for four months, and knew that she was very clean. I could tell from her emails even before I moved in, so I guess I knew what I was getting myself into, but at the same time I couldn't believe that she felt she needed to do this,' he said. 'It's not even her house, it's a share property. She's on the lease, which is why she probably feels like she can say 'this is how it's going to be if you want to live here,' he said. Doors are always to be 'closed gently', especially before 6am after 10pm, as 'the living area is a large open space where all sound is transmitted easily'. After living in the house for four months, the 28-year-old was presented with a two-page contract to sign by his female housemate . One Facebook user asked 'Are you living with Sheldon Cooper?', in reference to the Big Bang Theory's 'roommate agreement' One Facebook user asked 'Are you living with Sheldon Cooper? Did he sign the roommate agreement? 'Obviously over time little things can annoy people, but I thought we had a pretty good working relationship. The other girl we live with moved in about two months ago, and for some reason she decided to let us both know how it was going to be,' he said. 'It wasn't even just being given the contract, but she felt she had to explain it to me. We must have spent 45 minutes going through it line by line, she elaborated on everything in detail,' he said. After receiving the contract, he showed the the document to his brother, who took to social media to poke fun at the extensively detailed list. Photos of the contract to Facebook with the caption 'You think your housemates are bad?', sparking outrage and satirical comments from his friends. One Facebook user asked 'Are you living with Sheldon Cooper? Did he sign the roommate agreement?', in reference to the Big Bang Theory episode where two of the sitcoms flatmates sign a document when they first move in together. The Roommate Agreement has multiple sections with bizarre clauses that uptight character Sheldon Cooper uses to his advantage throughout the series. The rules include wiping the bench after every use, emptying the sink strainer every time food is collected, and the use of headphones for watching television for extended stretches of time, unless 'negotiated' otherwise. 'I knew she was clean, so I really did my best to mirror that. Obviously things will build up over time but this has been taken to the next level,' he said. Several commentators labelled the rules 'outrageous', 'intense', 'extreme', and 'hilarious'.

Several commentators labelled the rules 'outrageous', 'intense', 'extreme', and 'hilarious . According the house rules, no friends were allowed to sleep on the property's couches, and parties must end at midnight. If parties did take place, all the cleaning up must be completed by the next day, and dishes were to be put in the dishwasher 'immediately' after being used. There are no drugs allowed ever, 'anyone, anytime', the list states. The rules also stated that while recycling would not be 'enforced', if potential housemates were confused as to what items were recyclable, there was a list on the bin to aid them in their pursuit. One social media user poked fun at the vacuum having a name, with the rules stating 'run Thomas' when the floor needs to be cleaned. 'I thought Thomas must have been their slave', joked one Facebook user. The Perth man said that Thomas was quite a presence in the house, and had even been mentioned in the Gumtree ad for the property. One social media user poked fun at the vacuum having a name, with the rules stating 'run Thomas' when the floor needs to be cleaned . The rules also go beyond housekeeping, and include a section of 'mechanism for keeping peace'. One of the rules state, 'before bringing something up, consider whether it was an isolated incident or an ongoing issue; and consider the level of impact of the situation on all housemates/neighbours'. Notes alerting other housemates to an issue are strictly banned, with all communication to be done face to face, or during a house meeting. A 'proactive, problem-solving approach' with 'mutually agreeable outcomes' are desired. At the end of the rules the writer states that if differences of opinion can't be settled, it may 'signal that people might be better off and happier living with like-minded others'. The 28-year-old said that this might end up being the case, and that he now feels like he's 'done his run'. 'Now that she's given us the rules, things have definitely changed. I got a text last night from her because I was watching TV past 10pm, which said 'it's bedtime',' he said. 'It's just such a strange situation, really crazy.

"A man who tried to buy an airline ticket using a fake ID was fatally shot Wednesday after returning to his illegally parked car, where he lunged at an airport police officer with a knife during a confrontation, police said. The man had multiple knives on him and suspicious items in his car that led to a bomb squad investigation, Columbus police Sgt. Rich Weiner said. The man was identified only as a Columbus-area resident in his early 40s pending notification of his relatives. Scroll down for video . Emergency response: A man who tried to buy an airline ticket at the Columbus airport using a fake ID was fatally shot Wednesday after returning to his illegally parked car, police said . Incident: Police say the man lunged at an officer with a knife during a confrontation, police said.  After the first shots, the man got up and headed back toward the terminal, then a second airport officer shot him. It was unclear whether he was shot by both officers . After the first shots were fired, the man got up and headed back toward the terminal, at which point a second airport officer shot him, Weiner said. It was unclear whether he was shot by both officers. He was shot multiple times, Weiner said. Police are investigating the man's background and why he was using a fake ID to buy a ticket. He tried at one point to use a woman's ID, Weiner said. 'At this point this is just a violent encounter between an armed man and the officers here,' the sergeant said. Surveillance video, which was not released, will show what happened, he said. An SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad as a precaution, Whitaker had said. The incident caused delays of just over an hour during the search of the man's vehicle, when portions of the ticket lobby were cordoned off and a checkpoint to a Delta concourse was closed, said Elaine Roberts, president and chief executive officer of Columbus Regional Airport Authority. Departing passengers who normally would be dropped off on the level where the shooting happened were redirected to a lower level. The confrontation occurred after the officer called a tow truck for the man's vehicle, which he left illegally parked in the departures area. The airport and the Transportation Security Administration prohibit unauthorized vehicles in the departures area, Roberts said, adding the shooting was the first such incident in the airport's history. 'We are very pleased that we are back to a normal state for passengers,' she said. Stuck: The main concourse of the Port Columbus Airport was filled with stranded travelers after a shooting in front of the north entrance caused a partial shutdown . Departing passengers were directed to enter through the arrivals area as the departures area was blocked off . WBNS reported that the suspect was in the ticketing lobby outside security checkpoints. Police said there was also a call for an officer in trouble just before shots were fired. Speaking to the Columbus Dispatch Wednesday evening, eyewitness Jim Shriner said he saw the suspect advance on two uniformed police officers and reach for his waistband before a third plainclothes cop shot and killed him. Shriner, the owner of a towing business, said he was called to the airport to haul away an illegally parked car. When he pulled up outside the departures area, Shriner said he saw a man fighting with two officers and heard two shots fired. The suspect went down, but then got back up and proceeded to advance on the two officers who had their guns drawn but were retreating. Precaution: An SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad . The man pointed at his waistband, but Shriner said he did not see a gun there. One of the uniformed cops struck the suspect with a baton on his legs before the third officer arrived and shot him dead. Shriner speculated that he may have been called to the airport to tow the slain suspect's SUV from the terminal. Matt Diehl of Columbus was waiting to board a flight in a growing crowd. He had two hours before it took off for Philadelphia for business, but he wasn't sure if it wouldn't be delayed.

"Fans of the West Coast fast food chain In-N-Out Burger who turned out for the grand opening of the 300th franchise this week got a rare chance to meet the company's reclusive billionaire owner. Lynsi Snyder, 32, the thrice-divorced granddaughter of In-N-Out's founders, has largely kept out of the public eye since assuming control of the $1.1billion burger empire in 2010. But Snyder made an exception Wednesday, on what would have been her grandma Esther's 95th birthday, arriving at In-N-Out's newest location on State College Boulevard to personally cut the big red ribbon. Scroll down for video . Grand opening: Lynsi Snyder, 32, personally cut the big red ribbon marking the opening of In-N-Out's 300th location in Anaheim, California . Milestone: The newest location of the West Coast burger empire is on State College Boulevard . Dynasty: Lynsi is the only biological heir to the In-N-Out fortune, but she grew up with two half-sisters (pictured) from her mother Lynda's (bottom left) previous marriage . When asked by a KTLA reporter about her notorious penchant for privacy, Snyder - America's youngest female billionaire - replied that being a mother and businesswoman, she is trying to keep her priorities straight. Dressed in a casual yet chic ensemble consisting of a black skirt, tan sweater and knee-high boots, Snyder was all smiles as she exchanged hugs with her employees and greeted a crowd of eager patrons. Some die-hard fans of the iconic burger chain camped out overnight to be among the first people to dine at In-N-Out's latest location. The very first burger to come out of the kitchen at the Anaheim location went to long-time In-N-Out patron Kurt Zimmerman, who had been waiting to put in his order since 2am. 'The first burger at a new place...it's got to be the best,' the diner gushed to KCAL. In-N-Out was started in 1948 by Lynsi Snyder's grandparents, Esther and Harry Snyder. The chain currently has locations in 13 cities in California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Momentous occasion: The grand opening fell on  what would have been In-N-Out co-founder Esther Snyder's 95th birthday . Enigmatic: Snyder rarely appears in public and keeps her private life under wraps . Miss Snyder inherited the billion-dollar business in 2006 after the passing of her grandmother and became the president of the company four years later. Snyder, a deeply devout Christian, has always cut an enigmatic figure, rarely appearing in public and keeping mum about her family life. A rare exception was her unusually candid interview with Orange Coast magazine published a year ago, in which the burger heiress opened up about being the target of two kidnapping attempts, her turbulent family history and her three failed marriages. Snyder grew up in Northern California where her father, Guy, had a ranch. The Snyder family is extremely devout, so much so that Guy Snyder founded a private Christian school with the sole purpose of providing his daughter with a religious education while protecting her privacy. In her adult life, Snyder became involved in the Christian ministry Healing Hearts and Nations along with her second husband. As a teenager, she worked behind the counter at one of her family's In-N-Out locations, performing menial tasks like peeling potatoes and chopping onions. After the passing of her grandfather in 1976, the chain was handed down to her uncle, Rich, who was considered to be more responsible than his older brother, a drug addict. Tragedy struck in 1993 when Rich Snyder died in a small plane crash in Los Angeles. Lynsi was 11 years old at the time. Business woman: Snyder is rarely seen unless it is to do with drag racing (left) but she gave an interview to Orange Coast last January (right) Clan: Lynsi's mother Lynda (third from left) posted this family photo from a trip to Bora Bora in 2012. Lynsi  is pictured second from right with her then-husband Val Torres . Her father then inherited the company, but he passed away only six years later from an accidental drug overdose. She was only 17 when that occurred in the winter of 1999 but had expressed an interest in the family business and had spent the summer working at the Redding location. Earlier that year, just months before her father's passing, Lynsi narrowly escaped the first of two abduction attempts. The second failed kidnapping plot targeting the wealthy heiress came when she was 24 years old and already divorced. Snyder's first husband was Jeremiah Seawell, her high school sweetheart, and they married when she was only 18. The union only lasted two years, but by the time she was 25 she remarried Richard Martinez, a man who was working at In-N-Out at the time. Matters of the heart: Lynsi met her second husband, Richard Martinez (pictured left) when they were both working at In-N-Out and they got married in 2005 . They had twins before their marriage ended in 2011.Though she had the foresight to demand a prenup before marrying her second husband, she still pays him $18,000 a month in child support. Multiple reports state that Lynsi and Richard split in 2011 and she then went on to marry drag racer Val Torres Jr later that same year. Snyder had inherited her love of the dangerous street-racing sport from her father, along with his massive car collection. In July 2011, Snyder gave birth to a baby boy named Valentino Guy, but she has never mentioned this son in interviews. In early 2014, reports emerged that the couple were in the process of getting a divorce. Snyder currently resides with her family in a sprawling $17.4million mansion in Bradbury, California, which she bought in 2013 from former L.A. Dodgers player Adrian Beltre.","Billionaire Lynsi Snyder took part in ribbon-cutting ceremony at In-N-Out's newest location in Anaheim, California .

"A mother-of-two learnt that her husband of six-years had collapsed and died after a police officer called her mobile while she was at work. David Williams, 35, passed away after suffering a massive asthma attack at a neighbour's house. His wife, Ruth, was unaware of his death until she received the call from the North Wales Police officer and initially dismissed it as a 'sick joke.' The 32-year-old later complained to the force and the unnamed police constable has received a final written warning for his behaviour, that was branded 'wholly inappropriate' and 'unacceptable.' Ruth Williams learnt that her husband, David, had collapsed and died in a telephone call from a North Wales police constable. The couple pictured on their wedding day . North Wales Police defended the actions of the officer at the time saying that he had been 'forced reluctantly' to break the news when he answered a call on Mr Williams' mobile phone. But after an investigation police chiefs admitted that the officer had in fact phoned Mrs Williams on her mobile. Superintendent Peter Newton said: 'It is not the usual practice of North Wales Police to inform a next of kin of death by telephone. 'In the circumstances this was a wholly inappropriate and unacceptable way to inform Mrs Williams of her husband's death and both the Force and the officer concerned have apologised to her.' The officer involved has received a final written warning. Mr Williams, 35, who has young daughters with his wife, died from a severe asthma attack. Mrs Williams, pictured above on her wedding day, said: 'I just wish they had come to tell me in person, it would have made it easier' Mrs Williams had been working at The Golden Fleece pub near her home in Tremadog, North Wales, when her husband collapsed at a neighbour's house. She said: 'I was doing a shift at the Fleece and my mobile rang, which I'd left behind the bar. 'It was a number I didn't recognise and I'd missed the call as I was serving a customer. 'I rang the number back off the work phone and the man introduced himself as a police officer. 'He asked me if I was with Dave, and I said to him, 'no, I'm at work and he's at home'.

"A wealthy French baron has bought a rundown English stately home which was once a favourite of King James 1 to reclaim its 'deserved place in British history'. Jean Christophe Iseux, Baron von Pfetten - a French professor and diplomat dubbed the 'Red Baron' for his links to the Chinese Communist government - has splashed out £2.5million for Apethorpe Hall near Oundle, Northamptonshire. The grade I listed Jacobean manor, which was originally built in 1470-80, has recently been restored by English Heritage at a cost of £8million after being bought by the government in 2004 for £3.5million. Scroll down for video . Jean Christophe Iseux, Baron von Pfetten - a French professor, diplomat and former senior Chinese government adviser - has splashed out £2.5million for Apethorpe Hall near Oundle, Northamptonshire (pictured). The manor was once a haunt of James I, Elizabeth I and Charles I . The grade I listed Jacobean manor, which was originally built in 1470-80, has recently been restored by English Heritage at a cost of £8million after being bought by the government in 2004 for £3.5million. It currently has no electricity or running water but is set to be turned into a home . Originally built in 1470-80 by Sir Guy Wolston, who served as constable of the nearby royal castle at Fotheringhay, the 48-bedroom house was developed as the focal point and power base of leading Tudor and Jacobean families, closely involved with the Court of England's ruling monarchs for more than 150 years from Edward IV to Charles I. Despite its recent repair works, the grand property currently has no electricity or running water and is said to be in need of extensive further works to turn it into the family home which Baron von Pfetten desires. The baron, 47, who was a member of the Chinese parliament from 2001 until 2005, has just finished restoring a 17th century chateau in his native France and said he wanted Apethorpe Hall to 'regain the place in British history it deserves'. The hall was a favourite of King James I and its stately apartments were where he indulged in 'more commodious entertainment...and princely recreation' with his favourite, George Villiers, later to become the Duke of Buckingham. Baron von Pfetten, who was a member of the Chinese parliament from 2001 until 2005 where he got the nickname 'Red Baron', has just finished restoring a 17th century chateau in his native France and said he wanted Apethorpe Hall (above) to 'regain its deserved place in British history' Apethorpe Hall was left to ruin before English Heritage pumped £8million into its restoration to save 'one of England's finest country houses' Despite the extensive works (left) which have allowed the hall to keep some of its original features (right), there is still an extensive amount of work to do before it is a fully-operating family home. It is thought Baron von Pfetten will need to spend millions to restore it to a high standard . After a succession of owners, the hall – which also played host to Queen Elizabeth I and King Charles I - became the property of Libyan Wanis Mohammed Burweila. He left the country after the Libyan Embassy siege in 1984 and the hall was left to decay. It fell into ruin, was riven with dry rot, and its Jacobean plasterwork ceilings starting to collapse. Baron von Pfetten . Jean Christophe Iseux, Baron von Pfetten, 42, is a French professor, diplomat and former senior adviser to the Chinese government. He served in the Chinese parliament from 2001 to 2005 and was referred to by the Chinese press as the ‘Red Baron’. He was the first European ever to hold senior public office in the People's Republic of China. In 2013, he held a series of meetings on Iran's nuclear program at his home in Burgundy, France, which were attended by senior officials from Iran, Israel, China, the U.S., France and the UK. Baron von Pfetten, who is married, is a keen hunter and was elected President of the International Foxhound Association in 2012. He is a joint master of the New Forest Foxhounds in Hampshire, UK, and the Equipage de Vens et Venaille in Burgundy, France. He is currently master of his own hunt - Equipage de Selore - a private family pack of foxhounds and buckhounds based in the Chateau de Selore in St. Yan, Saône-et-Loire, France. However, it was eventually bought by developers in 2002 - a consortium led by former QPR president Harold Winton. But the group's plans for Apethorpe were not approved by the government, which issued a compulsory purchase order for the hall in 2004 for £3.5million. In 2008, the 51,000 sq. ft. building, complete with stable block, gardener's cottage and 45 acres of land, was put on the market for £4.5million. But the estate failed to attract a sale. English Heritage then spent £8million repairing the hall before putting it back on the market recently. As part of the deal with Baron von Pfetten, the hall will be open to the public for 50 days a year for the next 80 years. English Heritage will organise the public openings. Simon Thurley, English Heritage's chief executive, said Apethorpe was 'by far the most important country house to have been threatened with major loss through decay since the 1950s'. He added: 'Since 2000 English Heritage has consistently said that the best solution for Apethorpe is for it to be taken on by a single owner, who wants to continue to restore the house and to live in it; especially one who has experience of restoring historic buildings and is prepared to share its joys with a wide public, as Baron Pfetten will do. 'The purchase price is £2.5m, meaning that English Heritage will have spent a total of £10m saving this architectural masterpiece. 'Baron Pfetten has agreed to an 80-year commitment of 50 days public opening a year, a far more extensive undertaking than the normal period of 10 years in the case of English Heritage grant-aided properties. 'He will also need to fund the comprehensive refurbishment and fitting-out works himself.' Baron von Pfetten said he was delighted with the purchase and added: 'My wife and I learnt a lot from the ten years we have spent renovating our 17th century chateau in France. 'Probably the most important lesson we learnt was to give it all time. 'Luckily we are young and we have many friends with similar interests keen to support us. 'My wife and her family are also professional architects who specialise in work to historic buildings. 'Our vision for Apethorpe is to help this house regain the place in British history that it deserves.' Nick Hill, English Heritage's project manager for Apethorpe, said the property has been carefully restored to include its original furnishings. He said: 'Some of the roofs here were on the point of collapse when English Heritage intervened, which would have led to the loss of some of the finest Jacobean plasterwork in the country. 'We have made the roofs and structure safe and secure and repaired the plasterwork. 'We have also cleared away many of the disfiguring modern structures erected in the 1960s when it was a school. 'But it is right that we left decisions about internal refurbishment and decoration to the future occupier.' As part of English Heritage's deal with Baron von Pfetten, the grade I listed hall will  open to the public for 50 days a year for the next 80 years . In 2008, the 51,000 sq. ft. hall, complete with stable block, gardener's cottage and 45 acres of land, was put on the market for £4.5m. However, it failed to attract a sale and has now been sold to French professor Baron von Pfetten, who will use it as his main family home, for £2.5million . Apethorpe Hall was built in the late 15th century by Sir Guy Wolston and is a grade I listed building situated on the outskirts of Oundle in Northamptonshire . Apethorpe Hall was built in the late 15th century and is a grade I listed building situated near Oundle in Northamptonshire. It was built by Sir Guy Wolston, who then sold it to Sir Walter Mildmay and it stayed in his family for 350 years. It contains one of the country's most complete Jacobean interiors and hosted 13 royal visits between 1565 and 1636. It has a particularly important place in England's history because of the role it played in entertaining Tudor and Stuart royalty at the pinnacle of its influence around the turn of the 17th century. It also once played host to Queen Elizabeth I, King James I and King Charles I. The country house's state rooms are arguably the most complete in the country and provide a fascinating window on a rich period of English history. From the windows on the east side of the hall, it is said that Mildmay watched the arrival of Elizabeth I. Apethorpe was one of the Queen's favourite overnight stops on the Great North Road. It was also a favourite haunt of monarchs James and Charles I who enjoyed magnificent feasts of venison and wine. James I himself is believed to have enjoyed homosexual trysts when he visited the home 10 times between 1614 and 1624. The architectural importance of Apethorpe lies in the breadth of architectural elements which survive today from almost every period of English architecture since the late 15th century. Once described as Britain's most neglected grade I country house, the hall's more recent owners include the Catholic Church - which used it as a school - and millionaire Libyan Wanis Mohammed Burweila. After the shooting of WPc Yvonne Fletcher during the Libyan Embassy siege in 1984, Mr Burweila was among the many Libyans who fled the UK. He had been negotiating to sell the property to a consortium led by Harold Winton, the honorary life president of Queen's Park Rangers football club, which reportedly bought the property for £1.35million. But two days later, on account of its dilapidation, the Department of Culture Media and Sport served the compulsory purchase order and took it off their hands. After years of wrangling and a lands tribunal, the Government was eventually forced to pay £3.5 million for the house. It was handed over to English Heritage, with additional grant-in-aid to carry out a major programme of repairs with the utmost care and expertise. Since English Heritage took over, repairs costing £8million have been carried out and the building now stands in a secure state for the new owner to carry on the restoration work. The house has been used for filming scenes of various television historical dramas as well as the 1984 film Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth. Restoration and attempts to sell the property were also the subject of a fly-on-the-wall documentary first shown on BBC Two in April 2009.

"Pilot Ian Jennings (pictured arriving at Norwich Crown Court) was sentenced to nine months prison for flying a passenger jet while three and a half times over the alcohol limit . A pilot who flew an executive jet from Spain while hungover after a three-day drinking binge has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, from Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire scrap metal mogul Andre Serruys along with a woman and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight had become suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court heard. When officers breath-tested Jennings on October 30, he 'smelt strongly of alcohol and seemed nervous'. He was found to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted flying while the alcohol in his breath was over the prescribed limit at an earlier hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before but was told by Judge Stephen Holt that this claim 'did not add up'. His barrister accepted Jennings may have fallen foul of 'topping up' after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate his engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings had reported for work at 8am that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not breathalysed until after 2pm. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: 'Some eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. 'You must have been drinking considerably the night before you went to the airport. 'The public must have 100 per cent confidence that pilots in this country are 100 per cent sober. 'The devastation you could have wreaked, not only to passengers but also on the ground, goes without saying. 'It is my duty to send the clear message that any pilot who commits this kind of offence must expect an immediate custodial sentence.' On the morning of the incident, Jennings had acted as captain while a co-pilot flew the Canadair CL601-3A Challenger from Oxford to Palma in Majorca. Once there, Jennings took the controls and flew to Norwich. Somebody on board the flight became suspicious that he had been drinking and contacted the police. Officers detected 31 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 militres of breath - the limit for pilots is nine microgrammes while the limit for drivers is 35. Marcus Crosskell, mitigating, said Jennings had recently ended a period of flying out of Africa where he had been under pressure because of the Ebola epidemic. Mr Crosskell added: 'He is not a gentleman who habitually drinks or has a drink problem.

He was arrested at Norwich Airport (pictured) after landing the commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire scrap metal mogul Andre Serruys along with a woman and three teenage girls . 'But having ended a stint in Africa there was a period of celebration. 'He had got engaged that week and been out for various dinners and events and had been drinking alcohol in the three days leading up to the offence. 'The night before he had not drank excessive amounts of alcohol but he had been drinking heavily that week and may have been at the point where he was simply topping it up.' The court heard Jennings, who has 20 years experience as a pilot, began his career on an RAF scholarship after developing a love for aerobatic flying. He was described as having an exemplary record. Mr Crosskell added: 'He is a gentleman who has lost his distinguished career and his reputation.' His licence has been suspended by the Civil Aviation Authority.","Ian Jennings had flown back from Spain carrying millionaire Andre Serruys .

His 27-year-old girlfriend Maisie Dubosarsky was in Sydney visiting family and friends when the attack on the satirical newspaper took place.

She was left fearing for the worst until hearing news on Thursday morning he was alive but seriously injured. The bullet ricocheted off his spinal vertebra and perforated his lung. 'When they wake him up, we'll start to know,' she told Fairfax Media. 'Last night I was so happy because he wasn't dead. Now, realising that he might not walk again... it's kind of terrible. I just wish it wasn't real.' Ms Dubosarsky met her French boyfriend while on a working holiday in France 18 months ago. She flew back to Paris on Thursday afternoon to be by his side.

'They got threats all the time but … none of them thought that their lives were under threat. They were out in public all the time,' Ms Dubosarsky said. She said she had met several of the people who worked at Charlie Hebdo and described them as passionate about free speech. 'They knew they were at the forefront of that. They were attacking everyone – in a sense they were so libertarian they almost had no politics. They went for everybody,' she said.

"The father of a five-year-old girl who was thrown to her death off a 60-foot bridge in Tampa Bay has been charged with murder. John Jonchuck Jr, 25, was arrested half an hour after a man was seen speeding towards a bridge and throwing a child 60ft into the water on Wednesday night. Rescuers found Phoebe Jonchuk 40 minutes later but she could not be resuscitated. It has since emerged Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. Scroll down for video . Charged: John Jonchuk Jr, 25, (left) has been charged with murder after his five-year-old daughter Phoebe (right) was thrown to her death off a 60ft bridge in Tampa Bay . Mr Jonchuk separated from Phoebe's mother Michelle Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records. Jonchuk has had full custody of Phoebe since. Last month he filed a restraining order against Kerr last month, which was denied. With no fixed abode, the father and daughter have been living with John Jonchuk Sr for two months. But at midnight last night Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report. The officer who spotted the Cruiser gave chase and saw the driver reach the top of Dick Misener Bridge then enter the approach to the Skyway. The car was then seen to stop and a figure emerged, throwing a child over the side of the rail into the water off Boca Ciega Bay. The officer said he heard the girl scream as she fell. Jonchuk returned to the car and drove south but was stopped by Manatee County authorities about 30 minutes later. He was arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder. Jonchuk also faces charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding police. Tragic: This is the car seat, recovered from Boca Ciega Bay, in which investigators found the dead child . Arrested: An officer who claims to have witnessed the incident chased Jonchuk and detained him . Divers sent to Sunshine Skyway bridge (pictured) found Phoebe's lifeless body in the water after 40 minutes . The girl was found 40 minutes later by divers from Eckerd College and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and her mother was informed. At Jonchuk's first hearing on Thursday, Pinellas County Judge Michael Andrews asked him if he wanted an attorney. 'I want to leave it in the hands of God,' Jonchuck said. The judge responded: 'I'm pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial.' Details have since emerged of Jonchuk's 'strange' behavior on Wednesday that prompted his attorney Genevieve Torres to contact police. Torres said she met with John Jonchuck on Wednesday to discuss the custody case for his five-year-old daughter, Phoebe. After their meeting, she was so worried about the father and daughter that she reported the odd statements to police. Officers interviewed Jonchuck and his daughter as he was picking her up from a church day care and both appeared to be in good health. Jonchuck said he didn't want to harm himself or anyone else, the documents said. 'She was smiling and appeared healthy, properly clothed and happy,' according to the documents. A little more than twelve hours later, police said Jonchuck threw his daughter over a bridge. Jonchuk had legal custody of his daughter and they were looking for a permanent residence, reports claim . An officer saw a Chrysler PT Cruiser driving at 100mph towards the bridge before the girl was thrown . St Petersburg Police confirmed that the girl had died in hospital after she was pulled from the river . Kerr said she last saw her daughter and Jonchuck on Christmas Eve. They had a nice evening together and then he called child protective services on her and made false abuse allegations, she said. 'He does the Jekyll and Hyde. It's just something that goes on in his head, he just wasn't wired right,' she said. And yet, Kerr said that she never imagined Jonchuck would hurt Phoebe. Jonchuk's friend and former landlord Melody Dishman told Tampa Bay News she contacted police on Tuesday after receiving 'scary texts' from the 25-year-old calling her names he had 'found Jesus'. Officers told her to file for a restraining order. Dishman said the father and daughter moved out three months ago to stay with Jonchuk's 57-year-old father, John Jonchuk Sr. During their two-month stay, she claimed, Jonchuk shouted at Phoebe and locked her in her room. 'She didn't want to be around John. I could see it in her eyes,' Dishman said, but added: 'I would never think that he would have hurt her.' Police spokesman Yolanda Fernandez said: 'It's unfathomable I mean and officers see all kinds of things but it's still very difficult to see something like this unfold before your eyes. 'What could make someone throw someone over a railing, let alone your own child? How could you possibly understand that?'

"Hapless robber Paul Easby who failed to hold up a bank then arrived to rob a shop in a taxi, left his fingerprints on the door and forgot to put his balaclava on . A forgetful armed raider ordered a taxi to take him between robberies - only to then take off his balaclava as he walked past CCTV. Paul Easby had tried to hold up a bank minutes before he went into a corner shop to rob the staff at knifepoint in Plymouth, Devon. But while Easby, 37, managed to put on a balaclava  in the shop – just seconds earlier he had walked up and down the shop's aisles unmasked past several CCTV cameras. He then removed the mask as he left the shop - again in full view of cameras. The hapless raider even requested that the black cab waited outside the Londis shop in Plymouth, Devon, as he went inside armed with a knife. Easby brandished a knife and grabbed cash but fled when the store worker pushed the panic button. He jumped in the taxi , while the unsuspecting driver drove off - only for police to stop and arrest Easby, of Plymouth, Devon, minutes later. Easby pleaded guilty to attempting to rob a bank cashier and attempting to rob the Londis shop 1.3 miles away minutes later. He was jailed for ten years at Plymouth Crown Court. Prosecutor Paul Grumbar said Easby loitered in the Barclays branch for several minutes just after 10am. He said Easby handed the cashier a note which said: 'Give me the money or I will shoot you'. But Mr Grumbar said the woman refused, pressed an alarm and snatched the note away - which was later found to carry Easby's fingerprints. The forgetful armed raider ordered a taxi to take him between robberies - only to forget to put on his balaclava as he walked past CCTV . Paul Easby had tried to hold up a bank minutes before he went into the Londis corner shop to rob the staff at knifepoint in Plymouth, Devon. He can be seen walking into the shop without his mask on . In full view of CCTV, he walks up and down shop aisles, and makes his way to the back of the store in Plymouth . He said: 'Easby caught a taxi nearby straight to the Londis store. The cab stayed outside while Easby threatened [a worker] who was working alone in the store. 'He pointed the knife at the worker and said: 'Give me the money, I am not afraid to use it'. The court Easby left the bank empty handed then hailed a cab and went to the shop and asked the driver to wait outside. Easby was captured walking unmasked up and down the aisles on July 10 before going to a private part of the store and putting on his balaclava. He even walked past the shop assistant several times as he was crouched on the floor, stacking shelves . Thinking he has found the perfect spot, he head to the store room to put on his balaclava - seemingly unaware that he has been filmed the entire time . He then approached the cashier with a knife and forced him to open the till and leaned over and helped himself to cash. Easby then took off his balaclava just as he walked out the store before getting back into the back of the same taxi and was driven away. He changed his plea on the day of his trial only about a week after seeing the CCTV for the first time with a solicitor. Judge Simon Carr praised the 'considerable bravery' shown by the woman who ignored Easby's threat that he had a gun to press a panic alarm at the Barclays branch. He said: 'The bank cashier took four months before she could return to work and even when she did she was having nightmares.' He then approached the cashier with a knife and forced him to open the till - as the assistant pushed the panic button to alert police . Still wearing his balaclava, Easby leaned over and helped himself to cash . But he then took off his balaclava just as he walked out of the store - again in full view of CCTV cameras . He then got back into the waiting cab - whose oblivious driver pulled away and drove off only for police to stop and arrest Easby, of Plymouth, Devon, minutes later . Easby, a father-of-two from Plymouth, has been a heroin addict since his early 20s and carried out the raid while high on a cocktail of drugs. The court heard Easby had committed a string of armed robberies back in 2004, when he escaped with cash and jewellery worth £80,000 from shops in Plymouth. He turned cat burglar to break into an antiques shop in September 2010 when he shinned up a drainpipe and balanced on a model shark to get inside. After the case, DC Glenn Harrop said: 'These are serious offences and we are happy with the outcome. It is just good that nobody was hurt. Easby has reached the end of the road.'","Paul Easby tried to hold up a bank then hopped in a taxi to a nearby shop .

"New York City would look radically different today if one very big thinking engineer had his way back in 1912. In a New York Times article from that year, Dr. T. Kennard Thomson proposed, among other big changes, the complete filling-in of the East River, the extension of Manhattan by ten blocks to the south and several new plots of land including an island in New York Bay. For decades, Thomson extolled the virtues of his plan, which he called 'A Really Greater New York.' Among those virtues, he said, was room for 20 million New Yorkers--or over four times the population in 1912--and a considerable 1,400 acres of land that Thomson claimed would have a worth of $1 billion. 'A Really Greater New York': A 1912 proposal by engineer T. Kennard Thomson would have added 1,400 acres to New York City by filling in the East River, extending Manhattan over ten blocks to the south, adding new tracts of land and an island off Staten Island and adding land to Bayonne, New Jersey, among other changes . 'At first glance,' Thomson wrote in a 1916 Popular Science article, 'a project to reclaim fifty square miles of land from New York bay, to add one hundred miles of new waterfront docks, to fill in the East River, and to prepare New York for a population of twenty million, seems somewhat stupendous, does it not?' Despite his salesman-like panache, Thomson was actually a well-respected civil engineer of his day. According to Big Think, Thomson had been involved in the construction of over 20 early NYC skyscrapers and many of its bridges. But more than just a southerly extension of the island of Manhattan, filling in the East River would remove the only delineation between Manhattan and Queens--which would have grown the island several times over. However, the borough of Queens would remain. Not satisfied with simply removing a river, Thomson proposed a new East River that would run straight through the middle of of Queens. To the west would be mega-Manhattan with its ten new blocks extending nearly all the way to Staten Island and encompassing Governor's Island, which still today sits to the south of the island. Disappearing islands: Present day Governors Island would have been engulfed by Thomson's plan to extend Manhattan southward nearly all the way to Staten Island . Governor's Island today is a popular destination for warm weather leisure activities, though it remains accessible only by boat or ferry . Thomson fought for decades to get his plan recognized as a viable future for New York. He even pared it down to a more modest proposal by 1930, but it never caught on and the borders of the city remain nearly the same today as they were in Thomson's day . To the east of Staten Island, a new island and two new tracts of land would create what the map calls a 'new entry point' to the city along with a new harbor. New Jersey also factored into Thomson's plan, which would have extended the city of Bayonne far deeper into the Hudson toward Manhattan. 'This will mean an addition of one hundred miles of new water-front. New York's City Hall would become the center of a really greater New York, having a radius of twenty-five miles, and within that circle there would be ample room for a population of twenty-five millions, the entire project to be carried out within a few years,' Thomson wrote. While he admitted that his plan would cost even more than another massive engineering feat of the day--the Panama Canal--Thomson believed the economic benefits would almost immediately refill the city's coffers. Sadly for Thomson, his plan never caught on enough to come to fruition--even by 1930, when he'd reduced his grand vision from 'A Really Greater New York' to a smaller scale plan he dubbed more modestly 'New Manhattan.' Even bigger than present day: Thomson hoped to add to New York land worth some $1 billion and enough space quadruple its population to 20 to 25 million .","The 1912 plan first appeared in a New York Times proposal penned by mainstream engineer T. Kennard Thomson .

"Police officer Osman Iqbal was jailed after he was exposed him as being at the centre of an organised crime group which ran brothels in exclusive areas of London . A police officer who led a secret double life as the boss of an organised crime gang was caught out by his own force bosses - after driving into work in a £170,000 Ferrari. Osman Iqbal, 37, earned around £40,000 a year as a sergeant for West Midlands Police responding to 999 calls in Kings Heath, Birmingham. But unbeknown to his colleagues he had links to a string of brothels and peddled class A drugs in exclusive areas of London. Iqbal is now serving a jail sentence of seven years and two months after being imprisoned last September with seven other gang members. His own workmates raised suspicions when Iqbal arrived for work in the £170,000 Ferrari 458 supercar and an anti-corruption team began probing his bank accounts. A court last September heard how Iqbal was caught when the Serious and Organised Crime Unit linked him with convicted armed robber Talib Hussain, 33. It was through him that he had access to a fleet of high end vehicles and both men and the cars were connected to to two fake businesses - City Chauffeurs Ltd and Capital Event Management. The bank accounts of the companies were being used by the pair to launder hundreds of thousands of pounds. Police discovered the money was coming from chip and PIN machines in Covent Garden and Marylebone in London. Two properties were put under surveillance in a joint operation with the Metropolitan Police and they were identified as brothels. Iqbal and Hussain and their associates Atif Hussain and Asri Hussain were involved in an elaborate scheme whereby they organised for clients to be picked up from strip bars where they would be offered drugs and women and driven back to one of the brothels. Once there they were overcharged on their bank cards  - but failed to report the crimes because of the shame of how they had been duped. His own workmates raised suspicions when Iqbal arrived for work in the £170,000 Ferrari 458 supercar and an anti-corruption team began probing his bank accounts . On September 19 2014 he was sentenced to seven years, two months after admitting conspiracy to manage a brothel, conspiracy to possess Class A drugs with intent to supply and conspiracy to money launder. More recently the force discovered that he had been asked by Nahiem Ajmal, a Birmingham religious leader, to get information from police computer systems on behalf of his friend Sajad Khan. Although due to safeguarding in place he was unable to access the police log he was charged with five counts of misconduct in a public office and pleaded guilty to three counts at an earlier hearing. He was back in court on Wednesday where he faced three new charges of misconduct in a public office. Iqbal, of  Birmingham, pleaded guilty and admitted making unauthorised attempts to access police intelligence systems while serving with West Midlands police. Iqbal's cousins Talib Hussain, and Atif Hussain admitted conspiring to act or assist in the management of a brothel. Talib, 34, of Hodge Hill, was jailed for eight years and four months. Atif, 27, of Saltley, was jailed for four years and two months . He will be sentenced at a later date. Chief Inspector Martin Brennan, from West Midlands Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said the cars and greed gave the men away. He said: 'This was a highly-organised and well-orchestrated criminal network but what makes it particularly reprehensible is that fact a serving police officer was at the centre of it all. 'Iqbal and his associates generated their income by running 'exclusive' brothels and peddling Class A drugs. 'For them, it was all about the money and the fast cars and they didn't care who they were exploiting and what laws they were breaking in the process. Cousin Asri, 25, was also jailed for three years – consecutive to a ten-year sentence he received for conspiracy to commit robberies . 'Their greed was their downfall and when they were seen driving around in their supercars it didn't take us long to piece together exactly what they were up to and take action.

"The Irish tourist who was knocked unconscious by his brother in a one-punch attack is conscious and no longer on life support. Barry Lyttle, 33, was arrested and charged after allegedly punching his younger brother Patrick, 31, at about 3am on Saturday in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district. Patrick was rushed to hospital and was in a critical but stable condition while in an induced coma for most of the week. But on Friday afternoon, St Vincent's Hospital spokesman David Faktor told Daily Mail Australia there had been 'good news'. Scroll down for video . He's awake! Patrick Lyttle, 31, has woken up from his coma six days after his brother Barry Lyttle, 33, (left) allegedly struck him . Charged: Barry Lyttle, 33, was charged with reckless grievous bodily harm and was granted bail on Monday . Relieved father: Oliver Lyttle, right, visited Australia with his son, Barry. His other son, Patrick, is now out of a coma . 'He's conscious. He's still in ICU (the Intensive Care Unit) but he's stable,' Mr Faktor said. 'He's been taken off life support. He's sitting up.' Brother Barry and father Oliver have been a constant presence by Patrick's bedside in Sydney's inner east. Mr Faktor was unable to comment on whether Patrick was talking. After a weekend spent in police custody, Barry was granted bail at Sydney Central Court on Monday charged with reckless grievous bodily harm. A tearful Oliver Lyttle told reporters on Monday his sons had loved each other since they were children. 'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done. 'I want to thank everybody for the way things have went (in court today) and their sympathy.' As part of his bail conditions, Barry had to hand over his Irish passport to authorities. He is not allowed to approach his brother within 12 hours of consuming alcohol. He is required to live with his Australian aunty at a Blacktown address and he will have to report to Blacktown Police Station each day. He will face Downing Centre Local Court once more on January 20. Barry and Oliver arrived in Australia on December 29 to visit Patrick, who arrived in Sydney for an Australian-wide trip last June. The siblings from Belfast in Ireland had been dining with their father earlier in the evening before the two young men went to a bar for a drink. The family of Barry Lyttle, including his 74-year-old father Oliver (left) arrived at Central Local Court in Sydney on Monday morning . The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) had been at dinner with their father earlier in the evening before the incident unfolded . Police say Barry punched his younger brother in the head during an argument causing him to fall backwards and hit the footpath. Paramedics treated Patrick at the scene before taking him to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Police described the incident as a 'family tragedy' and Detective Superintendent Michael Fitzgerald said the 'pain in their father's eyes was indescribable'. The incident was caught on CCTV cameras and Barry reportedly screamed in shock and distress when he realised the extent of his brother's injuries. Alcohol was not a factor in the fight with Barry's blood alcohol concentration reading in the low range. The fight was said to have occurred after a minor argument. In a series of  Facebook posts before the incident, the brothers had previously expressed how excited they were about their Australian reunion. Patrick has been travelling around Australia for the past six months and often received messages from Barry advising him to 'stay safe'. In anticipation of the two meeting up in Sydney Barry posted to Patrick on Facebook: 'Not be long bro! See ya soon. Safe trip the pair of ya!' Barry wiped away tears as he sat unshaven in a blue jumper in the dock as agonised relatives, including his father Oliver, watched the court proceedings . Patrick Lyttle was treated by paramedics at the scene in Sydney's inner city, where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit . Two Irish brothers were involved in a confrontation outside a nightclub in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner city which has left the younger brother fighting for his life . A little over a month before the incident, Barry Lyttle messaged his little brother Patrick, who was travelling around Australia and told him to keep safe . The brothers were eagerly waiting their reunion in Australia in January. Patrick had been travelling around the country since early June . In October Barry Lyttle again told his brother Patrick to say safe via a message on Social Media . Emergency services rushed to the scene after reports the 32-year-old victim was in cardiac arrest .

"David Cameron today vowed to turn England's northern cities into 'powerhouses' like US giants Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. The Prime Minister wants Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Liverpool to work together to match London and compete with other global cities. He said the country should be less reliant on London and more like the US, which has several 'major centres of industry' other than New York. 'We can only have a strong British economy if no part of the country is left behind,' Mr Cameron said. David Cameron and George Osborne want to turn Manchester (left) into Britain's equivalent of LA (right) Mr Cameron made the remarks on a two-day tour of the North West with George Osborne to promote the idea of a 'northern powerhouse'. He said: 'In the USA they've got major centres of industry not just in New York but in Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta. 'That is what we should aspire to in the UK: economic might not just held in one city but spread right across our country.' Downing Street said that in 2013 the North West had the joint fastest growth in output per head in the UK and has seen an average of 200 more people in employment per day over the past year. Mr Cameron is due to say: 'We need a strong London, but we need a northern powerhouse too. 'The top 600 cities in the world contain just 20 per cent of global population but create 60 per cent of global GDP. 'When you get that critical mass of people it amplifies jobs and ideas and businesses. The cities and towns of the north of England can have that critical mass. 'If we join them together as a team and let them pool their strengths, if we back their scientists and innovators, if we back their thriving cultural life, make them great places to live and give them powerful elected voices, then we can create a northern powerhouse'.

The Government believes the great northern cities of England have the potential to match Chicago's success . Mr Osborne said a growing north-south divide 'is not inevitable, it is not something we should accept; it is instead something we have in our power to overcome'. He said: 'Rebalancing our national economy, ensuring that the economic future of the north is as bright, if not brighter, than other parts of the UK, is the ambition we should set ourselves. 'We achieve that not by pulling down our capital city, or diminishing its success. Having one of the greatest global cities on earth, located two hundred miles to our south, should be an asset, not a weakness.'","The PM wants England's northern cities to work together to match London .

"One of the brothers suspected of carrying out the Charlie Hebdo attack was mentored by a terrorist linked to London’s notorious Finsbury Park mosque. The revelation will raise concerns about British links to this week’s terrorist atrocity in France. Cherif Kouachi, 32, met Djamel Beghal, 50, who was once accused of being Osama bin Laden’s main European recruiter, while in prison in Paris. Mentored: Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, met Djamel Beghal (right), 50, who was once accused of being Osama bin Laden’s main European recruiter, while in prison in Paris . Notorious: Kouachi was mentored by terrorist Beghal, who has links to London's Finsbury Park mosque . He maintained his links with the Al Qaeda lynchpin after being released from jail. Kouachi, who is on the run after Wednesday’s attack on the Paris satirical magazine, was secretly photographed by French intelligence officers meeting Beghal while he was under house arrest in Murat in central France in April 2010. Also present were two other convicted terrorists, jihadi recruiter Ahmed Laidouni and Algerian Armed Islamic Group member Farid Melouk. Beghal attended hate cleric Abu Qatada’s prayer meetings in London, and is also said to have been a ‘constant presence’ at the Finsbury Park mosque in the late 1990s, when it was Abu Hamza’s base. He allegedly recruited the shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, the ‘20th hijacker’ in the 9/11 attacks, at the London mosque.

Beghal, who also had links to Leicester, is also said to have met one of Osama bin Laden’s key deputies at the former Al Qaeda leader’s base in Afghanistan. The terror leader spent ten years in prison in France for planning attacks. He was only released in 2010. Reda Hassaine, who worked as a paid MI5 informant inside the Finsbury Park mosque in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said Beghal was a well-known figure there in this period. He said Beghal had connections to both Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza, and had been influenced by their teachings. ‘Their warped view of the world has filtered down through him to a new generation,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘What happened in Paris was the legacy of Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza. ‘A completely new generation, who have never met these people in London, have learned their ideology indirectly and are now willing to die in jihad.’","Revelation raises concerns about UK links to terrorist atrocity in France .

"Professional cyclist and surfer Tito Tomasi, 29, ditched the skis and decided to race down a mountain in the Alps on a specially-adapted bike. The sportsman, from Nice, France, then slalomed his way through the icy alpine trees in the picturesque forest nearby. Photographer Alex Buisse, 29, from Chamonix, France, braved the wind and -3C temperatures to capture Tino's daredevil antics on camera. Tomasi pedalled at breakneck speeds for four hours to descend the mountain, and as the picture on the right shows, navigating through deep snow was problematic . Some of the journey was impossible to cycle, so Tomasi was forced to haul his bike up high gradients, all by himself . The professional cyclist and surfer  pushed his Rocky Mountain Blizzard Fat Bike to the limit on the slopes of the Aravis mountains . The pair scaled 2,624ft (800m) up the Pointe de Merdassier peak, which stands at 7,588ft (2,313m), to take the pictures at 6am. Tito then pedalled at breakneck speeds for four hours to descend the mountain before tearing through the trees. Alex said: 'Tito pushed it to its limits on an exposed ridge and on steep slopes. Tomasi raced down the ridges on his specially-adapted bike as the sun rose over the Alps mountains for a spectacular experience . Tomasi's daring ride was captured by photographer Alex Buisse, 29, from Chamonix, France, who braved the wind and and freezing cold . Tomasi was forced to slalom his way through a forest at the base of the Alps, and right, the extent of depth of snow is evident . 'Climbing up the ridge by night, in deep snow at times, with the wind blowing and carrying our respective equipments was definitely a big challenge. 'But seeing the beautiful sunrise made it all okay though.' Alex, who used a Nikon D4 in the shoot, insisted that Tito risked it all to top 20mph on the slopes. Alex said: 'This was an experiment to see how far Tito could push the bike, as it isn't really designed for such vertical and exposed mountain terrain. Tomasi scaled 800 metres of the Pointe de Merdassier peak, which stands at 2313 metres, with photographer Buisse following his every step . Tomasi admitted to crashing a lot, but judging by the terrain and heights he scaled, that is hardly surprising . How the French cyclist even managed to cycle through such thick snow hiding the unknown is remarkable . 'And we had to stop a little because avalanche conditions were getting too dangerous. 'But even though Tito crashed quite a lot, he was fine thanks to the soft snow.'

"The father of the ISIS militant suspected of being 'Jihadi John' today wept as he admitted plotting with Osama bin Laden to blow up U.S. embassies. Adel Abdul Bary, 54, pleaded guilty to charges of making a threat to use an explosive device and conspiracy to murder Americans at Manhattan federal court. His charges were in relation to the 1998 plot to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa, which left 224 people dead, including 12 Americans. The Egyptian lawyer, whose son, British rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, is suspected of beheading three hostages on video in Syria, made the guilty pleas in a bid to greatly reduce his sentence. Scroll down for video . On trial: Adel Abdul Bary, 54, today pleaded guilty to charges of making a threat to use an explosive device and conspiracy to murder Americans at Manhattan federal court. Above, a drawing of  Bary in court today . Weeping: According to his indictment, Bary was made head of the London cell of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in  1996 . Father and son: Bary (right), whose son, British rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (left), is suspected of being 'Jihadi John', made the guilty pleas in a bid to greatly reduce his sentence, but the deal was put on hold . But U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan put the deal on hold, saying he wanted to hear further arguments before dropping more serious terrorism charges that carry a possible life sentence. Today, Bary, who allegedly carried out the plot from a London cell of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, shook his head and wept as he admitted that he had essentially acted as an al-Qaida spokesman following the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. He told the judge he had contacted the media to claim responsibility for the attacks and later put reporters in touch with al-Qaida leaders bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. 'I arranged to transmit messages from media personnel to my co-conspirators, al-Zawahiri and bin Laden,' he said, reading from a statement. Wiping his eyes with tissues, he added: 'I agreed with others … to kill American citizens anywhere in the world — either civilian or military,' according to the New York Post. Bary, who earlier told the judge he was facing treatment for depression, is charged with 213 counts of premeditated murder for the Nairobi bombing and 11 more for the attack in Dar es Salaam. ISIS militant: The younger Bary, 23, left his million-dollar home in Maida Vale, London, to fight with ISIS, which has run rampage through Syria and Iraq. Above, he is seen rapping before fleeing the country to fight . Beheading: 'Jihadi John' has beheaded three hostages on video in Syria, including U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff . He is also charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and several lesser charges, and faces life in prison if convicted. Bary, who has a long history of terror involvement, was imprisoned and tortured in Egypt following the murder of President Anwar Sadat in 1981, according to a sympathetic profile of his wife which appeared in the Guardian last year. After years of going in and out of prison in Egypt, during which he managed to gain a degree and become a respected human rights lawyer with ties to Amnesty International, he managed to leave the country and in 1991, the year Bary was born, he applied for political asylum in Britain. His family joined him after it was granted in 1993. Two years later, he was sentenced to death in absentia for a 1995 plot to blow up a market in Cairo's bazaar district. In a separate Egyptian trial in 1999 he was also sentenced to life in prison. According to the Guardian, he was then arrested soon after the August 7, 1998 embassy bombings. Fighter: Abdel-Majed Bary (pictured performing ISIS's one-finger salute while holding a gun) showed his barbarism when he posted a grisly picture of himself holding a severed head to his Twitter account . 'There was a dawn raid by British police in white contamination suits, brandishing truncheons and breaking down the front door. Ragaa and the children were traumatized. 'A dozen or so men were suddenly in their bedrooms, shouting for her husband, searching the children's clothes, tearing out pages from any books with telephone numbers. 'Adel was led away, and Ragaa, hurriedly putting on her black hijab and abaya, was told to get into a bus with her five children, one of whom was a small baby.' But British authorities found nothing to tie Bary to the embassy bombings and he was soon released. He was charged with having unlawful gas canisters but was acquitted at trial, the Guardian said. He was arrested again when the United States applied for his extradition on the same charges that the British had dismissed and he was then held in Long Lartin and Manchester prisons, at one time going on hunger strike to protest what he considered racist treatment by guards. Attack: Bary's charges were in relation to the 1998 plot to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa, which left 224 people dead, including 12 Americans. Above, rescuers carry an injured man from the wreckage of the attack . According to his indictment in the embassy bombing case, al-Zawahiri appointed him head of the London cell of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad in May 1996. The next year he leased an office in Beethoven Street, just off London's Kilburn Lane, which became bin Laden's 'media information office,' the indictment says. It was also set up to ' to provide a cover for activity in support of al Qaeda's 'military' activities, including the recruitment of military trainees, the disbursement of funds and the procurement of necessary equipment (including satellite telephones) and necessary services. 'In addition, the London office served as a conduit for messages, including reports on military and security matters from various al Qaeda cells, including the Kenyan cell, to al Qaeda's headquarters,' the indictment says. Bary 'made efforts to facilitate the delivery of fake travel documents to co-conspirators who were members or associates of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Holland and Albania,' it continues. A body is carried from the wreckage in Nairobi after the bombing, which was also plotted by Osama bin Laden . Under the latest plea deal, Bary, who was extradited from Britain to the U.S. in 2012 and is currently being held in a high-security jail in Manhattan, would face a maximum of 25 years in prison. He would also qualify to receive credit for the more than 14 years he was held behind bars in  Britain and be allowed to request to serve the remainder of his time in another country. Prosecutors told the judge they agreed to the deal because Bary had no direct role in the killings. Meanwhile, defense attorney Andrew Patel said: 'I believe this is just decision.' Bary had been scheduled to go on trial in November with Abu Anas al-Libi, who was once on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. Al-Libi was snatched off the streets of Tripoli last year and brought to New York to face terrorism charges in the embassy bombing case. When asked after today's trial if Bary's decision to plead guilty was anything to do with 'his son Abdel-Majed's situation', his lawyer Andrew Patel declined comment. Terrorist: Bary told the judge he had contacted the media to claim responsibility for the attacks in 1998 and later put reporters in touch with al-Qaida leaders Osama bin Laden (pictured) and Ayman al-Zawahiri . The younger Bary, 23, left his million-dollar home in Maida Vale, London, to fight with ISIS, which has run rampage through Syria and Iraq. He showed his barbarism when he posted a grisly picture of himself holding a severed head to his Twitter account. He captioned it 'Chillin' with my other homie, or what's left of him.' In another picture, captioned 'Fireworks', he stands in front of dozens of bags of plastic explosives. Videos posted to YouTube show Bary, who used the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny, praising his father in rap, while other lyrics express his disgust with drugs and drink. American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines, were all beheaded by 'Jihadi John' in graphic footage that was released by ISIS online. Last Saturday, a second British hostage, Alan Henning, was threatened by the terror group. The trial continues.","Adel Abdul Bary, 54, pleaded guilty to plotting to blow up U.S. embassies .

"The stripper who tried to unlock her husband's handcuffs using an earring in the back of a cop car has been sentenced to 18 months under house arrest. Melissa Schneider, 27, and Jonathan Kokontis, 25 - who are parents to a four-year-old boy - were arrested in September following a series of vehicle burglaries in Seminole County, Florida. En route to the police station, a bizarre video captured by the patrol car surveillance system showed the pair's 30-minute attempt to break free - using an earring. Scroll down for video . House arrest: Melissa Schneider, 27, tearfully agreed to a plea bargain involving 18 months' house arrest . Caught: Jonathan Kokontis, 25, told his girlfriend Melissa Schneider, 27 that he would be going to prison for a long time minutes after they were arrested and put in a patrol car in Seminole County, Florida . Emotional: She leans her head into his chest and starts to cry, prompting Kokontis to consider the best way to get out of the car . Kokontis, a two-time ex-convict, could be heard telling Schneider that he would be going to jail for a long time due to his lengthy criminal record. Schneider started crying - so Kokontis suggested an escape. At first Schneider tries to reach through the bars to open the door. Then, after a passionate kiss, one of her gold hoops fall onto the seat, and Kokontis tries to use it as a key. Escape bid: His first idea is for her to try and reach through the bars in the window and open the door lever. But she says she can't do it . Plan B: Kokontis then takes his girlfriend's earring and tries - and fails - to pick the lock on his handcuffs. To hid the jewelry he puts it in his mouth, but then spits it back out . Thwarted: The deputy then opens the door and asks about the earring. He believes Schneider's excuse . The plot was foiled after a deputy spotted the earring and confiscated it - and though Kokontis pushed his way out the car and fled, he was later captured. On Thursday, three weeks after Kokontis was jailed for 30 years, Schneider pleaded guilty to aiding escape and tearfully agreed to a plea bargain, involving 18 months' house arrest and rehabilitation for heroin addiction. After the hearing, Schneider told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I just lost my husband for 30 years. ...The judge is so mean.' Kokontis, who was jailed on December 17, managed to escape after asking the deputy to loosen his handcuffs then pushing past him. He was later captured trying to steal a car that wouldn't start. A police dog bit him during the arrest. The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to escape, battery of a law enforcement officer and four counts of burglary. Desperation: Kokontis then leans out of the door and asks the officer to loosen his cuffs after all other attempts have failed . Push: The felon, in one last bid for freedom, runs past the officer and briefly escapes custody. He was returned to the vehicle a short time later .","Melissa Schneider, 27, tried to help husband Jonathan Kokontis, 25, escape after they were arrested for vehicle burglaries in Seminole County .

"A driver on the northbound Freeway 55 in Orange County, California noticed another driver going extremely slowly and hitting the side walls of the highway. The vehicle was quickly pulled over by a police officer, and what fellow drivers on the road witnessed once the man opened his door was almost certainly one of the worst drinking and driving episodes that southern California has ever seen. The officer had no need to use a breathalyzer in this case. Police were called on the northbound Freeway 55 to assist a driver who was hitting the highway sidewalls . The man was so intoxicated, he couldn’t even stay standing up as he emerged from the vehicle. The police officer pulled the man by his arms to the freeway's shoulder, yelling at him to get up. After several failed attempts, the man manages to regain his footing - only to stumble again and be forced to grab the side rail for support.

"Dwarfing houses and trees, these enormous bonfire stacks have completely reshaped Belfast's skyline. The huge tyre mounds, many of which are more than 100ft tall, have been built as the city nervously prepares for an annual  Protestant loyalist celebration. Hundreds of fires will be set alight at midnight tonight as Protestant loyalists commemorate the Battle of the Boyne. Scroll down for video . Massive: The skyline of Belfast has been completely altered by these enormous bonfires which have sprung up across the city in preparation for an annual Protestant loyalist celebration. A young man can be seen at the stop of this one . Huge: This bonfire is more than 100 feet high in the New Mossley area of  Belfast.  Hundreds of bonfires will be set alight at midnight Thursday as Protestant loyalists celebrate July 12 . The annual demonstration sees . thousands of Orange Order members and bandsmen go on parade across . Northern Ireland - which has sparked serious rioting and violence in recent years between loyalists and nationalists. A total of 550 parades are due to take place throughout Northern Ireland on Friday with 43 deemed to be contentious, resulting in hundreds of extra police officers been drafted on to the streets. In recent years police . officers have been battered with bricks, bottles and petrol bombs. Last year shots were also fired and a pipe bomb hurled at police lines in the Ardoyne. The celebration marks the defeat of the Catholic King James, by the Protestant William of Orange in 1690, which was one of the major turning points in Irish history. Taking place in1690, and known as the Battle of the Boyne, around . 36,000 troops commanded by King William III defeated an army of . approximately 25,000 troops led by King James II along the river Boyne . near the town of Drogheda. The victory of Protestant William over . the forces of England's Catholic king created a Protestant ascendancy . in the Emerald Isle - most notably in the Ulster region. The battle took place on 1 July in the Julian calendar, which is equivalent to 11 July in the Gregorian calendar, and the celebration is held each year on the 12th. Commemoration: The bonfires celebrate a major turning point in Irish history known as the Battle of the Boyne . Decorative: Union flags adorn this enormous tyre stack which will be set alight as loyalists celebrate July 12, remembering the defeat of the catholic King James, by the Protestant William of Orange in 1690 . In . Northern Ireland, the Eleventh Night refers to the night before the . Twelfth of July, the annual Protestant commemoration of the famous . battle. On this night, large towering bonfires are lit - with . Irish flags placed on top - in many Protestant, unionist and loyalist . communities where it is also known as 'bonfire night'. Sometimes stacked by their thousands, the tyres in such bonfires around . the region cast a plume of fire - and thick, toxic smoke caused by the . burning rubber - high into the night sky. The PSNI chief constable has revealed he is drafting in an extra 630 police officers from forces across the UK to help keep the peace on the streets over the Twelfth. Mr Baggott denied claims that the unprecedented move was an indication he was concerned about serious disorder in places like Ardoyne but said the scale of this year's Twelfth event was unique. The 30 units of specially trained additional public order officers will be used as a 'strategic reserve' and will be deployed to less sensitive areas accompanied by an armed PSNI officer. Unionist anger has intensified in recent days over a decision to ban an Orange Order parade past a sectarian flash point. While Orangemen will march past the . Ardoyne shops on the Crumlin Road on Friday morning on their way to the . annual Twelfth demonstration, the Parades Commission adjudication body . has banned them from taking the same route on their return journey in . the afternoon. The interface area has been the scene of serious rioting on the Twelfth in recent years. Head for heights: This man adds the finishing touches to a huge bonfire in the New Mossley area of Belfast . Standing tall: The stack can be see through this tyre held by 12-year-old Jack Lindsay . The Orange Order has branded the commission's decision ""ludicrous"" but urged supporters not to react with violence. However, the hardline collective has . been widely blamed for orchestrating violence which has seen police . battered with bricks, bottles and petrol bombs during violent clashes. Shots were also fired and a pipe bomb hurled at police lines in Ardoyne last year. The decision by the Commission is the . first time it has ruled that the Orange Order cannot hold an evening . parade past Ardoyne. It came after intensive talks with nationalist . residents failed to reach agreement. With many communities building the huge tyre stacks, not everything has gone to plan. A 40ft stack of tyres collapsed on an estate 10 miles outside the city on Tuesday. The . structure, comprising more than 25 layers of tyres and pallets, came . tumbling to the ground under its own weight, according to website UTV, . in Ballycraigy, Antrim, . It is illegal to burn . the tyres, which emit toxic fumes - and bonfire committee workers had . previously removed stacks in the area on safety grounds. This 40ft stack of tyres collapsed on an estate in Ballycraigy, Antrim, Tuesday. It is pictured just before it fell . Going down: The tyre stack can be seen leaning as it begins to fall . Wrecked: The pyre came crashing down just days before it was due to be lit . Their . concerns are echoed by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service . (NIFRS), which advises those building and attending the bonfires to . consider the risks. 'If we are called out to attend a . bonfire-related incident, I am asking the community for their support to . ensure that firefighters are able to carry out their job without fear . of attack or harassment,' Assistant Chief Fire Officer Dale Ashford . said. Last year, there was a significant drop in the number of . bonfire-related incidents - down from 49 call-outs between 6pm on July . 11 and 8am on July 12 in 2011, to 29 during the same period in 2012.","Huge tyre stacks more than 100-ft tall built ahead of  Protestant celebration .

"A hairless cat had a lucky escape after being found with an arrow shot through her head. Akila, a seven-year-old calico Sphynx, was found by her owner, Tyra Bulluck, 40, cowering in bushes in a neighbor's yard with a seven inch arrow that had been fired right between the terrified cat’s eyes. Akila, a purebred calico Sphynx cat that lives strictly indoors, had a lucky escape when a seven inch arrow deflected off her skull lodging itself in skin and only causing a superficial wound . The projectile had deflected off Akila's skull, only going under the surface of the skin. Had it hit from a different angle and pierced the skull, it would have meant instant death. Akila, a strictly indoor cat, had got out of the family’s home in Riverside, Florida, 12 miles south of Tampa, on Tuesday, and it was not until Wednesday morning that her owners made the disturbing discovery. Akila underwent a 45-minute operation to remove the arrow and was able to go home with owner Tyra Bulluck (right) the same day. Bulluck has since contacted the local Sheriff's office about the attack . Until then their primary concern had been that the purebred had been outside on what had been a chilly night for Florida. Akila was rushed to the Animal Coalition of Tampa where she underwent emergency surgery performed by veterinarian Elaine Foley to remove the arrow. The 45-minute operation was successful and Akila was allowed to go home. ‘She's a very, very lucky girl,’ said Bulluck. It is still unknown who shot the arrow into Akila's head, and Bulluck contacted the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office about the attack. Police are  testing the arrow for fingerprints and other clues as part of an animal cruelty investigation .

"An Oklahoma woman has learned the hard way not to leave her wedding rings lying around in the presence of her omnivorous Labrador.

The family took their sticky-pawed black Labrador to Dr Rodney Robards at the Southern Hills Veterinary Hospital, who confirmed their suspicions, reported Fox 23. An X-ray of Sierra's stomach showed Mrs Lamb's two rings worth $23,000 lodged inside. Dr Robards decided to perform emergency surgery Wednesday rather than wait for the jewelry to come out the natural way for fear that Sierra’s intestines would be damaged in the process.

"His feet aren’t much shorter than their legs. So little wonder that the children of St Michael’s were treading carefully when Sultan Kosen came to visit yesterday. Fortunately for them, the world’s tallest man is a giant of the gentle variety and careful where he puts his size 28s. Tall order: Sultan Kosen, who is 8ft 3 ins tall and has size 28 feet, stands proud with pupils at St. Michael's RC School in Twickenham . Pupils had to clamber up a climbing frame to make eye contact with the 29-year-old who is 8ft 3in tall. Mr Kosen, a farmer, visited the . school in Twickenham, south-west London, after it  won a Guinness World . Records Educational Programme competition. The Turkish farmer impressed teachers and pupils by ‘placing’ a ball in a basketball hoop while barely having to stretch. Pupils crooked their necks as they stared up at the giant man, who walks with a stick and is almost three times their size. Mr Kosen signed autographs and held a question and answer session with the youngsters and said he felt very welcome at the school . Sultan said: 'Some people don’t know what to do when they meet me but everyone at St Michael’s has been so friendly and warm. 'I wanted to share with kids it’s OK to be different.' Year six teacher Ruth Foley said: 'The children were all in absolute awe of Sultan, he is lovely, like a gentle giant. 'This memorable experience will stay with us all for the rest of our lives.' Mr Kosen impressed teachers and pupils by 'placing' a ball in a basketball hoop while barely having to stretch . Sultan’s hands measure a massive 10.8 inches across and his feet are 13.7 inches long, which are also world records. He is one of only ten people ever to top 8 feet and the first in a decade. He became the world’s tallest man in August 2009, when he shot past China’s Bao Xishun at 7ft 9ins. Sultan suffers from a rare disorder called pituitary gigantism, which causes his body to continually produce the growth hormone. Hanging out: The 29-year-old suffers from a rare disorder called pituitary gigantism, which causes his body to continually produce the growth hormone . His condition is believed to have been caused by a tumour in the pituitary gland. Doctors thought they had cured him in 2008 when they removed the tumour but he continued to grow by half and inch a year. Now medics say he has finally stopped growing. Sultan grew normally until he was ten but the tumour then caused him to develop the medical condition. When other children were little more than 4 feet, he was already well over 6 feet. His family are all ‘normal’ size. Sultan last visited the UK two years ago, when he said: 'The kids used to tease me and I found that very difficult. 'But now I am really proud of being tall.'

"Nikki Thomas (pictured) becomes RAF's first ever female commander of Tornado bomber squadron . The RAF's first ever female commander of a Tornado bomber squadron is set to lead airstrikes against Islamic State. Wing Commander Nikki Thomas made history after being put in charge of No 12 (bomber) Squadron based at RAF Marham, Norfolk. She will take command of at least 250 highly-trained RAF staffers, including 30 of Britain's top gun pilots and flying weapons system operators - dubbed whizzos. The 36-year-old will also be leading her squadron when they fly to Iraq this summer to support Operation Shader in the fight against Isis. Wing Commander Thomas is being trained in gruelling 'escape and evasion' techniques to prepare her for being shot down behind enemy lines. The position was handed to her at a formal parade which saw the No 2 (Army Cooperation) Squadron change from a Tornado to a Typhoon Force. The Number 12 (Bomber) squadron has now taken over as a Tornado force. Wing Commander Thomas, who specialises in flying a two-seater £9.4million Tornado, said: 'This has been a superb day and the guys and girls on parade today were fantastic. 'It has been a very proud day for all those involved and I'm very much looking forward to working with the personnel of this truly fantastic Squadron.' Wing Commander Thomas joined the RAF as a Navigator in 2000 after graduating with an Aeronautical Engineering degree at Loughborough University and has continued up the ranks ever since.

During the incident at around 7pm, the man - who was 'wearing a hoodie' according to family members - allegedly pulled a screen off the bedroom window and reached through to the little girl. 'He leaned in the window and then told her to come toward him,' the youngster's aunt, Adriana, told KTLA 5, adding that her entire family had been in the house during the 'frightening' attack. Shocked: 'He leaned in the window and told her to come toward him,' the girl's aunt, Adriana (pictured), said . Emergency response: The infant was rescued when her father and uncle reportedly heard a commotion and ran out of the house, chasing the alleged kidnapper down the street. Above, deputies at the scene Thursday . The man then grabbed the child and dragged her away from the house in the 24200 block of Arch Street in the Newhall area of Santa Clarita, before running down the street with her, deputies said. However, after the girl's father and uncle heard a commotion and realized she was missing, they reportedly chased her attacker down the road until they were just feet away from him. 'I actually … ran behind him,' said the girl’s uncle, whose name is Jesus. 'I think he heard my footsteps and then he turned around quickly and asked me if this was my daughter.' After Jesus told the kidnapper that the girl was his daughter in an attempt to get her back, the man handed her back to him and made to flee, her relatives said. Official: During a press conference on Friday morning, Sheriff's Deputy Joshua Dubin (pictured) described the incident as a 'random kidnapping' that involved the suspect 'breaking out a window screen' at the girl's home . But he was stopped when the girl's father suddenly tackled him, knocking him to the ground before restraining him. When deputies arrived at the scene, they were able to take the man into custody. In the statement, the Sheriff's Department said that the girl had been safely returned to her relatives and was startled, but not harmed. It added that deputies have set up a perimeter at the scene. During a press conference on Friday morning, deputy Joshua Dubin described the incident as a 'scary' and 'random kidnapping' that involved the suspect 'breaking out a window screen'. Although the names of the girl and suspect have not been released, officials have said there is no apparent relationship between them, CBS reported. An investigation is ongoing.

"Older people with memory problems can boost their brainpower with fish oil supplements, say researchers. Healthy people with mild memory deficits of events in their past life, so-called episodic memory, had improved recall after six months of treatment. A new overview says the omega-3 fatty acid DHA has most benefit for people with existing memory problems, particularly when they are coping with physical or mental stress. Experts believe supplements rich in DHA from fish oils or other marine sources might slow or prevent mental decline as it is found in reduced amounts in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Scroll down for video . Supplements rich in the omega-3 fatty acid DHA from fish oils might slow mental decline as it is thought to help nerve cells communicate with each other . But here have been conflicting results from studies, with some showing no benefit from supplements in dementia patients. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that is thought to help nerve cells communicate with each other. The richest source of the nutrient is oily fish, such as herring, mackerel and sardines. Britons are currently advised to eat at least one portion of oily fish a week but figures show just one in three do so. In an overview of evidence, scientists from the US and Canada said several studies had looked at DHA supplements and their effect on memory. The MIDAS study involved of 485 healthy elderly people who complained of memory problems, says a report in the journal Prostaglandins Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids. The findings showed 24 weeks of taking marine oil supplements led to ‘significant improvements’ in memory test scores compared with those who had dummy tablets. ‘It appears that benefits of DHA are best observed during ageing when there is some mild cognitive impairment or memory complaint or perhaps when a person is exposed to certain chronic physical or mental stressors’ says the overview. The best dietary source of omega 3 fatty acids is oily fish because the human body cannot produce omega-3 fatty acids. The richest source of the nutrient is oily fish, such as herring, mackerel (pictured) and sardines . White fish is also a healthy food including cod, haddock and plaice although it contains lower levels of essential fatty acids. Dr Carrie Ruxton, independent public health nutritionist who reviewed the latest evidence for supplements manufacturer Equazen, said oily fish consumption was falling. On average, Britons were eating around 90g weekly compared with the government’s recommended levels of 140g weekly. She said ‘Studies have variously shown that fish oils lead to better performance in working and verbal memory indicating the potential to delay the onset of cognitive decline and that supplementation with DHA could improve learning and memory function. ‘Two thirds of Briton never eat oily fish, they do not have omega 3 in their diet and supplements are a good alternative. ‘We know that people with the greatest cognitive decline have the least amount of omega-3 in their diet.’","Supplements rich in DHA from fish oils might slow  mental decline .

"The Today show's presenting team brought a bit of brightness to their viewers this morning, when they shared images of themselves as young children and placed them alongside pictures of their own kids, and their parents, in order to see the similarities in appearance between the different generations. Savannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer, Carson Daly, Al Roker, Tamron Hall and Natalie Morales all took part in the segment, which saw the hosts closely examining the remarkable resemblances between themselves and their family members. 'Later in life you can start to look different, but back at that certain age there's that great resemblance,' father-of-three Carson Daly noted. Scroll down for video . Like father, like son: Matt Lauer and his now-13-year-old son Jack look remarkably similar in the images, with both boys showing off the same big eyes . How things change: Matt still has the same cheeky smile, but the rest of his appearance has changed quite a bit . The generation game: Savannah Guthrie revealed an image of herself as a baby, alongside incredibly similar pictures of her newborn daughter Vale and her mother Nancy . Smile! Savannah has the same wide smile as she did when she was a baby . Inspired by The Huffington Post, which asked its readers to share comparative images of themselves and their children, the hosts kicked off with an image of Matt, 57, as a child, placed alongside a baby picture of his now-13-year-old son Jack. The group were amazed to see how similar the two looked and quickly remarked on the most obvious features. Both father and son have the same bright, big eyes and adorable pout, while even the positioning of their ears appears to be near-identical. Similarly, pictures of Savannah Guthrie at the same age as her newborn baby daughter Vale showed an uncanny resemblance between the two chubby-cheeked children. An additional image of the TV host's mother Nancy demonstrated that the family resemblance remains across three generations. Sleeping babes: The 43-year-old shared another set of pictures in which both she and Vale are just six-weeks-old . 'Get that hair!' Carson Daly shared a picture of his father, immediately prompting laughter from his co-hosts who insisted he steal his dad's slightly dated hairstyle . Family affair: Tamron Hall, 44, proved that the similarities are just as remarkable within her wider family, comparing an image of herself to pictures of her two nieces . 'This is a cheeks thing,' the 43-year-old said of the photos. 'It's a big cheeks situation.' Savannah also managed to unearth a picture of herself at just six-weeks-old, showing that even at that young age, the similarities between her and her daughter are incredibly clear to see. A picture of 60-year-old Al's son Nick, 12, was compared with a slightly grainy black and white image of his father as a child. But despite the fuzzy quality of the photo, the similarities in appearance between Al and his beloved son were clear for all to see. 'That's a handsome boy,' Al said, before Savannah added: 'That's two handsome boys.' Al's fellow host Tamron, 44, shared a beautiful picture of herself as a child, alongside two images of her Gianna and Leila. 'Handsome boys': Al Roker, now 60, and his son Nick share the same cheeky grin . 'Beautiful': Natalie Morales' co-hosts remarked how beautiful both she and her mother are . The three young girls pictured in the images could well be triplets given the remarkable similarities between them. Natalie Morales and Carson Daly opted to compare pictures of their parents with themselves as they are now, to prove that their family resemblance has managed to remain throughout their lifetimes. Carson showed a brilliant picture of his father, with his hosts remarking that the two looked 'identical', before joking that their co-host should copy his dad's slightly dated hairstyle. Meanwhile Natalie, 42, compared herself with a beautiful picture of her mother, saying: 'My mother is much younger than me in that picture.' But her co-hosts were stunned to see how similar the two looked, with Savannah noting: 'You are both so beautiful.'","Savannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Carson Daly, Natalie Morales and Tamron Hall all shared photos of themselves as youngsters ."

"A former Miami Dolphins player who fell off a fishing boat has survived after swimming nine miles to shore. Robert Konrad, who played for the NFL between 1999 and 2004, was fishing alone off the coast of Palm Beach, Florida on Wednesday night and trying to land a catch when he fell into the water. His 36-foot boat was on autopilot and drifted away from him, leaving him stranded. When he failed to return home, friends contacted authorities and the Coast Guard deployed a helicopter to search for him, but came up with nothing. Dolphin overboard: Robert Konrad, pictured in 2005, swam through the night for 12 hours after falling from his fishing boat off the coast of Palm Beach, Florida on Wednesday. He arrived on shore at 4.40am Thursday . Meanwhile, Konrad started swimming to shore through the night - spending a staggering 12 hours in the water. He eventually hit land at 1800 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach at around 4.40am on Thursday, wearing nothing but his underpants, and managed to flag down a passing cop, WPBF reported. At the time, the Coast Guard had been preparing for another search but received a call from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office to say Konrad had been found. It is believed he was in the water for between 10 and 12 hours and swam approximately nine miles, according to the Coast Guard. For comparison, marathon swims are defined as 6.2 miles. On Wednesday afternoon, shore temperatures in Palm Beach were 61F (16C) and dropped to 55F (12.8C) overnight. The former fullback told police that he had seen the lights of the Coast Guard helicopter overhead as he swam towards shore, but the crew had not spotted him, WPBF reported.

"Three decades after Back To The Future hit the big screen, a legal battle is brewing over the futuristic muscle car-turned-time machine immortalized by the cult classic starring Michael J. Fox. Maverick automaker John DeLorean's eponymous creation co-starred in the 1985 movie as it transported Marty McFly back to the 1950s to engineer his parents' meeting — and, in a 1989 sequel, to a 2015 world that featured flying skateboards, automated dog-walkers and self-drying jackets. Now, DeLorean's widow, Sally, claims in a federal lawsuit that Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company has been illegally using the DeLorean name to peddle hats, pens, notebooks, key chains and other memorabilia, and has illegally licensed the name and images to other companies including Nike, Mattel, Urban Outfitters and Apple. The company has never been formally affiliated with the one John DeLorean started. Scroll down for video . Legal tussle: Texas based company that designs and sells DeLorean-themed products is being sued by John De Lorean's widow for trademark infringement. In this 2010 photo, cast members of the Back to the Future movies appear on the NBC Today show commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise . Maverick: Engineer John Z. DeLorean created the DMC 12, referred to simply as 'the DeLorean' - a futuristic car with gull-wing doors and an unpainted stainless-steel exterior . Immortalized: DeLorean's eponymous creation co-starred in the 1985 Back To The Future movie as it transported Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, back to the 1950s . The Texas company 'has improperly and illegally appropriated for its own use Mr. DeLorean's legacy, including the DeLorean Identity, together with intellectual property,' the lawsuit alleges. The suit claims the company has plans to manufacture an electric version of the car, which it says would be illegal because the car's design belongs to John DeLorean's estate. In addition to seeking to stop the company from continuing to use the trademarks, the suit seeks damages as well as the company's profits derived from their use. Through its attorney, the company has denied all claims and asserted it has the right to the trademarks. The two sides have a settlement conference scheduled for next month. John Z. DeLorean was an automotive innovator who began his career at General Motors and is credited by some with creating America's first 'muscle' car, the Pontiac GTO, in the mid-1960s. He left GM in the early 1970s to start his own company and eventually produced the DMC 12, referred to simply as 'the DeLorean' - a sleek, angular car with gull-wing doors and an unpainted stainless-steel exterior. Part 2: In a 1989 sequel, McFly used the DeLorean to travel to a 2015 world that featured flying skateboards, automated dog-walkers and self-drying jackets . Futuristic: The DeLorean was chosen by the makers of Back To The Future because it would plausibly look like a spacecraft to people in the 1950s flashback scenes . Time machine: Interiors of the DeLorean DMC-12 from Back to the Future II is on display at  the  North American International Auto Show at Cobo Convention Center in Detroit. January 14, 2014 . Only about 9,000 of the cars were produced before DeLorean's company went bust in the early 1980s, but the car's look and cult following helped land it a role in the Back To The Future franchise. According to the Internet Movie Database, the car was chosen because it would plausibly look like a spacecraft to people in the 1950s flashback scenes. DeLorean died in New Jersey in 2005 at age 80 after years of court battles that included a highly publicized drug trial in the 1980s in which he was acquitted of conspiring to sell millions of dollars of cocaine. His former estate in the rolling hills about 40 miles west of New York City was converted into a golf course by developer Donald Trump in 2004. Sally DeLorean lives in New Jersey with her daughter. Attorney R. Scott Thompson, who represents Sally DeLorean, said John DeLorean bought his company's trademarks, images and other intellectual property during the company's bankruptcy proceeding. Hot commodity: Only about 9,000 of the DeLoreans were produced in the decade between mid-70s and 80s . DeLorean's widow, Sally, claims Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company has been illegally using the DeLorean name to sell merchandise, even though the company has never been formally affiliated with the engineer . Signature look: Profile static view of a stainless steel, silver 1981 DeLorean sports car with the gull-wing doors open, parked in front of a commercial building . DeLorean Motor Company says it existed for 10 years prior to John DeLorean's death in 2005 and has registered trademarks . The lawsuit alleges that in 2004 he gave the owners of the Texas company permission to make a small modification to the car's user manual, and they acknowledged that DeLorean owned the intellectual property. 'There is definitely no written agreement' relinquishing the trademarks, Thompson said, adding, 'to the extent that any written agreement exists, it says the opposite.' At that time, the lawsuit contends, the Texas company was a 'small forum' where DeLorean enthusiasts could buy or sell parts or exchange information. The company, disputes this characterization. William Mead, a New Jersey-based attorney representing DeLorean Motor Company, said in an email that the company existed for 10 years prior to John DeLorean's death and has registered trademarks. He said DeLorean was aware of its operations and didn't express opposition. The lawsuit claims the company has plans to manufacture an electric version of the car, which it says would be illegal because the car's design belongs to John DeLorean's estate . Failed venture: DeLorean's company went bust in the early 1980s. This file photo shows the automaker at Press Bankruptcy Conference in February 1982 in London . The Texas company has been assembling and selling DeLorean cars made from original factory parts it acquired in the original bankruptcy proceeding, Mead said. 'Now, years after Mr. DeLorean's death, Sally DeLorean has unfortunately filed a lawsuit as a representative of the Estate of John DeLorean,' Mead said. 'The DeLorean Motor Company denies that the Plaintiff has any right or authority to prevent the DeLorean Motor Company from operating its thirty-year-old business, and has no right to money damages.'","Automaker John DeLorean's widow, Sally, claims Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company has been illegally using the DeLorean name .

"A 17-year-old cancer patient has said she understands 'death is the outcome' but that it is 'my life and my body' after being told she must undergo chemotherapy treatment by a court. The court said Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was not legally mature enough to decide whether she should have the life-saving care. Doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival, but without it there was a near-certainty of death within two years. A state Supreme Court has ruled that 17-year-old cancer patient Cassandra Fortin must have chemotherapy . The teen says she understands 'death is the outcome' of refusing treatment, but that it should be her decision . Several other states recognize the 'mature minor doctrine', but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition. She will have to wait until she turns 18 in September before she can make her own medical decisions. Cassandra, who has Hodgkin's Lymphoma, is currently confined in a room at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford, where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy. This is despite the teen saying she should be able to decide whether she undergoes the treatment or not and understands that 'death is the outcome' believing in the 'quality of my life, not the quantity'. Writing for the Hartford Courant, she said: 'This experience has been a continuous nightmare. I want the right to make my medical decisions. 'It's disgusting that I'm fighting for a right that I and anyone in my situation should already have. 'This is my life and my body, not DCF's and not the state's. I am a human — I should be able to decide if I do or don't want chemotherapy. Whether I live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone's choice but mine.' She added: 'I believe there's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that I am willing to look for and explore. Not that it would cure the cancer but it may help it.' Her mother, Jackie Fortin (right), stands outside the Connecticut Supreme Court in Hartford, with Judy Stephens, 51, a Connecticut woman who said she has survived brain cancer without chemotherapy . Ms Fortin said: 'She has always - even years ago - said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body' Cassandra is currently at the Connecticut Children's Medical Centre (pictured) undergoing treatment . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever). It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. Connecticut Children's Medical Center recommended she receive chemotherapy after she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma last September. But when the adolescent refused, with her mother's support, the state's Department of Children and Families (DCF) intervened. Cassandra was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in November but was so distressed she ran away for a week. She was then taken in to custody by the DCF. She was then returned to Connecticut Children's Medical Center and ordered to start chemo. With the support of her mother, Jackie Fortin, of Windsor Locks, she refused any more when she returned. She said she wanted to seek alternative treatments that did not involve putting the 'poison' of chemotherapy in to her body. After the hospital reported Ms Fortin, the DCF took temporary custody of the teen and her mother was ordered to cooperate with medical care. Her treatment resumed on December 17, with surgery to install in her chest a port used to administer the drugs, with chemotherapy resuming the next day. Describing the treatment, Cassandra wrote in the Hartford Courant: 'After a week, they decided to force chemotherapy on me. I should have had the right to say no, but I didn't. 'I was strapped to a bed by my wrists and ankles and sedated. I woke up in the recovery room with a port surgically placed in my chest. I was outraged and felt completely violated. My phone was taken away, the hospital phone was removed from my room and even the scissors I used for art were taken. I have been locked in this hospital for a month, missing time from work, not being able to pay my bills. I couldn't celebrate Christmas and New Year's with my friends and family.' At the Supreme Court hearing, child welfare agency officials defended their treatment of Cassandra, saying they have a responsibility to protect her. 'This is a curable illness, and we will continue to ensure that Cassandra receives the treatment she needs to become a healthy and happy adult,' they said. Her mother and lawyer say they are considering their next step but expect to return to the trial court to more fully explore the mature minor argument.","Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, ordered to undergo chemotherapy .

"Rapper Kevin Gates has revealed that he found out after three months that his girlfriend was his cousin - but they continued dating for two years anyway. In a series of Instagram videos, the Louisiana rapper, 28, revealed that he was already having sex with the unidentified woman when his grandmother told him that they were related. Still, that didn't stop him. 'Everythang beautiful,' he explained. 'And yo grandmama come and tell you one day 'You know, that's your cousin.' Y'all done got the hard part out the way. Why f*** up a good thing?' Scroll down for video . No shame: Louisiana rapper Kevin Gates has posted videos on his Instagram, pictured, explaining that he was dating a girl for three months before finding out she was his cousin - but they continued to date anyway . In the video, he explained that they had a good sex life and 'clicked', so he didn't see why he should stop - or why it was anyone's else's business. Gates told TMZ Live that he started dating the woman in 2006, when he would have been 20, and that they have since broken up but remain good friends. When asked if they continued having sex after he found out they were related, he said: 'Of course!... We got the hard bit out the way I guess.' He added that he would do it again because he didn't believe he had anything to be ashamed about, explaining: 'If you doing something you're ashamed of, you ain't got no business doing it.' He never found out whether the woman was his first or second cousin, or more distantly related, but in one of his Instagram posts, he said people would tell them they looked by brother and sister. 'I got a real real big family and it's impossible for me to know every person that I'm related to in my family,' he told TMZ. 'I've never seen this person until that day.' Star: Gates, pictured performing in New York City last month, said he does not think he has anything to be ashamed of because he did not grow up with the woman - and they 'clicked' He added that he probably wouldn't have children with her, though - not because he wouldn't want to but because he's not sure he can have anymore. 'I just had two and I've been trying to go for three or four and it just ain't been working,' he said, in his clearly characteristic honesty. Gates, who is from New Orleans, shared his personal experiences with his 1.3 million followers on Instagram after he referenced the relationship in lyrics on his 'Luca Brasi 2' mixtape, he said. This is not the first controversy for the Louisiana star, who previously spent three years in prison in Louisiana for drug and firearm charges before being released in 2011. But when he got out, he learned his fan base had grown so he turned to music. 'Rap was more of a release for me, a journal,' he told Billboard in 2013. 'I didn't know I had the following I had. Once I came home from jail, that's when I saw my following and that's when I took it serious.' His first album, Stranger Than Fiction, sold 8,000 copies its first week. Last year, he released two mixtapes, By Any Means and Luca Brasi 2, which sold nearly 23,000 copies in its first week.","In Instagram videos, Gates, 28, said that he was dating the unidentified woman for three months before his grandmother told him they were related .

"An elderly shopper has died after tumbling to the bottom of an escalator at House of Fraser during a family shopping trip. The freak accident took place while the 87-year-old was on a day trip to Cardiff on Christmas Eve. The incident is believed to have occurred when another shopper tripped near the top of the escalator at the department store, knocking into another woman who was stood below. An 87-year-old shopper has died after tumbling to the bottom of an escalator at the House of Fraser department store in Cardiff, also known as Howells, on Christmas Eve . That woman then fell into the pensioner,  who was third in line on the moving stairway. All three women - believed to be known to one another - fell down the escalator at the busy city centre store and were taken to hospital. The pensioner died more than two weeks later from her injuries. Shopper Julian Rice, 48,  described how panic unfolded in the busy department store - known as Howells - but that everybody involved 'did everything possible'. He said: 'Myself and my partner happened to be the first at the scene that day and it's bothered us all over the Christmas and New Year. 'There were three women together who were on a day trip from Manchester, the poor lady that died was very badly hurt. 'I did not know her but I have to say that everybody involved that day did everything possible.' The department store's first aider Rachel Dyer, who treated the injured shopper, added: 'I can safely say it was the worst day I've ever known. Something we will never forget. The pensioner was taken to University of Wales Hospital (pictured) along with two other women. She died more than two weeks later from her injures . 'But I've never felt prouder to be a part of a team who pulled together to do everything we could. I just wish the ending had been different.'

"It is a very different vehicle from the starships he captained in Star Trek. William Shatner has revealed plans to drive across America in a unique vehicle. The 83 year-old actor, who usually drives a 2002 Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, will ride from Chicago to Los Angeles this summer on the Rivet, a custom made tricycle he helped design. Scroll down for video . The finished trike will be a two seater powered by a V8 engine, and will transport Shatner across America this summer . Shatner helped design the trike, which will go on sale later this year . Shatner says the design is inspired by an aircraft wing from the B-17 bomber. 'The finest line I can ever remember seeing was on a wing,' he said. 'Bombardier had lend me an aeroplane, and I remember the sweeping stainless steel part of the wing. 'If design can move you emotionally, that did - and I want to see that in the bike' To make the trike a reality, Shatner is working with Illinois company American Wrench, a motorcycle fabrication firm that's provided frames to Orange County Choppers among others. He has worked with the firm on the design, requesting many of the features - and rejecting a few others. 'To me, flame throwers are a little excessive,' he tells them in one meeting. The two seater trike will have a canopy to protect riders, and, crucially for shatner, will also be able to wheelie. 'This will do a wheelie in 4th gear,' he says. 'I've been across this country in sport cars, in trucks, with a dog, with a my family, and I want to do it on a motorcycle - and I'm going to do it on the rivet.' The bike is covered in rivets to keep with the aircraft wing design . Although thse mockups show a one seater, the finished trike will have two . The firm says: 'Rivet is a type of vehicle we call 'Landjet'. Designed from the ground up as a 3 wheeled vehicle, with its exposed cockpit and command centre, seating fit only for a captain and the harmonious roar of its brute V8, piloting it gives you the feeling of flying on the open road. Rivet's intent is not only to draw attention to the pilot or the vehicle itself, but to the art and craft of hand built machines, done in the spirit of keeping America's 'routes' alive. The B-17 was primarily employed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets .","Star Trek star plans to ride from Chicago to Los Angeles this summer .

"A former Florida A&M University band member was sentenced today to more than six years in prison for manslaughter and felony hazing in the death of a drum major, making him the first to receive prison time in the case. Dante Martin, 27, received 77 months, but prosecutors wanted nine years in the beating death of 26-year-old Robert Champion during a brutal hazing ritual in November 2011. Judge Renee Roche said she chose to deviate from the recommended sentencing guideline for Martin because she believed it had been demonstrated that Champion had been a 'willing participant' in the ritual. Dante Martin, left, pictured entering the courtroom for his sentencing today in Orlando, Florida . Dante Martin, center, leaves an Orange County courtroom after his sentencing today in Orlando, Florida . Champion's parents said afterward that they wanted to see a stiffer sentence to deter the hazing they called a quiet part of the FAMU's famed Marching 100 band for decades. The Champions also took issue with the contention their son consented to be hazed. 'If people are not held accountable for what they are doing, then what is the system about?' Pam Champion said. 'That's the key is sending a strong message. That's what we're missing here.' About a dozen character witnesses testified on Martin's behalf. Roche said that the testimony and other letters of support demonstrated that Martin was 'remarkable young man' and that she wanted to give him a chance to have a life after prison. 'Forgiveness doesn't have a role in the legal system. The role of the legal system is punishment,' Roche said. 'All other things are secondary.' Martin, who was shaking at times throughout the hearing, also addressed Champion's parents before the sentence was announced. He expressed remorse for his actions. Robert and Pam Champion pictured listening to Dante Martin as he addressed them in courttoday . Mattie Martin, right, mother of Dante Martin pictured meeting with Robert and Pam Champion, left,  outside the courtroom today in Florida . Robert Champion, 26, died  following a performance at the Florida Classic in November 2011 . 'This is something I will live with for the rest of my life,' Martin said. Martin was convicted in October during a trial in which prosecutors said he was the ringleader of the ritual. Defense attorney Dino Michaels said he planned to appeal the sentence. Martin was the first of 15 former band members to stand trial in the death of Champion, who was from Decatur, Georgia. The case brought into focus the culture of hazing in the band, which was suspended for more than a year while officials tried to clean up the program. Previously, former band member Jessie Baskin received 51 weeks in county jail after pleading no contest to manslaughter charges. Several others have been sentenced to combinations of community service and probation. The final three former band members charged in Champion's death have trials set for April. After the sentencing, Champion's parents briefly met outside the courtroom with members of Martin's family. Champion's father, Robert Champion, Sr., said he doesn't harbor any ill will toward any of them. 'This is a decision that (Martin) made. And sometimes you make a wrong decision, you have to pay the price for that,' he said.","Dante Martin, 27, received 77 months for the beating death of Robert Champion, 26 .

"Ed Miliband, who promised that if Labour win the election, they would freeze energy bills for 20 months . Ed Miliband plan to freeze energy prices is putting firms off cutting household bills before the election, experts say. The Big Six firms have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers as the crude oil price has plummeted, dipping below 50 dollars a barrel this week compared with 115 last June. George Osborne has warned energy firms and airlines to cut their prices. Some estimates suggest families should have seen average annual bills fall by £140 due to tumbling wholesale prices. But analysts now believe that Labour’s promise to freeze energy bills for 20 months if they win office – to fix the ‘broken energy market’ – may be keeping prices high. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said energy firms buy their supplies up to two years in advance so cannot pass on savings immediately, but the price freeze is also a big factor. He said: ‘The risk is that by the time the energy firms are able to buy cheaply, we get towards the election in May. If there’s a Labour government and they bring in the price freeze, the suppliers run the risk that they will be locked into those prices for 20 months, even if wholesale costs go up. It’s a disincentive for them to cut prices. ‘Labour’s policy has become a big factor in the price decisions energy companies are making. I’m neutral, and I don’t think freezing prices is a bad policy, but Labour shouldn’t have announced it in advance, as it allows the energy firms to game the system. ‘They are far more wary of cutting prices than they would have been, in the short-term. I can’t see the energy firms cutting prices before the election.’ A senior source at one Big Six firm said: ‘I wouldn’t completely rule out a cut in prices before the election, but the threat of the price freeze makes it a lot more difficult. ‘Household bills are not just affected by wholesale prices, but also network costs, which are rising, and government policies such as smart meters. The price freeze gives us a fourth consideration.’ Mr Miliband’s policy, announced at his party conference in 2013 was seen as a game changer for the Labour party and polls show it is backed by voters. He claimed it would save households £120 each per year on a typical dual fuel deal, and that business would be £1,800 better off. The Big Six firms have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers as the crude oil price has plummeted . Lakis Athanasiou, a utilities analyst at Agency Partners said the election and also the competition inquiry into the energy market ordered by ministers which reports later this year, are holding up price cuts. ‘The price freeze is a damp squib for gas bills, because of falling wholesale prices. If it happens – the energy companies will just make money’, he said. ‘There is leeway for energy firms to cut gas bills now, but I don’t think it will happen in 2015. But only gas – there is no leeway to electricity bills, on which energy firms are looking to make a loss this year because of the carbon taxes and green policies.’ Dougie Youngson, Oil & Gas Research Director at finnCap added: ‘In most respects, it’s a completely unworkable policy [the price freeze]’, he said. ‘It would be an unprecedented intervention by the government and it’s difficult to see how it would be implemented.’","Experts say firms aren't cutting household bills before the election .

'I begged him to leave France but he wouldn't. My companion is dead because he drew in a newspaper.'

The lawyer and former French Secretary for Youth and Community Life described to French TV station BMFTV how she got the news he was killed.'I was at a state meeting and I learned there had been a shooting,' she said. 'Then I sent him a text, a second text, third text, and then I phoned him and he wasn't answering and he never did that. 'When I got there, there were the cordons and we weren't allowed to get in and I learned there that he was dead.' Proudly, Bougrab added: 'He died standing. 'He defended secularism. He defended the spirit of Voltaire. He, in fact, was really the fruit of this ideal of the Republic that we've almost forgotten. 'He died, executed with his comrades, as he would say.' Bougrab, a member of the French National Council of State who served under Nicolas Sarkozy's administration has been described as a 'hard secularist'. The daughter of Algerian immigrants she is known as a fierce critic of religion, particularly of Islam.

Tough: The daughter of Algerian immigrants, Jeannette Bougrab (pictured) was a fierce critic of religion - particularly Islam . Hitting out at the inadequate security given to the satirical magazine and its staff, she later told TF1: 'I haven't lost Charlie Hebdo. I've lost a loved one. 'I am here, not as a former government minister, but as a woman who has lost her man, who has been murdered by barbarians. 'I admired him before I fell in love with him and I loved him because of the way he was, because he was brave. He thought that life was a small thing when he was defending his ideals. 'Do you know people capable of dying for their ideas today? No. Because they've just died, they've just been murdered. 'That's the reality, we could have avoided this massacre. We could have avoided it and we didn't.' Asked if she had been comforted by the world's adoption of the 'Je Suis Charlie' symbol and that it could be seen as a sign of victory, of hope, Bougrab said passionately: 'Absolutely not, because he's dead. It's absolutely not a victory. 'It's a defeat. It's a tragedy for our country and I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life.'

She admitted herself that she and Charb were an unlikely pairing although she'd been fascinated by him before they met. He was a communist, she a member of UMP, the centre right party. 'I have lost my love, lost a part of me. I was with a hero I admired. We tried to live normally but it was complicated.' Now she would like to see all the murdered cartoonists buried in the Parthenon where Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau lie. 'They died defending freedom of expression, secularism. They died so we can stay free in this country in France in 2015.' Miss Bougrab is one of many people trying to cope with the sudden and shocking loss of their relatives. The wife of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist, Georges Wolinski - who was among 12 people killed in the massacre in Paris - described the horror of learning about her husband's death through the news. Maryse Wolinski told RTL: 'Nobody official told me - I was quite shocked by that. Talking about my husband in the aftermath of this horrific shooting is not very easy. 'I think he died with his comrades, with his brothers, such as Cabut - in the service of his beloved freedom, for which he has always fought.' Regarding the controversial nature of their illustrations and the danger it brought, the children's author said: 'My husband was not aware of such things, he was going forward, he fought with his drawings with pencils, leaning on her drawing board.' Maryse and Georges' daughter, Esla, posted a picture of her father's office on Instagram with the caption: 'Dad is gone, Wolinski is not.' She has since told Europe1 . ""I wish that all this is only a joke."" ""He was a man who was afraid. Afraid of what society would become, afraid of the world we were going to leave to his grandchildren."" ""I thought we could stop in the street, show his disagreement, but I did not think we killed designers, "" "" I'm afraid this is the beginning of a long series , we will have to be all welded, but we are very fortunate to be as supported in the world.

"A young mother's family are standing by her boyfriend after he accidentally shot her dead while firing celebratory gunshots early on New Year's Day. In an extraordinary act of compassion, the family of Kayley Jayde Leavitt, 23, pleaded with the court in Sacramento, California on Monday to release her boyfriend, Steve Lucas, 24, from custody. Relatives wrote six letters in support of Lucas, who is facing involuntary manslaughter charges for killing his girlfriend on January 1, and he was released on his own recognizance. Leavitt's family said he is devastated by the killing. Heartbroken: Steve Lucas, left and right in his teary mugshot, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after accidentally shooting his girlfriend, Kayley Leavitt, pictured, dead on January 1 . 'They were totally in love with each other,' her mother, Nicki Leavitt, told the Sacramento Bee. 'Steve gave her more love in her life than most women will ever know.' Lucas and Leavitt, parents to a three-year-old daughter, had been celebrating the new year at their apartment complex with a friend at midnight, the couple went outside to fire some celebratory shots with a handgun. Lucas, who was a practiced target shooter, fired and fatally struck Leavitt - although how she was killed is still under investigation. Both had been drinking, according to Leavitt's mother. She said she believes her daughter grabbed Lucas as he went to fire 'to give him a hug' and walked into his gunfire. 'That's the only way I can see this happening,' she said. 'Steven does not know what happened. He just knows it happened. He had a gun and now Kayley's dead.' A neighbor called 911 after hearing the gunshots. 'We never heard any screaming, never any confrontations or anything,' Chuck Parelskin, another neighbor, told KXTV. 'They're always laughing, having a good time. I never really heard anybody yelling or arguing or anything like that.' By his side: Leavitt's family wrote letters pleading with the judge to release Lucas from custody, saying he had been devoted to his girlfriend of six years and their three-year-old daughter . Hobby: The couple, who lived together in Sacramento, both enjoyed shooting targets, relatives said . The couple had met when Leavitt, then 17, was at a friend's house and saw Lucas, then 18, drive up outside the home. 'I've got dibs on him,' she told her friend. Lucas is a house painter and tattoo artist, while Leavitt had worked at Victoria's Secret before leaving her job last year to care for her father, who passed away from cancer in May. The couple had a three-year-old daughter and were planning on getting married and having a second child, Leavitt's mother said. In their letters to the judge, the family pleaded for leniency and described the happy relationship the pair had shared and how Lucas was an amazing father to their daughter, the Bee reported. 'I am Kayley Leavitt's brother, and I feel that Steven is my family as much as she is,' wrote Matthew Keller. 'Since he came into her life, her optimism, self-security and overall happiness has increased in ways that I feared it never would. Her bright and positive energy never died down for all the years that they were together.' He explained that the little girl would never again see her mother and 'doesn't deserve to lose her father in the time she needs him the most'. Scene: The couple, who had been drinking on New Year's Eve, had gone outside their apartment in Sacramento just after midnight while their daughter and a friend stayed inside the home . Killed: Another image shows where Leavitt was shot. Her family believes her boyfriend accidentally shot her while going to hug him, and investigators agree they believe it was an accident . 'The same goes for Steven as well,' he wrote. 'He lost his beloved girlfriend; he doesn't deserve to lose his little muffin to the same tragedy.' Lucas was released from custody on his own recognizance. His bail was earlier set at $190,000. Assistant Chief Deputy District Attorney Rod Norgaard did not oppose the decision as he noted that the family unanimously asked for Lucas' release. His public defender, Diane B. Howard, called the incident 'extremely tragic'. 'Steven, as with many, many others, is grieving Kayley's loss every day and counts his blessings that he has the support of his family, her family and friends,' she said. Leavitt's mother said he never wants to drink again or look at a gun. Lucas faces a maximum of 14 years behind bars but could also be eligible for probation without prison time if the judge decides it. He is next in court on Tuesday.","Steve Lucas, 24, accidentally shot his girlfriend Kayley Leavitt, 24, when he fired celebratory shots outside their California apartment after midnight .

"Spared jail: Leoni Pryke, 24, threatened staff after they refused to allow her to take her child home because she was drunk . A mother threatened four teachers after they refused to allow her to take her five-year-old daughter home  because she was drunk on the school run, a court heard. An intoxicated Leoni Pryke, 24, then attempted to set off a fire alarm after  staff barred her from a classroom where they were protecting the child. Pryke subjected teachers to a tirade of abuse, swearing and threats for 15 minutes and staff are said to have  feared they could be attacked. They refused to release her daughter because they believed she was not fit to care for her. The 24-year-old pleaded guilty at Beverley Magistrates' Court to using threatening, abusive and insulting words or behaviour during the row last November. But she avoided jail yesterday but a judge  warned her if she did it again she would be sent to prison. Four teachers at Swinemoor Primary School in the East Yorkshire town said Leoni Pryke became aggressive after being told she was in no fit state to collect her child. The incident happened just a month after her daughter started at the school. District Judge Frederick Rutherford said: 'I'm told that she attended the school to collect her five-year-old daughter, and that she was late because she had expected someone else to be there. 'She was described as being well in drink and teaching staff were reluctant to allow the child to be placed in her care.' He said Pryke was aggressive and had tried to get into the room where teachers were looking after her daughter. She had pushed one member of staff and was abusive to others. Pryke tried to set off a fire alarm and subjected teachers to a 15-minute tirade of shouting and swearing. 'It was extremely upsetting for the staff,' said Judge Rutherford. Pryke, of  Beverley, had been warned she could face jail for her actions. However, pre-sentence reports concluded the incident was out of character. She was handed a 12-month supervision order and told she was lucky to escape jail. Judge Rutherford praised Pryke for her guilty plea and noted she had sent a letter of apology to the school. Response: Staff at Swinemoor Primary School in Beverley, East Yorkshire, kept the child in the classroom and stopped the mother from entering because she was intoxicated . Speaking directly to Pryke he said: 'Quite obviously you are utterly ashamed of your behaviour, but we have heard all the aggregating features and I can't ignore them. 'It was utterly out of character - why on earth you attended school under the influence of alcohol only you know. 'You are extremely fortunate not to be sent to prison. 'It is only because it would have a catastrophic effect on others, otherwise you would be going. 'The best way forward is to make an order. If you breach that order, you shall be going to prison.' Leon Myers, headteacher at Swinemoor Primary School said antisocial behaviour would not be tolerated in any form. He said: 'The governing body and I believe the safety and welfare of our pupils and staff at Swinemoor Primary School is paramount and antisocial behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated. 'In our school, everybody should work constantly to develop a purposeful and quality environment, well ordered for work and free from unnecessary interruption and intimidation. 'We believe this environment is necessary to create a broad and balanced curriculum.' Pryke was fined £110 and ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £60 surcharge.","Leoni Pryke, 24, tried to  set off fire alarm after staff kept child in classroom .

"These pictures show the horrendous injury suffered by a toucan after it was attacked by teenage thugs with sticks in Costa Rica. The beautifully-coloured bird had almost the entire top part of its beak smashed off before being left for dead by the cold-hearted gang. After pictures of the keel-billed toucan's injury began to circulate online - many on social media demanded the authorities to do more to track down those responsible for the attack and arrest them. Horrific injury: A toucan had almost half its beak broken off after being attacked with sticks in Costa Rica . The toucan was  taken to a local vet clinic after the attack and it is hoped that a prosthetic could be used to replace the part of the beak that was broken off. According to veterinary staff, the magnificent bird was rescued after being repeatedly hit by a group of young men - who laughed throughout the ordeal. It is currently receiving care at the Animal Rescue Centre ZooAve in the city of Alajuela, in the central Costa Rican province of the same name. Vet Silo Hurtado Pina said: 'We are exploring the possibility of giving it a prosthesis but even if that is successful it's unlikely it will ever be able to leave the sanctuary. Cruel: Witnesses said a gang of young men laughed as they hit the Keel-billed toucan with sticks . Campaign: Photos of the bird's shocking injury have promted outrage on social media with many calling on the culprits to be tracked down and arrested . 'At the moment it is having to be fed by hand and can't even drink by itself.' Many are calling on the authorities to act but a spokesman of the local Animal Protection Association, Maria Angelica Ortega, pointed out that there was no law in Costa Rica under which this kind of action can be punished. She said that first the government must make it illegal to mistreat animals. She added that they had received generous donations towards treatment of the bird and they were confident that it would be possible to provide it with a prosthesis to give it a semblance of normal life. Dependent: It is unlikely that the injured toucan will ever be allowed to leave the sanctuary where it is being cared for in Costa Rica .

"The Scout5000 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a dog's health, track their location and even allows owners to speak to their pets remotely . Doting pet owners will soon be able to get a dog's eye view of the world following the launch of a new 'smart collar' for animals. The Scout5000 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a dog's health, track their location and even allows owners to speak to their dogs remotely. The device can also stream videos showing what the dogs are up to, using a state-of-the-art built-in camera. The new gadget, created by Motorola and video streaming developer Hubble, uses 3G to send alerts to the owner's smartphone, while they are away from their pets. The downside is that the dog will need a data package for the collar to work, although it does come with ones year's 3G service as part of the £131 ($199) price tag. The collar - which the creators say is splash, chew and paw-proof - can also connect to wi-fi and Bluetooth. The company unveiled the device this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The camera built into the collar shoots in 720p HD, while there is also a loudspeaker and microphone installation to ensure the dogs can hear their owners' instructions. The device also includes GPS, meaning the canines can be tracked should they ever decide to embark on a Homeward Bound-style adventure. The firm is not new to the pet arena, with a motion sensitive webcam that enables owners to set up and remotely control the camera and track their pets when away from home. It works by recording when it senses motion, meaning owners never miss any activity while they are at work or away.

"Russia has banned transsexual and transgender people from driving as they are deemed to have 'mental disorders' which make them more likely to crash. Also on the list of those prohibited from obtaining licences are exhibitionists, fetishists and voyeurs, with the government claiming it is tightening up controls to cut the number of accidents on the roads. The shocking announcement follows international outrage at Russia's position on homosexuality and its harassment of gay-rights activists prior to the Sochi Winter Olympics. Scroll down for video . New ban: Russia has banned transsexual and transgender people from driving as they are deemed to have 'mental disorders' which make them more likely to crash. (Above, a traffic jam in central Moscow) Russian psychiatrists and human rights lawyers have condemned the move - which also puts 'pathological' gamblers and compulsive thieves on the banned list. Speaking to the BBC Russian Service, Valery Evtushenko at the Russian Psychiatric Association, voiced concern about the  restrictions. He claimed that some people would avoid seeking psychiatric help for fear of losing their licence. And Mikhail Strakhov, a Russian psychiatric expert, said the definition of 'personality disorders' was far too vague - with many disorders listed not affecting a person's ability to safely drive a car. The Association of Russian Lawyers for Human Rights labelled the new law 'discriminatory'. It said it would demand further clarity from the Russian Constitutional Court while also seeking support from international human rights groups. Strict: Also on the list of those restricted from driving are 'pathological' gamblers and compulsive thieves . But the Professional Drivers Union supported the move, with the group's chief Alexander Kotov, saying: 'We have too many deaths on the road, and I believe toughening medical requirements for applicants is fully justified.' Russia's attitude to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) citizens recently garnered fierce international criticism in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The world speculated  as to how the country's controversial 'gay propaganda' law would affect foreign athletes participating in the games and fans in attendance. International criticism: Russia's stance on its LGBT residents came under intense scrutiny last year as a result of its controversial 'gay propaganda' law. Above, Russian President Vladimir Putin . Human Rights First condemned the driving ban and put a statement on their website which read: 'Banning people from driving based on their gender identity or expression is ridiculous and just another example of the Russian regime's methodical rollback of basic human rights for its citizens. 'Beyond the denial of basic freedoms, this provision may deter transgender people from seeking mental health services for fear of receiving a diagnosis that would strip them of their right to drive, and leaves the door open for increased harassment, persecution, and discrimination of transgender people by Russian authorities. 'We urge the United States to immediately condemn this provision and to press the Russian government to repeal this decision.' The resolution, which was developed by the Russian Ministry of Health, is the first of its kind to include these 'mental disorders.'","Government says it's tightening medical controls to cut road accidents .

"The father of the man suspected of being 'Jihadi John' is accused of being one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants and is currently awaiting trial in the US for his part in the bombing of two US embassies in which 224 people died, MailOnline can reveal. On trail: Adel Abdel Bari is accused of plotting the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya . Adel Abdel Bari, 54, is now locked up in New York awaiting trial for the bombing of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania after being extradited from Britain along with hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri. Bari was allowed entry into the UK when he was granted political asylum from his native Egypt in 1993. Two years later he was sentenced to death in absentia for a 1995 plot to blow up a market in Cairo's bazaar district. In a separate Egyptian trial in 1999 he was also sentenced to life in prison. Jihadi John — who cruelly beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video released by the terror group Islamic State last week — is believed to be Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, Bari's 23-year-old son, who left the million-dollar home in Maida Vale, London, which he shared with his mother Ragaa and five sisters, to fight with the ruthless group which has run rampage through Syria and Iraq. Bari showed his barbarism when he posted a grisly picture of himself holding a severed head to his Twitter account. He captioned it 'Chillin' with my other homie, or what's left of him.' In another picture, captioned 'Fireworks', he stands in front of dozens of bags of plastic explosives. Videos posted to YouTube show Bary, who used the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny, show him praising his father in rap. 'Give me the pride and the honor like my father, I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two. 'Imagine then I was only six. Picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick. Like boom bang fine, I’m wishing you were dead. Violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.' Other lyrics express his disgust with drugs and drink. Since he went to Syria he has appealed for the videos to be taken down from YouTube as they no longer represent what he allegedly stands for. Scroll down for video .

In another video, recorded for the London-based Internet broadcaster SB.TV, he raps about the hardship of a family with 'six siblings and a mum to feed.' 'The system cut the benefits, now I'm the one for peace,' Bary adds. 'And now they want to send my family back to Egypt. 'On top of that, the pops is doing life without remand.' Bary's 54-year-old father is currently being held as federal prisoner number 67496-054 in the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. His trial is due to start in November. He was held in custody in Britain for 14 years before his extradition in October 2012. The older man has a long history of terror involvement, dating back before the birth of his son. He was imprisoned and tortured in Egypt following the murder of President Anwar Sadat in 1981, according to a sympathetic profile of his wife which appeared in the Guardian last year. After years of going in and out of prison in Egypt, during which he managed to gain a degree and become a respected human rights lawyer with ties to Amnesty International, Bari managed to leave the country and in 1991, the year Bary was born, he applied for political asylum in Britain. His family joined him after it was granted, two years later. According to the Guardian, he was arrested soon after the August 7, 1998 embassy bombings. 'There was a dawn raid by British police in white contamination suits, brandishing truncheons and breaking down the front door. Ragaa and the children were traumatized. Chief: Bari was appointed head of the London cell of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in May 1996 by Current al-Qaeda head Ayman al Zawahiri (pictured), according to his indictment . 'A dozen or so men were suddenly in their bedrooms, shouting for her husband, searching the children's clothes, tearing out pages from any books with telephone numbers. 'Adel was led away, and Ragaa, hurriedly putting on her black hijab and abaya, was told to get into a bus with her five children, one of whom was a small baby.' But British authorities found nothing to tie Bari to the embassy bombings and he was soon released. He was charged with having unlawful gas canisters but was acquitted at trial, the Guardian said. He was arrested again when the United States applied for his extradition on the same charges that the British had dismissed and he was then held in Long Lartin and Manchester prisons, at one time going on hunger strike to protest what he considered racist treatment by guards and orders that all phone calls had to be made in English not Arabic. According to his indictment in the embassy bombing case, current al-Qaeda head Ayman al Zawahiri appointed him head of the London cell of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in May 1996. The next year he leased an office in Beethoven Street, just off London's Kilburn Lane. That office became bin Laden's 'media information office,' the indictment says. Aftermath: Rescuers work to help survivors amid the devastation brought in by a bomb explosion in Al-Qaeda's first major international attack near the US embassy and a bank in Nairobi on August 7, 1998 that killed at least 60 people . Construction workers prepare to fence off damaged shops and offices at the scene of a bomb blast that killed 247 people in Nairobi lin August 1998. Adel Abdel Bari is now locked up in New York awaiting trial for the bombing, as well as of another US embassy in Tanzania . US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talks with a member of the FBI at the US embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where a bomb exploded on August 7, 1998, leaving ten people dead . It was also set up to ' to provide a cover for activity in support of al Qaeda’s “military” activities, including the recruitment of military trainees, the disbursement of funds and the procurement of necessary equipment (including satellite telephones) and necessary services. 'In addition, the London office served as a conduit for messages, including reports on military and security matters from various al Qaeda cells, including the Kenyan cell, to al Qaeda’s headquarters.' Bari 'made efforts to facilitate the delivery of fake travel documents to co-conspirators who were members or associates of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Holland and Albania,' the indictment says. He is charged with 213 counts of premeditated murder for the Nairobi bombing and 11 more for the attack in Dar es Salaam. He is also charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and several lesser charges. He faces life in prison if convicted. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan said at the time of his extradition that Bari, Abu Hamsa and a third man, Khaled al Fawwaz 'are men who were at the nerve centers of al Qaeda’s acts of terror, and they caused blood to be shed, lives to be lost, and families to be shattered. 'After years of protracted legal battles, the extradition of these three alleged terrorists to the U.S. is a watershed moment in our nation’s efforts to eradicate terrorism, and it makes good on a promise to the American people to use every available diplomatic, legal, and administrative tool to pursue and prosecute charged terrorists no matter how long it takes,' he added. The embassy bombings were what first brought Osama bin Laden to the attention of the American public. A total of 21 people, including bin Laden and Zawahiri, were named in the indictment. Of those at least nine are now dead and six are already serving life sentences after being convicted. The others are either awaiting trial or on the run.","Adel Abdel Bari is awaiting trial in New York for the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya .

Some of the survivors, who had paid $190 for a trip that included meals, a DJ, snorkelling and an open bar, spent around two hours in the water before being rescued. The cause of the accident is still being probed although it has been blamed on strong winds which made sailing conditions difficult. Authorities said the captain, 36-year-old Tenorio Gutierrez, had passed a breath test. They also confirmed they were unable to recover the remains of the catamaran from the sea bed nearly 500ft down. Firefighters' chief Hector Chaves said: 'To reach the vessel we'd need a submarine which we don't have at our disposal.' Safe: Passengers from the downed boat gather as they reach the shore. The vessel was carrying more than 100 people at the time . On land: A group of tourists walk from rescue boats before being moved by authorities to their hotels . Costa Rican Vice President Ana Helena Chacon identified the dead as a 68-year-old woman from the United States, a Canadian woman aged 70 and an 80-year-old British man. Four passengers who had been missing were found and the other 106 people on the boat, survived and were in good health, Chacon added. According to the public security ministry, 57 passengers were rescued and taken to the beach town of Herradura while 40 others went to the port town of Caldera. Survivors said they were handed lifejackets by staff shortly before the boat sank. One told the BBC: 'We were floating in the ocean. Many people were crying, screaming, asking for help,' an unidentified woman told local television. Todd Olson, a tourist from Kansas, told the station: 'The captain started to turn the wheel to the left. There were pretty heavy seas and we started to take water on, apparently on the right side. 'Within a minute it was flipped. Very fast, shocking.' Some 2.4 million foreign tourists - most of them from the US - visited the country in 2013, according to Costa Rica's Tourism Board and it is deemed as one of the safest destinations for tourists in Latin America. Concerned: Tourists stand in groups at the Coast Guard station in Caldera, Puntarenas . Transport: A man wearing his swimming trunks is led to the bus taking passengers back to their accommodation . Reaction: One of the survivors speaks to the waiting media as she prepares to board a bus to her hotel . Guiding: A woman holds another survivor's hand as she steps onto the bus. Authorities are still unsure as to what caused the deadly accident . Emergency response: Costa Rican police and paramedics await the arrival of tourists who were rescued . Support: A woman  carrying a water bottle is helped onto the waiting vehicle by police . Devastated: One of the passenger puts her head in her heads as she waits to go back to hotel . A British Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident on a boat off the coast of Costa Rica involving British nationals. 'We are in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance.' Firefighters Corps director Hector Chavez said initial reports of an explosion and fire were mistaken. Private boats in the area took in passengers until rescuers arrived. Tour operator Pura Vida Princess reported the 100ft catamaran left Marina Los Suenos. They were going on a day trip to the popular Tortuga (Turtle) Island. The public security ministry posted news of the deaths on Twitter. Vice President Ana Helena Chacon said at a news conference: 'We want to extend our condolences to the victims' families,' Ms Chacon said. According to the Pura Vida Princess website, the Tortuga Island day trip costs 125 US dollars (£83) and includes meals, a DJ, snorkelling and open bar.","Boat carrying more than 100 passengers sank off Punta Leona beach .

"A ‘last ditch’ drug for prostate cancer sufferers is to be axed from NHS use. Jevtana gives men with advanced disease at least three extra months of life – but some have survived three or more years. The Cancer Drugs Fund plans to remove the drug from its approved list effective from March because of weak cost-effectiveness. Although it will remain available for existing patients, doctors will be unable to prescribe it for hundreds of men with the disease. A 'last ditch' drug for prostate cancer sufferers is to be axed from NHS use from March this year. The chemotherapy drug Jevtana gives men with advanced disease at least three extra months of life - but some have survived for more than three years. Cancer charities say NHS England has failed patients (file photo) More than 40,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in Britain, and over 10,000 die of it. Critics say the UK still lags behind Germany, France and Italy in prescribing life-prolonging medicines to cancer patients and the situation will get worse. Jevtana is among 25 drugs being re-evaluated by the Cancer Drugs Fund, originally set up to improve access to vital medicines in England, which will issue a full list of those being de-listed next week. The decision to stop NHS use of Jevtana – it has already been rejected by the rationing body NICE – follows news that six breast cancer drugs prescribed for thousands of women are also set to be axed. Some men whose prostate cancer has spread will have no other treatment option. Dr Alison Birtle, consultant clinical oncologist at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the decision was a travesty. She said ‘As a doctor who treats men with advanced prostate cancer, I am deeply saddened and my patients will be devastated by this decision. Jevtana, also called Cabazitaxel is a drug used to treat advanced prostate cancer when the cancer can no longer be controlled by hormonal therapy. Jevtana is given to people after they've already been treated with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel. It is usually given in the chemotherapy day unit or during a short stay in hospital, by a chemotherapy nurse. Source: Macmillan . ‘In my every day experience, Jevtana has given some men with advanced prostate cancer extra time. 'Some of the men that I started to treat with Jevtana 3 to 4 years ago are still alive today – and most importantly this time has been of good quality, allowing them to carry on doing the things they enjoy despite their cancer.’ The drug costs around £22,000 for a one-off course of treatment and about 500 patients a year have got it via the CDF. The £280million a year Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) which began in April 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in England getting drugs banned on the NHS by Nice, the rationing body. The Government's aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. NHS England last year took over administration of the CDF, which is due to be wound up in 2016. Sandy Tyndale-Biscoe, of the prostate cancer patients’ charity Tackle, said ‘In recent years, earlier diagnosis and better treatments have led to great improvements in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and in survival. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Picture, are human prostate cancer cells under the microscope . ‘By removing a key treatment available for this group of patients who are resistant to hormone therapies, NHS England has failed to honour its commitment to people with cancer who have no other options.’ Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘The very fact that cancer drugs face being struck off the government’s additional funding pot in the first place is a symptom of a much deeper problem: the cancer drug appraisal and funding systems are broken.’ CDF chair Professor Peter Clark said ‘We need to get maximum value for every pound we spend through the CDF. ‘We can no longer sustain a position where we are funding drugs that don't offer sufficient clinical benefit when drugs that will do more for patients are coming on stream.’","Jetvana gives men with prostate cancer at least three months of life .

"Across the world, research has found that almost 182 million of us are addicted to using the web. And as gadgets becomes more popular, the trend is leading to the emergence of new technology-related disorders. The latest has been dubbed NetBrain - and sufferers show increased levels of narcissism, poor attention span and fear of missing out (FOMO). Psychologist Dr Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic from University College London with  VisualDNA analysed the phone and web habits of 1,000 people. They discovered a new technology related disorder dubbed NetBrain, in which sufferers show increased levels of narcissism, poor attention span and fear of missing out (FOMO) These people are also more likely to gamble online and regularly use social networks and gaming sites and apps. Unsurprisingly, people with smartphones are almost three times more likely to score highly for NetBrain than those without. The disorder was identified by researchers at London-based VisualDNA, with support from psychologist Dr Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic from University College London. Dr Graham suggests beginning with a controlled  withdrawal, which may start with a few days of complete abstinence followed by a controlled reintroduction. After the initial 72-hour detox, the treatment varies according to the severity of the case and the level of adaption. Initially, Dr Graham said people will show distress and signs of withdrawal, much like any addict would feel. 'The challenge starts when we reintroduce technology back into their lives in a controlled manner, as technology is an integral part of our everyday lives it is important that a good relationship habit is established,' he said. Establishing a maximum daily time allowance is also a good place to start, as well as strict times of abstinence. Techniques include leaving a phone off or on silent at meal times, and when with friends and family. Dr Graham continued that it is especially important for sleep hygiene that iPads and iPhones are not used before bed. This means keeping them in a different room overnight to stop both parents and children from using technology straight before, during and after sleep. A team of psychologists analysed the phone and web habits of 1,000 adults. They discovered that around 11 per cent of UK adults suffer from NetBrain: that equates to 5.7 million people. This is comparable to the number of people in Britain who are dyslexic, and approximately half the number of people in the UK thought to suffer from anxiety and depression. The study also found that those who score high for NetBrain are nearly four times more likely to exhibit anti-social behaviour, such as using a phone when with friends. And people whose personality is classed as ‘passionate’ and ‘uninhibited’ are nearly three times more likely to become addicted to technology than others. 'This research provides evidence and insight into a societal development, the effect of technology on the individual, which many people suspect to be already widespread,' the researchers told MailOnline. The biggest impact of NetBrain, however, was on work-life tension, or the amount a person’s work interferes with their family lie. When looking at the correlation between NetBrain and work-life tension, NetBrain was the most significant predictor. Those scoring high on NetBrain are almost three times more likely to score high for work-life tension. In December, a study found that smartphones have become so integral to modern life, they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain, according to new research. Around 11 per cent of UK adults suffer from NetBrain – or 5.7 million. These people are also more likely to gamble online and regularly use social networks and gaming. Unsurprisingly, people with smartphones are almost three times more likely to score highly for NetBrain than those without (pictured) The graph shows the correlation of individuals how confessed to having work-life tension and NetBrain disorder. People who scored highly for the disorder were more likely to let their work impact on their life, while people who a low score had little work-life tension . Experts found that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs. Overall global addiction: 6% . Middle East: 10.9% . North America: 8% . Asia: 7.1% . South and East Europe: 6.1% . Oceania: 4.3% . North and West Europe: 2.6 per cent. South America: 0% . They think that the more time someone spends fiddling with their smartphone, the bigger the link between brain and hand. Neuroscientist Dr Arko Ghosh, who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use, said our ‘newfound obsession’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances. And earlier this week, a separate study found that that men who regularly post selfies on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, are more likely to be narcissistic, impulsive and display other characteristics, such as a lack of empathy. Recent research said web addiction now affects 6 per cent of people - roughly 182 million - around the world. By studying previous academic papers that referenced the addiction, and comparing this to internet penetration figures for each country, data researchers also found the Middle East is the most addicted region of the world. The researchers from the University of Hong Kong began by searching online databases for previous academic papers. From this, Cecelia Cheng and Angel Yee-lam Li  chose 80 global studies, covering reports of web addiction across 31 nations in seven regions. Researchers recently online databases for previous academic papers that referenced internet addiction. From this, they chose 80 global studies, covering reports of addiction across 31 nations in seven regions. The study revealed that the prevalence of internet addiction across these 31 nations averaged at 6 per cent . The highest incidents of web addiction were found in the Middle East, at 10.9%. The lowest prevalence was reports in North and West Europe on 2.6 per cent. North America had a prevalence rate of 8%, Asia had 7.1%, this was followed by South and East Europe on 6.1%, Oceania on 4.3% and no reports in South America . As part of these past studies, a total of 544 participants were surveyed about their internet habits. There was almost a 50/50 split between the genders - 49 per cent were male - and the average age was 18.42 years. This chart shows the prevalence rate in the regions, and the number of people studied (k) This included the US, Australia, Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Iran, Isarel, Lebanon, Turkey, China, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Columbia. There was almost a 50/50 split between the genders - 49 per cent were male – and the average age was 18.42 years. This data was combined with each nation’s gross domestic product, internet penetration and reported number of web users. The study revealed that the prevalence rate of internet addiction across these 31 nations averaged at 6 per cent. If you're concerned you, or someone you know, may have an internet addiction ask yourself: . • Do you ignore and avoid other activities to spend more time using devices? • Do you think about being online when you are offline? • Do you feel criticised by others about the amount of time they spend online? • Do you feel tense or bad if you can’t get online - a feeling which noticeably goes away when you are allowed to get back online? Dr Richard Graham, who runs a technology addiction programme at London's Capio Nightingale Hospital told MailOnline: 'The internet is integral to modern life and ubiquitous, it is important that we can find the right balance between maximising the benefits of new technologies without forming an unhealthy dependence. 'When electronic devices start to have more influence over behaviour than anyone else or anything else, that is the moment when really you need to start changing things. 'When people feel an uncomfortable sense of withdrawal when they are not near devices that will allow access to the internet and when people clearly do not get the same buzz doing any other activity then we know that the relationship with technology is not being managed properly.' Capio Nightingale Hospital also offers an online test that assesses the extent of your relationship with technology addiction. Although designed for adults, parents can take this test on behalf of their children, for example, gambling, shopping social media, watching streamed or recorded videos on YouTube, and dating apps.","Psychologists analysed the phone and web habits of 1,000 people .

"The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the United States has cashed a personal check for $974.8million this week, likely ending her fight for more money. Sue Ann Arnall had appealed the ruling made last month in an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma courtroom, citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in the vast oil fortune of Harold Hamm. She slammed the court's ruling as 'inappropriate' and 'not fair', believing her ex-husband is worth an estimated $18billion. Hamm however offered to pay ex-wife Sue Ann Arnall immediately the full cash value of what he owes based on the November divorce ruling, with interest, and his lawyers are now saying that Arnall did cash the check. Scroll down for videos . Not happy: Sue Ann Arnall had filed an appeal less than a month after she was awarded $1billion in her divorce from ex-husband Harold Hamm, saying she is worth much more . Thanks: In an effort to end the divorce, Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife for $974.8 million, which she cashed this week, ending her appeal . Pay up: Mr. Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup, meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage. Her lawyers claimed he was worth about $18 billion . 'Normally when someone accepts the benefits, the appeal is dismissed,' Michael Burrage, Hamm's lawyer, told Fuel Fix. 'If she doesn’t voluntarily dismiss the appeal, we’ll ask the court to.' Hamm founded Continental Resources in 1967 and Arnall was an executive at the company. The couple were married 26 years but never signed a prenuptial agreement. Hamm had already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings. Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling. Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma. Arnall made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued. The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999. Real estate portfolio: Miss Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma . Relaxed living: The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma . All good?: Miss Arnell's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce . Miss Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her. The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Miss Arnall were married. During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division. Miss Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Mr. Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent. 'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. The Mansion: Miss Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million . Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Mr. Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion . Miss Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Mr. Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth. Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. A behemoth that Mr. Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Miss Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years. And there's somehow more. That aforementioned $9billion fortune of Mr. Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil. Started from the bottom: Mr. Hamm was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper . Working his way up:  He pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well . Filing for divorce in March 2013, Miss Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage. Mr. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream. Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Mr. Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well. And while Mr. Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years. In 2012, Mr. Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million. It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer Mr. Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Miss Arnall. Big score: In 2012, Mr. Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife . Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Mr. Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign . It was also in early 2012 that Mr. Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the Time 100 for that year. He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna. The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. Miss Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.","Sue Ann Arnall has accepted the $1billion payout she received in her divorce from her ex-husband, Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm .

"Today it is a mecca of Asian influence and American tourism - a melting pot of exotic food, lively bars and cheap jewelry and gift shops. But between 1981 and 19841, New York's Chinatown was undergoing something of a revolution, as the primarily-older, predominantly-male residents that had created the area in lower Manhattan were forced to move aside for the young families and workers that were immigrating to the United States from Mainland China.

"Cryptic tweets suggest that ISIS may have known the Charlie Hebdo offices were going to be attacked prior to Wednesday's bloody massacre in Paris which left 12 dead. The two men suspected of carrying out the mass slaughter have been linked with the Yemen-based  Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the days following the attack.

A massive manhunt is underway to catch the two suspected gunmen, who  marched through magazine building killing staff with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. The suspects have been named by French police as the brothers Cherif, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, with the men reportedly radicalised by Al Qaeda. But the ISIS fighter's tweets now raise questions about what role, if any, ISIS may have played in the massacre, with the two suspects previously linked only to Al Qaeda. Pictured is Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi (right), the two men accused of carrying out the Paris attack . A senior U.S. official said Thursday the elder Kouachi brother had traveled to Yemen, although it was unclear whether he was there to join extremist groups like AQAP. Cherif was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for his links to a network sending jihadis to fight American forces in Iraq. Both men had been flagged as a terrorist threat and placed on a U.S. no-fly list.","ISIS fighter tweeted about 'snail-eating people' a day prior to Paris attack .

"When your computer performs a spell check, opens a program or even just types a letter, it emits a tiny, imperceptible signal. At least, it was thought to be imperceptible - but researchers say a new breed of hackers could 'listen' to these signals and find out what your computer is doing. And now they are trying to devise methods to keep your computer safe from hackers employing this discreet technique. Scroll down for video . Georgia Institute of Technology researchers have revealed a new hacking method. They say hackers can 'listen in' to signals emitted by laptops and phones (stock image shown). This means, even when offline, they could find out what you are doing. It is very hard to track because the spying is 'silent' The researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are investigating where these information 'leaks' originate so they can help hardware and software designers develop strategies to plug them. Studying emissions from multiple computers, they have found a way to measure the strength of the leaks - known technically as 'side-channel signals' - and prioritise security efforts. Worryingly, the signals don't even require your computer to be online - simply being active is enough for a hacker to listen in to what you are up to. 'People are focused on security for the internet and on the wireless communication side, but we are concerned with what can be learned from your computer without it intentionally sending anything,' said Dr Alenka Zajic, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In separate research, security experts recently revealed a massive security flaw that could let hackers listen in on private calls and read text messages on mobile networks. One way in which such hackers - as well as some intelligence agencies - get access to such information is by using International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers, or 'stingrays'. These controversial tracking devices trick mobiles into connecting with them, and now developers have created an app that claims to detect such gadgets, and warn users if their data is at risk. IMSI catchers - eavesdropping devices used for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking the movement of smartphone users - are controversial because they act like ‘fake’ mobile towers. Called SnoopSnitch, the app scans for signals that indicate a switch from a legitimate tower to such fake towers, called 'stingray', where information may be being collected. 'Even if you have the internet connection disabled, you are still emanating information that somebody could use to attack your computer or smartphone.' Side-channel emissions can be measured several feet away from an operating computer using a variety of spying methods. Electromagnetic emissions can be received using antennas hidden in a briefcase, for instance. Acoustic emissions - sounds produced by electronic components such as capacitors - can be picked up by microphones hidden beneath tables. Information on power fluctuations, which can help hackers determine what the computer is doing, can be measured by fake battery chargers plugged into power outlets adjacent to a laptop's power converter. Some signals can be picked up by a simple AM/FM radio, while others require more sophisticated spectrum analysers. And computer components such as voltage regulators produce emissions that can carry signals produced elsewhere in the laptop. Because the spying is passive and emits no signals itself, users of computers and smartphones wouldn't know they're being watched. 'If somebody is putting strange objects near your computer, you certainly should beware,' said Dr Zajic. 'But from the user's perspective, there is not much they can do right now. 'Based on our research, we hope to develop something like virus scan software that will look for vulnerability in the code and tell developers what they should update to reduce this vulnerability.' According to the researchers, different tasks carried out by a laptop or smarphone produces a signal of different intensity. Pictured is a still from their video showing the signal from a laptop. They say devices will need specialist software in order to patch up the vulnerability . As a demonstration, Dr Zajic typed a simulated password on one laptop that was not connected to the internet. On the other side of a wall, a colleague using another disconnected laptop read the password as it was being typed by intercepting side-channel signals produced by the first laptop's keyboard software, which had been modified to make the characters easier to identify. 'There is nothing added in the code to raise suspicion,' said Dr Milos Prvulovic, an associate professor in the Georgia Tech School of Computer Science. 'It looks like a correct, but not terribly efficient version of normal keyboard driver software. And in several applications, such as normal spell-checking, grammar-checking and display-updating, the existing software is sufficient for a successful attack.' Currently, there has been no mention in open literature of hackers using side-channel attacks, but the researchers believe it's only a matter of time before that happens. The potential risks of side-channel emissions have been reported over the years, but not at the level of detail being studied by the Georgia Tech researchers. 'Of course, it's possible that somebody is using it right now, but they are not sharing that information,' Dr Zajic noted. The signals are produced from the hardware of the computer (shown) when it performs a task. Currently, there has been no mention in open literature of hackers using side-channel attacks, but the researchers believe it's only a matter of time before that happens . To counter the threat, the researchers are determining where the leaks originate. 'We are trying to understand why these side channels exist and what can be done to fix these leaks,' said Dr Zajic. 'We are measuring computers and smartphones to identify the parts of the devices that leak the most. That information can guide efforts to redesign them, and on an architectural level, perhaps change the instructions in the software to change the device behavior.' Each computer operation has a different potential for leaking information. The processor draws different amounts of current depending on the operation, creating fluctuations that can be measured. Saving data to memory also requires a large amount of current, creating a 'loud' operation. People in coffee shops could be at particularly risk (stock image shown), as in a public space hackers could more easily listen in to the signals from their laptop. 'If somebody is putting strange objects near your computer, you certainly should beware,' said Dr Zajic . 'When you are executing instructions in the processor, you generate a different type of waveform than if you are doing things in memory,' explained Dr Zajic. 'And there is interaction between the two.' To measure the vulnerability, Dr Zajic, Dr Prvulovic and graduate student Robert Callen developed a metric known as 'signal available to attacker' (Savat), which is a measure of the strength of the signal emitted. They measured the level of Savat for 11 different instructions executed on three different laptops, and found the largest signals when the processors accessed off-chip memory. 'It is not really possible to eliminate all side-channel signals,' said Dr Prvulovic. 'The trick is to make those signals weak, so potential attackers would have to be closer, use larger antennas and utilise time-consuming signal analyses. 'We have found that some operations are much ""louder"" than others, so quieting them would make it more difficult for attackers.' The researchers are also now studying smartphones, whose compact design and large differential between idle and in-use power may make them more vulnerable.","Georgia Institute of Technology researchers reveal new hacking method .

Star power: Chelsea was joined at the event by actress Octavia Spencer (L) and the president of Relativity Studios Tucker Tooley (R) The former NBC presenter showcased an incredibly trim and toned physique, having clearly shed any and all of the weight that she put on during her pregnancy. Wearing a bright blue dress and smart black jacket, she added a pair of thick black tights, no doubt to guard against the sub-zero New York temperatures. Chelsea appeared fresh-faced and bright-eyed as she chatted with the Black or White cast, showing no signs that she might be suffering through the sleepless nights that so many mothers seem to struggle with during the first few months of parenthood. The mother-of-one has made no secret of her interest in the film industry in the past; in April, a documentary that she executive produced was premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it received an overly positive reception from critics. In conversation: Chelsea appears to have hosted a brief chat with the cast of Black or White . Question and answer: The former NBC producer looked as though she was giving the cast members a good grilling . Proud parents: Chelsea and her husband Marc, seen here with her parents, welcomed their daughter Charlotte on September 26 . The short film, entitled Of Many, explored the relationship between the extraordinary friendship between two religious leaders - one Muslim, one Jewish.

"Time to stop remarking about how unearthly cold it is outside because on Thursday, Mars was actually warmer than many parts of the U.S. The daytime high in the red planet's Gale Crater, as recorded by NASA's curiosity Rover, was 17.6 degrees F - a whopping 11 degrees warmer than the 6-degree high in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Temperatures in fourteen states from Washington to Maine reported temperatures colder than Mars, as a brutal blast of Arctic air sweeps the country. Mars just recently passed its closest orbit to the sun, which partially explains why the temperature was relatively balmy. The Gale Crater is also located in one of the warmest parts of the planet, near the equator. Scroll down for video . It's officially colder than Mars: NASA recorded a daytime high of 17.6 F on Mars today, which was warmer than many parts of the Midwest and Northeast. Above, a postal service worker braves the cold in Rockford, Illinois where the high was 18 F . The temperature was recorded on the red planet's Gale Crater (right) which is near the equator. However, temperatures did dip to -144F overnight . However,  Americans shouldn't start planning their winter vacation to Mars just yet, as the nighttime temperatures drop drastically. Thursday night, temperatures dipped to a fatal -144 F. Temperatures are expected to improve Friday as Winter Storm Gorgon moves off the coast of the U.S. However, as much as two feet of snow will drop over the Great Lakes region as cold air creates lake effect snow in the region to create more blizzard conditions when combined with strong winds. This next wave of cold has already hit parts of the midwest, causing whiteout conditions in the Dakotas, Minnesota and Iowa on Thursday. By Friday morning its expected to pass on to the East Coast and wrap up the evening in New England. Below follows some of the damage the winter storm has done this week. The Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is surrounded by the icy waters of the Hudson River on Thursday, January 8, 2015, in Hudson, New York . Steam rises over Lake Michigan near the Chicago skyline on Thursday. Dangerously cold air has sent temperatures plummeting into the single digits around the U.S., with wind chills driving them even lower . An aerial photo shows the Navy Pier on Lake Michigan on Thursday, January 8, 2015, in Chicago . Delaying and canceling School . School districts from the South to the Northeast and Midwest delayed the start of classes or canceled school altogether. Wind-chill readings were at or below zero in such places as Alabama and North Carolina, along with a chunk of the Midwest, the Plains and the Northeast. The wind chill was minus-40 in Saranac Lake in upstate New York on Thursday morning. In northwest Georgia, schools in Catoosa County had a two-hour delayed start on Thursday because of temperatures expected to top out at 27 degrees and dip as low as minus 2 degrees with wind chills. Many other cities modified school schedules, including Detroit, where it was 3 degrees early Thursday. Students got the day off Thursday at Detroit Public Schools, the state's largest district, and at many other districts around Michigan. School districts also closed schools in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Pennsylvania and Maine. 'Heat wave'Temperatures are expected to warm up on Friday, but they will still be cold enough to produce an expected two feet of snow in the Great Lakes region . Deaths in Michigan . Authorities say the severe weather and blowing snow are factors in the deaths of two northern Michigan men — an 85-year-old who was struck by a car while crossing a road to get his mail and a 64-year-old who was hit by a car while clearing snow. A car struck 85-year-old Carl Dewey on Wednesday in Helena Township, about 30 miles northeast of Traverse City, the Antrim County sheriff's department said. There were whiteout conditions at the time, the department told The Grand Rapids Press. The Kalkaska County sheriff's department said 64-year-old Zane Chwastek of Bear Lake Township was using a snow blower in his driveway Wednesday when a car slid off the road and struck him. A pile-up in whiteout conditions . An 18-vehicle pileup that happened in whiteout conditions on a western Pennsylvania interstate left two people dead and nearly two dozen injured. Nine trucks, several of them tractor-trailers, and nine cars were involved in the crash Wednesday afternoon on Interstate 80 in Clarion Township, state police said. At least one of the trucks was carrying hazardous material, but no leaks were found. None of the injuries was thought to be life-threatening, but three of the approximately 20 people taken to the hospital appeared to have serious injuries. The others were treated for everything from bumps to broken bones. Whiteout conditions in Clarion, Pennsylvania caused a 18-car pile-up on Interstate 80. Nine trucks and nine cars were invovled . Two men were killed in the accident, both after getting out of their vehicles to aid the other injured . Dozens more were injured but none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening . Horses killed in fire . A space heater being used to thaw frozen pipes was the likely cause of a barn fire that killed more than a dozen horses in northern Ohio, fire officials said. 'It just engulfed the building. It went up in a hurry,' said Tim Kelly, an employee of the farm in Tallmadge, a suburb of Akron. 'By the time you saw it, the building was just full of smoke with flames just coming through the roof.' Firefighters were hindered by temperatures hovering around 3 degrees. 'We went in, but you couldn't see and you couldn't breathe,' Kelly told the Akron Beacon Journal. 'You could hear them, but we couldn't get them out.' A pair of onlookers take pictures as waves crash at North Avenue Beach along the Lake Michigan shore on Wednesday, January 7, 2015 . Commuter frustration . Below-freezing temperatures in the nation's capital caused headaches for commuters. In all, there were delays on five of the Metro system's six lines Thursday morning. The Washington transit agency says the system's red line was delayed in both directions because of weather-related equipment problems on train cars. The other four lines were delayed because of broken or cracked rails. Commuters vented their frustration on Twitter, with many posts including photos of stations and trains jam-packed with people. One Twitter user wrote that he loves being told to avoid lines that have delays, adding, 'OK, I'll just move my house and job for the day.' An ornamental fountain fronting the Old State Bank in Decatur, Alabama, turned into icicles on Thursday after temperatures reached a low of 7 degrees F . Keeping resident's warm . Many cities experiencing cold weather have opened warming stations for residents lacking heat. But extra care is being taken to protect the homeless. In New Jersey, some officials have empowered law enforcement to move homeless people off the streets and into shelters. Blankets were being given out at some of the 15 small tent cities around Huntsville, Alabama. Workers from a nonprofit organization there encouraged residents of the encampments to come inside. Some people planned to stay at a church that was opening as a shelter. 'We've got snow flurries as the temperatures continue to drop so they're coming in,' said Clete Wetli, executive director of First Stop Inc., which provides transportation, mental health counseling and other services to the homeless. 'The last thing we want is for someone to get hypothermia or die of frostbite.' Officials in Ohio and Georgia warned residents never to use their kitchen ovens or stoves to heat their homes.

"Surviving a day without a smartphone may strike terror into many of us who rely on our gadgets to keep in touch with friends and navigate cities. Now a survey has revealed that six out of 10 people say they could not go a day without access to the internet, while a similar number could not survive without their mobile phone. The poll was commissioned by a charity to highlight the difference between ‘essentials’ in the West and those in developing countries, where people cited electricity and irrigation systems among their necessities. A survey has revealed that six out of 10 people say they could not go a day without access to the internet, while a similar number could not survive without their mobile phone (illustrated with a stock image) More than a third of people surveyed said they need a morning coffee to get them through the day, according to the survey by fair trade organisation Traidcraft. And more than two thirds of 16-24 year olds listed their smartphone as their top necessity, as well as half of Londoners, while a quarter of men polled said they couldn’t live without their car. Half of those surveyed in Scotland chose a hot shower as their daily essential. The survey coincides with the launch of the charity’s Fair Necessities Appeal which aims to help smallholder farmers in some of the world’s poorest countries escape poverty and build better lives. More than a third of people said they need a morning coffee to get them through the day (stock image pictured left) and half of Scottish people surveyed said a hot shower (right) is their daily essential, according to the survey by fair trade organisation Traidcraft .

Despite producing 70 per cent of the world’s food, farmers who cultivate small plots of land make up half of the planet’s poorest people. Many of them struggle to afford enough food to eat, basic levels of healthcare for their families, or education for their children. The charity teaches farmers in Bangladesh, regions of India, and in East Africa more effective cultivation techniques and business skills to help grow more crops and earn more so they can afford the essentials they need.

"An incredibly rare albino dolphin was filmed near the Florida coast hunting for its dinner. The albino bottlenose, thought to be an adolescent, was seen poking its dorsal fin above the water several times in the Indian River Lagoon, by the east coast of the state. A few seconds later it exposes more of its body - and briefly crests the surface with its nose - before swimming away with a regular-colored gray bottlenose. Scroll down for video . Rare spot: The video shows the white dolphin, a bottlenose, swimming for fish off the Florida coast . Young'un: Experts say the dolphin is a a few years shy of full adulthood . Popping up: Here the dolphin's nose breaks the waters in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida . Chum: The dolphin was spotted with another, ordinary-colored bottlenose . The sighting, by a volunteer with the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, is only the fifteenth recorded sighting since records began in 1962. Some researchers believe there are only 20 albino dolphins on the planet. Danielle Carter filmed the creature swimming not far from the shore on December 10, and the footage was uploaded to YouTube by the institute just over a week later. It has reportedly been seen again in the area since. According to Live Science, the animal's behavior implies that it was hunting fish during the filming. The news site said that the Indian River waters are ideal for catching sea trout, pinfish and mullet. Up closer: This dolphin, spotted swimming off the coast of Italy in summer 2014, is another rare example of the Albino dolphin, of which there could be as few as 20 worldwide . Double act: This dolphin also swam with a non-Albino friend when it was spotted by Croatian scientists . Albinism has been observed in more than 20 speices of oceangoing mammals, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), but appears to be rare in dolphins. Animals with the genetic trait are not believed to be inherently weaker or less capable than regular dolphins, though their color can make them easier targets for predators. Dolphins with especially severe albino traits can sometimes suffer from impaired vision - though the rarity of the creatures means that extensive research is yet to be carried out, and theories often have to be extrapolated from albino humans. Although rare, the white dolphins often capture the imaginations of marine enthusiasts. Sightings of a baby albino off the Louisiana coast in 2007 caused a flurry of excitement, as did an adult albino, who was found swimming in the Mediterranean, near Italy, last summer. In the wild: This photograph, by diver and photographer Susan Renee, shows an albino off the Hawaiian coast.

"Large pieces of ice slammed down into a Chicago man's apartment and caused destruction on Tuesday, including a massive hole in his ceiling. The ice dropped into John Connors' apartment around 12pm his cat Oscar was inside, WLS reported. 'If I would have been home, I would have been killed,' Connors told the television station. Scroll down for video . Safe from harm: John Connors' cat Oscar was inside when the ice fell into his apartment on Tuesday, but was not injured during the incident . Connors' neighbor Doris Patiz heard noises, telling WLS 'I heard this terrible blast and I thought it had to be a house that had blown up with gas or something.' Connors himself told the television station of his shock when coming into his apartment. 'I walked in and it looked like a bomb had exploded up in here,' he said. He also said that he 'looked up and there was like sky, and clouds, and the planes going by and all that.' Though ice dropped into Connors' living room, another piece fell into his bedroom, which is separated by approximately 20 feet, the television station reported. Connors told The Chicago Sun-Times that on Thursday evening Oscar was 'pretty freaked out.' The newspaper reported that Oscar was not injured. Damage: A giant hole was seen in Connors' ceiling from the ice, and debris was snapped on the wooden floor of his apartment . Scare: Connors told The Chicago Sun-Tribune that on Thursday evening his cat Oscar was 'pretty freaked out' Lake View Patch reported that pal Brian McNally said a piece of ice plummeting from above called a megacryometeor could have been responsible. Meanwhile, Alder Planetarium's Mark Hammergren told the local news website 'An extraterrestrial origin has never been proven for any of these cases, ever.' Another theory floated by pilot Scott Batzel to Lake View Patch is that the ice dropped because on a plane flying overhead. Batzel told the website 'There’s a slight possibility the ice-ball fell from an airplane. It’s not a common occurrence but it does happen from time to time. It’s very likely that many arriving airplanes were operating in that vicinity Tuesday.' Batzel also said 'Some airplanes use potable water to flush the lavatory toilets. Normally the flushed waste is collected in a storage tank but if the tank was leaking, ice could have built up on the outside of the plane and eventually broke free.'","The ice dropped into John Connors' apartment around 12pm on Tuesday as his cat Oscar was inside .

"'Significant numbers' of older people could run out of money when new pensions reforms are introduced in April . 'Significant numbers' of older people could run out of money when new pensions reforms are introduced in April. In less three months' time, thousands of over-55s will be able to withdraw their pension pots for the first time under plans to allow people to use their retirement savings more like a bank account. Traditionally, retirees had to use their pension pot to buy an annuity – a guaranteed income for life. But analysis for Age UK reveals that the freedoms could leave many penniless within a decade of retiring if they are unable to budget effectively and end up blowing the lot. The charity has called on the Government to put more safeguards in place to prevent scores of older people having to fall back on to the State pension after burning through their nest egg too quickly. In its new report, entitled Dashboards and Jam Jars, it calculated that if someone withdrew £3,000 a year from the age of 65 from a £29,000 pension pot, paying three per cent in annual interest, they would run out of money by the time they were 75. Even if returns on their remaining savings were 5 per cent, withdrawing £3,000 a year would still mean they ran out of savings just a year later, at 76. Taking just £2,000 a year would still only last them until the age of 81. But with an average life expectancy for 65-year-olds of 83 for men and 85 for women, even modest annual withdrawals would leave 'a significant number of pensioners risk having to survive for several years at the end of their lives without any income from their private pensions', Age UK said. The report claimed: 'For many this will mean life will become financially much tougher with some struggling to make ends meet.' A 0.75 per cent cap on management and administration fees will be brought in from April on auto-enrolled workplace schemes, but will not apply to all pensions. The charity has now called for improved quality standards for pension firms and charge caps on income drawdown products. The report calculated that a £29,000 pension pot with a 2 per cent set-up charge and a high 2 per cent annual management fee, with £150 a year admin costs, would provide £11,000 less income than a product with a cap of 0.75 per cent. Analysis for Age UK reveals that the new freedoms could leave many penniless within a decade of retiring if they are unable to budget effectively and end up blowing the lot . Age UK called for better money management tools for older people so they avoid running out of money too quickly and quality standards on products likely to be introduced as a result of the changes. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK said: 'We welcome people having more flexibility in how to use their pension savings. 'But that makes it even more important that we fully understand the implications and consequences of our financial decisions and can trust the financial services in which we have invested. 'That's why we believe that there must be additional checks and balances introduced to the pensions legislation in addition to the impartial guidance that will be available. 'This is too important to leave to chance.' They also called for better protection against pension liberation scams, which encourage people to take their money out prematurely, incurring large fines.","Elderly could run out of money when pensions reforms introduced in April .

"Harry Pattison, pictured was given a suspended sentence after attacking double-amputee Tom Lawlor . A jilted husband was spared jail after he punched double-amputee war hero he caught in bed with his estranged wife. Florist Harry Pattison, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, snapped when he found Afghanistan veteran Tom Lawlor enjoying a one-night stand with his wife Gemma Woodcock five weeks after they split up. After sneaking into his former home by the back door, the court heard he punched Mr Lawlor in the head as the pair lay on the marital bed. Pattison was given a three month jail sentence, suspended for a year, a three month curfew, 24-month restraining order and a £1,156 legal bill. This included £85 in court costs, an £80 surcharge - as well as £691 compensation to the landlord for the criminal damage, £100 compensation to Ms Woodcock and £200 to Mr Lawlor. Scarborough Magistrates Court heard the couple had been together for five years but married only a year before Ms Woodcock threw him out. Nick Tubbs, defending, said Mrs Woodcock, who became the sole tenant of the house after the split, was now moving out. He said: 'Part of the problem with this case was although he had moved out of the marital home he has moved to the family home only a few yards down the street. 'He has enormous regret at what's happened. He has learned a very valuable lesson and is unlikely to be before you again.' Mr Lawlor was fitted with two prosthetic leg limbs after being blown up in Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device five years ago when he was a private in the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. The former infantry private, 24, met Ms Woodcock back in his home town of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, the same evening as the attack took place. The 26-year-old waitress was on a boozy night out with pals and invited Mr Lawlor back to her place. Harry Pattison jumped on war hero Tom Lawlor (pictured right) who lost both legs during his tour of Afghanistan and punched him after finding him in bed with his estranged wife, Gemma Woodcock (left) They both headed up to her loft attic room, leaving his prosthetic limbs downstairs. Prosecutor Kathryn Reeve said Pattison, 28, had also been out drinking with friends when he called his estranged wife asking to see their dog. The back door had been left unlocked and about 4.30am Pattison let himself in. Ms Woodcock heard the door go and jumped out of bed naked. Miss Reeve added: 'She came across the defendant at the bottom of the stairs. 'He was very upset she has got another male at the address only a few weeks after splitting up after a long-term relationship. Mr Lawlor was on his first tour of duty with the Green Howards in Helmand Province when an IUD exploded . 'Pattison found Mr Lawlor in bed and started punching him, as the ex-soldier yelled he had left his legs down stairs. 'He has prosthetics having lost both his legs while serving as a soldier in Afghanistan,' Miss Reeve added.'Gemma jumped on top of the defendant and tried to intervene to defend Mr Lawlor. 'She was pushed and dragged about and pushed downstairs.' After smashing the mirror in the bedroom, the disturbance continued in the downstairs where Pattison smashed up a fish tank, flooding the living room. Pattison then  ran away when Miss Woodcock called police. Mr Lawlor did not suffer any serious injuries. Pattison admitted two offences of assault by beating and one of criminal damage last month. Presiding magistrates Carl Harwood said: 'This was a serious incident of domestic violence. Mr Lawlor was clearly unable to defend himself. 'The incident occurred when you entered the victim's home address uninvited in the early hours of the morning.'","Harry Pattison, 28, punched Tom Lawlor after finding him in bedroom .

"Suspended: Alleged Oregon rapist Brandon Austin was suspended at Providence College in Rhode Island due to allegations of sexual misconduct . A woman who says she was sexually assaulted by three University of Oregon basketball players filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the school and head basketball coach Dana Altman. The suit alleges Altman knew when he recruited Brandon Austin that the player had been suspended from Providence College in Rhode Island due to allegations of sexual misconduct. It also claims that the university put off disciplinary action against the players in order to help the basketball team and that it illegally accessed her campus counseling records. The woman, who is still a University of Oregon student, alleges the school was negligent, violated her civil rights and privacy, and deprived her of her right to an education. 'UO delayed taking any action on the sexual assaults for over two months while it prioritized winning basketball games over the health, safety, and welfare of its students,' the lawsuit alleges. Interim President Scott Coltrane said the university disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit and believes it acted lawfully. He said the university is trying to improve its code of conduct and its handling of student discipline. 'It's our primary job to keep our students safe,' Coltrane said. Austin and the two other players told authorities they had consensual sex with the woman, and prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to file charges. Laura Fine Moro, a lawyer who has represented Austin, could not immediately be reached for comment. The woman met the players at a party March 8, the same night the Ducks finished the regular season. The woman's father soon called police. Suing the college: The woman suing the school, who is still a University of Oregon student, alleges the school was negligent, violated her civil rights and privacy, and deprived her of her right to an education . Negligence: The suit alleges coach Dana Altman (pictured) knew when he recruited Brandon Austin that the player had been suspended from Providence College in Rhode Island due to allegations of sexual misconduct . The university was informed of the ensuing investigation but allowed two of the players, Dominic Artis and Damyean Dotson, to compete in the NCAA tournament. Austin could not suit up because of NCAA transfer rules. All three players were later suspended from the university. Austin was accused of sexual assault and suspended from the Providence team late in 2013. The reason for his suspension was not made public, and he transferred to Oregon. Altman has said he didn't know why Austin was suspended from Providence when he recruited the player. At a news conference last year, the coach acknowledged that his questioning on the matter ""probably didn't go deep enough."" Austin was never charged with a crime in Providence. The woman, who is identified in the lawsuit as Jane Doe, is seeking reimbursement of her tuition and expenses, payment of expenses incurred as a result of the alleged assault, as well as damages for emotional pain and loss of enjoyment of life.

"The woman awoke to find Saeem Ullah (pictured) touching her bottom and 'cupping' her private parts while her husband slept next to her in bed . A shocked woman woke up in the middle of the night to find herself being fondled by a drunken intruder as her husband lay asleep next to her in bed. The couple were sleeping when Saeem Ullah, 33, from Haslingden, Lancashire, shinned up a drainpipe and sneaked into their bedroom before getting under the bed clothes. The woman, who is in her early 40s and cannot be named for legal reasons, awoke to find Ullah touching her bottom and 'cupping' her private parts and alerted her husband. Moments later Ullah was marched out of the property by the victim's angry husband - who was unaware at the time that his wife had been groped. The husband later told police that had he known the full extent of what happened the intruder 'wouldn't have got out.' Ullah, was drunk at the time of the incident and and managed to clamber into the couple's home through a bathroom window. At Burnley Crown Court, he admitted sexual assault and was jailed for two years and ordered to sign the sexual offenders register for 10 years. His counsel Robert Kearney said on the night of the offence in June last year, Ullah, who suffers from epilepsy, had been drunk and thought there was a party at the house. Mr Kearney said: 'Clearly, there was nothing going on, but foolishly, he entered the property. 'He accepts he shouldn't have gone in there. He wandered around the house for 10 minutes or so.' Mr Kearney said Ullah went into the bedroom, the husband and wife were in bed and he 'made advances,' towards the woman. He said: 'He can't really have been thinking straight about the consequences of what had gone on. 'He is sorry for what's gone on and he asks me to apologise to the court and to the complainant.' 'I can say this is an offence which is totally out of character for this defendant. This was a short-lived incident and there was no injury to the complainant. At Burnley Crown Court (pictured) Ullah admitted sexual assault and was jailed for two years . 'This is a serious offence and I don't belittle it, but sometimes women of more mature years can deal better with circumstances such as this. 'We hope this plea and sentence will go a significant way towards the victim putting this offence behind her.' Mr Kearney said Ullah came from a 'decent' family and added: ' The defendant is ashamed of what he's done and the problems he has brought upon his family and his family's name. 'When he is released he wants to put right that wrong and when he is released, he hopes to get back to gainful employment.' Passing sentence Judge Beverley Lunt said: 'It's a very bizarre set of circumstances, but extremely upsetting for this lady and indeed her partner who was also in bed. 'I can't even begin to understand what feelings she must have gone through when she woke that night to find you indecently assaulting her, with her husband next to her in bed. 'I wonder if she slept much for weeks afterwards.'","Woman woke up to find intruder in her bed touching her as husband slept .

"The son of actor Jackie Chan has been sentenced to six months in jail after pleading guilty in a Beijing court to providing a venue for drug users. Police seized more than 100 grams of marijuana during an August raid at Jaycee Chan's Beijing home. Both Chan and Taiwanese movie star Ko Kai tested positive for the drug, it was reported. His imprisonment comes amid a major crackdown on illegal drugs in China, and is particularly embarrassing for his movie star father, who in 2009 was named an anti-drug ambassador.

When I return to society, I won't do it again,' Chan said in courtroom footage aired on state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV). Last summer, police arrested more than 7,800 people in Beijing over illegal drug use. Actor Jackie Chan (left) pictured with Jaycee at the Double Trouble premiere in Beijing, in 2012 . Other celebrities, including actor Gao Hu, were also detained in what was described as the biggest crackdown in two decades.

Official News Agency Xinhua said the maximum sentence for the charge against Chan was three years in prison. The trial and sentence were especially sensitive for Jackie Chan, who was named an anti-drug ambassador in 2009, and sits on China's top national political advisory panel — the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The actor has told Xinhua that he did not use his connections to interfere with the case and that he hopes his singer-actor son will eventually become an anti-drug ambassador. CCTV had aired video of the police raid on Jaycee Chan's apartment, in which Chan was shown identifying marijuana in his possession. Ko testified on camera that he had used drugs at Chan's home. CCTV also said Chan told police that he has been using drugs for eight years. Ko, whose real name is Ko Chen-tung, has been released after a 14-day administrative detention for drug use.","Jaycee Chan, 32, sentenced to jail after police find marijuana at his home .

"Bill Cosby has staunchly refused to say a word about the dozens of rape accusations leveled against him over the past few months but on Thursday he finally broke his silence...with a joke. At a comedy show in London, Ontario, the actor alluded to the serious allegations as he saw a woman getting up from the front row and asked her where she was going. She said she was getting a drink and politely asked if he wanted her to bring anything back for him,  according to National Post reporter Richard Warnica who attended the event. He said no, that he had his own bottle of water and then said 'You have to be careful drinking around me.' Scroll down for video . Breaking his silence: Bill Cosby made a joke about the dozens of rape accusations leveled against him, during a comedy show Thursday night in London, Ontario. Pictured above at Wednesday night's comedy show in Kitchener, Ontario . The statement refers to a theme in several of his accusers' stories - that he drugged their drinks before raping them. Warnica says the crowd erupted in loud gasps, but that their shock soon turned to support as they laughed and gave a round of applause for the comment. Thursday night's show was the second in a three-stop comedy tour of Canada. Both nights have been the subject of protests outside the venues, as ticket-holders were heckled by demonstrators holding signs like 'rape is not joke'. Both of Cosby's show s in Canada have been the subject of protests this week. Above, some of the demonstrators outside of his show Thursday night . Before the show started, Warnica tweeted a photo of a piece of paper handed out to those walking into venue Budweiser Gardens. The slip of paper warns 'disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal, possible legal action and banning from the venue'. One man was kicked out of Thursday night's event for yelling 'you are a rapist'. Dale Carruthers, a journalist who tried to film the man being escorted out by security, was also kicked out. Cosby's publicist later confirmed the heckler in a statement, describing the situation as 'one outburst' in a crowd of 'loyal, patient and courageous' fans. The statement ends with Cosby saying 'I'm far from finished'. Warnica says that while the venue was not full, it was far from empty and the crowd seemed to enjoy Cosby's performance. He received a standing ovation for a second night in a row. Heckled: Canadians attending both events in Kitchener and London have been heckled by the crowds demonstrating outside the event .

"A woman and her two children have died after she jumped from the 30th floor of an apartment building while holding her daughters, aged one and two, following a row with her boyfriend. The father of the two girls, Carlos Pinto, 33, needed to be sedated after his partner Lucia Brum Padilla grabbed their two daughters and jumped off the balcony of their flat, killing herself and the girls. Mr Pinto and Ms Padilla, 20, both from Uruguay, were living in the Chilean capital Santiago. Lucia Brum Padilla  jumped to her death holding her two daughters (pictured together left) - leaving their father and her boyfriend Carlos Pinto (right) in an extreme state of shock . Neighbours reported hearing the couple shouting and screaming at each other about his friendship with another woman. They realised things had spiralled out of control when they heard screams and passers-by saw the young woman clutching her two daughters - aged one and two - as she fell. The neighbours ran into the flat where they found Mr Pinto hysterical and restrained him as he then tried to jump from the building, located in Santiago's Estacion Central neighbourhood. Neighbour Casiana Collazo Armas, who was friends with the young woman, told local TV: 'She had been depressed and was unhappy about a number of things. 'The couple had been together for years and had lived here in Chile since 2012 although they had never legally married.' Uruguayan ambassador Rodolfo Camarosano said: 'We are in permanent contact with the father of the babies, with his brother and with the woman's family in Uruguay. Mr Pinto is in a very bad state.' Police have started an investigation to find out the exact circumstances of the incident.

"A third relative has now been charged in the case of a 15-year-old mentally disabled girl who was found last month in Indiana weighing just 35lbs after enduring years of neglect and abuse. Crystal Sells, 21, was arrested Thursday night on seven counts of battery, confinement and aiding/inducing or causing the neglect of a dependent causing serious bodily injury. Investigators say Sells played a major role in the abuse targeting her special-needs niece. The arrest comes a month after Sells' father, 58-year-old Steve Sells, and his wife, 54-year-old Joetta Sells, were charged with neglect for allegedly starving the man's 15-year-old granddaughter and keeping her locked away in a filthy room for four years. Third suspect: Crystal Sells, 21, has been charged with seven counts of battery, confinement and neglect targeting her mentally-disabled 15-year-old niece living with Crystal's parents . Arrested: Joetta Sells, left, was arrested in December, just days after her husband Steve Sells, right. Authorities say they kept their 15-year-old granddaughter locked in a bedroom covered in feces . Court documents indicate that the teenager was brutally beaten by her caretakers, lodged on a blood- and -feces-stained mattress and forced to eat human waste and go to the bathroom in a bucket. According to probable cause affidavits, Crystal Sells was seen on one occasion striking her mentally disabled relative in the head with a plastic chair, WISH-TV reported. When questioned by police, Miss Sells admitted to the abuse and said that even after she had realized that what was being done to the girl was wrong, she did nothing to stop it. ‘There were clearly times over the course of the four years where she was involved in the batteries, she was involved in the criminal confinement and she clearly could have gotten help for this young girl if she chose to and did not,’ said Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings. Court documents show that Joetta and Crystal Sells waited three hours to call an ambulance after the girl was found unresponsive December 1, giving them enough time to come up with a plausible story in order to avoid prison time, according to a relative. That same relative said the women seemed more distraught by the prospect of going to jail than the girl’s appalling condition. 'Cruel': Sells was granted custody of the children in 2009 when their mother abandoned them . Together: The couple, pictured at their wedding six years ago, claimed that the girl was in the room before she was dangerous and had approached Sells with a knife. The girl is mentally disabled, police said . Steve Sells, the girl's legal guardian since 2009, was initially charged with 12 counts of neglect and battery. On Tuesday, he was hit with additional charges of theft, perjury and welfare fraud for allegedly misusing his granddaughter's Social Security benefits totaling $55,000, according to WTHR. His wife faces 11 felonies counts of neglect of a dependent, criminal confinement and battery resulting in bodily injury. The couple are being held on $100,000 bonds. Mr Sells was awarded custody of the girl after claiming that his daughter, Jannifer Sells, had abandoned her . Speaking to Fox 59 earlier this week, Miss Sells said she was shocked to discover that her father allegedly had been abusing his own granddaughter. According to the woman and her fiance, the 15-year-old has been in the hospital for more than a month now recovering from her injuries. Last month, doctors at Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital recommended taking the teenager off life support, so grave was her condition, but around New Year’s Eve she girl rallied. The 15-year-old is now said to be awake and capable of getting out of bed. Jannifer Sells and her husband-to-be Anthony Gaw said they want the girl to come live with them once she regains her health. The Sells family allegedly kept the teenager locked in a room with only a mattress, space heater, blankets, a bowl with oatmeal and a bucket, according to the documents first shared by Fox59 last month. Scene: Sells allegedly locked his granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom without enough heat. When detectives searched the house, they found a mattress, a bucket and a bowl of oatmeal in the bedroom . Authorities noted that the door had a lock at the top, out of reach of the teenager, and another child at the home said Sells would lock the door 'during the day and nights'. The child told authorities that they would sometimes see the girl's fingers reaching around the door, in an apparent attempt to get out, the documents said. Mom speaks: Jannifer Sells, the victim's biological mother said she was shocked to discover that her father allegedly had been abusing his own granddaughter . Everything inside the room was covered with feces and blood, authorities said. The gruesome conditions were unearthed after concerned relatives took the girl to hospital December 1 and doctors contacted authorities. They then executed a search warrant at the home. When the girl was taken to St. Vincent Hospital in Anderson, she was covered in feces and weighed just 35lb. She was then flown to Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in Indianapolis in critical condition. When police arrived, they said the girl was so thin that bones were protruding from her skin. 'If you see pictures of the victim, it's very disturbing,' Sgt. Joel Sandefur said told the Indy Channel. 'We wouldn't accept treatment of an animal that way, let alone a human being, a 15-year-old girl.' The teenager and a four-year-old child moved in with the couple when their mother abandoned them four years ago, according to the court documents. The older girl, whose grandfather said suffers from a chromosome problem in her brain, was kept locked up inside the room by Steve Sells, according to his wife of six years. She had not been to the doctors or to school in two years, the Indy Channel reported. He told authorities he locked her in the room to protect himself, claiming that the 35lb girl was strong and had previously approached him with a knife. The Department of Child Services asked for a court hearing regarding custody of the girl in 2011, Fox59 reported. Jannifer Sells and her fiance said they want the girl to come live with them once she feels better . 'I think they were asking for court intervention for them to be permitted to take the child out of that environment or to get services and the court did not permit that to happen at that time,' said Prosecutor Cummings - but the child ultimately stayed at the home. Neighbor Thomas McAllister told said that Sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children. He said that Sells had always given the impression he was a caring father. 'That is mind boggling,' he added. 'That is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that.'","Crystal Sells, 21, charged with seven counts of battery, confinement and neglect .

"It was a stronghold built by the Normans to help defend England from rebellious northerners and marauding Scots, but 11th century Durham Castle now faces another battle - against damp. Durham University, responsible for the upkeep of the grand monument, hopes to root out the damp in the oldest parts of the castle. The Norman Chapel, which is almost 1,000 years old, is one of the worst affected sections of the former bishop's palace and could undergo vital work to dry it out. Durham Castle is facing a battle against damp, with some of the oldest sections of the grand monument worst affected . Durham University, responsible for the castle's upkeep, hopes to carry out work to eradicate the damp . The university has submitted proposals to Durham Council and hopes to eradicate the damp by building a retaining wall. Trevar Armour, director of estates and buildings at Durham University said: 'There is currently some dampness affecting the walls of the Norman Chapel at Durham Castle. 'As part of the maintenance of this historic building, the University plans to excavate around the external wall to allow it to dry out. 'Listed building permission is sought to undertake exploratory drilling to establish the bearing capacity of the earth. 'The intention is to eventually construct a retaining wall to permanently eradicate the dampness problem.' The university has submitted proposals to Durham Council and hopes to eradicate the damp by building a retaining wall . The chapel, which dates back to 1078, is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site and houses more than 100 students . The Norman Chapel, which is almost 1,000 years old, is one of the worst affected sections of the former bishop's palace . Durham Castle was built in the 11th century by William the Conqueror to assert the Normans' power in the north of England after their conquest of Britain in 1066. In its later years the citadel became the palace of the Bishop of Durham, who was appointed by the monarch at the time, until the residence was moved to Auckland Castle. The castle's large Great Hall was built in the 14th century and was the largest in Britain until Bishop Richard Foxe shortened it more than 100 years later. In 1837, the castle, which had been converted into a college, was donated to the newly-formed University of Durham by Bishop Edward Maltby as accommodation for students. Opened in 1840, it still houses more than 100 students, most of whom stay in the keep. Since then the castle has served as an RAF post during the Second World War and is now part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. Details of the plans submitted to Durham County Council reveal the university will drill five exploratory boreholes at the site in an attempt to alleviate the damp. Experts have described the works as 'essential' to prevent further deterioration of the site which served as a command and observation post for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. A report, included in the planning application, said: 'The works to the Norman Chapel are essential to reduce the rate of decay of stonework within the chapel.' The chapel, which dates back to 1078, is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Grade I listed building is also home to 100 students. The application seeks to safeguard the chapel, which is still used for occasional worship, adding: 'The proposal is to carry out a site investigation on the North Terrace of Durham Castle to provide geo-technical data for the design of a retaining wall adjacent to the Norman Chapel, which will expose the buried wall of the chapel and allow it dry out.' Proposals submitted to planners said there will be no major visual impact and Durham University was unable to say if the work would affect use of the chapel, though the public can only access the castle on guided tours. A decision is expected later in the year.","Durham Castle, built in the 11th century, is facing a serious damp problem .

"Nasa has teamed up with car manufacturer Nissan to develop new self-driving cars that could be used to race across the surface of Mars. The technology created during the five-year partnership will also be adapted to create better driverless vehicles that can be used on roads on Earth. Robotics experts from the space agency will work with engineers from Nissan to adapt the company's electric Leaf cars. Scroll down for video . Future rovers on Mars could look more like Nissan's Leaf electric cars as the automobile manufacturer is to develop technology jointly with Nasa to create self-driving vehicles that could be used on Earth and in space . Nissan has pledged to have autonomous cars on the market by 2020, but the technology currently faces significant challenges to cope with the dangers of public roads. However, Nasa believes sensors and systems being developed to help driverless cars deal with pedestrians, cyclists, overtaking vehicles and parked cars, could also help to develop new robotic rovers for use in exploring other planets. Nasa is hoping to send the next generation of rover to continue exploring the Red Planet in 2020. With upgraded hardware and instruments, it will examine the Martian rocks and assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of Martian life. It will identify and collect rock and soil samples, which it will eventually be able to send back to Earth intact with the help of another future spacecraft that will land on the surface and pick them up. Dr Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to Earth is Nasa's top priority. Scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to Mars and the future colonisation of the planet. The rover marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. In an attempt to speed up the next rover, the European Space Agency . Currently rovers like Nasa's Curiosity move at an achingly slow pace over the surface of Mars - it has a top speed of 0.08mph (0.13km/h). This is slow progress is necessary to allow the rover's computers time to detect and manouvour around obstacles like rocks and deep sandpits that might bog it down. Such limitations have meant that missions to the Red Planet have explored just a tiny fraction of its surface. The Mars Rover Opportunity has traveled just 25 miles in more than 10 years on the planet. By adapting technology to be used on Earth's roads, it could allow rovers to travel at far greater speeds and explore much more of the surface. This could prove crucial in scouting out potential sites for future manned missions to the Martian surface. Dr Pete Worden, director of Nasa Ames Research Centre in California, told Wired: 'The more we look at it, the more there are a lot of similarities there. 'We have a rover on Mars - it is not very autonomous. As we go deeper into space, into more and more dangerous locations, we need to add that autonomy.' It is not the first project that Nasa and Nissan have collaborated on. In 2005 the two organisations teamed up to develop more comfortable and safer car seats. Nissan drew upon data from Nasa's Human Research Program at its Johnson Space Centre that had used experiments from space to examine the neutral body position of astronauts while they were sitting in low gravity. Nissan used this to build seats for its cars that would lower the amount of fatigue drivers would feel and reduce pressure spots. Previous rovers have spent years exploring less than 100 miles of the vast surface of Mars (above) Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn, picutred above on the left, and Nasa Ames Research Centre director Pete Wordon, on the right, have agreed to collaborate on technology for use in autonomous vehicles and rovers . The Martian surface, seen here in this 'selfie' by Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity, is littered with rocks, deep sand and other obstacles that pose a threat to vehicles but technology developed for cars on Earth could help . Among the first steps in the new collaboration will be to map the roads around Nasa Ames Research Centre in California so that Nissan can test drive adapted autonomous versions of its Leaf electric vehicles (above) Dr Maarten Sierhuis, director of Nissan's Silicon Valley Research Centre, who spent 12 years working as a senior scientist at Nasa Ames Research Centre, is thought to be the architect behind the latest collaboration. He told Wired: 'This is a perfect blend of the capability of what the robotics folks at NASA Ames have and the autonomy that we bring.' In the latest project engineers will begin by conducting online simulations before hoping to get an actual car on the road by the end of 2015. Nasa's track record in building spacecraft and rovers that are reliable and have significant degrees of latent safety will be invaluable to building autonomous cars for use on Earth. Nasa's Curiosity Rover, seen above in an artists impression, has a top speed of just 0.08mph as it needs to avoid obstacles but it is hoped that future rovers will be able to negotiate the Martian surface at higher speeds . There are some who fear that software glitches and mechanical faults in autonomous vehicles that share the road with human drivers could turn them into death traps. However, Dr Worden added: 'All of our potential topics of research collaboration with Nissan are areas in which Ames has strongly contributed to major NASA programs. 'Ames developed Mars rover planning software, robots onboard the International Space Station and Next Generation air traffic management systems to name a few. 'We look forward to applying knowledge developed during this partnership toward future space and aeronautics endeavors.' Carlos Ghosn, president and CEO of Nissan, added: 'The work of NASA and Nissan – with one directed to space and the other directed to earth, is connected by similar challenges. 'The partnership will accelerate Nissan's development of safe, secure and reliable autonomous drive technology that we will progressively introduce to consumers beginning in 2016 up to 2020.' Some experts have raised concerns about how humans themselves will respond when sharing the road with autonomous vehicles. A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars. Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly. Now Google has realised that if it wants its driverless cars to be able to compete with pushy human drivers on the open road, they too need to be more assertive. After testing its autonomous vehicles over 700,000 miles of public road, Google's engineers have tweaked the software that controls the cars to give them a slightly more aggressive edge.","Engineers at Nasa and Nissan will work on  new technology for robotic cars .

"He's the playboy son of the late footballing legend George Best and has battled with drug and alcohol addiction in the past. But as a suited and booted Calum Best entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on Wednesday night the 33-year-old looked better than ever. But his current dapper image is the result of a new clean-living lifestyle, serious gym time and three hair transplants - now fans wonder if he'll find love on the reality show. Scroll down for video . Calum was back to looking his best last night as he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, the TV personality has reinvented himself over the last few years with a new sleek look . Calum has had an image overhaul in the last few years, he's ditched his tacky ripped jeans and  hit the gym . His new sleek look is a far cry from his outfits and hair styles when he first arrived in the UK in 2002 after growing up with mother Angie Best in California. Despite being a model for River Island his personal style left a lot to be desired. There were the long-haired years when Calum channeled baggy jeans and vests seemingly in homage to American rap stars. Then came the era when he when he rocked oversized polo shirts, low-slung trousers and bright white tennis shoes. In fact it wasn't really until recently that Calum started to develop any fashion finesse. Last year he attempted the hipster look growing an impressively large bushy beard. However, he ended up shaving it off after it began to take too long to groom. Trendy: In recent years Calum has moved away from his bad boy image - embraced trendy East London style . In his younger years a curly haired Calum, a dead ringer for dad George Best, was a model for River Island . Calum wears a T-shirt declaring 'Brits do it Best ' for a campaign for River Island . He said: 'It turns into a daily grind making sure it is ship shape. It needs a lot more maintenance than your head hair and you have the added complication of keeping it clean. I feel ten years younger without it.' However that wasn't before his facial fuzz helped him land a  cool advertising deal as the star of a Rolls Royce campaign in Dubai in March 2014. Of course, his new look hasn't come easy. In fact to get his hair so sleek Calum has undergone not one, but three hair transplants after suffering from a receding hairline. Calum also works hard on his body having previously undergone a ten day bootcamp in Ibiza to get tone himself up. In 2003 a young Calum was spotted rocking a long pony tale and some rather questionable vests . Calum's partying ways got him into trouble and in 2007 he declared himself bankrupt . A jaded-looking Calum wore an ill-fitting suit to the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards in 2006 . A friend of Calum's said that he's even started his own line of supplements: 'Since changing his partying lifestyle, Calum has put everything into his health and fitness. 'He is at the gym every day and actually personally trains people there as well. He eats very healthily and clean. 'He co-founded a brand of protein supplements called BestLife which he is passionate about. Since he embarked on this fitness mission he is so happy mind, body and soul with the results and the reaction from other people has been very rewarding.' And he even hopes he can keep his figure in shape in the Big Brother house: 'Calum hopes that he can maintain this in the CBB house. As the house doesn't have a gym he sought out advice from his personal trainer, Scott Alexander - who is working with Tom Cruise for Mission Impossible 4 - and has helped him come up with some exercises. Before the dapper look he is rocking now Calum went for a bearded hipster vibe . Being on the high-profile programme is a way for Calum to show how much he has matured since his days as a regular on the London's party circuit. He is the son of George Best, who became more famous for his addiction to alcohol than his genius on the pitch towards the end of his life in 2005. George's issues would haunt Calum who described how he would feel, 'demonic anger,' because of his father's drinking. Indeed in 2007 his own life started to fall apart as he spiraled out of control, suffering alcohol and drug addiction. Calum said at the time: 'I’m a bad boy. I go out and get drunk, I get high on cocaine and I do stupid debauched things with the wrong women. Calum had a string of high-profile love interests such as Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding in 2005 . Calum and Elizabeth Jagger starred in a Monsoon advert together and have been romantically linked . 'I’ve been sowing my oats for years, and I’ve been doing drugs for the past six years. I do drink too much and it gets out of control. 'The drink leads to the coke and the coke leads to debauchery - the wrong people and places. When I’m high I do wild, stupid s**t. I’m a red-blooded male and I’m addicted to sex. 'I don’t have to be like Dad, but I feel his blood running through my veins. I need to sort out my problems before it’s too late.' And sow his oats he did. Calum enjoyed a number of high-profile relationships and dated Lindsay Lohan, Kimberley Stewart and was romantically linked to Elizabeth Jagger and Rachel Hunter. Calum first met Lindsay in London in 2006 when she was in town to host the World Music Awards. Up-front: Despite being in the house for less than twenty-four hours, Perez was quick to ask Calum about his relationship with the much-maligned actress - specifically, if they're still in touch . Calum works out regularly and posts pictures of himself in the gym, showing off his tattooed biceps . Shortly after they separated, Best opened up about how he really felt about their break-up, saying: ‘She’s a lovely girl and to be honest I don’t know why we ended on such bad terms. 'I have nothing but good things to say about her but for some reason she doesn’t like me.’ Admitting their affair was great fun, when asked if he would like to see Lindsay again while she's in the UK, he said: ‘No, we will definitely not be rekindling what we once had.’ Yet despite appearing on a number of television shows such as Celebrity Love Island and having his own show named Totally Calum Best he struggled to keep himself afloat. In 2013 he declared himself bankrupt. He said at the time: 'I can confirm I have made the decision to declare myself bankrupt as a result of being unable to make tax repayments.' 'I was blessed to earn a large amount of money at a young age, and mistakes have come with that. But also lessons learned.' It was then that Calum decided to turn over a new leaf and has since been working on becoming a new man. He's already declared his desire to find love in the Big Brother house, it remains to be seen whether he'll gain a new generation of female fans on the Channel 5 show. Calum has admitted that  he has never been love but he has had no shortage of lovers. Calum previously dated trouble star Lindsay Lohan . It has widely been suggested that Calum will be the first to hook up with one of his Celebrity Big Brother castmates.

"A Toronto illustrator has launched a Twitter campaign that he hopes will draw more attention to the rising number of missing and murdered native Canadian women across the country. Evan Munday, who writes and illustrates picture books, is drawing black-and-white cartoons of  the over 1,186 missing indigenous women and then tweeting one sketch to Canada's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, each day. He launched the campaign on Monday as a reaction to recent comments Harper made about the number of missing and murdered women in the country, to which Harper responded: 'It isn't really high on our radar, to be honest.' 'Just hearing him say that, it was just such a glib non-answer that it was the catalyst for me doing this,' Munday told CBC News. Campaigner: Illustrator Evan Munday (left) will tweet a drawing of one missing or murdered inidigenous Canadian woman each day in the hopes of forcing Prime Minister Stephen Harper to act on the issue . Not on his radar: Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently said a public inquiry into the amount of native women to go missing or be murdered 'isn't really high on our radar' Munday hopes his drawings might help bring about a formal inquiry into the matter through the power of Twitter. 'I hope it's not viewed as offensive,' Munday added to the network. 'Part of it is trying to do a tribute and thinking about them and their lives as I do the drawing.' The figure of missing women is from the last 30 years. Munday is sourcing pictures of the women online and then sketching them in blank ink. Munday hopes enough people will get behind his campaign that it will 'change the radar' of the PM and how he feels about the issue. He is the illustrator of the novel Stripmalling, and the author and illustrator of the graphic novel series Quarter-Life Crisis. Munday is perhaps best known though for the The Dead Kid Detective Agency series. He hit headlines in a similar capacity in December during the anniversary of the École Polytechnique de Montréal massacre. The mass shooting at the university on on December 6, 1989, and of the 28 people shot, 14 were killed. Munday did portraits of each of the victims in the same style as his missing persons ones and put them on Twitter. He told BuzzFeed News that after that the made made him 'think about how violence against women is still happening all the time in Canada, and it effects women of indigenous background disproportionately'. He also realized that 'many indigenous women’s organizations and activist groups and families of the missing women have called for a public inquiry into this epidemic, and how those calls have fallen on mostly deaf ears'. The comments made by Harper that affected Munday were said during the Prime Minister's end-of-year interview with the CBC. Harper was asked whether he planned to initiate a formal inquiry into the whereabouts of missing indigenous women, because calls for such had been rejected in the past. 'It isn’t really high on our radar, to be honest,' Harper said. 'Ministers will continue to dialogue with those who are concerned about it.' Munday told BuzzFeed that, so long as he can source photos of the missing women, he hopes to draw them all, and doesn't care if it takes years.","Toronto based illustrator and author Evan Munday is sketching cartoons of missing or murder indigenous Canadian by finding photos online .

"The mother of a boy who was seen banging his head against a window for days at his North Brisbane home has been charged with child cruelty. Speaking at the Brisbane Magistrates Court today, crown prosecutor Gretchen McKinley said the two boys who were living in complete squalor were both  autistic and would suffer emotional and psychological scars as a result of their abuse. The boys were found naked in the filthy house in Keperra on a cold May morning. The smell of urine and faeces made the police officers physically gag as they rescued the boys. The mother of a boy who was seen banging his head against a window at his North Brisbane home has been charged with child cruelty . A neighbour saw the two-year-old boy 'screaming, crying and headbutting' the window for up to two days at his home from May 3 to May 4. Ms McKinley said the two-year-old boy was autistic while his older brother, who was aged four at the time of the abuse, may also be autistic. The court heard evidence from the two-year-old boy's foster mother and sister, who claim the little boy is often seen curled up in the foetal position  and is easily frightened. There was previous evidence of neglect at the house that was known to the Department of Child Safety but the woman was only standing trial for the abuse in early May. The boys were found naked in the filthy house in Keperra on a cold May morning. The smell of urine and faeces made the police officers physically gag as they rescued the boys . While the mother's layer Lewis Shillito admitted that there was evidence of a 'lack of care' in the house, it was not possible to determine whether the boys would suffer mentally because of the abuse. However, judge Judith Daley said it would be the jury's decision what harm the neglect has had on the two boys. A date for the woman's trial has not yet been set.

"The United States has issued a global travel warning after recent terror attacks in France, Australia and Canada. The alert by the U.S. Department of State comes hours after French police killed three hostage-takers in a pair of incidents. Two of the men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, are believed to be responsible for Wednesday's attack on a satirical magazine in Paris, Charlie Hebdo. Scroll down for video .

Twelve people were killed in that assault, France's deadliest terror incident in decades. The Yemen branch of al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attack . The State Department's warning says attacks against Americans are becoming increasingly prevalent. 'Recent terrorist attacks, whether by those affiliated with terrorist entities, copycats, or individual perpetrators, serve as a reminder that U.S. citizens need to maintain a high level of vigilance,' the Department said Friday.

"Danielle Watson claimed she had late-stage cervical cancer so friends and kindhearted strangers would pay for her wedding - but she was not sick . A young mother who defrauded friends and kindhearted strangers out of thousands of pounds to pay for her dream wedding by claiming she had terminal cancer will not be jailed. Mother-of-two Danielle Watson, 24, claimed she had late-stage cervical cancer to get her hands on donations, freebies and cut-price deals for her wedding worth almost £10,000 - even conning her husband into believing she was dying. There was fury outside Basildon Crown Court today after a judge ruled she should not be jailed for the fraud. Watson, of Rowhedge, Colchester, fooled dozens of people by giving regular updates on how her condition was progressing, a court heard today. The then 21-year-old admin assistant even brought forward her wedding by several months to April 2012 so she could walk up the aisle before radiotherapy and chemotherapy were 'due' to make her hair fall out. In reality she had only had minor surgery for a treatable gynaecological condition and had never been diagnosed with, or treated for, cancer. Well-wishers had raised more than £6,000 for a specialist Vitamin C cancer treatment only available in America for Watson through fundraising events. Business owners also helped organise her dream wedding to husband Chris Watson in April 2012. Watson, who claimed she had the same condition as Jade Goody, was gifted a lavish £3,500 wedding package at the Ivory Rooms - a sophisticated bar and restaurant in Billericay, Essex - involving a three-course wedding breakfast, evening buffet and DJ. Other freebies included a £700 rented wedding dress which was never returned, wedding planning services priced at £1,100, hair styling and 10 bottles of champagne. Watson admitted six counts of fraud by false representation and sobbed in the dock as Recorder Gerard Pounder sentenced her to 12 months in prison suspended for two years. She must also carry out 200 hours of unpaid work in the community. He said: 'You showed a supreme lack of maturity in the way in which you conducted your life. 'It is a great testament to the many people who dealt with you with supreme generosity because they believed you only had a short time left on this planet.' Watson, who even convinced her husband Chris Watson that she had cancer, raised £10,000 in cash and freebies . Despite her fraud, Watson was not jailed and was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years . He did not order her to pay prosecution costs so she can use the money to repay her victims. One of the victims, Victoria Oliver, who raised about £2,000 for Watson after hearing her sob story through a friend - said she was stunned at today's sentence. She said: 'I think it is an absolute travesty she hasn't been made an example of. She conned hundreds of people. 'It is disgusting that she has shown absolutely no remorse and is now effectively walking away scot free.' Watson, pictured outside court today with her baby, intends to pay the money back to her victims . The personal banker from Billericay added: 'By the time we knew what she had done there was no money in the account. She had spent it all. 'This has had a bid effect on me. I raised a lot of money in a short space of time. 'I've now lost confidence in doing something like that again. I just hope he genuine people don't lose out on donations because of her lies.' Paul Hatton, 43, general manager at The Ivory Rooms, where her wedding was held, said: 'When Danielle came to me and said she had the same disease as Jade Goody and cried it really pulled at my heart strings. 'We all just wanted to help her. 'Her wedding day was great as everyone in Billericay pulled together to make sure it was a memorable day. That memory is now very tainted. 'It's not about the money - it's about the loss of trust. That is what is so hard to forgive. 'She has also taken money that could have been used for someone who needed it and deserved it.' Watson admitted six counts of fraud by false representation and sobbed in the dock as Recorder Gerard Pounder sentenced her . Watson brought her six-week old son to court with her and wrote a personal letter to the judge expressing her remorse. Rebecca Blain, mitigating, said Watson had only confirmed to her friends and family that she had told a lie on the day she pleaded guilty last October. She added: 'The genesis of these lies was opportunistic. She did this on a whim and did not think through the wider impact of those lies.' Watson has access to a 'substantial lump sum' and hopes to pay £800 a month back to her victims, Ms Blain added. Fundraisers who helped expose the con have managed to recover some of the funds and last year donated £6,563 to the Mercedes Curnow foundation - a genuine charitable cause dedicated to the early detection of cervical cancer.","Danielle Watson convinced her friends she had terminal cervical cancer .

An image has been released of Christopher Chandler, who police allege was driving the stolen charcoal-coloured Audi A4 sedan when it crashed through a fence and into a backyard in Constitution Hill near Paramatta. The wanted man, described as being in his mid to late 20s, remains on the run this afternoon but is apparently well known to police, who want to question him in relation a spate of armed robberies in the local area in the past month. Scroll down for video . An image has been released of Christopher Chandler, who police allege was driving the stolen charcoal-coloured Audi A4 sedan when it crashed through a fence and into a backyard in Constitution Hill near Paramatta . Police say they are appealing for the public's assistance in finding Chandler, who is described as being of Caucasian appearance, fair complexion, with short brown hair, facial hair, about 175-185cm tall, green/hazel-coloured eyes and of a thin build. Between 10.30am and midday on Wednesday, the car was stolen from Anzac Parade at Kingsford. The vehicle was recovered shortly after 7.30pm yesterday  on Bourke Street, near the intersection of Forbes Street, at Darlinghurst. If anyone spots Chandler, police urge them not to approach him, but to call Triple Zero immediately. Tatiana Tauaifaga, 17 months, was tragically killed when an allegedly stolen car attempted to elude police . Family members have described 17-month-old Tatiana 'Talia' Tauaifaga who was tragically killed by the stolen car as a 'very bright' and 'happy' child. The toddler was playing near her home with two sisters, aged five and six, when the car mowed down her fence while attempting to elude police. Tatiana, reportedly a twin, sustained fatal injuries after being hit in the chase involving an allegedly stolen Audi and five police vehicles  in Constitution Hill near Parramatta. Her distraught uncle Tulaga Toleafoa described her as ‘very bright, would always be playing around the back on the castle’, a very happy young girl, very healthy’.

A 22-year-old woman, reportedly a passenger in the Audi, was arrested in Darlinghurst in inner-city Sydney and will appear in court on Friday . Mr Toleafoa said the family is still in a state of shock. ‘I couldn’t believe it. I thought she’d make it. But they were driving too fast,’ he said. ‘She was a very happy girl, liked to talk a lot, talk to people ... a very happy little baby and our family misses her very much, we don’t know what to do, it’s very sad. ‘We are a very close family. ‘We don’t know who to blame really, the police were just trying to do their job, we don’t really know how they handled it, we are just trying to get over it and take it from here.’ Tatiana's mother Helena Tauaifaga is a single mother of nine, who is thought to have been a contestant on the X Factor program. Neighbour Raymond Nair witnessed the car chase. He is pictured leaving flowers at the scene . Tatiana's uncle Mr Toleafoa (right) embraces neighbour Mr Nair on Friday . Children from the neighbourhood laid flowers outside the family home on Friday . Mr Nair (in yellow) is seen at the scene of the crime in Western Sydney with police on Friday . Another family member Joseph Tauaifaga posted about his anguish on Facebook while at hospital on Thursday night. 'Wen i find u im gna kill ur whole family muthaf***er ! — feeling annoyed at The Children's Hospital at Westmead,' he wrote. Tatiana's siblings suffered only minor injuries, and were treated for scratches and bruises. Police had followed the car into Bessbrook Way, a cul-de-sac, when the driver ran down a garden fence and drove into a backyard near where the children were playing about 7pm last night. The Audi was being chased by five police cars, but police have yet to forensically confirm which vehicle struck the child. Neighbour Raymond Nair is adamant the impact occurred on the street, not in the backyard. Mr Nair, who lives two doors up from the family home, watched on in shock and told of how he saw members of the family run out of the home, crying out loud. ‘The kids ran inside and called the mum and they ran outside and saw her there,' he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I came out and saw the Audi and then the undercover cop car with the siren on and four other police cars behind them.’ An emotional police officer on the scene at Bessbrook Way in Constitution Hill near Parramatta . A child's toy is teen lying on the grass near a fence which was mowed down by an allegedly stolen Audi . Mr Nair said the Audi went through the small and usually quiet culdesac at Bessbrook Way at high speed of about 100km/h. ‘The Audi went straight through the fence and then the backyard and the fence into the park and the kids were playing out the front, on their bicycles you know,' he said. ‘Then I heard the bang and I went and saw the little kid on the floor and bleeding and everything and then I went and asked if I could help but the police said ""no, it’s a crime scene"" so they I did what they told me and backed off.’ ‘Then I was standing there for a while and I was in shock with the little girl just there. ‘I couldn’t believe what I saw in this street. Why a chase like this in this street?’ Kristina, 13, was among a group of a dozen local children playing cricket with other members of the Tauaifaga family in the park, which borders the housing commission estate, just moments earlier. She was one of several locals who visited the scene of the accident on Friday afternoon - as a small makeshift shrine of flowers and cards began to take shape. 'We had just finished playing and stopped to sit on the wall for a few minutes,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then all of a sudden there's all crashing and banging and we look up the hill and there's cars smashing through the fence right into the park and they're chasing the Audi down the hill. 'Then we see another car come into the park from behind us. 'One of her brothers started running up to the house and that's when we heard what happened.' Police had followed the car into Bessbrook Way, a cul-de-sac, when the driver ran down a garden fence . Police have established a critical incident investigation to look at all circumstances surrounding the incident, including the pursuit. The investigation will be overseen by the Professional Standards Command. A 22-year-old woman, reportedly a passenger in the Audi, was arrested in Darlinghurst in inner-city Sydney and will appear in court on Friday. Police arrested the woman on Clapton Place and will allege she was searched and found in possession of prohibited drugs. She was taken to Kings Cross Police Station and charged with supplying a prohibited drug and two counts of possessing a prohibited drug. Police also executed six outstanding warrants for offences including; armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, affray, stealing, possessing housebreaking implements, possessing a prescribed restricted substance, using a false document to influence exercise of public duty, and two counts of goods in custody. On Thursday evening, the Audi smashed through the Bessbrook Way fence before driving through another fence on the property and into nearby Richill Park. Another group of children playing cricket were forced to drop their bats and run to get out of the vehicle's dangerous path. The toddler sustained fatal injuries in the chase involving an allegedly stolen car and multiple police vehicles . Reports have emerged that up to seven other children of Samoan background - including the 17-month-old's twin - were playing in the backyard when the car drove through . Witness Carol Davis said she screamed at the children to run for their lives as the car came tearing through the park. 'I ran up to the house and I see the mother holding her newborn baby, she was screaming,' Ms Davis told the Daily Telegraph. 'I could hear the kids in the house just going ballistic, they were petrified.' Rose, 14, is a friend of the Tauaifaga children and was visibly upset when she recounted the incidents of Thursday night. ‘I was outside when it happened, I heard this bang and then everything went slow and then fast again and everything broke, the whole fence and then I saw one Audi car and two four-wheel-drives chasing it,’ she said. ‘Then the first car hit a trolley and the others kept following it. I got scared and then ran inside. ‘Then I looked from inside and saw the mum holding the baby, calling out “someone call an ambulance”. ‘I sat outside for a bit. I’m feeling very upset, we used to play together.’ A neighbour said the Audi came through the normally quiet and small Bessbrook Way at high speed . Assistant Commissioner Frank Mennilli said the offenders involved in the police pursuit were violent and 'a risk to the community'. He urged any associates to come forward with information. 'This person is well known to them, they know who this person is it is best for them to come forward,' Mr Mennilli said. Mr Mennilli said the officers involved in the incident are suffering. 'My thoughts and prayers go to the family but to also the police involved. 'They are distraught - they really are - these are family members, they've got children the same age. They are doing it very tough at the moment.'

"Two Czech nationals are behind bars after their wedding registrar noticed they showed no affection towards their new husbands. Suspicions were raised further when Algerian Fateh El Fiad, 37, didn't seem to know the full name of his bride Katerina Gaborova, 27. He also appeared to have been 'coached'. Just six days earlier, Zdenka Sudikova, 22, had tied the knot with Mahrez Benbetka, 28, also from Algeria, in another 'sham marriage'. The happiest day of your life? Katerina Gaborova married Fateh El Fiad at Middlesbrough Register Office but the registrar noticed there was no communication, interaction or affection between the couple and reported them . The registrar at Middlesbrough Register Office had no legal right to stop the nuptials but reported concerns after they saw no communication, interaction or affection amongst the couples. Each of the women said they had met their partners in a coffee shop months earlier. A jury took less than half an hour's consideration at Teesside Crown Court to convict the women who were both remanded in custody but their new husbands did not appear with them. Both Benbetka and El Fiad had disappeared during the middle of a previours trial in October and have been on the run over since. They were convicted in their absence. Prosecutor David Brooke said the four entered into sham marriages for the men to gain the rights of EU citizens. Bakery worker Sudikova, who arrived in the UK from Prague in May 2013, married Benbetka, a six-month visa overstayer, on September 24, 2013. The pair, from Middlesbrough, were arrested by immigration officers when they went to get married earlier that month. Katerina Gaborova, 27, (left) and Zdenka Sudikova, 22, (right) are pictured leaving pictured leaving Teesside Crown Court where they were found guilty by a jury after less than half an hour . Benbetka denied that the marriage was a sham and Sudikova told investigators Benbetka proposed unexpectedly, she knew he was an illegal immigrant and she was happy about the marriage. Gaborova and El Fiad, also of Middlesbrough, got married six days after Sudikova and Benbetka on September 30. Gaborova was photographed in her wedding dress outside Middlesbrough register office - in front of the courthouse where she was later convicted. She denied that the marriage was to help El Fiad's immigration status. While El Fiad said he had been refused asylum and claimed he had married another woman according to Islam in London, from whom he had separated. After the women's guilty verdicts today, prosecutor David Brooke said: 'The Crown will be asking for a deportation recommendation from the court in due course.' Paul Abrahams, representing Gaborova, said she was of previous good character and asked for bail for the two women. Nigel Soppitt, for Sudikova, said she had been in the UK for five years, had a job, her parents, roots and stability here and had nothing left for her in the Czech Republic. She had two children, one of whom was undergoing treatment for a kidney disorder. He asked for compassion, saying: 'It would be difficult for her simply to vanish from that young boy's life today.' A judge, Recorder Henry Prosser, said: 'I'm sorry. I do think in this case the risk of non-appearance is so great that I shouldn't grant bail.' He remanded the women in custody until sentencing for all four on February 13 at Newcastle Crown Court. If the men have not been caught by then, they will be sentenced in their absence.

"A father who imported a stun gun disguised as an iPhone  walked free from court yesterday. John Liddiatt, 40, ordered the device online while browsing collectible replica weapons. But when suspicious customs officers investigated the parcel from Singapore they found the replica iPhone and immediately passed it to the police. Walking free: John Liddiatt (pictured) was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for a year . Officers confirmed the device was a weapon and it was re-wrapped before being delivered to Liddiatt at his home address. The dad-of-three was immediately arrested and confessed he had ordered the device, but claimed he had no idea it would be real because of its cheap price. Liddiatt, of Broad Walk, Knowle, Bristol, admitted one count of acquiring a disguised firearm at Bristol Crown Court and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for a year. The black phone, which is in a cover, came with a charger and has two prongs in the bottom which act as pins for the stun gun. Sentencing, Judge Martin Picton told him: 'It is a pretty poor imitation of an iPhone of some description in a box that is meant to look real.' The court heard how weapon collector Liddiatt ordered the stun gun on December 5 2013 from a website he usually used to purchase replica items. George Threlfall, prosecuting, said: 'On December 19 a package was sent from Singapore, addressed to Liddiatt at his home address. 'It was intercepted by customs and officers opened it and revealed what they believed to be a stun gun device. 'This was passed on to police and following examination, firearms officers who confirmed it was a stun gun with the appearance of a mobile phone.' Police then re-packaged the device before an officer, dressed as a postman, delivered it to Liddiatt's home. Unrealistic: Judge Martin Picton told Liddiatt: 'It is a pretty poor imitation of an iPhone of some description in a box that is meant to look real' Weapon: The black phone, which is in a cover, comes with a charger and has two prongs in the bottom which act as pins for the stun gun . He told officers he was an avid collector of replica crossbows, swords and masks which had appeared in movies and did not realise it was an offence to import the stun gun. Jane Chamberlin, defending Liddiatt, said: 'We have a defendant who has kept the item under the stairs and who volunteered it to police. 'It was not going to be put out in the public domain.' After the sentencing, Avon and Somerset police warned of the risks of importing illegal weapons over the internet. Investigating officer PC Chris Downham said: 'It is imperative that items bought from abroad and imported into this country are legal according to UK laws. 'Stun guns like the ones seized in this case are prohibited and dangerous weapons capable of causing considerable harm. 'It's the responsibility of the buyer to ensure they are complying with the law before ordering items over the internet. 'Liddiatt had tested the items when they arrived and was fully aware they were a viable working device.' Liddiatt was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.","John Liddiatt, 40, ordered device online while browsing replica weapons .

"A pregnant mother who died following a car crash saw her two newborn twins before she passed away, her devastated family has revealed. Ashton Hughes, 19, was driving from a doctor's appointment in Spartanburg, South Carolina on Tuesday with her 11-month-old daughter Dixie when she ran into the back of a stopped SUV. The young mother, who was seven months pregnant, was conscious after the crash but complained of pain to her abdomen and was rushed to hospital, where her twins - a boy and a girl - were born by emergency cesarean section. Ashton Gailann Jennings, named after her mother, was born weighing 2 lb 12 oz, while Brantley Wayne Jennings was 3 lb 2 oz, The State reported. Scroll down for video . Saved: Newborn twins Ashton Gailann Jennings and Brantley Wayne Jennings, pictured, were born on Tuesday after their mother was in a car crash. They survived but she later passed away . Tragic: Their mother, Ashton Hughes (pictured with her fiance Zack Jennings) died from her injuries following the c-section but saw the babies before she passed away. Her cause of death has not been determined . The babies are expected to stay in intensive care at Spartanburg Medical Center for the next seven or eight weeks but are expected to survive, their grandfather, Eric Hughes, said. Ashton, who was found to have suffered internal bleeding from the crash, was able to see the twins, he said. Her mother, Misty Fink, told WYFF that her daughter lost too much blood during the emergency delivery and passed away shortly afterwards. Her cause of death has not yet been determined. 'It just hurts my heart so bad,' Mr Hughes said. 'I wish that I could take her place any day.' But he said that he was relieved that her babies survived, including her toddler Dixie, who was in the back of her car at the time of the crash and only suffered a few minor scrapes. 'That's the best part about this,' he said. 'I'm thankful for them being here, but totally saddened by her being gone. The only thing I know we can do is pray and hope for the best.' Loved: She also leaves behind an 11-month-old daughter Dixie, pictured left after her birth, who was in the car but only suffered a scrape. She was engaged to be married to her children's father, Zack . Hughes, who was engaged to be married to the children's father, Zack Jennings, had recently left her job at Chik-Fil-A in Duncan to focus on bringing up her children. Her family said she loved to wear camouflage clothing and have chosen a casket for her which will be lined with camouflage material. Jennings works as an assistant manager at the same Chik-fil-A and will be raising his children with the help of his mother and other relatives. The Spartanburg County Coroner's Office and S.C. Highway Patrol are still investigating the crash, which occurred as she left the Mary Black Memorial Hospital on Skylyn Drive on Tuesday afternoon, to determine what happened. Heartbroken: The family, including Zack (second right) are now trying to come to terms with her death. Her eleven-month-old daughter Dixie, who was in the car at the time, is also pictured . Eric Hughes said he believes his daughter was distracted before driving into the back of the SUV, which had stopped at a traffic light. Its driver was not injured and the SUV was able to be driven from the scene. After the crash, she was able to talk and complained of pain to her stomach, likely from the steering wheel, airbag or seat belt, which she had been wearing, The State reported. Friends are now raising money for her funeral costs and children on a gofundme page.

"The harsh and remarkable challenge that is off-road endurance race the Dakar Rally is no more evident than in these incredible images from day five of the long-running endurance race. Stage five of the 2015 race contested by motorbikes, cars, quad bikes and trucks ran through the space-like terrain between Copiapo and Antofagasta in northern Chile. Originally the Paris to Dakar Rally, running as the name suggests from the French capital to Senegal's largest city, security concerns led to the 2008 race to be cancelled and it has since been run in South America.

Crystal-clear blue skies marked the fifth day of the race that has been running since 1979 and is among the most dangerous in the world . This year's race, the 35th edition of the  'rally raid', began with 665 competitors in 414 vehicles from 53 nations and covers a loop starting and finishing in Buenos Aires. There were 164 motorcycles, 138 cars, 48 quad bikes and 64 trucks aiming to cover the 9,111km (5,661 miles) course that runs through Argentina, Bolivia and Chile over 13 stages in 14 days. The fifth stage covered the arid Atacama Desert that in places could be mistaken for the moon, with crystal-clear skies and mesmerising landscapes.

Not only are competitors tested by a range of dangerous off-road terrain but temperatures that can be searingly hot and freezing cold. At the end of each stage, those involved in the race are given access to a vast array of local produce, which in this case includes octupus, sea urchins, honey from San Pedro de Atacama and Ayllu wine which is from grapes picked at more than 2,500m above sea level in Toconao. Unfortunately, tragedy has struck again in the race that has now seen five people die since the race came to South America, and 28 incidents resulting in fatalities since its first one in 1979. Even more non-competitors have died in tragedies linked to the race. The sheer scale of the race means not all competitors are accounted for at all times and sadly Polish bike rider Michal Hernik didn't arrive at the finish of Tuesday's stage three in Chilecito. When a helicopter was sent in search of him he was found dead on the course without his helmet. With no evidence of a crash, it was on Thursday revealed that his death was likely due to hypothermia and dehydration.

"A woman whose sister and best friend were brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend says she still has nightmares about the day of the attack. Elisa Frank, who has now written a book about her experiences, was 19 when Ahmad Otak stabbed her sister Kimberley in the side while pretending to leave her Wakefield flat. Otak, then 21, went on to stab the 17-year-old another 14 times before licking the bloody knife in his hand and spitting on her body. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Elisa Frank was the only survivor of the 2012 attack that led to the death of her sister . But her ordeal still wasn't over. Otak, an Afghan asylum seeker, then tied Miss Frank up using an electrical flex and forced her to summon best friend Samantha Sykes, 18, to the flat. When Miss Sykes arrived, the crazed killer stabbed her 34 times before slitting her throat - all in front of a distraught Miss Frank. Otak then attempted to flee to France in Miss Frank's car but was foiled by a fellow refugee who raised the alarm. A year later, the 'sadistic' and 'inadequate' killer was jailed for life with a minimum 34-year term by a judge at Leeds Crown Court. Miss Frank, now 21, was in court to hear Otak jailed but says despite the lengthy sentence, she will never get over the death of her sister and best friend. Tragedy: Kim Frank (left) was stabbed 15 times by Ahmad Otak who then licked licked her blood off his knife . Victim: Elisa's best friend Samantha Sykes, 18, was also killed by Otak, who slit her throat and stabbed her . Much missed: Elisa still has nightmares about the night Kim (pictured right) and Sam (left) were killed . 'I still have nightmares every single night,' she says. 'It started out being about the event, then sometimes I'd see Kim as a ghost. 'I try not to think about it during the day. If I do, it's too overwhelming.' Miss Frank had been in a relationship with Otak, who arrived in the UK in 2007, off and on for several years and at one point, the couple had planned to marry. She had been living in a children's home with her sister, with the girls placed in care aged 13 and 14, after their mother decided she was unable to cope. The girls were still in care when Miss Frank met Otak and struck up a relationship, although she soon tired of his violent and controlling behaviour. Nevertheless, the relationship continued until September 2012 when Miss Frank finally decided that she had had enough and ended it. Evil: Afghan asylum seeker Ahmad Otak attempted to flee to France but was foiled by a brave fellow refugee . Aftermath: Police outside Elisa's Wakefield flat following the double murders . Traumatised: Elisa still has nightmares about the day her sister and best friend were murdered . Memories: Elisa has gone on to write a book, while Otak (right) will remain in prison for the rest of his life . Tragically, her decision was to have appalling consequences and Miss Frank says she still feels guilty about allowing Otak into her life. But despite the nightmares, she hopes to keep her sister and best friend's memory alive and has written a book, The Borderline Diaries, which charts the murder and her recovery over the days and weeks that followed. 'If I didn't have writing to focus on I would be lost,' she admits. 'It's all I do, it's something I use to get through.' Following the murders, Miss Frank spent months in hospital and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder, the latter giving her book its title. She describes the account, which runs to 53,000 words, as creative non-fiction rather than autobiography, but admitted the prospect of having her story made public was scary. 'Me and my sister used to write a lot,' she explains. 'We used to talk about getting published, so I feel like this is for her. When you write about someone, it keeps their memory alive.' 'Two girls have been murdered in Barden Road, stabbed to death, and I was there when it happened. I was there and I survived it. I don't know why. Maybe you think I am not making sense, maybe that's why you're not responding to me. I am aware I don't make sense. Just come back please. Come back and I'll make it all better and for once in my life I will help someone else, you and Sammy. I need you here and I'll wrap Band Aids around your wounds, for they should have been mine. I know I have not been there for you over this past year. I know I have failed you as a sister and a best friend. I'm sorry for all those times you came round to the house of horrors and I didn't answer. I pretended there was nobody in. I know there's no excuse but he wouldn't let me answer to you, he was always jealous of you, he knew how much you meant to me and that Sammy was the only friend I have ever had. I'll write again soon and I won't stop writing until you are returned to me. Promise me one thing? One day you will come back to me, but don't wait too long. I love you forever and always. Me and you twins for life, right? Distance never kept us apart before.' Taken from The Borderline Diaries by Elisa Frank .","Elisa Frank's sister and best friend were murdered by Ahmad Otak .

"The number of patients languishing for hours on trolleys in A&E has doubled in a week. A total of 16,234 patients waited on trolleys for between four and 12 hours last week, the worst since records began in 2010. Another 241 were waiting for more than 12 hours, again the highest number ever recorded. These are seriously ill patients whom doctors have decided need to be admitted to a hospital ward. But a critical shortage of beds means they have to wait hours for one to become available. Ambulances queuing up outside Wrexham Maelor Hospital earlier this week as number visiting A&E departments soared . This week an unprecedented 13 hospitals declared major incidents due to soaring numbers arriving in A&E. They called in off-duty staff, cancelled non-urgent operations and created makeshift wards. Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: ‘These figures show the Tory A&E crisis is intensifying … David Cameron’s failure to produce a plan to deal with this cannot carry on. 'Their complacency is exposing far too many vulnerable people to too much risk.’ The figures for last week also show nearly 11,000 ambulances queued outside A&E for more than half an hour – more than twice as many as this time last year. Andy Burnham MP, pictured, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: ‘These figures show the Tory A&E crisis is intensifying' The crisis has been blamed on patients being unable to see their GP, particularly out of hours, forcing them to go to casualty instead. Cuts to social care also mean hospitals cannot discharge many elderly patients, causing a bed shortage. The Government injected £700million into hospitals in the autumn. Yesterday NHS England, which oversees the health service, gave further details of how the money is being used, such as funding the equivalent of 4,500 full-time nurses and 700 doctors – including locums, staff from overseas and overtime by existing employees – and an extra 5,000 beds.","16,234 patients waited on trolleys in A&E for between four and 12 hours .
