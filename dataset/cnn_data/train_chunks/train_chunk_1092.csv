"TV presenter Eamonn Holmes sparked outrage today after an on-air outburst where he dismissed a report claiming one in two children had bullied - and called his co-host a 'wimp'. Sky News Sunrise host Holmes, 52, condemned an Ofsted report which claimed that almost one half of all pupils suffered some degree of bullying at school. Reviewing the day’s national newspapers on the Sunrise show at 7am, father-of-four Eamonn slammed the findings as 'unbelievable'. Bullying discussion: Eamonn Holmes and co-presenter Charlotte Hawkins fall out over the bullying statistics that show half of children have suffered . He went on to call school bullying 'just life' and 'growing up' and mocked it as just 'someone sticking their tongue out'. Horrified co-presenter Charlotte Hawkins, 37, was clearly stunned by his remarks and told him: 'If someone feels bullied that means they are being bullied, surely?'. But Eamonn, who previously presented GMTV for 13 years, then turned on Charlotte and replied: 'That’s why the world is in the state that it is, people like you just being wimpy about everything'. Today furious anti-bullying campaigners and Twitter users slammed Eamonn as a 'bully' himself. Lauren Seager Smith, of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, based at the National Children’s Bureau, said: 'Bullying is a serious issue that can have a devastating effect on the lives of children and young people. 'Children and young people who experience bullying need to know they can speak out, that they will be heard, and that they will be taken seriously.' Claude Knight, director of Kidscape, . said: 'It is so unfortunate that we should still be hearing comments . such as, ‘Bullying is part of growing up’. 'To say to children and young people that it is somehow OK for them to be subjected to bullying is totally unacceptable. 'We must remember that there are long-term effects for the targets, and indeed for the bullies. 'If we feed young people the myth . overtly, or by messages of acceptance, that bullying is ""normal . behaviour"" then we are failing them. Defiant: Eamonn Holmes later took to Twitter to back his points about bullying and argue with a parent who claimed his child had been a target of bullies . 'It is possible to create . environments in which bullying is defined appropriately and not . tolerated, and in which aggression and violence are viewed as wholly . inappropriate types of behaviour. 'We work with a large number of . bullied children and their families each year, and it has to be said . that they will feel very distressed that their suffering and despair has . been dismissed so glibly.' Eamonn, married to Ruth Langsford, was commenting on the front page of the ‘i’ newspaper, which carried the shock Ofsted figures. The report, ‘No place for bullying’ stated that almost half of pupils surveyed at primary and secondary school felt picked on or bullied at some point. Incidents related to friendships, appearance, their family situation, sexuality, race, religion, ability, being seen as clever, disability or a combination of factors. One secondary school pupil told the questionnaire she had been bullied 'basically for being me'. Eamonn said: 'The i leads on figures from an Ofsted report: almost half of children are bullied at school, now that I find just unbelievable. One out of two children. 'What do they constitute as bullying? Someone sticking their tongue out at them? There’s bullying, let’s take that very seriously but to say that one out of two children is put upon at school. 'Maybe that’s just life, maybe that’s what it’s called.' Co-presenter Charlotte Hawkins replied: 'If someone feels bullied that means they are being bullied, surely? Strong views: Charlotte Hawkins disagreed with her co-presenter, saying if a child felt bullied it was a case of bullying . 'If half the children feel they are being bullied whatever form that takes because for some people it might have to be quite severe for it to have an impact but for other people even taunts can make them feel like they are being bullied and that should count in my opinion.' Eamonn retorted: 'Don’t bully me. See, that’s why the world is in the state that it is, people like you just being wimpy about everything.' Charlotte said: 'You can’t blame me for bullying you one minute and then call me wimpy the next.' Eamonn summed up the piece by stating: 'One in two children are bullied at school. Don’t believe it, it’s called growing up basically.' Eamonn Holmes was condemned as 'uninformed and crass' by campaigners and bullying victims. On Twitter, Kevin Baxter said: 'Did . @eamonnholmes just bully his coworker? And now, just says he dispelled . the research? Errr that’s YOUR opinion @StopBullying'. Eamonn wrote back: '@Mathmosman and . your opinion is that every second child is being bullied ? Get a grip . man , u r doing the fight against real buulying no favs (sic)' Another user, Olivia Fielding . tweeted: '@EamonnHolmes Scathing public attitudes like yours can stop . children who really are being bullied from coming forward.' Lively: The pair clashed during a paper review on Sky News this morning . Steve Coffey wrote to Charlotte . Hawkins on the micro blogging site: '@SkyCharlotte Have asked Eamonn to . meet with my daughter, so she can tell him all about being bullied, . strangly he has now gone very quite (sic)!' Later, Mr Coffey, 38, from . Hampshire said his daughter was bullied so badly between the ages of nine and 12 that she was forced to move schools twice. He said: 'I am very sad that a . well-known personality such as Mr Holmes would say such a thing, his . comments were uninformed and crass. 'I asked him to meet with my daughter so she could explain her thoughts on the subject. 'He refused, referred to me as a ""deep thinker"" and told me I could start a fight in an empty room. 'Really Sky News and its viewers deserve better.' Mother Debbie Young, 47, was forced to move her daughter Samantha, eight, out of her school after she was tormented by school bullies. Debbie, an assistant to Stroud MP Neil Carmichael, said she was 'disgusted' by Eamonn Holmes’ comments about bullying. She said: 'It is awful, I can’t believe someone has actually said that. You would have thought he would have known better. 'For me, teasing is a fact of life but there is a whole difference between teasing and bullying and to say that is completely out of order. 'My view is that we will never stop bullying initially - it’s how you go about handling it that’s important.' Tonight Eamonn Holmes said: 'I wouldn't ever condone bullying, I just questioned the stats - and I ask everyone else to do the same. 'As an interviewer my job is to question and challenge - it is important we differentiate between what is true damaging bullying and what is a bit of playground life, otherwise the smaller stuff stops the serious stuff being dealt with. 'Regular Sunrise viewers know Charlotte and I take opposing views on a subject most days - the idea is to stimulate debate which it clearly did.'","Refused to believe Ofsted report that suggests half of schoolchildren have suffered at the hands of bullies .

"It is a touching story of kindness and friendship that spans continents and has endured for years. A British grandmother who refused to give up on the Vietnamese boy suffering from a mystery skin condition after meeting him in an orphanage when he was aged just three. Now the loving tale of the 15-year friendship between Brenda Smith, 78, and Min Anh - who is nicknamed Fish because of his debilitating scaly skin condition - is being told for the first time. Every year since they met, devoted Brenda has left her home in Benfleet, Essex, to spend three months in Vietnam, visiting Min Anh and taking him out for day trips by motorbike. Scroll down for a preview clip . Extraordinary kindness: British grandmother Brenda Smith with Min Anh . during a recent visit. The pair met 15 years ago and Brenda as flown out . to see him every year since . The beginning: Brenda said the orphan, who is suffering from a debilitating skin condition sat in her lap at the orphanage and stayed for hours . The moving story of how Brenda single-handedly took on hospital authorities and transformed Min Anh’s life is the subject of a new Extraordinary People documentary. Min Anh, nicknamed Ka, or fish, by fellow orphans at Tu Du Peace Village where he lives, was tied to his bed for hours because staff could not stop him scratching his itchy, scaly skin. But Brenda, a grandmother of four and great grandmother of five, was determined to find medical help for Min Anh, to improve his everyday life, and his long term future. Brenda, who has been widowed twice, first fell in love with Vietnam in 1995 when she cycled across the country for charity with her second husband Baz. Close: Brenda has returned to Vietnam to see Min Anh every year for three months at a time . Helping hand: Brenda was able to convince orphanage staff to untie Min Anh and found ways to ease his condition . The couple met scores of children who had severe disabilities and birth defects caused by Agent Orange, a dangerous chemical left in the soil and water supply after the Vietnam War. The pair returned to the UK determined to help the children, but as Baz took part in a charity swim he tragically suffered a heart attack and died suddenly at the age of 55. Heartbroken Brenda planned one more visit to Vietnam in her husband’s memory. But while volunteering at an orphanage, she fell in love with brave Min Anh, who was dumped as a baby because of his scaly skin caused by a genetic condition. 'All he wanted to do was sit in my lap,' she said. 'I sat there for a couple of hours and didn’t want to move. I just fell in love with him and it’s been like that ever since.' Min Anh filled a gap in the lonely pensioner’s life after losing her beloved husband, giving her a new purpose and a reason to keep returning to Vietnam. Painful: Min Anh's skin condition is a genetic disease but his exact diagnosis is yet to be determined . Min Anh has often been strapped to chairs and beds by orphanage staff in a bid to stop him scratching his skin . The pair found a way of communicating, even though Min Anh, now 18, doesn’t speak English, and Brenda knows no Vietnamese. The determined widow, who has three grown up daughters, took on hospital authorities who left Min Anh tied to his bed for hours because they didn’t know how to treat him. 'When I first went to see him at Tu Du Hospital, he was tied up from morning to night, so he wouldn’t scratch himself,' said Brenda. 'The staff didn’t know how to help him. I hated to see him like that, without any toys or amusement.' But Brenda’s persistence paid off, and staff allowed the kindly English lady to untie Min Anh and take him out for day trips around Ho Chi Min City. Trips out: Brenda has taken the orphan on numerous trips in his home city to improve his quality of life . Care: Brenda and Minh have formed an unbreakable bond that has lasted for 15 years . A Vietnamese friend loaned Brenda a motorbike, so she could drive around the streets with Min Anh, taking in all the sights and sounds. Brenda took her young friend to shops and restaurants, buying him meals, clothes and toys, and treating him like her adoptive son. 'When I took him out for pizza, he ate normally. He just needs someone to spend time with him,' said Brenda. 'Just walking around the supermarket is like a treat to Min Anh because the cold air soothes his skin. 'When we got back to the ward, he’d walk back to his bed and tie himself up again because he was used to it.' All smiles: The pair are joined by an orphanage worker in Vietnam . Loving: Brenda with her late husband Barry, who had resolved to help the Vietnamese children before his untimely death . Adventurous: Brenda borrowed a friend's motorbike for days out . Brenda admits her daughters Carol, 55, . Deborah, 52, and Claire, 38, at first thought she was crazy to be so . attached to a boy on the other side of the world. 'They’d say: ""Oh mum, why do you want to speak your time worrying about a boy who lives thousands of miles away?"",' she said. Brenda, a former secretary who has no medical knowledge, spent years trying to find a doctor to diagnose Min Anh’s skin condition but had no idea where to start. She said: 'When it was time to go back to England it was heartbreaking. 'Min Anh always said he loves me very much, and understands that I have to go home. But he’d be waiting for me. 'I knew if I could get him help, he wouldn’t be tied up anymore.' The documentary, A Boy They Call Fish, follows Brenda’s most recent visit to Vietnam in early 2012, as an expert dermatologist is called in to try to diagnose and treat Min Anh. Brenda is also determined to find a friend for the teenager, to look out for him and take him on days out when she is not there. The film follows her efforts to find answers for Min Anh’s rare skin condition and to transform the boy’s life for the better.

"A grandmother who woke to find an intruder dressed as the Grim Reaper standing in her bedroom ripped off his mask and discovered the man was her neighbour. Widow Sharron Mayers, 54, was fast asleep when she was woken by mystery man dressed as the Grim Reaper in a white mask and long black cape. Grandmother Mrs Mayers tried to sink her teeth into the 6ft 4in intruder - but had taken out her dentures before bed. Don't fear the reaper: Philip Evans, pictured in his scary outfit, left, broke into the home of grandmother Sharron Mayers, right. He received a suspended prison sentence for the prank . A court heard she then bravely pulled the man’s mask off to reveal her neighbour Philip Evans, 35. Mrs Mayers said: 'His arm was inches from my face so I thought: ""I’ll bite him"". 'But unfortunately I’d taken my false teeth out at bedtime.'

Rampage: Evans - pictured outside court - was drunk when he broke into the house . Mrs Mayers suffered minor injuries to her neck and arms and needed counselling and medication. Father-of-four Evans claimed admitted causing actual bodily harm to Mrs Mayers - but blamed it on a drunken prank. She told the court: 'It has cost me £1,000 to move house because I no longer felt safe in my own home. I still can’t sleep a year after it happened.' Trainee plumber Evans, of Beaumaris, was given a 45-week prison sentence at Caernarfon Crown Court. He was ordered to pay Mrs Mayers £750 compensation and made the subject of a five-year restraining order. Judge Peter Heywood told Evans: 'This was a prank which went horribly wrong.' The court ordered Evans’ Grim Reaper outfit to be destroyed. After the cae Mrs Mayers, who lives alone, said: 'I was asleep when I heard heavy footsteps coming up my stairs. 'The bedroom door opened and in the dim light I could see the Grim Reaper standing there. 'I thought my time had come.' Sentenced: Evans was handed suspended prison sentence at Caernafon Crown Court (pictured) Mrs Mayers jumped out of bed but the masked man put his hands around her throat. She said: 'I knew there was a man behind the mask so I reached out and quickly pulled at it to reveal Philip Evans.

"The Bank of England today resisted calls to slash the interest rate to zero and has also stopped pumping more cash into the struggling UK economy. IMF boss Christine Lagarde had urged the Bank to lower its base rate further and use more quantitative easing to help the UK weather the . eurozone debt crisis. But this lunchtime interest rates were held at their record . low of 0.5 per cent and additional QE was also ruled out despite economists 'seriously considering' it. The most recent £50 billion injection into the Bank’s quantitative easing programme took place in February but members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have vetoed increasing the stock of asset purchases from £325 billion. Refusal: The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has decided not to pump more money into the UK economy . The decision comes as the pressure mounts on political leaders to draw up a firm action plan to tackle the mounting eurozone crisis, with Spain appearing to move closer to taking an EU bailout and a crucial election in Greece imminent. But hopes for the recovery were boosted earlier today when a closely-watched survey of the powerhouse services sector in May revealed robust growth, allaying some concerns over a worse-than-expected report on the smaller manufacturing sector last Friday. Pressure on the Bank to implement more stimulus measures has been mounting in recent weeks after official figures showed the UK’s double-dip recession was deeper than previously thought, with a 0.3 per cent fall in the first quarter of 2012. And inflation continued to fall in April, providing more leeway for a fresh money injection. While the Bank’s decision echoed that of the European Central Bank yesterday, China’s central bank moved to shore up its powerhouse economy by slashing its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008, dropping the one-year deposit rate to 3.25 per cent from 3.5 per cent. China’s move boosted confidence on equity markets with the FTSE 100 Index in London jumping another 30 points after the decision, while the MPC’s unchanged position strengthened the pound against most major currencies. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said he still expects an additional £50 billion QE boost in August - but action could be taken as soon as next month. He said: 'We consider that it would be wrong to rule out more QE. The crisis in the euro area poses a number of very obvious downside risks to the British economy. 'Meanwhile UK growth looks set to remain below trend, at best, in any case over the next year.' Anna Leach, the CBI’s head of economic analysis, said the MPC’s decision would have been a 'tricky one'. She said: 'It seems that a ‘wait and see’ position has been adopted for the moment. The ongoing crisis in the euro area will continue to put pressure on fragile business conditions for the foreseeable future. 'But we still expect the UK economy to improve modestly later in the year, with further falls in inflation providing some support to family incomes.'",IMF boss Christine Lagarde had said both were needed to boost the ailing UK economy .
"Researchers have claimed a major breakthrough in the fight against obesity - and say they have found a genetic switch that controls our metabolism. Researchers have identified a protein that controls metabolism - and used it to dramatically reduce the development of obesity and diabetes in mice. By manipulating the biochemical process that underlies cells' energy-burning abilities, researchers say they could now develop new weight loss therapies. By manipulating the biochemical process that underlies how we burn energy, researchers say they could now develop radical new weight loss therapies. The new findings show that reducing the amount of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) protein in fat and liver dramatically reduces the development of obesity and diabetes in mice. NNMT is known to process vitamin B3 and has been previously linked with certain types of cancers. The new process hinges on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle, in which cellular reactions are sped up, thereby generating more energy. This is what allows some people to eat as much as they want, but never put on weight. Investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) published their research in the April 10 issue of the journal Nature. The new findings show that reducing the amount of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) protein in fat and liver dramatically reduces the development of obesity and diabetes in mice. 'With this discovery, we now have a means of metabolic manipulation that could help speed energy production and lead to weight loss,' said senior author Barbara Kahn. The new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle, in which cellular reactions are sped up, thereby generating more energy. 'We all know people who can seemingly eat whatever they want and not gain weight,' explains Kahn. 'Part of the reason for this natural weight control owes to basal cellular metabolism – the body's inherent rate of burning energy. 'A futile cycle is one way to speed up energy utilization in cells.' The breakthrough also used a technique already used to treat other diseases in humans, raising hopes it could be available soon. 'Our findings are particularly exciting because the antisense oligonucleotide [ASO] technology we used to inhibit the NNMT gene in our study is already being used to treat other diseases in humans,' said Dr Kahn. The new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle, in which cellular reactions are sped up, thereby generating more energy - and allows some people to eat as much as they want without getting fat. More than one-third of the U.S. adult population is currently obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 'Obesity is a serious economic burden to our healthcare system and a major risk factor for developing insulin resistance and diabetes,' says Dr Kahn. NNMT is an enzyme that processes vitamin B3 and has been linked to certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer's disease, said co-corresponding author Qin Yang, MD, PhD, a Klarman Scholar in the Kahn laboratory at BIDMC and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. 'Now we have identified an entirely new role for this enzyme in fat tissue, and that is to regulate energy metabolism,' he said. The investigators first confirmed that levels of NNMT were increased in obese and diabetic mice. 'In a comparison of genetic profiles of fat from mice that were either prone to or protected from developing diabetes, we discovered that the animals that were prone to develop diabetes had a lot of NNMT in the fat and liver,' said Yang. The team discovered that NNMT inhibition speeds up the so called futile cycle, resulting in more dietary calories being burned for energy and fewer calories being incorporated into fat. Importantly, notes Kahn, the team used antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology to knock down the NNMT gene. 'Because ASOs have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] for the treatment of genetic causes of elevated cholesterol or hyperlipidemia, as well as the treatment of a viral eye infection, it's possible that clinical trials to test an ASO anti-obesity therapy in humans could readily move forward. 'NNMT looks to be a promising target for future therapeutic development. 'Furthermore, because obesity is associated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, disease states in which NNMT is also elevated, an NNMT ASO could potentially also be beneficial in managing these other devastating conditions.'","Protein called NNMT found to help regulate the metabolism .

"Horrific attack: Munir Ahmad, 39, pictured, was cut with a kitchen knife by Luke Sheldon, 17, after making him drive to an industrial estate . This is the horrific injury inflicted on a taxi driver when his throat was cut in a robbery by a boy of 17 who escaped with just £100. Luke Sheldon slashed 39-year old Munir Ahmad with a kitchen knife after booking his private hire cab and asking him to take him to an industrial estate. As Mr Ahmad lay reeling on the ground with blood spurting from his wounds, Sheldon drove off in his Vauxhall Vectra taxi and left him for dead. He was arrested after smashing the vehicle into another car. Mr Ahmad needed 14 stitches for deep cut beneath his chin but miraculously escaped more serious injury after the blade missed his jugular vein. Police discovered drifter Sheldon from Middleton, Greater Manchester had robbed another taxi driver at knifepoint the day before. At Bolton Crown Court, he admitted causing grievous bodily harm, robbery and possessing a bladed article and was locked away in a Young Offender Institution for six years and eight months. An order banning his identity was lifted by the judge in the case. The court heard how Sheldon and another man Stephen Hastie, 25, had robbed a taxi driver at knifepoint on November 14 last year after he picked them up from the Middleton area. He handed over his takings and ran off and the pair drove off in his car, which was crashed into two parked vehicles nearby. The two yobs then got out and walked off. At about 9.30pm on Tuesday 15 November 2011, Mr Ahmad was outside the Harbord Harbord pub, when Sheldon asked to be taken to the Stakehill Industrial Estate in Middleton. Once there Sheldon pulled out at a knife and slit Mr Ahmad's throat. the stricken cabbie staggered out of his car in a bid to escape but was caught by Sheldon who tried to stab him again. Mr Ahmad grabbed his arm to protect himself from a further blow from the knife before the thug drove off in his car containing the takings, a sat nav and three mobile phones. Sheldon crashed the cab into parked car at the junction of Kingsley Road and Stanycliffe Lane. Lucky to be alive: Mr Ahmad's throat in the aftermath of the incident. He has stopped working in the area . Mr Ahmad later refused to work as a car driver in the town again and is now a taxi driver elsewhere.Mr Ahmad, a father of two from Rochdale, said: 'I'm pleased with the sentence but the fact is I think I'm lucky to be alive. 'He slashed my throat and I got out of the car to run away but I slipped and he caught up with me on the floor. He tried to slash me again and I held his arm. I told him there's money and a mobile phone in the car. I thought I was going to die. 'I was shouting ""someone please help me save my life"". The doctor said I was very lucky to survive.' Mr Ahmad who has driven a taxi for nine years says he is so traumatised by the incident he initially thought he would give up his job altogether. Young thug: Sheldon can now be named after he was jailed for almost seven years for the attack . 'It was such a big shock. I just want to have a safe life. There's too much risk in this job. I'm too scared to work at night after what happened to me.' Mr Ahmad has been driving for Middleton-based private hire firm Diamond Cars for four years. Mr Ahmad's boss Shafaq Khan said: 'That knife could have killed him and I think that the guy wanted to kill him. He is very, very lucky. 'Being a taxi driver is a very risky business these days. These people who attack taxi drivers are cowards.' Hastie, of Middleton, admitted robbery and possession of a bladed article and was jailed for five years. Today Det Con Laura Stubbs, of Rochdale CID, said: 'Both defendants carried out a knife point robbery on an innocent taxi driver who was out trying to earn a living. 'Sheldon then followed this up with a violent robbery on another taxi driver the following day. 'He suffered appalling injuries and was extremely fortunate not to have been more seriously injured or killed. 'Both are clearly comfortable carrying weapons and threatening innocent people in order to steal what amounts to relatively small amounts of cash and it is only right they have both been imprisoned. 'We work closely with private hire companies to prevent incidents such as this from happening, but when they do occur they are thoroughly investigated and we will do everything we can to identify offenders and bring them to justice.'","Luke Sheldon slashed the throat of Munir Ahmad, 39, with a kitchen knife .

"Parents often ponder what their children will look like when they grow up. Now, a computer could answer the question in less than a minute. University of Washington researchers have developed software that automatically generates images of a young child's face as it ages through a lifetime. Scroll down for video . Using one photo of a 3 year-old, the software automatically renders images of his face at multiple ages while keeping his identity (and the milk moustache) The technique is the first fully automated approach for aging babies to adults that works with variable lighting, expressions and poses. ‘Aging photos of very young children from a single photo is considered the most difficult of all scenarios, so we wanted to focus specifically on this very challenging case,’ said Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. ‘We took photos of children in completely unrestrained conditions and found that our method works remarkably well.’ The research team has posted a paper on the new technique and will present its findings at the June IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Columbus, Ohio. The software determines the average pixel arrangement from thousands of random Internet photos of faces in different age and gender brackets.An algorithm then finds correspondences between the averages from each bracket and calculates the average change in facial shape and appearance between ages.These changes are then applied to a new child's photo to predict how she or he will appear for any subsequent age up to 80.The researchers tested their rendered images against those of 82 actual people photographed over a span of years.People could not distinguish between the real and rendered images. The shape and appearance of a baby's face – and variety of expressions – often change drastically by adulthood, making it hard to model and predict that change. This technique leverages the average of thousands of faces of the same age and gender, then calculates the visual changes between groups as they age to apply those changes to a new person's face. In an experiment asking random users to identify the correct aged photo for each example, they found that users picked the automatically rendered photos about as often as the real-life ones. ‘Our extensive user studies demonstrated age progression results that are so convincing that people can't distinguish them from reality,’ said co-author Steven Seitz, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering. ‘When shown images of an age-progressed child photo and a photo of the same person as an adult, people are unable to reliably identify which one is the real photo.’ Spitting image: Here, real photos of a child (right in each pair) are compared to images that used the software (left in each pair) to generate an aged face, with surprisingly accurate results. As the software only deals with faces, however, hair and other features like clothing are added artificially . Real-life photos of children are difficult to age-progress, partly due to variable lighting, shadows, funny expressions and even milk moustaches. To compensate for these effects, the algorithm first automatically corrects for tilted faces, turned heads and inconsistent lighting, then applies the computed shape and appearance changes to the new child's face. Perhaps the most common application of age progression work is for rendering older versions of missing children. These renderings usually are created manually by an artist who uses photos of the child as well as family members, and editing software to account for common changes to a child's face as it ages, including vertical stretching, wrinkles and a longer nose. But this process takes time, and it's significantly harder to produce an accurate image for children younger than age five, when facial features more closely resemble that of a baby. Using the software, parents could discover what their children will look like when they are older . In each pair of these images showing babies growing up, the rendered image is on the left and a real photo of the same age is on the right (again, hair and clothing are artificially added) Can you tell which is which? In tests, people were unable to discern between real and rendered images . Through the ages: The software scans thousands of Internet pictures to create an 'average face' before applying its aging algorithm . The automatic age-progression software can run on a standard computer and takes about 30 seconds to generate results for one face. It is not yet available to the public, however. While this method considered gender and age, the research team also hopes to incorporate other identifiers such as ethnicity, and cosmetic factors such as hair whitening and wrinkles, to build a robust enough method for representing every human face. ‘I'm really interested in trying to find some representation of everyone in the world by leveraging the massive amounts of captured face photos,’ Kemelmacher-Shlizerman said. ‘The aging process is one of many dimensions to consider.’ The company says they will soon have a mobile app and website tool where people can try the technology by uploading their own photos.","Researchers have developed software that can predict aging .

"Shawn Smith got roped into joining his two mates on the overnight duty-free trip to the continent to buy cheap tobacco while drinking down the pub . A father who went to his local for pre-Christmas drinks with friends woke up 300 miles away in France - and was stuck in Paris for a week because he didn't have a passport. Shawn Smith got roped into joining his two mates on the overnight duty-free trip to the continent to buy cheap tobacco while drinking down the pub. Incredibly, the 48-year-old who has never left the UK and doesn't even own a passport, managed to get through unchallenged in Dover, France and Belgium while he snoozed in the back of his friend's car on December 1. But he was stopped by customs officers on the return leg at Calais and was ordered to go to the British Consulate 180 miles in Paris to apply for an emergency passport. Mr Smith was forced to stay in the French capital for a week due to complications in the application over his place of birth, Germany, which cost £99. He also shelled out £450 on food and accommodation, surviving on guest house breakfast croissants and fast-food meals at McDonalds. The self-employed plasterer eventually arrived back home exhausted in Worcester on December 10 and is now warning people not to leave the UK without their passport. Father-of-six Shawn said: 'I'd only gone out for a couple of quiet pints with my pals at the local pub. 'They told me they were going to go across to Anderlecht in Belgium to stock on tobacco. 'Apparently you can legally buy 60 packets and that would last me the year for a faction of the cost of the price in Britain. They asked if I wanted to go along and I thought 'why not'. The father-of-six's duty-free route: He leaves Worcester on the overnight duty-free trip to Belgium and incredibly managed to get through Dover, France and Belgium without a passport while he snoozed in the back of his friend's car on December 1 but was stopped on the return leg coming back through Calais and sent to Paris to wait for the emergency travel document . But he was stopped by customs officers on the return leg at Calais and spent the next week in  Paris to apply for an emergency passport, while there he spent over £50 on phone calls to his partner, Judy Ballard, to reassure her he was safe and sent her postcards (pictured) 'We planned to do an over-nighter, as a bit of an adventure. I just remember laughing a lot and my friend who wasn't drinking drove us down to Dover. 'I must have fallen asleep when we got to the port because the next thing I knew I woke up and was in France and we were on the way to Belgium. 'I thought to myself it was strange no one had asked me for my passport because I don't actually have one. I just thought because we were in Europe you don't need one. 'We went to a 24-hour hypermarket and filled up with tobacco and were coming back when I got stopped at Calais. Mr Smith was forced to stay in the French capital for a week due to complications in the application for the emergency travel document (right) which cost £99 (left) The temporary passport issued to Mr Smith to allow him to finally return home to Worcester after the ordeal . 'I was shocked when they told me I had to go to Paris to fill out the forms for an emergency passport but I had no choice. 'I don't want to see Paris again, although it is a beautiful city.' Shawn only managed to survive the eight days in France because his brother wired him cash when he drained his own funds. He also spent over £50 on phone calls to his partner, Judy Ballard, to reassure her he was safe. Shawn has now praised the British Consulate who managed to find him a cheaper room for just £17 a night. The 48-year-old visited the sites around the city of Paris during his French nightmare such as the Arc de Triomphe (pictured by Mr Smith) Mr Smith's receipt for his first hotel, Sarl Hotel, where he stayed in Paris, part of the £450 he had to spent to survive in the French capital . He added: 'I only went abroad to save cash on tobacco but it ended up costing me a fortune. It was an expensive hangover but something to tell the grandkids about. 'The British Consulate was excellent. They did everything they could.' Under the 1995 Schengen Agreement passports are not checked at the borders of some EU countries, but this doesn't apply to the UK. And official EU advice states clearly: 'You must still show a valid passport when travelling to or from the United Kingdom.' They planned to stock-up on the cut-price roll-ups which is just a third of the price of British tobacco.","Shawn Smith joined his friends on a trip to buy cheap tobacco in Belgium .

"You may or may not have noticed, but the grand global football extravaganza that is the World Cup begins this Thursday (12 June) in Brazil – and the clamour to fit in with this sporting hurrah and share in a little of its thunder is now reaching a state close to frenzy. And the latest interloper to climb onto . what is already a fairly crowded bandwagon – along with all the beer . makers, fast-food manufacturers and sugary drink producers – is the . ArcelorMittal Orbit, the iconic sculpture which dominates London’s . Olympic Park. Going for gold: The ArcelorMittal Orbit as it will appear if England win the World Cup (left), and as it usually looks . This enormous, elaborate pile of steel rises to 114.5 metres (376ft) in what is now officially known as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Famously and strikingly red, it has announced that it will swap its ruddy hue for a celebratory coat of gold if England make it to the World Cup Final on 13 July – and end up lifting the fabled trophy. Some might say that this is a promise akin to a parent telling their child that they can go to Disney World if they come top of the class in every single one of their summer exams (including maths), then win every race at school sports day (including the 1500 metres). After years of hype and over-expectation, levels of belief in England’s football team are generally low, and many would deem it a success if Roy Hodgson’s men were to emerge from a group stage where they face Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica – let alone go on to eclipse the likes of Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Spain to win the entire tournament. But there is no doubt that the ArcelorMittal Orbit would look very fetching in gold – as the mock-up image above demonstrates. A very modern artwork: The sculpture was put in place as a striking companion piece to the Olympic Stadium . The move would echo the decision to honour Britain’s many champions at the 2012 Olympics, which saw post-boxes in gold medallists’ home towns given the Midas touch. The ArcelorMittal Orbit was created by artist Sir Anish Kapoor and designer Cecil Balmond, designed to be a landmark structure to stand next to the Olympic Stadium. Like much of the rest of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the sculpture was closed off after the games as the space around the stadium was transformed for public use. The sculpture and the park reopened at the beginning of April, offering a two-tier observation deck with views that stretch across the capital – encompassing football sites such as Wembley in the distance, and Arsenal’s Emirates stadium nearer at hand. The ArcelorMittal Orbit will further embrace the spirit of the World Cup with screenings of all England fixtures at the EastTwenty Bar & Kitchen at its base. Tickets for the observation decks are £15 for adults, £7 for kids (arcelormittalorbit.com).","Striking London artwork to have makeover if England win the World Cup .

"A police officer who was told she could have appendicitis was shocked to discover her stomach pains were actually due to a tumour the size of a rugby ball. Emma Brown had gone into her local GP surgery suffering from a cough and pain in her lower right abdomen. Doctors suspected appendicitis and the 40-year-old was immediately sent to hospital for tests. But she was shocked when scans came back to reveal the huge growth on her right ovary, measuring 173.6mm by 160.3mm – roughly the same size and shape as a rugby ball. Scroll down for video . Emma Brown had originally gone in to her local GP with a stomach complaint only to be told it could be appendicitis but she was sent to hospital where scans revealed the massive rugby-balled size growth . Response officer Emma, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, admitted she had felt scared when she heard the cancer diagnosis. 'Initially they didn't show us the pictures so it didn't really make sense. I had lived with it,' she said. 'It was only when I saw the scan pictures that I was taken aback. Seeing this mass really shocked me. 'I was scared but I decided to face it with a smile and as much courage as I could muster.' Doctors later told the response officer for Wiltshire Police that the growth was cancerous . The hospital scans showed the giant tumor, which had grown to 173.6mm by 160.3mm on her right ovary - roughly the same size as a rugby ball . She added: 'Watching programmes you think, 'how would you react to that? 'I was obviously surprised that there was this mass in my stomach and that I didn't know about it. 'To begin with, I was very matter of fact about it all. Then within a couple of hours that changed. I saw it as a journey. This was going to be my journey.' Miss Brown, who joined Wiltshire Police 20 years ago as a special constable, underwent surgery to remove the tumour and ovary after the discovery last December. She also had a course of six chemotherapy treatments and has finally been given the all clear. 'Once you are given the all clear, the journey doesn't stop. Life never becomes normal again. You will always be someone who has had cancer,' she added. Emma Brown, pictured with her parents Steve and Jennie having her hair shaved, underwent a  course of six chemotherapy treatments and has now been given the all clear from cancer . 'I was blessed with fantastic family and friends. I have never been on my own. I have been carried through it. I know there are others who are less fortunate than me. 'My colleagues have been absolutely fantastic. I couldn't have asked for a better team. I can't put into words how brilliant they are. 'The hardest thing has probably been being off work and also having to explain to my family. I love what I do and being away from work has been really hard.' Throughout her difficult journey, Miss Brown  fundraised for others affected by cancer. Although she didn't lose her hair through her treatment, she decided to shave her hair in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. 'I was going to be having time off so I though what better opportunity would I have to do something good,' added the police officer who raised a total of £6,500.","Emma Brown, 40, had been sent to hospital with suspected appendicitis .

"Thomas Vermaelen appears set to disappoint both Barcelona and Arsene Wenger by opting to join Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. Barcelona officials have been in London this week in an attempt to lure Vermaelen from Arsenal and have tabled a more attractive financial package than United with a longer contract for the 28-year-old centre-half, who is available for £15million. Wenger has agreed to let his captain leave and restart his career having been out of the team for more than a year and will not veto a move to Old Trafford, despite admitting he would rather see him go overseas. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey: Vermaelen leaving will be a blow . Preference: Thomas Vermaelen is set to disappoint Barcelona and current club Arsenal by joining Man United . Keen to stay in England: Vermaelen is dating English model Polly Parsons . Reason to stick around: Belgian defender Vermaelen is going out with The Real Hustle star Polly Parsons . Cup of joy: Vermaelen and Polly Parsons celebrate with the FA Cup after Arsenal beat Hull in May . Former flame: Polly Parsons used to date EastEnders actor Sid Owen . Vermaelen seems set on move to Manchester. He has an English girlfriend, model Polly Parsons, and a young son, and would like to be reunited with his good friend Robin van Persie. He would also have more chance of playing regularly, which is the only factor motivating a move from the Emirates Stadium. The late interest from Barcelona may at least force United to increase their bid and help Vermaelen secure a longer contract, but the move should be complete before the Barclays Premier League starts next week. Asked on Thursday about a bid from United, Wenger smiled before he said: ‘They could be in the group.’ No veto: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has admitted Manchester United are among Vermaelen's suitors . As for the transfer, he added: ‘It could happen. He needs to play. We have sat and talked about it. He has shown an outstanding attitude and behaviour but we will not stand in his way if he finds an opportunity.’ Van Gaal wants Vermaelen to operate on the left of three centre-halves in a new-look United team and Wenger expects them to feature in a congested title race after finishing seventh last season. ‘There could be five or six this year,’ said Wenger. ‘Certainly United will come back into it.’ Vermaelen’s exit will force Wenger into the market to recruit a replacement. A defensive midfielder and a centre-half were identified as priority signings at a scouting meeting this week. Wenger is expected to start with Laurent Koscielny and teenager Calum Chambers in central defence for the FA Community Shield against Manchester City on Sunday. All smiles: New signing Calum Chambers looks set to start for Arsenal in Sunday's Community Shield . German internationals Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski are not due back until Monday, while Swiss defender Johan Djourou is close to finalising a move to Hamburg. In the past Bacary Sagna may have been moved into the centre but the right back is the latest to take the well-worn route from the Emirates to the Etihad Stadium. ‘I made him a proposal to stay for three years and he chose City,’ said Wenger. ‘It looks to me like he agreed it a long time before. It is always disappointing. Ideally I would have loved him to stay but he was super-professional until the last day of his contract and I respect that.’ Sagna has followed Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Adebayor, Gael Clichy and Samir Nasri to City but Wenger believes UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules, brought in to stop clubs spending more money than they earn, are levelling the market and will make such a move more difficult in future. Paris St Germain claimed yesterday that they had pulled out of talks to sign Angel di Maria from Real Madrid because it was too expensive, and City have spent less than Arsenal in this transfer window. ‘We are less vulnerable for sure,’ said Wenger.","Thomas Vermaelen will opt to join Manchester United over Barcelona .

"Regardless of religious beliefs, many people attempt to meditate at busy times in their lives. And now a new study claims that meditation activates parts of the brain that simple ‘relaxing’ cannot. People who meditate process more ideas and feelings than when they are just resting and letting your mind wander is more effective than concentrating on emptying your head of thoughts, scientists said. Focus: The experts discovered that letting your mind wander is more effective than concentrating on emptying your head of thoughts when meditating. The left images show the brain during concentrative meditation, while images to the right show the brain during nondirective meditation . Researchers from St Olavs Hospital in . Trondheim, Norway, believe their findings - published in the . journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience - suggest that meditation is more . than just a way to lower stress. There are countless techniques such as Zen, Buddhist and transcendental meditation and these can be divided into two main groups known as ‘concentrative’ meditation where the person focuses on breathing and specific thoughts and ‘nondirective’ which allows the mind to wander as it pleases. All the participants in the study had experience with a nondirective form of meditation practiced in Norway called Acem. Relax: Experts from St Olavs Hospital in Trondheim, Norway, used MRI scanners to look at brain activity during meditations. They found that the brain processes more thoughts and feelings during meditation than when people are simply relaxing . Scientists have shown that a mere seven hours of brain training can make humans kinder and more likely to help those in need. U.S. researchers have discovered that training people to be more compassionate actually changes their brains. Scientists at the Waisman Centre at the University of Wisconsin-Madison used compassion mediation – an ancient Buddhist technique to increase caring feelings for people who are suffering – in their experiment. People who had compassion training were compared to a control group that learned cognitive reappraisal, which is a technique where people learn to reframe their thoughts to feel less negative. The researchers then looked at whether people became more altruistic. Participants in the experiment played a game on the internet in which they were given the opportunity to spend their own money in order to help out someone in need. Lead author Helen Weng said: ‘We found that people trained in compassion were more likely to spend their own money altruistically to help someone who was treated unfairly than those who were trained in cognitive reappraisal.’ Compassion training also increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the extent to which it communicated with the nucleus accumbens, which are brain regions involved in emotion regulation and the production of positive emotions, MRI scans revealed. Compassion, like physical and academic skills, appears to be something that is not fixed, but rather can be enhanced with training and practice. Using an . MRI scanner, the experiment showed that the part of their brains . dedicated to processing self-related thoughts and feelings were more . active during the activity than at rest. When . test subjects performed concentrative meditation, the activity in this . part of the brain was almost the same as when they were just resting. Dr Jian Xu, of St Olavs, said: ‘I was surprised the activity of the brain was greatest when the person’s thoughts wandered freely on their own, rather than when the brain worked to be more strongly focused. ‘When the subjects stopped doing a specific task and were not really doing anything special, there was an increase in activity in the area of the brain where we process thoughts and feelings. ‘It is described as a kind of resting network. And it was this area that was most active during nondirective meditation.’ Professor Svend Davanger, of the University of Oslo, said: ‘The study indicates nondirective meditation allows for more room to process memories and emotions than during concentrated meditation. ‘This area of the brain has its highest activity when we rest. It represents a kind of basic operating system; a resting network that takes over when external tasks do not require our attention. ‘It is remarkable a mental task like nondirective meditation results in even higher activity in this network than regular rest.’ Professor Davanger is the only member of the research team to regularly meditate and he believes that good research depends on having a team that can combine personal experience of meditation with a critical attitude towards results. ‘Meditation is an activity practiced by millions of people. It is important we find out how this really works,’ he added.","Letting your mind wander is more effective than concentrating on emptying your head of thoughts, scientists said .

"A baby boy died from meningitis hours after he was sent home from an out-of-hours health centre with Calpol. His mother Jamie-Lee Ball says she took five-month-old Jayden-James to the clinic with a high temperature, cold hands and feet and purple spots on his neck. She said she pointed out the rash to a doctor who carried out an examination at the out-of-hours service run by Bury And Rochdale Doctors On Call (Bardoc).

But Jamie-Lee, 18, says she was then told that her son had a viral infection - and was sent home with Calpol and Ibuprofen. Within hours, Jayden-James's condition deteriorated and he was taken by ambulance to Fairfield Hospital in Bury, where he was given antibiotics. He had a heart attack and died. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) confirmed Jayden-James died from meningococcal septicaemia, blood poisoning caused by the infection. Bosses at Bardoc, the organisation which runs the out-of-hours service, have launched an investigation into the tragedy and said the care he received would be thoroughly examined. Jamie-Lee, from Radcliffe, paid tribute to her 'perfect' son but demanded answers. She said: 'He was very much loved. There were little purple spots on the back of his neck and that was the first thing that I said to the doctor at the clinic. 'The doctor said that he thought it was a viral infection but he could not give antibiotics because it had only just started that day.' Jayden-James was born in April weighing 5lb 15oz.  Jamie-Lee said: 'It was just brilliant to hold him for the first time and I felt really lucky.

"Should Liverpool have any hope of snatching the Premier League title away from Manchester City, it will require goals, goals, points, and some more goals. Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have answered that call all season – but a surprising set of statistics shows those from the England striker have proven more valuable. Crystal Palace must be beaten at Selhurst Park for Brendan Rodgers' side to maintain their challenge and for that the SAS strikeforce have to be on form. VIDEO Scroll down for Rodgers: I see Suarez and Sturridge as soloists not a pair . Deadly: Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have scored 50 goals between them in the Premier League . Just two good: The strikeforce, known as the SAS, are among the most lethal in world football . Training day: Suarez and Sturridge prepare for a must-win game at Crystal Palace on Monday night . And it is Sturridge, rather than PFA Player of the Year Suarez, who has done most to get Liverpool to this point. Suarez has scored more Premier League goals this campaign than Sturridge – 30 to 20 – and the Uruguayan also finds the net more frequently – with a goal every 92.8 minutes, compared with 105.5 minutes. But the England star's goals have engineered more points and arrived in more desperate scenarios. Five of his 20 have come when Liverpool were behind in a match, while, quite remarkably, Suarez has managed that only once. Unstoppable: The Uruguayan has been crowned PFA Player of the Year and FWA Player of the Year this season . Strike: Suarez scores his first of four goals against Norwich at Anfield in December . Lofted: Sturridge executes a delightful chip to round off a win over West Brom at Anfield . Further, when you subtract Sturridge’s goals from final scorelines it shows they have accounted for 18 points. For Suarez, that tally is 15 points. So despite playing fewer minutes (2,110 to 2,784), Sturridge has had greater impact in this aspect. Allied to this is Sturridge’s ability to perform against the division’s bigger teams. Clearly, Suarez is no slouch but the average position of teams he has scored against is 14th in the table, while for Sturridge it is 11th. Sturridge has also scored a significantly higher proportion of his goals against Liverpool’s direct rivals with 20 per cent of his total coming against teams in the top six. For Suarez, who failed to score against City, Chelsea, or Arsenal this season, that figure is 16.7 per cent. On terms: Sturridge, pictured scoring at Fulham, has been invaluable to Liverpool with his goals . Opposition: Suarez will face England when he lines up for Uruguay at the World Cup . We need goals: Brendan Rodgers knows his team need a rout or hope City drop points . Suarez is often asked to play deeper that his partner in tight games, perhaps accounting for a drop-off, and even so, he has 12 assists to Sturridge’s seven. Rodgers will not care how the goals come against Palace, he will be well aware Tony Pulis has made his side notoriously hard to break down. Trailing City by a goal difference of nine means that only a rout will give them a chance if City keep winning. These numbers show it may be Sturridge, rather than Suarez, who seizes the initiative.","Luis Suarez's goals have won a total of 15 points for Liverpool so far this season .

"Military action against Colonel Gaddafi is not working and hostilities must end urgently, according to France’s defence minister. In a startling admission, Gerard Longuet said the Libyan tyrant must be welcomed to negotiations with pro-freedom rebels because airstrikes were failing to break the deadlock. He also raised the extraordinary possibility of the dictator clinging to power in a bid to thrash out a diplomatic solution. Supporters: Crowds shout slogans in support for Muammar Gaddafi . His apparent U-turn exposed deepening cracks in the Nato-led mission and were played down on this side of the Channel. A source close to Prime Minister David Cameron insisted: ‘That is not our position.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: . ‘Time is not on Gaddafi’s side: the diplomatic, economic and military . pressure on his regime continues to build. ‘Whilst there has to be a political . solution, Gaddafi’s brutal actions have stripped him of all legitimacy . and he must go immediately.’ One military insider said: ‘It’s . dispiriting when we are trying to keep up military and diplomatic . pressure on Gaddafi and the French all of a sudden decide to sing from a . different hymn sheet.’ Coalition leaders – including Mr Cameron – have made it clear the dictator must go. Ceasefire? Opponents of the Nato bombing campaign against Libya protest in front of the White House in Washington . But despite nearly four months of bombing raids against his forces and command centres Gaddafi stubbornly remains in power. Speaking in Paris, Mr Longuet said: . ‘We must now sit around a table. We will stop bombing as soon as the . Libyans start talking to one another and the military on both sides go . back to their bases. We’ve shown there is no solution through force.’ Negotiations between Tripoli and the . National Transitional Council, the rebels’ de facto government in . Benghazi, should not be conditional on Gaddafi stepping down, he said. He added that the dictator could remain in Libya ‘in another room of the palace, with another title’. The development is significant . because France and Britain were the driving forces behind the onslaught . against Gaddafi, after the dictator vowed to exterminate rebels who . supported the uprising which began in February. Last month France admitted parachuting weapons and ammunition to the rebels. U-turn: French defence minister Gerard Longuet, left, said Gaddafi could remain in Libya  ‘in another room of the . palace, with another title' Millions of taxpayers’ money has been spent on the military mission yet Libyan forces continue to repel rebel attacks. Melissa Bell, international affairs . editor for France 24 television news network, said: ‘It was always a . question of Gaddafi leaving. The French were so gung-ho at the . beginning, and are more battle weary now and realise the military . solution is not as easy as they imagined.’ Tory MP John Baron, who voted against . the UK joining the mission, said: ‘This seems to be the longest . assassination attempt in history. The bombing of Gaddafi’s family homes . is hardly within the terms of the UN resolution. What we need is . diplomatic negotiation – more jaw jaw, less war war. ‘The French position also doesn’t easily square with the fact that they are dropping arms to the rebels.’ Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy . said: ‘Some of these comments seem to add fog to this conflict. It is . important our armed forces join allies to protect innocent civilians.’ Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi’s son and heir . apparent, claimed yesterday that Tripoli was already in talks towards a . peace settlement with France, although Paris denied ‘direct’ negotiations with the regime. Further strains are likely to surface . this week when the ‘contact group’, which brings together the countries . allied against Gaddafi, gathers in Istanbul on Friday. The Ministry of Defence said British . troops carried out successful airstrikes on Sunday. RAF jets destroyed . an armed vehicle near the vital oil town of Brega in eastern Libya and a . rocket launcher at Zlitan in the west.","Diplomacy is the answer, says defence minister in 'U-turn'

"To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years. But now, the Polish Government has launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Although the Enigma code (deciphering machine, left) was cracked by Englishman Alan Turing (right) and his team at Bletchley Park during WWII, the Poles feels their crucial contribution has been overlooked . Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw. The rest is history - but not the complete history, as far as Senator Piotr Zientarski is concerned. 'We have a duty to remind people just what the Polish cryptologists did,' he told the Daily Telegraph. The government official said that in recognition of the trio's efforts, the upper house of Poland's parliament has passed a resolution in their honour to 'restore justice'. Poland's parliament has launched a campaign so Polish cryptographers are credited for helping to crack the Nazis' Enigma code. Above, Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, where the breakthrough is said to have shortened the war by two years . The resolution reads: 'In both popular literature and official information, the public was told that the breaking of the Enigma codes was due to the work of the British Intelligence services to the complete omission of the work of Polish scientists.' The Germans, who had been using the technology since the late 1920s, believed the codes were impossible to crack. Using a complicated system of rotors, the machine would encode messages before sending them via Morse code to another machine. If the receiving machine had been programmed with the same settings - one of 158 million million million combinations - the message would be deciphered. However the team of cryptologists, linguists, scientists and data analysts at Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire, led by Londoner Turing, were able to break it. Overlooked: Kate Winslet starred in the 2001 British-produced film, Enigma, which makes little mention of the Poles' contribution . At its peak, the team was cracking 6,000 encrypted German Enigma messages every day - building on the principles set out by Rejewski, Rozycki and Zygalski. Jan Rulewski, a senator from the governing Civic Platform party, said: 'This resolution restores justice. Not only did the Western Allies marginalise the achievements of Polish cryptographers but the Soviets did the same. 'They were silent about the Polish contribution to saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of troops fighting on all fronts.' The film Enigma (made in 2001), starring Kate Winslet and set at Bletchley, has also upset the Poles - it not only downplays their contribution but also, the only Pole in the film is a traitor. The resentment adds to the wider feeling in the country that their contribution to the Allies’ victory has been under-appreciated. Polish troops fought in North Africa, Italy and Normandy, and took part in the Battle for Berlin. In the Battle of Britain, Polish pilots had the highest kill rates. Yet Polish troops - still under the command of Poland's independent government in exile - were forbidden from taking part in official VE Day celebrations due to Britain's wish to appease Stalin.

"They're seen as the easy targets during election campaigns by graffiti gangs and have often been the subject of battles between political candidates - but the defacing of election billboards or corflutes, as they are also known, is going to become a costly past-time now in New Zealand. With less than a month before the NZ election (September 20) some of the Kiwi political parties are getting all high-tech on vandals, installing hidden cameras to monitor their advertising boards. Police will be provided with the images of anyone caught on camera defacing the corflutes . Corflutes don't come cheap, just one can cost $10. The New Zealand Herald says that the National party has confirmed that some electioneering teams are already using motion sensor cameras and any act of vandalism or theft is passed onto police. If successfully prosecuted, vandals can be fined or, in the worst cases, face imprisonment. One Conservative Party member decided to act when he had his boards set alight. Another National Party politician claims more than 100 of his were destroyed in the first weeks of the campaign. It's not a problem restricted to NZ, of course. Some graffiti can be fairly basic but others go to great lengths, including going as far as transforming a conservative candidate to resemble an outrageous rock idol . All NZ parties have been targeted. This time Jacinda Ardern's billboard (of the Labour Party) is given a distinct pirate theme . In some Australian states anyone found to have made 'obscene or indecent representations' can face up to seven years in jail. During the 2012 Queensland elections, then Independent Member for Burnett Rob Messenger was targeted by vandals spraying Nazi symbols on his boards. Labor's Fowler MP, Chris Hayes, was one of those to have his signage damaged during last year's election campaign, as did his Liberal counterpart, Andrew Nguyen. Both chose not replace the damaged pieces because of the cost.","Hidden cameras have been placed around NZ election billboards to catch culprits .

"Phil Jones insists Manchester United have not given up hope of catching Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea. United's 11-match unbeaten run came to a shock end on Sunday when they lost 1-0 to Southampton at Old Trafford. The defeat meant United dropped to fourth in the table and Louis van Gaal's men are now some 12 points behind Chelsea, who are two points in front of second-placed Manchester City. Defender Phil Jones (right) insists that Manchester United are still in the title race . Manchester United's 1-0 loss to Southampton leaves them 12 points behind leaders Chelsea . United were so poor on Sunday that they failed to muster a single shot on target. United's £150million four-man attack looked blunt, but Jones believes it would be wrong to make a snap judgement on the team's title aspirations based on Sunday's defeat. When asked whether the loss meant it would be hard to catch Chelsea or City, the United defender said: 'No. You have seen teams dropping points. 'I think Chelsea were clear of City and then two games within the space of a week and they are back in it. That's how football changes. 'It's up and down. You just never know who is going to drop points. 'That gives us hope. There's always hope, but we have to worry about ourselves really rather than anyone else.' Senior sources at Old Trafford insisted towards the end of last year that United had been on an 'upward trajectory' since Van Gaal took over in July. But however much he does not like to be told about it, the Premier League table suggests otherwise. Juan Mata screams after missing one of two excellent opportunities to score for the Reds . Southampton winger Dusan Tadic stripped off to celebrate scoring his winning goal . After 21 matches Van Gaal has amassed 37 points - the same number as his predecessor David Moyes, who was sacked after 10 months having spent less than half the money his successor has on transfers. There is no doubt Van Gaal has restored a sense of grandeur and expectation about the club though. And when asked whether United were in a better position to bounce back now compared to last year, Jones added: 'Yes. There's a lot of confidence still in the dressing room. 'We have lost the game, the lads are disappointed but you have to move on quickly. 'You can't dwell on these results. We have done okay over Christmas. 'We would have liked to have picked up two more points against Stoke and Tottenham but now we need to get a bit of a run, . 'Losing is always a little setback but it's nothing more than that. 'We have to look forward to the next game and make sure we get three points. We have been on a decent run and we need to go on a new one.' Diego Costa celebrates after helping Chelsea to open up a two-point lead at the top of the table . Manchester City dropped points after being held to a 1-1 draw by Steven Naismith's strike at Everton . Many were surprised to see Radamel Falcao omitted from the United matchday squad. Van Gaal's decision to stick with the 3-4-1-2 system despite United's defensive frailties also drew criticism. Jones thinks it was always going to be hard for he and his team-mates to adapt to the new system, but the England centre-back insists he is at ease playing as part of a back three. 'I think we are comfortable playing in it,' the 22-year-old said. 'It's a learning curve. It doesn't just happen overnight. You don't just click your fingers and you are used to playing in a formation. 'It's like anything. But we are improving in training and we want to get better. 'We can have a back four or three. We are comfortable with both. Louis van Gaal's decision to omit Radamel Falcao from the squad has cast doubts over the striker's future . United reserve keeper Sam Johnstone will spend the rest of the season at Preston after a loan at Doncaster . 'Sometimes maybe we play a pass in the defence when we shouldn't but we are comfortable playing in both formations the manager has shown. 'We are still improving as a team.' United, meanwhile, have confirmed backup goalkeeper Sam Johnstone will spend the rest of the season on loan at hometown club Preston. Johnstone was on loan at Doncaster, but the 21-year-old cut short his spell at the Yorkshire club to move to Deepdale, where his father Glenn played during the 1990s.","Manchester United's unbeaten run came to an end against Southampton .

"A young Pakistani cricket player and his entire family are being kicked out of Belgium after he was labelled a terrorist for carrying his bat on public transport. A photograph of Assim Abassi, who authorities thought was armed with a weapon, was circulated by the police last week and generated a terror scare. The incident followed an attack on the Jewish museum in Brussels earlier this year. When the 22-year-old saw his picture in local newspapers he contacted police and told them that he was only armed with a cricket bat. The piece of sporting equipment wasn't easily recognisable as he was keeping it dry. Pakistani cricket player Assim Abassi and his entire family are being kicked out of Belgium after he was labelled a terrorist for carrying his bat on public transport; above is a picture police released to local media that sparked fears that a terrorist was on the loose . Mr Abassi's cricket bat can clearly be identified under his top, with the thin handle facing forward, and the top of the bat's hitting surface being visible though his jumper which he used to keep the it dry before practice . According to The Telegraph Mr Abassi said: 'I wrapped my bat in my sweatshirt because it was raining and if it is wet I can't play the ball properly.' The pictures of Abassi circulated by police led to local newspapers warning of an 'anti-Semetic killer' on the loose in Brussels.

"We'll put talk of the domestic Treble down to a little New Year’s over-excitement on behalf of Radoslaw Cierzniak. Back on planet Earth, though, this rip-roaring win for Dundee United does, unquestionably, have them very much in contention for the European spots and in decent fettle for the respective cup competitions. On the kind of night that ages managers beyond their years, Jackie McNamara watched his side somehow surrender a 2-0 lead - only for Sean Dillon to dig them out with a trademark skipper’s header. Sean Dillon celebrates after scoring Dundee United's winner in the 3-2 victory over Hamilton on Monday . Dillon jumped highest to win the ball and head home a winner for the visitors at New Douglas Park . Poor Martin Canning. In his first game as Hamilton’s caretaker boss, the home team staged the kind of comeback his predecessor Alex Neil was famed for - but it ultimately all went sour. United will awake on Tuesday to a Premiership table that sees them sitting third. Goalkeeper Cierzniak’s prediction of yet catching both Aberdeen and Celtic seems utterly fanciful but at least they are in there to ask the question. Hamilton should not be too despondent. There were bountiful signs here that normal service will be resumed despite Neil’s departure last week and, just one point shy of the magical 40 mark, they have no reason to reproach themselves. United’s commitment to promoting youth was again in evidence with McNamara drafting three teenagers - Blair Spittal, Charlie Telfer and Aidan Connolly - into his line-up. Martin Canning, Hamilton's caretaker boss, saw his side denied a point after coming back from two down . Hamilton's Ali Crawford (top) celebrates with team-mates after scoring the equaliser on Monday . Canning opted to leave himself out of his first managerial selection - Jesus Garcia Tena stepping in. Before the new man’s era got properly under way, there was a fitting farewell to the one he replaced. The timing of Neil’s departure for Norwich City meant he didn’t have the opportunity to thank those who had supported him during his time in charge and vice versa. Had he been watching on TV, though, Neil would surely have had a lump in his throat at the standing ovation those Hamilton fans afforded him in the opening minutes. Accies started the brighter of the two sides. Ali Crawford’s corner was met with by Garcia Tena’s leap and the Spaniard’s frustration at not working Cierzniak with his header was understandable. Stephen Hendrie was thankful his error didn’t meet with severe consequences. Dispossessed 35 yards from goal, there was no catching Telfer as he bounced down the line. Were it not for Mikey Devlin’s intervention, Nadir Ciftci would have netted. Stuart Armstrong gave Dundee United the lead with a shot from the edge of the area . Armstrong (second right) celebrates with his United team-mate following his early strike . Hendrie passed up a chance to redeem himself. Teed up by Tony Andreu, the full-back lashed his shot into the side netting where better options were available. Once United found their feet, the diminutive figures of Connolly and Telfer seemed to be everywhere. On one promising counter, Telfer fed his fellow teenager with a lovely pass then bolted into the box in anticipation of the favour being returned, but Connolly went for a goal from a ludicrous angle. Then a swift interchange between Gary Mackay-Steven, Armstrong and Telfer on the edge of the box resulted in the former Rangers finishing with a crisp strike that could only have been a yard wide. Accies were powerless to prevent Armstrong opening the scoring seven minutes from the interval. Dundee United's Gary Mackay-Steven (right) puts the ball past the keeper to double their advantage . Mackay-Steven runs away with his arms aloft having scored Dundee United's second at New Douglas Park . Even before Connolly’s pass arrived at his feet, there was only one thing on his mind. Having taken one touch to steady himself, his second action was to unleash an arrow of a strike more than 25 yards from goal. Canning would have reminded his team at the interval that they were only one such piece of magic away from parity provided they hung in there. That plan lasted all of 21 seconds, though. Straight from the kick-off, United doubled their lead. With Accies’ defence not so much sleeping as in a coma, Armstrong’s simple pass to Mackay-Steven put him within sight of Michael McGovern’s goal and he shot low into the net. Nadir Ciftci ought to have wrapped the game up in those moments but miscued horribly. How the Turk would regret that. Hamilton's Jesus Garcia Tena celebrates after pulling a goal back for his side on Monday night . On 57 minutes, Connolly’s attempted slide-tackle on Andreu gifted Hamilton a free-kick. Garcia Tena did the rest - a swerving left-foot strike going up and over the wall but dipping beautifully into the net. Some 13 minutes later, the hosts were level. Sent clear by Dougie Imrie, Crawford’s first attempt to beat Cierzniak was blocked by the Pole. But the Accies midfielder maintained his composure to calmly volley the rebound into the empty net. Just two minutes later, though, United were back in front. Chris Erskine’s corner was met by Dillon, who scored with a thunderous header. Canning gave himself the last two minutes as substitute but to no avail. On reflection, he might wish he’d involved himself sooner. Jesus Garcia Tena scored a spectacular free-kick to get the home side back into the match .","Dundee United beat Hamilton 3-2 at New Douglas Park on Monday .

"For someone comfortable to let the spotlight shine on others, James Milner is probably in two minds about being regarded as the new must-have accessory for all the Premier League's top clubs. But he can't avoid the truth any longer. Having just celebrated his 29th birthday with two FA Cup goals against Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend, Milner's stock has never been higher. He is one of the stars of the season. Manchester City, with all their injury problems and squad restrictions, couldn't have done without him this season. Rivals like Arsenal and Liverpool covet him. And as his contract at the Etihad runs into the final six months, Milner's bargaining position has never been stronger. Manchester City midfielder James Milner has yet to sign a new deal to stay with the reigning champions . Milner has been called many things in his career since scoring his first Premier League goal for Leeds United at 16. He's versatile, having played at full back, holding midfield, right wing, left wing, No 10 and now striker following injuries to Sergio Aguero, Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko. Once seen as a weakness - 'Jack of all trades, master of none' - it is now a strength. He's also been mocked for being 'boring', even poking fun at himself for his image. All because he is teetotal and prefers to play golf rather than be photographed in celebrity hang-outs on his days off. Milner has attracted interest from Liverpool with his contract running out at the end of the season . The England international pictured celebrating his 17th birthday with former Leeds manager Terry Venables . Milner, who left Leeds in 2004, holds up a cake on his 17th birthday with former manager Terry Venables . Here's the breakdown of James Milner's host of positions playing for Manchester City in 27 appearances in all competitions this season: . Midfield (right) - 5 . Midfield (left) - 5 . Forward/striker - 4 . Attacking midfield (left) - 2 . Midfield (centre) - 1 . Substitute appearances - 10 . But if these are flaws, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers are two of countless managers prepared to accept them. They would prefer their players to be boring rather than getting into controversy through boozing, smoking or problematic exchanges on social media. They also know in an era where clubs are restricted to 25 players in their Premier League squad (and 21 for City in the Champions League this season due to FPP penalties) Milner is even more valuable because he is five players in one. Milner is in an incredibly strong position as he prepares to enter his 30s. Manchester City have recently played Milner as a striker, seen here against Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday . The 29-year-old in action against Manchester United for Newcastle, where he played from 2004-2008 . In the Champions League against Roma Milner was deployed wide left in an attacking role . During the 3-2 win against Sunderland in the Premier League Milner played wide left again for City . Milner enjoyed a successful loan spell at Aston Villa before joining in 2008 for two seasons . The 29-year-old played wide right in the City midfield against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup . He has shown before at Leeds United, Newcastle United and Aston Villa that he is strong enough to end up with what he wants and while very happy in the environment at City, he will seek assurances from Pellegrini about the amount of matches he will play next season before committing himself to a new deal. Milner has helped out his manager this season when others have been unable to play but the memory of being left out of last season's Capital One Cup final at Wembley runs deep. Having spent £25million on Adam Lallana last summer, the prospect of landing Milner for nothing will be mouthwatering for Liverpool boss Rodgers and the club's moneyball owners. After Luis Suarez and Mario Balotelli, he would be easy for the club's overworked PR department too. City manager Manuel Pellegrini put Milner in central midfield to face Bayern Munich in the Champions League . Manchester City remain confident that Milner, scoring against Sheffield Wednesday, will sign a new deal . Arsene Wenger would see Milner as a positive influence on his young English players Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and others. On the pitch, he would give 100 per cent effort, has match intelligence and knows how to distribute the ball to keep attacking momentum. Even Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford will be wondering if politically he can sign a former Manchester City player. United have also had severe injury problems this season and Milner is the type you want in the squad when that happens. The problem will be persuading City to let their asset leave early. Their £30m pursuit of Wilfried Bony does mean sacrifices will have to be made elsewhere in their squad to fit in with FPP restrictions. Milner runs over to the Manchester City fans and celebrates after scoring twice on Sunday in the FA Cup . Getting £5m now for Milner would be one option but it's hard to think that would make sense from Pellegrini's point of view given the player's form and importance to the dressing room. He is also one of the five association-trained players City need to fill their quota in their Champions League squad and you know the boss would rather have Milner there than Scott Sinclair, for example. When Aguero (knee) and Edin Dzeko (calf) left City bereft of a centre-forward at the start of  December, there were plenty of doom-and-gloom merchants who thought their challenge was over at home and abroad. Instead, Pellegrini asked Milner to play up front, and the way he created space for the likes of David Silva and Samir Nasri meant the good results continued. City are now unbeaten in 12 games, joint top of the Premier League and have Barcelona next up in Europe. Life is anything but dull and for those clubs who want Milner, they face a wait of at least six months.","James Milner's contract at Manchester City runs out in the summer .

"Southampton climbed to third in the Premier League on Sunday night after beating Manchester United at Old Trafford as Ronald Koeman's side continues to defy the odds in their chase for Champions League football. The Dutchman has rightly taken the plaudits for exceeding all expectations after the club made wholesale in the summer. But who makes up Koeman's backroom staff? Here, Sportsmail gives you the low-down on the men working miracles behind the scenes at St Mary's. Southapton's first team staff (left to right) Sammy Lee, Martin Hunter, Erwin Koeman, Dave Watson, Ronald Koeman and Jan Kluitenberg pose for a picture at the beginning of the season . ERWIN KOEMAN . Role: Assistant manager . Erwin Koeman is the older brother of manager Ronald and the pair teamed up in the summer to take charge of Southampton after managing against each other in the Dutch league. Erwin managed RKC Waalwijk for two seasons - where he locked horns with Ronald, who was manager of Feyenoord - before joining his brother at St Mary's after leading the club to relegation last season. It is the first time the brothers have coached together and Erwin said his late father Martin, who died in 2013, would have been pleased: 'We once said we would be good to work together, but my father also said it would be fantastic if we could be a duo. Unfortunately he won't experience it but I am sure he would really like it.' Erwin, like Ronald, began his playing career at Groningen - the brothers spent one season together at the Dutch side in 1982-83 - before representing PSV and KV Mechelen in Belgium. Erwin also lined up alongside his brother for Holland. The Southampton assistant earned 31 caps for the national side and was part of the team that won the 1988 European Championships. Erwin Koeman is a former manager in the Dutch league and teamed up with brother Ronald at Southampton to coach together for the first time . Erwin and Ronald take their seats for Southampton's Premier League clash with Manchester City in November . JAN KLUITENBERG . Role: First team coach . Jan Kluitenberg followed Koeman to Southampton in the summer after working under him at Feyenoord. The duo also enjoyed spells together at AZ Alkmaar and Benfica. Kluitenberg's role at Southampton is to  ensure the players reach peak physical fitness and is responsible for devising individual training programmes to ensure maximum physical output and prevention of injuries. Having worked with him at three previous clubs, Koeman clearly has trust in Kluitenberg's methods and after Sunday's 1-0 win at Old Trafford, where Saints produced a perfectly executed high pressing performance, it would be hard to argue with his techniques. Jan Kluitenberg has worked with Koeman at three other clubs including Feynoord and AZ Alkmaar . SAMMY LEE . Role: First team assistant coach . Sammy Lee spent 12 years as a Liverpool player in the 1970s and 80s winning three consecutive league titles and three European Cups during a golden era for the club. Lee began his coaching career at the Merseyside club, too, where he spent another 11 years at Liverpool working under Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier before moving on after the appointment of Rafa Benitez. Lee then moved to Bolton and became Sam Allardyce's assistant - where he was affectionately known as 'Little Sam' - and even enjoyed a short spell in charge of the north-west club. The 58-year-old also coached England for five years during Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign between 2001 and 2006, before further spells at Liverpool and Bolton. Lee left his role as head of academy coaching at Wanderers to link up with Koeman at Southampton, with the club hoping to tap into more than 20 years of coaching experience. Sammy Lee won three league titles and three European Cups as a player at Liverpool . MARTIN HUNTER . Role: Technical director: . Martin Hunter began his career as a PE and Geography teacher at Bridgewater Hall School in Milton Keynes, before working as assistant manager at Bradford and Stoke. Hunter then spent 13 years as a coach at the FA, where he worked with England Under 15s, Under 16s and Under 19s and helped bring through the likes of Joe Cole, Theo Walcott and Michael Carrick into the senior team. Hunter went on to work at Norwich and Watford - where he played an active role alongside Malky Mackay - before returning to Bradford for a short spell in 2010. He then moved to Southampton in July 2010 as under 21 coach before moving into his role as technical director, where he has played a key role in bringing through players from the youth academy. In a recent interview with the Telegraph Hunter described the 'Southampton way': 'We tell the coaches we want three things in the session: we want players coming off sweating with a smile on their faces and to have learned something.' Assistant first team coach Lee issues instructions from the touchline . DAVE WATSON . Role: Senior goalkeeping coach . Dave Watson made more than 200 appearances for his hometown club Barnsley before his playing career was curtailed by a serious knee injury that he wasn't able to recover from. Watson hung up his gloves in 2001 at just 28 before embarking on a coaching career that began at Northampton and took him to Oldham and Huddersfield. Watson then worked with the England Under 19s, where he enhanced his reputation after assisting in the development of Joe Hart, Ben Foster and Jack Butland at international level. His work didn't go unnoticed ans Watson was invited by senior manager Roy Hodgson to work alongside Ray Clemence at Euro 2012, before taking up a role at Norwich. Leaving Norwich after their  relegation to the Championship last season, Watson joined the staff at Southampton and has helped Fraser Forster make the seamless transition to Premier League football. Goalkeeping coach Dave Watson and Koeman get their point across to the players . PS LES REED . Role: Executive director . Les Reed began his career as a coach in non-League before spending time coaching in the FA becoming director of technical development, overseeing the development of Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. But Reed is most famous for a disastrous spell in charge of Charlton Athletic after taking over from Iain Dowie in November, 2006. Reed lasted in the job just six weeks, managing one victory and suffered the embarrassment of being knocked out of the League Cup by League Two side Wycombe. The ill-fated reign led to Reed being attacked in the media and he developed the unwanted nickname 'Les Miserables'. He left by mutual consent in December. Reed joined Southampton in 2010 as head of football development and was in charge of overseeing the youth academy, scouting and recruitment, sports medicine and science, and kit and equipment management.","Southampton moved up to third with their 1-0 win at Old Trafford .

"Senior supporters of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez have hit out at his enemies calling on them to 'stop dreaming' of his death. They insist he is fine and will return to Venezuela when he is ready despite reports last night he was in a critical condition in a Cuban hospital. His government has accused his opponents of 'rubbing their hands together' in glee. Here's looking at you comrade: Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez (C) poses with former Cuban president Fidel Castro (L) and his brother and current leader Raul Castro during a visit to Chavez in Havana's hospital . On Saturday, Vice Foreign Minister Temir Porras tweeted that the President was recovering well from his surgery and wrote: 'His enemies should stop dreaming and his friends . should stop worrying.' He also dismissed reports that the president was critically ill. Vice President Elias Jaua said Chavez would return soon. 'The national and international . right-wing are going crazy, rubbing their hands together ... even . talking about the death of the president,' he said in a speech, adding . that Chavez's rivals were exposing themselves as anti-democratic . fascists. 'They know they cannot win elections against our comandante,' Jaua said. The revolutionary . socialist leader, who was last seen in public on June 9, is said to be receiving treatment for a pelvic abscess. On June 12, the president completed a phone call with Venezuelan state television, . and said medical tests showed no sign of any 'malignant' illness. But according to a report in El Nuevo Herald, Mr Chávez is in 'critical condition, not grave, but critical, in a complicated situation', according to unnamed U.S. intelligence officials. Healthy debate: Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro find the energy for discussion at the hospital in Havana, Cuba last week . In Venezuela there is speculation that the president is actually suffering from prostate cancer. Intelligence officials could not confirm a diagnosis of prostate cancer but Mr Chávez's family did go to Cuba in the last 72 hours. His daughter Rosinés and his mother Marisabel Rodríguez urgently left the country and headed to Cuba in a Venezuelan air force plane. The government has treated the president’s departure as a state secret, providing few details about his condition. The uncertainty over the president's health has led to the first talks of succession - in his 12 years in power no one successor has ever emerged. Mr Chávez's bother, Adan Chávez, who is a state governor, told state television that he was recovering well. He said: 'In response to all the rumours, I can give faith that the president is recovering in a satisfactory manner,"" Adan Chávez, who is a state governor, told state television Wednesday. ""The president is a strong man.' Adan Chávez added that 'it's not clear' when his younger brother would return home, but said the president is expected to leave Cuba within 10 to 12 days. Possibly to stave off rumours of bad health, Chávez personal Twitter account went active on Friday, for the first time in 20 days. 'I'm here with you during the hard battles every day! Until victory always! We are winning! And we shall win!' he tweeted. Last week he posed between two other socialist heavyweights - Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. The Venezuelan leader looked robust in his shiny tracksuit in his national  colours while former Cuban president Fidel Castro appeared dishevelled in similar leisurewear. The government originally said he would . return 'in a few days', but as time has gone by and Chavez has remained . in Cuba, rumours have circulated in Venezuela that the 56-year-old . former soldier may be seriously ill. However one Chavez ally, General Carlos Mata Figueroa told state television: 'He's getting better, stronger than ever.' His . absence has highlighted Chavez's total dominance of Venezuelan politics . - not to mention the airwaves - and the lack of an obvious successor. Latin . News, a think-tank based in the UK, said: 'His senior ministers look . dull and slightly hapless in his absence, underling his unique political . charisma.'",Venezuelan President's health sparks succession talks .

"Preparations for the inaugural day-night cricket Test will kick up a notch on Sunday, when the Nine Network runs a series of pink-ball tests at the MCG. Australia's next home Test series is against New Zealand starting in November, when the two governing bodies want to shed new light on the sport's oldest format. Details of the innovative Test are yet to be confirmed, but the colour of the ball will switch from red to pink in an unprecedented change for both players and broadcasters. Cricket Australia and Channel Nine have organised to test the new pink ball during Sunday's ODI between Australia and India. This pink ball was used in a Sheffield Shield match between WA and NSW in March 2014 . Cricket Australia and Nine have arranged a pink-ball trial to take place before play, after play and during the innings break of Sunday's one-day international against India at the MCG in Melbourne, Victoria . Cricket Australia and Nine have arranged a pink-ball trial to take place before play, after play and during the innings break of Sunday's one-day international against India in Melbourne, Victoria. A new ball, 40-over ball and 80-over ball will be used. 'To make sure from Nine's perspective that everything shapes up well ... to see how the ball comes up for a TV viewer,' CA chief executive James Sutherland told AAP. 'They're the sort of things that indicate we're well advanced with our thinking.' The ball has been the biggest stumbling block for the concept, which Sutherland hopes will 'help support and sustain the existence of Test cricket'. Initial feedback was poor, but this season's Sheffield Shield trial was considered more successful. CA is continuing to work with manufacturer Kookaburra and Sutherland is confident the change in colour won't affect the contest. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland (pictured) says the intention of the exercise is to test if there is sufficient visibility for the viewer at home when the pink ball is used, both in daylight and in the dark . The pink cricket ball was tested in place of the red ball during several Sheffield Shield matches in 2014 with varying success . 'I've seen the balls used this season, how they've come back after being used,' he said. 'Outside the colour, there's no difference to how the ball wears, the hardness and all of that. 'Anyone that is claiming anything different there, they're certainly not looking at the balls for like-for-like comparisons. 'There's increasing confidence that we'll have something to show and something to confirm before halfway through this year.' The Australian Cricketers' Association surveyed players following this season's Shield trial and is working through the results. 'We'll continue to provide feedback to both CA and Kookaburra as part of this process,' ACA boss Alistair Nicholson said. Both Australia and New Zealand will be afforded some pink-ball match practice before the Test, which is likely to be preceded by a day-night Shield round. Both Australia and New Zealand will be afforded some pink-ball match practice before the Test, which is likely to be preceded by a day-night Shield round . 'We will provide all of our players and New Zealand players with warm-up matches under lights,' Sutherland said. 'We'll be looking to schedule one or more tour games at night, depending on what New Zealand requests.' Sutherland is hoping the later start will lift both attendance figures and TV ratings. 'We don't see it just as an Australian initiative, we're trying to take a leadership position ... for more people around the world to attend and watch Test cricket,' he said. The experimental nature of the contest will attract a lot of interest, but the standard of cricket should help too. The Black Caps have been rising up the ICC's rankings recently, with their most recent Test series loss coming in 2013. 'It shapes as a pretty interesting series. Their form is outstanding,' Sutherland said.

"Intelligence agency GCHQ is able to spy on Facebook and Youtube users and can manipulate online polls, according to the latest documents allegedly leaked by fugitive CIA worker Edward Snowden. Documents thought to have been provided by the whistleblower allegedly show that the Cheltenham-based agency has developed a set of software programmes designed to breach users' computers and manipulate the internet. Among the listed tools are ones capable of searching for private Facebook photographs, sending fake text messages, changing the outcome of online polls, censoring 'extremist' material, and collating comments on Youtube and Twitter. Spying tools: Intelligence agency GCHQ is able to spy on Facebook and Youtube users and can manipulate online polls, according to the latest documents allegedly leaked by fugitive CIA worker Edward Snowden (pictured) Some of the software enables the psychological manipulation of internet users, not unlike the controversial secret study recently undertaken with the approval of Facebook, in which the social network altered people's newsfeeds to see if it had an effect on their emotions. The list of programmes was revealed in a Wikipedia-style document allegedly compiled by GCHQ's Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group . (JTRIG), which was first published by The Intercept. The tools, which have each been given codenames such as Birdsong, Angry Pirate, and Scrapheap Challenge are described as being part of the agency's 'weaponised capability'. The list, apparently compiled in 2012, . also notes whether a tool is operational, or in the design, pilot or . implementation stages, although the document states that most of them are 'fully . operational, tested and reliable'. It states: 'Don't treat this like a . catalogue. If you don't see it here, it doesn't mean we can't build it. Headquarters: According to leaked documents, Cheltenham-based agency GCHQ (pictured) has developed a set of software programmes designed to breach users' computers and manipulate the internet . 'If you involve the JTRIG operational teams at the start of your operation, you have more of a chance that we will build something for you. 'For each of our tools we have indicated the state of the tool. We only advertise tools here that are either ready to fire or very close to being ready (operational requirements would re-prioritise our development).' GCHQ had not responded to a MailOnline request for comment at the time of publication. Publication of the list comes as Snowden criticised Britain for introducing the new surveillance Bil, which was pushed through Parliament today and designed to foil terrorist plots, during peace time. Snowden, 31, who has become one of the world’s most wanted men, said the measures to allow the security services and police to monitor the public’s phone, email and internet records ‘defied belief’. ‘We don’t have bombs falling. We don’t have U-boats in the harbour,' he told the Guardian newspaper. Snowden is wanted for treason after stealing classified documents from the US National Security Agency, and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. Most wanted: Edward Snowden, 31,  is wanted for treason after stealing classified documents from the US National Security Agency, and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia . The defence contractor, a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, has previously leaked highly damaging revelations of attempts by state spy agencies – including Britain’s GCHQ and MI5 – to monitor citizens’ private information. After he revealed how intelligence agents had access to data compiled by the likes of Google and Yahoo, some of the internet giants – under pressure from civil liberties groups – became reluctant to co-operate with the Government and say they may withhold crucial intelligence. David Cameron insisted last week that new snooping laws were urgently needed because Snowden had compromised the ability of the spy agencies to keep track of dangerous extremists. Earlier this week Government lawyers admitted that GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 . do intercept private communications such as phone calls and emails by . innocent people in order to target terrorist suspects.

The troubled star kept a carrier bag hidden as he emerged from a branch of Oddbins in Poole, Dorset .

"The unsolicited message send out by Optical Express offering surgeries as prizes . A High Street optician being sued over failed operations bombarded the public with spam text messages telling them they could win free eye surgery, it emerged last night. Thousands of people complained about unsolicited messages from Optical Express dangling the prospect they had won a monthly prize draw for eye surgery worth more than £5,000. Campaigners for better regulation of the eye surgery industry accused the firm of promoting a complicated medical procedure ‘like a free holiday’. The firm has now been warned by the privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner, not to send out more spam messages or it will face criminal prosecution. Optical Express said it would appeal the ruling. The Glasgow-based company, which is the UK’s leading commercial eye surgery provider, is already facing legal action from dozens of patients amid safety fears over a type of replacement lens it uses. Yesterday the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) issued an enforcement notice against the firm requiring it to stop sending spam messages or be hauled before the courts. Nearly 5,000 people complained about Optical Express in just seven months between September 2013 and April last year, saying they had received messages without giving the company permission. The watchdog estimates it receives one complaint for every 1,000 spam texts sent – meaning the firm may have sent mil-lions of texts in total. Typical messages, seen by the Mail, said: ‘OPTICAL EXPRESS: Are you the September Laser Eye Surgery winner? Reply YES to enter our free prize draw. Prize worth up to £5,390.’ Sasha Rodoy, 61, who has been campaigning for better regulation of the corrective surgery industry since her eyesight was damaged in an eye procedure by a different high street firm four years ago, said even she had recently received one of the Optical Express spam messages. ‘I have no idea how they got my number,’ the former fashion company owner said. ‘There’s no way I gave my number to them. In the dark: High Street optician Optical Express is being sued over failed eye surgeries . ‘Offering eye surgery as a prize as if it were a free holiday should simply be banned. ‘These are complicated medical procedures that should not be taken lightly. ‘People who would never usually consider having eye surgery are being tempted into it. And if you say no, they hassle you and hassle you and do not let go.’ Andy Curry, Enforcement Group Manager at the ICO said: ‘Thousands of people who had not signed up for marketing services received these nuisance messages. ‘We have issued this enforcement notice as a warning to the company that using people’s data without their consent is not acceptable. Any breach of the notice would be a criminal of-fence.’ Patients, surgeons and politicians have been calling for far greater regulation of corrective eye surgery sold on the high street. They say heavy marketing, sales targets and lax regulation have created an environment in which people are often sold unsuitable medical procedures. Charlie Jackson, 46, who is suing Optical Express over claims of a botched operation, accused the firm of pushing procedures on patients in order to drive up sales. Mr Jackson, who runs a recruitment consultancy in Henley-on-Thames, said a corrective operation in August had given him fuzzy vision and terrible eyesight at night. ‘The major issue is the way they sell these operations,’ he told the Mail. ‘Heavy marketing and spam messages are all part of it - medical procedures should not be sold in this way. ‘Sales and healthcare do not go together. And offering laser eye surgery as a prize in a competition is just ridiculous. It is not right.’ The Medical Health Regulatory Authority is investigating concerns over the Mplus X lens which was used by Optical Express on an estimated 6,500 British patients over the last year. Leading eye surgeons at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London raised concerns over the lens, which is used in a procedure called refractive lens exchange, usually to fix minor eyesight problems. The artificial lens is designed to correct weakness of vision after it is implanted into the eye. More than 100 patients have also joined a class action law suit against Optical Express, claiming their eyesight rapidly deteriorated after receiving implants. Both firms deny there are any problems with the lens. A spokesman from Optical Express said: ‘We are aware of the decision taken by the ICO. We will be lodging an appeal.’","Optician chain Optical Express is being sued over failed eye surgeries .

Now it appears his best hope of returning to the game appears to be having his conviction overturned. This could take more than a year to get to the Court of Appeal and will mean Evans will not have played a professional game for four years. Because he is still on licence Evans is also barred from leaving Britain for extended periods, which has led him to put his wedding plans on hold, the Sun reported. Evans was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in Rhyl in north wast Wales in 2011. He has continued to maintain his innocence. Once he was released from prison Evans launched a website funded by the father of his fiancee Natasha Massey, to clear his name and applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in a bid to get his case heard by the Court of Appeal. After the 26-year-old was released from prison an opportunity to return to his former club, Sheffield United, was withdrawn when several sponsors threatened to pull out of the club. Patrons including Charlie Webster also stepped down and Olympic champion Jessica Ennis said she would request her name be removed from a stand at the Bramall Lane stadium if Evans was re-signed. This led to Mrs Ennis-Hill being threatened with rape on Twitter. The threats came weeks after Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan’s daughter, Chloe, was threatened with rape over the issue after Finningan said live on television that Evans should be allowed to return to football. Last week Oldham Athletic also confirmed it would not be offering the player a contract after a board member was told his daughter would be raped if the 26-year-old was allowed to play for the team. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said he believed it would now be ‘very difficult’ for a club to sign the player while his rape conviction stood. Evans has been supported by his fiancee Natasha Massey in his bid to overturn his conviction for rape . It is expected to take months for the Criminal Cases Review Commission to decide whether the Evans case should go to the Court of Appeal, the Observer reported. On average this takes around 38 weeks, and decisions on whether to quash an appeal can take as long as six months. Ched Evans previously played for Sheffield United but has so far failed to secure a contract at another club . The former footballer will also have problems getting signed by a club overseas because he is still on licence after being sentenced for five years in prison for rape. This effectively bars him from working abroad and means he is unable to leave the country for extended periods. This has led him to put his wedding plans to Natasha Massey on hold so the pair can go on honeymoon abroad. Evans has been criticised for his lack of remorse since he left prison and last week issued a carefully crafted statement apologising for the 'effect that night in Rhyl' had on the woman concerned. Some have questioned his rape conviction, saying they believe he does have a case for the Court of Appeal. These include commentator Rod Liddle who said there were 'grave doubts' about his conviction.","Ched Evans was convicted of raping a drunk woman in Rhyl, Wales in 2011 .

"Manchester City’s reputation at home and abroad is in tatters after it emerged they have been responsible for a trail of misinformation and confusion over their signing of Frank Lampard. City are already fighting to keep the American public onside after their decision to retain Lampard’s services for the second half of the Barclays Premier League season, rather than release him to play in MLS for feeder club New York City FC as planned. The club’s image took a further pounding after they were forced to admit they had unintentionally misled the public on both sides of the Atlantic from the moment it was announced Lampard had ‘signed’ for NYCFC on a two-year deal last summer. Manchester City have admitted that they have misled fans and New York City over Frank Lampard . City had wrongly claimed that Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move . PL apps: 3 starts (12 sub apps) Goals: 5 . FA Cup: 1 Goals: 0 . League Cup: 1 Goals: 2 . Champions League: 1 (1) Goals: 0 . TOTAL APPS: 6 (13) TOTAL GOALS: 7 . That, was not true. Nor was the subsequent announcement that the 36-year-old had joined City on a ‘loan’ until the end of the calendar year. The truth, admitted by City, is that Lampard put his name only to a pre-contract agreement with NYCFC, stipulating that he would join them on January 1. The only binding contract he signed was with City, one that saw him contracted to the club for one season with a ‘break clause’ inserted that would enable him to head to New York for MLS pre-season in January if deemed convenient. We know now that City, quite legally, removed that clause on New Year’s Eve in order to keep him until the end of the season. Under pressure from the media and unhappy fans in America, City finally admitted some of this on Friday only to then find themselves in trouble with the Premier League. Lampard is mobbed by Spanish team-mates Jesus Navas and David Silva after scoring against Sunderland . The former Chelsea man is pictured in action during City's Premier League clash with Sunderland . The whole affair has left supporters on both sides of the Atlantic angry and confused, click here to read Sportsmail's six questions that must be answered. In releasing five points of clarification Friday lunchtime, City admitted making ‘mistakes’ and ‘errors’ in their initial announcements regarding Lampard. However, the Premier League were furious to see City claiming that Lampard’s contract with them had only been until December 31 and that there had been no break clause. Instead, City claimed, Lampard had merely signed a second short-term contract with them on December 31. This angered Premier League officials as not only was it not true, it would also have been in direct contravention of Rule T11 that stipulates no player contract can be for less than 12 months. After contact from the League Friday, City backed down and privately conceded that Lampard’s contract had been for the whole season. But they have not broken any rules throughout and will not face any punishment. But Friday the headline in the influential New York Post labelled the whole Lampard situation as a ‘fraud’. Even though representatives from NYCFC are due to meet disgruntled fans for talks today, it seems all goodwill in MLS has already been lost. Over here, City face searching questions about why the whole saga has been characterised by untruth and misinformation from the start. City’s stance Friday was that the initial announcements — in New York and Manchester — were simple mistakes. Lampard's deal to join New York City will now begin in the summer after he completes the season with City . The midfielder (right) released a statement on his Facebook page on Friday denying that he misled MLS fans . There is no direct proof to the contrary but it seems incredible that a club of City’s size — with an ever expanding communications team — could make such an error, given that announcements about Lampard’s ‘signing’ were followed up by tweets and other social media news flashes essentially carrying the same message. One school of thought, popular in America, is that it was in City and NYCFC’s best interests to announce Lampard’s ‘signing’ to help season-ticket sales along in the US. City deny this and say the announcement was just an error. It would perhaps not have had the same effect had it been revealed that he had actually signed for City with a clause meaning he ‘may’ come to New York in January. That is all speculative and suggestions that Lampard never intended to switch to New York this month are quite wrong. It is only Lampard’s impressive form on the field that has seen him retained. He has simply proved more valuable to manager Manuel Pellegrini than anybody ever imagined he would. I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days. When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYC FC for two years starting January 1 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York. This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYC FC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone. I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible. Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015! Lampard holds up a New York City FC scarf after 'joining' the MLS club at the end of last season . Lampard has scored seven goals since joining City to help them draw level with his former club Chelsea . Calls made to Lampard’s representatives to ask why a former England captain allowed himself to be part of something that has subsequently turned out to be misleading were also not returned. Earlier on, however, Lampard did issue a statement designed to ‘clear up’ any confusion.

"Harry Redknapp has backed owner Tony Fernandes' decision to restrict the QPR manager to loan signings in the January transfer window. Redknapp praised QPR chairman Fernandes' approach and warned that flashing the cash would not guarantee Premier League survival. The former Tottenham boss said Fernandes has already ploughed considerable funds into QPR, and will not countenance a repeat of the financial fallout from the club's 2013 Premier League relegation. Harry Redknapp has no problem with only being allowed to sign players on loan in January . Redknapp insists that owner Tony Fernandes (right) has already invested enough money in the club . Redknapp expects to add one more loan striker to the signature of West Ham forward Mauro Zarate this month, and is not fazed by his inability to secure big-money recruits. 'I knew things were tight so it is no surprise,' said Redknapp on his chairman's frugal policy. 'We hold 18,000 people (at Loftus Road) so what can you do? You can't keep ask people to throw money in; they did their dough a few years ago. 'I understand the situation. It is good. 'We've got to be careful haven't we? I think we will stay up but if the worst comes to the worst you don't want to leave a situation where you are stuck with a load of players that you can't shift. 'I had to get rid of 15 the other year and we had to pay half of them up to go.' West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has joined QPR on loan until the end of the season . Rangers face fellow strugglers Burnley at the weekend after beating them 2-0 back in December . Rangers face Burnley at Turf Moor in a crucial Premier League clash on Saturday, with Redknapp claiming a flurry of January signings is not always the answer. 'You can spend money and still not make a difference, it depends,' he said. 'It won't suddenly keep teams up, who knows? The bottom eight are the bottom eight anyway. 'There's seven or eight teams down there and the bottom three will come out of them. 'The teams above that will be too strong. Let's see who gets the best out of the players. 'If I can get a loan or two in now who can make a difference then I'll be delighted.' Redknapp admits he has 'no idea' whether Adel Taarabt will still be a QPR player in February. Boss Redknapp claims he still wants unsettled playmaker Taarabt to make a success of his time at Loftus Road, despite the pair's public spat in October. Redknapp labelled Taarabt 'three stone overweight' in an extraordinary rant after QPR's 3-2 home defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League. Adel Taarabt's future at Loftus Road remains uncertain after a public spat with Harry Redknapp . The QPR playmaker shows off his midriff after Redknapp's claims that he was 'three stone overweight' Taarabt posed for pictures to disprove Redknapp's claims, before chairman Fernandes ordered both to call a truce. Taarabt has still featured just once for QPR this term, owing to a string of injuries, and Redknapp is still unsure on the Morocco forward's future at the club. 'No idea,' said Redknapp when asked if Taarabt would still be at QPR next month. 'If he is fit to play, wants to train and wants to play, then not a problem. 'Only Adel wants to help Adel. If he wants to get fit and wants to play then he can have all the ability in the world. He has to start producing.'","Owner Tony Fernandes has restricted QPR from signing players in January .

"Shola Ameobi will not be re-signing for Newcastle United and will instead try to follow Steven Gerrard to the MLS. The former Magpies striker - who quit Turkish side Gaziantep last week - has been at the club’s training ground over the past few days receiving treatment on an ankle injury. That led to speculation that he could be joining United on a deal until the end of the season. Shola Ameobi will not be making a return to Newcastle United and may move to Major League Soccer . Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver allowed Ameobi to return and receive treatment on an injury . Ameobi left Turkish club Gaziantep last week and is considering a move to the States .

"Thousands of older homeowners are being refused better mortgage deals because of a ‘computer says no’ attitude from lenders. Even those in their 50s are struggling to obtain home loans as an unintended consequence of tougher lending rules, a financial watchdog claims. This has resulted in ‘mortgage prisoners’ who are stuck on their lenders’ default interest rate after failing to secure a cheaper fixed rate deal. Shut out: Older homeowners are being refused better mortgage deals because of a ‘computer says no’ attitude . The Financial Conduct Authority is accusing lenders of misinterpreting its new rules and defying ‘common sense’. It said pensions were often a ‘very stable’ income and the industry must not use age as an ‘automatic bar’ to a mortgage. The watchdog said it would be ‘looking much more closely’ at claims that lenders have applied the new rules – known as the Mortgage Market Review and introduced in April – too harshly. Banks and building societies say they are simply trying to stick to the stricter regulations. These require more stringent checks on applicants’ current and future income and spending to ensure they can afford repayments if interest rates rise. But critics say banks have gone too far and accuse them of refusing loans to people approaching retirement for their own financial gain by leaving them on rates that are often less favourable. An official with the mortgage watchdog knew of cases where customers were turned down even when the switch would mean lower repayments . Most banks set an upper age limit beyond which they will not lend, typically between 65 and 80. Yet people in their 50s are also reportedly being refused because they would still be paying a mortgage in retirement. At a conference hosted by the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday, Linda Woodall of the FCA said age should not be an automatic bar. ‘There have been reports that older borrowers are finding it more difficult to get a mortgage and that this is partly down to our rules,’ she said. ‘But our rules do not aim to discourage lending to older consumers. Affordability is key. In fact the income of older borrowers such as pension income can be very stable.’ She said the FCA wanted to avoid a ‘computer says no’ attitude to lending, adding: ‘A sensible and proportionate approach is all we are asking of you’. Mrs Woodall said even homeowners wanting to downsize or reduce their debt had been refused. She knew of cases where customers had been turned down ‘on the grounds that the new loan is not affordable’ even when the switch would mean lower monthly repayments. She ordered banks to ‘look more closely at their interpretation of the rules’. Mortgage broker Andrew Montlake, of Coreco Group, told of how banks were refusing new deals for homeowners in their 50s when they have reached the end of their mortgage term. ‘The banks are nervous,’ he said. ‘Whenever there is a regulatory change, there is always a tendency to rush to the harsh end of the scale.’ But broker Ray Boulger, of John Charcol, said recent pension reforms that allow customers to draw out all or part of their pension pot had made it much more difficult for lenders to estimate borrowers’ retirement income. A spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: ‘Lending to older borrowers whose mortgages plan to extend into retirement may sometimes be perfectly appropriate. ‘However, it has become more difficult for lenders to be sure that, at some future point, regulators will be satisfied that their lending was unequivocally appropriate at the time.’","Tougher lending rules are making it difficult for over-50s to refinance .

"Elizabeth Thomas, 17, was murdered by her boyfriend in Oxted, Surrey . A teenage boy admitted stabbing his 17-year-old girlfriend to death at his home when he appeared before a judge today. Steven Miles pleaded guilty to the murder of Elizabeth Thomas and will be sentenced next month. Miss Thomas's body was discovered at the Miles's family's flat in Oxted, Surrey, shortly before 5pm on Friday January 24. A post-mortem examination revealed that she had died from a stab wound. Miles, aged 17, was arrested on suspicion of murder and detained under the Mental Health Act the same day. At the time of her death, friends claimed that Miss Thomas had wanted to end her relationship with Miles, then 16. She had just recently joined Oxted School sixth form, where Miles also studied, and lived in West Wickham. At Guildford Crown Court today, Judge Christopher Critchlow lifted reporting restrictions, allowing Miles to be named.

They are being confined to a housing complex with barracks, a dining hall and a gym, but no outside access, cannot return to their homes and must not interact with other personnel at the site. They must also undergo twice-daily temperature checks for the deadly virus, which has so far claimed the lives of at least 4,922 people, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Above, the base in Vicenza . This is despite the soldiers having been kept apart from any Ebola patients during the 30 days they were helping to build treatment units and training local healthcare workers in the country. Although the guidelines have only affected 13 personnel so far, they could potentially affect up to 4,000 in total, the number that President Barack Obama has committing to sending abroad. Around 600 U.S. military staff - including engineers, medical officials and logisticians - are currently in Liberia; several dozen of whom will be quarantined on their return to Vicenza later this week. In a statement, the Army told ABC that officials that the decision to issue a 'controlled monitoring period' to returning troops had been made over the weekend.

It said: 'The Army Chief of Staff [General Ray Odierno] has directed a 21-day controlled monitoring period for all redeploying soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance. 'He has done this out of caution to ensure soldiers, family members and their surrounding communities are confident that we are taking all steps necessary to protect their health.' A Pentagon spokesman added: 'Out of an abundance of caution the Army directed a small number of personnel, about a dozen, that recently returned to Italy to be monitored in a separate location at their home station of Vicenza. 'None of these individuals have shown any symptoms of exposure.'

Former commander: Upon his departure from Liberia on Saturday, Williams (pictured) transferred command of Operation Unified Assistance  to Major General Gary Volesky, who runs the 101st Airborne Division . The new rules are contrary to the Department of Defense's current policy that 'as long as individuals remain asymptomatic, they may return to work and routine daily activities with family members'.

The new guidelines come as U.S. health officials have issued rules urging voluntary, at-home quarantine for all health workers that have treated Ebola patients in West Africa.

"Australia set the platform for a final-day push for victory in the fourth Test against India after establishing a 348-run lead with four wickets remaining in Sydney. After bowling out India for 475 in the afternoon session to establish a first-innings advantage of 97, Australia's batsmen then went on the offensive as the hosts blazed their way to 251 for six by the close. In-form captain Steve Smith (71) and opener Chris Rogers (56) laid the foundations before newcomer Joe Burns smashed 66 off 39 balls to leave Australia in a strong position to try and seal a 3-0 series victory. Steven Smith scored 71 as Australia looked to set up a final day victory . Ravichandran Ashwin (four for 105) was the most successful of the India bowlers but did not escape the onslaught either as Australia progressed at almost six and a half runs an over. Ashwin had, at least, been able to frustrate Australia with the bat earlier, making 50 as the tourists battled their way to 475 all out at the SCG after starting the morning on 342 for five. It was not such a good day for India captain Virat Kohli, though. Striding out to the middle, Kohli would have hoped to make considerable additions to his overnight 140 but he could add only seven before falling in the fifth over of the day, caught by Rogers at midwicket off Ryan Harris. Wriddhiman Saha's exit was not much better as Josh Hazlewood found some bounce and the wicketkeeper was caught in two minds as he top-edged to Smith at slip to exit for 35. Sean Abbott, the bowler who bowled the fatal ball to Phillip Hughes, was the 12th man at the SCG . Abbott carries drinks during day four of the fourth Test match between Australia and India . Burns put down a tough chance to dismiss new man Bhuvneshwar Kumar and he and Ashwin managed to steer the tourists through to lunch just seven down. And the pair put on a battling 65 to further frustrate Australia before Kumar fell for 30 in controversial fashion. Nathan Lyon's ball appeared to pitch in the same place as the bat hit the ground with the ball going to Shane Watson at slip. There was a slight appeal and when the umpires went upstairs, the wicket was given. Ashwin then brought up his fourth Test 50 off 110 balls but fell to the next one he faced as Mitchell Starc found the edge and Brad Haddin gobbled up the chance behind the stumps. Storm clouds gather over the ground during day four in Sydney . India's cricketer Suresh Raina (right) shouts for a decision against Australian batsman Chris Rogers . Mohammed Shami hammered 14 off the next over as India crept within a hundred of the Australian first innings and Umesh Yadav (four) got them there with a boundary before top-edging Harris to Haddin to leave Shami stranded on 16. That left the tourists with a deficit of 97 but they got off to an excellent start in the field as Ashwin found David Warner's edge and Murali Vijay took a catch at slip to remove the opener for four. The hosts reached 38 for one at tea but Watson was gone shortly after as Ashwin found the edge again but this time it was the bottom edge as the all-rounder chopped on for 16. Australia were looking to attack and Smith hit four fours in an over as the lead raced past 200. Former Australian bowler Glenn McGrath jokes with guests while visiting the Comm Bank Clubhouse . Smith then hit an enormous six off Ashwin before Rogers reached a half-century for the sixth consecutive innings but he was gone five balls later, pulling Kumar to Suresh Raina at deep square leg for 56. Smith registered his own fifty off just 44 balls with a four before Shaun Marsh fell for just one, edging a beauty from Ashwin to Vijay at slip. Wickets were not halting home momentum, though, as the Australians kept the rate up but Smith was next to go for 71, trapped in front by Shami. With the captain gone having taken his run tally in the series to a phenomenal 769, Burns and Haddin took matters into their own hands, finding the boundary almost at will and hammering sixes in three consecutive overs to take the lead past 300. Burns was the last wicket of the day to fall having made his second 50 of the match when he top-edged a sweep off Ashwin in what turned out to be the last over, but by then Australia had already batted themselves into a powerful position.","Australia have a 348-run lead going into the final day .

From there, it was straight to Bournemouth, more miles on the road. He briefed his new squad on Friday night, putting the final touches to the plans drawn up by caretaker boss Mike Phelan and first-team coach Gary Holt to bring down the league leaders.

In the latest dramatic twist in the promotion race, Chris Martin settled the Portman Road contest in the 57th minute. ‘This is a tough place to come but we put in a really mature display,’ said Rams boss Steve McClaren. But when, on 64 minutes, Jonny Howson was shown a straight red card for an ill-advised tackle on Yann Kermorgant and Norwich faced a tense last half-hour against the Championship’s best attack, it was time to clear his head, walk down to the dug-out and take total command. It clearly had the desired effect. Fifteen minutes later, Cameron Jerome picked the ball up 25 yards from goal and, with no other thought, nudged it right and curled an unstoppable shot into the top corner to leave Bournemouth’s 14-match unbeaten league run in tatters. After that whirlwind welcome to English football, the work is only just beginning for Norwich’s new boss. ‘I thought I was better suited to lend my support at the side of the pitch to the players rather than sitting in the stands,’ Neil said. ‘Thankfully for me, we managed to get a goal and go on to win the game. It was a perfect start. ‘The one thing we really want to try and do is rally everyone. It’s important the fans and everyone at the club gives me their complete backing because all it’s going to do is benefit Norwich if we’re going to be successful.’ Match winner Cameron Jerome hugs Norwich manager Alex Neil after the late win at Bournemouth . So far, so good. What was most impressive about Norwich’s win was that it was fully merited. Few teams come to Bournemouth and take them on at their own game. The Canaries were slick in their passing and dangerous on the break, notably when Nathan Redmond was in possession. When Howson was dismissed, a grittier side emerged that greatly impressed the Scotsman. There will be no rest for Neil. Aside from the need to relocate urgently to Norfolk, he will need to stamp his authority on players who, in many cases, are not much younger than him. He takes a ‘firm but fair’ approach to management and admits he isn’t afraid to give those not pulling their weight a kick up the backside. Though Norwich, who moved within a point of the play-offs with this win, have arguably the league’s best squad, Neil is likely to strengthen by poaching Tony Andreu, the 26-year-old Frenchman who is leading scorer in Scotland, from his old club. But Neil can set about this massive in-tray in a very positive frame of mind following this excellent start. WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE... This has no place in football: a group of gay Charlton fans were duped into meeting what they believed was a similar group before their match with Brighton, only to then be attacked. Thankfully, the Charlton Rainbows group later tweeted that their members were fine. MK Dons boss Karl Robinson claimed midfielder Carl Baker had a cup of tea thrown over his head by a Crawley fan during the 2-2 draw. Joel Lynch produced a goal of the season contender in Huddersfield’s 3-1 win over Watford, scoring with a stylish bicycle-kick on his 200th league appearance. Not bad for a defender.

"A Spidercam suspended above the field distracted Australia captain Steve Smith as he attempted to take a catch during the fourth Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. India opener Lokesh Rahul, on 46, skied a Shane Watson delivery high in the air behind the stumps, just before the lunch interval. Smith ran back from slip to take the catch but reacted angrily after putting down the chance, pointing toward the wires of the aerial camera. Smith appeared to immediately mouth 'f****** wire' and was still gesticulating a few overs later when briefly discussing the incident with umpire Richard Kettleborough.

The ball slips out of Smith's hands during the fourth Test between Australian and India . Smith points towards the Spidercam and blames it for distracting him when attempting the catch . Rahul, who was on 46 at the time of the dropped catch, reached his maiden Test century shortly before tea and was finally dismissed for 110 after the interval. A joint statement from Cricket Australia and host broadcaster, the Nine Network, which appeared on the Cricket Australia website, confirmed that Smith had been distracted by one of the wires. 'We (Cricket Australia & Nine) have spoken about the matter involving Spidercam and the dropped catch before lunch and it's clear the ball did not hit the camera or its supporting wires,' the joint statement read. 'Captain Steve Smith was distracted by one of the wires in his eye line.' 'Both CA and Nine will continue to work together on the use of Spidercam in the broadcast coverage and will take on board any player feedback as necessary. 'As it stands, if any player has a concern about the placement of Spidercam they can ask the umpires for it to be moved.'

The camera, which is suspended from wires attached to light towers and can maneuver over the playing area at varying heights, was subsequently moved away from play, near the boundary rope. 'It wasn't ideal where it was positioned for that particular ball,' Australia coach Darren Lehmann said. 'I like watching it, but they have to get the position right when the bowlers bowling, particularly on the off-side, which we are speaking to Channel Nine about.'","Camera above the field distracted Steve Smith on Thursday .

"Booking a ticket online to head to a sports match is normally a simple process as you fly through the forms. Putting in your details is a bit of an arduous process but most of us are normally happy to be called either Mr, Mrs or Miss. However, as first reported in Charles Sale's Sports Agenda column, the online registration form at Lord's this summer offers an extensive list of 52 titles to ensure fans can choose the appropriate title for their tickets to catch this summer's Ashes series, with the second Test against Australia hosted at the Home of Cricket. The Queen meets England players during the Ashes at Lord's between England and Australia in 2013 . They say they want to make all members of society feel welcome – though the majority of the list comprises aristocratic and religious titles and military ranks. Not to mention Queen, for the most important guest of all. Other titles on offer include: Brigadier, Brother, Captain, Commander, Princess, Don, Father, Judge, Lord, Mademoiselle, Reverend, and Wing Commander. However, the list is by no means comprehensive, including earls and viscounts but not dukes. The military ranks also exclude admirals or generals. A spokesman for Lord’s said: ‘We have within our membership a complete cross-section of society, including the Queen who is a patron. The Queen, a patron of Lord's Cricket Ground, meets the England squad during the 2013 Ashes series . The Queen watches the Ashes between England and Australia in 2013 from the Pavilion at Lord's . Prime Minister David Cameron reacts as he is interviewed on BBC's Test Match Special at Lords in 2013 . ‘The membership committee took the decision that they wanted all members to be able to title themselves correctly.’ Usually ticket applications for sports events and concerts allow buyers to choose from just three titles – Mr, Mrs or Ms. But cricket fans entering the ballot to see the England internationals against Australia and also Test matches against New Zealand are free to select any title they wish...which is expected to encourage a few of the more mischievous members of the public to adopt titles that don’t belong to them. Others who might find the extensive list of titles useful are former cricket Baroness Heyhoe Flint (left), and former Prime Minister Sir John Major (right) , a well-known fan of the sport . On the rare occasions that royalty attend Test matches – the Queen visited the Lord’s match against Australia in 2013 – it is unlikely they would opt to sit among the masses. The Queen, and other VIPs, would be seated in the pavilion and would not, of course, be required to buy tickets. The ballot for the Ashes Test with Australia, which starts on July 16, and a Test against New Zealand in May closed at one minute to midnight last night. The cricket ground, in North London, uses the ballot system as a fair way of allocating tickets for matches which are often oversubscribed, because it gives all applicants an equal opportunity. Lord’s was established in 1814 and is widely regarded as the Home of Cricket.","Lord's cricket ground in north London is known as the 'Home of Cricket'

"A brave nine-year-old boy has given a graphic and detailed statement to Oklahoma police about his mother, who allegedly sexually and physically abused her three other children repeatedly as her friends paid to watch. Authorities in Beckham county were alerted to the accusations against Natalie Lynn Webb, 30, in August after a Department of Human Services investigator spoke to the eldest child and reported that Webb was 'selling sex' with her kids to other adults. According to the police affidavit - obtained by The Huffington Post and almost completely based on an interview with the nine-year-old  - the victims were an eight-year-old boy and his two three-year-old sisters. The affidavit says Webb would usher people into her bedroom or bathroom and 'drag' in both three-year-old girls. Natalie Lynn Webb, 30, was arrested in Elk City, Oklahoma is accused of engaging in sexual acts with her three children in exchange for money . The adults were both male and female. It claims Webb would be naked during these incidents, which are said to have occurred on numerous occasions from December 2012 to March 2013 at her home in Elk City. The nine-year-old said Webb would lock the door and that he would hear his sisters screaming 'stop Momma, stop, it hurts', the report says. He witnessed the abuse on one occasion and described a foreign object being used, the affidavit says. One of the three-year-olds was interviewed by police and corroborated the nine-year-old's story, saying it felt 'nasty' when she was abused. The nine-year-old said he also saw his brother being abused, but was able to avoid the molestation himself by running outside and hiding in a dumpster. Most of the details included in the affidavit cannot be published. After her arrest, Webb denied the allegations and demanded a polygraph test, which she failed. The Huff Post reported the mother said to Beckham County Sheriff's investigator Steve Bonds: 'Somebody hurt 'em. I'm supposed to protect my kids.' Bonds then replied: 'Natalie, you didn't.' The allegations are said to have occurred inside Webb's home in Fairview Village, Elk City . Webb confessed to police she often used methamphetamine and sold it out of her house. She told authorities she sometimes traded her food stamps for meth. The nine-year-old said he would find needles but never saw his mom using drugs. He also found pipes that 'smelt really bad' and that 'her arm would have little dots where it was bleeding', the affidavit says. He said his mom would act 'different' and 'weird' when she used drugs and would often fall asleep on the couch . The boy said she would also leave the children alone overnight for two days and that he would after his siblings. '[The 9-year-old] said his mom would not feed them and he would have to find stuff and cook it in the microwave or pop tarts and stuff,' the affidavit reads. 'If there was nothing [the children] would just scavenge the floor. On the floor they would find crumbs or cookies that were there from a week ago.' There are also claims of beatings and that Webb would 'throw the children against the wall' and hit them with 'a bat that has holes in it', a spoon or her fist. Webb has past felony convictions for child endangerment and possession of a controlled substance, along with misdemeanour convictions of unlawful possession of paraphernalia, bogus checks and unauthorized use of a credit card. She has been charged with sexual abuse of children under 12 and child neglect . Webb is being held on a $2 million bond and is due in Beckham County Court on January 6. Her four children are in the custody of their grandparents.","Natalie Lynn Webb, 30, of Elk City, Oklahoma, has been charged with sexual abuse of children and child neglect and is being remanded on a $2 million bond .

"Maria Sharapova moved into the Brisbane International semifinals with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Carla Suarez Navarro on Thursday, weathering a challenging opening few games before taking the momentum away from her Spanish rival. Top-seeded Sharapova dropped her opening service game and then needed eight breakpoints before converting for a 2-1 lead. From there, it was straight-forward progress. 'I lost to her last year. We went back and forth with our victories in 2014, so I'm always a little bit aware of girls that I lose to,' Sharapova said.

"England’s preparations for the Six Nations took a turn for the worse as Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan was carried off on a stretcher before his side won with a stunning last-minute penalty from James Hook. The 25-year-old received several minutes of on-field treatment at Kingsholm after injuring his left ankle in a second-half collision that involved his international rival — Billy Vunipola of Saracens. It was a game billed as a heavyweight battle for England’s No 8 jersey, but the contest could now end up being settled by default if Morgan fails to recover in time for his country’s opening fixture against Wales on February 6. Morgan was man of the series in the autumn Tests and the onus was on his opponent to lay down a marker. Gloucester fly half James Hook fires over a last-minute penalty to secure victory for the home side . Ben Morgan is stretchered off the pitch after the England backrower suffered a leg injury in the second-half . Vunipola sucked in defenders early on from a standing start in midfield. The 22-year-old is one of the most effective players at making gains inside heavy traffic and helped to provide a stable platform from which his side could attack. With Owen Farrell pulling out shortly before kick-off, it was left for Alex Goode to fill in at fly-half. The England hopeful had a tight calf but club officials were confident he will return to full fitness by next week. Goode took over the kicking duties and pinned the Cherry and Whites into the corner in the seventh minute. Saracens asserted their dominance at the set-piece, particularly in the line-out, and were awarded a penalty try after the hosts dragged down a driving maul. Gloucester scrum half Dan Robson touches down in the corner for a sensational try . Robson celebrates his superb score with Gloucester and England No 8 Morgan (left) Gloucester substitute Callum Braley races away for a super breakaway try in the second-half . Hook kicked two penalties to narrow the deficit to one-point inside the opening quarter, but should have been ahead after Billy Twelvetrees failed to pass to Jonny May and finish a simple two-on-one chance. The home side’s poor finishing was then punished as they leaked two more penalties to the boot of Goode. The game within the game, Morgan versus Vunipola, did not quite live up to the billing in the first half, with Gloucester scrum-half Dan Robson being the stand-out performer. The 22-year-old signed for Wasps on Wednesday and showed a glimpse of his skill with a sublime score after 35 minutes. With a seemingly impossible amount of space to work with, the half back wriggled clear and chipped over the last man before touching down his score. Cherry and Whites winger Jonny May (right) is tackled by Saracens centre Marcelo Bosch . Hook missed the conversion but his side were given another shot to take the lead after David Strettle was penalised for a deliberate knock-on. The wing was shown a yellow card, but once again Hook’s kick fell short. Strettle was joined in the sin-bin by Gloucester lock Tom Savage after the break and Saracens used their extra weight in the forwards when Billy Vunipola crashed over from a driving line-out. Then came the moment of concern, as Morgan was replaced by Gareth Evans in the 49th minute. The home side rallied and another Hook penalty sparked a comeback. Callum Braley finished a pitch-length score after good work from May and Evans. George Kruis and May were then sent to the sin bin before Mako Vunipola crashed over to score. But Hook had the last laugh when he kicked a penalty from just inside his own half.

"England batsman James Taylor believes new one-day captain Eoin Morgan is the 'strong leader' needed to drive the side forward. The squad convened in Australia this week without former skipper Alastair Cook, whose chronic lack of form saw him cut adrift and replaced with Morgan on the eve of the World Cup. The Dubliner only has this month's Carlton Bank Tri-Series against the host nation and India to put his stamp on a team that has struggled to find a winning formula in 50-over cricket. But Morgan is an entirely different character to Cook, having made his name as a dynamic short-form player rather than a Test lynchpin, and Taylor is confident he is the man to inspire a change in fortune.

'It's an exciting time for England under Morgs, it's a new era,' he said. 'We're all looking forward to playing under him. I know the kind of guy he is, he's a strong guy and I'm sure he'll be a strong leader too. 'He'll be very similar to the way he bats: exciting and aggressive. 'I have played under him in a couple of ODIs against Ireland and he's a great captain.' Cook might find it hard to share in the sense of enthusiasm as he broods on his axeing and watches the side he led for three-and-a-half years on television. But with the odds stacked against England in both the Tri-Series and the World Cup, the 15-strong squad who began their trip Down Under with a training session in Canberra on Friday cannot afford to ponder their former's leader's fate. 'It was a tough call but we've got to move on,' said Taylor. 'It's something we can't dwell on too much. You're judged on performances and that's what happened in the end with Alastair. 'Ultimately we're all judged on performances and winning games and that's what we're aiming to do. James Taylor is looking forward to the new era under Morgan . 'We're looking to get a bit of rhythm and form in the Tri-Series then in the World Cup who knows what we could do.' Taylor has just six ODI caps to his name but booked his place on the plane by cracking 90 and 68 in successive innings in Sri Lanka last month. Cook's absence means a top-order shake-up is inevitable but what role the 25-year-old Nottinghamshire man has in it remains to be seen. Alastair Cook was sacked as England one day captain after a run of bad results and poor form . 'Hopefully it does open up a spot for me to play but it's up to me to take the opportunity if it does appear,' he said. 'I don't know where I'll be batting in the side, I'm just looking to get in the team. If it's in the middle order or at number three I'm not really fussed as long as I'm playing. 'I had a brief little taster in Sri Lanka and hopefully I can go one step further to cementing my spot in Australia.'

"Little-known jockey Jamie Bargary was thrust into the spotlight on New Year’s Day at Cheltenham as he produced a faultless ride to win the feature race on Splash Of Ginge. For the 20-year-old from Co Tipperary the 9-2 favourite’s three-and-a-quarter-length victory from Hunt Ball in the £50,000 BetBright Best For The Festival Handicap Chase was certainly a tale of the unexpected. Bargary, who is based with trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, had travelled to the track expecting to ride only Pigeon Island in an earlier race. Splash of Ginge, ridden by Jamie Bargary, on the way to victory  at Cheltenham Racecourse on Thursday . But when colleague Ryan Hatch sustained a collarbone injury as Little Jon fell in the Dipper Novices’ Chase won by Ptit Zig, Twiston-Davies handed the responsibility of the mount on Splash Of Ginge to Bargary even though his career total of wins under rules was only five. Bargary said: ‘I had about a quarter-of-an-hour’s notice. I had my suit on and was ready to leave. The Pigeon Island ride was good enough. He ran a blinder to finish fifth.’ Bargary, who had ridden only nine point-to-point winners, joined Twiston-Davies a little over a year ago after spending two years with David Pipe. He added that, anticipating only one ride, he had not set his TV to record the big race but he was sure to have plenty of reminders last night in The Hollow Bottom, the Twiston-Davies stable’s local pub. It was there that Splash Of Ginge’s owner John Neild and his ‘Ginge Army’, which yesterday numbered 50, had toasted their talented gelding’s win in last season’s prestigious Betfair Hurdle and the plan was for a repeat. Twiston-Davies said: ‘It is only Jamie’s sixth winner but he is very good. It was a faultless display of jockeyship. John Neild is so kind to the boys, he likes to give them all a chance. Ryan Hatch stepped in when Splash Of Ginge won the Betfair Hurdle. Jamie Bargary riding Splash Of Ginge, clear the last to win the Handicap Steeple Chase at Cheltenham . ‘The landlord of the Hollow Bottom is probably ordering more beer as we speak. After the Betfair Hurdle it took them two-and-a-half days to leave there.’ Splash Of Ginge was travelling well when he fell four out in the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup, won by Niceonefrankie, at Cheltenham’s December meeting. His owner’s Liverpudlian roots will make Aintree a target later this season but, before that, Twiston-Davies intends returning the seven-year-old to the novice ranks with the JLT Chase at the Festival being his target. Lying in wait there will be the Paul Nicholls-trained Ptit Zig, an impressive six-length winner of the Dipper Chase yesterday under Sam Twiston-Davies. Being a Grade One winner over hurdles and good enough to run in last season’s Champion Hurdle, when he was sixth to Jezki, the two-mile Arkle Chase might have seemed Ptit Zig’s natural target but Nicholls is adamant he will get better as he goes up in trip. 20-year-old Bargary celebrates his unexpected win on Thursday to pocket a £50,000 jackpot . Yesterday’s race, in which he beat Champagne West six lengths, was over two miles five furlongs, and Nicholls sees next season’s three-mile King George as a longer-term target. Nicholls also landed the BetBright On Mobile Handicap Chase with Grand National possible Mon Parrain, whose jockey Sean Bowen helped make it a big day for the young faces in the weighing room. The 17-year-old son of Welsh trainer Peter Bowen went on to complete a 285-1 double on his father’s Rolling Maul in the Betbright Casino Handicap Hurdle. The two wins were his first at Cheltenham and followed his first ever treble at Chepstow on Welsh National day. Little wonder he is being tipped as a rider to follow. Nicholls said: ‘Horses seem to run for him. He will be very good.’ Bargary clears the last on way to a three-and-a-quarter-length victory at Cheltenham on New Year's Day .","20-year-old won the feature race at Cheltenham on Splash of Ginge .

This is the first report since the 1960s on how the risk of arrest varies across race and gender, said Robert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the study. The study's most striking finding is the variance amongst males of different races: . Nearly 40 percent of white males have been arrested by the time they are 23, which can have a negative impact on their ability to find work, go to school and participate fully in their communities . ‘A problem is that many males – especially black males – are navigating the transition from youth to adulthood with the baggage and difficulties from contact with the criminal justice system,’ said Brame. The negative impacts can be great, he said. ‘Criminal records that show up in searches can impede employment, reduce access to housing, thwart admission to and financing for higher education and affect civic and volunteer activities such as voting or adoption. They also can damage personal and family relationships.’ The research also looked at arrest rates amongst females, although unlike with their male counterparts there was little variation between races. The report found that: . Brame says the next step is to develop an understanding of the economic, social and law enforcement factors that can influence arrests and what role gender and race play. The report found that by age 23, 49 percent of black males, 44 percent of Hispanic males and 38 percent of white males have been arrested . 'As a society, we often worry a great deal about the effects of children watching television, eating junk food, playing sports and having access to good schools,' said Brame. 'Experiencing formal contact with the criminal justice system could also have powerful effects on behavior and impose substantial constraints on opportunities for America's youth. 'We know from our two studies that these experiences are prevalent and that they vary across different demographic groups. 'Going forward it will be constructive to support systematic studies into the sources of these variations and to continue efforts to understand the effects of criminal justice interventions on sanctions on future behavior.'","A third of Americans have been arrested by the time they are 23 according to a new study released in the Crime & Delinquency journal on Monday .

"France captain Thierry Dusautoir has snubbed a move to Leicester and signed a two-year contract extension with Toulouse. Tigers chief executive Simon Cohen revealed on Wednesday that the East Midlands club were in talks with the back-row who, Sportsmail understands, has now decided to remain in the Top 14. Holding discussions overseas will no doubt have helped the flanker secure an improved deal with his club. France captain Thierry Dusautoir has turned down a move to Leicester to stay with Toulouse . With forwards Tom Croft and Julian Salvi both out of contract this summer, Leicester had lined up the 33-year-old as a possible marquee signing to bolster their pack. But they will now have to look elsewhere after missing out on the 2011 IRB Player of the Year, who is one of his country's most respected sportsmen and wrote a column in response to the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris. 'I'm just a rugby player,' said Dusautoir. 'But I want to say what has kept me going since my early years, since I set up home in France from my native Ivory Coast, is camaraderie, togetherness. 'Mixed race, from a white French father and black Ivorian mother, my primary school years quickly taught me that I was more tanned than the others, that I had a strange accent where sometimes I'd roll my Rs too much, sometimes I'd swallow them. But my friends from Perigueux, they would laugh with me. Harlequins and England flanker Chris Robshaw (second right) has recovered from a shoulder injury . 'Terrorists do not respect anyone. The minute of silence on our rugby fields this weekend, wanted by the federation and the League, will be our witness. I'm probably no more legitimate than others to speak but, as captain of France's rugby team and as a public figure, I will continue to defend the difference and fight for us to live together.' Dusautoir will renew his rivalry with England captain Chris Robshaw during next month's Six Nations. The Harlequins flanker has recovered from a shoulder injury and will face Leicester on Saturday after five weeks on the sidelines. Robshaw will start alongside veteran No 8 Nick Easter, who on Friday confirmed that he has agreed a two-year contract extension. At 36, he is one of his club's most experienced players and will make his 250th appearance at the Stoop this afternoon. Veteran No 8 Nick Easter (centre) has agreed a two-year contract extension with Harlequins . 'I'm enjoying my rugby, looking to improve my game, and as long as I've got a desire and hunger for it, it's that simple,' Easter told Sky Sports. 'I've still got that thirst to continue the success we had for two or three years when we won three trophies. We didn't win anything last year and that drives you on as well.' Easter's former England team-mate Tom May, 35, on Friday announced that he will retire at the end of the season. The London Welsh centre, who previously played alongside Jonny Wilkinson at Newcastle and Toulon, will be hoping to go out on a high after a miserable first part of the season with the Exiles. 'It's a tough decision and there's a certain amount of fear that goes with making that decision but also a huge amount of excitement,' said May. 'I've been lucky to play for some great clubs, Newcastle, Toulon, Northampton and to then have the opportunity to try and create something with London Welsh — getting out of the Championship and playing this season in the Premiership.'

"Toulon full-back Delon Armitage has had his 12-week ban for using abusive language reduced to eight on appeal. Armitage was found to have directed a foul-mouthed tirade at Leicester supporters in the aftermath of Toulon's 25-21 Champions Cup defeat at Welford Road on December 7. A European Club Rugby statement read: 'An independent Appeal Committee has today upheld an appeal by Delon Armitage against the 12-week suspension imposed on him for misconduct.' Toulon's Delon Armitage (left) has had this 12-week ban reduced to eight weeks following an appeal . Armitage was found guilty of verbally abusing Leicester supporters following his side's loss in December . Toulon fans hold pictures in support of Armitage during the French Top 14 match between Toulon and Lyon . The three-man appeal panel that met in London on Thursday delayed their verdict until Friday evening. The statement continued: 'The Appeal Committee found that the independent Disciplinary Committee had made an error in how they determined the period of the appropriate sanction for the misconduct and moved to impose a suspension of eight weeks on the player. The suspension will now run from 17 December 2014 until 8 February 2015, therefore Armitage will be free to play on 9 February 2015.' In his time at London Irish the fullback was banned for five weeks for a dangerous tackle on Bath's Tom Biggs . After the reigning European champions had lost to Leicester, Armitage made a number of comments within earshot of spectators, including children, using foul and abusive language. In a damning verdict released by the hearing that imposed the 12-week suspension, the former England international was found to be 'an habitual offender' with 'an appalling disciplinary record'. Armitage was banned for eight weeks in 2011 after a misconduct complaint for using threatening and/or abusive language towards an anti-doping official was upheld and he has also been suspended on three separate occasions for incidents of foul play on the pitch.

"The prospect of Great Britain's Davis Cup squad being bolstered by Slovenian wannabe Brit Aljaz Bedene appears to have been severely dented by the non-arrival of necessary paperwork. There now seems to be no likelihood that he will be in contention for the World Group first round match at home to the USA in March, despite his hopes of becoming a British citizen by then. The International Tennis Federation said on Wednesday that they had not received any relevant documentation before the December 31 deadline which saw a rule change hindering players from switching nationality. Slovenia Aljaz Bedene is applying for British citizenship after living in the Stevenage area since 2008 . Bedene, 25, has lived in the Stevenage area since 2008 and has already been ranked as high as 71 in the world, although he is currently down at a falsely low 156 after struggling with wrist injuries last season. Many see the athletic baseliner as having top 30 potential. On Tuesday he was reported from India, where he is currently playing, as saying he hoped to be in the reckoning for the tie in Glasgow, the biggest on British soil for decades, as he expects his citizenship to be confirmed within the next week. However, governing body the ITF said on Wednesday: 'We didn't receive any request regarding the Davis Cup before the December 31st deadline for him to be considered to play in the competition.' Last year they passed a new rule – coming into effect on January 1 - forbidding a player to switch nationalities for official team competitions if they have represented another nation already. While Bedene has never played a ""live"" rubber for Slovenia (when a tie was yet to be decided) he has featured in their squad three times, the last being nearly three years ago. Bedene in action during the AEGON Championships at London's Queen's Club last year . It seems the only way he can now hope to represent GB in official team competitions is if he starts an appeal process, on the basis that his citizenship was imminent at the time of the regulation coming in. He would need to be supported by the Lawn Tennis Association, whose lawyers have been involved in his application to become a British citizen. A LTA spokesperson said on Wednesday: 'We are awaiting a decision regarding Aljaz's citizenship application. Should he be successful, then it's a matter for the ITF as to whether he is then eligible to represent the GB Davis Cup team.' Regardless of that, Bedene is still able to represent Britain as an individual at tournaments if he gains his passport, which is entirely up to him. Wednesday's development solves any potential dilemma for British Captain Leon Smith about whether to select him for Glasgow, where Andy Murray is expected to play alongside James Ward, who is on the verge of the top 100. Great Britain Davis Cup captain Leon Smith appears from the locker room in Naples last April . The match is being played on an indoor hard court, but in future Bedene could be a real asset on clay, which he is comfortable on, and the weakest for many British players. Smith has built a strong team spirit in the Davis Cup that Murray has bought into, and it might have been disrupted by a late incomer. Although Bedene is a popular enough figure among his peers, when he first declared his intention to play for Britain last year it did not go down universally well. Nor was his appearance for Hertfordshire in the LTA County Cup in 2013 totally accepted either. Great Britain celebrate after beating USA 3-1 in the Davis Cup World Group in San Diego last year . Former British No 2 Dan Evans was among those who spoke out last year, although the Midlander's plummeting ranking since does not see him as a realistic contender for the Glasgow team. Evans might have been considered, but has somewhat vanished from the British tennis scene after suffering knee problems last summer, and is no longer part of any official LTA set-up. However, he is said to be training back in the Birmingham area and planning to come back at smaller events in the next month.

"Sir Bradley Wiggins has announced that he has set up his own cycling team in a bid to win gold on the track at the Rio 2016 Olympics. The 2012 Tour de France winner has assembled a nine-man squad, composed entirely of British riders, and will be funded by Sky but known simply as ‘Wiggins’. Sir Bradley Wiggins is launching a new cycling team for young British talent called 'Wiggins' He is expected to make his debut for his new team in June when he tries to break the individual world hour record at the London Velodrome. ‘The whole idea of the team was to facilitate our ambitions for Rio and winning gold there,’ Wiggins told Sky Sports News. ‘It’s track-based and we have got a lot of the guys from the track programme in there so that we can stay and race and train together all year round and get exactly what we need in terms of achieving the end goal, which is winning the team pursuit in Rio.’ The team, endorsed by British Cycling, will be sponsored by Wiggins' long-time support Sky . The switch means Wiggins, who will be 36 by the time of the Rio Games and who has suggested he will retire afterwards, will not ride in the Tour de France again. Wiggins’ new team-mates include the cream of Britain’s young talent, such as Owain Doull and Jon Dibben, as well as more experienced riders such as Andy Tennant and Steven Burke, who should all be in the reckoning for the four-man team pursuit squad for Rio. Wiggins has three medals — bronze, silver and gold — in this event from the Sydney, Athens and Beijing Olympic Games, but the competition for Rio will be fierce, with no guarantee that he will make the final four. Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner, says cycling has given him 'everything' and he wants to give back . ‘It’s not a given that Brad will be in the team in Rio,’ Shane Sutton, British Cycling’s technical director, said recently. ‘But when Brad gets a focus it’s very hard to knock him off track.’ The four-time Olympic champion, 34, will continue to race for Team Sky, where he has had a fractious relationship with team-mate Chris Froome, until April and his final outing will be at the Paris-Roubaix Challenge. Wiggins, who was ninth last year, believes he can be the first Brit to win the tough one-day Classic over the cobbles known as the ‘Hell of the North’. ‘Cycling has given me everything,’ he said. ‘Now I want to build something to inspire kids and to reach all those people who might be on the fringes of the sport. ‘My message is simple: if I can do it, then so can you.’ Referring to his bid to beat Matthias Brandle’s individual hour record, Wiggins added: ‘The next 12-year-old might come along that may be inspired by watching the hour record like I was inspired watching Chris Boardman win the gold in Barcelona.’ Sir Bradley Wiggins was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2013 .","Sir Bradley Wiggins will launch team 'Wiggins', sponsored by Sky .

'But the last three games has seen teams sit in against us.It is difficult to break that down but we have had chances. If you look at the first minutes of games we have had chances and if they go in it becomes a different game. 'We have to find that creativity spark to unlock it when it is as tight as that. We had 752 passes against Blackpool and we had 69 per cent possession and 60 per cent of that was in their half, so it is not as if we are playing in our own half.

"The recently concluded investigation into Newtown killer Adam Lanza revealed that a psychiatrist who treated him as a teen has since surrendered his license. Dr. Paul Fox once held licenses to practice in Connecticut and New York but in 2012 he gave them both up in the face of charges he may have crossed a line in his relationship with a patient. Investigators reached Fox in New Zealand, where he now lives, in a telephone interview told detectives all he remembered about the cold-blooded killer. Scroll down for video . Killer: Lanza saw Dr. Fox during part of his adolescence up until he was about 15 years old. Fox recalls little about the killer, but says he had 'aggression problems' and possibly Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism . According to the Danbury News Times, Fox was cited for 'negligence on more than one occasion' and 'possible boundary violations' with an unidentified patient. Instead of facing the shaming and scrutiny of a full-fledged investigation into the matter, Fox voluntarily surrendered his license in both New York State and Connecticut. Fox was Lanza's primary psychiatrist during much of his adolescence, but had trouble recalling many details when investigators called him following the horrifying attack on Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012. He said he vaguely remembered Lanza, who was 15 when he last saw him. Revelations about Dr. Fox's time treating Lanza came as the investigation into the Sandy Hook massacre concluded last week, along with painful photos like these taken from the scene of Lanza's unthinkable crimes . Unthinkable: A year after Sandy Hook, newly released photos make the horror that took place the day Lanza killed 20 children and 6 adults and details like those provided by Dr. Fox provide little insight into why the 20-year-old did such a thing . '[He] recalls Adam having aggression problems and possibly having been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome,' reads the state police report. 'He recalled Adam as very rigid and resistant to engagement. He was unable to provide any further details concerning Adam.' Authorities have given no indication that Lanza is one of the patients whose relationships with Dr. Fox were suspect. The psychiatrist and his wife of nearly 25 years filed for divorce just a month before Fox surrendered his license. He now lives in New Zealand, where he works in a 'child social services,' according to the Stamford Advocate. Fox has so far declined to speak out on his time as Lanza's mental health caregiver. The final police report on the Sandy Hook school shooting revealed a photograph of an unknown boy as a baby dressed in camouflage gear and gnawing on a gun .","Dr. Paul Fox gave up his license to practice in Connecticut and in New York after facing allegations of misconduct .

"Sam Vokes is hoping to make up for lost time after rediscovering his scoring touch for Burnley. The striker made his second appearance following nine months out with a ruptured cruciate ligament as the Clarets took on Tottenham in the third round of the FA Cup. Vokes came off the bench with half an hour to go and converted Michael Kightly's cross in the 73rd minute to earn Burnley a 1-1 draw and a replay at White Hart Lane next week. Sam Vokes celebrates scoring the equaliser against Tottenham in their FA Cup third round clash . Vokes was making his second appearance after nine months out with a serious cruciate injury . It was the 25-year-old's first goal since a penalty in a 2-0 victory over Doncaster on March 25. Four days later, Vokes suffered the injury early in a match against Leicester, but the 21 goals he had already scored played a major role in Burnley's promotion. He made a brief comeback on Boxing Day against Liverpool but had to endure more frustration because of illness. That was all forgotten as the ball flew past Spurs goalkeeper Michel Vorm, and Vokes is now hoping to make his mark in the Premier League. The Welshman said: 'It puts nine months' work into perspective. It was a great feeling to get back out there and score. 'I was a bit gutted over the Christmas period. I got on against Liverpool and then picked up a chest infection. I've only had a couple of sessions since the illness and it's knocked me back a little bit. Vokes arrives to side foot his shot beyond Michel Vorm for 1-1 . Michael Kightly, who delivered the cross for Vokes' goal, is tackled by Spurs' Ben Davies . 'It was great work by Kights down the right-hand side. I saw he was heading to the byline, he pulled it back and it fell right to me so it was nice. 'There was a lot of emotion. The lads were great. They all came over and congratulated me and there were a few nice comments afterwards. It does mean a lot. 'You go through some hard times mentally and physically in the gym and when you're stuck on the sofa, but it's nice to come out the other side and hopefully I can kick on now.' There was a bittersweet tang to Vokes' achievement, though, after the news his team-mate Kevin Long had suffered the same injury. The defender had played just 20 minutes of Premier League football when he landed awkwardly during Burnley's 3-3 draw at Newcastle last week. It was announced on Tuesday that Long had signed a new contract keeping him at Burnley until 2017, and Vokes will do all he can to help on the long road ahead. 'I wouldn't wish that injury on anyone,' said Vokes. 'It's horrible. And when you get that phone call, I remember where I was, and it's not nice. Burnley's Kevin Long (right) goes down with a similar knee injury to that suffered by Vokes . Long left the field on a stretcher against Newcastle ... Vokes said he 'wouldn't wish that injury on anyone' 'I spoke to him the night he got the news, talked him through it. It's a tough one to take. 'But it's a strange kind of mentality because you get your head round it as soon as you get the information, it's going to be a nine-month thing, and then you try to crack on. I think he's heading down for the op this week and I wish him all the best. 'Fifteen or 20 years ago you'd be lucky to get back out on the pitch. You look for inspirational stories and there's a lot out there now.' With Burnley's squad depleted by injuries and Tottenham facing two games a week for the rest of January, a replay was probably the last thing either team wanted. But boss Mauricio Pochettino insisted the prize of a fourth-round tie against Leicester is one that Spurs will give their all to secure. Of his side's hectic fixture list, the Argentinian said: 'I am not concerned. I'm confident in our squad. All our players are in good physical condition. 'It's true that I am a little bit disappointed because we need to play another game. But this is football. 'I think we need to stay in the FA Cup and get to the next round. It's important.

"Police in Phoenix have ended the 1,800-mile reign of terror of a bank robber who killed an officer in  Tupelo, Mississippi, and wounded another. The robber was shot dead by a Phoenix police detective during a gun battle with cops on Saturday after they intercepted him when he robbed a bank there - his third heist in just a week. The violence ended a week of mayhem that began Monday morning in Atlanta, Georgia, and sparked a nationwide manhunt. FBI agents are confident that the man who died in Phoenix was also responsible for the robberies in Atlanta and Tupelo because his cell phone records show he was in those places at the times of the crimes. His clothing and behavior at the previous robberies also match the Phoenix heist.

"Queen Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton believes that footballers should be thought of as role models, but people should not be so quick to castigate players if and when they make mistakes. The 32-year-old feels that more consideration needs to be given regarding the pressures that come with living life in the public eye. And Barton, renowned for his straight-talking approach, is mystified by the idea that footballers are expected to behave perfectly all of the time while competing on the pitch. Joey Barton (right) challenges Ki Sung-Yueng (left) of Swansea for possession in the Premier League clash . Barton (second right) tries to calm Wayne Routledge (third right) as tensions spill over . 'Are footballers role models? I suppose we are, and we have to be mindful of what we say and what we do, but as an industry we take ourselves far too seriously,' Barton said in an interview with the Daily Mirror. 'I see pundits on the box, saying kids will watch Match of the Day and copy what they see, but if you tell your children to live their lives exactly as they see footballers on the telly doing it, you must be a bit of an idiot. 'If you copied Hollyoaks or EastEnders everyone would kill each other over Christmas, because that's what happens on TV, isn't it?' Barton added that learning from mistakes under the gaze of the masses provides high profile figures with pressures that most people do not have to face. Barton will look to lead Queens Park Rangers to their first away win of the season against Burnley on Saturday . 'We all screw up, we screw up multiple times on multiple scales, but when every decision you make is in the spotlight, a lot of responsibility comes with it,' Barton said. Barton will be looking to lead by example when QPR travel to Burnley on Saturday, looking to end a miserable run of 10 defeats in 10 on the road in the Premier League this season.","Joey Barton says footballers are role models in an industry that takes itself too seriously .

"Jason Puncheon's clinical finish after an excellent run from substitute Wilfried Zaha gave Crystal Palace a huge three points from Tottenham in their first Premier League match under Alan Pardew. After a scoreless first half, Harry Kane's dream run continued with a 49th-minute gem as the towering striker got the ball out of his feet and fired into the bottom corner. However, a penalty drilled home by Dwight Gayle after 69 minutes and Puncheon's strike on 80 minutes gave Pardew a sensational win.

"The Three Bears consortium seeking boardroom change at Rangers were  no closer on Saturday to discovering what agreement — if any — might be struck with the current regime in a deal for acceptance of their £6.5million funding rescue package. As wealthy Rangers-minded businessmen Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor wait and hope for a resolution in the coming days amid gravely uncertain times for the club, there remains mystery, too, concerning the involvement of the football man linked to their push for change. Felix Magath, the former Bayern Munich and Fulham manager, was in Glasgow over a week ago for discussions with a representative of the group and it has been revealed that the 61-year-old is keen to adopt a technical director-style role. Felix Magath purchased a one per cent stake in finacially troubled Rangers last week . One friend and former colleague is convinced that a man of Magath’s stature, talent and knowledge would be a brilliant asset to Rangers. Nevertheless, he is baffled by the development that the German would consider turning his back on management to seek such a role at a Scottish club where finances are tight and entirely unpredictable. Mark McGhee was a team-mate of Magath at Hamburg in the 1980s and their relationship has continued throughout their coaching careers nearly 30 years on. McGhee has recruited players on the recommendation of the German, most recently at Bristol Rovers, and the pair met up again to talk football when Scotland played a friendly against Nigeria at Fulham’s Craven Cottage stadium last summer. The Scotland assistant manager was linked with a role at Fulham during Magath’s brief reign in charge but that never came off and his first stint in Britain ended with the sack in September. In the wake of his dismissal, Magath (below) maintained his methods would be suitable for the English game and stressed that his next job would be in the UK. The former Fulham manager has held talks about taking on a director-style role at the club . McGhee, however, does not view a rebuilding job of Rangers from top to bottom as an obvious attraction for his friend. McGhee said: ‘If Felix is up for trying to turn Rangers around as a club on the football side, then they will have a great asset because he is a top man. ‘He is studious, intelligent and bright. He is also very single-minded, always with a very clear picture of what he wants from players and people around him. ‘He does not compromise much on that. He has a fairly established model of how he thinks it should be done and what he wants to do. ‘He has a great work ethic and requires that of his players. So Rangers would certainly get their money’s worth with him. ‘But if it’s a director of football role or technical director, then I can’t imagine what he will do if there is no money to spend on players. ‘From what I know of him, he would be frustrated. I find it a bit mysterious. If he is finished as a manager, then that’s a surprise to me. To give up now? That’s a bit of a mystery.’ Scotland assistant Mark McGhee (right) played with Magath at Hamburg and finds the mystifying . Magath was unveiled last week as having a one-per-cent stake in Rangers, an investment of £200,000. His interest is understood to extend to wishing to overhaul Murray Park where the Rangers development and scouting areas have been stripped to the bare bones over years of mismanagement and disregard by the hierarchy. McGhee added: ‘To be fair, Felix is a gambler, a punter. He doesn’t mind speculating. So it could be there’s a bit of that going on which he finds attractive. ‘I’d have thought, though, someone of his Champions League credentials would still have commanded a big- money post. ‘One of the things Felix requires is control, so I can’t imagine him going anywhere and staying long where he will have to kowtow to anyone. If he’s given autonomy, then the move (to Rangers) could work.’ McGhee praised Magath's football knowledge and said he would be a fantastic asset to Rangers . Magath will be waiting in the wings to see if the Three Bears can seize control at Ibrox. Some hurdles were cleared during last week’s talks but there remain others to be addressed with the main stumbling blocks being the make-up of any new Rangers board. It is believed the Rangers-friendly consortium are cautiously optimistic of striking a deal early in the week. Both parties should be keen to reach a resolution without the costly and lengthy resort of an EGM but that would be the most likely step if the proposal is not accepted by the current regime. Phoenix Suns basketball owner Robert Sarver’s camp have yet to learn of the Rangers board’s response, either, to his improved offer of £20m, including a short-term £6.5m loan. Sarver was told his earlier £18m bid was thrown out because it undervalued the club. His push is unlikely to succeed as he requires 75-per- cent support but the Park/Letham/Taylor alliance plus Dave King control 33 per cent of votes.","Felix Magath is keen to adopt a technical director-style role at Rangers .

"Louis van Gaal has been left with a £200million conundrum after admitting he will be forced to leave out at least one of his attacking big hitters against Southampton at Old Trafford on Sunday. With Manchester United’s injury crisis over, Van Gaal’s biggest challenge now is to make sure he does not disrupt the team balance with too many stars after an 11-match unbeaten run. And the way the Dutchman was talking, he has already decided not to play all of his ‘famous five’ — Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Falcao, Angel di Maria and Juan Mata. Louis van Gaal has conceded he will have to leave out one of his so-called 'famous five' against Southampton . The Dutchman insists he will not hide behind the excuse of squad rotation when selecting his team . Manchester United are in the rare position of having practically their entire squad fit for the visit of Southampton . So far, Van Gaal has not had to make this toughest of choices because at least one of the quintet has always been injured or not match-fit. But the goalscoring return of Di Maria off the bench at Yeovil last weekend means all five are available. It is a decision Van Gaal has typically promised not to shirk and to his credit he insists he will not hide behind the excuse of rotation. ‘I have said for years the highest number of players you can put in who are mostly creative is four. I still have the same opinion in 25 years. Four is a lot. So when you call these players then I have to choose,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I always put in the best line up, not rotation. You understand the difference? ‘You can call it rotation if a player is tired and then it’s better to play with the other quality player, but normally I look at the qualities of my opponent, the qualities of my selection and also the mental situation of my players.’ Radamel Falcao (left) is eager to make his loan move permanent while Robin van Persie (right) has never been dropped at United . Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney is expected to keep his place in the side . Angel di Maria (right) made a scoring return from injury against Yeovil while Juan Mata (left) has impressed in the playmaker's role . Apps   Goals   Assists . Wayne Rooney         17         8           5 . Radamel Falcao        11         3          3 . Juan Mata                 15         5          3 . Angel di Maria           13         3          6 . Robin van Persie       19         8          3 . Wayne Rooney (£27million), captain and close to overtaking Sir Bobby Charlton as the club’s record goalscorer, is probably the only one who will wake up fully confident of being selected to start. Van Persie (£24m) has never been dropped in his United career and was Van Gaal’s captain at the World Cup but is no longer ‘bomb proof’ due to competition for places. Falcao, who will cost £43m if United make his loan move permanent next season, showed his finishing skills to save his team in their last Premier League game at Stoke on New Year’s Day but Van Gaal questions his contribution outside the penalty area. Juan Mata (£38m) was tipped to be the sacrificial lamb when Van Gaal arrived but has been in outstanding form as a genuine No 10. Di Maria (£60m) has been absent with injury while United have embarked on their unbeaten run. He takes risks on the ball that are not normally associated with a Van Gaal team but it would still be a huge call, even for someone of the Dutchman’s inpenetrable confidence, to axe the most expensive player in the Premier League. Van Gaal insists he will not swayed by leaving out a player like Di Maria just because he cost a British record transfer fee . Falcao saved his manager's blushes by scoring against Stoke to earn a draw on New Year's Day . Publicly, Van Gaal insists he will not be swayed by the size of a player’s transfer fee. Neither can Ed Woodward or the United board be expected to sanction a move for Falcao if he doesn’t make the first XI, although Van Gaal again says he does not automatically agree with that. ‘You can have in your squad selection more than four creative players. But only in the line-up you can put four players. So there is a big difference,’ he said. ‘It is not for you to decide about Falcao. I have read he is very happy here and wants to stay. ‘I am a different manager. The best players, what I think, make the best team. The money is not interesting. For me, it is not interesting.’ After a tough start to life at Old Trafford with 50 different injuries to contend with, Van Gaal is warming to his task now. United sit third in the table with Chelsea and Manchester City above them and his ambition to be top dog at the end of 2015 doesn’t look unrealistic now. Leaving Mata out of the starting line-up would likely see Rooney move back out of midfield into the No 10 position . Van Gaal is brave enough to make difficult decisions, including leaving out his former international captain Van Persie . Van Gaal was smiling like a kid in a sweetshop when he announced that he only had one player, Ashley Young, injured and unvailable for Southampton. Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw and Di Maria are fit again after damaging absences. Rafael and Falcao should be fully up to speed in terms of match sharpness. Besides fitting in his star forwards, the Dutchman has to continue developing United’s own youngsters James Wilson and Adnan Januzaj. He hopes in time to produce a side as pleasing on the eye as some of Ferguson’s great entertainers. ‘Of course, I want more as a manager, I want the perfect game and we’ve not played the perfect game, like Ajax and Real Madrid 20 years ago (Ajax won 2-0 at the Bernabeu). ‘I expect more attacking quality from Manchester United and from a team that I coach. So now I coach Manchester United, I expect more attacking quality. If not this year, then next season or the season after that. But I shall improve and you shall see it.’ Holland international Daley Blind (2nd left) is one of several players returning to full fitness at Old Trafford . Manchester United players are put through their paces at the club's Aon Training Complex ahead of Sunday's game . Ashley Young is the only member of United's squad you is sidelined after limping off against Stoke . Ronald Koeman gives short shrift to managers who claim they need more time . Van Gaal won’t rule out January signings but only if the right player becomes available. If he has to wait for Matt Hummels of Borussia Dortmund, he will wait. ‘I don’t prefer to wait until summer when I can improve my selection. I have shown that with Victor Valdes,’ he said, referring to last week’s signing of the former Barcelona goalkeeper. ‘When we can buy a player who can improve my selection I, or the club, shall buy. Money is not interesting, it is always what I have to say, the quality of the player in comparison with the other players that I have. And I have to compare and I have to decide. The money doesn’t play any role. ‘When I cannot improve my selection then I wait. And then I have to wait maybe a year more, because maybe you think there are so many fantastic players who can join. But it is not like that.’ Southampton will be a tough test. United were extremely fortunate to leave St Mary’s with a 2-1 win last month after a double from Van Persie. Van Gaal’s compatriot Ronald Koeman still has the club on course for an unlikely Champions League challenge. The two Dutchmen haven’t always been the best of friends — dating back to a rivalry when working together at Ajax — but the United boss couldn’t give Southampton higher praise going into this game. The United manager has not ruled out making more signings in January after bringing in former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes . Van Gaal will come up against his former friend and protege Ronald Koeman when Southampton arrive at Old Trafford on Sunday . United were fortunate to come away from St Mary's with a 2-1 victory when the sides met back in December . ‘When I see the quality of the players and the coaching staff, I think they could finish in the top four. I think it would be good for English football to have a different club qualifying for the Champions League and I think Southampton have the chance this year. ‘They made it very difficult for us at their ground and I think they will give problems again because they have a very good team. I like the way they play. ‘But we are a month further on from that game and maybe we have improved, I hope so because we are in a process, I hope we have improved so we can show that against Southampton but it shall be very difficult because they are very good.’ While Southampton think about the top four, the four occupying Van Gaal’s mind are his four superstar forwards — and who to send out at Old Trafford.","Third placed Manchester United host Southampton in their Premier League clash on Sunday .

"Adrian Bevington  is to leave the FA and his role of managing director of Club England, English football's governing body announced on Tuesday. The highly-respected Bevington, who deals most closely with the England team within the FA hierarchy, has negotiated his exit after 17 years at the FA where he also combined the job of director of communications. Bevington leaves the FA with a considerable vacuum at the top of the organisation, with general secretary Alex Horne also going at the end of next month. FA director of communications and managing director of Club England Adrian Bevington is to step down . Bevington (second left) and Alex Horne (left) are both leaving the FA. They are pictured with FA Chairman David Bernstein (centre), England boss Roy Hodgson and Sir Trevor Brooking (right) in 2012 . The communications director, who announced his ambitions of becoming a club chief executive in a sports business magazine profile before the World Cup, has long seen 2014 as his likely last year at Wembley. And the FA management reforms being carried out by chairman Greg Dyke post-Brazil have clarified that decision. The Club England set up, formed in 2010 to oversee the England operation at all levels and led for the last four years by Bevington, has been heavily diluted by the arrival of technical director Dan Ashworth and his blueprint for training England teams. Bevington will leave his role with the FA after 17 years with English football's governing body . And it is Ashworth who now effectively controls the England set-up at all levels from his St George's Park base along with his team of coaches and sports scientists. However, Bevington will long be remembered at the FA for his consummate skills as an outstanding communications chief. And the way he handled numerous high-profile FA scandals and controversies over the years, ensures he will always be in high demand as a damage limitation specialist - inside and outside sport. Losing Horne and Bevington in such quick succession will now put a lot of pressure on Dyke to find the right replacements. The FA's director of elite development Dan Ashworth's role has diluted Bevington's responsibilities . Bevington, quoted on the FA's website, said: 'It has been a privilege to work for The FA, but after almost two decades I want a new challenge. 'I have been considering my departure for some time and discussed this with Chairman Greg Dyke recently. I am grateful to Greg and The FA Board for their support over the years and in agreeing to my departure at the end of the month. 'The FA has provided me with tremendous experience and I look forward to drawing on this in the future. Bevington (right) watches on as Roy Hodgson and Steven Gerrard talk during England training . 'While it is a disappointment to leave without England winning a major trophy, I am convinced the foundations for success are now in place. 'A huge part of my working life has been spent at The FA and I have worked with so many wonderful people in the industry, both domestically and internationally. I would like to thank everybody who has helped me over the years.' FA chairman, Greg Dyke, added: 'I'd like to thank Adrian for his contribution and loyalty over almost 17 years at The FA. 'His experience and knowledge have been invaluable at so many levels, but he has made clear he is at a time in his life where he is ready to move on. 'I know that everybody who has worked with him over the past 17 years will miss him, and on behalf of The Football Association I would like to wish him every success in the future.'","FA announced exit of second senior executive in quick succession on Tuesday .

"Chelsea will consider loaning Andrej Kramaric to Leicester City as they look to close a £7.5m deal with his club for the striker on Monday. Leicester have a £7.8m bid on the table for the HNK Rijeka goalscorer but the player wanted to move to a bigger club. Juventus have also made a play for Kramaric but only wanted to offer £4.5m plus add-ons. If all is agreed on Monday the player is expected to travel to London on January 5 to have a medical. Chelsea are closing in on a £7.5m deal for Rijeka striker Andrej Kramaric (right) The contract is for four and a half years and the player will initially be paid around £20,000 a week after tax.

Our manager, Roberto di Matteo, has eyed him for his plans. And the player definitely wants to join our club, too.' The one snag could be Schalke's request to sign him on an initial loan with City wanting around £10m for the 21-year-old Serbia international centre-back.

At present we are negotiating in agreement with his father. The proposal from Roma could bring some advantage compared to that of Tottenham. 'In Rome there's a possibility for Ezequiel to play another year at Newell's, while going to Tottenham would be another six months. In my opinion both offers are valid, although I think Roma's is slightly better.' AC Milan are interested in a deal for Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado and will discuss the possibilities today (Monday). However, the cash-strapped Italians may only be able to offer an initial loan which Daniel Levy is likely to reject.

Barron echoed Tomlinson's sentiments: 'I had such a great time making the first movie, and watching Bassett become such a football icon over the years has been wonderful. With the Germans dominating football again, we brainstormed a really fun idea and it felt right to bring him back. We can't wait to get started. 'It's the passion of the fans that convinced us a Bassett return is welcome and that's why we're looking to create a film that is partially fan-funded via Kickstarter. It's innovative fundraising and enables us to create a film for football fans, made by football fans.' 'The Kickstarter element is a brilliant way of getting people involved in the film.

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes has completed his first signing of the January transfer window with the capture of Germany international Philipp Wollscheid.

The twice-capped defender currently plays for Bayer Leverkusen, although had spent the first few months of the current campaign on loan with Mainz. German international Philipp Wollscheid has joined Stoke on loan for the rest of the season . The Bayer Leverkusen centre-back has arrived at the Britannia Stadium with view to a permanent switch . Delighted to capture such a quality player, via the club's official website, Hughes said: 'Philipp is a player we've been aware of and have been tracking for some time. 'He will add to the competition for places in the centre of our defence. 'He's got presence, technically he is good, has played at a high level, has gone for big money in the past, and to get a German international at a relatively young age is a good deal for the club.

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes believes his side can now compete with the best clubs in Europe for some of the game's big names. On Tuesday Hughes signed Germany international and Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid on loan until the end of the season, with a view to a permanent move in the summer. More surprisingly, Stoke were this week linked with a club-record deal for Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri, who instead signed on loan for Inter Milan from Bayern Munich ahead of a £12million summer switch. Centre back Philipp Wollscheid could make the move from Bayer Leverkusen permanent in the summer . It was no cheeky attempt by Hughes to snatch Shaqiri, who was also linked with Liverpool and City's Barclays Premier League opponents on Sunday in Arsenal. Hughes feels it is a measure of how far Stoke have come throughout his tenure that agents are willing to listen to his overtures rather than snub the club. 'We get the opportunity to discuss things at that level now, and I don't think that was the case here before,' said Hughes. 'It's fair to say in the past we've said to agents 'we could be interested' and the response has always been 'don't bother'. Stoke boss Mark Hughes had been linked with an audacious bid for Bayern Munich ace Xherdan Shaqiri . 'That was probably the case in previous years, but that's certainly changed in my time here. 'We've brought different types of players here and players talk. They understand what we're trying to do, the football grapevine is everywhere and we become an option. 'Of course, we need to be in the top half of the table, that's the key to it, and if you're a consistent team you are an attraction. 'Don't underestimate the power of the Premier League as well. We can offer a good club, a well-run club, with good players already here. Hughes look set for a busy January as he continues to strengthen his side during the transfer window . 'It's a good environment, a good situation to come into, with an opportunity to progress if you do well, so we've a lot to offer if you look at all the boxes we tick.' It remains to be seen if Wollscheid will be given his debut against Arsenal, although given Stoke's record away to the Gunners they need all the help they can muster. Stoke have lost on their last 12 visits, be it at Highbury or the Emirates, with their last success in that part of north London dating all the way back to 1981. Hughes is hoping the stunning 3-2 success over Arsene Wenger's side just five weeks ago at the Britannia Stadium in early December will play a part. Robert Huth (left) will be joined in defence by fellow German Wollscheid who joins the Potters on loan . 'If you look at our record at Arsenal it isn't great, and neither is my own personal record with other teams before Stoke,' said Hughes. 'But this is an opportunity for us as we're playing them quickly after a very positive performance and result last month. 'Hopefully, from a psychological point of view, it might help us more than Arsenal. We hope it's a benefit. 'We certainly have to improve our record down there, and if we are to do that then we have to force them to work harder than they have done in the past.' Hughes has four players on the brink of a comeback from injury in defenders Marc Muniesa and Marc Wilson, midfielder Victor Moses and striker Bojan Krkic.

"The architects who designed Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium and Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena are looking at ways to increase the capacity of Stamford Bridge towards 60,000. According to the Architects' Journal, Herzog & de Meuron are working with Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands to potentially design a revamp of Chelsea's 41,837-seater stadium to satisfy demand for tickets at the Premier League leaders' home. Chelsea, who have previously looked in to building a new stadium at Earls Court, White City and Battersea Power Station, announced in June they had commissioned a study into how Stamford Bridge can be expanded. Chelsea are looking in to ways to expand their 41,837-capacity Stamford Bridge stadium . Chelsea had previously looked in to moving to Battersea Power Station (above) The stadium is surrounded by buildings and next to a railway line in the heart of the Fulham Broadway area and no viable expansion method has yet been found despite owner Roman Abramovich's best efforts since buying the club in 2003. According to the Architects' Journal, Swiss-based Herzog & de Meuron could recommend decking be built over the railway line to the east and the north of the stadium and have launched consultation on the extent of the plans. A statement released by Chelsea in June read: 'A study of the area from Fulham Broadway town centre to Stamford Bridge and beyond has been commissioned by Chelsea Football Club’s owner Roman Abramovich. Stamford Bridge is surrounded by housing, buildings and a railway line . 'This study will review the potential for improvements to publicly-owned areas along Fulham Road and the area around the football ground, including the possibility of decking over the railway lines to the east and north of the ground. This could create landscaped public walkways and cycleways, while also reducing pedestrian traffic on Fulham Road and nearby streets on match days. 'The study will also assess the feasibility of an expansion of the stadium within the existing historic site boundaries, potentially to enlarge its capacity, enhance its facilities and improve the movement of people and vehicles on match and non-matchdays.' Neither Herzog & de Meuron and Chelsea FC were available for comment when approached by the Architects' Journal.

"Valencia manager Nuno has heaped praise on Cristiano Ronaldo, labelling him 'the best player in history' ahead of his side's match against Real Madrid on Sunday. According to Spanish newspaper AS, the former Porto goalkeeper - who took over as Valencia manager in July - has welcomed Madrid to the Mestalla with maximum praise for the Los Blancos star. 'He's the best in history, a perfect machine,' Nuno said of Ronaldo. 'But fear not, we are not afraid. That word does not exist in football. We think we can beat any opponent and we also have a strong dynamic at home.' 'Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in history' reads the front page of Spanish newspaper AS on Sunday . Valencia sit fifth in La Liga after 16 games, but go into Sunday's crunch clash off the back of two straight league wins. Madrid, though, are on another level entirely. They have won 22 matches in a row since a 2-1 away loss to Atletico Madrid in September. They are top of the league with a game in hand, but despite this, Nuno believes his Valencia side do have a chance against Carlo Ancelotti's men. 'We have played some very good games and one of those ended in victory. The key is how we face every game. You have to play every ball as if it were your last and fight hard. It will be a good match.'

"It is a measure of the job facing David Moyes on Sunday night as his Real Sociedad side face Barcelona that he comes up against one of the scourges of his Premier League managerial career in Luis Suarez and yet the former Liverpool striker will not be his biggest concern. Moyes must also deal with Leo Messi who scored 58 goals for club and country in 2014 and wants to start 2015 in style. Moyes said of the Argentine: 'We will try to stop him but everyone tries to stop him. He is a very special player. We have all been privileged to watch him play over the years.' Suarez, who will partner Messi and Neymar in attack for Barcelona this evening, clashed with Moyes in the 2012-13 season when the then Everton manager criticised him for diving ahead of a Merseyside derby in which Everton's Phil Neville ended up being booked for simulation. VIDEO Scroll down to see Messi and Suarez in game of keep-ball ahead of Sociedad clash . David Moyes' Real Sociedad will host Catalan giants Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday evening . The match will see Luis Suarez face Moyes for the first time since the two men left England . The Uruguayan striker celebrated Liverpool's first goal in front of the Everton dug-out by diving at Moyes feet and he wrote in his autobiography Crossing the Line published last year: 'David Moyes complained that I was a diver and then his captain, Phil Neville, got a yellow card for diving during the match. 'Moyes's comment struck me because they were made before the game; you can talk after the game if I have dived against your team but he complained before so I thought: 'You think I dive? I'll show you a dive.' Suarez also scored against Moyes when Liverpool beat Manchester United 3-0 a month before he lost his job. Speaking ahead of tonight's game the Real Sociedad coach, who has made a steady start at the Basque club, underlined the enormity of the task in hand facing Barça. Suarez dives in front of Moyes in celebration after scoring in the Merseyside derby in October 2012 . Moyes has won two, drawn four and lost one game since taking over as Real Sociedad's manager . He said: 'It's difficult to take the game to them because they have so much of the ball. They have fantastic individual talents who can win the game on their own but for the sustained success that they have had you need more than that. They have been a special team and still are. I am really looking forward to the game. I am looking forward to challenging such a good team.' With Suarez, Messi and Neymar all recently back from mid-winter breaks in South America and the club still reeling from the refusal of the Court of Arbitration to reduce the FIFA-imposed year-long transfer ban, this may be a good time to play Luis Enrique's side. Real Sociedad beat Barcelona last season and have already taken the scalps of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid this campaign. Moyes added: 'The players have shown they can beat Barcelona before so we have to show it again. We have to show them that this is not an easy place to come and win. We have to be tough.' But, as well as Suarez, Moyes will have to find a way to stop Lionel Messi and Neymar on Sunday .

"Real Sociedad coach David Moyes faces his biggest La Liga challenge yet when second-placed Barcelona visit on Sunday and says his players have shown they are capable of beating the best. The former Manchester United manager took charge of the relegation-threatened club in November. Since then they have lost only once but also have just one victory from five league matches. Moyes wants to win a place in Europe next season although Sociedad are down in 14th place, two points off the relegation zone. David Moyes is left in no doubt that his Real Sociedad side can beat Barcelona this weekend . Sociedad have actually acquitted themselves better against the stronger sides this season . The Basque club have proved this season they can rise to the occasion against stronger sides, having beaten Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid at home before Moyes took over. Barca also have a poor record in Sociedad where they have not won in the last four visits. They lost there last season. 'If we can play as well as we did in those two games (against Real and Atletico) we have a good chance of winning,' Moyes said. 'We face a very good team who are very competitive but the players have shown they can beat Barcelona and they need to do it again. 'We want to have a great start to the New Year and beat Barca and do all we can to start moving up the table,' said Moyes.

I watched them play the 2011 Champions League final against Manchester United at Wembley. They are a great team and (Lionel) Messi is very special but they have household names in all positions.' While Sociedad have looked more solid at the back in recent games, it has come at a price as they are struggling to create chances going forward. 'We will go out looking to be hard to beat and then when we have the ball we will look to cause Barcelona damage,' said Moyes. 'They are undoubtedly a very good side and we respect that but they have to come to Anoeta and we need to make it difficult for them.'","Real Sociedad host the mighty Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday .

"Andy Murray gave Rafael Nadal a sobering start to the new year on Friday by handing him a crushing defeat, although a new injury concern prevented it from being a perfect afternoon for the Scot. The French Open champion, playing for the first time since October after undergoing surgery on his appendix, was hammered 6-2, 6-0 by Murray in the season's unofficial curtain raiser in Abu Dhabi. While Nadal was shown how much work he needs to catch up, Murray's only concern after a highly impressive display was some stiffness in his left shoulder. 'It's sore and I've never had that issue before, I'll see how I wake up,' said the 27 year-old Scot. Andy Murray celebrates as he thrashes Rafael Nadal in the semi-final of the Abu Dhabi exhibition event . Nadal plays a forehand during his last-four clash against Murray at the World Tennis Championship . He will have a precautionary scan in the hope that it is nothing more than early season aches before he is scheduled to play in what is nominally the final of the Mubadala exhibition event against Novak Djokovic. Murray had looked contrastingly sharp to Spain's finest, who has only played seven matches in all since Wimbledon, and clearly lacks match sharpness and fitness. Having played a surprisingly tough two and a half hour match against Feliciano Lopez the day before, the world No 6 came back out and thumped Nadal - giving him a first win of sorts against a player from the top three since undergoing back surgery in September 2013. It already looks clear that his time spent in Miami last month with Amelie Mauresmo was no less rigourous than previous training blocks under the guidance of Ivan Lendl. Murray stretches to play a volley at the net as he storms to victory in Abu Dhabi . A general view of the stadium in Abu Dhabi's Zayed Sport City as Nadal takes on Murray . 'You never know how you are going to feel until you get out on the match court,' said Murray. 'Today was an improvement and I'm pleased. All the hard work is paying off. 'There were a lot of long games, it shouldn't really have been that scoreline. He had a lot of game points but I was able to win the important points.' Nadal did threaten the Murray serve, but could not convert one of his twelve break points in a match of proper intensity. On many occasions when he pressured Murray he threw in unforced errors to let him recover. This is what happens when you have not played much and he will doubtless improve, but it is unlikely that the official ATP season opener in Qatar next week will be enough to get him fully firing in time for the first Grand Slam of the year, which begins in Melbourne on January 19. Murray scrambles to his right to play a forehand back to his Spanish opponent . Nadal approaches the net to play a volley in the semi-final exhibition match in the United Arab Emirates . While no ranking points are at stake Murray will already have been encouraged by beating Nadal so easily, especially after the drubbing received at the hands of Roger Federer in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in November. Little, in truth, can be read into these kind of events, but what should be encouraging to Murray is the way he moved so well at this embryonic stage of the season. There were fewer forays to the net than the previous day, but then Nadal's groundstrokes are not what you want to test your volleying skills against. Murray's serve did look vulnerable at times but, like his vanquished opponent, he knows that many aspects can be sharpened up with a volume of matches.","Andy Murray beat Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0 in the semi-final clash .

"England outcast Kevin Pietersen helped to set up a Super Over Big Bash win for Melbourne Stars, and left Andrew Flintoff voicing wonder that his former international team-mate is surplus to World Cup requirements. Pietersen (54) hit his second half-century of the tournament as his team tied the match, chasing Sydney Sixers' 150 for six at the MCG. Then James Faulkner sealed the deal with two sixes off Brett Lee as the Stars racked up 19 to overwhelm their visitors in overtime. Kevin Pietersen fumbles a catch that was later taken by team-mate Cameron White . Pietersen (left) celebrates the catch with Tom Triffitt (centre) and White (right) Their second victory keeps them in the reckoning for a semi-final spot thanks in part to Pietersen, who hit eight fours and a six in his 37-ball 50 - after former England batsman Michael Lumb had made 80 in vain for the Sixers. The Pietersen show left an admiring Flintoff gasping for superlatives in the commentary box, and pondering the circumstances which have left the South Africa-born batsman out in the cold for England. Flintoff told Sky Sports 1 viewers: 'There will be people around the world today watching and thinking ""He doesn't even play for England - why oh why?""' The former England batsman was in fine form with the bat at as Melbourne Stars won . Pietersen salutes the crowd as he reaches his 50 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Pietersen lost his way a little once reaching his 50 with a boundary, and was eventually caught-behind off a mis-pull at Doug Bollinger - after which Flintoff said: 'He played well. But you've got to say he did half of his job here.' The Stars appeared to have passed up their opportunity, until late hitting from Tom Triffitt and Faulkner tied the scores. England's selectors and management have already made it abundantly clear on numerous occasions that, after 34-year-old Pietersen's controversial sacking 11 months ago, he will never again figure in their plans. They have already picked their 15 for the World Cup, which will get under way when they face Australia in Melbourne on February 14, and that list will be re-confirmed on Wednesday when all 14 competing nations are scheduled to announce their final squads.

"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes insists his team can't rely on Celtic crumbling in the Premiership title race. The Dons could move four points clear of the reigning champions with an eighth straight victory when they take on St Mirren in Paisley on Saturday afternoon. Yet McInnes has told his players that they shouldn't be looking to Ronny Deila's men showing any signs of strain. Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes is targeting his eighth straight victory as the Dons face St Mirren on Saturday . 'I don't think Celtic see it as pressure,' he said. 'That's just part and parcel of being Celtic. They are expected to win things.' Aberdeen's run of league wins, built in part on a sequence of seven clean sheets, needs to be extended just 90 minutes further to equal the series of victories achieved back in season 1988-89. McInnes, recognising the importance of continuing to get results while his team are in flying form, admitted: 'From our point of view, I think nobody expected us to win seven games in a row. Ronny Deila's Celtic are hot on the heels of Aberdeen in the race for the Scottish Premiership title . 'I get that, because we've not done that very often in our history. We've won that – and that has allowed us to get where we are. For that to continue is a big, big ask. But it's something we'll be striving to achieve. 'The next challenge is to win eight in a row. If we continue to win games, then we will be satisfied that we're improving as a team. I do see the improvement in us from last season and that's all I was looking for at the start of the season, regardless of where we finish in the league. 'I do believe that, while we've got this bit of momentum, it's important to try to channel it properly.'","Aberdeen could move four points clear in the table if they win on Saturday .

"Andy Murray had a new look and there were a few early signs of a new game style as he kicked off his season with a surprisingly hard-fought exhibition victory over Spain’s Feliciano Lopez. With the all black kit of his suppliers Under Armour making its debut, Murray took two and a half hours to defeat the world No 14 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 at the Mubadala World Tennis Tournament in Abu Dhabi. Despite the length of the match, there was more intent from the ex-Wimbledon champion to shorten the points by being prepared to attack the net, something he is sure to have worked on over the past month with coach Amelie Mauresmo. Andy Murray eventually saw off Feliciano Lopez after a two and a half hour match to kick off his season . The British No 1 was wearing his new all-black Under Armour kit in Abu Dhabi for his first match of the year . It may be an unofficial event with no ranking points at stake but there was precious little hit ‘n giggle about an intense contest, with both players clearly keen to get a proper game in with so little time ahead of this month’s Australian Open. ‘It was a tough match and the last few games were very hard,’ said Murray, who is training hard alongside competing this week. ‘It was a hard way to start the new year and I hope the matches get a bit easier from now on!’ Murray takes on Rafael Nadal in the tournament semi-final on Friday, with the French Open champion very much in need of match tightness with Melbourne already looming. The experienced Spaniard Lopez put up a brave fight before Murray eventually came through . Murray was more aggressive than usual, but the new approach was not always as successful as hoped . Murray looks to be trying to develop his net game and overall tried to be more aggressive than we are accustomed to seeing. The intention was commendable although the results were mixed against the veteran lefthander. He was by far the better player in the tiebreak which he won 7-1, before letting the second set slip late on. He broke serve three times in the decider but struggled to consolidate his lead and close it out, needing five match points in the final game. In the second match, Stan Wawrinka saw off another Spaniard in Nicolas Almagro with a straight-sets victory in just over an hour. Murray was made to work hard for his victory, and said he hoped the matches get easier as the year goes on . Stanislas Wawrinka set up a clash with World No 1 Novak Djokovic with a convincing win over Nicolas Almagro . Wawrinka put on a dominant display to clinch the first set 6-3 before Almagro, who replaced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the tournament as the Frenchman nurses an arm injury, came out of the blocks flying - winning the first game of the second without dropping a point. But his Swiss opponent got the better of him and turned the set around as he raced to a 6-2 victory to set up a last-four clash with world No 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic.","Andy Murray wins 7-6 5-7 6-4 against the experienced Spanish player .

"Gabriel Zakuani's three-year-old son, Trendy, was named partly because of his dad’s love of Twitter trending. One of the Peterborough centre-half’s daughters is named after Crewe Alexandra, despite him never having played for them. And he once appeared in a video for a Dizzee Rascal single, having met the rapper when they were teenagers taking part in a version of Ready, Steady, Cook. Conventional, he isn’t. On footballing duty for his international side, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zakuani, 28, feared for his safety as the team bus was rocked by rival fans, then pelted with rocks in Malawi. And he has been bewildered in Libya by gunfire during training and military helicopters buzzing around during a competitive match. And while the defender, who was born in Kinshasa in 1986 and then raised in London from six, routinely plays in front of crowds of about 6,500 in League One, at London Road, he is about to experience an Africa Cup of Nations (ACN) where the crowds and fervour will verge on the hysterical. Gabriel Zakuani appeared in a video for a Dizzee Rascal single Flex . ‘People associate Zaire with wars, extreme poverty and two sporting events — the Rumble in the Jungle and Zaire being the first [sub-Saharan] African team at the World Cup,’ he said. ‘The national team is something the whole country follows and it dictates the mood. Win and there’s a party until the next game. Lose and it’s the opposite. Football is the [barometer of] happiness.’ Zakuani is one of three English-based players in DRC’s squad for the ACN, which runs from next Saturday until February 8 and is being staged in Equatorial Guinea after original hosts Morocco withdrew through fears from Ebola. West Bromwich Albion midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu, 27, and Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie, 25, are the others. ‘On a football night, the build-up alone [in DRC] is crazy,’ said Zakuani. ‘Training sessions are packed, 40,000 will come, singing, dancing, getting excited by good skills. After the session they’ll try to rush the pitch. They want pictures for their Facebook. We need a military escort to get anywhere!’ Zakuani joined Fulham from Leyton Orient for £1m in 2006 but made only two appearances for the club . DRC are in Group B in the ACN, up against Zambia, Tunisia and Cape Verde. Zakuani is optimistic DRC can shock a few people, not least because they emerged from a tough qualifying group behind Cameroon and Ivory Coast. The latter are ANC favourites and Cameroon are among the contenders. The DRC squad found out they had qualified in unusual circumstances in November, while crossing Africa in a jumbo jet en route from Congo to Belgium. ‘We had beaten Sierra Leone in our final qualifier but were waiting for other results to see if we had got the place available for best third-place team,’ said Zakuani. ‘Mulumbu asks a stewardess if we can get the pilot to call to the ground and get someone to look on the internet for results. She says fine and off he goes and later comes back down the aisle with all the scores written down. We were through! Everyone on the plane screamed and cheered. We cracked open the champagne. It was a nine-hour flight and the same length celebration.’ Zakuani was born in Kinshasa, Zaire and moved to London as a young child . Zakuani came to Europe in 1994 when his dad, a translator, moved the family to London. ‘Gabi’ and his brother Steve both became attached to clubs, Gabi at Leyton Orient, Steve with Arsenal before moving to the MLS. Zakuani got to know Dizzee Rascal when they both lived in east London, upcoming teenaged stars in their fields. ‘I started at Orient and he was from Bow and big in the area. Me and Dizzee would be making the headlines each week for the Hackney Gazette. I was the footballer coming through [around 2003] and Dizzee was getting nominated for the Mercury Prize. ‘There was a local version of Ready, Steady, Cook and we were invited to take part and became close, inseparable for a time.’ Zakuani moved from Orient to Fulham, then on loan to Stoke, where he was playing in 2007 when a late-night call from Dizzee ended in him starring in the video for the single, Flex. Defender Zakuani has been with Peterborough for most of the past seven years . It was around this time Zakuani was living near Crewe, following the fortunes of the club — and becoming attached to the moniker. He and his partner, Shanice, named their fourth child, now seven months old, Croux-Alexis. ‘She’s sort of named after Crewe Alexandra because I lived near there and my wife loves the sound of it, also I’m a big fan of Alexis Sanchez so it fits,’ said Zakuani. Croux-Alexis has two older sisters, Destiny and Heaven, as well as brother Trendy, now three. ‘We were looking at names and it was at a time when I was very active on Twitter and my missus was into fashion,’ said Zakuani. ‘Trending and trendy made sense.’ Zakuani has been with Peterborough for most of the past seven years aside from a six-month hiatus with Greek side Kalloni from last January. He was going to go there on an 18-month contract but ‘something felt not right’ and he signed for six. ‘That was a good decision,’ he said. Gabriel Zakuani and wife Shanice Petrie with new baby, Trendy . He returned to Posh in June on a two-year deal and it was there that he met Bolasie, who was playing for Plymouth. ‘We were opponents, defender and attacker,’ said Zakuani. ‘Then early in the game he says to me he used to come to my house when I was a kid and I was thinking, “What’s this wind-up?” ‘During the game, he carried on talking about the house where I grew up, then started name-checking my brothers and sisters! I asked my mum and dad about it afterwards and it turned out the Bolasies did come to our house back then. The families know each from back in Congo! Me and Yannick have been close ever since.’ The pair have shared some memorable trips, including to Libya, which Zakuani says ‘stands at No1 for craziness’. He adds: ‘Training was like being in a war zone with gunshots around you. The sign at the hotel said “No guns allowed”. There were metal detectors to get through the door. ‘A helicopter hovered over the pitch during the game — low! We drew and at the end were told to wait in the centre circle for our own safety until the stadium emptied. Malawi was another interesting one. Stones pelted at the bus, opposition fans rocking it. We lost 2-1.’ As for ACN 2015, Zakuani, having been part of a team who beat Ivory Coast away in qualifying, says DRC can believe in progress: ‘Why not? Ivory Coast are favourites, but we’ve beaten them. We got the last ticket to the party. Stranger things have happened.’","Gabriel Zakuani will play for Democratic Republic of Congo at the Africa Cup of Nations .

"Hatem Ben Arfa has reached an agreement with Newcastle to have his contract terminated with immediate effect. The winger was sent to Hull on a season-long loan last summer but Tigers boss Steve Bruce cut his spell at the KC Stadium short after becoming frustrated with the Frenchman's attitude. Ben Arfa's Newcastle contract was due to expire at the end of this season but he has agreed for it to be torn up in order to secure a permanent move to Ligue 1 side Nice. French international Hatem Ben Arfa has agreed a deal with French club Nice after leaving Hull early . The 27-year-old's loan spell is being cut short by Hull having played just nine games for the club .

The attacking midfielder is expected to continue his career in the red-and-black jersey.' Ben Arfa was pictured training with his new team-mates on Saturday and is due to sign a contract on Monday. He made just eight Premier League appearances for Hull before Bruce dropped him, with the former Sunderland boss telling the BBC: 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal. Ben Arfa scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but is surplus to requirements at St James' Park . 'I'm disappointed. We brought him in on a wave of publicity and there has been no fallout or slanging match. 'His views of the game are different to mine. At any club you need to have a certain work ethic to get in the team, that's the frustrating thing.' Ben Arfa netted 14 goals in 86 games for Newcastle before departing for Hull but former Magpies manager Alan Pardew made it clear that he would not be welcome back at St James' Park. 'He won't be coming back here, that's all I can say,' said Pardew.","Ligue 1 side Nice have agreed a deal to sign Hatem Ben Arfa .

"Read MARTIN SAMUEL's expert view on what the future holds for Hatem Ben Arfa . Hamburg have joined Nice by showing interest in Newcastle midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa. The 27-year-old is free to leave the North-East after failing to impress during his loan spell at Hull City. Lille and Monaco are also interested in Ben Arfa, but the Bundesliga side's enquiries are the most advanced. Ben Arfa, who has 13 caps for France, joined Hull on a season-long loan after Newcastle boss Alan Pardew criticised him for a lack of professionalism. French international Hatem Ben Arfa has emerged as a target for Bundesliga side Hamburg . The 27-year-old's loan spell is being cut short by Hull having played just nine games for the club . But he has only made nine appearances for Steve Bruce's side and the Hull manager told the BBC last week: 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal. 'I'm disappointed. We brought him in on a wave of publicity and there has been no fallout or slanging match. 'His views of the game are different to mine. At any club you need to have a certain work ethic to get in the team, that's the frustrating thing. Ben Arfa scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but is surplus to requirements at St James' Park . 'I hope Hatem takes in what I've had to say to him because his talent is there for all to see. But talent without hard work means you won't live up to your potential. 'To play for me you have to know you are playing for the team. To be a great you have to be a team player.'

"Frank Lampard has insisted he never intended to play for another Premier League club after leaving Chelsea in the summer. The 36-year-old midfielder was caught in an embarrassing row after Manchester City were forced to admit they had unintentionally misled the public on both sides of the Atlantic from the moment it was announced Lampard had ‘signed’ for New York City FC on a two-year deal last summer. That, was not true. Nor was the subsequent announcement that the 36-year-old had joined City on a ‘loan’ until the end of the calendar year. The truth, admitted by City, is that Lampard put his name only to a pre-contract agreement with NYCFC, stipulating that he would join them on January 1. Manchester City have admitted that they have misled fans and New York City over Frank Lampard . City had wrongly claimed that Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move . But Lampard insisted that despite the furore he will move there in the summer. He told The Times: 'I had sat down with Ferran (Soriano, the chief executive of both clubs) and it was all about New York. There was no mention of Man City. If they had wanted to speak to me on behalf of Man City, with New York in the pipeline beyond that, because I was a free agent, but that was never the question at all. 'To be honest when I thought about five or six months off, I thought it was quite a result. I thought I've been playing solid for a long, long time. It will be a good break. I'll find a way to keep fit. I thought I maybe could train with Chelsea.' The only binding contract he signed was with City, one that saw him contracted to the club for one season with a ‘break clause’ inserted that would enable him to head to New York for MLS pre-season in January if deemed convenient. Lampard smiles during his press conference after it was announced he would be joining the MLS club . The former Chelsea man pictured in action during City's Premier League clash with Sunderland . City, quite legally, removed that clause on New Year’s Eve in order to keep him until the end of the season. Lampard has made 19 appearances for City in all competitions, scoring seven goals, including a late equaliser against Chelsea, when he refused to celebrate. He added: 'In a million years I wouldn't celebrate if I scored against Chelsea. I used to celebrate when I scored against West Ham, but that was a different situation. When I left West Ham there was a hostility from me towards them over certain things - old new now. But with Chelsea? Never. 'I swear to God, if I went to the Bridge and they booed me for 90 minutes and I scored the winner, I still wouldn't celebrate. It would never come into my head and I think the fans there understand me and how I feel about it. I would never celebrate against Chelsea. That would be ridiculous.'","New York City FC fans were told they had signed Frank Lampard .

"Jamie Carragher has backed Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' decision to rest Raheem Sterling because it can prevent the forward from 'being over played then breaking down'. Rodgers left Sterling out of the squad that won 1-0 against Sunderland on Saturday, and the 20-year-old was absent when Liverpool beat AFC Wimbledon 2-1 in the FA Cup third round. And Sportsmail columnist Carragher feels letting Sterling go on holiday to Jamaica was the right move to prevent the England international from burning out. Raheem Sterling has been enjoying some time off after a hectic first half of the Premier League season . Sterling shares a snap of where he is staying in Jamaica on Instagram with the caption 'Paradise' The 20-year-old has been playing as a striker to fill the void left by Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge . 'Brendan Rodgers' decision to give Raheem Sterling a break abroad for the last two games certainly provided plenty of comment this morning,' Carragher wrote on Kicca. 'If the result at Sunderland [on Saturday] had gone the wrong way it would have been used as a stick to beat him with. Before the FA Cup game at Wimbledon Sterling had played more minutes this season than any other player in our league at 20, and the way he plays with plenty of high intensity runs means it will eventually take its toll. 'The problem is he's Liverpool's most important player at the moment the same as Michael Owen was at that age and we know that contributed to him being over played then breaking down. 'This is something that happened to [Cristiano] Ronaldo at Man United at that age and is the right decision, just thankfully for Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers we got the three points!!'

"Sir Bradley Wiggins has signed a short-term contract extension to remain with Team Sky until April, the team has announced. The new deal will keep Wiggins with Sky until after Paris-Roubaix, which he has made a major target for the coming season. After the famed race over the cobbles, which takes place on April 12, Wiggins will switch his focus to the track as he prepares for the 2016 Olympic Games, as well as a planned attempt at the hour record. Sir Bradley Wiggins, at the start of a time trial, has signed to remain at Team Sky until April . Wiggins said: 'Everyone knows what this team means to me so I'm really pleased to extend my contract until the end of April 2015. I've been with Team Sky from the start. 'I've had some amazing experiences during that time and I hope there are a few more to come. Sky's investment in cycling, and this team in particular, has helped change the cycling landscape in the UK and I'm proud to have played a part in that story. 'Paris-Roubaix is a special race for me and I'm determined to give it another go in Team Sky colours. It's one of the toughest races in the calendar and my aim is to improve on my ninth-place finish last year. After that I can focus fully on preparing for the Rio Olympics in 2016.' Wiggins, on the podium in 2014 after winning the Road World Time Trial Championship, will race Paris-Roubaix . At Team Sky Wiggins (centre in the yellow jersey) has won the Tour de France back in 2012 . There had been speculation last month that Wiggins might ride at least part of this season's Giro d'Italia, which starts in May, but that had already been ruled out by Sky team principal Sir Dave Brailsford. Wiggins is due to launch a new Sky-backed development squad, dubbed Team Wiggo, this season, and he is expected to ride with that squad after Paris-Roubaix as part of a program tailored towards the track. Wiggins, the first British winner of the Tour de France in 2012, joined Team Sky for its inaugural season in 2010, and has claimed 23 victories in Sky colours. The 34-year-old endured a mixed season with Team Sky but still managed to win the Tour of California . Brailsford said: 'We're delighted that Bradley's extended his contract with Team Sky into 2015. He's been with Team Sky since the beginning and during that time he's been an incredible ambassador for cycling and an inspiration to millions of people around the world. 'Rightly he still has big ambitions for the future and everyone at Team Sky will work their hardest to make his final chapter with us a successful one over the next few months.'

"Manager Garry Monk admits Swansea must stop Andy Carroll to avenge last month's 3-1 defeat to West Ham at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday. Carroll has been a thorn in Swansea's side in the past two seasons, making both goals for Kevin Nolan in a 2-0 home victory last term and then scoring twice at Upton Park in December as West Ham overturned an early Wilfried Bony strike to run out comfortable winners. Monk believes Carroll is the strongest forward in the Barclays Premier League and admits much of Swansea's game plan this week has been based on keeping the 6ft 4in target man quiet. Andy Carroll (second left) heads in against Swansea as West Ham won 3-1 in December . Carroll's fitness this season has been a huge factor in West Ham's impressive form so far . Garry Monk feels his Swansea team need to combat the threat of Carroll if they are to beat West Ham . 'It's something we have to put right but he is an incredible player physically,' Monk said about the 26-year-old Geordie. 'He is probably the most powerful forward in the Premier League and he has supremacy over everyone. 'Sometimes when the ball in is right, there's not much you can do, but we have to try to stop him and that's something we've been working on. 'We want to put in a performance so we can put our performance down there earlier in the season behind us. 'We just felt disappointed at West Ham because we didn't reach our usual performance level and we don't want to make the same mistake again. 'We didn't give a good account of ourselves and we didn't use our strengths well enough in the game and, hopefully, we can do that better this time.' Swansea would go level on points with seventh-placed West Ham if they beat Sam Allardyce's side but the build-up to the game has been dominated by the potential loss of top marksman Wilfried Bony to Manchester City. Swansea players applaud their supporters after a 1-1 draw against Queens Park Rangers . Wilfired Bony (second right) could be leaving Swansea to join Premier League champions Manchester City . Bony, who is unavailable on Saturday anyway as he is away with his national team ahead of the African Nations Cup, is in talks over a £30million move to the Premier League champions and French forward Bafetimbi Gomis is set to deputise in his absence. Gomis has also been linked with a move away from Swansea this week with several Premier League rivals reported to be interested in his services, but Monk insists his squad have been fully focused on the challenge ahead rather than being distracted by off-field matters. 'I can assure you the players are focused on West Ham - fully focused,' Monk said. 'We were always going to be without Bony in this period anyway and the players knew that. We had already planned for that. 'We will be looking to put a performance on in front of our crowd and we want to do that not just because of our recent performance against West Ham, but because we are in a good position and we want to try to push on in the second half of the season. 'The intensity has gone up in training. I have told the players that I am going to push them harder now because the second half of the season is harder than the first. 'Everyone starts to realise what they are fighting for in the league so I think it becomes harder.' Monk might have lost out to Allardyce in east London last month but he is once again looking forward to pitting his tactical wits against a manager 25 years his senior and with vast managerial experience. Striker Bafetimbi Gomis (right) has also been linked with a transfer to Crystal Palace from Swansea . 'All credit to him, Sam has shown his experience and is definitely one of the managers of the year,' Monk said. 'He has been open-minded and he has adapted and you have to give him massive credit for that. 'It's something I've looked at and it's something to bear in mind for me because he knows his stuff. 'West Ham have been fantastic this season. They have played some great football and they also have Andy Carroll, so they can play more direct if they want to.

"An artist has managed to turn the most unlikely of places into her own personal yoga studio by striking poses in the streets of the world's busiest cities. In New York, Madrid, Paris and in her native Ljubljana, Slovenia, Anja Humljan has been surprising passers-by with her flexible routines. Anja, a yoga teacher of 12 years and former top athlete, decided to embark on her scheme over the last year and has now produced a book of her work called The Urban Yoga Photo Book. Scroll down for video . Artist and yogi Anja Humljan has been creating dynamic poses in some of the world's biggest cities, New York, Madrid, Paris and Lujubljana . She worked with four photographers around the world: Jaka Vinek, in New York, Emilio P. Doiztua, in Madrid, Antoine Le Grand, in Paris and Primo Lukeic, in Ljubljana. Together they created this amazing series of photographs that make the daily commute look tame in comparison. Anja, 31, says that the project came from a desire to explore the human body's relationship with the city. 'The photos are picturing my journey as an architect and a yogi using The Urban Yoga to explore alternative ways of understanding the relationship between the urban environment and our sensuous body. The 31-year-old has posed demonstrating her strength and flexibility in New York (pictured)  Madrid, Paris and Slovenia's Ljubljana . Anja hopes to communicate the harmony between human beings and the urban environment through her gravity-defying yoga poses . Anja said that the reaction she received from passers-by varied from city to city . 'Photos were taken during the course of one year in places I worked as a freelance architect and designer: New York, Madrid, Paris and Ljubljana. 'Every city featured in The Urban Yoga photo series has a special place in my heart and shaped me as a researcher in architecture.' Anja says that the image produced was as much influenced by each of the photographers as they were by her posing. 'Choosing the location depended on the photographer, the city and the time of the year. I had been always excited to hear the ideas of the photographer and I enjoyed trying them out. Anja, who practised yoga for the photo series in a footless white leotard, chose locations where she had worked before as a freelance architect . For each pose Anja aimed to 'connect, intertwine and mimic the urban space', which in this case mean a handstand between boxes on a truck . Here Anja, who worked with four photographers, becomes part of the view from the High Line development on to New York's Tenth Avenue . 'So the final photo was a synergy between the photographer and myself. Sometimes we chose locations as we strolled through the city and sometimes in advance. 'With those chosen in advance, it sometimes happened that as we got there and tried them out we realised that they did not work at all.' When it came to deciding where and how to pose the final result was anything but random with Anja carefully considering the message she wanted to convey. Anja demonstrates her physical strength as she hangs from metal bars, here just below a basketball hoop in a heavily-graffitied environment . Anja thought long and hard about how her poses, such as sinuously dangling from scaffolding, could best convey her message of urban unity . 'As far as the poses are concerned, my aim was to connect, intertwine and mimic the urban space, so that the photos functioned as a metaphor for the fact that while moving through space, we subconsciously mimic and measure spatial configuration. 'Moreover, to invite people to surrender to urban space with their whole sensuous body and give themselves up to feelings that are running through it.' Anja added that she found it fascinating to see different reactions in the different countries she visited. 'It had been also very interesting to observe people in different cities and how they react towards the making of The Urban Yoga. 'In New York, for example, they saw it as a spectacle, stopping their cars to take pictures, making traffic congestions, clapping as we finished finished the shot. 'In Paris, on the the contrary, it seemed as if none cared at all, so it was much easier to focus. In Ljubljana, people were amazed, but, they were standing there and observing quietly.' 'In Madrid people were really helpful watching over me so I do not fall or get hurt, which was really sweet.' As well as posing outdoors, Anja also practiced some of her positions inside homes, here emerging from a large white bathtub . The images will be displayed in the Urban Yoga Book a publication that sees a collection of the artist's images . Anja says that one of her favourite places to pose was her home town in Slovenia as she had a more interactive audience. 'It was also a bit different, because it is my home town so many people we knew were passing by and together we were making jokes, which made the shooting lots of fun.' The yogi hopes that her project will help communicate her message of unity between humans and the urban landscape. 'As a yoga teacher of 12 years I based my practice on the notion that our guiding principle is to live in harmony with ourselves as well as with the environment - any environment. 'Thus, I believe urban landscape should not be regarded as something, which disturbs our harmony, but rather as a vital element that contributes to it. 'Architecture with all its constructive fields makes up the urban landscape - the city, the inescapable environment of contemporary humans. This is where The Urban Yoga steps in.' Anja's book was successfully funded on Kickstarter and should be available by the end of March.

"Manchester City are confident of agreeing a new contract with James Milner despite interest from Liverpool. The England midfielder has become an important member of the City squad and has even been deployed in a central striker role recently due to the injuries suffered by Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. And it appears the 29-year-old will remain at the Etihad beyond their 2014-15 campaign. James Milner (centre) has attracted interest from Liverpool and has yet to sign a new deal . But City remain confident that Milner, pictured scoring against Sheffield Wednesday, will sign a new deal .

"It may look like something straight from a toy store but this bizarre creature is a new species of insect found living in the South American rainforest. The 7mm-long creature is golden  and its elongated body is covered in orange dots and stripes. It has hair-like feelers sticking out of its rear which resemble the fuzzy hair of the colourful Troll Dolls, a popular toy in the 1990s. The 7mm-wide insect, pictured, was discovered after researchers from the University of Harvard trekked for three weeks to explore the untouched rainforest of southeast Suriname. The unnamed creature is covered in orange dots and stripes. Its feelers are made of wax that protrude from its rear end . Researchers believe the bug is an immature insect called a nymph, possibly fitting into one of four nymph families: . Dictyopharidae, Nogodinidae, Lophopidae, and Tropiduchidae. A nymph is an immature insect. In insects that undergo a gradual metamorphosis, the stage of the life cycle that hatches from the egg is called the nymph. These insects do not pupate like a butterfly. Often, the nymph looks like a smaller, wingless version of the adult. The nymph may molt several times to reach adulthood. Insects that undergo simple or gradual metamorphosis, and have a nymph stage, include grasshoppers and crickets, cockroaches, termites and dragonflies. Teams from the University of Harvard and . museums around the world trekked for three weeks to explore the . untouched rainforest of southeast Suriname. The new nymph was one of 60 new species recorded during the trek. Princeton's Dr Trond Larsen, who is a tropical ecologist and conservation biologist, spent days studying the creature. Dr Larsen said: 'I have spent hours searching drawers of nymphs to compare it to . other species, but have only been able to narrow it down from 16 to . four.' In insects that undergo a gradual metamorphosis, the stage of the life cycle that hatches from the egg is called the nymph. These insects do not pupate like a butterfly. The iridescent 'tail' that grows from the bottom of some nymphs is in fact made of wax. It is produced by specialised glands in the abdomen. The wax serves a variety of purposes - in some species it grows into a fan shape and can slow descent while falling. It can also act as a distraction for predators.

The international team of field biologists studied the mountainous region of southeastern Suriname - a wilderness area that has been relatively unexplored. It is among the most remote and unexplored tracts of rainforest left on Earth. Suriname is located in the Guiana Shield, a vast area of South America that contains more than 25 per cent of the world's rainforest. The country has a relatively low population and still maintains 95 per cent of its forest cover, but faces pressure from mining, road and dam projects. The scientists collected data on water quality and a total of 1,378 species, including plants, ants, beetles, katydids, fishes, amphibians, birds and mammals. Dr. Leeanne Alonso, the expedition's leader, said: 'I have conducted expeditions all over the world, but never have I seen such beautiful, pristine forests so untouched by humans. 'Southern Suriname is one of the last places on earth where there is a large expanse of pristine tropical forest. 'The high number of new species discovered is evidence of the amazing biodiversity of these forests that we have only just begun to uncover.'","The 7mm-wide, six-legged bug is thought to be an insect called a nymph .

"Humans have long been fascinated by the lizard's ability to shed and regrow its own tail. And now scientists have identified the genes that trigger new tissue growth after a lizard sacrificed its appendage to escape a predator. They believe the ‘genetic recipe’ could lead to muscle and nerve regeneration in humans. Scientists have discovered that green anole lizards (pictured)  turn on at least 326 genes to regenerate their tail and using this 'genetic recipe' they could one day work out how to grow new human tissue . Scientists from Arizona State University used gene sequencing technology to study the process in the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. ‘Lizards basically share the same toolbox of genes as humans,’ said Lead scientist Professor Kenro Kusumi. ‘Lizards are the most closely-related animals to humans that can regenerate entire appendages. Researchers at University College London (UCL) identified a biological pathway, called ERK (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), must be constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals. The discovery could help researchers unlock the ‘regenerative potential’ of cells across other animals, it was announced in June. In adult mammalian cells, the ERK pathway is not fully active. When forced to be, cells acquire a greater potential for reprogramming and regeneration. Through the ERK pathway, proteins communicate signals from a cell’s surface to the nucleus containing its genetic material. ‘While humans have limited regenerative abilities, other organisms, such as the salamander, are able to regenerate an impressive repertoire of complex structures including parts of their hearts, eyes, spinal cord, tails, and they are the only adult vertebrates able to regenerate full limbs,' said Lead scientist Dr Max Yun from UCL’s Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology. ‘We’re thrilled to have found a critical molecular pathway, the ERK pathway that determines whether an adult cell is able to be reprogrammed and help the regeneration processes. ‘Manipulating this mechanism could contribute to therapies directed at enhancing regenerative potential of human cells.’ ‘We discovered that they turn on at least 326 genes in specific regions of the regenerating tail, including genes involved in embryonic development, response to hormonal signals and wound healing.’ A number of other animals, including salamanders, tadpoles and fish, can also regenerate tails - and sometimes limbs. They all employ what is known as the ‘Wnt pathway’, which provides the molecular signals needed to control stem cells in many tissues including the brain, hair follicles and blood vessels. But lizards were found to have a unique pattern of tissue growth that is distributed throughout the tail. ‘Regeneration is not an instant process,’ said Elizabeth Hutchins, co-researcher on the study published in the journal Public Library of Science One. ‘In fact, it takes lizards more than 60 days to regenerate a functional tail. 'Lizards form a complex regenerating structure with cells growing into tissues at a number of sites along the tail.’ Professor Kusumi added: ‘Using next-generation technologies to sequence all the genes expressed during regeneration, we have unlocked the mystery of what genes are needed to regrow the lizard tail. ‘By following the genetic recipe for regeneration that is found in lizards, and then harnessing those same genes in human cells, it may be possible to regrow new cartilage, muscle or even spinal cord in the future.’ In June, scientists announced that they have worked out how salamanders grow new limbs. The discovery could one say help researchers unlock the 'regenerative potential' of human cells.

"More than 200 women and girls were raped by Sudanese soldiers in their village in North Darfur after one of the nearby garrison's men went missing. The women - including 80 schoolgirls - were subjected to the eight-hour ordeal on Friday night, just hours after the garrison's commander gave the villagers until sunset to retrieve the missing soldier. One of the elders in Tabit, near El Fasher, told Radio Dabanga they were caught by surprise when the soldiers surrounded their village at 8pm. The brutal attack on the women and girls took place in a village in north Darfur in Sudan (file picture) 'They beat the people with rifle butts and chased all of the men outside the village,' he added. 'Then they started to rape about 200 women and girls, which lasted from Friday evening until 4am on Saturday.' He said the commander came to the village on Friday morning, claiming that one of his soldiers went missing on Thursday evening, and demanding the villagers retrieve him, AllAfrica.com reported. 'They also prevented us from transferring the wounded to El Fasher city, the Unamid base, or to Shangil Tobaya,' the village elder added. The commander admitted that his men committed the mass rape and apologized to the victims for the soldiers' actions. He also acknowledged that his men had beaten and humiliated the men in Tabit. The villagers have rejected his apology. One of the Sheikhs in Tabit told Radio Dabanga that the commander arrived in Tabit on Monday morning accompanied by a lieutenant and two vehicles mounted with a heavy machine gun. The village of Tabit is located in North Darfur - one of the five states composing the Darfur region of Sudan . He said: 'The commander acknowledged that his forces 'committed a mistake' against Tabit. He explained that the soldier who went missing was found in Tawila locality.' The commander asked the villagers to record the names of the rape victims and the wounded, and to bring them to the military hospital in El Fasher. 'We refused his apology,' the Sheikh added, 'and demand the formation of an independent investigation into the crime, and to bring the perpetrators to justice.' He said that following the brutal attack no Sudanese authorities or Unamid forces came to the area. Meanwhile, a number of families from Tabit have moved to Zamzam camp for the displaced in El Fasher and others are preparing to leave the area.","Mass rape was carried out in the village of Tabit into early hours of Saturday .

"Andrew Turner, who has been the MP for the Isle of Wight for more than a decade, is facing calls to resign over revelations regarding his love life . A veteran Tory MP is facing calls to resign over revelations regarding his love life, after it emerged that his partner of 17 years had begun living with one of his closest advisers. Andrew Turner, who has been the MP for the Isle of Wight for more than a decade, has had his election campaign thrown into disarray over the complicated love triangle. The furore began after it emerged that Mr Turner, who has been the island's MP for 13 years, had moved out of the house he shared with his fiancée Carole Dennett, who was also his parliamentary assistant. But it later emerged that Nicholas Finney, who advises the MP on transport and was in the process of divorcing his wife, had instead moved into the taxpayer-funded home that Mr Turner previously shared with Ms Dennett. A few days after Christmas, Mr Turner then moved back into the house. Days later, Ms Dennett moved out with her new partner. Local Tories now fear the traditionally safe seat could be lost amid allegations Mr Turner has become a 'laughing stock' on the island. They are now calling for the politician to stand down, fearing he will be defeated in May's General Election. But Mr Turner's allies insist he will not cave in. He will launch his campaign for re-election at a press conference on Monday. A Isle of Wight Conservative Association meeting scheduled for later this month is due to debate a motion calling for Mr Turner to stand down. Denise Grannum and Edward Giles, two former chairmen, are two of the association members who have urged Mr Turner to resign. In a letter sent this week, they wrote: 'The recent revelations about your separation, and the fact that you, as the seeming ""innocent"" party, moved out of the house to let her and her new lover be there only serves to emphasise to outsiders that you are in thrall to Carole and are totally dominated by her. 'We have noted that Mr Finney appears to have an ongoing role as your transport adviser and this gives rise to question about your judgement. It also causes ambiguity about the future role of these two individuals in your office. None of this gives either the party or the public the impression that you are genuinely in charge of your work.' The furore began after it emerged Mr Turner (right) had moved out of the house he shared with his fiancée Carole Dennett (left) - who was also his parliamentary assistant - to make way for his aide, Nicholas Finney . MailOnline has tried to contact Mr Turner, but he has not responded. Last week, Mr Turner's election agent also quit, just a week before the official launch of the campaign. Mike Rooke's resignation follows that of Mr Turner's campaign manager Keith Hook who quit after less than a month. Andrew Turner's transport advisor Nick Finney has started a relationship with the MP's ex fiancee Carole Dennett . Mr Rooke said he had stepped down to help his daughter launch a cycling business in France and denied it was connected to revelations about the MP's personal life. But Keith Hook said he had been unable to work with certain people in the campaign team, the County Press reported. Separately, Mr Finney spoke to local website On The Wight about his relationship with the MP. He reportedly told the website: 'Andrew Turner's opponents are trying every possible way to harm him. 'I am sorry that my relationship with Carole is being used to try to harm Andrew, not least because he is a thoroughly decent MP who serves the Island very well and is widely respected.' The saga is the latest in a string of controversies to surround the MP. In 2009, Mr Turner claimed more than £100,00 in expenses after designating the couple's house on the island as his 'second' home. Mr Turner always insisted the claims were in line with the rules. During the scandal, it was also revealed Miss Dennett told Commons officials that she looked forward to spending his office expenses on 'lots of booze so that the forthcoming elections goes in an alcoholic blur'.","Isle of Wight MP Andrew Turner split from long-term partner Carol Dennett .

"Scans of Otzi the iceman have already given unprecedented insights into how our ancestors lived, but the latest find could be one of the most significant. Not only have researchers discovered the 5,300-year-old mummy suffered from atherosclerosis - narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits - they have found he may have been genetically predisposed to the condition. This is significant because evidence of genetic tendencies are notoriously difficult to obtain due to the degradation of remains. Following a whole-genome study of the iceman (pictured) researchers discovered he had an increased genetic risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). In particular, the iceman's genome featured several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been linked with modern-day cardiovascular disease in more recent studies . The find also highlights that despite lifestyles becoming more sedentary since Otzi was alive, genetic predisposition and risk for the condition today appears to be very similar to that in ancient times. Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty substances known as plaques or atheroma. The plaques cause affected arteries to harden and narrow, which can be dangerous as restricted blood flow can damage organs and stop them functioning properly. If a plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot. This can block the blood supply to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or it can block the blood supply to the brain, triggering a stroke. Source: NHS Choices . The research was carried out by Professor Albert Zink from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman at the European Academy of Bolzano in Italy. Following a whole-genome study of the Tyrolean iceman, a glacier mummy from the Alps, the researchers discovered he was at increased risk of coronary heart disease. In particular, the iceman's genome featured several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been linked with modern-day cardiovascular disease in more recent studies. This is of particular interest because CT scans of Otzi have already revealed major blockages in several major blood vessels, including the carotid arteries, distal aorta, and right iliac artery. This is of particular interest because computed tomography (CT) scans of Otzi (pictured) have already revealed major calcification in several major blood vessels, including the carotid arteries, distal aorta, and right iliac artery. All of which are strong signs of generalised atherosclerotic disease . Otzi (pictured) was unearthed in September 1991 by German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named. His perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a constant temperature of -6°C . The authors added that modern traditional cardiac risk factors - such as being overweight, smoking, lack of physical activity, and a high fat diet - can generally be ruled out in a person from this era. In particular, the genetic sequencing data demonstrates that Otzi had a very specific genetic mutation - namely that he was homozygous for the minor allele (GG) of rs10757274, located in chromosomal region 9p21. This is currently seen as being among the strongest genetic predictors of heart attacks, and has been confirmed in several studies as a major risk factor for heart disease. The 5,300-year-old ice mummy, known . as Otzi, suffered from the world's first-known case of Lyme disease - a . bacterial parasite spread by ticks, according to DNA analysis. Analysis also revealed Otzi was 5ft 2 inches (1.5 metres) tall, had brown . eyes, had relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant. He was unearthed in September 1991 by German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named. He was believed to have been around 46 years old when he died. The iceman has been crucial to the understanding of how prehistoric people lived, what they wore and even what they ate. The iceman's tattoos (pictured) which are largely seen on the parts of his body that endured wear-and-tear, lead archaeologists to liken the practice of tattooing to acupuncture, which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress . For example, researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat. Archaeologists believe Otzi, who was carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper axe, may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival tribe. A hole in his collarbone suggested he was killed by an arrow, then a brain scan concluded he died from a fall. But research from the European Academy of Bolzano/Bozen (EURAC) in Germany more recently discovered he suffered brain damage likely caused by a blow to the head. Researchers also believe he was arthritic and infested with whipworm, an intestinal parasite. The iceman's tattoos, which are largely seen on the parts of his body that endured wear-and-tear, lead archaeologists to liken the practice of tattooing to acupuncture, which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress. His perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a constant temperature of -6°C. Visitors can view the mummy through a small window. Alongside his remains is a new Otzi model created using 3D images of the corpse and forensic technology by two Dutch artists – Alfons and Adrie Kennis. ‘Our ancestors going back thousands of years show signs of atherosclerosis,’ said the researchers. Archaeologists believe Otzi (reconstruction pictured) who was carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper axe when he died . ‘Even though our human ancestors lived far different lives than we do, their environments and lifestyles were not protecting them against the development of atherosclerosis.’ They added: ‘What is similar between now and then is the human genetic material, our genome, were uncovered to predispose the carrier to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. ‘However, our ancient ancestors were certainly susceptible to many other conditions, such as infectious diseases, nutritional deprivation, and trauma. '[These] often resulted in death at an early age, before atherosclerotic heart disease had a clinical impact.’ Future genetic studies of ancient humans have the potential to provide more insights into the presence and possible changes of genetic risk factors in our ancestors. ‘The study of ancient humans and a better understanding of the interaction between environmental and genetic influences on the development of heart diseases may lead to a more effective prevention and treatment of the most common cause of death in the modern world,’ concluded the researchers.","The study was carried out by the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman, Italy .

"IF you’re a pessimist who thinks a leopard can’t change its spots, just read on. For researchers claim you can teach yourself to be an optimist in as little as seven weeks. And there are even more reasons to be positive: the training consists of two simple excercises. One involves looking at smiley and angry faces and the other is a 20 minute meditation exercise. Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Scroll down for the expert test . Michael Mosley has his brain activity monitored at Essex University before he embarks on two 'treatments' for pessimism. Results reveal that the right side of his brain is far more active than the left, a trait associated with anxious and neurotic people . By practising them regularly, scientists have shown the brain can change the way it works – therefore transforming a pessimist’s outlook on life. The findings were aired in a BBC documentary last night which investigated the science behind people’s personalities and whether it was possible to change them. Viewers watched as presenter Michael Mosley, who has suffered with chronic insomnia for the past 20 years, explained how he wanted to become a ‘warmer, happier person and to sleep better’. The father-of-four had his brain tested at Essex University by Professor Elaine Fox, a leading researcher into the science of optimism. The results showed he had more activity in parts of brain associated with negativity, pessimism and a strong tendency to look on the dark side of life. Research has shown that with certain mental exercises you can learn to see that the glass of life is half full . Past studies have found people who are prone to high levels of pessimism, neuroticism and anxiety suffer from ‘cerebral asymmetry’, where there is greater activity on the right side of their brain than the left. The cause of this is not yet known. By analysing electrical activity in the brain, experts were able to show that the right side of Mr Mosley’s brain was three times more active than the left when in its resting state. Professor Fox suggested Mr Mosley should undertake two forms of mental training daily. The meditation excercise involved sitting in a quiet place and focusing on physical sensations, such as the weight of his body or breathing, for 20 minutes. He met a former monk who told him about the ancient art of mindfulness, a form of meditation. The monk said said that everyone could benefit from taking ten to 20 minutes out of each day to cut off from the outside world and ‘live in the moment’. The trick was to start doing this exercise for ten minutes, then build up to 20 minutes each time. Eventually the technique enables the person to let their thoughts come and go freely without ruminating on them. The second exercise involved looking at a screen  showing 15 blank or angry faces, and one smiley face. Mr Mosley had to spot the smiling face and click on it. A new set of faces then appeared. The idea behind the excerise was to train his brain to look for positive images. By regularly doing this, it is thought the brain learns to tune into positive thoughts more easily. Michael Mosley visit a brain bank containing the brains of 3000 humans. Experts hope that by analysing the organs, they will be able to better understand the way people think . After seven weeks, Mr Mosley felt his mood lifting, he started sleeping better and felt more optimistic. He then returned to the lab to see if his brain had in fact changed. Mr Mosley was told the ‘asymmetrical’ levels of his brain activity had become more equalised – a strong indicator he had become more optimistic. In addition to this, his scores when reacting to the brain training game had changed. He reacted more quickly to happy faces and more slowly to sad faces, indicating he was not seeking out negativity as much. Dr Mosley told BBC2 programme, Horizon: The Truth about Personality: ‘I feel quite frankly astonished that you can notice that much change in just seven weeks. I set out to see if it was possible to change my mind and I think I might have done it. I am absolutely thrilled.’ Mindfulness, a form or meditation, is an ancient practice that involves focussing a person's awareness and attention but at the same time maintaining a sense . of calmness and relaxation. Try working this exercise into your routine each day for 10 minutes and slowly build up to 20 if you want to try and change your mindset.","Michael Mosley has investigated the science of personality and discovered that our outlook on life is not fixed and unchangeable .

"The Government has today revealed the top-ten most common nationalities of foreign-born women who gave birth in NHS hospitals in the last year. The new record level of births to foreign-born mothers is more than double the proportion of 20 years ago, with women originally from Poland topping the list, according to the Office for National Statistics. Other nations represented in the top ten include Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Somalia. A total of 184,000 children were born in these circumstances, with almost half of them in London, which has a foreign-born mother rate of 56.7 per cent, far above the national average of 25.5 per cent. International: Foreign-born women have children every day in the UK, reaching record levels in 2011 . According to official figures, the average hospital birth can cost £1,600, meaning the total cost to the NHS of these would have been at least £30million. Some of the women will have been born abroad and settled in the UK but a number will have visited just to use the NHS. Boom: Health tourism, including maternity care, is believed to be costing the NHS around £200 million per year . So called ‘health tourism’ as a whole is thought to cost taxpayers as much as £200million a year. Urgent . treatment, such as maternity care, is provided regardless of residence . status or ability to pay but hospitals must take reasonable measures to . recover debts from overseas patients if they can trace them. Some trusts are owed tens of millions by foreign patients and have been forced to write-off some of these debts. It came as it was also announced that net migration to the UK is still at 216,000 a year, which is still double the Government's 100,000 target. This means that means hundreds of thousands more people every year are coming to the UK when compared to numbers who leave. Meanwhile the number of foreign-born mothers is rising consistently annually, with the figures now double what they were 30 years ago. Figures . compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that a 25.5 . per cent of all children born in 2011 had foreign-born mothers, . compared with 25.1 per cent the year before. More . than 20,000 were from Poland, followed by 18,000 from Pakistan, almost . 15,000 from Indian and and more than 8,000 from Bangladesh. It . is the highest proportion of births to non-UK born mothers since . parents' country of origin was introduced in birth registration in 1969. Growth: Figures revealed today show that the number of foreign mothers giving birth in England and Wales has reached record levels . Arrivals: Official statistics show net migration is down . In Newham, east London, more than three quarters of new mums were born outside the UK but choose to give birth here. The . ONS found that a slight rise of 0.1 per cent in the overall number of . newborn children compared with 2010 was entirely due to foreign-born . mothers. Women born in . the UK had 1,957 fewer babies in 2011 compared with the previous year, . in a reversal of rising numbers of births to UK-born women since 2002. Meanwhile mothers born outside the UK . had 2,702 more babies, in line with a trend since 1995 for the number of . births to women who came to the UK from abroad to rise year-on-year. The ONS said: 'This is the highest proportion of births to mothers born outside the UK since the collection of parents' country of birth was introduced at birth registration in 1969. 'This proportion has increased every year since 1990, when it was just under 12 per cent, with a marked rise over the last decade. In 2001 the proportion of births to non-UK born mothers was 16.5 per cent.' It added: 'The slight fall in the number of births to UK born women is a reversal of the previous trend of rising numbers of births to UK women since 2002. In contrast, the number of births to women born outside the UK has risen every year since 1995.' Dr Martin Ruhs, director of the . Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the estimated . figures were based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS) and . margins of error meant they could be 35,000 higher or lower than stated. Regions: The highest number of births last year involved mothers from the Middle East and Asia followed by the EU . So while net migration was put at 216,000 for last year, this was the . central estimate for the figure which could range from 181,000 to . 251,000, meaning that the apparent drop is not statistically . significant. 'There is a constant desire among policy makers in all parties, the . press and other interest groups in having 'hard' facts and specific . numbers about migration, but the reality is that sometimes these are . simply not available,' Dr Ruhs said. 'The uncertainty around the official migration estimates means that the . figures need to be used and interpreted with great care.' Nigerian-born Bimbo Ayelabola, 33, . right, travelled to Britain to give birth to quins at a cost of up to . £200,000 to British taxpayers. The . wife of a wealthy businessman had two boys and three girls by Caesarean . section in April last year and was in Homerton Hospital, East London, . for almost two weeks. Mrs . Ayelabola, from Lagos, who had been taking a fertility drug, said at the . time: ‘I had already had miscarriages and couldn’t bear the stress . another pregnancy would cause. So I decided to visit my family in . London. ‘I thought I would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family.’ Mrs . Ayelabola claimed her husband left her and returned to Nigeria after . discovering she had given birth to five babies.

"Pirates attacked an oil supply vessel off the Nigerian coast and kidnapped the captain and chief engineer, both U.S. citizens, an American defense official and security sources said on Thursday. Pirate attacks off Nigeria's coast have jumped by a third this year as ships passing through West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, a major commodities route, have come under threat from gangs wanting to snatch cargoes and crews. The U.S.-flagged, C-Retriever, a 222-foot (67 meter) vessel owned by U.S. marine transport group Edison Chouest Offshore, was attacked early Wednesday, UK-based security firm AKE and two security sources said. The company was not immediately available for comment. Scroll down for video . The C-Retriever was attacked off the coast of Nigeria. Pictured is another ship owned by Edison Chouest Offshore . A U.S. defense official said the State Department and FBI were leading the American response to the incident. A second defense official said the U.S. Marine Corps has a small training unit in the region but it was not clear if it would get involved. U.S. Navy officials have grown increasingly concerned about piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea and are working with local authorities there to strengthen their ability to patrol the region and better share information. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus called the region a potential 'hot spot' after a visit to four countries surrounding the gulf in August. He told Defense News in September the Navy was working closely with Gabon, Senegal, Sao Tome and Ghana to help fight an increase in illegal trafficking of drugs, people and arms.

The U.S.-flagged C-Retriever is owned by U.S. marine transport group Edison Chouest Offshore . 'The piracy threat is spreading even further through the waters of West Africa, and the attacks have been mounting, even as global rates of reported piracy are at their lowest since 2006,' said Michael Frodl of U.S.-based consultancy C-Level Maritime Risks. Unlike the dangerous waters off Somalia and the Horn of Africa on the east coast of Africa, through which ships now speed with armed guards on board, many vessels have to anchor to do business off West African countries, with little protection. This makes them a target for criminals and jacks up insurance costs. Kidnapped sailors and oil workers taken in Nigerian waters are usually released after a ransom is paid. In a separate incident, three Nigerian soldiers were killed on Tuesday when armed robbers attacked a vessel carrying construction workers in the creeks of oil-producing Rivers state, the army said on Thursday.","The 222-foot U.S flagged C-Retriever was stormed on Wednesday .

"Staff Sgt. Luis Walker was sentenced to 20 years in prison Saturday for crimes that included rape and sexual assault. He is among 12 instructors investigated for sexual misconduct toward at least 31 female trainees at one of the nation's busiest military training centers. Prosecutors say he used his position as a military trainer at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio to gain female recruits' trust, and then he made illicit sexual advances. Walker's court-martial included testimony from 10 women, one of whom wept as she described him luring her into his base office and sexually assaulting her on a bed, ignoring her pleas to stop. Walker showed little emotion as the sentence was read, but he appeared to have tears on his face later as he gazed at his wife, Yeimi. Both had cried earlier, while asking the military jury for leniency and a shorter sentence so that he would be able to spend time with his two sons, ages 7 and 4. Guilty: Air Force Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, seen arriving at his trial Friday, was convicted of all 28 counts he faced and was sentenced today to 20 years in prison . Sentencing: Walker, seen in a July 16 photo, showed little emotion as the sentence was read, but he appeared to have tears on his face later as he gazed at his wife, Yeimi . 'I ask for my family's sake, for my two boys right there,' Walker said, wheeling around to look at the youngsters, who sat squirming and chattering back and forth with no understanding of the proceedings. 'I ask that I am allowed to have a future with them.' Walker's stepfather, sister and wife all testified on his behalf, describing an earnest teen who grew up in a tough corner of Brooklyn, dreamed of joining the Air Force from the age of 14 and arranged to graduate from high school early so he could enlist. 'All of his dreams are shattered and our dreams because I was so proud of him,' said Herbert O'Connor, Walker's stepfather. Walker was taken after the hearing to a temporary lockup at Lackland to await transfer to a permanent prison. The six men and woman who served on the military jury are barred from discussing their deliberations so it's impossible to know if the testimony swayed. But the victims' testimony was equally as emotional. Five spoke during sentencing, including four who are still in the service. 'In Afghanistan, I was a little bit more scared of everything,' said one, who said Walker sexually assaulted her last year, while she was a trainee at Lackland. 'I couldn't work with certain individuals,' she added, 'just since they remind me of Staff Sgt. Walker.' Prosecutors say Walker sexually assaulted or had improper sexual or personal contact with at least 10 female recruits from October 2010 through January 2011. The Associated Press does not usually identify victims of sexually assault. The same victim said her 15-year-old sister talked about joining the Air Force, and 'I've absolutely told her she's not allowed anywhere near' it. Other victims said they had the same advice for female relatives and friends. 'I don't enjoy the military anymore,' one said. 'I don't want to be in it.' Another victim spoke of being unable to sleep at night 'because I somehow feel he terrifies me.' That victim also said the trauma she felt from the assault continued to plague her after she left the military. It's gotten to where I had anger issues even at work,' she said. 'If anyone makes even the slightest sexual reference, I go off. I have zero self-control.' Busy: Lackland is where every American airman receives basic training and has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year . Lackland is where all Air Force recruits go through basic training. It has about 475 instructors for about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year.

While the alleged sexual misconduct among instructors at the base apparently began in 2009, the first woman didn't come forward until last year.

It has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. About one in five is female, pushed through eight weeks of basic training by a group of instructors, 90 percent of whom are men. The sexual misconduct at the base apparently began in 2009, but the first woman didn't come forward until last year. The first allegations were levied against Walker, who is accused of crimes that allegedly took place between October 2010 and January 2011. According to prosecutors, Walker had sexual intercourse with 4 of the 10 female recruits. He was also accused of making flirtatious or sexually suggestive comments, sending inappropriate text messages and sometimes groping his recruits. Walker also is accused of forcing five recruits to engage in sexual acts by threatening their military careers and intimidating two of the women into lying about his alleged misconduct, prosecutors alleged. Several of Walker's alleged victims testified during his court-martial, including one airman who described how Walker lured her into an office and sexually assaulted her on a bed, ignoring her pleas to stop. The women told jurors that Walker gained their trust to get them alone in his office or an empty dormitory where he forced them into kissing, touching and intercourse. Those testifying said they didn't tell anybody at first because they feared being booted from the Air Force. Last arrival: Air Force Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, right,  arrives for the fourth day of his trial at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas . The Associated Press is not naming those who testified because they are alleged sexual assault victims. Meanwhile, the case of another former Air Force training instructor has been referred to a general court-martial, according to an Air Force statement issued Friday evening. Staff Sgt. Craig LeBlanc is charged with sexual misconduct, obstructing justice and making a false official statement. He is accused of using his post as a military instructor to sexually assault and pursue a sexual relationship with one female trainee, and have a wrongful sexual relationship with another. No trial date has been set. One of the other instructors charged in the case, Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado, pleaded guilty in June, admitting he had sex with a female trainee in exchange for a sentence of 90 days' confinement. He later acknowledged he had been involved with a total of 10 trainees - a number previously unknown to investigators.","Lackland Air Force Base instructor Luis Walker found guilty on all 28 counts .

News of his passing came as a complete surprise,' Kraft said. 'It is another reminder that we can’t take anything for granted. Be sure to give your loved ones hugs and kisses and tell them how much you love them. My heart aches for his parents, Scott and Leslie, his aunt Audrey and the rest of Sam’s extended family.

An Eagle Scout, he participated in marching band and baseball, ESPN reports. Kraft became involved in Berns' life after reading about him in a local newspaper and invited him to a Saturday practice this past September, the website adds. Kraft, so touched by the boy's condition, introduced Berns to the entire Patriots team. He reportedly even served as motivation for the team in its September 30-23 win against the Atlanta Falcons, NBC Sports reports. 'I asked Sam if he would be kind enough to give the team a little pep talk and tell them what they needed to do to get a win down in Atlanta,' Kraft told Patriots.com. 'He started telling them what they had to do to move [Falcons quarterback] Matt Ryan off the spot and get him to throw a few interceptions and how we could score.' Berns is believed to have also touched the heart of quarterback Tom Brady. 'Brady was determined to be the player of the game down in Atlanta for Sam,' Kraft told the website. 'NBC gives a ball to the player who was most outstanding in the game and when I told Tom I was seeing Sam again, he pulled that game ball out of his locker, gave it to me and said, ""I think Sam should have it.""' Berns later invited Kraft to a screening of  'Life According to Sam' in October. Kraft eventually donated $500,000 to the Progeria Research Foundation, according to ESPN.

"George Lucas has axed plans for a sprawling film studio on farmland north of San Francisco because he doesn't want his company to be seen as 'an evil empire.' Lucasfilm, the force behind the Star Wars franchise, surprised officials in Marin County by pulling the plug on the controversial Grady Ranch project citing bitter opposition from neighbours and delays in the approval process. The axed plans included a 269,000-sq . ft digital media studio, a 51-ft tall mission-style . compound with two 85-ft towers, two indoor sound stages and an . outdoor stage of nearly 7,000 sq ft. There would have been screening . rooms, guest housing, a general store, employee cafeteria and wine cave . for private tastings and storage at the venue about 15 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge. Axed: An artist's impression shows the now axed plans for a sprawling studio in Marin County, near San Francisco, California, which would have created hundreds of jobs . Moving on: George Lucas' company Lucasfilm said in a statement that it had withdrawn the plans because it wished to be seen as a 'creative asset, not as an evil empire' Lucasfilm and its backers argued the . new production studio would generate hundreds of high-paying jobs and . tax revenue and hoped to break new ground next year. But yesterday they decided to withdraw from the 25-year battle. 'We love working and living in . Marin, but the residents of Lucas Valley have fought this project for 25 . years, and enough is enough,' the company said in a statement. 'We have several opportunities to . build the production stages in communities that see us as a creative . asset, not as an evil empire.' The company said it would construct . new facilities elsewhere and hoped to sell the historic farmland to a . developer interested in building low-income housing in the region. Local business leaders who championed the project said they were devastated by the announcement. 'It sends a very disturbing message . to any company thinking about growing or starting in Marin,' said . Cynthia Murray, president of the North Bay Leadership Council. 'It's a . model project. If this project can't get approved, I don't know what . project can get approved.' The Grady Ranch project would have marked a major expansion of Lucasfilm in Lucas Valley, which has been home to its Skywalker Ranch for three decades - the valley is named after a 19th century rancher with no relation to the Star Wars creator. But the project generated strong opposition from homeowners and environmentalists who said it would increase traffic, noise and environmental damage on the pristine countryside, despite company promises to preserve open space and reduce impacts on the community. The Marin County planning commission unanimously approved the studio project in February, but opponents appealed that decision to the county Board of Supervisors last month, leading to further delays. Picturesque: Campaigners against the project said it would have an adverse effect on the stunning Lucas Valley landscape by creating more traffic, noise and environmental damage . Pristine countryside: The Grady Ranch project would have nestled in Lucas Valley, in Marin County, California, about 15 miles north of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge . 'The level of bitterness and anger expressed by the homeowners in Lucas Valley has convinced us that, even if we were to spend more time and acquire the necessary approvals, we would not be able to maintain a constructive relationship with our neighbours,' Lucasfilm said in the statement. Liz Dale, president of the Lucas Valley Estates Homeowners Association, said she was surprised by the decision. 'We are glad we don't have to worry about the potential impacts we were worried about,' she said. 'We don't want to describe it as good news or bad news, but I can understand why another location would be better for this type of facility.' Dale said any proposed housing development on the property would have to be 'suited to the zoning, the people who live here and the people who come here.'Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynne Hale said two cities have contacted the company offering 'substantial incentives' to build the new studio, but she could not discuss specific locations. 'It makes me sad that we cannot build the studio in Marin,' Hale said. 'Other communities understand the economic and educational benefits of having a company such as Lucasfilm in their cities.'","Battle between Lucasfilm and locals in Marin County, California has raged for 25 years .

"'Not suicide': Candice Cohen-Ahnine, pictured with her daughter Aya, told relatives she felt threatened before she fell to her death in Paris . A mother who was involved in a bitter child custody battle with a Saudi prince she met in London has plunged to her death from a luxury apartment block. Candice Cohen-Ahnine, 35, had told relatives 'I feel threatened' in the days before she fell from the fourth floor of the complex off the Champs Elysees in Paris. Suicide has been ruled out, prompting fears that the tragedy may be connected to her dispute with Sattam al-Saud, a member of the hugely wealthy Saudi royal family. The prince separated from Miss Cohen-Ahnine six years ago after an on-off relationship during which he had only allowed her fleeting meetings with their now 10-year-old daughter, Aya. Miss Cohen-Ahnine was awarded custody of Aya by a French court earlier this year, but the prince had failed to hand over the girl before the mother died. Miss Cohen-Ahnine had been due to visit her daughter in Saudi Arabia next month. Today it emerged that Ms Cohen-Ahnine, a Frenchwoman whose original Jewish faith always caused tensions with the Muslim Saudis even after she converted, had complained of threats shortly before she died. Police were reportedly investigating the theory that the woman fell while trying to get out of her flat 'as if she was escaping something dangerous'. ‘Candice’s custody battle with the Saudis was becoming increasingly bitter, but she was determined to get Aya back,’ said a source close to the police investigation into her death, which happened on Thursday. Death fall: Miss Cohen-Ahnine, 35, plunged from the fourth floor of a luxury apartment block off the Champs Elysees in Paris . ‘A relative has confirmed that she complained of being threatened over the past few days.’ The . claim was backed by Ms Cohen-Ahnine’s French lawyer, Laurence . Tarquiny-Charpentier, who said: ‘What I can tell you is that it was not . suicide'. The lawyer added: 'She was a woman who was a real fighter and a very positive person, and plus, there were plans to see Aya in mid-September. 'That was her greatest motivation of all.' Miss Cohen-Ahnine met the Saudi prince in 1998 at Browns nightclub in London, and their daughter was born in November 2001. Estranged: Candice Cohen-Ahnine and Prince Sattam al-Saud, pictured early in their relationship. The couple met in London in 1998 and had their daughter in 2001, but they later became involved in an increasingly bitter custody battle . But the relationship broke down after . Sattam al-Saud said he was obliged to marry a cousin in 2006, and Miss . Cohen-Ahnine refused to be his second wife. Relations became even more acrimonious in 2008 after Miss Cohen-Ahnine agreed to visit the Saudi capital Riyadh with her daughter. Miss Cohen-Ahnine alleged that they were locked up in a palace and that she was also accused of being a Muslim convert from Judaism – a crime punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. Miss Cohen-Ahnine was able to escape to the French embassy after a maid left her door open, and she eventually returned to France. However, Aya remained in Saudi Arabia and Miss Cohen-Ahnine went on to express worry about her upbringing when she came across Facebook images of the girl wearing a niqab and playing with guns. Worrying: Miss Cohen-Ahnine became increasingly concerned about her daughter's upbringing after finding a picture on Facebook of the girl playing with guns . Miss Cohen-Ahnine wrote about her incarceration in a book called Give My Daughter Back, published last year. She claimed she was locked in a room without any soap to wash with. She . said she was given rotten food and no drinking water, adding: 'When Aya . managed to escape from her room to bring me a piece of bread or a bit . of toothpaste, she was hit in front of me.' In January a Paris criminal court ordered Sattam al-Saud to hand Aya back and pay child custody of some £8,000 a month. Defiant: Prince Sattam al-Saud (left) failed to comply with a French court ruling which ordered him to hand his daughter Aya back to her mother. A picture of the girl wearing a niqab (right) was posted on Facebook . The prince, who faced an . international arrest warrant for ignoring the custody terms, denied he . had ever ‘kidnapped’ his own daughter, saying: ‘She was free to come and . go as she pleased.’ However, after the hearing, the . prince was reported to have told Nouvel Observateur magazine: 'If need . be, I’ll go like [Osama] bin Laden and hide in the mountains with Aya.' He added before Miss Cohen-Ahnine’s death: ‘France has not got a right to take her back. 1998: Prince Sattam al-Saud and Candice Cohen-Ahnine meet in Browns nightclub in London. They begin an on-off relationship. 2001: Their daughter, Aya, is born. 2006: The couple break up after the prince claims he must marry a cousin and Miss Cohen-Ahnine refuses to be his second wife. 2008: Miss Cohen-Ahnine and Aya visit the Saudi capital Riyadh, where the mother claims they are locked up in a palace.

They cannot oblige a princess to leave this country.’ Miss Cohen-Ahnine died from her injuries at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris after the fall in the Rue Chambiges. Initial . investigations by the Paris prosecutor suggest that she had been trying . to get into a neighbouring flat through an open window – suggesting she . had been trying to escape. Witnesses heard the drama, but did not intervene, a police source added, with Ms Tarquiny-Charpentier saying he spoke to Miss Cohen-Ahnine ‘a few hours’ before and ‘she was fine’. She had been due to travel to Riyadh in September, and was likely to have had her daughter back ‘within a month’, added Ms Tarquiny-Charpentier. Autopsy results will be released later this week, and they may throw further light on exactly what happened. Aya, meanwhile, remains in Saudi Arabia with her father, who is yet to comment on Ms Cohen-Ahnine’s death. Jean-Claude Elfassi, who co-wrote Miss Cohen-Ahnine's book, wrote an online tribute to her and criticised the French authorities for failing to enforce the court order. He wrote: 'I can only express my disgust at the slow pace of the judge in charge of his case that, three years after the commencement of the trial, has not yet issued an arrest warrant against... Prince Saud al Sattam.'

"The Great Recession shrank Americans' wealth so much that in 2010 median family net worth was no more than it was in 1992 after adjusting for inflation, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. Median net worth declined from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010, a Fed survey of family finances found. The median marks the point where half had more and half had less. The recession officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Net worth is the value of assets like homes, bank accounts and stocks, minus debts like mortgages and credit cards. Decline: Median household wealth dropped dramatically between the 2007 and 2010 surveys, which are conducted every three years . Staying put: The Fed also found that social mobility also dropped, with more people falling into lower income brackets than rising to higher ones . The Fed's findings are in its latest Survey of Consumer Finances, a comprehensive review of household finances that the Fed has done every three years dating to 1989. 'It’s hard to overstate how serious . the collapse in the economy was,' Mark Zandi, chief economist for . Moody’s Analytics, told the Washington Post. 'We were in freefall.' The Fed's survey of consumer finances contains information only through 2010. A separate survey the Fed released last week showed that total family net worth climbed 4.7 percent in the January-March quarter to $62.9 trillion, about 28 percent above its recession low. The increase was fueled by stock market gains. A slump at home: Most of the losses in wealth were due to the dramatic decline of house prices as a result of the housing bubble bursting . The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, which has been conducted every three years since 1989, shows that the wealth of American households rose sharply in 2007, but then dropped even more dramatically in 2010 after the recession hit. The figures below are adjusted for 2010 inflation. Those gains put net worth about 5 . percent below its pre-recession peak of $66 trillion. But since the . first quarter ended, lower stock prices have eroded some household . wealth. The Fed's more . detailed Survey of Consumer Finances is done every three years. The . latest survey showed Monday that much of the drop in net worth from 2007 . to 2010 reflected the collapse of the housing market, which drove down . home values. The average family worth, nearly $500,000, is much higher because it reflects the huge wealth of a few of America's super-wealthy households. Among families that owned homes, the Fed survey found that their median home equity declined from $95,300 in 2007 to $55,000 in 2010, a drop of 42.3 percent. Home equity is the home's value minus how much is owed on the mortgage. The Fed survey found that median incomes fell from $49,600 in 2007 to $45,800 in 2010, a drop of 7.7 percent. The Fed survey found that the proportion of families carrying a credit card balance fell to 39.4 percent in 2010. That was down 6.7 percentage points from 2007. Among families with a credit card balance, the median balance fell from $3,100 in 2007 to $2,600 in 2010, a drop of 16.1 percent. The proportion of families with debt that had a debt payment that was late by 60 or more days during 2010 rose to 10.8 percent, up from 7.1 percent in 2007.","A Federal Reserve survey found median family net worth fell from $126,000 in 2007 to just $77,000 in 2010 .
The collapse of the housing bubble, which sent home prices plummeting, was the biggest reason for the decline in wealth ."
"David Cameron enraged Tory rebels last night by striking a late deal with Labour to prevent his own MPs wrecking gay marriage legislation. The Prime Minister backed Labour’s calls for an immediate consultation on the future of civil partnerships once gay marriages are legalised. This could either lead to them being extended to heterosexual couples or scrapped totally. Scroll down for video . Concerns: Prime Minister David Cameron had faced warnings that the Tory party was at risk of tearing itself apart over gay marriage and Europe . Despite the opposition of half the . Tory backbenchers, the 11th-hour deal, a humiliation for the PM, means . same-sex marriages could take place next summer. Mr Cameron’s reliance on Labour to force the measure through highlighted his divisions with his backbenchers. Gay marriage has become the latest in a series of issues sparking friction between the PM and traditionalist Tories. The legislation had looked to be in . serious trouble yesterday as Labour threatened to vote to introduce . civil partnerships for straight couples as well – a move which critics . said could cost the Exchequer £4billion by extending pension rights and . inheritance tax breaks. Tory rebels were backing the move in an attempt to wreck the entire Bill. But the Government, which had . previously suggested it would review civil partnerships within five . years, headed off a potential defeat by agreeing to a consultation . immediately. Sources said the review would be ‘very thorough and very, very long’. In the Commons, Tory splits were . highlighted by a clash between Sir Gerald Howarth and Margot James, the . Tories’ only openly gay woman MP. Miss James, welcoming the legislation, . said many gay people had suffered abuse and anti-discrimination . legislation was needed to protect them. But Sir Gerald replied: ‘I fear that . the playing field has not been levelled. I believe that the pendulum is . now swinging so far the other way and there are plenty in the aggressive . homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something . even further.’ Pleased: Margot James, the Tories' only openly gay woman MP, said many gay people had suffered abuse and anti-discrimination legislation was needed to protect them . Veteran Tory Edward Leigh protested: . ‘If you dare disagree with the orthodoxy that gay marriage is the best . thing since sliced bread, you are breaking a new taboo.’ He suggested that the ‘outlandish views of the loony left of the 1980s have now become embedded in high places’. ‘What the Government is refusing to . recognise is that they are not legislating this Bill to redefine . marriage in a vacuum. 'If you dare disagree with the orthodoxy that gay marriage is the best thing since sliced bread, you are breaking a new taboo' Edward Leigh, veteran Tory . 'They are legislating in a culture which has been . so coloured by political correctness that mild-mannered people . expressing reasonable beliefs in moderate tones are treated like . villains,’ he added. Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, . revealed that Labour would withdraw its support from the amendment . tabled by Tory opponents of gay marriage. She said: ‘We know David . Cameron’s leadership is too weak to be able to push this through and to . be able to get support on his own benches. 'We think that is a serious . problem. But also we don’t want to see gay couples who are desperate to . set the date and get married at the mercy of this Tory infighting.’ Last night Cabinet ministers Iain . Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson voted with the rebels who were calling . for registrars to opt-out of performing same sex marriages. Mrs and Mrs: Cards supporting same-sex marriage on sale yesterday in a shop in Soho, central London. Gay marriage has become the latest in a series of issues sparking friction between the PM and traditionalist Tories . The change . was rejected by a majority of 190 but attracted the support of 150. Tory MP David Burrowes warned the . legislation would become a charter for unfair dismissal of opponents and . said it would unleash a ‘chill wind’ for those who back  ‘traditional . marriage’. 'We know David Cameron’s leadership is too weak to be able to push this through and to be able to get support on his own benches' Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary . In a second vote, 148 MPs supported an . amendment to protect the religious beliefs of a person who believes . that marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman. 349 MPs . voted against, meaning it was defeated by 201 votes. In a third vote, 163 MPs  supported an . amendment to  protect those who opposed gay marriage from . discrimination. But 321 MPs voted against, meaning it was defeated by . 158 votes. A group of more than 30 current and . former local party chairmen has written to the Prime Minister to warn . him the legislation will drive Tory voters to UKIP. Bob Woollard, . chairman of the Conservative Grassroots group, said: ‘Same-sex marriage . is really a tipping point – a bellwether issue if you like. People have . just said, “I’ve had enough, I’m off, I will never vote Conservative . again”.’ A YouGov poll says 54 per cent support . same-sex marriage, but revealed a deep generational split.

"Ask Rio Ferdinand who the next England manager should be and he will tell you that the search should start and end with Glenn Hoddle. Nearly 16 years have passed since Hoddle’s last game as England’s head coach, a 2-0 win over the Czech Republic at Wembley in a friendly in November 1998. On Tuesday the pair were reunited when Hoddle accepted a bolt-from-the-blue offer to become Harry Redknapp’s first team coach at QPR. Bolt from the blue: Glenn Hoddle accepted the offer to become Harry Redknapp's first-team coach at QPR . Redknapp wants to play the in-vogue 3-5-2 formation, casting Ferdinand in the role of sweeper and using Clint Hill and Steven Caulker to stabilise his defence. If it works - and safety in the Barclays Premier League will be the measure of its success - then you can expect some momentum for Hoddle’s return to the national team. Football really is that fickle. This is a fascinating appointment because Hoddle - as a man and as a manager - divides opinion. He is not an easy man to get along with. His last coaching appointment was in 2004, an unsuccessful spell at Wolves that lasted less than two years. He has been off the training field a long time now. ‘The game has moved on since the last time Glenn was a manager,’ was Tim Sherwood response to Hoddle’s criticism of his Tottenham team from the television studio last season. They have never seen eye-to-eye, a legacy from Hoddle’s spell as Spurs manager when Sherwood’s playing days were coming to an end. Sherwood is not alone in his assessment. With the national team, Hoddle made some catastrophic decisions as head coach. One of them, over his comments about the after-life, led to his resignation in February 1999. Those with even deeper memories will recall his book - Glenn Hoddle: My World Cup story - spilling the guts on England’s dressing room secrets at France 98. As a result, he lost the trust of his players. Believer: Rio Ferdinand thinks Hoddle should be England boss, as he was here in 1998 . Highs and lows: Hoddle after England drew 0-0 in Rome in 1997 (left) and his final match vs the Czech Republic . Swindon Town 1991-1993 . Played 115 Won 49 Drew 32 Lost 34 . Chelsea 1993-1996 .

P 76 W 27 D 34 L 15 . More recently Gary Neville, who is now England’s assistant manager, questioned his methods and ability to manage a dressing room in his own autobiography, RED. According to Neville, England’s head coach used to touch players on the heart in the dressing room before matches and asked the backroom team to walk around the pitch ‘anti-clockwise’ when they played Argentina at France 98 to create positive energy. Sounds bonkers. Neville, though, does go on to say that Hoddle ‘undoubtedly’ wanted England to play the right way but questioned whether that he had ‘the man-management skills to go with his football intelligence’. Society demands a second chance, an opportunity to rectify mistakes from the past. This, unquestionably, is Hoddle’s. Ferdinand, who played in Hoddle’s last game as England’s head coach, believes he possesses one of the finest tactical minds in the game. Long spell out: Hoddle has not coached in English football since his tenure at Wolves ended in 2006 . That is a select grouping, one that includes some coaching greats such as Rinus Michel, Miguel Munoz and Bob Paisley. The former Manchester United defender, who played and trained under Terry Venables, Kevin Keegan, Sven Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello with the national team, is convinced Hoddle belongs in the elite category. On the training field, Ferdinand will tell you that Hoddle has an eye for detail and the intuition to solve problems before his players have even seen them. If true, that is a unique skill. In the Louis van Gaal era, we are witnessing a massive change in the landscape of English football. There is endless talk about tactics, systems and team shape now that the fabled Dutch coach has arrived at Manchester United with his salt and pepper pots. Sweeping statement: Ferdinand will be the 'libero' at QPR, as Hoddle (right) was at Swindon . New era: Louis van Gaal is using the same 3-5-2 formation Hoddle and Redknapp will attempt to implement at QPR . It is there, at Old Trafford, where van Gaal intends to play a variation of 3-5-2 this season. Redknapp wants to do the same. Hoddle didn’t reinvent the wheel when he became manager of Swindon in 1991, his first coaching appointment, but it was certainly brave to play with a libero in the old Second Division. He put himself there, the launchpad for Swindon’s attacks as they progressed to the play-off final, where he scored the opening goal in a 4-3 victory over Leicester, in his second full season. Paul Bodin, Colin Calderwood, John Moncur and former Tottenham midfielder Micky Hazard, who came on as a substitute at Wembley, were in the victorious Swindon team. He went on to sign the great Ruud Gullit in 1995 when  manager of Chelsea, converting the former AC Milan forward into a libero, with mixed results, towards the end of his career. It is 21 years since he started work at Chelsea’s old Harlington training centre after succeeding Dave Webb as their manager. Now he is returning to work there, this time as QPR’s first team coach as he attempts to rebuild his career at the very highest level. At the age of 56 there is time for Hoddle to make an impression and fulfil the ambition he once showed as a promising young coach. If it works out, it will only be a matter of time before he becomes an option for the national team.","Glenn Hoddle has joined the coaching staff at Queen's Park Rangers .

"After it went out of fashion at the end of the 19th century, it seemed taxidermy  was dead and buried. Other than in the Natural History Museum and the living rooms of pet-lovers who could not quite let go when their animal died, it was no longer in fashion. But now a new breed of have-a-go animal-stuffers have tried their hand at the old art - and the end products range from the bizarre to the downright scary. Is it a bird? Is it a rabbit? Erm, it is sort of both. This bizarre creation is just one of the strange attempts at taxidermy in Kat Su's Crappy Taxidermy book and blog . Not a piggy bank: This odd-looking brown, fluffy bear, which features in Ms Su's book and blog, got the taxidermy treatment but had a coin slot added on afterwards . Mutant winged rabbits, owls with googly eyes and bears with money holes were all found by New York writer Kat Su when she looked for tasteful taxidermy to decorate her home. The awful animals led her to start a hilarious blog - crappytaxidermy.com - where she documents all the terrible attempts at taxidermy she can find. The blog is now in its fifth year and the Crappy Taxidermy Facebook page has more than 10,000 likes. Ms Su has even written a book on the strange stuffed creatures, Crap Taxidermy, which showcases her discoveries. Twit twoo: An amateur's attempt at stuffing this owl seemed to be going well... until the not-so realistic googly eyes were added on to its chirpy face . Superman or mouse: This rodent, which looks like it might function well as a pencil case, can be unzipped to reveal a blue Superman shirt under its white, smooth fur . Ms Su told the Daily Mirror that she made the book and blog so people could enjoy other people's creations, rather than to make fun of them. She said: 'The book is a celebration of crappy taxidermy and the eccentric and amazing people who create it. 'It isn't meant to be disparaging.

"Six months since affair with biographer was revealed . Former general easing back into public life with charity work . Petraeus will also become a visiting professor at NY school . Just six months after resigning as director of the CIA, David Petraeus is returning to the public eye. Once a national hero for saving the United States from humiliation during his 2007-2008 stint as the commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Petraeus resigned as CIA director in disgrace in November after revealing an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell. The affair that doomed his career in government began when Broadwell was researching and writing a book titled 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,' which Rolling Stone referred to as 'slobberific' and 'so one-sided that it is almost supernaturally dull.' Scroll down for video... Out in public: Petraeus worked out on Venice Beach with veterans last month . Laying low: David Petraeus resigned from the Central Intelligence Agency in November . Petraeus resigned as CIA director after the FBI learned of his affair with Broadwell. In what is being seen as a return to public life, Petraeus will serve as a visiting . professor of public policy at CUNY's Macaulay Honors College. His . employment begins on the 1st August. Mr. Petraeus, a highly decorated . four-star general who commanded the coalition forces in Afghanistan and . Iraq, is far better known for his accomplishments on foreign . battlefields than for his time in classrooms, but he graduated in the . top 5 percent of his class at the United States Military Academy. There is a long, bipartisan tradition in American politics of sexual indiscretion followed by redemption. Recently a number of former high-profile individuals have been attempting to make a comeback. There’s Mark Sanford, running for Congress in South Carolina after an affair during his term as governor. There’s also former N.Y. congressman Anthony Weiner, best known for the lewd tweets he sent, who has been testing the waters recently as a candidate for mayor of New York. He is even back on Twitter. Petraeus will likely have the easiest time of the three. He was a widely respected general whose affair may have hurt his family and his career, but he did not lie about it and resigned immediately when it came to light. According to Buzzfeed people around Petraeus say he's been thinking hard about how to manage his comeback, his image, and his new role outside national security. Petraeus has always been famous both for his intelligence and for his ability to manage the press, and he has signaled that he has thought hard about his predicament. Petraeus met Broadwell when she was a graduate student at Harvard University and working on a dissertation about him . Still together: David Petraeus stands alongside his wife Holly during his swearing in ceremony as the new CIA Director in September 2011. The couple are still married . Although Petraeus is better known for his accomplishments the battlefield, he graduated in the top five percent of his class at military academy . Last month he made a speech at the University of Southern California where he apologized to those he'd hurt with his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 'I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago,' he said. 'I know that I can never fully assuage the pain that I inflicted on those closest to me and on a number of others,' Petraeus said, according to news reports. 'I can, however, try to move forward in a manner that is consistent with the values to which I subscribed before slipping my moorings and, as best as possible, to make amends to those I have hurt and let down' He has signaled he’s ready to move on: 'One learns after all that life doesn't stop with such a mistake. It can and must go on.' He is also dealing with a lingering investigation as to whether he inappropriately shared secret documents with Broadwell. FBI agents reportedly visited his home earlier this month. The former Iraq and Afghanistan commander is showing savviness on mounting a return to public life. He has chosen to work with a charity that helps American veterans reintegrate into daily life. All for charity: CIA director David Petraeus¿ new gig . The former four-star general and fitness freak is even offering a chance to get sweaty with him for the price of a sandwich. It’s all in the name of charity and for the price of a $10 raffle ticket.

After the run with Petraeus — around the National Mall in Washington, there’s a session of 'mental' exercises 'discussing military strategy over a well-deserved coffee.' No doubt, there will be plenty to talk about.","Six months since affair with biographer was revealed .

"Manchester United defender Paddy McNair says he could have no better education than training against Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao. The 19-year-old's ambition earlier this season was to establish himself in Warren Joyce's Under 21 side but United's injury crisis forced him to the fore.

But it's obviously really good for me. It's only going to make me a better defender to be playing against world-class strikers every day. 'I'm just looking forward to the season continuing and trying to get better each day. Their goalscoring records speak for themselves, so if I can stop them in training then I must be doing something right.' McNair doesn't just praise Messrs Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao though. The centre back says United's up-and-coming striker James Wilson is also continuing his rapid development. 'Oh, he's brilliant,' said McNair. 'I think he's got everything.

Miriam O'Reilly, pictured with her Jack Russell, Marcia, is poised to stand as the Labour Party's candidate at the Heywood and Middleton by-election on October 9 . The television presenter, who has close links to Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman, is on a list of potential candidates being quizzed by party officials in London before a final selection decision by local party members in the constituency tomorrow. Party insiders believe Ms O’Reilly is the candidate to see off Ukip in a bitter fight expected to be dominated by the Rochdale child abuse scandal and the failings of Rochdale Council to protect vulnerable children. But the move will provoke a bitter internal row amid claims that Labour national bosses are once again trying to ‘parachute in’ a candidate against the wishes of local party members. The Mail on Sunday has learnt highly regarded solicitor Richard Scorer, who represents some of the Rochdale abuse victims, has been kept off the final list in what will be seen as a bid to ease Ms O’Reilly’s selection. However, it is understood that a strong council leader candidate from Essex remains in the frame. Labour insiders believe the former Countryfile presenter is the party's best hope of beating Nigel Farage's Ukip . The October 9 by-election was caused by the sudden death last weekend of long-serving Labour MP Jim Dobbin, who at the 2010 Election had a majority of almost 6,000 over the Tories, with Ukip trailing in fifth. But the anti-Brussels party, which came within 24 votes of winning a local council seat last May, is now expected to make a serious challenge in the seat to prove it can win votes in Labour’s Northern heartland just as much as it can in the Tory shires. Ms O’Reilly, 57, who already serves on Harriet Harman’s commission investigating discrimination against older women, was not available for comment yesterday. But the Irish-born presenter made her leanings clear last year when she tried to become Labour candidate for Nuneaton. Last night, a well-placed party insider said: ‘The final choice will be up to local members in Heywood and Middleton. But there’s no doubt Miriam would be a great candidate. After all, she took on the BBC on age discrimination and won.’ Ms O’Reilly took the Corporation to an employment tribunal three years ago, after she was one of four female presenters in their 40s and 50s dropped from the popular rural affairs show. The tribunal found in her favour, ruling that she had been ‘dismissed almost entirely out of hand’ in a landmark judgment that caused the Corporation severe embarrassment. Ms O’Reilly later left the BBC. Last night, friends said that although she had no direct links to Heywood and Middleton, she had worked in Manchester as well as presented BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour when it dealt with child abuse stories. A spokeswoman for Ms Harman insisted she was not involved in the selection battle. But one Labour MP commented: ‘Here we go again – party bosses quietly trying to make sure their favoured candidates get through.’ The by-election was called following the sudden death of long-serving Labour MP Jim Dobbin .","Former TV presenter poised to stand in Heywood and Middleton by-election .

"Vincent Kompany is out of Manchester City’s clash with Sunderland on Wednesday night and now faces a race against time to be fit for next week’s Champions League decider against Roma. The news is a bitter blow for the Premier League champions with Yaya Toure already out of the trip to Italy and David Silva a major doubt. Kompany ended Sunday’s win over Southampton complaining of discomfort in his hamstring and City yesterday confirmed that their influential captain will miss tonight’s trip to the Stadium of Light and the home game against Everton on Saturday. Manchester City went down to nine men late on at Southampton after Vincent Kompany came off . City captain Kompany had only recently returned from an injury lay-off . The Belgium defender was sent for more scans yesterday to determine if he will have a chance of playing in the final Group E tie a week today. With Toure suspended after his red card against CSKA Moscow and Silva having missed the last six games with a knee injury, City could go into their biggest game of the season without three of their biggest stars. ‘Vincent Kompany is not able to play against Sunderland or Everton,’ said manager Manuel Pellegrini, who is still without Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov. ‘We’ll see if he makes it against Roma. That will depend on the opinion of the doctor. ‘It depends what degree of muscle injury he has. It’s very difficult to know in this moment if he can play against Roma. ‘David Silva is improving, We’ll see on Thursday if he can be in the squad list for Everton but I’m not sure. I think it’s difficult.’ With Eliaquim Mangala banned tonight following his sending-off at Southampton and Matija Nastasic still not match fit, Kompany’s absence also hands Pellegrini a problem for the game at Sunderland, where City have lost 1-0 on their last four visits. Dedryck Boyata, whose only two appearances this season have been in the Community Shield and Capital One Cup, or Bacary Sagna is set to partner Martin Demichelis in defence as City look to keep pace with Chelsea. ‘We have three options and we will see which two of them will play,’ said Pellegrini, who also insisted that the decision to keep Frank Lampard does not hinge on the outcome in Rome. Despite City’s poor record at the Stadium of Light, Samir Nasri is confident they can end the losing sequence there after three wins in a row in all competitions. Sunderland became the first team to shut Chelsea out on Saturday but Nasri is convinced that Sergio Aguero, the Premier League’s 12-goal top scorer, will find a way through. ‘In the past we have not had good experiences against Sunderland,’ said the Frenchman. ‘But up front we have someone who is flying and he can help us unlock any defence in the world. So we have to capitalise on that and hope he can make a difference. Centre back Eliaquim Mangala is suspended for Wednesday night's visit to Sunderland . Either Dedryck Boyata (left) or Bacary Sagna is likely to partner Martin Demichelis (second left) ‘We had a lack of confidence earlier in the season but everything is coming back.’ Meanwhile, Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole says City can expect the same treatment served to Chelsea when they bid to break down Sunderland. Midfielder Cattermole set the tone for the Black Cats’ resistance during Saturday’s stalemate and warns the champions that Gus Poyet will employ the same tactics this evening. ‘If we can go with the same game-plan and repeat the performance we put in on Saturday then I’m sure we’ll come away with something,’ he said. Poyet admits that he cannot explain Sunderland’s home hoodoo over City. ‘It is incredible,’ he said. ‘I don’t know how and I don’t know why. After what we did against Chelsea, we want to do something similar but with a goal. ‘We need to get a bit better and we will see what happens. I will take another 1-0. That would be perfect. City see an opportunity having closed the gap on Chelsea and they do not want to lose any more games. They will come here to win.’","Vincent Kompany hobbled off with hamstring injury against Southampton .

"A confidential call between the FBI and Scotland Yard was recorded by hacking group Anonymous - the very people they were trying to catch, it was revealed today. The group released a 15-minute tape of what appears to be a conference call last month about tracking and prosecuting the group’s members. The top-secret conversation begins with a bizarre exchange between the U.S. and British agents, where they talk about cheese and eating 'McDonald's at the Pentagon'. Scroll down for video . Trademark mask: Hacking group Anonymous is believed to have obtained the Stratfor emails for WikiLeaks . It is not known whether cheese and McDonald's are codenames or if the transcript simply reveals what is really at the top of the list of priorities of our law enforcement officers. There is also one point when 'Bruce', . the U.S. agent, says to the British agent 'Stuart': 'I'm not sure if . we're the only two on right now or not'. Anonymous also published a top secret . email apparently sent by an FBI agent, which gave details and a password . for accessing the call. The cyber raid is the most audacious and . sinister yet to be carried out by the shadowy hacking group and shows . how powerful Anonymous has become. And in a display of their growing reach, . Anonymous also claimed credit for hacking the websites of the police . forces in Boston, Massachusetts, and Salt Lake City, Utah. This came hours after they attacked the Greek Ministry . of Justice site. ‘The FBI might be curious how we're . able to continuously read their internal comms for some time now,’ the . group tweeted. Investigation: Those on the call talk about legal strategies in the . cases of Ryan Cleary, left, and Jake Davis, right - two British suspects . linked to Anonymous . The recording, which has since been . verified by the FBI, appears to have been edited to bleep out the names . of some suspects being discussed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation . said the information ‘was intended for law enforcement officers only and . was illegally obtained.’ 'A criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible' FBI spokesman . ‘A criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible,’ the law-enforcement bureau added. 'We are aware of the video, which . relates to an FBI conference call involving a PCeU (Police Central . e-crime Unit) representative,' London's Metropolitan Police said on . Friday. 'The matter is being investigated by . the FBI. At this stage no operational risks to the MPS have been . identified - however, we continue to carry out a full assessment.' Amid the material published by . Anonymous was a message purportedly sent by an FBI agent to . international law enforcement agencies. It invites his foreign counterparts to . join the call to ‘discuss the on-going investigations related to . Anonymous and other associated splinter groups’. Boast: The group gloated on Twitter as they released a recording of what appears to be a conference call last month about prosecuting their members . The email to officials in the UK, . Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and France had a phone number and . password for accessing the call. But only American and British . officials can be heard on the recording. Neither the FBI agent nor . others coded in on the call have commented. The conference call dial-in details were . reportedly sent in an email to officials and someone forwarded it to a . private, non-government email account which was compromised at some . point. 'If they haven't secured their email it could potentially prejudice the investigation' Karen Todner, lawyer for Ryan Cleary, linked with Anonymous . The email released by the hackers that appears to be the one the FBI sent out to organise the teleconference asked all participants to use a single code to gain entry to the call. The call would have been more secure if attendees had each been assigned unique access codes and been required to identify themselves by name upon dialling in, law enforcement sources said. If a hacker had dialled in with a unique access code and made it past initial screening, the organisers may have identified a breach when it became clear two parties were using the same dial-in. Those on the call talk about what . legal strategy to pursue in the cases of Ryan Cleary and Jake Davis - . two British suspects linked to Anonymous. They also discuss evidence against . other suspects. Karen Todner, a lawyer for Cleary, said the recording . could be ‘incredibly sensitive’. Embarrassment: The Federal Bureau of Investigation's headquarters are seen in Washington D.C. on Friday . She warned the breach could derail . police work. ‘If they haven't secured their email it could potentially . prejudice the investigation,’ she said. Anonymous is an amorphous collection . of online enthusiasts, pranksters and activists whose targets have . included the Church of Scientology. 'The FBI might be curious how we're able to continuously read their internal comms for some time now' Anonymous, on Twitter . They have also run attacks against the music industry, and financial companies such as Visa and MasterCard. Following a spate of arrests globally, . the group and its various offshoots have focused their attention on law . enforcement, especially the FBI. Data security expert Graham Cluley . said hackers were able to eavesdrop on the call because they had . compromised an investigator's emails. ‘The very people that (police) are . trying to apprehend, could have been tuning in to their internal . conversations,’ he wrote in a blog post. Intercepted call: A view of New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the London Metropolitan Police . Meanwhile, a message posted on the . Boston police website on Friday said: 'Anonymous hacks Boston Police . website in retaliation for police brutality at OWS (Occupy Wall . Street)'. Anonymous today launched a cyber-attack on the Greek Ministry of Justice website, and warned of plans to target a further 300 ministry and media sites. The hack was apparently a protest against the Greek government's signing of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which is designed to reduce internet piracy. The group has unleashed havoc on several European governments during the past month. Boston's Occupy movement set up camp in the city's financial district for two months last autumn, but police dismantled it in December, citing public health and safety concerns. The hackers in Utah gained access to sensitive . data, including citizen complaints about drug crimes, phone numbers, . addresses and other personal information, police said. ‘We're still knee deep in trying to get a feel for the . extent of the problem,’ Salt Lake City police Detective Dennis McGowan said on . Friday afternoon. 'A law enforcement agency using unencrypted, unsecure communications is a major fumble,' said Marcus Carey, who spent years securing communications for the U.S. National Security Agency. ‘What if this event was talking about some terrorist plot to blow up something and “they” were listening in? It could've been much worse if it was related to an Al Qaeda plot or something.’ A preliminary conversation is heard between British and U.S. law enforcement agencies before they discuss the operations against Anonymous: . 'Please enter your passcode followed by the # key or *0 to speak with an operator. Your passcode has been confirmed. Please wait while you are joined to the conference' 'Hello?''Hey Stuart? Hey, it's Bruce''Hello Bruce, how're you doing?''Alright.

I've told so many people. No-one believes me' Then the British law enforcement agent 'Stuart' speaks about their investigations: . See video here . Anonymous is a notorious group of hackers around the world who have no central authority. Masked: Anonymous has hit the headlines in the past for shutting down websites . The group was in the news last month for briefly shutting down the FBI and Justice Department websites in the U.S. after popular file-sharing website Megaupload was closed down. They work by agreeing on targets in internet chat rooms and then attacking at the same time. One of their most famous targets that generated much publicity was the Church of Scientology in 2008. Anonymous also attacked the Amazon, Visa, MasterCard and PayPal websites in 2010 after the companies decided to stop working with Julian Assange’s controversial website WikiLeaks. They have also attacked the websites of the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America for tightly controlling copyright, reported Agence France-Presse. Last autumn one hacker affiliated with Anonymous was arrested for allegedly targeting Sony's PlayStation Network, Qriocity music streaming and Sony Online Entertainment.","Hacking group made extraordinary recording of January conference call .

"He revealed in a recent interview that his relationship with Bo Bruce was a publicity stunt to earn her more votes on The Voice. But now a source close to the singer has hit back at The Script frontman Danny O'Donoghue, insisting Bo will 'never forgive him' for making their relationship seem less than it was. In the interview with Daily Mail reporter Spencer Bright last week, Danny had said: ‘I didn’t deny or confirm the . speculation. I found it funny. By not saying anything, it created its . own buzz. I thought I’d use it, and help Bo get publicity.' Anything but just publicity: Bo Bruce has been left devastated by Danny O'Donoghue's claims that their relationship was entirely for publicity . However, Bo has been left devastated and 'emotionally exhausted' by the interview, which she sees as further indication that Danny never really cared about her. The source exclusively told MailOnline: 'Bo and Danny's relationship was real and not a publicity stunt, despite Danny's claim that it was. 'Danny asked Bo to lie about it and never . admit it, but she was disgusted that he claimed it was just for . publicity. That was when they fell out for good... and she will never . forgive him for it.' 'Creating a buzz': Danny and Bo first sparked romance rumours on The Voice . Emotionally exhausted: The source also claims Danny wanted nothing to do with promotion of the single they wrote together, Alive . According to the source, Bo and Danny's relationship came to an end when he attempted to win back his ex Irma Mali - who banned him from having any more to do with Bo. The source added: 'They are no longer friends and he . abandoned Bo whilst trying to win back his ex, who made him promise not . to associate himself with Bo.' While Bo and Danny worked together on the single Alive, from Bo's album Before I Go To Sleep, the source claims that aside from writing the track together, Danny refused to have anything else to do with the song after the pair fell out following their split. Banned: Danny's ex Irma Mali is said to have told him not to see Bo anymore when he was trying to win her back . The source said: 'Apart from the co-write of Alive last . year and one tweet about her album that bandmate Glenn tweeted for him . earlier this year, Danny has refused to support Bo. 'He did not help Bo . promote the single Alive because they couldn't be seen together or . talk about their work together, which Bo feels totally jeopardised the . promo campaign for the single and possibly her career.'

"A man who threatened to slit his pregnant girlfriend’s throat with a Stanley knife unless she converted to Islam was spared jail today. Kuldeep Chail, 47, made the announcement about his girlfriend to a complete stranger he had approached at a bus stop, who was so disturbed by the threat he alerted the police. Chail told Mohammed Malik that he wanted his 'white Christian' partner to convert to Islam, but that she 'woudn't listen', before showing the alarmed bus passenger a Stanley knife and making cutting motions across his throat. Suspended sentence: Kuldeep Chail was accompanied by his girlfriend outside Snaresbrook Crown Court . Chail approached Mr Malik at a bus stop in Ilford, Essex, and told him his 'wife' had a baby 'in her belly' and that he was going to show her some videos about Islam. But when he appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court today it emerged that Chail is himself a Sikh, not a Muslim, and that he is not in fact married to his pregnant partner. The 47-year-old - who was accompanied by his pregnant girlfriend at the court - was given a suspended prison sentence of nine months. Chail's defence solicitor told the court he only made the comments because he was drunk. Prosecutor Patricia Deighan described Chail's comments to Mr Malik in the court saying: '...The defendant said: ""...My wife is a white. She has my baby. She is Christian, the baby is in her belly. '""I want her to convert to Islam but she won't listen. Today I am going to show her some videos about Islam.""' Ms Deighan added: 'The defendant then showed Mr Malik a silver and black Stanley knife. 'He then made a movement with his hand across his throat in a sort of cut-throat motion. 'He said: ""I don't know if I will kill her, sorry for wasting your time, my bus is here, I have got to go.""' 'Vile words': Kuldeep Chail (centre) was drunk when he made the threats about his girlfriend (right), his solicitor said . The court was told Mr Malik was so concerned he called police as soon as Chail boarded the bus on April 24 this year. He was apprehended soon after and later admitted to having an article with a blade or point. Chail's solicitor Kerry Moore said his client, who is from Ilford, had 'no intention to use the knife for a violent purpose at all.' He said the threat was made by an 'intoxicated man', insisted it had no substance, and claimed Chail's traumatic early life in Kashmir had driven him to drink. Recorder Karl King said Chail's 'vile words' had caused 'enormous concern and fear'. 'You used a personal problem emboldened by the alcohol to engage in conversation in which you made the most horrendous threats to your own partner,' he said. Chail was sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for two years, and also given an 18 month supervision order and ordered to attend an alcohol treatment programme.","Kuldeep Chail, 47, made the threats about his girlfriend to a complete stranger he approached at a bus stop .

"For decades they have fought to save lives, staying strong and determined in the face of terrible injuries. But last night, as the lights finally dimmed in the Accident and Emergency department of Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, it all proved too much for the loyal casualty nurses. Many of the men and women who had worked in the hospital - some for almost 40 years - wept as they bade farewell to the A&E department, which is relocating to a more modern building. Tears: Emotional nurses gathered in the ward after their final night shift on Monday .

Staff worked under cramped conditions with peeling paintwork and a walk across a car park to the x-ray machine. Matron Juliette Hughes, who had . worked at Frenchay for 26 years, said: 'Frenchay has been here such a . long time, people have such fond memories. I think the community really . feel it is their hospital. On the move: workers shift equipment out of the department, whose operations will be transferred to a new hospital . Fond farewell: Staff wrote messages on a hospital door recording their time in the department . Location: Frenchay is located on the outskirts of Bristol .

"This is the touching moment a NASCAR driver kissed his girlfriend who is battling Stage III ovarian cancer just seconds before competing in a race. Martin Truex Jr, 34, was captured embracing his long-time partner, Sherry Pollex, in glorious sunshine before the green flag dropped at Martinsville Speedway in Ridgeway, Virginia. It was just the third time Miss Pollex had been at a race track since she underwent life-saving surgery on August 15 following months of doctors visits with no answers. Donning a large hat to protect her head from the sun, the 35-year-old beamed as she greeted friends, some of whom she was seeing for the first time since her devastating diagnosis. Supporting each other: This is the touching moment NASCAR driver Martin Truex Jr kissed his long-time girlfriend, Sherry Pollex, who is battling Stage III ovarian cancer, just seconds before competing in a race . Before her boyfriend of eight years took to the track, she also joined him in singing along to the national anthem, and offered him a final word of support. Truex and his Furniture Row Racing Sprint Cup team placed 26th in the Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500 on Sunday, which was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr, his 23rd NASCAR Sprint Cup victory. Later in the day, Miss Pollex, who was wearing a blonde wig, tweeted about the day's events, saying: 'What a beautiful day for a race! I'm SO happy to be here in Martinsville!' Miss Pollex, from North Carolina, who runs the popular Mooresville boutique shop, Lavendar, and whose father, Greg, owned a NASCAR team from 1993 to 2006, started feeling ill in mid-summer. Couple:  Truex, 34, was captured embracing his long-time partner in glorious sunshine before the green flag dropped at Martinsville Speedway in Ridgeway, Virginia. Above, the couple are pictured at the track . In good spirits: Later in the day, Miss Pollex took to Twitter to express her delight at being able to witness the event, saying: 'What a beautiful day for a race! I'm SO happy to be here in Martinsville!' Thankful: A week earlier, while at Talladega Superspeedway, Miss Pollex tweeted: 'Feels SO good to be back at the track to see all my friends. God is good.' She is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment . She and Truex had just started thinking about having their first child, so she initially thought she might be pregnant. But after visiting a number of doctors, she still had no definitive answer. 'She had gone to three or four doctors, and they couldn't figure out what was going on,' Truex, a two-time Nationwide Series champion (in 2004 and 2005), told USA Today. ""This went on for a couple of months. Finally, we got her to a surgeon - a friend of a friend - in Lake Norman. He said right away, ""Let's do a CT scan"". Two hours after the scan in early August, the surgeon called the couple and asked them to come to his office. He then delivered the shocking blow - Miss Pollex had ovarian cancer. Race: Truex and his Furniture Row Racing Sprint Cup team placed 26th in the Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500 on Sunday, which was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr (pictured doing a victory lap following his win) Together: Miss Pollex is one of around 22,000 U.S. women to be struck down with ovarian cancer annually, according to the American Cancer Society. Above, the businesswoman and Truex are pictured in 2007 . Miss Pollex - one of around 22,000 U.S. women to be struck down with the disease annually, according to the American Cancer Society - immediately asked doctors if she could save her eggs. However, she was told she would die if her surgery was delayed . 'I don't know what hit me worse – the devastation that I couldn't carry my own child or the devastation that I had Stage III cancer. To hear all that in a matter of five minutes - it was so hard,' she said. Miss Pollex and Truex, who met around eight years ago, are pictured embracing in November 2007 . During the lengthy operation, Miss Pollex's appendix, spleen, ovaries, Fallopian tubes and parts of her stomach were removed. It was eight days before she was well enough to leave hospital. Four weeks later, she started weekly chemotherapy treatments, that will last until January. These involve receiving medicine through a port in her stomach. Miss Pollex, a native of Michigan, told the newspaper her reaction to the treatment has been relatively mild, but she has lost her hair, dropped in weight and tires easily. She said the slower lifestyle was a huge contrast from her previous way of living life 'in fourth gear', co-founding and running the Martin Truex Jr Foundation alongside her own business. Over the past seven years, the Foundation has assisted many children who have been affected by pediatric cancer, as well as their families. Miss Pollex is now working closely with the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance to promote awareness of the deadly disease, which is not often spoken about. 'I don't know if I'm going to be here in five years. I don't know if I'm going to be here in two years,' she said. 'All I can do right now is fight and try to help other women so they don't make the same mistake.' Symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, feeling full quickly, fatigue and the need to urinate urgently or more often.

"He was the hardman ruler of the Soviet Union's most loyal vassal state who faced off against Nato and commanded an army of a million men... but he couldn't stand to be around his wife. East German leader Erich Honecker was so fed up in his marriage with wife Margot that he even arranged for her to go on separate foreign trips when he was away so she wouldn't be able to travel with him. He referred to her behind her back with the name the streets gave to her, 'the purple dragon', from the sometimes bizarre shades of colouring she used on her hair. Public face: Erich Honecker and wife Margo, seen in their adopted home in Santiago, Chile, displayed an image of being happily married. But new files paint a very different picture . Intelligence reports collated by the BND spy service of West Germany have just been published and show that Honecker, who ruled the so-called German Democratic Republic for 28 years, had a 'difficult' marriage with his partner Margot that he eased by indulging in affairs. And so did she. While he and his politburo preached the benefits of marriage to building a 'strong socialist state', Honecker played away when he got the chance. Once when he was invited to Japan in 1981 he made sure his Communist brethren in then Yugoslavia invited her - she was the country's education minister - to Belgrade at the same time. Loveless: Files reveal Erich and Margot Honecker's marriage was only held together for party and state purposes . This time it wasn't to chase the ladies but so 'I can find some peace and quiet', a file quoted Honecker as saying. According to the files, the marriage to . Margot was apparently 'already over by this time in all but name and was . only being held together for party and state purposes.' While Erich was reportedly having an . affair with one of his co-workers, Margot was linked to one of the . country’s top economists Guenter Mittag, according to Spiegel magazine, . which accessed the BND files. East German guards look on as the Berlin Wall is destroyed in 1989 . BND snoops painted Honecker as something of a sexual predator who particularly liked younger females and observed that the the politburo 'pressured Erich into marrying Margot in 1953 so that his frequent affairs with young girls would have an end'. The couple only married after the birth of their daughter Sonja in 1952, which itself occurred during his first marriage to Edith Baumann. Honecker was also quoted as saying to an aide that his wife 'exasperated' him - and he wondered if 'western leaders have this problem?' BND transcripts also showed how he abused his position in other ways. In December 1981, as the Cold War still . dragged on, he took thousands of border guards and troops from front . line Iron Curtain duty to search for a suitable hunting dog across the . country. Secrets: Honecker, pictured taking a walk in his neighbourhood of La Reina in Santiago, in 1993, died of liver cancer long before details emerged . Addicted to hunting, Honecker felt he was let down when foreign dignitaries joined him on his killing expeditions in the woods around Berlin because he didn't have a 'suitable hound'. 'The whole republic is being scoured for a dog,' said a BND report. Finally a suitable pooch was found near the city of Magdeburg - 'three and-a-half years old, short haired and good tempered,' said the report. Despite the marital upsets of the Honeckers they fled to Chile together after East Germany imploded in 1989. Honecker would have faced trial if he stayed in a reunited Germany because of the shoot-to-kill orders he gave to the guards on the Berlin Wall. Honecker died of liver cancer in 1994 in Chile.

The unique 20,000 year old phenomenon was spotted following a major upgrade to the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Scroll down for video .

Florida Manatees are gentle giants . that average around 10 feet long, weigh over 1000 pounds, and spend up . to eight hours a day grazing on sea plants. They occupy the remainder of . their day resting, often on their backs with their flippers crossed . over their large bellies, in a pose closely resembling W50. Dangerous . encounters with boat propellers injure many of these curious . herbivores, giving them deep, curved scars similar in appearance to the . arcs made by the powerful jets on the large W50 remnant. 'Optically bright astronomical objects, . those visible to the eye and optical telescopes, often are nicknamed for . their earthly likenesses, such as the Whirlpool Galaxy and Owl Nebula,' said the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in a statement. When the VLA's giant W50 image reached . the NRAO Director's office, Heidi Winter, the Director's Executive . Assistant, saw the likeness to a manatee, the endangered marine mammals . known as 'sea cows' that congregate in warm waters in the southeastern . United States. The enormous W50 cloud formed when a giant star, 18,000 light years away in the constellation of Aquila, exploded as a supernova around twenty thousand years ago, sending its outer gases flying outward in an expanding bubble. The remaining, gravitationally-crushed relic of that giant star, usually a black hole, feeds on gas from a very close, companion star. The cannibalized gas collects in a disk around the black hole. The disk and black hole's network of powerful magnetic field lines acts like an enormous railroad system to snag charged particles out of the disk and channel them outward in powerful jets traveling at nearly the speed of light. The Manatee Nebula, W50, (green dot) is found 18,000 light years away in the direction of the constellation Aquila, the Eagle . This system of a black hole and its feeder star shines brightly in both radio waves and X-rays and is known collectively as the SS433 microquasar. Over time, the microquasar's jets have forced their way through the expanding gases of the W50 bubble, eventually punching bulges outward on either side. The jets also wobble, like an unstable spinning top, and blaze vivid corkscrew patterns across the inflating bulges. Until now, the nebula was known as W50, a less catchy name by being the 50th radio source listed in the Westerhout Catalog, assembled in 1958 by Dutch astronomer, Gart Westerhout.","W50 is one of the largest supernova remnants ever viewed .

"The surviving accused Boston Marathon bombing suspect wants a second lawyer added to his taxpayer-funded legal brain trust. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s current lawyer filed a motion Monday in court requesting Virginia attorney David Bruck, said to be a death penalty expert, be added to the alleged terrorist’s publicly subsidized defense team. Bruck was able to negotiate life sentences for several notable terrorists including one of the hijackers of Pan Am flight 82 in 1986 and one of the four men convicted for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, according to reports. Arraigned: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to over 30 charges stemming from the April 15 attack and subsequent escape attempt . This is the second request made by Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke to add Bruck, the first one was denied in April by a judge, according to New England Cable News. Tsarnaev, 19, pled not guilty last week to 30 federal charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, related to the bombs both he and brother Tamarlan Tsarnaev set off near the Boston marathon finish line April 15, killing three and wounding hundreds, according to WCVB. Tsarnaev also pled not guilty to charges from a carjacking and the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer during a next-day getaway attempt. Hospitalized since capture with severe wounds sustained during repeated exchanges of gunfire that terrorized local residents and forced police to close many roads and shut down mass transit, effectively paralyzing the region, Tsarnaev is looking to avoid being executed if found guilty of the 17 charges that carry the death penalty. In the filing, Clarke wrote ‘If this case did not present ‘exceptional circumstances’ justifying appointment of an additional lawyer learned in the law applicable to capital cases ... no case would,’ according to the Boston Herald. Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing . Somber: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev looking dejected in this sketch of his most recent court appearance last week . ‘Media reports have described the global scope of the investigation, involving hundreds of agents and witness interviews,’ Clark continued, according to the Herald, ‘counsel expect that the amount of discovery that this investigation will produce will be truly massive. Thus even were this not a potentially capital case, the magnitude of the task confronting Mr. Tsarnaev’s attorneys would be daunting.’ Clarke is also a death penalty expert, having negotiated life sentences for Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph, the Herald said. Prosecutors have not yet decided whether to pursue the death penalty, according to reports.","This is the second attempt to add death penalty expert David Bruck, a judge denied the first one .

"Alex Song retired from international duty this month but there was a Cameroonian feel to his choice of footwear, as he paid homage to cousin and former Cameroon star, Rigobert Song. Alex wore a pair of limited edition Puma King boots, one red and one yellow, just like Rigobert at the 1998 World Cup in France.

"This schoolboy has set his sights on a professional rugby career - despite being born with just one hand. Ben Seward was born with his right arm missing the wrist and hand but he hasn't let his disability hold him back and has been a keen rugby player since he was just seven-years-old. The 10-year-old, from Chorley, Lancashire, has a prosthetic hand but due to health and safety concerns he is not allowed to wear it on the pitch and copes with just one hand. Rugby-mad Ben Seward, centre, was born with only one hand, pictured with his parents David and Carol . Despite his disability, Ben, pictured,  does not allow it to stop him from playing the game he loves . His dream is that when he grows up he can play with his favourite team the Wigan Warriors, pictured . Ben plays winger and centre for Chorley Panthers under 11s and dreams of a career playing for his idols, the Wigan Warriors, when he is older. He said: 'I have been playing rugby for nearly four years now. I started playing rugby because it was a good way for me to keep fit and it is a team sport so everyone can get involved. 'The thing I love the most about it is that I have made so many new friends and get to meet lots of people. 'My favourite team are the Wigan Warriors and I go to watch all of their home games. I have met a lot of the players too and my favourite player Josh Charnley used to play for the same team as me. 'I go to training camps at Wigan every summer too and have even had the chance to play against some of my favourite players which is really exciting. 'Going to the camps and playing for Chorley Panthers helped me decide that I definitely want to play professionally. My coaches have been amazing and I have improved a lot over the past few years. 'I have two favourite positions, winger and centre. If I play centre then I get to tackle a lot more - sometimes it can be quite scary because there are some really tough players. 'I don't think having one hand holds me back from playing rugby at all, and when I start secondary school in September I am hoping to be able to play for them too one day.' And Ben isn't the only rugby fan in the family as dad David, 38, is the reason behind the schoolboy's obsession and Carol, David and daughter Kaitlyn, 12, are also season ticket holders. Mum Carol said that having one hand has never stopped Ben doing anything and that the brave schoolboy rarely wears his prosthetic hand except for 'cosmetic reasons'. Doctors believe that Ben punched through the lining of the womb causing fibres to wrap around his arm . Ben, pictured, has been playing for the Chorley Panthers under 11s, where his idol Josh Charnley started . The 39-year-old teaching assistant said: 'Ben is completely obsessed with rugby - it is his life. 'He isn't allowed to wear his prosthetic hand when he plays because of health and safety as it is quite hard and could harm another player on the pitch. 'But he wouldn't want to as sometimes it just gets in his way and he copes just fine with one hand. He gives it his all. 'He does very well with his rugby and is a very popular member of the team.. He is hoping to play for his high school as well when he starts in September. 'They make no exceptions for him and treat him just like every other child.' 'When he isn't playing it, he is watching it - no matter what team it is or if it is rugby league or rugby union. And he has a season ticket for the Wigan Warriors.' According to Mrs Seward, the only thing Ben cannot do like his friends  is tie his own shoelaces . The youngster's disability came as a huge shock to the family after what seemed to be a normal, healthy pregnancy - and his missing limb was only discovered after he was born. Doctors think it may be a result of Ben punching through the lining of the womb, in the early stages of pregnancy, causing fibres to become wrapped around his right arm. But the missing limb didn't delay his development and he was walking unaided at just 13-months-old and he has excelled in several sports such as football, rugby and javelin. Mrs Seward said: 'If there is something Ben can't do, he quickly works out his own way of doing it. He is amazing. 'He is just like any other child and he never uses his arm as an excuse. In fact the only thing Ben can't do is tie his own shoelaces. Everything else, he has a good go at. 'He has had a prosthetic arm since he was just seven-months-old but most of the time it is just a hindrance to him. 'He had a dress arm at first and then had months of training to use a mechanical arm but he doesn't wear a prosthetic often. 'He mainly wears it for cosmetic reasons rather than functional reasons - maybe if he was having a school photo taken or something like that.' Ben Seward, pictured, rarely wears a prosthetic arm, only using it on 'dress occasions' like a school photo .","Ben Seward, 10, from Chorley, Lancashire, was born with only one hand .

"Five people have been arrested after a Chinese student was found beaten to death in his apartment near University of Southern California. Xinran Ji, 24, an engineering student at USC, was attacked while walking near 29th Street and Orchard Avenue at 12.45pm in Los Angeles, California, last Thursday. Los Angeles Police said Ji was attacked with an 'unknown blunt object' but managed to stumble back to his apartment block where he was found dead later that morning. Scroll down for video . Todd Dickey (centre), senior vice president for administration at the University of Southern California speaks at a press conference earlier in the week yesterday following the death of student Xinran Ji . Officers discovered Ji’s body around . 7am on Thursday on the fourth floor of the City Park apartments in the . 1200 block of W. 30th Street at 7:11 a.m. located north of the campus. His family have been notified of his death. Speaking . at a press conference yesterday, police said the five people who had . been arrested included three juveniles and two adults. Four of those have been arrested on suspicion of homicide and the other on suspicion of robbery. Los Angeles Police Department Commander William 'Bill' Scott (left) and LAPD Public Information Officer Commander Andrew J. Smith (right) at the press conference earlier in the week . Speaking at a press conference . yesterday, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith 'detectives were 'pulling out all the . stops to get this thing wrapped up.' 'It's a very high priority for us to make sure that we take these guys into custody,' he added. Ji's murder has prompted fears over the safety of USC for international students in the area. In 2012, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, electrical engineering program students, were shot to death around 1am while sitting in a parked BMW a mile away from USC, just west of campus. University: A Chinese graduate student from the University of Southern California, pictured, was beaten to death near the campus . The parents of the two students later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the university, saying the school misled them when it claimed that it ranks 'among the safest in the nation.' In February 2014, Bryan Barnes, 21, pleaded guilty to the students murder and was immediately sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. The victim's distraught parents said their children's murders had caused 'endless pain.' XiYong, father of the murdered Ying Wu, . said her killing 'shattered the dream and hope of our entire family into . pieces and pushed us into the abyss of endless pain. ' Wanzhi Qu, father of Ming Qu, described his son as a straight-A student gifted in piano and vocal performances. But the school has claimed it is safe. In a letter posted on the school’s website, USC Senior Vice President Elizabeth Garrett insisted that Ji's murder ‘was an isolated incident and there is no apparent threat to the campus community.' Apartments: City Park Apartments on W. 30th Street and Vermont Avenue where Ji died . Pete Foster, an officer with the university’s Department of Public Safety, added that 'any area around USC is really safe.' USC has the largest number of international students among any college in the United States. Six months after the deaths of Wu and Qu a gunman opened fire in a crowd outside a Halloween party near the centre of the university. Four people were wounded and the campus was cordoned off. However, Los Angeles police and USC officials claimed that the shooting was due to an argument between two people who were not affiliated with university. Afterwards, multiple security measures were put in place to beef up security. A fence was put up along the school's perimeter, and security guards began checking identification cards after 9pm. Another measure included limited access for the public between 9pm and 6pm, when only staff members, students and registered guests were allowed to visit. Fingerprint scanners, security cameras and licence plate readers were also introduced which led to a fall in reported crimes in 2013. However, some students still feel unsafe. Joe Benson, a senior undergraduate student told The Los Angeles Times: 'It's shocking, but at the same time you're almost desensitized because you're like, 'Are you kidding me? It happened again? Blaming lapse security, he added: 'What they're doing now isn't working.' According to students, the victim’s apartment complex was popular among international students because it was considered to be safe. USC's Dean of the Viterbi School of . Engineering Yannis Yortsos said in a statement: 'This news hits me very . deeply. On behalf of the School, my heartfelt condolences go out to the . family and friends of the victim. Yortsos said university officials have spoken to Ji's family and had made arrangements for them to travel to Los Angeles.

Pochettino said: ‘Could Ade play against Burnley? Maybe yes, he is not injured. Maybe I will make changes. We need to analyse who played against Crystal Palace and then see who has a chance. Adebayor returned to Africa last month amid rumours he was the victim of witchcraft from his own mother . ‘We have played 34 games, more than anyone else. We need to manage our players.’ Burnley boss Sean Dyche has warned English football is in danger of ‘brainwashing’ itself into believing homegrown players are inferior to expensive foreign stars. Dyche was disappointed goals by Scott Arfield and Danny Ings against QPR were not appreciated more, with pundits focusing on poor defending instead. ‘It would be nice to promote the fact that two young British players — new to the Premier League — can score goals like that,’ said Dyche, who has fielded the same all-British line-up in the last seven Premier League games. Burnley manager Sean Dyche has called for more praise for the likes of Danny Ings (left) and Scott Arfield .","Emmanuel Adebayor has not featured for his club since November .

"Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo is likely to escape sanction from the Football Association after posting a photo of drug lord Pablo Escobar on his Instagram account. The FA have been clamping down on political or inappropriate messages posted on footballer’s social media accounts in recent times. Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has sparked fury with an Instagram post of drug lord Pablo Escobar . Rojo uploaded the picture of Escobar - who was linked to hundreds of police deaths in Colombia . Sportsmail understands that Rojo is not to set to be charged but he can expect to be warned and reminded of his responsibilities by the governing body. His post provoked a furious reaction by Instagram users with the photograph of the Colombian Escobar - known as the King of Cocaine - during the 1980s and ‘90s. One user on Instagram, ‘maikomolano.s’ replied: ‘How bad @Marcosrojo that you admire the words of somebody who did so much damage to our country.’ The 24-year-old Rojo has missed United's last six matches in all competitions due to a thigh injury . Rojo’s mishap follows Mario Balotelli’s suspension and fine for breaking the FA’s social media rules in December. The furore started when Balotelli reposted a picture of the video game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.’ Below the picture, it added: ‘Jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’ The FA may also punish Robert Huth for tweets that were deemed offensive by the transgender community last week.","Marcos Rojo sparked fury by posting picture of Pablo Escobar .

"Tennis legend Novak Djokovic has opened up about his past during a poignant on-camera journey which traces his remarkable journey from war-torn Serbia to world No.1. However, the Jacob's Creek documentary for the 'Made By' series has plenty of light moments thanks to Djokovic - otherwise known as 'The Joker's' trademark sense of humour . This is particularly true when the cheeky tennis player attempts to mimic a true blue Aussie accent, in preview footage exlusively obtained by Daily Mail Australia. 'G'day mate, how ya' goin'?' he says, semi-convincingly. 'Good on ya, fair dinkum, knackers!' he attempts, proceeding to screw his face up and burst out laughing. Scroll down for video . 'Fair dinkum, Knackers': Novak Djokovic erupts with laugher after trying to mimic an ocker Australian accent . Champion! The World No.1 returns to his childhood bedroom to prove just how far he's come from his humble beginnings in war torn Serbia . Djokovic admits making the nostalgic trip down memory lane for Australia's largest wine brand Jacob's Creek's was among the most emotional missions he'd ever embarked on. The seven-times grand slam champion and Australian Open favourite grew up in Belgrade at the height of the Balkan war in the 1990s and hopes the series shows anything is possible. 'There is something deeper in it, some inspiration that moves people who follow sports but also like to see where you come from, what's your background, who you've been shaped by,' he said. 'Most people see you for who you are right now but not many see the background of the story and the development and obviously my particular story there were a lot of things going on. 'It wasn't that ordinary, I would say, with wars and difficult times while growing up. The global premiere  was held in Melbourne Tuesday night so Australia was the first in the world to see the film series . The tennis champion is the favourite ahead of the Australian Open which commes on January 19 in Melbourne . Of his decision to take part in the series, Djokovic said: ‘I was inspired to partner with Jacob’s Creek. This is also an opportunity of having such a strong partner to represent my story and myself and who I am' ''This series shows all the circumstances, all the past obstacles that I've had to overcome in order to develop and become the world's best tennis player,' said the tennis champion . 'This series shows all the circumstances, all the past obstacles that I've had to overcome in order to develop and become the world's best tennis player. 'Obviously inspiring others who one day want to become professional tennis players or athletes, this is something that we will sincerely achieve with this Jacob's Creek series.' For a man who grew up in a war torn country and has since had to work so tirelessly to reach the top, it has never been easy. Yet evidently the 27-year-old has never lost his love of fun. He has a self-deprecating humour which makes watching his story so endearing. 'We're going to have a lot of bloopers!' he laughs to the camera, as he prepares to let people see a side of him he hasn't shared before. The film gives a sweet insight into his true nature, capturing him as he mucks around the film crew, does tricks with his racquet, sings care-freely and using his tennis racquet as a guitar. At first, Djokovic's attempt to mimic the Australian accent is semi-convincing, but it quickly goes south! The film gives a sweet insight into his true nature, capturing him as he mucks around the film crew, does tricks with his racquet, sings care-freely and using his tennis racquet as a guitar . Whilst filming at a Serbian tennis court from his childhood, Djokovic plays with a pup with childish abandon . However, there was a very serious and important reason that Djokovic decided to embark on the project with Jacob's Creek. He is hoping to inspire a whole new generation of tennis players by returning to his humble hometown and showing just how far he has come. It meant Djokovic had to face some tough memories and counts returning to the home of his first-ever coach, the late Jelena Gencic, who discovered Djokovic at age six, as a particularly moving experience. Djokovic credited the Gencic, who also coached Monica Seles and Goran Ivanisevic, for teaching him 'everything I know' after her passing during the 2013 French Open. 'Going back to Jelena's house, obviously where I spent a lot of time when I was younger, and not having her there as my host was not easy for me to experience. It felt a bit strange,' Djokovic said before the series release on Tuesday night. 'So making this film series was emotional and there were some tough moments, but generally it was a very positive experience,' said Djokovic of the Jacob's Creek series . 'But I retain the best memories that I could have and I always remember her with a smile and she was one of the most important people in my life. 'So making this film series was emotional and there were some tough moments, but generally it was a very positive experience.' Djokovic, 27, said it was an honour to be chosen for the series following the great success of a similar production featuring former world No.1 and four-time Australian Open champion Andre Agassi. The Serb has the chance to surpass Roger Federer's and Agassi's joint open-era record with a fifth crown at Melbourne Park. You can watch the films live on the Jacob's Creek 'Made By' website.

Former Manchester United and England star Phil Neville has failed to tackle a single piece of housework during his 15-year marriage, his wife has revealed. The football pundit, who has just made his first cup of coffee at the age of 37, has no idea where the ironing board is kept and would not know how to turn on an oven. 'All his talent is in his toes, that's for certain,' a remarkably sanguine Julie Neville said. Phil Neville, pictured during his playing days at Manchester United (left), poked fun at himself on Twitter . Neville's wife Julie also revealed that her husband has never used a mop, vacuum or dishwasher . With news of his relaxed attitude to housework floating around social media, Neville took the opportunity to poke fun at himself on Twitter. The former Everton utility man tweeted an image of himself with a vacuum cleaner, a mop and a variety of cleaning products, along with the caption: 'Time to get started......#nescafe'. Neville, who played 59 times for England and won six Premier League titles with United, first hinted at his lack of skill around the house on BBC Radio 5 at the weekend. He said he 'sprinted into the kitchen' and phoned his wife to ask 'how the hell do I make a cup of coffee' after the Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton asked for one during an interview at the couple's £3.6million Cheshire home. Ex-Everton midfielder Neville, pictured on Match of the Day, is now a pundit and commentator with the BBC . The Neville couple, pictured left in 2000 and right in 2003, have been together for 18 years . The father of two later told how he made it with a 'kettle… two little scoops of coffee', and laughed: 'I've lived in a bubble all my life.' His wife then revealed in a separate radio interview that he had never used a vacuum cleaner, mop, dishwasher or washing machine. And on Monday, when asked if he had any redeeming talents around the house such as putting the rubbish out or mowing the lawn, she said he did neither. She added: 'Ironing? Oh gosh no, he wouldn't even know where we keep the ironing board… He wouldn't know how to turn an oven on.

Phil is an amazing father and husband – just not domesticated in any way.' Speaking about her husband's first attempt to make a cup of coffee, the 39-year-old said: 'If you'd seen it you would not have thought it was classed as a coffee. I didn't taste it, but it didn't look good.' But Sportsmail's Lawton was more generous, saying: 'For a first go, it was very good.' As for Neville, he has insisted he would 'never drink the stuff' anyway but confirmed that he has made tea.","Phil Neville only made his first cup of instant coffee last month .
