"By . Glen Owen . BBC controller of English regions David Holdsworth, pictured, spent £11,050 wining and dining between 2010 and 2013 . The BBC has censored details of the licence- fee-funded ‘champagne  and seabass’ meals enjoyed by executives – because  it says the ‘dietary preferences’ of staff should be kept secret. The Corporation has imposed the ban in  response to The Mail on Sunday’s revelation that it had spent more than £30,000 of public money holding ‘editorial meetings’ at top London restaurants in the past year. Receipts published by  this newspaper showed  that the executives had enjoyed dishes of seabass and 31-day dry-aged fillet steaks, accompanied  by glasses of champagne  and chablis. Now the BBC has announced that it is refusing to release any more lunch or dinner bills on the grounds that members of staff had a right to enjoy ‘privacy’ over their menu choices. The ban came in response to a Freedom of Information request for further details of executive dining habits. The BBC said: ‘On a previous occasion that such information was released, a newspaper published an article which contained strong criticism of the individuals involved. Information relating to an individual’s dietary preferences will attract a strong general expectation of privacy as it is inherently personal to the data subject.’ Our article, published in December, revealed that David Holdsworth, the controller of English regions, spent £11,050 on wining and dining from 2010 to 2013. Tory MP Rob Wilson said it was 'astonishing' that the BBC refused to be held to account over their 'profligate spending' The second most lavish spender was Peter Johnston, the £152,000-a-year director of BBC Northern Ireland, who spent £5,185, while Roger Wright, the £227,000- a-year controller of Radio 3, spent £4,758. At the time the BBC said that it employed 20,000 people ‘and this expenditure, released under our disclosure rules, equates to £1.50 per person, per year’. Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It is astonishing that the Corporation refuses to be held to account for its continued profligate spending. It has a deep, ingrained disregard for  other people’s money.’","Corporation had previously spent £30,000 holding meetings at top London restuarants .

"By . Sophie Freeman . It was once assumed that a young couple would get married and start a family as soon as they could. Today they are more likely to live together to see if they’re truly compatible before they consider tying the knot. However, a social scientist is now saying that getting married earlier actually makes a stronger partnership. In his new book, The Curmudgeon's Guide To Getting Ahead, Charles Murray says those who get married in their twenties have a stronger partnership than those who marry later in life . Charles Murray believes young people should be more open to what he calls a ‘startup marriage’ in their 20s, rather than waiting for a ‘merger marriage’ in their 30s. In his new book, The Curmudgeon’s Guide To Getting Ahead, he describes startup marriages as those in which the couple generally meet at university, or at the start of their careers, when they have little money and personal success is not yet assured. He claims they can make you happier than today’s popular ‘mergers’, where the pair meet and settle down later, when they are already doing well in their jobs and have achieved some level of success on their own. Dr Murray claims startups are more likely to achieve a ‘certain kind of symbiosis, where two people become more than the sum of the individuals’. His advice on marrying young echoes that of author Susan Patton, whose latest book, Marry Smart, has provoked uproar by urging women to find a husband while at university. Dr Murray, an American whose 1994 bestseller, The Bell Curve, sparked controversy for its analysis of IQ and class, compares the benefits of a start-up marriage with the early days of computer giant Microsoft. ‘For one thing, you will both have memories of your life together when it was still up in the air,’ he said. Charles Murray believes young people should be more open to what he calls a 'startup marriage' in their 20s, rather than waiting for a 'merger marriage' in their 30s . ‘I’m willing to bet that Bill Gates’s fondest memories are of the years when Microsoft went from being a couple of college dropouts in makeshift offices to a player in the new world of information technology, not of the year in which he became the richest man in the world. ‘The same applies to startup marriages. You’ll have fun remembering the years when you went from being scared newcomers to the point at which you realised you were going to make it. ‘Even more important, you and your spouse will have made your way together. Whatever happens, you will have shared the experience.’ Merger marriages do have their advantages, said Dr Murray, including fewer financial pressures and a lesser likelihood of spouses outgrowing each other as identities are ‘well formed’ by the time they meet. But startups can be special because ‘you will each know that you wouldn’t have become the person you are without each other’. Dr Murray said that people who marry later can still acquire the benefits of a startup marriage by making a major change to their lives, such as changing jobs. He said: ‘I was 40 when my wife and I married, but in practice we had a startup marriage. I had quit my secure job working at a social science research organisation and struck out into the unknown a year before we married. That was in 1983. ‘Everything that has happened in my career since then – including all my major books – has happened together.’ He believes there can be good reasons for delaying marriage, but that some of the reasons are part of the ‘Peter Pan syndrome’. ‘Not wanting to acknowledge that one is now a grown-up and it’s time to leave childish things behind. This is especially true of guys. 'You’ll have fun remembering the years when you went from being scared newcomers to the point at which you realised you were going to make it' ‘Historically, a significant reason men married was to get regular sexual access to a woman. Now, they say to themselves, why bother? Until they get old enough to realise that they’re missing out on something, which often takes a long time.’ However, his advice is the opposite to what most modern couples do. According to the latest numbers from the Office for National Statistics, there were 247,890 marriages in England and Wales in 2011, with the average ages of a first-time bride and groom being 30.2 and 32.2. The figures contrast sharply with those of 1981, when there were 351,973 and the average ages of a bride and groom were 23.1 and 25.4.","Charles Murray believes young people should be open to 'startup marriage'

"By . Simon Walters . Ed Miliband was left red-faced last night after voters rejected his boast that he is ‘more intelligent’ than David Cameron. According to a Mail on Sunday poll, the Prime Minister is seen as more than twice as intelligent as the Labour leader, who is lagging behind UKIP’s Nigel Farage in the brainbox ratings. Even more embarrassing, Miliband is regarded as ‘thicker, wetter and more sexless’ than Cameron, the Lib Dems’ Nick Clegg and Farage. David Cameron was described in the poll as cruel, bullying and phoney . The ‘political insults poll’ was . commissioned by this newspaper after a week in which Miliband launched a . provocative twin assault on the Conservatives. He argued he is ‘more . intellectually self confident’ than Cameron and followed it up with a . Labour TV broadcast that portrayed the PM as rich, uncaring and out of . touch, and Clegg as his feeble puppet. However, the Survation poll suggests Miliband may have been better advised to heed the adage about people in glass houses and stones. Asked to judge the four main leaders on ten less than flattering character traits, Miliband comes top in three – ‘thick’, ‘wet’ and ‘sexless’. Cameron hardly has anything to shout about, with first place in the five categories of ‘cruel’, ‘remote’, ‘phoney’, ‘sanctimonious’ and  ‘bully’. Deputy Prime Minister Clegg is seen as more ‘naïve’ than the others, while Farage is the most ‘cocky’. Asked who is the most ‘intellectually self confident’, Cameron wins by a country mile on 33 per cent, with Farage on 16, Miliband 14 and Clegg a meagre six. A total of 31 per cent of those polled didn’t know. Labour leader Ed Miliband was described as wet, sexless and thick . A total of 17 per cent said Miliband is ‘thick’ with Cameron seen as ‘least thick’ of the four on nine per cent. Asked which leader is most ‘wet’, Miliband comes top again, on 27 per cent, with Clegg on 25, Cameron 13 and Farage seven. A total of 19 per cent say the Labour leader is ‘sexless’ with Farage on 12, Cameron 11 and Clegg nine, making the Lib Dem leader the sexiest of the four. Cameron’s ‘cruel’ image will do little to help him shed the ‘Nasty Party’ tag that has dogged the Tories. And the perception of him as a ‘remote bully’ has echoes of his membership of Oxford’s notorious Bullingdon Club in his student days. However, Tory MP friends of the Prime Minister said he could draw some comfort from the findings. One said: ‘Given the choice of being seen as a hard b****** or a wet rag, most leaders would choose the former. Margaret Thatcher may not have been loved by millions, but millions voted for her because they respected her.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was described by those who completed the questionnaire as naive . If the key to winning the next Election is to convince the electorate you are a ‘nice guy’, Miliband may have the last laugh. A tiny five per cent regard him as a ‘bully’ and six per cent as ‘cruel’, compared to 25 and 18 for Cameron respectively. The two highest individual scores in the survey go to Clegg and Farage. One in three say the UKIP leader is ‘cocky’, with 28 per cent stating Clegg is ‘naïve’. But Cameron’s big lead in brainpower has failed to overhaul Labour, which remains at the top of the poll to win the next Election on 33 per cent, with the Tories five points behind on 28, UKIP on 20 and the Lib Dems 10. lSurvation interviewed 1,005 people online on Friday and Saturday. Potential voters described the UKIP leader Nigel Farage as 'cocky' Ed Miliband opened up an aggressive new front in his class war against the Government last week, using a controversial party political broadcast to portray the Prime Minister and his Cabinet as privileged, out-of-touch toffs. Miliband, who is considered to be a member of Labour aristocracy as the son of celebrated Marxist academic Ralph, lives in a £2.4 million North London home and has an estimated joint annual income of £350,000 with his barrister wife Justine. And what about the rest of his team? Here we profile some of Labour’s top figures to reveal their wealth, private school backgrounds and family connections to rival anyone in the Conservative Party.","David Cameron is described as 'cruel, bullying, sanctimonious and phoney'

"By . Candace Sutton . Seven hours after a fire truck fell into a sinkhole on Sydney's northern beaches, a crane has removed it from from the collapsed road. However, emergency services officers are still concerned about the safety of the 'unstable' roadway and up to 50 homes in the area are without water. The fire truck was called out to attend a burst water main when at around 4.45am, it rounded a corner of The Serpentine at Bilgola Beach and section of the road imploded beneath it. Three families were evacuated, five houses severely damaged and dozens of homes are now without water after the mains were turned off to prevent further flooding.

"By . Hugo Gye . A mother is furious after she was ordered to leave a cinema showing a 15-rated film because she had her baby daughter with her. Sam Ross was told she was 'breaking the law' by taking her baby to raunchy comedy Bad Neighbours - even though the 11-week-old girl is too young to understand any film. The cinema now says that she should never have been sold a ticket, as age limits are strictly enforced even for infants. Anger: Sam Ross was thrown out of the Vue cinema in Cambridge along with her 11-week-old daughter . The 30-year-old mother of two had gone to the Vue cinema in Cambridge with a friend, and both had bought tickets but were asked to leave before the film started. 'It was totally humiliating, we were escorted out,' Ms Ross said. 'I was really looking forward to watching the movie and catching up with a friend. 'As a new parent I don't get out that often and it can be difficult to find things you can do with friends. 'We were told we were breaking the law and that it was a criminal offence. It felt like we were being discriminated against. It's never been a problem before.' The pair were eventually given a refund for their tickets, but only after a 'long, infuriating' conversation with the cinema's manager. Raunchy: Bad Neighbours, starring Zac Efron, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, is a 15-rated comedy . Bad Neighbours is a 15-rated film about young parents, played by Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, who are trapped in a feud with Zac Efron, playing the leader of a fraternity which has moved in next door to them. The film features repeated swear words, sexual innuendo and violent slapstick humour. However, Ms Ross insisted that there was no reason why she should not have taken her infant daughter to the screening. 'At just 11 weeks old my daughter is totally oblivious to what's going on, she would have just gone off to sleep,' she said. 'It was a comedy not a violent film. 'If she was screaming and interrupting everyone I would totally understand and would never stay in the cinema, but she was completely fine. There were only six other people in the whole room.' A spokesman for Vue cinemas said that small children were only allowed in to U, PG and 12A-rated films, in accordance with official guidelines. 'On this particular occasion the customer should have been advised that babies are not permitted into 15 certificate films and declined the sale,' he said. 'Vue Entertainment apologises for any inconvenience caused and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn't happen again in future.' An editor at parenting website Mumsnet said that it was normal for mothers to take small children to films which they cannot understand. 'The cinema can be a great place for a new mum and a small baby as most tiny babies are unaffected by the noise and sleep throughout the film,' Emilie Carrington said. 'It can feel great to get out of the house and do something ""grown up"". However, many Mumsnetters recommend going to screenings designated for mums with babies.'","Sam Ross, 30, took her baby daughter to a screening of Bad Neighbours .

"By . Candace Sutton . A convicted criminal who says accused murderer Robert Xie made a jail cell confession to killing five members of his family was a prison heavy who gave police evidence 'they wanted' , a lawyer has told a murder trial. Graham Turnbull SC has told the jury on the third day of the NSW Supreme Court murder trial of Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie that the Crown case against the accused case was driven in large part by a 'ruthless criminal' who 'filled in the gaps' for police. Mr Xie, 50, is on trial for the murder of five members of the Lin family, who were bludgeoned to death with a hammer in 2009. The 50-year-old is the uncle and brother-in-law of the victims Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, and Mrs Lin's 39-year-old sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin. Prison cell confession: Testimony against Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, pictured outside court where is is standing trial in Sydney, says he confessed his guilt in killing five family members to a jail cellmate. His lawyer has told the murder trial  the cellmate was a prison heavy who knew he could exploit the accused . Bludgeoned to death with a hammer: Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, were killed in their Epping home. Death house: the Lin family home in the Sydney suburb of North Epping where Robert Xie allegedly beat five of his relatives to death . All five were beaten and asphyxiated in the bedrooms of the Lin's family home in the Sydney suburb of North Epping. Today in the conclusion of his opening address, Mr Turnbull SC described a convicted criminal known as 'Witness A' who has given a written testimony against Mr Xie as a 'practised informer'. He described the inmate, who became one of Mr Xie's cellmates after the accused was remanded in custody, as a 'physically intimidating man' who became aware that Xie was 'available for ruthless exploitation.' Mr Turnbull said the prisoner 'obtained evidence which bolstered the police case, what they needed, what they wanted'. In his opening case, Crown Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC had told the court Mr Xie had planned to have a dead man's DNA stolen from a funeral home and planted on the murder weapon in what he referred to as his 'Plan B'.He said Mr Xie had various conversations with Witness A about the killings and allegedly revealed he had bought the hammer used in the attack from a 'two-dollar shop' because he knew the store's security cameras were fake.The Crown told the court that Witness A had spoken of the plot, saying Xie had hoped to use a corrupt police officer - a friend of Witness A - to carry out the plan, but who was actually an undercover detective.This afternoon a woman who lived near the house where the murders took place has taken the stand. Janelle Ferguson said she lived next door to the Lin family in North Epping when the alleged murders occurred.She said on the night the the Lin family members died, her family went out to buy a pizza but came home around 8pm. Ms Ferguson said she was a light sleeper but no sound from the Lin house woke her during the night. The court has heard that the victims were killed as the murderer moved through the four bedrooms of their home over several hours in the middle of the night. The prosecution case is that Mr Xie was motivated by a bitterness towards the adults in his family.","The Lin family murder trial has opened for its third day at the Supreme Court in Sydney .

"By . Glen Owen And Brendan Carlin . Ed Miliband was facing turmoil last night after one of his own  MPs condemned his strategy as ‘suicidal’ and a Labour parliamentary candidate was secretly recorded describing his leadership as ‘dodgy’ and ‘incoherent’. The outbreak of open dissent – just days before crunch elections – followed a week of mounting panic in the party after the Conservatives recorded a lead in the polls for the first time in more than two years. Labour MPs have been privately briefing this weekend that if Mr Miliband does not ‘show progress’ in Thursday’s local and European election results, they would collectively break ranks to call for ‘a mass shake-up’ of strategy and personnel. Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, introduced his new American advisor David Axelrod, right, to his shadow cabinet earlier this week . The scale of the nervousness is revealed in a public broadside today from Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who urges Mr Miliband to abandon his strategy of ‘relying on the Government’s unpopularity’ to win next year’s General Election. ‘Sooner or later the Tories were always going to get their act together.... Now we need to up our game,’ Mr Danczuk says in an article, right, for today’s Mail on Sunday. The MP writes that ‘continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer’, and warns that the party will not win by relying on a ‘core vote  and a few disgruntled Liberals’ – which he describes devastatingly as ‘a suicidal strategy’. His remarks are a thinly veiled attack on the plan advocated by elections supremo Douglas Alexander to aim for a modest 35 per cent share of the vote at next year’s poll – and hope that the in-built advantage the party receives from the electoral system delivers a Commons majority. Mr Danczuk concludes: ‘Time is running out and if we don’t have a strong European and local elections next week then things need to change... more of the same won’t cut it.’ Labour candidate Tristan Osborne criticised Ed Miliband at a £100-a-head party fundraising dinner . Mr Danczuk’s fears were echoed by Tristan Osborne, a Labour parliamentary candidate in Chatham and Aylesford – one of the party’s key target seats – who was recorded making  critical remarks about Mr Miliband’s election strategy. ‘The machine is not functioning in any capacity,’ Mr Osborne was taped saying at a £100-a-ticket Labour fundraising event held on Tuesday. ‘We need to be appealing to the aspirational Southern voter. The current strategy doesn’t... indicate that we are winning over that type of support.’ Mr Osborne – highlighting a party election poster which falsely and embarrassingly suggested the Tories had put VAT on food, which is exempt – revealed the dismay felt by Labour candidates who see their chance of entering the Commons at the next Election fading. ‘I’m fearful,’ he said, citing a ‘dodgy campaign’ and ‘no coherent messaging’, before adding: ‘The economy is picking up. That reinforces the narrative that they (the Conservatives) are doing well, and there’s absolutely sod all anyone can do about that.’ The party’s meltdown started after two polls at the start of the week gave the Tories a rare lead over Labour, causing pundits to slash the chances of Labour securing a majority (see below). It coincided with the arrival in the UK of David Axelrod, the former Barack Obama election guru, who has been hired by Mr Miliband on a reported £250,000 contract to turn his fortunes around.The strategist – known as ‘The Axe’ – gave a short speech to the Shadow Cabinet, held meetings with key frontbenchers including Harriet Harman and addressed party staff about campaigning techniques. But sources say Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was the only senior Labour frontbencher not to ask a question when Mr Axelrod was introduced  to the Shadow Cabinet. Mr Balls  has been engaged in a thinly veiled turf war with Mr Alexander, who is credited with persuading the US elections guru to work for Labour. One source said: ‘Everybody asked Axelrod a question – everybody, that is, except Ed Balls. It wasn’t hard to read between the lines.’ But The Mail on Sunday also understands there was irritation that Mr Axelrod – who is not expected to spend much time in the UK – was only able to take questions for just over half an hour. One source said: ‘In the middle  of a vital election campaign, the Shadow Cabinet were all ordered  to be in London to meet this great figure. And yet when Ed introduced him, he said, “David can only be here for about 40 minutes.” That did not go down well.’ Witnesses said the quietly spoken Mr Axelrod – ‘more James Stewart than John Wayne’ – then spoke for under five minutes. ‘He said there were differences between the US  and British politics but one thing  was common – a sense of alienation among voters from the political process. It was all very nice but I’m not sure what it added to the sum of human knowledge,’ said the source. One senior Labour MP warned: ‘We are staying quiet until Thursday’s results, which have to show progress. If we lose seats then we are not on course to win the Election, and we will need to speak out. Miliband and Balls are becoming as dysfunctional as Blair and Brown, and Balls and Alexander loathe each other. We need a mass shake up’. Last night, Tory Cabinet Minister Eric Pickles came to the Labour leader’s support, saying he was genuinely an ‘Ed Miliband fan’ and insisting Labour had picked the right man. Communities Secretary Mr Pickles also warned his party not to underestimate Mr Miliband. ‘He is the authentic voice of Labour and we have made a series of mistakes collectively because we have always underestimated him,’ he said. Tristan Osborne refused to  comment last night.","Miliband blasted for relying on the Government's 'unpopularity' to win election .

"By . Richard Spillett . A man flew into a rage and stabbed his wife in the back after he woke up with cold feet because she hogged the bedsheets, a court has heard. Retired engineer Derek Miller, 76, is accused of plunging a 10-inch kitchen knife into Galina Miller's shoulder before telling her: 'You will die now.' Court hears that after his wife fled their home, sailing enthusiast Miller phoned the police and told them: 'I have just attempted to kill my wife. She's run away - I have failed.' The attack happened at the couple's seafront home in Broad Street, Old Portsmouth, which Mrs Miller fled in her dressing gown after being stabbed in the back, the city's Crown Court has heard . Portsmouth Crown Court heard Miller was 'resentful' that his wife was gaining independence and was out of the house more often. Mrs Miller, 57, had found a job teaching English to foreign students in Liphook, Hampshire after discovering once-wealthy Miller was £70,000 in debt, jurors heard. The couple's relationship had been 'on the rocks' before the attack, but they had tried to patch things up the previous night. Miller had bought his Russian-born wife chocolates, the 'biggest bunch of flowers he could find', and agreed to cook her dinner. But he is alleged to have become angry the next day when he woke up with cold feet and no covers on them. Prosecutor Rob Welling told the jury: 'That instantly made him angry and aggressive towards Galina.' Mr Miller told Portsmouth Crown Court that Mrs Miller 'goaded him' and he was 'getting rid of frustration' Mr Welling added: 'All the good work that had been done the night before collapsed around them and there was more arguing. 'There was more discussion about the divorce and the defendant said: ""So, is this the end now?""' Miller, from Portsmouth, Hants, is then said to have attacked his wife as she collected bin liners from the kitchen. Mr Welling added: 'She became aware of something odd about her shoulder. She turned round and found the defendant there in the kitchen, holding a huge kitchen knife. 'She very quickly learned and became aware that she was bleeding from her shoulder and that she had already been stabbed in the back.' Mr Welling said the knife was 'the biggest in the house' and Mrs Miller had not heard her husband enter the kitchen. He added: 'When she saw the knife he said ""you will die now"".' Miller, a father of three, told the jury: 'She turned her back and I picked up the knife. I was in a completely different world. I don't know why I did it. 'I did not intend to do it. I did not even know the knife was there. It just happened to be on the bench by the sink... I was in the land of the fairies. It was just getting rid of frustration.' Divorced Mr Miller met his second wife online and one of their first meetings was in Moscow's Red Square . Mrs Miller, still wearing her dressing gown, pushed her husband of 11 years to the floor and escaped after the attack on November 26 last year. Miller, who has no previous convictions, was the first person to dial 999. His emergency call was played to the court. He later told police: 'I'm sorry, it had to be done. She has goaded me for years.' The couple met online in 2002 and later met in Moscow's Red Square. They tied the knot later that year in what was Miller's second marriage. He had been a professional footballer in his youth before training in aeronautical engineering and later becoming an IT salesman. He became wealthy and was able to retire at the age of 50 before moving to Portsmouth in 1999 and joining Portsmouth Sailing Club. The pair travelled extensively before Mrs Miller gained a post-graduate degree at the University of Portsmouth. But Miller complained her work as a teacher left little time for him. The court heard Mrs Miller believed her husband had been looking on the internet for call girls and perhaps going with prostitutes before the attack. He told the court she was also convinced he was having a relationship with a shopworker at Lidl. He said: 'She just did not let it rest. She said: ""You are going down to the shop to see your girlfriend again.""' Miller denies attempted murder, and the trial continues.

"By . Stephen Wright . Chris Denning, 73, is to be prosecuted over 41 offences including indecent assault and another serious sexual offence between 1967 and 1985 . A disc jockey who was part of the original Radio 1 line-up was yesterday charged with a string of sex attacks on 22 boys aged between nine and 16. Chris Denning, 73, is to be prosecuted over 41 offences including indecent assault and another serious sexual offence between 1967 and 1985. Although not a household name, Denning posed for a picture with a host of famous BBC DJs for the launch of Radio 1 and Radio 2 in 1967. Among those alongside him were Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart, Pete Drummond and John Peel. Denning was arrested last June as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation into child sexual abuse allegations, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. He is the fifth person to be prosecuted as part of the operation. Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for London, said: ‘We have carefully considered the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in relation to Christopher Denning. ‘Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Denning to be charged with 41 offences, including 34 counts of indecent assault. These date from between 1967 and 1985, and relate to 22 male complainants aged between nine and 16 at the time of the alleged offending. ‘The decision to prosecute has been taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors and Crown Prosecution Service legal guidance on rape and child sexual abuse.’ Denning will appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court in Central London today. The prosecutor added: ‘We have also decided that no further action should be taken in relation to three further allegations against Mr Denning, made by three further complainants, as we determined that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.’ She did not reveal details of where the alleged attacks happened and the circumstances in which Denning allegedly met his accusers.

The two most recent allegations relate to two offences of indecent assault on a boy aged 16 between 1984 and 1985. Denning was the first announcer heard on BBC2 when the TV channel took to the air in 1964. He worked for Radio Luxembourg and Radio London before presenting Where It’s At with Kenny Everett on the BBC’s Light Programme. He then became one of the original DJs on BBC Radio 1, where he continued presenting Where It’s At, had his own weekly show and deputised for Tony Blackburn when he was absent from his breakfast show. Denning left Radio 1 in 1969 and worked for the record label Decca for two years. He is said to have worked as a music producer for The Beatles and to have helped launch the Bay City Rollers and Gary Glitter. He also ran his own music and video production business, and later moved overseas. When arrested last year, the former DJ was staying at a hostel for the homeless in East London.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . The longtime Connecticut home of one of Hollywood's most celebrated actresses could be yours - assuming you have about $15 million. The beachfront home of Katharine Hepburn - that in the latter part of her life she often referred to as 'paradise' - is on the market in the Fenwick borough of Old Saybrook in Connecticut's posh Middlesex County, and its current owners are asking a bargain $14.8 million for the 8,300-square-foot home. The newly renovated property had been in Hepburn's family for decades, and was the famed actress' home until her death in 2003. For sale: Hollywood legend Katharine Hepburn's beachfront, Connecticut home is currently for sale by its current owner . Hollywood: The Hollywood legend owned the Fenwick home for decades until her death in 2003 . Estate: The home is one of three lots on Hepburn's former property that the new owner, Frank Sciame, plans to sell separately . Private: The estate comes complete with its own private beach and mooring for boats . The home is on a 1.5-acre lot right on the Long Island Sound, where the home's new owners will be able to soak in a view of the sound from the property's private beach. In addition to the beach, the home comes complete with a private dock, a boat mooring and a pond, the listing agent, Colette Harron of William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty, tells the Wall Street Journal. Hepburn's former home is complete with 7 1/2 bathrooms and six bedrooms, and is part of a larger, three-lot property purchased by Frank Sciame, founder of Manhattan-based Sciame Construction, from Hepburn's estate in 2004 for $6 million. 'Paradise': The Hollywood star would often use the property as an escape from New York or L.A. for her and her family . Spacious: The 8,300-square-foot home sits on a 1 1/2-acre lot on the Long Island Sound . Renovations: The home's current owner, Frank Sciame, has completely renovated the six-bedroom home . Scenic: In addition to the view of Long Island Sound, the home also has a pond on the property . Sciame completely renovated the home after he purchased it, and initially put it on the market in 2011 - as well as the other two lots, which makes the total acreage for the property about 3 1/2 acres - for $28 million. In 2012, Sciame upped the price to $30 million after he gained approval to build an additional 3,000-square-foot home on one of the lots. Last year, the entire property was taken off the market, only to be put back on about a year later - however, the only lot currently for sale is the one with Hepburn's former home on it. Sciame says he's changed strategies in regard to how he plans to sell the properties, explaining to the Journal, 'the best return on investment is to sell the properties separately.' 'Paradise': In her 1996 memoir, Hepburn described her home in Fenwick as 'paradise' Compound: The property is part of a collection of properties that owner Frank Sciame plans to sell separately . Tub time: The home is equipped with seven recently renovated bathrooms in addition to the six bedrooms . Millions: Sciame bought the property from Hepburn's estate in 2004 for $6 million. He's now carving it up and selling the properties separately . He says he now plans to potentially keep the lot with the newly built 3,000-square-foot home for his family and sell the other lots - including the one with Hepburn's former home - separately, noting that he is in the process of getting approval to build a house on the third lot. Before Sciame's plans to carve up the property, it served as a retreat for Hepburn and her family. In her 1996 memoir, Me, Hepburn referred to her Fenwick estate as 'paradise,' likely do to its scenic views and access to golf, swimming and tennis, three things the film icon loved.","The estate belonged to Hepburn's family for decades until her death in 2003 .

"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . Controversy: Alastair Campbell admits flying to Egypt for talks with 'officials and politicians' Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell faced fresh controversy last night over this week’s expected landslide victory in Egypt’s election by the army hardman who led the country’s military coup. Campbell, Blair’s former spin doctor who was forced to quit No 10 in disgrace in 2003 after the Iraq War 'dodgy intelligence dossier' scandal, confirmed last night he has been to Egypt for talks with 'officials and politicians'. Asked to respond to reports from high-level sources that he has been advising the regime of Egypt’s ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, criticised for the deaths of more than 1,000 dissidents and the arrests of thousands of others, Campbell said: ‘I was in Cairo for a short visit a few weeks ago but not to work on the Sisi campaign.’ Pressed to say if he was advising Sisi’s regime in other ways he said: ‘I was in Egypt a few weeks ago to discuss, with officials and politicians, perceptions in the international media about Egypt in respect of concerns that are obvious.’ He refused to respond to further questions from this newspaper. Campbell’s mission to Egypt came weeks after Blair gave Sisi staunch backing during a visit to Cairo, when he praised the then-army leader for deposing the Muslim Brotherhood from power last year. Blair – visiting the country in his capacity as Middle East peace envoy – said that the Brotherhood, led by Mohammed Morsi, had ‘tried to take the country away from its basic values of hope and progress’. Blair and Campbell have retained close links since their days in Downing Street. Last October The Mail on Sunday revealed how Campbell had joined Blair in advising the government of Kazakhstan, run by hardline President Nazarbayev – a dictator whose regime has been criticised for serious human rights abuses. Wealthy oil-producing Gulf states have showered billions of pounds in cash and petroleum products on Egypt to support Sisi since he ousted Morsi. In February, Campbell gave a speech to the International Government Communication Forum in the UAE, which was bankrolled by the host regime. Campbell refused to speak directly to this newspaper yesterday about the nature of his visit to Egypt, responding instead by texts. Backing: Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (left) expects a landslide victory this week, and has received Tony Blair's backing. Sisi has been criticised for the deaths of more than 1,000 dissidents and the arrests of thousands more . He repeatedly said he had not worked on the Sisi campaign. After the MoS pointed out that we had not asked him whether he was working on Sisi’s ‘campaign’ – but whether he had advised Sisi – Campbell said he would email a statement later. In the emailed statement, received several hours after his first text reply, he apologised for the delay, which he said was due to him ‘trying to reach the person out there [Egypt] who asked me to visit – who is not Sisi btw [by the way]’. He also declined to respond to questions about whether he had met or spoken to Sisi, whether Mr Blair had brokered the meeting, his views on Sisi’s human rights record, whether he had been paid for his discussions with unnamed ‘officials and politicians’, and if so, how much. Mr Blair’s office did not respond to questions from this newspaper about whether he was involved in Campbell’s visit to Egypt or whether Blair himself was assisting Sisi. The former PM has made no secret of his support for Sisi. Sisi led a military coup of the country last year overthrowing the Muslim Brotherhood (its supporters pictured) Speaking earlier this year, he said: ‘The army have intervened, at the will of the people, but in order to take the country to the next stage of its development, which should be democratic. We should be supporting the new government in doing that.’ He came under fire from human rights campaigners who pointed out that in addition to the deaths and arrests of dissidents, 20 journalists had been referred to court on terrorism allegations, with severe curbs on the right to free assembly and free speech. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters are believed to have been killed in August 2013, when security forces stormed two protest camps set up by supporters of Mr Morsi demanding his reinstatement. Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, said at the time of Mr Blair’s remarks: ‘Dangerously, Blair and others are turning a blind eye to the suppression of human rights, the widespread arrests, the crackdown on freedom of media and the absence of rule of law.’","Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led Egypt's military coup, expects landslide victory .

"By . Sara Malm . A mother-of-four had told of how she cheated death when a fully grown deer fell through the windshield of her minivan. Heidi Conner was coming to the end of an eight hour road trip with her children when the deer slammed into her car after falling from a highway overpass near Barrington, Illinois. The adult female deer came through Ms Conner’s windshield as she was driving more than 70mph, but miraculously none of her children were hurt. SCROLL FOR VIDEO . Shock: Heidi Conner was driving her four children in a minivan on the interstate, when the deer came in through her windshield, near Barrington, Illinois . Ms Conner even managed to drive across three lines of traffic on the westbound Interstate 90 near Barrington with the dear next to her. She has a sore shoulder and some bruising, but somehow, she is otherwise unhurt. ‘I’m driving, everything was fine. Boom, and I have a deer lying next to me in my car,’ she told CBS2 Chicago. ‘If it had been one inch to the left, it would have been dead center. I wouldn’t have been able to control the car. And one inch to the right, it would have killed my son.’ Ms Conner’s children are completely unharmed, apart from the shock. Lucky: Ms Conner managed to steer though three lanes of traffic on the westbound Interstate 90 near Barrington - with the dead deer in her car . Incredible: Ms Conner's children are all unharmed, and she has a sore elbow, but other than that - the family escaped without injuries despite the unwelcome overpass guest . According to witnesses the deer fell or jumped from the Illinois 72 overpass onto the highway. First on the scene was Illinois Police State Trooper Justin Novarro, who said it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. ‘Never in my career have I seen anything like this,’ he told the TV station. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates there are approximately 1.5 million auto deer collisions per year. Illinois has the third most deer hits per year, only outdone by Pennsylvania and Michigan.","Heidi Conner was driving her four children in a minivan on the highway .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A woman who calls herself the 'Weed Fairy' is giving out free marijuana in Seattle by taping it to fliers in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Yeni Sleidi, 23, from California, says she is doling out the free pot to give people a break from everyday stress while visiting a friend in the Emerald City. 'I felt so relaxed about it... I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it elsewhere in the country,' she said or a recent legalization of marijuana in Washington state. Take this weed: Yeni Sledi is being called the 'Weed Fairy' for giving out free marijuana in Seattle . The fliers began appearing in the neighborhood known for its nightlife over Memorial Day weekend, and Sledi told KCPQ she has posted as many as 50. 'If you are around Capitol Hill you will probably see me,' she said. Sledi also wanted to assure people she has nothing but the best of intentions. 'I think people are a little worried, because this is something new, and suspicious,' she told the station. 'But it’s real weed and it’s not dangerous. It will get you high.' Reactions of people interviewed by station ranged from skeptical to enthusiastic, but Sledi says that people mostly laugh. 'I wouldn’t take anything for free from someone I didn’t know,' said resident Jvon Spann. I would smell it and if it’s good and I could tell it was good, then perhaps,' Corey Kimball added. Doing her part: Sledi said she feels comfortable giving away free marijuana in Seattle and that she is not concerned the police will bother her . She claimed to have first came up with the idea in New York, where she lived during the government shutdown, because several of her friends were affected by it. Sledi wanted to distract them from the stress. Her actions, though, drew plenty of coverage from the media. 'I'm not sure what the thought process was but I thought people would be amused by it,' she said. The fliers posted in Seattle came with the message: 'These are tough times. Take this weed.' Washington is one of two states that legalized recreational marijuana in 2012. Sleidi said it was the first time she felt comfortable with attaching her name to her deeds. Free to take: Small nuggets of marijuana are taped to each flier and are free for anyone to take . [The police] probably have worse things to worry about,' she told the station. 'I don’t think they will come after the Weed Fairy.' A Seattle Police spokesperson admitted to the station that officials aren't overly concerned about the Sledi's actions, but did say cops hope the pot does not fall into the hands of a minor. Sledi also wrote on her Tumblr that she hopes to start a wave of pot giving. 'I hope I can start a group of weed fairies and we can all get the world high.'","Yeni Sledi has been sharing her stash with the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood .

Today it emerged Farzana's family will be tried in an anti-terrorism in the city after Shahbaz Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab province, ordered the maximum punishments must be an option for all those accused of the honour killing. Yesterday Farzana's husband made the shock confession that he had killed his first wife in order to marry her.

During the assault she was hit on the head and died . 25-year-old Farzana was on her way to . court with her husband on Tuesday when they were attacked by a group of . her relatives who objected to her marriage. During the assault she was . hit on the head with bricks from a nearby construction site and died. The shocking case has focused attention on violence against women in Pakistan as well as the country's legal system. Sitting beside his late wife's grave in . the small village of Chak today, Mr Iqbal said he hoped Farzana's killers 'die in pain' and vowed to fight for justice. He also claimed that the same family members had previously poisoned Farzana's sister Rehana Parvana in a separate honour killing. Nayab Haider Rizvi, spokesman for the Lahore police force, today said that four men had been arrested late last night in a village in the Nankana district in connection with Farzana's death. Officers have already arrested the . woman's father and say he has confessed to the killing. They are looking . for two of her brothers. Meanwhile in Lahore's High Court earlier in the day, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif ordered that those accused of Farzana's murder be tried in an anti-terrorism court.

Hundreds . of women in conservative, Muslim-majority Pakistan are murdered each . year in so-called 'honor killings' by their husbands or male relatives . over alleged sexual transgressions seen as bringing shame to the family. Activists say those who commit such crimes are often acquitted or given light sentences. Earlier Mr Iqbal berated the police for refusing to save his late wife. He said that police did nothing during the 15 minutes the violence lasted outside Lahore High Court. 'I . begged them to help us but they said, this is not our duty... I took off my shirt [to show humility] and begged them . to save her,' he said. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has demanded to know why police apparently stood by, his spokesman said today. Sharif . had taken notice of the 'brutal killing' in the presence of police, his . press office said in a statement, adding that a 'totally unacceptable' crime had to be dealt with promptly by law. 'I am . directing the chief minister to take immediate action and a report must . be submitted by this evening to my office,' it said, quoting Sharif.

Last . night Farzana's body was buried in the presence of some 100 mourners from her . husband's family at around 2 a.m. in a village graveyard in Pakistan's . eastern Punjab province. Mr Iqbal said his family had chosen to bury her at night because of the gruesome state of her remains. Police initially said Farzana had been stoned, but said today that relatives had swung bricks, not thrown them. All the suspects, except the father, who has been detained, initially disappeared. A police officer on Tuesday quoted the father as saying it had been an honour killing. The 25-year-old had offended her family by marrying Iqbal instead of a cousin selected for her. Muhammad . Aurangzeb, Farzana's 20-year-old stepson, described how one relative . had tried to shoot her, then grabbed her head scarf, causing her to fall . over. While a member of Iqbal's party wrestled the gun away, a female cousin grabbed a brick and hit Farzana with it, he said. 'She . was screaming and crying 'don't kill me, we will give you money',' said . Iqbal. He said he tried to save her but the mob of more than 20 beat . him back. At one point, six people were beating her with bricks as she screamed, he said, and he and his stepson begged police to help. Finally she stopped screaming.

The . couple had been due to testify there that morning that their marriage . was genuine in response to a false charge of kidnapping brought by . Farzana's family. It was not the first time her family had tried to kill the woman, said her lawyer, Rai Ghulan Mustafa.

"By . Glen Owen . 'Better think again': Chancellor George Osborne is said not to be pleased with the demands . MPs are demanding an extraordinary £4billion of taxpayers’ money to refurbish the Houses of Parliament, The Mail on Sunday has learned. The huge sum - enough to build 200 secondary schools - is needed to correct ‘structural problems’, say MPs. Chancellor George Osborne has been warned by Cabinet colleague Andrew Lansley, the Leader of the House, that a ‘capital spending bid’ running into ‘several billions of pounds’ is being prepared by the Palace authorities and will land on the Chancellor’s desk this autumn. Commons sources say the total amount demanded will be £4billion, with a further £1billion in a ‘contingency reserve’. It is understood Mr Osborne reacted with fury when he was informed about the imminent demand, telling aides: ‘They had better think again.’ The whopping bill comes at a time when the Chancellor is insisting that his austerity measures, including welfare cuts  and public sector pay restraints, need to continue until at least 2018 to balance the books. It also coincides with continuing public hostility towards MPs over their taxpayer-funded expenses claims and an 11 per cent pay hike promised after the 2015 Election. However, a senior Commons source said last night: ‘There is no alternative to this. It sounds a lot, but it amounts to £400million a year over a decade, or £200 million over two decades, depending on the timescale for the work, which is peanuts for the Treasury. We can’t just let the 1,000-year-old mother of all Parliaments fall into ruins.’ The row comes after surveyors hired by the House of Commons Commission – the group of MPs chaired by Speaker John Bercow that supervises its administration – found chronic subsidence in the building, partly linked to the digging of the London Underground Jubilee Line in the 1990s. Crumbling: Surveyors looked over the Palace of Westminster and found that cracks in the walls, fire hazards and safety risks . One report found that Big Ben is tilting 18in from the vertical, while cracks have appeared in the walls of the Palace. Engineers fear the ancient piping system, including boilers dating from before the Second World War, is ‘ready to blow’, while the building is also suffering from electrical problems, fire risks and multiple safety hazards. They say there needs to be a staged shutdown, section by section, over ten to 20 years while the infrastructure is replaced. The £4billion cost, which comes as MPs prepare to return this week for the State Opening of Parliament, would be enough to build 13 hospitals at £300 million each. The Commons chamber itself also needs extensive work and at some point during the next Parliament will have to be shut for 18 months. MPs are expected to relocate to the Lords, with peers probably meeting in the QE2 conference centre opposite Westminster Abbey. Relocate: The chamber of the House of Commons will need to close for 18 months during the next parliament . Building costs at the Commons have a history of overrunning. When Portcullis House, the office building for MPs, was designed in 1992, it was projected to cost £165 million, but by the time it was finished in 2001 the bill had spiralled to £235 million. A spokesman for Mr Lansley said: ‘These discussions are at  a very early stage and the contractors have been asked  to report back with more cost-effective options.’ Last night a Treasury source said: ‘A bid of that scale will not be approved.’ A Commons spokesman said: ‘In 2012, a study on the condition of the Palace showed that unless significant restoration work is undertaken, irreversible damage may be done to the Grade I listed building. Both Houses agreed that doing nothing was not an option and asked for an independent appraisal of a range of options. ‘This appraisal is under way. The priority will be to ensure value for money for the taxpayer while safeguarding the heritage of the Palace. The decision will be taken in the next Parliament.’","Huge sum is needed to correct 'structural problems' in ancient building .

"By . Amanda Williams . Digital currencies like Bitcoin are fast becoming the weapon of choice for divorcing spouses trying to hide wealth from partners during court battles, it has emerged. A number of forums devoted to Bitcoin have been filled with husbands discussing the option of using digital currencies, a London divorce lawyer has claimed. It comes as courts are facing more legal . battles from divorcing spouses who claim the other side has tried to . conceal their wealth. It is feared that spouses . could use Bitcoin to hide wealth by transferring the currency between online . wallets, to friends, or to areas outside of legal jurisdiction. New weapon: Digital currencies such as Bitcoin are fast becoming the weapon of choice for divorcing spouses trying to hide currency from their partners . Ayesha . Vardag said that more divorce lawyers could start including digital . currency in financial disclosure orders if there is evidence they have . been used. She told the Financial Times: 'They . can be used to run a parallel economy. 'People will go to . immense lengths... as a spousal claim is more damaging than tax . because it is half your wealth.' Frank Arndt, head of international . family law at Stowe Family Law, also told the paper that Bitcoins may need to be disclosed as an asset in divorce cases. He said: 'Husbands are . becoming more and more creative in terms of what they do to reduce their . wealth and the courts are struggling to catch up. It’s just like when . the internet started and it was difficult for courts to catch up.' Bitcoin is an entirely virtual currency that works without the need for a central bank, and can be sent over the internet. It is feared that divorcing spouses could hide their wealth by transferring the currency between online wallets, to friends, or to areas outside of legal jurisdiction . Bitcoin is a virtual currency that works without the need for a central bank, and can be sent over the internet . Coins . are transferred directly from person to person and are kept in a . digital wallet that can be accessed on a computer or mobile device. Creating . new coins is done through a process called 'mining' where users are . rewarded with new coins for verifying transactions that take place. The . process is open source and can therefore be used by anyone, with more . and more mainstream businesses now accepting the currency as a form of . payment. Courts in California are already beginning to . issue search and discovery orders of assets - including digital . currencies such as Bitcoin. What is a bitcoin? Bitcoins are just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. They are the basic unit of a new online economy which runs independently of any company, bank, or government. Because . Bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting . involved, they have become popular with libertarians as well as . technophiles, speculators — and criminals. Who's behind the currency? It's . a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people . operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small . clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto . dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to attract widespread attention, . but proponents say that doesn't matter; the currency obeys its own, . internal logic.What's a bitcoin worth?Like . any other currency, Bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your . counterpart want them to be. In its early days, boosters swapped Bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game. One website . even gave them away for free. As the market matured, the value of each Bitcoin grew. At its height three months ago, a single Bitcoin was . valued at $1,200. On Tuesday, it was around $500.Is the currency widely used?That's . debatable. Businesses ranging from blogging platform Wordpress to . retailer Overstock have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of . media coverage, but it's not clear whether the currency has really . taken off. On the one . hand, leading Bitcoin payment processor BitPay works with more than . 20,000 businesses — roughly five times more than it did last year. On . the other, the total number of Bitcoin transactions has stayed roughly . constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over the same period, . according to Bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info.Is Bitcoin particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting?The Bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals' greed for the collective good. A . network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by . pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally . of every bitcoin transaction. The . blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and . the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the . occasional Bitcoin.

"By . Glen Owen . Revolving door: Ministers are backing legislation to stop employees taking five-figure pay outs then returning . Public sector ‘fat cats’ who bank huge redundancy payments before finding a new job funded by the taxpayer will be targeted in Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech. Ministers are planning to introduce legislation to claw back the pay-offs from employees earning more than £100,000 a year if they take a new job in the same part of the public sector within a year of redundancy. The crackdown on the so-called ‘revolving door’ scam is designed to meet public outrage over the number of executives who bank the money without using it to sustain them through a period of unemployment. Over the past three years more than 3,200 National Health Service bureaucrats have been handed pay-offs before walking into new jobs in the health service. Some have landed six-figure roles just three months after receiving packages of more than £600,000, and in one case a husband-and-wife team walked away with £1 million in redundancy only to find new six-figure positions within the NHS almost immediately. Out of 37 council chief executives who left by mutual agreement from 2007 to 2009, 16 per cent were working in another council within a year. And at the BBC, over the past decade 233 staff who were made redundant have later rejoined the Corporation – such as Matthew Bannister, the former head of Radio 1, who received a £200,000 severance payment in 2000, only to rejoin two years later as a presenter. The provisions, which are contained in the Small Business Bill, will allow for a portion of the pay-off to be clawed back depending on the length of time between exit and re-employment. Although some public sector organisations already have such arrangements in place, ministers say the legislation will ensure ‘consistency and fairness across the whole of the sector’. The proposals, which apply to cash payments and pension top-ups, will include a legal requirement for individuals to notify their previous employer that they will need to repay compensation. At the BBC, 233 staff members made redundant over the past decade have returned after receiving pay outs . Failing to do so will give their employer the right to dismiss them or sue them for the money. A consultation on the new law will also look at clawing back a smaller proportion of pay-offs made to those managers earning less than £100,000. The only people exempted will be those working for the Armed Forces, National Museums and ‘some majority state-owned financial institutions’. Nicky Morgan, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘We must make sure hard-earned taxpayers’ money is not being squandered.’","Ministers backing legislation to block employees returning after payout .

"By . Sally Lee . and Sarah Michael . and Freya Noble . Clive Palmer has apologised to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief-of-staff for personally attacking her over the government's paid parental leave scheme. The Palmer United Party leader used parliamentary debate on Monday to suggest Peta Credlin would receive a 'massive benefit when she gets pregnant' on the scheme, and suggested she was somehow responsible for it. Mr Palmer said he was unaware Ms Credlin had unsuccessful attempts to conceive through IVF and wrote a letter of apology on Tuesday morning. 'I did that well before this was a big controversy,' he said. Scroll down for video . Apologised: MP and mining magnate Clive Palmer has written a letter of apology to Tony Abbott staffer Peta Credlin following comments he made claiming she was behind the paid parental leave scheme . 'I told her it was a matter of great regret if there was any way I offended her personally.' Mr Palmer however didn't back down entirely and again criticised the policy for favouring successful women, who are capable of looking after themselves, over battling stay-at-home mums. On Wednesday Prime Minister Tony Abbott hit back at Clive Palmer after the MP attacked Mr Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin and suggested that she has 'undue influence' over the PM. Mr Abbott addressed Mr Palmer's offensive comment, in which he said the Federal Government had designed the paid parental leave scheme 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant'. Mr Abbott on Wednesday said: 'Well I think that blokes around this place have learned to underestimate women at their peril. I'll just make that general observation.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott weighed in on the controversy over Clive Palmer's comments about the PM's chief of staff Peta Credlin on Wednesday . He added: 'The other observation that I'll make is that the gentlemen in question does not understand the Coalition's policy... that all Australian women have access to the paid parental leave scheme. 'Before he goes out and attacks people he really ought to understand the policy.' It comes after Deputy Leader of the National Party, Barnaby Joyce, on Tuesday made a sexist joke at Ms Credlin's expense while addressing the controversy over Mr Palmer's comments. On Channel Ten's The Project Mr Joyce claimed that it is rare to see women in a powerful position as these roles are often held by men. 'Peta's got a strong role,' Mr Joyce. 'The Prime Minister is definitely the boss but if you step on Peta's toes she'll put her boot up your backside.' Glamorous and influential: Peta Credlin, who posed for this shot in the January edition of Marie Claire last year, is the best known woman in Canberra and has a powerful political rapport with Prime minister Tony Abbott . Deputy Leader of the National Party Barnaby Joyce makes a sexist joke at the expense of Prime Minister's chief of staff Peta Credlin on Channel Ten's The Project on Tuesday night . But when he was asked whether he thought the public found it unusual to see a woman holding such a position of power, he said: 'I'm on good information from her husband that she is a woman.' Once he realised his error, Mr Joyce quickly apologised and said: 'it was an attempt at humour'. Mr Joyce also somewhat defended Palmer by claiming earlier in the interview that he too had 'a whole litany of dopey things I've done in my time in politics'. Palmer, the MP for Fairfax in Queensland, made headlines after he attacked Ms Credlin in parliamentary debate on Monday, saying the Federal Government had designed the paid parental leave scheme 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant'. Government MPs were quick to condemn Mr Palmer's comment, however Ms Credlin has previously been credited with being the 'power' and the 'brains' behind the prime minister and the person he is 'closest to politically'. Mr Palmer's comments prompted a rebuke from senior members of the Coalition, with Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop pulling out of a scheduled dinner with the Queensland mining magnate after labelling his comments 'offensive and inappropriate', the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Politically close: Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured with Peta Credlin) is politically closest to his powerful chief of staff, who even members of his own party say he relies on heavily and respects her judgment . Thr right stuff: The tall, glamorous and highly intelligent Ms Credlin is the most discussed woman in Canberra. Clive Palmer's comments echo previous assessments from within Tony Abbott's own party that she is 'widely believed to have more influence over the way the country is run than most' MPs, who she describes as 'the front men' Canberra correspondents, a member of Mr Abbott's own party and a senior official told Good Weekend last year Ms Credlin had more influence than many MPs and her role was more like the chief of staff of a US president, 'with cabinet-level status'. Dubbed 'Ms Fix-it', Credlin was 'the most discussed woman in Canberra, and probably the most powerful'. Ms Credlin, 43, who has been married to Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, since 2001, has been on an IVF programme. She told marie claire magazine in January last year the prime minister was deeply supportive of her efforts to have a child through IVF with her husband and said Mr Abbott’s views on abortion, contraception and IVF were far more balanced than many people believe. Time to question: MP Clive Palmer's criticism of Peta Credlin (pictured with Tony Abbott during question time in the House of Representatives) was that the influence she wields should not supersede that of MPs.  'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do' Power behind the throne: Billionaire MP Clive Palmer's claims the government's paid parental leave scheme was designed 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff (Peta Credlin, pictured) can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant' have been widely condemned as insensitive to Ms Credlin who has struggled to conceive on an IVF programme. But the 43-year-old is widely regarded as the 'power' and the 'brains' behind Tony Abbott . The normally private Ms Credlin came under fire then from the Labor Party, which claimed a member of Mr Abbott's personal staff should not use a public forum to overcome Mr Abbott's perceived popularity problem at the time with women voters. Mr Palmer said he was not aware of Ms Credlin's personal struggles. The 60-year-old mining magnate denied he was being sexist, telling reporters in Canberra, 'I believe as chief of staff, regardless of whether she is a woman or man, she exercises undue influence on government policy to the detriment of many of the elected members of parliament'. He said he had made the comments because they concerned government policy. Calling the shots: Peta Credlin's influence on Prime Minister Tony Abbott is such that journalists say when Mr Abbott made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school' she 'gave him a swift kick in the shin. . . it was done with good humour, but for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.' 'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do.' A senior Liberal told Good Weekend last year that Mr Abbott, 'relies on her heavily and respects her judgment' and that 'she is the person in politics he's closest to, no doubt about that.' Seven network political correspondent Mark Riley gave an account of Mr Abbott and Ms Credlin on the way back from an overseas trip in 2013 when the prime minister made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school'. 'She gave him a swift kick in the shin,' Riley said, 'It was done with good humour. But for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.' But the government's frontbencher Christopher Pyne has described Mr Palmer's comments as 'cowardly' and 'ignorant', saying the paid parental leave scheme was proposed before Ms Credlin worked for Mr Abbott. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped Mr Palmer reflected on his 'hurtful' comments about Ms Credlin. 'For him to single her out is a particularly hurtful thing for him to do,' she told Sky News. Nationals MP Darren Chester said he was disgusted with Mr Palmer's comments, and worried about the tone of parliamentary debate when unelected staffers were drawn in and 'personally vilified'. Struggle to conceive: Ms Credlin, 43, who has been married to Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, since 2001, last year revealed their battle to have children . 'It was unnecessary for Mr Palmer to be so personally vindictive in the comments he made,' he told reporters, 'he should apologise.' Liberal MP Dennis Jensen said staffers were not 'fair game' in parliament. 'The people who to a certain extent are fair game are us as politicians, but once again it shouldn't get down to personal invective,' Dr Jensen said. 'You should deal with issues, not with personalities.' Nationals MP Andrew Broad, who tweeted his disapproval of the 'gutter politics' after Mr Palmer made the statement, added the comments were hurtful for couples like he and his wife who had also struggled with fertility. 'People expect better of members of parliament,' he said.","Clive Palmer wrote letter of apology to Ms Credlin over personal attack .

Stars of new Second World War film Woman in Gold, starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds, could be seen filming at Shoreham Airport in West Sussex dressed in full Nazi uniform today. Some rode around on motorbikes, while others could be seen climbing in and out of military vehicles. Pictures from the scene also showed two swastika flags erected just metres from a war memorial. Two flags with swastikas were erected outside a West Sussex airport today during filming of Woman in Gold - just 24 hours before the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landing in Normandy, France .

Huge panels displaying the Nazi emblem were also hung from outside the airport. Witnesses say they could be seen from hundreds of metres away. Local residents today reacted in anger at the filming - which comes just 24 hours before veterans across the world honor the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. Councillor Peter Metcalfe, a war veteran who was in the army for 11 years, branded the move 'insensitive', 'shocking' and 'crazy'.

An actor stands next to several period vehicles during filming - which took place just a few hours before veterans around the world honour the 70th D-Day anniversary . He said: 'I'm shocked. I had no idea they were flying swastika flags at the airport. 'It's very insensitive given the timing. I think it is crazy. I can totally understand why locals are upset - I am myself. 'They should stop filming immediately and show a bit more respect. They should cease filming for the rest of the weekend while we honour the D-Day anniversary. 'As much as we welcome filming in this area as it brings in jobs and work, I don't think it's right. Not at this time. I am going to go down there first thing to ensure filming is stopped.' One local, who did not wish to be named, said: 'There were about 150 cast and crew there. It was a real operation. Lots of them were in 1940s gear. A group of extras gather during a break.

'There were three massive great bit swastika flags flying high above the airport. They were so close to the war memorial. 'It wouldn't take much thought to realise how insensitive it is to put them up just before D-Day. It is unbelievable. 'Clearly no consideration was made to the sensitivity of locals and residents around there. Lots of people just couldn't believe it. 'It makes me think the crews just can't have spotted the war memorial. Putting those flags up is so thoughtless.' The witness said they could not see either Helen Mirren or Ryan Reynolds on site today. They added they believed the flags would be left there overnight. Actors drive through a temporary check point in a military vehicle during filming . Later on in the day, an airplane was seen parked outside the airport. Neither of the film's big stars Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds were scene on location today . Lloyd Dean wrote on Facebook: 'There's some nazi film being made at shoreham airport wtf so sick.' The filming comes just months after producers of Brad Pitt movie Fury filmed Nazi war scenes early in the morning on Remembrance Sunday. American director David Ayer staged pre-dawn explosions in Shirburn, Oxfordshire and had extras act out battle scenes dressed as Nazis while the rest of the country readied itself to honour the nation's fallen heroes. Bosses behind the film reportedly refused to stop filming over the weekend, despite a plea from the nearby Watlington Parish Council.

Allison Smith was at The Children's Hospital at Westmead when a centre volunteer told her she couldn't feed Charlie in a public lunch area. Instead, the 32-year-old claims she was forced into breastfeeding her son in a 'disgusting' storeroom strewn with toys. Scroll down for video . A volunteer at The Children's Hospital at Westmead told Allison Smith that she couldn't breastfeed seven-month-old Charlie (top left) in the children's lunch area on Monday. Ms Smith is pictured cuddling her two-year-old son, Henry (bottom left) 'A staff member came up to me and said ""you can't breastfeed there"",' Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia. 'She said ""you can feed your baby in the storeroom"". 'So I went to the storeroom and fed, they peered through the window and retorted that I wasn't even feeding. I returned the next day and fed in the dining area and they made remarks to each other, one stating that her daughter used a cover. 'They were just being bullies.' 'I was distressed and embarrassed,' said Ms Smith. 'I thought I was allowed to breastfeed freely in Australia.' This not only came as a shock to Ms Smith, a single mother of boys Charlie and two-year-old Henry who both have rare and complex medical conditions, but also to pro-breastfeeding group Lactivists Australia. In light of the incident, the activist group will lead a 'nurse-in' peaceful protest at the hospital, also known as Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, on Friday afternoon in order to raise awareness about the kind of discrimination faced by breastfeeding mothers.

Brothers Henry (left) and Charlie (right) who both have rare and complex medical conditions . 'Time and again we are seeing women made to feel ashamed simply for breastfeeding,' spokeswoman for the group Victoria Brookman said. 'For some reason, some people have it in their minds that they have a right to discriminate against a breastfeeding mother.' Ms Brookman wants today's message to be plain and clear: 'it is illegal and unacceptable to ask a mother not to breastfeed, to cover up or to move elsewhere'. 'A woman's right to breastfeed her child is protected under The Sex Discrimination Act (1984) protects a woman's right to breastfeed anytime, anywhere.' The hospital has since apologised to Ms Smith, stating that it was a 'misunderstanding'. But Ms Smith said this wasn't the case. 'I value and respect the assistance of the care team at the hospital but there was no misunderstanding on Monday. It was directive and the rude remarks solidified my perception,' she said. 'The hospital said there are dedicated areas for feeding. I said my body is capable of and designed to feed anywhere.' Ms Smith is currently raising funds for both her ill children. Her youngest son Charlie survived a stroke within 24 hours of birth but now suffers from apnoea and seizures. Her eldest, Henry, is hypertensive as he is missing the two crucial arteries - one to each kidney. As a result, he suffers from very high blood pressure. To donate, click here.

Headliners . for this year’s event are Arcade Fire, Kasabian and Metallica, with . acts such as Robert Plant and Dolly Parton also among those who will . play. It . will be spread across all BBC channels, as well as Radio One, Radio . Two, iPlayer, the red button and the BBC website, including an edition . of The One Show from the festival site in Somerset. Coverage will be . hosted by a team of 17 presenters including including Jo Whiley, Fearne Cotton, . Dermot O’Leary, Lauren Laverne, Steve Lamacq, Greg James, Stuart . Maconie, Pete Tong, Cerys Matthews and Mark Radcliffe, with Chris Evans . and Alex Jones hosting the Glastonbury edition of The One Show. The BBC . said the number of employees going to the festival is reflective of the . ‘demanding workload’ and that all 300 have a ‘clear and accountable’ role. The BBC is broadcasting 30 hours of TV coverage across its channels and more than 50 hours of radio . By comparison, this year’s World Cup coverage has seen a reduction in numbers on the 295 who staffed the South African contest. John O’Connell, . director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, branded it an ‘inappropriate’ use . of resources, saying: ‘Taxpayers will be deeply suspicious that their . money is being used to send staff on a jolly. ‘The . BBC is already sending 272 people to Brazil for the World Cup, and . sending another 300 to Glastonbury does seem like overkill. People will . be watching the coverage closely – it had better be worth the expense.’ Last year the BBC faced similar criticism after spending £2million sending a 296-strong team to the festival. There . were further complaints over the quality of broadcasts, with music fans . branding presenters ‘annoying’ and accusing them of filling time with . ‘boring chit chat’. BBC . music chief Bob Shennan yesterday defended this year’s staffing . decision, saying: ‘We’re sending the same number of people as last year . and, whilst some will inevitably still argue this is too many, I can . assure you that every member of staff on-site has a clear and . accountable role, working long hours to offer unparalleled coverage for . our audience. ‘We have worked hard in recent years to identify areas where resources can be shared or tasks more easily undertaken off-site.’ Metallica have proved a controversial headliner with some festival-goers unhappy they are topping the bill . 'Whilst we are working hard to ensure we are being as efficient as possible, we will not compromise the quality of our output and we have been robust in scrutinising our plans and minimising costs.' Metallica have proved a controversial booking for the event with some festival-goers unhappy that a hard rock act are topping the bill. Some have said the group’s inclusion is against the event’s environmental ethos, as frontman James Hetfield supports bear hunting. Mr Shennan said he hoped the BBC coverage of the band’s performance would do justice to their renowned 'powerful, pyrotechnical performances'. But he added: 'If metal isn’t your cup of tea however, there will be plenty of alternatives just a few clicks away on your tablets or interactive TVs.' A BBC . spokesman said: 'Broadcasting comprehensive, high-quality coverage of . major cultural events requires this level of resource and every member . of staff onsite has a clear and accountable role, working long hours to . offer more than 250 hours of unrivalled coverage across to audiences . across TV, radio and online.","This compares to 272 who are heading to Brazil for the World Cup .

"By . Sally Lee . It's been a dismal start to the Australian snow season this year as snow slopes have been uninvitingly bare and brown. While it's usual for snow fall to be infrequent this early in the season, temperatures have been too warm for snow machines to be brought out by ski resorts. And it doesn't look very promising as snow forecaster Peter Taylor says it's going to be an average season. Despite the slow start to the snow season due to warm weather, families enjoyed Thredbo Ski Resort's opening weekend celebrations . One snow gun was used at Thredbo on Friday night . Mr Taylor, the operator of snowatch.com.au, said this hasn't been a good start to the season which officially begun on Friday. 'It's been very slow,' he said. 'But there usually isn't enough snow at the start of the season. 'Although warmer temperatures meant that snow machines couldn't be used until last night. 'They usually bring out the snow guns two weeks prior but it was too warm to do that this year.' This was the case at Thredbo as their spokeswoman Susie Diver confirmed they only brought out their snow guns last night. Snow forecaster Peter Taylor predicts it will be another average year for snowfall this year . Mr Taylor also believes it will be a slow start to the snow season this year. Pictured is an Australian ski resort, Thredbo, on Friday . 'But the temperatures dropping now and we’re expecting to see a few centimetres of snow tonight,' Mr Taylor said. He predicts that the snow season will be 'average' this year but it'll certainly be better than the last. 'Thankfully season 2013 is well and truly behind us as it was one of the worst seasons on record,' he said. 'And because of the El Nino patterns, we're less likely to get a good season this time round but it'll definitely be better than last year.' Thredbo’s spokeswoman Susie Diver said there probably won’t be enough snow for skiing and snow boarding this long weekend. ‘But we can't be too sure as it's very unpredictable,' she said. Despite the minimal snowfall, Thredbo are gearing up for the Queen's Birthday long weekend. Temperatures have been too warm for ski resorts to use their snow machines .

"By . Belinda Robinson . A teenage hoaxer told police a bomb was set to explode at a packed shopping centre - so his fed-up brother could finish his shift at Burger King early. Luke Brown, 18, called 999 and claimed there was a device in the Castle Mall food court in Norwich city centre which was due to go off in six hours time. But the crazy stunt went wrong immediately as cops swooped on the phone box where he was on Long John Hill and arrested him, a court heard on Friday. Bomb threat: Luke Brown, 18, called 999 and claimed there was a bomb set to explode - to get his brother out of work at Burger King in Norwich . Furious police last night blasted Brown's incredible 'stupidity' after he was locked up for six months. He was also rapped as being childish and immature by his own solicitor. After the bomb threat was made, the shopping complex was quickly searched and cleared by police but no-one was evacuated. Brown, of Norwich, admitted making the bomb hoax on March 6. He told police his brother was working in Burger King and 'wanted to go home early' so he'd asked if he could ring police and 'make something up'. Brown asked to enter the witness box at Norwich Crown Court yesterday to tell Judge Stephen Holt he was 'very sorry'. Sentencing the teenager to six months in a young offenders' institution, Judge Holt said it was an 'unsophisticated prank' and branded Brown a 'foolish young man'. But he said he would be 'failing in his public duty' if he did not pass an immediate custodial sentence. Bomb: The teenager told police a device was in the Castle Mall food court, pictured, in Norwich city centre and was due to go off in six hours time . Judge Holt told Brown: 'People must learn that you cannot send out bomb hoaxes because if you do you will end up in prison.' Richard Kelly, prosecuting, said police carried out a 'discreet search' of the busy shopping centre but quickly established it was a hoax. Mr Kelly said nine police officers, two police community support officers, a dog unit and a crime scene investigator all rushed to the scene. Michael Clare, defending, said Brown, who suffers from learning difficulties and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, pleaded guilty and had been a 'stupid boy'. Mr Clare said it was 'far removed from the sort of thing' that was 'politically motivated' or something that was 'criminally sophisticated'. He said: 'It's a childish immature prank by someone who is seriously academically challenged.' Speaking after the case, Superintendent Neil Baily, of Norfolk Police, said: 'It's astonishing to think of the stupidity of someone who would call to make a bomb hoax just to get his brother off work early. 'In any case our priority is the safety of the public and we have to treat these incidents seriously from the outset. Hoax calls are not victimless crimes. 'They create fear and disruption to the community and also require a significant amount of resource from emergency services.' He stressed: 'The sentence underlines the seriousness of deliberately wasting police time and taking resources away from legitimate demands. 'We will always seek to prosecute where appropriate and I hope this case acts as a warning to others.'","Luke Brown, 18, called 999 and claimed a bomb was set to go off at a shopping centre in Norwich .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A gang of armed robbers stole more than £1 million of jewellery in a city centre raid, it has been revealed. Three men threatened staff with knives and swords, and smashed open display cases at the Hamilton & Inches store in George Street, Edinburgh at around 11.30am yesterday. They made their escape in a white BMW car, driven by a fourth man, which was seen to drive east along George Street, down Howe Street and along Heriot Row. Theft: Armed robbers threatened staff at Hamilton & Inches in Edinburgh before smashing display cases. They made off with around £1million worth of jewellery, police confirmed today . The car was recovered by police a short time later and is currently being forensically examined. Police initially appeal for any witnesses yesterday but did not put a value on the stolen goods. A force spokesman said today that a full inventory of the stolen items is being carried out and it is estimated that over £1 million of valuables were taken. Detective Inspector Craig Finnie said: 'Staff were left extremely shaken and a major investigation is under way to trace those responsible.' 'While we remain keen to speak with witnesses who were in the George Street area at the time of the robbery, we also wish to trace anyone who remembers seeing both getaway vehicles in the Gloucester Lane area before or after the crime was committed. 'Furthermore, anyone with any further information relevant to this inquiry is also asked to contact police immediately.' Raid: The popular store, location pictured, was raided at 11.30am yesterday .

"By . Glen Owen . Warning: Rachel Reeves fears traditional voters are deserting Labour . Labour’s revolt over Ed Miliband’s leadership deepened last night after a member of his Shadow Cabinet declared the party was being deserted by its traditional supporters. Rachel Reeves – who has been tipped as a future leader of the party – became the first frontbencher to break ranks since Labour’s recent run of  poor election results. She warned Mr Miliband that his blue-collar supporters were abandoning the party for Ukip because Labour was taking them ‘for granted’. The party was beaten into second place by Ukip in last month’s European elections. On top of that it made only limited gains in the local council poll and came a distant third in last Thursday’s Newark by-election. Mr Miliband’s personal ratings have also remained persistently dire, leading many experts to question his credentials as a plausible Prime Minister. Ms Reeves, the Shadow Work  and Pensions Secretary, told a gathering of senior Labour figures on the day of the Newark poll that after several weeks ‘on the doorstep’ she had discovered that the party’s vote was plummeting in seats ‘that were previously safe’. She said: ‘Traditional voters, who perhaps at times we took for granted but had nowhere else to go, are now being offered an alternative by Ukip. ‘Our voters, if I can still call them that, see Ukip [as] a party who are offering a vision and a hope that things can be better. ‘They hear something from that party that resonates with them and with their fears for the future and that’s something very real that we have to contend with and it’s something real that  we have to contend with for  two reasons. ‘First of all, for purely electoral reasons, we have to hold on and build that coalition again of our traditional voters. ‘The Labour party came into existence to give a voice for ordinary working people. What I saw... were middle class, public sector, well-educated young graduates voting Labour, but the people who the Labour Party was set up to help, abandoning us.’ Ms Reeves, who worked as a Bank of England economist before being selected for Leeds West at the 2010 election on an all-women shortlist, concluded: ‘Our very raison d’etre will be threatened if the working people, who the Labour Party have got to be there for, and got to be a voice for, start to drift away because they don’t see us as the answer.’ New threat: Ms Reeves said Labour voters are being offered an alternative by Ukip, who beat the party in the Newark by-election. Pictured above are Newark Ukip candidate Roger Helmer, left, with leader Nigel Farage . She made her remarks at a conference branded ‘One Nation’  – the political slogan adopted by Mr Miliband – held at Queen Mary University of London, alongside other senior Labour figures including policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas and Shadow Health Minister Luciana Berger. Last week seven rebel Labour MPs, including Frank Field, Kate Hoey and John Mann, published an open letter to Mr Miliband which argued that the unrestricted entry of EU citizens from eastern  Europe since 2004 was hurting  the ‘very communities that the Labour Party was founded  to represent’. The MPs argued that concern with immigration had become an important priority for a large proportion of working-class and middle-class voters. They added: ‘While the benefits of mass migration have been served in abundance to many wealthy people, who are in a position to  take advantage of cheap labour,  we believe that the lack of affordable housing, school places, hospital capacity and transport infrastructure to accommodate  this influx of people means that poorer people’s living standards have been squeezed.’ Last night a spokesman for  Ms Reeves said: ‘The Labour Party is building support across Britain with our plans to freeze energy bills, guarantee patients a GP appointment within 48 hours and reform our banking system.’","Frontbencher Rachel Reeves broke ranks at a London conference this week .

The body of a 23-year-old Frenchman was recovered by police at 6.30pm on Sunday at an Australian National Heritage site in Sydney . Police said he had 'fallen closer to about 40 metres down the cliff face' at the Royal National Park . Mr Ardoin had been bushwalking through the National Park with a group of seven friends from Wollongong University, including his girlfriend, when he slipped down an embankment. It was first reported that the man had fell about 10 metres after losing his grip while hanging from a sandstone ledge on Sunday morning. They later confirmed he fell around 40 metres. A police spokeswoman told MailOnline investigators would be pursuing the suggestion that Ardoin was posing for a selfie when he lost his grip and plunged from the cliff as one of their lines of inquiry. His friends witnessed him fall north of Little Marley Beach and were assisting police with their inquires. Police found Ardoin's body with the help of State Emergency Services officers and Fire and Rescue crew. Inspector Mark Magrath, of Miranda local area command, earlier said police were trying to notify the man's next-of-kin overseas. Authorities tried to access the body by air but high winds and rough seas impeded recovery efforts. Five SES officers were called to the scene and rigged anchor points into the bedrock.

"By . Ap  Reporter . and Reuters . and Joel Christie . Mattresses, portable toilets and showers were brought in Saturday for 700 unaccompanied minors who spent the night sleeping on plastic cots inside an Arizona warehouse, a federal official said. A Homeland Security official told The Associated Press that about 2,000 mattresses have been ordered to the makeshift holding center — a warehouse that has not been used to house people in years. Gov. Jan Brewer's spokesman, Andrew Wilder, said Friday that conditions at the center are so dire that federal officials have asked the state to immediately ship medical supplies to the center in Nogales. Overflowing: The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing . The U.S. Department of Homeland Security started flying immigrants to Arizona from the Rio Grande Valley in Texas last month after the number of immigrants — including more than 48,000 children traveling on their own — overwhelmed the Border Patrol there. Immigrant families were flown from Texas, released in Arizona, and told to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office near where they were traveling within 15 days. ICE has said the immigrants were mostly families from Central America fleeing extreme poverty and violence. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no authorization to discuss the matter publicly, said the holding center opened for unaccompanied children because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had nowhere to turn. 'They became so overwhelmed and haven't kept up with planning,' the official said. At the holding center, vendors are being contracted to provide nutritional meals, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, meanwhile, will provide counseling services and recreational activities. Hundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from Central America and Mexico being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell . The Homeland Security official said . the number of children at the warehouse was expected to double to around . 1,400. The warehouse has a capacity of about 1,500. The . warehouse began housing children flown from South Texas last Saturday. About 400 were scheduled to arrive Friday but, because of mechanical . issues with the planes, only about 60 came, the Homeland Security . official said. Saturday's flights were canceled, also because of . mechanical problems. There are flights scheduled through mid-June. Federal . authorities plan to use the Nogales facility as a way station, where . the children will be vaccinated and checked medically. They will then be . sent to facilities being set up in Ventura, California; San Antonio, . Texas; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Wilder . said reports from consulates that the Department of Homeland Security . was stopping the program to fly migrant families to Arizona and then bus . them to Phoenix were incorrect. Instead, the program that has shipped . unknown thousands of adult migrants and their children to Arizona since . last month shows no sign of stopping, he said. 'The . adults, the adults with children, families — that continues unfettered . and we have no idea where they are going,' Wilder said. In . a statement Friday, Homeland Security officials said ""appropriate . custody determinations will be made on a case by case basis"" for . migrants apprehended in South Texas. Many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger . Lackland has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone . Brewer . sent an angry letter to President Barack Obama on Monday demanding that . the program of dropping off families at bus stations in Phoenix stop . immediately. She called the program dangerous and unconscionable, asked . for details and demanded to know why state authorities weren't consulted . or even informed. The governor said she hadn't received a response to her letter by Friday. 'I . have reached out to Federal Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson for . answers. Meanwhile, I reiterate my call on President Obama to secure our . southern border and terminate this operation immediately,' Brewer said . in a statement. Brewer's . staff spent Friday in a series of calls with officials from FEMA, . Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security. Wilder . said FEMA's Region 9 administrator was being sent to the holding center . in Nogales on Saturday to oversee efforts to deal with the hundreds of . arriving children. The . federal emergency supplies are held in Arizona warehouses, and Wilder . said the state is working to send them to the holding center. America has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease . About 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor . On . Friday night, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that young . lawyers and paralegals are being sought for the community service . program AmeriCorps to provide legal assistance in . immigration . proceedings to children who come to the U.S. illegally. Officials say . about 100 lawyers and paralegals will be enrolled as members of . AmeriCorps in a new division called 'justice AmeriCorps.' Immigration . officials can immediately return Mexican immigrants to the border, but . they are much more hard-pressed to deal with Central American migrants . who illegally cross into the U.S. In recent months, waves of migrants . from nations south of Mexico have arrived in Texas. The . Homeland Security official said that legally, only their parents or . guardians can take custody if the government makes the children eligible . for release. Officials . in Central America and Mexico have noticed a recent increase in women . and children crossing the border. Father Heyman Vazquez, the director of . a migrant shelter in Huixtla in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas, . said he and others advise children that it's too dangerous. Yet Vazquez is seeing more and more youths heading north. 'I . remember a little boy of 9 years old and I asked if he was going to go . meet someone and he told me ""No, I'm just going hand myself over because . I hear they help kids,""' Vazquez said. The perception that some immigrants could be getting a free pass into the U.S. could lead to more attempts to cross the border. President Barack Obama said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was an 'urgent humanitarian situation' More than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas since October last year, it has been reported . Illegal . immigration increased heavily under a 'catch-and-release' strategy . during the George W. Bush administration. Under that policy the . government issued notices to appear in immigration court to migrants . from countries other than Mexico until Bush stopped the practice. Federal . officials then established a 210-mile stretch of the Texas-Mexico . border as a zero-tolerance zone for illegal immigration. Instead of . merely getting sent back home, migrants were arrested, prosecuted and . sometimes sentenced to prison before being formally kicked out of the . country. By August 2006, border agents in the Del Rio, Texas, sector said daily arrests had dropped from 500 to fewer than 100. The . half-century-old section of a U.S. Air Force base in Texas has been . transformed into a holding and processing center for thousands of . children illegally crossing the border from Central and South America . without adults. Leaked . photos from the base obtained by Breitbart show hundreds of children . holed up in crowded concrete rooms, many of them sleeping on the bare . floor without blankets or pillows. Among . those children are Jose Maquez Soto, 12, who came from Honduras to the . United States and now rests on a bunk at Lackland Air Force Base in San . Antonio under a hand-drawn flag of his native country and a message . cheering the Honduran squad in the upcoming soccer World Cup. Jose . is one of the 60,000 'unaccompanied minors' - children under 18 - that . the Obama administration estimates will enter the United States . illegally this year. It . projects that number to grow to nearly 130,000 next year, creating what . the White House describes as an 'urgent humanitarian situation'. At the base, children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day. They can call home twice a week. They have access to mental health clinicians and on-site medical care . The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala . Nearly . 1,000 of the minors at a time are being sheltered at a facility built . about 50 years ago to house new recruits for basic training. The . boys and girls will pass along corridors with faded Air Force pictures . and new signs written in Spanish that point the way to the dining hall . and bathrooms. Since the facility opened three weeks ago, 1,820 children have passed through the center. About . 850 have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor, said . U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Jesus Garcia. The person who takes the child, Garcia says, has to agree to bring the child to an immigration hearing. The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. They are sometimes seeking to reunite with a parent who is already in the United States, also without documentation. Another facility for minors will open at Naval Base Ventura County in Southern California that will hold a maximum of 600 children. At Lackland, the children between the ages of 12 and 17 are handed several sheets and towels when they arrive and checked for lice and scabies. Republicans blame President Obama for the situation, pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the U.S. Photos leaked Thursday from a U.S. Border Patrol facility in the Rio Grande Valley show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants, many of whom are children . Over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the Mexican border illegally this year . They then undergo physical and mental health evaluations, and are assigned a metal bunk from among the rows that line the walls of large barracks-style rooms. There is little need for storage because, as social workers put it, few of these children arrived with anything other than the clothes they wore on their journey north. The administration estimates it costs taxpayers $252 per child per day. 'The reasons, as we understand them, that contribute to this dramatic increase have to do with economic conditions in those countries, sustained violence in these countries, and the desire of these children to be reunited with family members in the United States,' Celia Munoz, the White House Domestic Policy Adviser said.","Mattresses, portable toilets and showers were brought in for 700 minors who spent Friday night on plastic cots inside an Arizona warehouse .

"By . Lillian Radulova . and Sarah Michael . Treasurer Joe Hockey and Australian Greens Leader Christine Milne have become unlikely allies after both spoke up to support senator-elect Ricky Muir's shaky interview on Sunday night. The Motoring Enthusiasts Party senator-elect was the subject of ridicule following an excruciating weekend interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night, in which he struggled to explain his alliance with the Palmer United Party (PUP). 'Yes, it's the potential if, aah, say in this case Labor and the Greens, um, it's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances,' Mr Muir said in the interview. Scroll down for video . Newly-elected senator Ricky Muir got himself into a fluster during an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday night . Treasurer Joe Hockey (left) and Australian Greens Leader Christine Milne (right) came to Mr Muir's defence on Tuesday, saying he deserved sympathy for his nervousness . Set to become one of the most powerful players in Australian politics in less than a month, Senator Muir got flustered while talking about his political party's main topic of interest. But Mr Hockey - not known for mincing his words - and Senator Milne both said the novice politician shouldn't be judged on the interview. 'You've got to treat everyone with the same degree of respect, whether they're the most articulate or whether they're inarticulate, whether they're nervous or whether they're confident,' Mr Hockey said on Tuesday. 'I don't mind someone being nervous. I think it's very human.' Mike Willesee: Do you understand what balance of power means?Ricky Muir: Yes. It's the potential if... Ah, let's say in this case Labor and the Greens, um. It's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances.Correct answer: A balance of power (in reference to the Senate) is a position held by a minor party, independent or coalition which means their vote is necessary for legislation to be passed. MW: I don't know what you mean by [aftermarket industry]?RM: The aftermarket industry is the industry, um, that is... [To himself] Take a breath. Can I go out for a minute?Correct answer: The aftermarket automotive industry deals with car parts that are sold to consumers other than vehicle manufacturers (such as Ford or Holden). Aftermarket manufacturers make motor vehicle parts - such as tyres, seats, engines, batteries or brake pads - and sell to car repair shops or directly to consumers. The products are used to replace faulty parts, to modify cars or to maintain the performance of vehicles. And he thinks Mr Muir could follow in the footsteps of former member for North Sydney 'Silent Billy Jack'. 'As Bob Menzies said at a famous town hall meeting at North Sydney, he said: ""I'm the one that does the talking, and Billy does the voting"". And I suspect it might be the same with Ricky,' Mr Hockey said. Senator Milne said Mr Muir's election was simply down to 'a numbers game' but said he deserved sympathy over the interview, which caused some to question how he would represent Victoria in the upper house. 'It's a nerve-wracking time when you go into politics and so, to that extent, of course you have to feel sorry for people who are struggling with it,' Senator Milne told reporters in Hobart. The bigger question was how Mr Muir got elected with half of one per cent of the primary in the 2013 SA senate race, Senator Milne said. The long-serving Tasmanian senator said PUP leader Clive Palmer, who Mr Muir will back in a balance-of-power bloc when he begins his six-year term from July, and micro-parties consultant Glenn Druery, who guided the Motorists Enthusiasts Party on preference deals, had questions to answer about his election. 'What you can see is a numbers game going on,' Senator Milne said. She said Mr Muir had put himself forward for election and now had to represent his state as best he could. The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party senator struggled to answer questions about the automobile industry . 'Everybody who goes into the senate has to undertake to make a serious contribution and I presume that is his commitment to the Australian community,' she said. Mr Hockey in particular might be reluctant to go too hard on Mr Muir after his boss made a verbal gaffe of his own over the weekend. Prime Minister Tony Abbott immediately corrected himself after referring to 'Canadia' during an official trip, but audiences back home noted the slip and 'Canadia' was soon trending on Twitter. Mr Muir, from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, struggled to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the Senate . Veteran Seven reporter Mike Willesee asked Mr Muir to explain what he meant by the 'aftermarket' automobile industry, but the Victorian stumbled with his answer before taking a break. 'There's the aftermarket industry which can be supported ... people that are losing their jobs ... sorry ... can we start that question again?' Mr Muir said. 'There's the aftermarket industry ... which ... um ... sorry, can we go to another question? I've got myself into a fluster. 'The aftermarket industry is the industry that is ... can I go out for a minute?' After a short break, Mr Muir returns, and Mr Willesee advises him to answer questions as if he's talking to someone at a pub. Mr Muir, who has maintained his job at a timber mill ahead of the move to Canberra, also struggles to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the Senate. 'Yes, it's the potential if, aah, say in this case Labor and the Greens, umm, it's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances,' he said. PUP leader and businessman Clive Palmer on Monday attacked the Sunday Night program's story as 'biased and churlish'. 'Mike Willesee recorded about an hour of a really serious interview with me about political things and other things but he didn't show any of that,' he told ABC radio. 'He doesn't show you all of the footage. Just selective pieces.'","Joe Hockey and Greens Leader, Christine Milne, defended Mr Muir's blundering interview with Channel Seven on Sunday .

An affidavit says Pak also shot Thompson's mother twice but she survived by pretending to be dead. Thompson and Welch, along with Thompson's mother and her six-year-old son, were living in an apartment attached to Pak's home. Pak and his tenants were reportedly arguing about late rent and parking before the shooting. Pak, a 74-year-old Korean War orphan and . local business owner, lived in one half of the duplex and rented out . the other half. Neighbors described him as a 'horrible landlord,' with . an short temper who spied on the people who rented from him. Officers believed they had quelled an argument between the tenants and Pak.

This is the third time this month that police in a small town in the Northeast have responded to horrifying gun violence. Murdered: Derrick Thompson, 19, and his girlfriend, Alivia Welch, 18, were both killed in their apartment by their angry landlord, police say . Tragic: Alivia worked at a coffee shop in town and Derrick detailed cars at a local dealership. Both were just beginning their lives together . On December 14, 20 first graders and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in upscale Newtown, Connecticut. On Christmas Eve, a convicted felon shot dead two firefighters who were lured to their deaths when the gunman set fire to his home in the lakefront village of Webster, New York. Biddeford is a quiet city of 21,000 about 20 miles southeast of Portland. The Press Herald reports that police . believe the shooting came as a result of a landlord-tenant dispute over . parking at the house in the upscale neighborhood.

Police say the argument may have escalated to shoving. Horror: This Cape Cod-style duplex in an upscale Maine town was the scene of a horrible double murder on Saturday night . Officers said they calmed both the landlord and the tenants down and believed the argument was settled. Police left the house about 7pm. Just three minutes later, they received received reports of a shooting at the home. Officers returned to find Mr Thompson and his girlfriend Miss Welch shot to death and Ms Johnson wounded. Johnson was being treated for a gunshot wound at a Portland hospital and is in stable condition, officials said. Her younger son, Brayden, was not hurt. Detectives say Pak used a handgun in the shootings, but did not specify the make or model. Hiding: Brayden Johnson, 6, was told to hide in a back bedroom when the shooting began. His mother Susan Johnson was wounded . Ambitions: Alivia's Facebook page says she was studying nursing at the local community college . The young couple, along with Ms Johnson and her six-year-old son had been renting an apartment at the house since October. Pak and his wife lived in the other side of the house. Neighbors called Pak a 'horrible landlord' who never kept tenants for more than a year. Previous tenants complained about Pak peeking in their windows. Pak was known in his neighborhood as an exacting man with a violent temper, the Press Herald reports. He and his wife moved into the house five years ago and significantly renovated it. Andrew Lemelin, 19, who lives across the street from Pak, said he experienced Pak's temper last year when he was hired to do work for the elderly man. Pak was not satisfied with Mr Lemelin's performance and sent a letter to the teen's father demanding he return the wages he paid. Mr Lemelin told the Press Herald that when the family refused to give the money back, Pak began leaving angry, threatening messages on the family answering machine. 'He seemed like the kind of person who could deal without guns,' Mr Lemelin told the newspaper.","Police say James Pak shot three of his tenants after arguing with them over parking .

"By . Tara Brady . Gareth Chip cut off half of his neighbour's ear for turning down the oven in their communal kitchen when he realised something was burning . A thug who chopped off half of his neighbour’s ear for tampering with his food in their communal kitchen has been jailed. Steven Brown had turned down the gas when he realised something was burning in the shared oven and opened a window to let out the smoke. Newcastle Crown Court heard when Gareth Chip, 31, realised the cooking temperature had been adjusted on his supper, he threatened to stab Mr Brown before slicing off a large chunk of his left ear. The court heard the wound left blood 'streaming down like a tap'. Medics were able to re-attach the severed flesh back on to Mr Brown’s ear. Chip was jailed for six years for the attack at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday. Judge Simon Hickey told him: 'You brought a knife to the scene and cut off a person’s ear, or part of it. 'Fortunately, he had his ear sewed back on with 13 stitches. 'He was simply cooking in his kitchen, in an area shared by you and you took umbrage.' At the time of the attack Chip was on bail for punching a vulnerable man and stealing his rucksack in what the judge described as a 'mean' offence. Chip was given a further ten months behind bars for theft and common assault, which he admitted. The court heard Chip still denies he was the knifeman who attacked Mr Brown, who had to relive his ordeal from the witness box. Prosecutor Michael Hodson told the court: 'The defendant was cross about the temperature being turned down on the oven. 'He swung a knife at his head and cut his ear. Gareth Chip was jailed for six years at Newcastle Crown Court after he was found guilty of wounding with intent . 'He cut off part of the ear. It was stitched back on.' Chip, of Hylton Castle, Sunderland, denied he knew anything about the attack. He was tried by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court who found him guilty of wounding with intent. Glen Gatland, defending, said Chip started using cannabis at the age of around 13 to cope with his brother’s death. Mr Gatland said Chip does not lead a 'pro-criminal lifestyle' and is capable of hard work. The court heard during the trial the men had lived in next-door flats at in Sunderland, last September 7, and had a shared kitchen. Shortly before midnight, Mr Brown realised something was burning in the oven and went to sort it out. Mr Hodson said: 'The defendant came into the kitchen, he was drunk and agitated. He began to be aggressive and threatened Mr Brown. Mr Brown walked out of the kitchen. 'The defendant followed Mr Brown with a kitchen knife and made a threat he was going to ""stick this into you"". Mr Brown tried to calm the situation down. The defendant lunged with the knife at his head. 'He moved his head quick enough to avoid a head injury and the blade caught and cut right through his left ear. The defendant said ""I will take the rest of your ear off and I will stab you. Luckily, he didn’t.'","Steven Brown turned down gas when he realised something was burning .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Derek Curran is being investigated amid allegations he had a relationship with a student and fathered a love child with her. He has not been charged with any offence - and police say the probe is in early stages . A headteacher is being investigated over allegations he fathered a love child with a student, police confirmed. Derek Curran, 53, has been suspended from his current school - Castlebrae Community High in Edinburgh - amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, the police investigation is expected to focus on his time in charge at another school in the city, Forrester High, where he worked for six years. Mr Curran has not been charged with any offence and the pupil who made the complaint is understood not to have attended either school. The woman is thought to have told officers she fell pregnant during a relationship spanning several years - and alleged that a later paternity test showed Mr Curran was the father. Now in her 20s, it is thought she gave birth after her 18th birthday. The allegations against Mr Curran only came to light as a result of a separate police inquiry. A source, who did not want to be named, told the Edinburgh News: 'The student says she fell pregnant during their relationship, which lasted a number of years since she was at school, and she became pregnant. 'She’s had a paternity test and it confirmed Curran was the father.' A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed the force had launched an inquiry which was at an 'early stage' but was unable to comment further. He said: 'Police are aware of the suspension of the headteacher at Castlebrae High School and are currently carrying out an investigation.' The development - described as 'very rare' by a union source - has sparked shock among parents. Susan Heron, vice-chairwoman of Castlebrae High parent council, said: 'It’s an absolute mess. 'I think the department have took the right action by removing these people while the investigation is done. The probe will focus on the time Mr Curran was head of Forrester High in Edinburgh, pictured, it is thought. The student, believed to have given birth around her 18th birthday, is not thought to have been a pupil at the school . 'We had a meeting with the new headteacher and concluded that what’s important is that the school continues to run. 'Hopefully this mess that’s unfolding will be taken away from the school, because it’s really nothing to do with the actual school. Let’s get on and finish the school year.' Mr Curran joined Castlebrae Community High last summer to oversee the secondary and its feeder primary schools. He was given the job of turning around the school after council chiefs pulled back from controversial plans to close it amid poor exam results and failing rolls. Officials had recommended the school - which had some of the worst exam results, truancy and exclusion rates in Scotland - should close, with pupils moved to other secondaries. Mr Curran has been suspended from Castlebrae High School, where he currently works. He joined the school last year and is credited with improving the establishment substantially . But Mr Curran has been credited with leading a revival in the school’s fortunes, after introducing a range of measure to boost the once-failing institution. Mr Curran was not available for comment. Staff at Castlebrae High were told about the decision to suspend Mr Curran last Monday by the council’s head of schools, Andy Gray. Grace Vickers, previously head at St Thomas of Aquin’s High, has taken the reins at Castlebrae until the end of term. A city council spokesman added: 'We will continue to co-operate fully with the police inquiry.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . A great-grandfather who has just celebrated his 110th birthday claims to be the oldest man in Europe – and believes a drop of whisky, good food and a loving family is the key to living a long life. Nazar Singh, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, has lived through two world wars, the Titanic disaster, the Great Depression, the first moon landing and the invention of colour television. Despite being born in Punjab, India in 1904, Mr Singh has lived in England for the last 50 years and in his Sunderland home for the last 15 years. Nazar Singh, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, has lived through two world wars, the Titanic disaster, the Great Depression, the first moon landing and the invention of colour television . Mr Singh, who was born in Punjab, India in 1904, doesn't have a birth certificate but does own a passport proving his age of 110 years old . The centenarian, who has nine children, 34 grandchildren and 63 great grandchildren, now claims to be the oldest living person in Europe. He said: ‘I feel very good and very happy. I still feel fit and strong. ‘I pray to the lord to take me when he wants to. ‘I have got a good family behind me and that is why I have got that far. I wouldn’t have lasted this long if they hadn’t looked after me. ‘The secret to my long life is a good family, good food and happiness. ‘Eat healthy food and look after each other. Family need to look after their elders.’ Mr Singh, who celebrated his most recent birthday on Sunday, was sent a letter from the Queen on his 100th birthday and now receives one every year. Mr Singh, with his late wife Narajan at the Taj Mahal, now lives with his son in Sunderland . Mr Singh and his late wife Narajan, who died 11 years ago, aged 90, from a heart attack . It is understood there are currently only two men in the world who are older than Mr Singh - Sakari Momoi and Yasutaro Koide, who are both Japanese and 111-years-old. Being born into a farming family, Mr Singh grew up with a love of the outdoors and was a keen gardener right up until the age of 107. He has never had an operation, has some of his original teeth and has no problems with his hearing. He likes drinking milk and almond oil, regularly eats fruit including grapes, bananas, plums, apples and kiwi and has a drop of whisky every night. He also sleeps for ten hours every night. After his wife Narajan Kaur, who he married in 1932, died 11 years ago, he moved in with son Chain Singh in a large semi-detached property. His son, who has four children and nine grandchildren, said: ‘My father is really happy, he doesn’t worry about anything. ‘Now we are caring for him like he cared for us when we were younger. ‘We hope he has many more happy years to come.’ Mr Singh celebrating his 100th birthday with his children (pictured left to right) Mohan, Harbans, Karter, Swarn and Chain . Mr Singh, pictured with his late wife Narajan, has never had an operation, eats plenty of fruit and vegetables and has a drop of whisky before bed every night . Mr Singh was raised in a small village in India and from the age of 10 helped his family to grow sugar cane, cotton, corn, wheat and later chilli, peanuts, potatoes and rice. He had two sisters and four brothers who have all since passed away. He met his wife Narajan, who lived in the neighbouring village, in 1932 and they became husband and wife in an arranged marriage. At the age of 30, Mr Singh and his younger brother Naranjan, travelled to a different part of India - Quata in Sindh, which is now part of Pakistan - to find work. They spent a year building bunkers for the army in the Second World War before travelling back to their home village to work on the farm. Mr Singh has six sons and three daughters: Reshem, now 77, Bachen, now 75, Karter, now 70, Sohan, now 66, Chain, now 61, Mohan, now 60, Piara, now 55, Swarn, now 53 and Harbans, now 50. They remained at the family farm in India until Mr Singh travelled to England in 1965 to join his eldest daughter who was living in Walsall in the West Midlands. He started working as a labourer and bought a house in Croft Street, Walsall in 1969, just before his wife and three sons joined him in England. He was promoted to the position of moulder and remained in that job until he retired and moved to Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, in 1989. Mr Singh has lived through two world wars and was just a child during the First World War (pictured) Nazar Singh has lived through some of the biggest historical events and disasters ever. He has lived through both world wars – as a child during the First World War between 1914 and 1918 and as a man in his late thirties for the Second World War between 1939 and 1945. He has also lived through other major events in history including the Russian Revolution (1917), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918), the Spanish Civil War (1936), the Pearl Harbour bombings (1941),  the start of the Korean War (1950) and the Great Depression. He was also alive for the Titanic disaster (1912), when man first landed on the moon (1969) and for the US 9/11 terrorist attacks (2001) and the 7/7 London bombings (2005). He has lived through the introduction of number plates (in 1904), colour television (which came into full effect in the United Kingdom in 1967), and the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming (1928). When he was born, Edward VII was on the throne and during his lifetime he has since seen four different monarchs succeed the throne including George V, Edward VIII, George VI and the current Queen Elizabeth II.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Proud Melbourne mum Hiranthi Wijesinha is still pinching herself after specialists successfully performed a rare life-saving operation on her unborn twins Polly and Lucy in the womb. The need for surgery arose during Ms Wijesinha's pregnancy because her girls were sharing the same placenta. The Melbourne Royal Women's Hospital Dr Stephen Cole and a team of specialists from two other Victorian hospitals from the Victorian Fetal Therapy Service worked together on the operation. Hiranthi Wijesinha is feeling grateful after specialists successfully performed a rare life-saving operation on her unborn twins Polly and Lucy in the womb. She is pictured at Melbourne Royal Women's Hospital nursing daughter Polly, while Lucy remains in an isolette . 'Essentially blood can flow freely between the babies and that can cause problems,' Dr Cole told MailOnline of twins sharing a placenta. This can affect how much blood the babies can get and also means what happens to one baby can affect the other. In Ms Wijesinha's case, Polly had a larger share of the blood supply, which meant Lucy was at risk of not surviving in the womb. 'Had Lucy passed away, because of the blood flow, it could have impacted on Polly, who would have been at risk of passing away,' Dr Cole said. 'It would have been a disaster.' As part of the surgery, doctors inserted a telescope into Ms Wijesinha's abdomen and into her uterus. On average just two of these life-saving operations are performed in Victorian hospitals each year . 'Through the telescope, we could look and see blood vessels that connected the two babies through the placenta. We passed a laser fibre through the telescope to seal off the connecting vessels,' Dr Cole said. 'This ends uneven sharing of blood between the babies.' The operation also meant that if Lucy had still died in the womb, Polly would not be affected. 'That was the aim,' Dr Cole said. While the surgery is not unheard of, Dr Cole said there were only up to two a year completed in Victoria each year. 'It worked well and what we hoped to achieve, although we did not necessarily expect it, it was what we were working towards,' Dr Cole said. The surgery also enabled the pregnancy to progress longer, which benefited the development of the babies, but due to Ms Wijesinha's pre-eclampsia, doctors endued a premature pregnancy on May 6. Dr Stephen Cole and a team of specialists from two other Victorian hospitals worked together on the operation . Ms Wijesinha, 42, said she had serious doubts that Lucy would survive the pregnancy. 'Right until the night before they were born, we were talking to palliative care about Lucy and we didn't expect her to be here today,' she said. 'We talked about resuscitation if she wasn't breathing.' 'It was definitely a relief,' she said of both girls being born alive and healthy. Polly was born weighing 1.4 kilograms and is now 2.3 kilograms, while Lucy was just 568 grams at birth. But Ms Wijesinha said with both girls born premature, they had done exceptionally well. 'Lucy is pretty much doing really really well. She had a stomach infection but she's over that now,' she said. 'She's now nearly a kilo and that was a few days ago so I'm hoping she hits a kilo next week. From the picture we took when they were two days old, til now is completely different.' The Melbourne Royal Women's Hospital where Ms Wijesinha's life-saving pregnancy operation was performed . Ms Wijesinha said she also had to opportunity to see Dr Cole after the girls were born. 'He came in the day the day after they were born to see me in the room and he was very surprised that little Lucy was still going and quite well,' she said. 'I was really quite grateful he took time out to see how I was and how the girls were.' Despite being discharged four days after the birth, Ms Wijesinha has returned to hospital everyday since to be with her girls. 'Polly is very close to coming home, potentially Monday. They were born at 31 weeks, so she'll only be 37 weeks when she goes home so its surprising everyone,' she said. 'She's started feeding occasionally when she was 34 - 35 weeks.' But she said although Lucy was doing well and progressing, she was expected to be in hospital longer. 'It will be a little while yet before she gets to feed the way Polly is... and it will still be a while before she comes,' she said. 'It's still too early to discuss because she's in the isolette'.","Rare life-saving operation performed on Australian twins in the womb .

"By . Dan Bloom . and Lizzie Edmonds . A pilot and his wife died when a light aircraft ‘dropped out of the sky’ and crashed into a field just yards from the busy M1 yesterday. Drivers watched in horror as the plane narrowly avoided hitting the M1 in Nottinghamshire, between junctions 26 and 27, at around 1.30pm today. Police, firefighters, paramedics, an air ambulance and a specialist rescue unit were called to the scene just off the southbound carriageway and the motorway was closed for around an hour. It is understood that the married couple who were killed lived locally. A light areoplane with two people on board crashed near to the M1 in Nottinghamshire at 1.30pm today . A shocked driver told how the pilot of the small red and white plane appeared to steer his plummeting aircraft out of the way of the motorway in Nottinghamshire as it came down then burst into flames. Craig Wing, 31, from Clifton, Nottinghamshire, said he was approaching junction 27 when he noticed the aircraft was in trouble. Mr Wing turned off at the next junction, got out of his car and ran back to help. He added: 'It lost control and it just dipped straight down. He (the pilot) managed to swerve from the M1 and into the field. 'It wasn't nice, my kids were very upset, saying Dad we've got to go and help these people. 'It . nosedived, the pilot managed to get the aircraft off the M1 into the . field on the right hand side. It wasn't a very nice view. 'I . ran through the fields to the aircraft. It went down very close to the . motorway, I would say half the size of a football field away. 'I rang the police straight away and pulled over. Two other gentlemen were also on their way over to help. Emergency services rushed to the scene near junction 26 of the busy motorway. Nottinghamshire police confirmed there were two casualties in the crash - but the extent of their injuries is unknown . 'The police, the ambulance and the fire crew were all first-class, amazing response.' Pilots wrote online that they believed the plane was a 42-year-old Cessna owned by the Merlin Flying Club, which operates out of Hucknall Airfield. The small airfield is less than a mile from the M1 between junctions 26 and 27, near the crash site. A representative of the airfield declined to comment on the crash and told MailOnline all enquiries should be directed to Rolls-Royce, which owns the airfield. Rolls-Royce did not immediately return requests for comment. An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman declined to give any details as to the seriousness of the victims' injuries, saying: 'I'm acting under police instructions.' Nottinghamshire police confirmed last night two people on the plane had died. A police spokesman said: 'Two men have died after a plane in which they were travelling came down in a field near the M1 at around 1.30pm today. 'There are only believed to have been two people in the plane when it came down clear of the motorway near Junction 26.'

"By . Jason Groves . 'Damaging': Jean-Claude Juncker, whose candidacy for president of the European Commission is being strongly challenged by David Cameron . David Cameron today warns Angela Merkel her controversial candidate to head the European Commission would be ‘deeply damaging’. In a hard-hitting article placed in leading European newspapers, the Prime  Minister makes public for the first time his opposition to arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker. The German Chancellor has openly backed Mr Juncker, who is the candidate of her party’s group in the European Parliament. But Mr Cameron says he has no legitimacy – and warns that his selection would be a slap in the face for millions who voted for Eurosceptic parties in last month’s European elections. He describes Mr Juncker’s claim to have a democratic mandate as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘Nowhere was Mr Juncker on the ballot paper. ‘Even in Germany. . . only 15 per cent of voters even knew he was a candidate.’ Mr Cameron says Europe ‘must either change or accept further decline’, and needs ‘bold leadership – people ready to heed voters’ concerns’ rather than a federalist who wants greater integration. The high-profile intervention suggests Mr Cameron’s bid to persuade Berlin to drop its support for Mr Juncker has reached an impasse. It came as Downing Street indicated he is ready to use the Parliament Act to pass legislation requiring an in/out referendum on Europe by 2017. This would allow him to force changes through against the wishes of the House of Lords. The legislation, which ran out of time in the Lords this year, is to be reintroduced by former Tory minister Bob Neill. But with both Labour and Liberal Democrats opposed, it still faces major hurdles. Labour last night said it ‘does not support’ the legislation. However, using the Parliament Act means Labour MPs will have to actively vote it down, rather than abstaining, in order to stop it becoming law. Mr Cameron outside No 10 with Mrs Merkel, who has backed Mr Juncker as a candidate for Europe's top job . Today, Mr Cameron argues EU leaders, not the European Parliament, should choose the next Commission president. He accuses the Parliament of a ‘power grab’, adding: ‘To accept such a claim would be deeply damaging for Europe and would undermine, rather than strengthen, the EU’s democratic legitimacy.’ The European Parliament yesterday stepped up pressure on EU leaders to accept Mr Juncker. Socialists and the centre-Right EPP group, which includes Mrs Merkel’s party, said they would form a grand coalition to support the former Luxembourg prime minister. The Prime Minister’s article appeared in a range of papers, such as Suddeutsche Zeitung in Germany and the Irish Times. Downing Street officials were also trying to place it in half a dozen papers across Europe, including in Austria, France and Belgium.","PM makes warning in article placed in leading European papers today .

"By . Simon Walters . Tracey Crouch burst into tears after her DJ lover dumped her by text while she was taking part in a vital Commons vote on the Queen's Speech . A Tory MP burst into tears after her DJ lover dumped her by text while she was taking part in a vital Commons vote. Tracey Crouch discovered in the middle of the Commons vote on the Queen’s Speech last week that her boyfriend, BBC radio’s Steve Ladner, was planning to move out of their Kent home. Only 24 hours earlier the pair had an emotional reunion after Miss Crouch returned from raising money for injured British soldiers on a charity walk in South America. The couple were seen kissing, drinking beer and mingling with other MPs on the Commons terrace, and they later spent the night together in London. But the following day, Mr Ladner texted 38-year-old Miss Crouch to say he was moving out of the home they shared in her Chatham  and Aylesford constituency – and returning to his wife Helen. His text message is believed to have said: ‘I’m sorry Tracey but I can’t do this. I want to go home. I can’t face speaking to you about it. When you get back I will have packed my bags and left.’ An MP who saw Miss Crouch in the voting lobby after she had received the message said: ‘Tracey was sobbing and she showed me the text message. She was in a state of shock, crying her eyes out. She ran out looking very distressed.’ Miss Crouch told a friend: ‘I am totally devastated. I cannot believe Steve has done this to me. ‘He told me he wanted to marry me and I believed him. I was so excited to get back from South America. He told me he still loved me – then he does this. He is a rat.’ Mr Ladner, 42, works for BBC Radio Kent where he hosts the  ‘Ladner’s Lunchbox’ show. He is also a Dover lifeboatman. Miss Crouch was on David Cameron’s A-list of women MPs, and is among those tipped for promotion in the forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle. She is a qualified football coach, runs a girls’ team, plays for the Commons football XI and was a member of a task force set up by ministers to encourage more women to take up sport. BBC radio presenter Steve Ladner told Miss Crouch by text that he was planning to move out of their Kent home . Miss Crouch has also won praise for campaigning against bullying in schools. The couple met two years ago at the radio station’s studios in Chatham. They had their first date at the 50th anniversary of the launch of the submarine HMS Ocelot which is now a tourist attraction in dry dock at the former naval dockyard. Mr Ladner is a Lib Dem supporter, and in the past Miss Crouch had joked that the couple were ‘proof a coalition can work’. He moved into Miss Crouch’s  constituency home in February.  Her three-week trip to Ecuador  with fellow MPs and injured servicemen included a charity climb up the 19,347ft-high Cotopaxi volcano which raised nearly £5,000 for  the Royal British Legion and Help For Heroes. But the MP’s trip was not without its problems. On her very first day in the capital city Quito, Miss Couch was relieved of her purse by a  local thief. Both Miss Crouch and Mr Ladner have declined to comment.","Tracey Crouch burst into tears after being dumped during Commons vote .

"By . Glen Owen . Speaker John Bercow has clashed with Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers after barring Sinn Fein MPs from a party at the Commons to mark a century of Irish Home Rule. He agreed to host a reception in his grace-and-favour Commons apartment next month to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Home Rule Act, which paved the way for Ireland’s independence from the UK. But Mr Bercow later changed his mind after he realised that five Sinn Fein MPs – who refuse to take up their seats at Westminster because of their Republican beliefs – were included on the guest list. Refusnik: John Bercow is refusing to host Sinn Fein MPs at a party at his home . The Speaker erupted with fury, saying there was ‘no way’ he would admit the MPs, who are close colleagues of Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, given that they had failed ‘to respect the traditions of the Commons’. His stance led to a row with both the Irish government and Miss Villiers, who urged Mr Bercow to reconsider for the sake of the fragile peace process. Theresa Villiers urged Mr Bercow to reconsider for the sake of the fragile peace process . Despite ‘intense lobbying’ by both the Irish ambassador Daniel Mulhall and Miss Villiers, the Speaker refused to change his mind. In protest, organisers have moved the event to the Irish Embassy in London, where guests on July 1 will include Baroness Williams of Crosby. The Sinn Fein MPs – Pat Doherty, Michelle Gildernew, Paul Maskey, Conor Murphy and Francie Molloy – do not attend the Commons and are not paid MPs’ salaries, although they do claim the costs of running offices. One MP who is close to Mr Bercow said: ‘John was happy to hold the event as he has affection for the Irish people, but given their disrespectful stance there was no way the Sinn Fein MPs were going to be allowed to come. He said, “No way”. ‘The Irish Embassy was very pushy about it, demanding the event be held in Speaker’s House. And then Theresa Villiers waded in, saying it was important to maintain civil relations with both Dublin and Sinn Fein for the sake of the peace process. But John wasn’t having any of it.’ Last night, a Commons spokesman said: ‘Mr Bercow felt that since the Sinn Fein MPs do not respect the traditions of the Commons, it would not have been appropriate to allow them into Speaker’s House. ‘Previous Speakers have also held  the same view.’ A spokesman for Miss Villiers was not available for comment.","Party to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Home Rule Act .

"By . Sally Lee . The debate to legalise medicinal cannabis in Australia has been reignited by one of the country's largest nursing unions, after taking a potentially controversial step which supports the use and possession of medical cannabis. The NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association, which has 59,000 members, said the drug could benefit patients suffering from chronic pain. Its 23-member executive committee has adopted a resolution backing recommendations from a bipartisan NSW parliamentary committee, which in 2013 suggested AIDS and terminally-ill patients be allowed to possess and use up to 15g of dry cannabis. One of Australia's largest nursing unions has taken the significant and potentially controversial step of supporting the use and possession of medical cannabis . The recommendation was knocked back by the then Barry O'Farrell-led NSW government. But the issue has since come back on to the state political agenda and Premier Mike Baird is said to be 'sympathetic' about people who use cannabis for medicinal purposes. The premier is against recreational cannabis use but his advisers have repeatedly refused to answer further questions about his stance on the drug, including whether or not he has ever tried it. NSWNMA general secretary Brett Holmes said on Sunday: 'Our members recognise the importance of exploring improved options for effective pain management, particularly for those patients who suffer from constant chronic pain.' NSWNMA's general secretary Brett Holmes said union members 'recognise the importance of exploring improved options for effective pain management, particularly for those patients who suffer from constant chronic pain' The union pointed to the fact that medical cannabis is already used in other parts of the world by patients suffering from 'nausea, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn's Disease and other chronic pain or post-traumatic stress disorders'. The NSWNMA has also signed a petition started by retired Tamworth nurse Lucy Haslam, whose 24-year-old son Daniel has terminal bowel cancer and uses cannabis to help with the side effects of chemotherapy. The Haslam family's online petition has attracted more than 50,000 signatures and calls for the decriminalisation of cannabis for people with terminal cancer. 'We can see the changes in him and fully believe that cannabis is absolutely the right path for him to go down as conventional treatments have failed him,' Ms Haslam said of her son. The nursing union's announcement comes just days after NSW Nationals MP Kevin Anderson revealed plans to introduce legislation that could legalise cannabis for terminally-ill patients. Mr Anderson met Mr Baird in late May to discuss the plan, a key departure from NSW Coalition policy. 'The premier was sympathetic and listened intently while I explained the issue to him and the circumstances surrounding my decision to try and change the laws,' the Nationals MP said after the meeting. Mr Baird said after the meeting that his government would give 'careful consideration' to Mr Anderson's bill. He added: 'I support the efforts of any Liberals and Nationals member who wishes to prepare a bill for consideration by the government. 'We will give careful consideration to Mr Anderson's bill, and I have nothing but sympathy for the Haslam family as they struggle with their son's illness.'","The NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association said in 2013 AIDS and terminally-ill patients be allowed to use up to 15g of dry cannabis .

He had been in Afghanistan for just two months . Helton was an explosives disposal technician based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He had been in the Army since 2010 . The Taliban claimed responsibility for Monday's ambush in Zabul. A . Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place between . foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district, and a 'huge number' of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims. Pentagon reports say the troops were all . special operations, though Toppen's Facebook page says he is in the . regular U.S. Army infantry. Fox News . reported that the aircraft in question is a B-1 Lancer, a strategic . Cold War-era bomber that can carry a payload of up to 125,000 pounds of . explosives. 'Five American . troops were killed yesterday during a security operation in southern . Afghanistan. Investigators are looking into the likelihood that friendly . fire was the cause. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of . these fallen,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. 'The casualties occurred during a security operation when their unit came into contact with enemy forces. Tragically, there is the possibility that fratricide may have been involved. The incident is under investigation,' the coalition said in an earlier announcement. One of the worst such incidents came in April 2002 when four Canadian soldiers were killed by an American F-16 jet fighter which dropped a bomb on a group of troops during night firing exercise in southern Kandahar. A senior police official in southern Zabul said the coalition soldiers were killed when they called for close air support. The deadly airstrike happened in southern Zabul Province as American troops were leading security missions in the run-up to the Afghan elections . Provincial police chief Gen. Ghulam Sakhi Rooghlawanay said there was a joint operation by Afghan and NATO troops in the area's Arghandab district early Monday. After that operation was over, the troops came under attack from the Taliban and called in air support, he said. 'After the operation was over on the way back, the joint forces came under the attack of insurgents, and then foreign forces called for air support. Unfortunately five NATO soldiers and one Afghan army officer were killed mistakenly by NATO air strike,' Rooghlawanay said. There was no way to independently confirm Rooghlawanay's comments. The coalition would not comment and NATO headquarters in Brussels also declined to comment. The only U.S. troops now involved in combat operations are usually Special Operations Forces that mentor their Afghan counterparts. They often come under fire and are responsible for calling in air support when needed. Because of constraints placed by outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai, such airstrikes are usually called 'in extremis,' or when troops fear they are about to be killed. Karzai blamed a similar airstrike called in by special forces mentoring an Afghan operation for killing a dozen civilians during an operation in northern Parwan province. The U.S. military vehemently denied the charge, saying that two civilians were killed in crossfire with Taliban militants and that airstrike was called in when forces thought they were about to be killed by insurgents. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack against the joint force in Zabul. Deadly airstrike: A U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancer bomber (like the one pictured) reportedly dropped the bombs that killed the U.S. troops Monday night . A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place on Monday night between foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district. Ahmadi claimed a 'huge number' of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims. Separately, a NATO statement said a service member died Monday as a result of a non-battle injury in eastern Afghanistan. The deaths bring to 36 the number of NATO soldiers killed so far this year in Afghanistan, with eight service members killed in June. The insurgents have intensified attacks on Afghan and foreign forces ahead of the country's presidential election runoff Saturday. Officials are concerned there could be more violence around the time of the vote, although the first round in April passed relatively peacefully. Casualties have been falling in the U.S.-led military coalition as its forces pull back to allow the Afghan army and police to fight the Taliban insurgency. All combat troops are scheduled to be withdrawn from the country by the end of this year.","Five soldiers died in southern Afghanistan as special operations soldiers were on patrol with Afghan National Army troops on June 9 .

He said there was nothing he could do to help the woman, who was on her way to work, as the tide was running too fast. 'She was panicking a fair bit, tooting her horn and crying out for help,' he said. A tour guide - believed to be named Neville - rescued her to safety whilst on board a Guluyambi Cultural Cruise vessel, reported NT News. Footage showed Fiona climbing out of the window of car as Neville helped her onto the boat. Other tourists on board quickly came to her aid.

Earlier this month 62-year-old Bill Scott was killed by a crocodile in the same region, about 80 kilometres away. Mr Scott was on board a boat outside crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers when the unusual attack happened, sources said. Grandfather-of-four Bill Scott, 62, was snatched by a 4.7m long saltwater crocodile earlier this month . A statement was released by his family which confirmed that the grandfather-of-four was 'standing at the rear of his moored boat' when he was attacked and dragged into the water by a 4.7 metre long saltwater crocodile in the mid-afternoon on June 7. Mr Scott's remains were found inside one of two crocodiles shot dead by officers in South Alligator River on the following day in the Arnhem Land region of the Northern Territory. Authorities were stunned to hear that he had been grabbed by the crocodile while on board a boat - a situation that is usually considered safe. However, tourists are warned to beware of crocodiles in any part of Kakadu as an attack is always possible. Kakadu National Park is World Heritage-listed and is where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was shot.","The young woman, only known as Fiona, was rescued by Neville who leading a boat tour at the time .

"By . John Hall . This is the world's oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant - which still retains a classic 1950s feel, as well as the fast food chain's original mascot 'Speedee'. Built in 1953, the restaurant in Downey, California still has its original red-striped exterior, giving it an appearance quite different from the other 30,000 McDonald's restaurants around the world. The unique, time-capsule appearance of the restaurant is completed by the 1950s-style uniforms the staff wear, and the original recipe hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and milkshakes. Scroll down for video . Retro: The McDonald's restaurant in Downey, California still has its original red-striped exterior, giving it an appearance quite different from the other 30,000 branches around the world . Character: A key part of the nostalgic feel of the restaurant is the presence of the original McDonald's mascot - Speedee the chef - suspended 60ft above the car park . Time-capsule: Staff at the restaurant wear 1950s-style uniforms - including paper hats - while serving original recipe hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and milkshakes . Key to the nostalgic nature of the restaurant is the presence of the original McDonald's mascot - Speedee the chef - suspended 60ft above the car park. While serving original 1950s cuisine - which customers order from a retro-designed menu - staff at the outlet wear the fast food chain's historic uniforms, including paper hats. As . well as old-fashioned food, the restaurant also serves current . favourites such as Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets - but only because it . nearly closed in the 1990s due to declining sales. McDonald's . had planned to demolish it and build a 'retro' one nearby but instead . restored the current architecture following pressure from . preservationists. The restaurant has been located in Downey - 12 miles from Los Angeles - for the past 61 years. Despite its history, many locals had no idea the restaurant was the oldest of its kind in existence. Customer Christians Gerhard, 40, from Las Vegas, Nevada, made a 560-mile round trip to Downey just to eat at the restaurant. Traditional: The mascot 'Speedee' was based on a chef who embodied the fast service diners could expect and he still features on the Downey restaurant's drinks . Different times: Speedee looks over the building's so-called 'Googie' architecture - a popular movement between the 1940s and mid-1960s inspired by the USA's growing obsession with cars and space travel . Unique: Even the two 'golden arches' either side of the restaurant's front service window are also a relic because they are of a kind only installed at the world's first three McDonald's . 'It's my favourite McDonald's by far. That's why I made the effort to come here,' he said. 'There's . something special about it, the architecture and the feel. It's more . like a 1950s burger shack than a modern fast food place,' she added. Her husband, Kirby, 45 agreed, adding: 'You can almost imagine waitresses on roller skates bringing the meals.' 'I love McDonald's but most of them you visit could be anywhere... This . is so distinctive, from the look of it, and you'd never believe it was a . McDonald's if it wasn't for the Golden Arches,' he said. When built, the restaurant was only the third ever McDonald's to open and operated outside of the main franchise for decades. The first ever McDonald's opened in San Bernardino, California in 1938, selling hamburgers for just ten cents each. But . as it was run independently from the main company, the site in Downey . kept its distinctive 1950s feel, while other McDonald's restaurants . worldwide were given a more uniform look. Record: The restaurant has been located in Downey - 12 miles from Los Angeles - for the past 61 years. Despite its history, many locals had no idea the restaurant was the oldest of its kind in existence . Branching out: As well as old-fashioned food, the restaurant also serves current favourites such as Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets - but only because it nearly closed in the 1990s due to declining sales . Rescue: McDonald's had planned to demolish the restaurant and build a brand new branch with a 'retro' design nearby. Instead they opted to restore the current architecture following pressure from preservationists . The mascot 'Speedee' was based on a chef who embodied the fast service diners could expect and he still features on the Downey restaurant's drinks. The fast food chain replaced the character with the now far better known Ronald McDonald in 1967. Speedee looks over the building's so-called 'Googie' architecture - a popular movement between the 1940s and mid-1960s that was inspired by the USA's growing obsession with cars and space travel. Even the two 'golden arches' either side of the restaurant's front service window are also a relic because they are of a kind only installed at the world's first three McDonald's. Visitors come from all over the world purely to experience the unique McDonald's restaurant. Among them is Simon Gray, a 38-year-old building developer from Nottingham. 'I love McDonald's and I'd read about this location on the internet and just had to visit - it was a sort of pilgrimage for me,' he said. 'I've eaten at McDonald's all over the world but this one is so unique... I don't know whether it's the retro style but the food tastes even better than it normally does,' he added. Brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald opened the first McDonald's restaurant in San Bernardino, California in 1940. Eight years after it was set up, the company introduced a 'Speedee Service System', which helped kick-start the fast food craze by pre-cooking food ahead of a customer order. To help sell the idea, McDonald's created the mascot 'Speedee' - designed as a chef to reassure customers of the food's quality. Ronald McDonald (centre) replaced Speedee as the company's official mascot in 1967. He inhabits a fantasy world of characters, including the monster Grimace (top left) and The Hamburgler (bottom left) The first restaurants were run as franchises, allowing each to operate independently while benefiting from being part of a bigger brand. It wasn't until 1955 that Czech-American businessman Ray Kroc opened the ninth McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois. The success of his business encouraged Kroc to partner with the McDonald brothers and relaunch the business as a global chain. Aggressive expansion followed, with the McDonald brothers regularly arguing with Kroc over how the business should be run. By 1961 the brothers finally grew tired of Kroc's global ambitions for the company, selling their shares to him for $2.7million and retiring from the fast food business altogether. In 1967 Speedee was replaced as company mascot by Ronald McDonald - a clown who inhabits the 'McDonaldland' fantasy world. The origin of Ronald McDonald is disputed, with actor Willard Scott claiming McDonald's adopted a character he had invented, while the company insists Scott merely played the role in early television appearances.","Restaurant in Downey, California was only the third McDonald's ever built .

"By . Wills Robinson . The family of an accounts manager who died when a branch fell on her during a three-year-old's birthday party have called on more research to stop people dying in similar circumstances . Erena Wilson from Hanwell, west London, was strolling through the picturesque Kew Gardens, Richmond, south west London, in September 2012 when she was hit by part of a Cedar of Lebanon tree. After the inquest into the 31-year-old's tragic death, her parents Chris Wilson and Elizabeth Shelley paid tribute to their 'darling daughter' but called for more time to be spent analysing the risks of Summer Branch Drop to save lives in the future. However, after the verdict of accidental death was recorded at West London Coroner's Court, staff at the gardens refuted the claim, insisting her death was a 'terrible freak accident'. Action needed: The family of Erna Wilson, 31, have demanded 'urgent research' into the risks associated with Summer Branch Drop after she was hit by a falling branch at Kew Gardens in Richmond (right) Outside the court, Pauline Giroux read out a statement on behalf of Ms Wilson's parents. In it they said: 'First, we would like to thank the jury for the time and consideration they have given to their considerations. 'Second, the loss of our darling daughter, Erena, shattered us as a family. Our memories of her are particularly vivid today, as the circumstances surrounding her death are brought to the fore. 'Our thoughts are not only with Erena but our hearts go out to all the families that have lost loved ones in similar circumstances.' She was at Kew Gardens to celebrate the birthday of her friend Tess Marshall’s daughter Ruby, and an inquest heard it was pure 'fluke' that they too were not killed in the tragedy. They have faced questions over the safety of its trees and whether it could have prevented the tragedy. Richard Barley, director of horticulture, insisted that everything possible is done to ensure the safety of visitors to the gardens. Speaking after the inquest, he said: 'The jury has found that there was no identifiable cause of branch failure from this tree that caused this tragic accident. Memories: The parents of the accounts manager from New Zealand said their daughter's death had 'shattered' the family . 'We of course continue to extend our greatest sympathies of the family and friends of Ms Wilson.' He dismissed calls for fencing to be put in place warning against summer branch drop, saying it would be 'inappropriate to place warning signs because it is such an unlikely thing to happen and it is so unforeseeable.' John McLinden QC, representing Ms Wilson’s family, said it had been raining heavily in the hours leading up to the accident on September 23. Tree branches are vulnerable to dropping off suddenly when they endure long dry spells followed by heavy rain in a condition known as 'Summer Branch Drop'. Mr McLinden said Kew Gardens failed to put up signs warning of the danger because it deemed the risk so minimal, and questioned why it had not fenced trees off. But Patrick Blakesley, a lawyer representing Kew, said the death was a 'terrible freak accident'. After just 45 minutes of deliberation, the jury of four men and three women returned a verdict of accidental death. The foreman told the court the jury found 'there is insufficient evidence to establish the cause of the branch failure'. Defence: A lawyer representing Kew Gardens claimed her death was a 'terrible freak accident' Ms Wilson was walking along a path in when Ms Marshall suddenly noticed a large Cedar of Lebanon branch, 20ft (6m) long and 12in (31cm) thick, was crashing down from 66ft (20m) above. Ms Marshall screamed 'run' and fled for her life, but when she looked back she saw New Zealand-born Ms Wilson lying face-down on the ground surrounded by debris from the tree. Ms Marshall had earlier told the four-day inquest that she heard a 'crack like lightning' and saw the thick branch fall. She said: 'It blocked out the sky and all I could see was this umbrella of branches. 'As I was running I thought the whole tree was falling over. I was sure it was going to hit me. I was running away and then I heard a heavy thud. An ooomph.' Argument: Staff at the picturesque gardens refuted claims it was Summer Branch Drop because of heavy rain before the incident . She spun around to see her friend motionless with blood coming out of her mouth and ears. The branch fell with such force that it brought two others down in its wake and smashed Ms Wilson’s backpack, making 'sawdust' of the glass inside. Ms Marshall said her young daughter had run ahead to walk with her aunt just moments earlier - but was in floods of tears at the sight. She said: 'Because they had stopped and seen everything, my three year-old was really upset and crying so she went on with her auntie.' Paramedics rushed to the scene, but Ms Wilson was pronounced dead at 2.51pm - after 45 minutes of cardiac resuscitation. Experts at the Botanical Gardens, which is home to the world’s largest collection of living plants, said the tree had no sign of decay and was regularly inspected. Tony Kirkham, head of arboretum at Kew, blamed the branch fall on a heavy downpour - 0.2in (5mm) of rain had fallen in the hour before the accident - and strong winds. He said: 'I think the branch deluge was triggered by a wind squall. If we say that the wind gusted at 30mph, that would be strong enough to move branches.' He dismissed suggestions that summer branch drop caused the accident, pointing out that it had been the wettest summer since records began and it happened later in the year. He said Kew did all it could to care for the tree and that warning signs would have been an over-reaction. But Jeremy Barrell, a tree expert called by the family, branded Kew’s system of tree inspection 'a shambles' and said 'this is definitely a case of Summer Branch Drop'. He said the death could have been avoided if the tree, which was planted in 1730, had been pruned. Assistant Coroner Elizabeth Pygott said the death was a 'ghastly accident' but she would not be making a Prevention of Future Deaths report. Mr McLinden QC said Ms Wilson’s family wanted more to be done to raise awareness of the 'insidious danger' of summer branch drop. Trees tend to shed their branches during a heatwave because they struggle to absorb water into their roots. Even though the causes of Summer Branch Drop are not entirely clear, it is believed to be a common problem with trees that have longer limbs. There is often a warning sign before a branch comes down which is said to sound like a 'sharp crack not unlike the sound of a shotgun going off'. Paul Smith, who is a technical officer with the Arboricultural Association, told the website TreeSurgey.com: 'Certainly there’s a clear relationship between the weather conditions and the frequency of summer branch drop. 'It’s notoriously unpredictable so it’s very difficult from a tree owner’s point of view to meet their duty of care.' Many trees throughout the country will show signs of 'stress' during periods of high temperatures, with their leaves turning yellow and even falling off. While this might look like the tree is dying, it was a mechanism the tree uses to defend itself. Trees will shed leaves and sometimes branches so there is less surface area for water to be lost. A number of ways to combat tree branches dropping in heavily built up areas include watering them more often. However it is hard to distinguish how much water one tree needs and how often they should be watered. In 2011, a 13-year-old girl died in a Peterborough park after a branch fell on her head. Sophie Howard was with friends at a recreation ground in Yaxley while teachers at her school were on strike.","Erena Wilson, 31, from west London died during a three-year-old's birthday .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The grieving family of a music fan who was beaten to death in a random attack at a festival have made a heart-breaking appeal to find the man's killer. Robert Hart, 26, suffered fatal head injuries after being attacked in front of his girlfriend at the Parklife Weekender Festival in Manchester. It is believed Mr Hart was punched to the floor and knocked unconscious as he stepped in to protect Gemma Parry after she was hit in the back with an inflatable doll. Scroll down for video . Heartbreak: Elaine Hart, the mother of a music fan who died in a random attack at Parklife Festival in Manchester made an emotional plea for her son's killer to come forward today . Festival: Mr Hart, pictured with girlfriend Gemma, was waiting for Snoop Dogg to come on the main stage of the festival when he was punched to the ground and knocked unconscious . The attack took place as 67,000 people converged on Heaton Park to see R'n'B-turned reggae star Snoop Dogg aka Snoop Lion aka Snoopzilla perform live. Two off-duty medical staff rushed to Mr Hart's aid and gave him CPR. He was rushed to hospital but died four days later after suffering a bleed to the brain. Today his mother Elaine, 65, from Rainow, near Macclesfield, Cheshire, broke down as she made an appeal for the killer to come forward. Mrs Hart, who was supported by her family and Miss Parry, 32, said: 'I have lost my son who I absolutely adored, as I do all of my children. 'He would come home and hug me and as he got older he got taller and taller and made me feel small. I just looked forward to him coming home so much. 'He would sometimes call me Elaine or mum but quite often he would still say mummy. 'He was the kindest, warmest, and . funniest man and not aggressive and we all adored him. This person has . took that all away from us. They know they have done it.' Appeal: The music fan's family and his girlfriend Gemma, pictured centre, spoke at the appeal today. Mr Hart was attempting to protect Miss Parry, 32, when the attack took place . Comfort: Sisters Rachel North and Nicola Hart embrace following the emotional appeal. Mr Hart was taken to hospital following the attack - but died four days later from his injuries . Mrs Hart later read a Mother’s Day card the victim had written to her last March. He wrote: 'To mummy. Wishing you all the love in the world on Mother’s Day. 'Thanks for always being there and being an endless source of advice and love and for being a fantastic chef. Lots of love, Robert.' Keen guitarist and Manchester City fan Mr Hart, originally from Macclesfield, lived in Liverpool with his girlfriend after attending university in the city.

She said: 'He was the kindest, warmest, and funniest man and not aggressive and we all adored him' 'Adored': The victim's sister Nicola struggles to contain her emotions as her mother spoke to press today. Mrs Hart read from a mother's day card her son sent her last year which read: 'Thanks for always being there' The pair were said to be planning to start a family together. Mr Hart’s brother Richard said: 'A music festival is supposed to be about fun and laughter and memories to share. It’s not a place for any act of violence like this. Bobby was a brilliant brother and one cowardly act has took him away from all of our family and friends. 'Bobby would ring any member of my family whether it was raining or snowing and he would say ""what a brilliant day to be alive"". 'One person’s actions have changed that. Those words will now never be spoken. Investigation: Police have released this efit of a man wanted in connection with the violent attack . 'There was one word that every single one of us - friends and family - used: awesome. 'He was just awesome to be around and to spend time with. We have all been robbed of his life. Nothing will be the same. 'When you have to tell an 8-year-old boy who Bobby doted on - my son - that you can’t see him anymore it is one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. 'He was a people person. He has had a massive influence on everybody’s life. 'I will turn my son into him because that’s what Bobby would have pushed for.' Miss Parry said: 'He would always try to protect me. He was so looking forward to the festival and excited, he couldn’t wait.' The incident occurred on Saturday June 7 after Mr Hart travelled to Manchester for the festival - which was attended by a total of 120,000 people over the two days. He and his girlfriend were waiting for Snoop to come on stage at 9.15pm when the blow up doll was thrown into the crowd and it struck Gemma in the back. A barman said: 'The inflatable toy was full of mud and Robert turned with a bit of a scowl but he then put his hand up to say he did not want trouble. The other guy punched him once and he fell to the floor and I heard a thud. 'It was horrible. His girlfriend was screaming and people were waving for help. 'Some of the crowd helped him and gave him chest compressions and then security turned up. When they picked him up you could see he was all over the place and his eyes were not right. 'I just knew it was something serious but never thought it would be this bad.' Mr Hart was initially taken to a medical tent by security officers being being rushed to North Manchester General Hospital. Together: Mr Hart with Miss Parry. The couple, who met at University, was planning on starting a family . Music fan: Mr Hart at the festival. The shop assistant and keen guitar player lived in Liverpool with his girlfriend . His condition deteriorated and he was later transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford where he died on Wednesday June 11. DI Richard Eales of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Our immediate thoughts go out to Robert’s family and loved ones. We currently have specially trained officers with them to help through this terrible time. 'We believe a confrontation took place following an inflatable doll hitting Robert’s girlfriend. 'We are aware other assaults took place in the park that evening, but I am specifically appealing for witnesses who recall seeing the inflatable doll and the attack on Robert immediately thereafter. 'I am keen for those witnesses to come forward and other persons nearby who may have mobile phone footage of the attack or captured an image of the person responsible. Champions: Mr Hart, a Manchester City fan, poses proudly next to the Premier League trophy . 'Finally, if you are the man responsible or were with him that evening, please come forward.'

He was also wearing shorts and a blue, bomber-style jacket with the letter ‘A’ in white on the front. A spokesman for Parklife said: 'We pride ourselves on a history of Parklife Weekender without any incidents. 'We regret that an isolated incident has taken place at this year’s event. However, medics were on the scene within minutes of it taking place. We urge festival-goers to help the police identify the individual involved and contact them if they have any information at all.'","Robert Hart attacked at Parklife Music Festival in Manchester .

"By . Ryan Lipman . It's on the brink of extinction throughout Australia and while most people will never get the chance to see a tiger quoll in the wild, the rare animal has been captured on camera in bush in the Hunter region in NSW. As part of the Watagan survey, University of Wollongong researchers set up 90 sites with motion-activated cameras in isolated and urban areas in the Watagan area in the hope of getting a glimpse of Australia's biggest marsupial carnivore. Research team member Katarina Mikac told Daily Mail Australia as the anaimals are listed as endangered, there is a possibility the tiger quoll could become extinct within a decade. Nine endangered tiger quolls, including the one pictured, were captured by motion-activated cameras  in Watagan Mountains bushland over the summer months, lured by the smell of chicken wings . Using chicken wings as bait, nine tiger quolls were lured towards the cameras and captured in Watagan Mountains bush, south west of Newcaslte. 'The wings weren't accessible - the quolls pretty much come and smell the bait and have a look around and then leave,' Ms Mikac said. The cameras used by the researchers were similar to those use by police in the hunt for Australia's previously most wanted fugitive Malcolm Naden, while he was hiding in Barrington Tops bushland in 2012. In one of the images, a tiger quoll can be seen wandering the bush floor, with a native lyrebird in the background, while another climbs a stump. While the research has been hailed a success, tiger quolls are endangered and could become extinct with a decade. Pictured is a second tiger quoll captured by the cameras during the survey . The survey was conducted over the summer with an aim of establishing if and where quolls live in the Watagan area. 'We don't know much about the habitat and area so we're just doing a blanket survey at the moment,' Ms Mikac said. 'Historical records occur all up and down the eastern seaboard but some sightings are quite old. Since European settlement, their numbers have declined - we know roughly where they are, it's just a matter of updating sightings.' As the team was looking for an endangered species, Ms Mikac said she did not expect to see too many of the animals but that nine was a strong number. 'It was certainly a good sign of population,' she said. 'I would say the study is a success, I have colleagues working with endangered species who can go four years without seeing an animal.' Since European settlement, tiger quolls numbers have declined, but the animals can still be found primarily in NSW and stretching to Victoria and Queensland . Ms Mikac said she was confident the quolls captured by the cameras were all different and that the research method was appropriate for a first attempt. 'We set the traps quite a distance away from each other - about half a kilometre apart,' she said. All nine sightings occured in the bush areas, but the researcher said despite not seeing any in urban areas, the area of bush was popular with campers, bush walkers and dirt bike riders. The sightings will allow the researchers to monitor the numbers to better manage the populations. 'Now that we've don't this, we can do a much more targeted survey and research of the species in general,' she said. However, Ms Mikac said she could not make a conclusion at this stage on tiger quoll numbers or habitat preference in NSW. The Watagan Mountains, pictured, is surrounded by bush and national park land and is popular with campers and bush walkers . She said an unrelated nine-year survey from the Batemans Bay area to the Victorian boarder only found 19 of the animals, but added there could be many variables contributing to this number. With the Watagan research finished, the team is now shifting their next research area to the Illawarra area south of Sydney. She said there had been reported sightings in this area in recent years. NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service (WIRES) spokesperson Justin McKee said in the past year, two tiger quolls had come into the organisation's care. 'One in Parramatta and one in the Blue Mountains,' he said. 'It's an uncommon species to come into care. Two in a year is pretty normal - it's about as infrequent as we get them. To spot them is very rare. 'They have very large territories. They live in isolation and live solitary lives. Their existence in Sydney would be quite low.' Tigers quolls can also be found in Victoria and Queensland. In February a tiger quoll was filmed in the Grampians National Park in Victoria shortly after bushfires raged through a third of the park. The animals were thought to have been locally extinct as the species had not been seen in the Grampians area in more than 140 years, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The Watagan Mountains, where the tiger quolls were spotted, is south west of Newcaslte . Taronga Zoo senior catcher Wendy Gleen said the International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates there are about 20,000 tiger quolls left. But Ms Gleen said what the population numbers were doing was more important than the actual amount, and in the case of the tiger quoll, numbers were decreasing. She said the zoo has a pair of female tiger quolls and its focus is on education. 'We try and inspire people to take action,' she said. Ms Gleen said the people who live in areas where there are tiger quolls can help by connecting fragments of bush important to the animals' survival. 'Planting locally native plant species or joining bush regeneration groups,' she said and added this was particularly important because of the animals' massive home ranges of up to 500 hectares. On the back of the tiger quoll sightings, she said it was 'fantastic' that the animals were living relatively close to Sydney and that land owners in the Watagan area had a unique opportunity to help the animals. 'With land clearing for hobby farms and properties, there's scope for land owners to have an impact by retaining natural vegetation,' she said. Despite quolls sometimes getting into chicken coops, she added that people needed to remember the animals were a highly threatened species.","Rare tiger quolls spotted in Watagan Mountains in Hunter region .

"By . Lydia Warren . A quick-thinking Canadian woman has been diagnosed with a stroke after she filmed herself suffering the symptoms - after doctors previously insisted she was simply stressed. Stacey Yepes, 49, from Thornhill, Ontario, recognized her numbness and partial facial paralysis as signs of having a stroke, so she went to the ER - but doctors sent her away with advice on how to manage stress. 'They told me I needed . to learn how to manage my stress,' she told CNN. 'I just laughed to myself and thought, ""This is not stress"". I couldnt believe that was the diagnosis they came . up with.' Scroll down for videos . Quick thinking: Stacey Yepes grabbed her camera when her face became partially paralyzed and she suffered tingles over her body. Doctors had told her she was simply stressed but she thought it was a stroke . Struggle: The 49-year-old also showed how it was tough for her to use her left hand during the episode . But two days later, the numbness returned as she was driving - so she pulled over and grabbed her smartphone. 'The sensation is happening again,' she says in the video. 'It's all tingling on . left side.' She then tries to lift her left arm but says she finds it hard to point at specific things, like her nose. She also films herself following the advice of the doctors to breathe in and out slowly to manage her stress, but the symptoms persist. Relief: Yepes showed doctors the footage and they concluded she had suffered several mini strokes. She is taking time off work and taking medication to prevent any future strokes . The Heart and Stroke Foundation gives five warning signs of stroke: . Weakness: Sudden loss of strength, numbness in face, arm or leg, even if it's only temporary . Trouble speaking: Sudden difficulty talking or understanding spoken language, even if temporary . Vision problems: Sudden trouble with vision, even if temporary . Headache: Sudden severe or unusual headache . Dizziness: Sudden loss of balance, especially with any of the above signs. Doctors advise people to dial 911 at the first sign of a stroke. 'I think it was just to show somebody, . because I knew it was not stress-related,' she told CBC. 'And I thought if I could show somebody what was happening, they would . have a better understanding.' Afterwards, . she went to Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto - a different hospital from . her first visit - and was referred to Toronto Western Hospital's stroke . center. Doctors . there concluded that Yepes was having a transient ischemic attack or . TIA, which is also called a mini-stroke. She told CNN each one had . lasted between seven and 10 minutes. She had an MRI scan and the stroke team identified a small injury. They determined that her mini strokes were caused by a buildup of plaque in her arteries, and a blood clot then formed on the plaque, blocking an artery leading to her brain. Although she only suffered temporary mini strokes, they are a sign that a full-blown stroke could be around the corner. Support: She went to Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, pictured, and they sent her to see a specialist . 'In . all my years treating stroke patients, we’ve never seen anyone tape . themselves before,' Dr Cheryl Jaigobin, the stroke neurologist at . the hospital's Krembil Neuroscience Centre, told CBC. 'Her symptoms were . compelling, and the fact she stopped and found a way to portray them in . such a visual fashion, we were all touched by it.' Yepes, a legal secretary in Toronto, told CNN she was 'feeling good' and is now being monitored and taking medication. She has been off work but hopes to return in July.

"By . Sally Lee . A pub fight on State of Origin night led to an 18-year-old man being gunned down on a western Sydney street, police allege. Matthew James Perry, 21, is accused of fatally shooting Jed Coates in the neck on Wednesday night after they'd both spent the evening watching NSW wrap up the Origin series with separate groups of friends at the Colyton Hotel. Less than an hour after the full time siren, Coates was dead. Neighbours living in Nevada Avenue, Colyton, reported hearing an argument in the street not long before police and paramedics arrived about 11pm. They tried to revive the young man, who reportedly worked as a carpenter. Scroll down for video . Jed Coates, 18, was shot dead outside a Sydney pub on Wednesday night after watching State of Origin . Jed Coates as been remembered by his twin brother as a 'king', while friends paid tribute on Facebook: 'You were a good kid, you didn't deserve this' Police arrested Perry, a panel beater, at his home on the same street just after 3am. He was charged with murder and refused bail at Mount Druitt Local Court on Thursday morning. Court documents say Mr Coates encountered Perry, who went to the same high school as him, at the Colyton Hotel while drinking and watching the Origin match with a mate. They were kicked out of the pub after allegedly getting into a fight with Perry and his friends. When Perry took a taxi home shortly afterwards, Mr Coates and his friend were waiting for him at the end of his street with Mr Coates allegedly armed with a shovel. Jed Coates, 18, was shot in the street after confronting his alleged attacker with a shovel, following on from an altercation the pair had at the pub . According to the documents, Mr Coates yelled 'shoot me, shoot me', before Perry shot him with a rifle just below the right side of his neck. He then ran away after failing to find the cartridge in the dark. Homicide detectives lined Nevada Avenue with police tape and conducted an extensive search of one of its houses and a car parked outside. Mr Coates' best mate Dean White watched on with another friend on Thursday morning, the pair holding back tears as they hugged each other. Mr White said he'd decided to give the pub a miss and watch the game at home. He learned about what happened through phone calls from other friends. 'I didn't think it was real until we saw the news this morning,' he told AAP. State of Origin Blues fans celebrated their win over Queensland at ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Wednesday night .

"By . Wills Robinson . Scrounger: Kevin Stephenson, 53, stole the highest rate of disability benefits for four years while working as a lorry driver . A trucker milked nearly £24,000 in disability benefits by pretending to need a carer - despite spending 55 hours a week driving HGVs, a court heard. Kevin Stephenson, 53, from Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, stole taxpayers' money while working five days a week at a successful haulage firm, Alloa Sheriff Court was told. Over four years, he claimed the highest rate of Disability Living Allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions and said he needed a wheelchair. But in August 2012, he was working as a . HGV lorry driver with Clackmannanshire-based Gogar Logistics. Prosecutor Lindsey Brooks told the court how Stephenson claimed he 'needed assistance with functions on a daily basis'. However an investigation was launched after witnesses reported that he had been employed by a recruitment agency. The depute fiscal said: 'He arrived at work by car and walked 200 yards to the site. He was not off sick at any period of time. 'He used to drive vehicles delivering goods, containers, and timber.' Mrs Brooks said a witness from the company said that a substantial level of physical fitness was needed in order to carry out the job. The fiscal added: 'He still suffers from multiple sclerosis but has not had a relapse in four years. 'He may have been entitled to some benefits, but the exact amount cannot be calculated.' Stephenson pleaded guilty to obtaining £23,950 disability living allowance by fraud between June 2009 and June 2013. Robert Smith, defending, said: 'Mr Stephenson had a significant relapse when he made an application for disability allowance and up until 2009 he continued to have relapses. 'As far as Mr Stephenson is concerned, he will have Multiple Sclerosis for the rest of his life - he still suffers from the disease and will continue to do so. 'Even though he was suffering Multiple Sclerosis symptoms, he soldiered on.' He added that Stephenson accepted that for substantial periods of time he was not eligible for benefits. Mr Smith said he also suffers from depression, and currently lives alone. Convicted: Stephenson pleaded guilty to taking nearly £24,000 worth of disability benefits at Alloa Sheriff Court (right) and was given 225 hours of unpaid work . The court heard that deductions were already being made from his benefits. Stephenson was sentenced to 225 hours of unpaid work, and made subject to a restriction of liberty order for three months. Sheriff David Mackie told him he had committed an offence that often led to imprisonment. He said: 'I am not going to impose a custodial sentence. 'I accept that you have grave health issues and have taken into account that many of your health complications are caused by stress.'","Kevin Stephenson, 53, said he needed a wheelchair while driving a lorry .

It is understood The Reserve Bank of Australia will restore the burnt bills as it met the requirements of its policy on damaged and incomplete banknotes. The RBA's guidelines outlines that: 'If several pieces of the same banknote are presented, the RBA's policy is for each piece to be worth a share of the value in proportion to its size.' 'The combined value paid should be the face value of the original banknote.' If less than 20 percent of the banknote is missing the full face value is paid. However if between 20-80 percent of the note is missing value is paid in proportion with the percentage remaining. No payment is made if more than 80 percent of the note is missing. This comes after the man, western Sydney's Merrylands, made failed attempts to deposit the money at his local Westpac branch as the teller refused to accept it.

"By . Sally Lee . and Aap . An eight-year-old girl found dead at her home in Cairns, Queensland after being repeatedly hit with a vacuum cleaner pipe in November 2011 . A Queensland girl, who was bashed to death by her mother, became 'invisible' in the system as her one year absence from school went undetected until it was too late, a court heard on Friday. The eight-year-old was found dead at her Cairns home after being repeatedly hit with a vacuum cleaner pipe in November 2011. Her mother, who can't be named for legal reasons, is serving a seven-year sentence after last year pleading guilty to manslaughter. The girl's stepfather was receiving Centrelink payments while the child's school was told the family had moved overseas. He was sentenced to three years in jail on the same charge for ignoring the abuse. 'It was inconceivable that [the girl] was invisible to one part of society but her existence and whereabouts were known by another,' counsel assisting the Coroner, Stephanie Williams, said at a coronial inquest in Cairns. The girl's step-grandparents said they were aware the girl was being abused but never alerted authorities. The pair conceded they could have done more. The court heard the mother at times made the girl wear a wig, make-up and long-sleeve shirts to allegedly hide injuries she had inflicted. Following an unsubstantiated abuse claim in 2009, a teacher aide at the girl's school alerted authorities in November 2010 after noticing welts and bruises on the girl. Police spoke to the mother and although the woman admitted she had slapped the girl, she wasn't charged. The Child Safety department put the girl in foster care but she was returned to her mother nine days later as it was believed she would be safe. Her mother, who can't be named for legal reasons, is serving a seven-year sentence after last year pleading guilty to manslaughter . The girl's stepfather was receiving Centrelink payments while the child's school was told the family had moved overseas. He was sentenced to three years in jail on the same charge for ignoring the abuse . An external agency given the role of engaging with the mother closed the case in January 2011 after the woman said she was moving to New Zealand. The agency didn't speak to the girl and never told Child Safety it was no longer in touch with the woman. After the abuse claim in November 2010 the mother removed the girl from her school, which also mistakenly believed the girl and her family were heading overseas. The school, which told Child Safety about the family's plans, had no way of tracking whether the girl had been enrolled overseas. The school principal, who said he had lost a lot of sleep over the case, said if the school had had access to the stepfather's Centrelink data, they would have known the girl remained in Cairns. On November 28, 2011, the girl was found dead in her bedroom days after being repeatedly beaten by her mother. The eight-year-old was found dead at her Cairns home after being repeatedly hit with a vacuum cleaner pipe in November 2011 . During the inquest the court heard there were serious communication issues between government departments and the external agency. In her final submissions on Friday, Ms Williams criticised Child Safety, saying it didn't do enough to protect the girl from her abusive mother. But she conceded departmental staff in Cairns were overworked and under-resourced. The issues, first raised in 2009, were not addressed until after the girl's death. Ms Williams also said the external agency shared the blame. The child safety officer involved said the case was distressing and had caused her anxiety, but said she believed she had made the best decisions under the circumstances. The department's barrister, Karen Carmody, told the inquest there wasn't a direct link between the death and how the department dealt with the 'deeply troubling case'. But reviews and significant changes had since been implemented, she said. 'It's easy to attack the department but in reality it was the mother and stepfather,' Ms Carmody told the court. An independent reviewer looking at child safety systems following the death was so troubled by how under-resourced the Cairns office was she called urgent meetings with top officials. Ms Williams recommended data-sharing between Centrelink, police and the child safety and education departments. Northern coroner Jane Bentley will hand down her findings and recommendations on Friday.","An eight-year-old girl was found dead at her home in Cairns, Queensland in November 2011 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A senior aide within Ed Miliband’s office who was blamed for the leader's embarrassing Hillsborough gaffe has become embroiled in an alleged bullying row, it has emerged. Anna Yearley, the Labour leader’s political secretary, has been accused of bullying Gemma Tumelty - a junior member of staff who worked as the party’s stakeholder relations manager. Ms Yearley, 35, is alleged to have treated the 33-year-old poorly, resulting in her leaving the party office last month, inside sources reportedly claimed. Anna Yearley (pictured), the Labour leader¿s political secretary, has been accused of bullying Gemma Tumelty - a junior member of staff who worked as the party's stakeholder relations manager . Ms Tumelty, the former president of the National Union of Students, is said to have received a ‘pay-off’ and signed a confidentiality agreement, The Times reported. It is alleged senior figures received an email informing them Ms Tumelty had resigned for family reasons and staff were asked not to contact her. Ms Yearley, who remains in post, works closely with Mr Miliband and acts as a liaison between the Labour leader and MPs. She became head of his political office after serving on his leadership campaign in 2010 and has previously worked as a member of Gordon Brown’s political staff. A spokesman speaking on behalf of the Labour party told MailOnline today: ‘We do not comment on staffing matters' and said Ms Yearley would not be making any comment on the matter. Gemma Tumelty, 33, who is the former president of the National Union of Students, is said to have received a 'pay-off' and signed a confidentiality agreement before leaving the position last month, it has been claimed . Ms Tumelty declined to comment when approached by The Times. The allegations come after Mr Miliband was forced to apologise last week after posing with a copy of The Sun. The Labour leader, who boasted of standing up to Mr Murdoch during the phone hacking scandal, attempted to mend fences in the run-up to the next election by posing with a World Cup souvenir edition of the tabloid. But the picture provoked anger among Labour activists, particularly in Liverpool, where the newspaper is boycotted due to its coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Ms Yearley was blamed for failing to predict the political fallout and the Labour leader was forced to issue an humiliating apology, saying he was ‘very, very sorry’ for causing offence. The apology capped a dismal week for the party leader. His new slogan ‘Hardworking Britain Better Off’ was condemned as ‘divisive’ at a meeting of Labour’s ruling national Executive Committee (NEC). Ms Yearley was blamed for failing to predict the political fallout after Labour leader Ed Miliband came under fire for posing with a copy of The Sun, which provoked anger among Labour activists, particularly in Liverpool . NEC member Ann Black said a poll she conducted of more than 200 party members found that 98 per cent ‘hated’ it because it appeared to criticise the unemployed. She said activists described the slogan as ‘divisive, meaningless’ and ‘sounding like a Tory slogan’. On immigration, senior Labour MP John Mann said that the ‘metropolitan elite’ had no idea about its impact on the lives of ordinary people. He accused Miliband and other members of the leadership of living ‘different lives to the voters whose support they need’. He also said the Labour leadership was ‘reluctant to recognise the downsides’ of mass immigration. MailOnline has contacted Ms Tumelty for comment.","Political secretary , 35, accused of bullying a junior employee .

The mock trial outlined how police Chief Gorden Eden has failed to stop his officers from using excessive force, said David Correia, one of the protest's organizers. 'He has to answer to these charges,' Correia said. 'They'll all be read before the public.' Eden, who took the job four months ago while the Justice Department was wrapping up its investigation into the department, said in a statement that police talked to protest organizers and officers would provide traffic escorts for the marchers. Hundreds of protesters (not pictured),marched to fight against local police brutality . 'We acknowledge their First Amendment rights to voice their concerns,"" Eden said. ""Our job will be to protect public safety during the time they are in Roosevelt Park and while they are marching. Additional officers will be on call in case they are needed.' Previous demonstrations have roiled New Mexico's largest city. At one protest, riot police deployed tear gas toward a violent crowd. Another demonstration prompted city councilors to abruptly end a scheduled meeting. Albuquerque and Justice Department officials are negotiating over reforms that federal authorities are expected to order in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the Police Department has announced a number of new changes to training and has ordered officers to stop shooting at moving vehicles.

"By . Ian Gallagher In Rio De Janeiro . After the ignominy of England’s early exit from the World Cup, Kai Rooney showed his father Wayne how it should have been done during a kick-about on the beach in Brazil. The four-year-old was seen in tears after watching England lose to Uruguay on Thursday, but he bounced back to show off his own footballing skills on Ipanema beach in Rio De Janeiro, watched by his mother Coleen. In contrast, his father appeared despondent as he and goalkeeper Joe Hart braved a press conference yesterday to apologise in person to travelling fans for the team’s dismal performance. He shoots! He scores! Rooney hits the back of the net. Only this time it's Kai Rooney not daddy Wayne . Kai Rooney doesn't let a bit of sand stop him from giving his all in this game of football . Working out with his trainer: Kai Rooney gets his arms strengthened by his physio aka mother Coleen . Wayne Rooney said it was ‘very disappointing… and it’s not a great feeling to go out of the tournament after two games’. He earlier posted on Facebook: ‘Going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn’t worked out. Sorry to all the fans who travelled and at home that we haven’t done better… gutted!’ Other players offered similar sentiments, with Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere tweeting: ‘Gutted doesn’t come close to how I am feeling right now. Sorry to all the fans who came out and supported us, and everyone back home!’ Following their elimination, the players mooched around their hotel, the Royal Tulip, on Friday night – although manager Roy Hodgson enjoyed a burger and chips and bottles of Heineken with FA chairman Greg Dyke and coaching staff in an American diner. Afterwards, the big question of the day was not how to rebuild his shattered squad but which ice cream to select. Hodgson questioned the waiter at length about the flavours and possible combinations, pondering his decision as if considering who to play up front. Back at the hotel, Hodgson, Dyke and Neville settled themselves in a corner of the bar and drank wine, calling it a day at just gone 11pm. Earlier, during the Italy-Costa Rica match, Hodgson looked careworn. Italy needed to beat Costa Rica to give his boys a slither of hope of remaining in the World Cup but lost 1-0. Daddy's turn: An understandably dejected Wayne Rooney faces the press ahead of England's meaningless game against Costa Rica . Pensive: England goalkeeper Joe Hart (left), and Wayne Rooney wait for the first question at a press conference after a squad training session  ahead of the game against Costa Rica . The joy of scoring his first World Cup goal for England cannot hide Wayne Rooney's unhappiness at the post-training press conference . Along with Dyke, most of the players and the backroom staff, the 66-year-old England manager watched the game on a giant screen in the hotel’s heavily guarded conference room. Dyke was the first to appear as the final whistle signalled the end for Roy’s boys. This was the man who appeared to demonstrate his view of England’s chances by making a throat-slitting gesture when the draw was announced last December. This time, he threw his hands up in despair and sighed deeply. ‘Could have done without that,’ he said. Next came Hodgson, who, when asked how the players were bearing up, bit hard on his bottom lip before saying: ‘Bit disappointed.’ Southampton defender Luke Shaw, 18, admitted later: ‘It’s horrible, just horrible, the worst feeling of my life. Everyone’s in bits.’","Kai, 4, was in tears after watching England lose to Uruguay on Thursday .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A toddler has been left traumatised after watching his tiny chihuahua puppy get 'torn apart' by a Staffordshire bull terrier. Lawson Morgan-Cockburn, two, was out walking with his mother Sarah Morgan, 26, and their three chihuahuas when their youngest dog, a one-year-old named Bruno, was set upon. Bull terrier Lennox, who was adopted by his owners as a rescue dog a year ago, escaped from a garden before mauling puppy Bruno while Lawson was still holding his lead. Sarah Morgan, 26, says her two-year-old son Lawson has been left traumatised after watching his one-year-old chihuahua puppy Bruno mauled to death in front of him . Miss Morgan said: 'It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen. The Staffy burst through a gate and started attacking one of my other dogs, named Maddie. 'Little Bruno started yapping at the Staffy trying to stop it - and the terrier turned on him instead. 'Bruno's head was in the terrier's jaws and it just clamped down. He had Bruno's entire head and front legs in his mouth and he was shaking him around like a rag doll. 'Lawson started to scream. I picked him up and ran away as fast as I could. I knew there was nothing I could do for Bruno. My focus was to get Lawson to safety.' Bruno was mauled to death by rescue-dog Lennox, a Staffordshire bull terrier, while Lawson was still holding his lead . Miss Morgan, from Aspatria in Cumbria, said the terrier attacked after becoming agitated as the group walked past a neighbour's garden. She said: 'I could see that the terrier was getting annoyed at us being there - it was barking and running back and forward in the garden. 'I apologised to the owner's girlfriend, who was in the garden, and she told me not to worry, because the dog was secured in the garden and couldn't get out through the gate. 'The next thing I knew, the terrier had managed to escape and had opened the gate itself and got through.' 'Lots of neighbours rushed out and tried to pull the terrier off, but nobody could stop it. 'Lawson was screaming his head off. The whole village must have heard - it was a frenzy of gnashing teeth and screaming. 'The dog turned and I could tell it wanted blood. It had a look in its eyes - it was throwing Bruno round like a chew toy. That dog is evil. It could have gone for my son.' Miss Morgan said the attack only stopped when the terrier's owner managed to drag the dog back inside. She said: 'The Staffy unlocked its jaws when it realised Bruno was dead and  its fun was over. 'When we examined Bruno afterwards I . saw that all the fur was missing where he was bitten. You could see all . the puncture wounds and was covered in blood and slather. He looked torn . apart.' Miss Morgan, a waitress, said Lawson has suffered with night terrors since the incident. Last month, the Dangerous Dogs . Act was amended to make it a criminal offence for a person in charge of . a dog to allow it to be dangerously out of control in a public place. Cumbria police have said no charges have been brought. The attack happened as Ms Morgan was walking her three chihuahuas with Lawson. The bull terrier escaped from his owners' garden after becoming agitated before grabbing hold of Bruno . Ms Morgan said that she ran away as the terrier grabbed hold of Bruno, trying to get Lawson to safety. She said the attack only stopped after the bull terrier's owner managed to pull him away . Lenny Graham, 27, the owner of the six-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier named Lennox, said he was taking a bath in his house when Lennox escaped through the gate. He said: 'Most of the neighbours had come out and were standing around. I saw the other dog lying on the ground. 'I tried to go up to the lass to apologise but under the circumstances, she didn't want to say anything. It's understandable. 'I feel so sorry for that lad. I'm riddled with guilt over it. It was an accident. 'We only let Lennox in the garden when we're out there too. We let him have a bit of fresh air between walks, otherwise we keep him in the house. 'Lennox had an awful life before he came to me. He was locked in a room for the first five years of his life. 'He's been excellent with us. He's very good with children and other dogs. I've tried to reach out to the family to offer my condolences but they don't want to talk to me.'","Sarah Morgan, 26, was out walking three chihuahuas with son Lawson .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Frisbee catching has been banned from a country dog show today on the grounds of health and safety amid fears the pets could injure themselves when taking part. It is one of three events to be either dropped or altered at Scruffs Dog Show in Keswick, Cumbria, after organisers cited health and safety concerns. Show organisers took the ‘bizarre’ decision to drop both the 'highest frisbee jump' and the 'highest biggest catch' categories over fears the competing dogs could injure themselves. The Kennel Club, which has named the town the UK’s most dog-friendly on two occasions, supported the decision. Frisbee catching has been banned from  Scruffs Dog Show in Keswick, Cumbria today on the grounds of health and safety amid fears the pets could strain or injure themselves when taking part (file picture) Tony Lywood, one of the show’s organisers, said a third category – 'best biggest catcher' – had also been toned down for safety reasons. Instead of jumping to catch the biscuit, dogs will instead be sitting down when taking part. Mr Lywood said the decision was made after fellow organisers raised concerns about the competing dogs’ wellbeing. He said: ‘In shows elsewhere there have been occasions where dogs have jumped high and twisted their back, and there was one where the dog had to be put down. ‘The committee made the decision reluctantly, we were advised it was a better thing to do even though it sounds counterintuitive and bizarre. ‘I think we probably made the right decision, we just want to avoid any dogs getting hurt. ‘Health and safety has finally hit dogs.’ Organisers decided to drop both the 'highest frisbee jump' and the 'highest biggest catch' categories over fears the dogs could get hurt. More than 500 people are set to attend the show in Keswick, Cumbria (above) The Kennel Club endorsed the show's decision. A spokesman said: ‘The Kennel Club encourages fun sports and activities for dogs in order to keep them fit and healthy. ‘But it has concerns about the game of frisbee, particularly in its more extreme forms. ‘While it can be safe in controlled conditions, if it is thrown at great heights or awkward angles, leading the dog to jump and twist, it can cause strain and injury on landing so care should always be taken.’ More than 500 people are expected to descend on Fitz Park in Keswick today for the dog show, which will see 28 dogs taking part in 24 different categories. Other categories will see prizes awarded to the dog with the most appealing eyebrows, the waggiest tail, the longest tongue and the one which most looks like its owner.","'Highest frisbee jump' category dropped from Scruffs Dog Show in Cumbria .

"By . John Stevens . Schools will be shut down if they fail to promote British values under plans to root out extremism in the classroom to be unveiled this week. Education Secretary Michael Gove will announce all pupils must be taught about democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance of those of different beliefs. Schools will also be banned from forcing Muslim girls to wear the veil or sit apart from boys as part of an outlawing of discrimination. Education Secretary Michael Gove will set out the plans for teaching British values this week . They will be required to challenge parents, teachers or pupils who express support for radical Islamic practices or other forms of extremism. Overhauled Ofsted inspections will check that schools are meeting the new requirements. Headteachers and governors could be sacked or the school closed if they are found not to be. Before now, academies and free schools had to show they ‘respect’ the nation’s ‘fundamental’ values, but the new rules, which will apply to all schools, will be strengthened to require the ‘active promotion’ of them. The new rules, which will come into effect from September, are being introduced in the wake of the ‘Trojan Horse’ allegations of a takeover plot in Birmingham schools by hardline Muslims. Head teachers told Ofsted there was an organised campaign to impose a ‘narrow, faith-based ideology’ at some schools in the city. It placed five of the city’s schools in special measures after ‘deeply worrying’ findings. The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' in new Oftsed inspections ordered in the wake of concerns about teaching in Birmginham schools . Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils . Reports found music lessons had been removed from the timetable at one school, where Muslim pupils exhibited ‘limited knowledge’ of other religions. Raffles were banned at one primary school because they were considered ‘un- Islamic’ as they promoted gambling and one academy’s Christmas special assembly was also cancelled. In addition, inspectors found the terms ‘white prostitute’ and ‘hellfire’ were used in assemblies. A consultation will be launched this week setting out the details of the new rules. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Keeping our children safe and ensuring schools prepare them for life in modern Britain could not be more important. This change is an important step towards ensuring we have a strong legal basis for intervening in those schools where this is an issue. ‘The vast majority of schools already promote British values - this is about making sure we have the tools we need to intervene if children are being let down.’","Education Secretary Michael Gove to set out new rules for England .

Luis Suarez got the better of England's defenders on Thursday - including Gary Cahill (pictured) - to score two and leave the team's hopes in tatters . Unhappy goalie Joe Hart faces questions at the press conference . Rooney had taken to Facebook to apologise of the dismal performances, admitting, 'It hasn't worked out'. The Manchester United forward told his 21 million Facebook fans: ‘Going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn't worked out. Sorry to all the fans that travelled and at home that we haven't done better. Gutted.’ Rooney was backed by his Red Devils teammate and Dutch captain Robin Van Persie who said: ‘I don't think you can blame him for scoring one goal, working his socks off and missing three chances by inches. ‘He gave his all for his country, like he always does. He's a great player, a great goal scorer, so I don't think it's fair on him to criticise him that much.’ Striker Daniel Sturridge said that he felt ‘sick’ and ‘heartbroken’, while captain Gerrard added: ‘We maybe should have accepted that going for a point [against Uruguay] might have been the best option.’ The lack of morale does not bode well for .

Dyke said Hodgson remained the right man for the task, telling Sky Sports News: ‘He came to do a four-year cycle. ‘People have been asking the question: ""Will he stay?"" Well, the answer is yes.’ Costa . Rica, who are ranked 28th in the world, were written off before the . tournament but have so far shocked fans and foes alike to beat both .

Wayne Rooney may have scored his first World Cup goal on Thursday against Uruguay, but two strikes and two goals from Luis Suarez either side of that meant England's campaign was all but over. Perhaps the only consolation is that Spain, reigning world and European champions, fared just as badly as England, crashing out after being thrashed 5-1 by the Netherlands and 2-0 by Chile.

"By . Ian Drury . and Rob Davies . The crisis in Iraq could push up petrol prices by 4p-a-litre, heaping pressure on hard-pressed families and threatening to derail the economic recovery. The escalating violence has sent oil prices spiralling to a nine-month high of $115 a barrel – raising the prospect that this will soon be felt on forecourts across Britain. Uncertainty over oil supplies from Iraq, which accounts for nearly four per cent of the world’s production, came amid fresh signs that the army is losing its battle with the terror group Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). The escalating violence has sent oil prices spiralling to a nine-month high of $115 a barrel - raising the prospect that this will soon be felt on forecourts across Britain . As US Secretary of State John Kerry travelled to the Middle East to warn the region was at a ‘critical moment’, it emerged the ruthless fanatics had captured two border crossings and four towns. Fuel retailers warned the crisis would lead to higher prices at the pumps in Britain with motorists facing a ‘difficult summer ahead’. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ‘We see maybe another 2p added […] initially and then, over the next couple of weeks maybe 3p or 4p.’ The average price of a litre of petrol currently is 130p, with diesel at 135p. Chancellor George Osborne last week warned the Cabinet that the conflict could wreck the economic revival by driving up oil prices. His intervention that Britain’s vital interests were at stake was seen evidence he believed Britain should support American military action in Iraq. As US Secretary of State John Kerry travelled to the Middle East to warn the region was at a 'critical moment', it emerged the ruthless fanatics had captured two border crossings and four towns . His aides played down suggestions he was in favour of military options, but a Cabinet colleague said: ‘George’s comments were that we have to appreciate the seriousness of the consequences for us. ‘He reminded us that we already faced consequences with the hike in oil prices.’ Economic analysts said the global economy could be plunged into fresh decline if oil prices continue to rise. Capital Economics warned of an ‘ugly’ worst-case scenario, in which Iraq’s production of 3.3million barrels a day is significantly disrupted, sending oil soaring to $140 a barrel. Some 90 per cent of Iraqi oil comes from the largely Shia south of the country, which has so far been unaffected by the lightening offensive from ISIS. But Sunni militants could spread chaos using terrorism, as they did by sabotaging a key pipeline in the northern province of Anbar in March. Yesterday the Islamist extremists seized captured the Turaibil border crossing with Jordan and the al-Walid crossing with Syria after government forces retreated. It followed the fall of the towns of Qaim, Rawah, Anah and Rutba, all in Anbar province, since Friday. The gains could help ISIS transport fighters, weapons and other equipment to different battlefields. Iraqi Shiite tribal fighters deploy outside the Shiite holy city of Najaf, 100 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq . Sunni militants on Sunday captured two border crossings, one along the frontier with Jordan and the other with Syria, security and military officials said, as they pressed on with their offensive in one of Iraq's most restive regions . The offensive appeared to be part of a march toward a key dam in the city of Haditha, the destruction of which would damage the country’s electrical grid and cause major flooding. The Iraqi army responded by deploying 2,000 troops to protect the dam. Speaking in Cairo, Mr Kerry warned ISIS’s ‘ideology of violence and repression is a threat not only to Iraq but to the entire region’. Calling it a ‘critical moment’, he urged Iraq’s leaders ‘to rise above sectarian motivations and form a government that is united in its determination to meet the needs and speak to the demands of all of their people’. Washington is refusing to heed the Iraq government’s calls for US airstrikes against insurgents to help deal with the crisis. US president Barack Obama wants a new government in Iraq, without Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who he blames for endangering the country by launching a crackdown on Sunnis, before authorising military action. But Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned the prospect of US intervention in Iraq, saying Washington’s main intention was to keep Iraq within its own sphere of power. Dismissing talk of sectarianism, he said: ‘The main dispute in Iraq is between those who want Iraq to join the US camp and those who seek an independent Iraq.’ He said the US aimed to ‘bring its own blind followers to power’. Khamenei’s anti-US remarks weaken the possibility, raised last week, that the two old enemies could co-operate to tackle the conflict.","Violence has sent oil prices spiralling to a nine-month high of $115 a barrel .

"By . Ashley Collman . Four years ago last Friday, Colorado hiker Zak Anderegg came across a sad scene while exploring an Arizona canyon. After repelling 350 feet down into the heart of the gorge he found an abandoned puppy, rail thin and starving. Thanks to Mr Anderegg's quick work, the dog named Riley survived and found a new, loving, home with his rescuer. 'He has become a cherished member of our family,' Mr Anderegg wrote on Riley's Facebook fan page. 'He is without doubt one of the sweetest dogs I've ever known.' Scroll down for video . Rescued: Zak Anderegg found this malnourished puppy abandoned at the bottom of an Arizona canyon four years ago . Happy dog: Four years later, the puppy named Riley is alive and well and living with his rescuer in Colorado . Mr Anderegg documented Riley's dramatic rescue on camera and the resulting footage has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. In the 14 minute clip, Riley is first seen eating a bowl of water and dog food that Mr Anderegg fetched after finding the abandoned pup. 'As far as I'm concerned, the only way he got here without having broken legs is someone actually put him here,' Mr Anderegg says in the footage from June 20, 2010. Left to die: Mr Anderegg found Riley while exploring this canyon in Arizona on June 20, 2010 .

Resting: Mr Anderegg then took Riley to an animal hospital to regain his strength . Getting better: A few days later, Riley was cleared to go home with Mr Anderegg, though the puppy was still very weak . Mr Anderegg then leaves Riley with the food and a towel for a bed to return home for rescue supplies. The following morning Mr Anderegg repelled into the canyon again, this time equipped with a cage to pull the dog safely out. Riley was then taken to a local animal hospital where the abused pup he was treated for malnutrition. Mr Anderegg decided to adopt Riley and helped nurse the puppy back to full health.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . An NHS boss is on a pay deal worth £190,000-a-year to work as little as one day a week. Christopher Langley was appointed chairman of Medway Foundation Trust after it was put into special measures. Details of his contract reveal he is paid more than £170,000, plus another £17,000 in expenses, for working ‘an average of one or two days a week’. Chris Langley has been employed on a deal worth almost £200,000 in pay and expenses to be chairman of Medway Foundation Trust which runs Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent . Health groups have condemned the huge deal, worth enough to pay for more than eight nurses. The health watchdog Monitor appointed Mr Langley in February after the hospital trusts was found to have higher-than-expected death rates and failing on patient safety. The one-year initial contract sets out how he is paid through a company, Trust and West Easton Consulting Ltd, of which he is a director. He receives £14,400 in pay each month, plus expenses worth 10 per cent of his salary, at £1,440. Over a year it is worth £190,080. By comparison, Mr Langley’s predecessor received just £40,000 to £45,000. Mr Langley’s contract states: ‘Remuneration will be paid at the rate of £12,000 plus VAT per month, invoiced monthly in advance to the Trust by WECL. ‘A fixed monthly amount of 10 per cent of the fee plus VAT will be charged to the Trust to cover expenses. ‘Under these terms, there is no entitlement to compensation for loss of office.’ The contract adds that he must devote ‘sufficient time to ensure satisfactory discharge’ of his duties. ‘This should be an average of one or two days a week (including time spent attending meetings and preparing for meetings of the Board or the Council of Governors either at Trust premises or elsewhere).’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, condemned the 'astonishing' pay deal . In addition to being a director and shareholder of West Eaton Consulting Ltd, Mr Langley is also a business partner at 38 Devonshire Street, a private dental practice in London. He is a director of OM Interactive Ltd, which sells multi-sensory equipment, Asteral Ltd, which sells medical equipment to the NHS, and seminars@thirtyeight limited, which hosts public speakers at the dental practice. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, told the Telegraph: ‘It is alarming that such vast sums of money are being spent in this way. ‘At a time when the NHS is under such huge financial pressures, this type of waste is unacceptable. ’She added it was ‘shocking that such vast sums of money can be claimed without having to produce receipts.’ Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing said: “It’s astonishing to see how liberally the NHS is still prepared to dish out pay packages like this. ‘At a time when nurses are struggling to make ends meet, these are eye-watering sums of money.’ A spokesman for Monitor said: ‘When we took action in February, Medway was one of the most challenged foundation trusts in the country and faced a range of serious issues. ‘The trust needed the right people in place to make the urgent improvements needed for its patients, which is why the interim chair and chief executive were appointed.’","Christopher Langley appointed chairman of Medway Foundation Trust .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Angela Wegg, pictured, pocketed £43,000 in disability allowance by claiming she struggled to dress and cook for herself. However, she was actually working two jobs . A mother who claimed £43,000 in benefits by saying she needed help washing and dressing was working two jobs in a bakery and a nursing home, a court heard. Angela Wegg, 34, from Ipswich, Suffolk, told authorities her disability meant she needed help washing, dressing and cooking meals. In a claim form for Disability Living Allowance, the mother-of-two said she struggled with mobility - and could only walk one to three metres. But Department of Work and Pensions investigators launched an urgent probe after receiving a tip-off she had two jobs. Investigators discovered that Wegg . had been working in the bakery at a Tesco store in Ipswich as well as . at the town’s Monmouth Court care home. They also saw Wegg walking over two miles with her two German Shepherd dogs as well as walking her children to school without using an aid. The court heard how Wegg, who suffers from a syndrome which affects connective tissues in her body, pocketed £43,000 over a period of seven years by failing to notify the authorities her health had improved. Wegg admitted dishonestly failing to notify a change in her circumstances between November 2005 and June 2013. Sentencing her, Judge David Goodin said Wegg had the 'dreadful misfortune' to suffer from a hereditary illness. But . he said although her original Disability Living Allowance was . genuine, she had failed to notify the authorities when she became able to . work and walk more than three metres or about 10 feet. Wegg was given a four-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months . and ordered to attend a Women’s Emotional Well Being course. Wegg had no previous convictions - and was ordered to repay the . amount she had been overpaid in £20-a-month installments. Ipswich Crown Court heard how Wegg's secret employment proved she did not need the benefits she was being handed. Marcus Croskell, prosecuting, said both her jobs were physically demanding. He added: 'Part of these duties involved bending, stretching, walking and carrying items.' The court was told how Wegg was prescribed oral morphine by her GP to control her pain last November. Despite claiming she could only walk one to three metres, the mother-of-one was holding down two jobs - one at a Tesco bakery and another at Monmouth Court Care Home, pictured . However, Declan Gallagher, defending, accepted that Wegg’s capabilities became greater than she had declared. He added she hadn’t been living an 'extravagant lifestyle' and her jobs had only paid the minimum wage. A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later in the year. A DWP spokesman said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime and, if convicted, you will be handed a criminal record and be ordered to pay back the money. 'Don’t wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.' Wegg, who suffers from a condition that affects connective tissue in her body, failed to notify authorities when her condition improved, the court was told. She fraudulently claimed £43,000 over seven years - and was handed a four month suspended sentence .","Angela Wegg, 34, told authorities she could only walk one to three meters .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Digg founder Kevin Rose has decided not to go ahead with plans to bulldoze his historic Oregon home after his neighbors' protest sparked a last-minute change of heart. Rose, who founded the news site Digg before joining Google, paid $1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in Portland. But when he revealed plans to demolish the five-bedroom house and build a new one on the site, neighbors started a petition to try to save the property. Digg founder Kevin Rose has decided not to go ahead with plans to bulldoze his historic Oregon home after his neighbors' protest sparked a last-minute change of heart . But now it has been revealed that Rose has reportedly agreed to sell the house to Tom and Jennifer Saunders, long-time residents of the neighborhood, reports Oregon Live. 'There has been a tentative agreement that has been reached that the house will be sold to Tom and Jennifer Saunders,' said Will Aitchison, the Portland attorney representing a neighborhood coalition. 'The hope by all concerned is that the sale will be completed by Friday. The sale will be for $1.375 million, the amount requested by Rose. We're all extremely hopeful that this is resolved.' Aitchison released the following statement from Kevin and Darya Rose: . 'Darya and I are happy to announce that we've come to an agreement with a long-time resident of Willamette Heights to sell 1627 NW 32nd Ave. The new buyer's intention is not to demolish the house, but rather restore and maintain it. While this agreement isn't fully finalized, we are hoping we can wrap things up quickly. Rose, who founded the news site Digg before joining Google, paid $1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in Portland . 'Over the last few days we've watched as comments and emotions flared on both sides of the issue. Some folks arguing for homeowner rights, others for the preservation of old homes. We've read all of this, along with your emails, and took it all to heart. 'We decided on Portland not as an investment property, or vacation spot, but as a place we hope to one day call home, a place to raise our family. We love so much about your beautiful city, and your strong community bond is high up on that list. While we could have legally put our heads down and proceeded forward, that's not the type of relationship we want with our neighbors and our new city friends. But when he revealed plans to demolish the five-bedroom house and build a new one on the site, neighbors started a petition to try to save the property . Updates: Rose and his wife had planned to remodel the five-bedroom house . Extra work: The couple then put in plans to demolish the family home because of concern over asbestos . The house, which was built in 1892, has been described as one of the 'great icons of Northwest Portland'. Last week however, a permit was issued to tear the property down after Rose had it removed from an historic homes inventory. Steve . Wilson, who was one of the agents who listed the property, said he knew . Rose and his wife Darya planned a remodel, but said he was shocked to . hear it was going to be pulled down. 'We . did expect him to do a substantial remodel, but you pay $1.3 million . and tear a house down? In Portland? That doesn't happen in,' he told the . Oregonian. An online petition set up by the couple's new neighbors attracted more than 1,100 signatures since being set live. In . an open letter addressed to Rose and his wife, the petition states: . 'When several of us met you at this year’s Easter egg hunt, we were . eager to find out about your plans. 'We were reassured that you had no plans to build on the spare lot, and were relieved to hear that you were committed to remodeling rather than demolishing the house.' It added that the neighbors had been shocked to later hear that the property had been removed from Portland's landmark inventory and was set to be demolished. Rose then responded to the petition, releasing a statement that claimed the couple had been left no choice after receiving a quote for remodeling that was more than the house price. Despite having surveys done before agreeing to buy the house, the couple later discovered extensive repairs were needed. Rose said that they asked the previous owner to buy back the house and fix the asbestos and other issues with it, and said if the demolition went ahead the materials would be recycled. Unlisted: Kevin Rose had the house removed from a list of potentially significant properties . 'We never intended to deceive anyone, as some of you have accused. We simply wanted to create a beautiful home for our family,' Rose said. He added that the house had been listed as potentially significant on a voluntary register, but when an independent architect inspected it, they assured the couple it was not historically important. Rose said the couple had hoped to just carry out an extensive remodel but 'the costs were higher than we anticipated, and we knew we could never recoup that kind of money on a 100 year-old house'. Jim Draudt and Ann Witsil, who the Roses bought the house from, have also backed the petition to save the property, issuing a statement praising neighbors for raising concerns about the demolition. 'The only solution acceptable to us is to save the house, not to remove it,' the couple wrote.","Rose planned to demolish five-bedroom house and build a new one .

Mr Sorrill came up with idea of creating the hotel after spending 12 years in property development in the Caribbean. After developing Indigo Bay, a thatched hut resort in Grand Cayman, the 44 -year-old decided to bring the idea home to Somerset, England. He added: ‘Glastonbury 2011 is where the Pop-up made its first appearance, and it’s really taken off from there. ‘We really aim to design the tents and hotel to match the surroundings, so naturally for Glastonbury, we try and make the tents quite arty, but still very classic and British. ‘It takes 20 to 30 people around two and half weeks to set up the site for the festival.’ The hotel also still has ‘American-style’ vintage caravans available that have a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and sofa to watch the festival in comfort on.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . The bodies of nearly 500 babies were handed over to Irish universities for research over a 25-year period, it emerged today. New figures show the unclaimed remains of 474 infants who died in mother-and-baby homes and hospitals were used for anatomical study in medical departments. They were given to four Irish universities between 1940 and 1965 apparently without consent. The revelation comes amid controversy surrounding mother-and-baby homes in Ireland after the discovery that as many 800 infants may be buried in a mass grave outside a former home. Trinity College Dublin (pictured in 1946) was among four universities which used the unclaimed remains of nearly 500 infants who died in mother-and-baby home and hospitals for research between 1940 and 1965 . The colleges - the University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin and NUI Galway - were allowed to receive bodies donated by the individual or volunteered by a next-of-kin or loco parentis under the Anatomy Act of 1832. However, the practice stopped in the mid-1960s after a public campaign by anatomy professors to encourage public donations. All donations must now been made with informed consent. In a statement to the Irish Independent, . the anatomical committee of Irish medical schools said: 'Practices have . long been in place to ensure absolute procedural sensitivity towards . donors and families.' The four universities have also now set . up helplines for the first time for families who want details about the . remains of relatives. The University College Dublin used the unclaimed bodies of 249 babies for research before the practices was stopped in the mid-1960s following a public campaign to encourage public donation, new figures show . University College Dublin - 249 . Trinity College Dublin - 103 . Royal College of Surgeons - 87 . NUI Galway - 35 . Total - 474 . The practice is expected to form part of the government's Commission of Investigation, of which an inital review report is due out early next week. The Department of Health is also drawing up the Human Tissue Bill which set out new arrangements for the donations of bodies to anatomy schools. Earlier this month, Irish premier, Enda Kenny, ordered ministers to see whether there are more mass baby graves after a researcher found records showing that 796 children, mostly infants, died in a home in Tuam, County Galway, which operated from 1925 until 1962. Residents suspect they were interred in a nearby field, including in a disused septic tank. Ireland had some 10 such mother-and-baby homes run by different orders until the 1960s.","Unclaimed remains handed to four Irish colleges from 1940 to 1965 .

"By . Sally Lee . Big Day Out fans are mourning the loss of one of the most highly anticipated music festivals after organisers announced the annual event won't be back in Australia or New Zealand next year. 'While we intend to bring back the festival in future years, we can confirm there will not be a Big Day Out in 2015,' American owners of the event, C3 Presents, confirmed on Thursday in a statement. The first inkling that the festival hit financial troubles came after promoters said earlier this year the event wouldn't return to Perth in 2015 after poor ticket sales. Rumours of this year's poor attendance figures and a court dispute between C3 and its former owner AJ Maddah was also reported by Fairfax Media earlier this year. Maddah later said the Big Day Out was cancelled because of a shortage of headline acts, when a Twitter follower asked him: 'is there a shortage of headliners at the moment? Every O/S festival i see headlined by Outkast'. 'Yes. There's a shortage of headliners on cycle this year. Hence BDO taking year off,' he replied. The music event has been on the calendar for Australians since 1992 when grunge rockers Nirvana played on the first bill alongside the American rock band Violent Femmes and Aussie outfit You Am I. Other headlining acts over the years include Iggy Pop, Marilyn Manson, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Ramones, Angus and Julia Stone, The Beastie Boys, Neil Young, M.I.A, Lily Allen, Muse, Pearl Jam and Kanye West.

"By . Ryan Lipman . A Perth café owner illegally deducted money from staff wages if they put tomato on the wrong layer of a club sandwich or served cold pizza. When a female cook's crackling on a pork belly dish was deemed 'not crispy enough', the woman had $112 taken from her pay by the owner, reflective of the total bill from diners at the table which ordered the meal. The café in Subiaco must now pay thousands in compensation and penalties after the Fair Work Ombudsman found the owner was illegally deducting money from staff wages. Paying the price: A Perth café owner illegally deducted money from staff wages for various 'offences' including $30 for putting tomato slices on the wrong layer of a club sandwich . Fair Work received complaints from four staff members and learnt of the various reasons why staff wages were being docked. $30: if tomato was placed in the wrong layer of a club sandwich$18.90: if a hair was found in a breakfast dish$12: for overcooking a waffle$12: for burning an omelette $12: for serving cold pizza$10: for failure to prepare parsley for the following day . Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said the business also illegally deducted $100 from staff pay packets each time an employee was more than five minutes late for a shifts. 'Further, this employer was asking its staff to pay up to $1200 each out of their own pockets for in-house cooking demonstrations by the café's head chef,' she said. The owner deducted staff pay between June, 2012 and May last year and the affected employees were from India and Nepal on Regional Sponsored Migration Visas at the time. None of the affected employees continue to work at the café and they all received $5,000 compensation from their former boss following conciliation before the Fair Work Commission. The ombudsman also issued the business on-the-spot fines totalling $7650 and a Letter of Caution placing it on notice that further contraventions of workplace laws could result in enforcement action. Fair Work inspectors also found the café was failing to issue workers with pay-slips and not keeping accurate time-and-wages records for its employees. While the café is still open for business, it is being monitored to make sure it complies with workplace laws. The café is located in Subiaco, west of Perth CBD, and is being monitored by Fair Work to make sure it complies with workplace laws. Pictured is a stock image of cafés in Perth and not the actual cafés . Ms James said deducting money from employee wages as a punishment, or as a 'performance management tool' was illegal. 'And it is clearly not a constructive way of encouraging staff to improve their performance if there are performance issues that need addressing. She said research showed employee productivity and motivation was at its highest when staff were part of a workplace culture where theirs contribution are valued and they are supported by 'strong' and 'positive' leaders who encourage them. Ms James said the Subicao example is a timely reminder to other employers of the workplace law obligations and that deductions unauthorised by employees and which do not comply with relevant laws are illegal. 'Clearly these deductions only benefited the employer, which is why we have taken this matter seriously and sought a commitment from the business this behaviour will not be repeated,' she said. The Fair Work Ombudsman also considers employers' attempts to exploit vulnerable overseas workers, who often are unaware of their workplace rights, as very serious Ms James added.

"By . Sally Lee . The year was 2009 when a shy and dyslexic Australian 16-year-old defied the odds and set off on a solo unassisted world journey to sail the rough seas - a dream she'd had since the age of 12. Five years later, Jessica Watson, now 21, still seems to be dreaming of her adventures instead of keeping her head in the books. Ms Watson, who was named Young Australian of the Year in 2011, has been studying sociology at university and has documented the 'normal' school life she's having on social media. Jessica Watson is now an average university student studying youth and social work after becoming one of the youngest people to sail around the world in 2009 when she was just 16 . 'Enjoying my first week studying on campus, pretty sure no one has recognised me #touchwood #normal,' she tweeted with a photo of her uni books. Ms Watson also captioned a photo of her study notebooks with water in the background saying: 'Wishing I was sailing rather than studying today'. The teen adventurer from the Gold Coast, Queensland, made headlines when she sailed the world's most challenging seaways for seven months in 2009, including Cape Horn and the Southern Ocean. She sailed back in to Sydney Harbour in May 2010 just before her 17th birthday.

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sally Lee . A week of wild weather in Victoria turned lethal when three men died in a road accident at the scene of a fallen tree. Police say two of the men were trying to clear a pine tree from a road at Broadwater near Warrnambool, southwest of Victoria, on Friday night when a Ford sedan crashed and instantly killed them. A passenger in the car suffered critical injuries and later died in hospital. The Bureau of Meteorology has since issued a severe weather warning covering much of Victoria on Saturday. Wind gusts up to 100km/h are expected before a gusty southwesterly change on Saturday night that could hit some coastal areas with a storm surge. The Bureau of Meteorology predicted strong to gusty northerly winds would reach gale force in Victoria on Saturday . Port Fairy in south-west Victoria saw huge waves which carried rocks on to nearby roads earlier this week . The State Emergency Service in Victoria responded to over 3800 requests for help on Tuesday . Over 80,000 homes were without power in Victoria after storms on Tuesday . Warrnambool's Sergeant Callum McKinnon said there were initially three men at the scene - one was using a chainsaw to cut the tree while the others cleared the branches. The two men - including the one holding the chainsaw - died at the scene on Woolsthorpe-Haywood road after 9pm. Four children in the back seat of the second car escaped injury while the driver was taken to hospital with minor wounds. BoM senior forecaster Stephen King said gusts up to 100km/h were recorded early on Saturday at Mount Hotham, Mt Buller and Kilmore Gap, north of Melbourne. Up to 40cm of snow is expected at the state's ski resorts during the day. A Victoria SES spokesman said they've been 'pretty quiet' since wild conditions on Tuesday. Only 50 distress calls were made to 9am on Saturday across the state . Properties were damaged by severe winds in Melbourne . Trees were uprooted by the gale-force winds on Tuesday . The coastline at Half Moon Bay, near Melbourne, was torn up with boardwalks washed away during the storms . 'Most of the state had wind gusts of 80-90km/h overnight, which is not as high as the winds we saw on Tuesday but was enough to have caused a few fallen trees around the place,' Mr King said. The State Emergency Service had a quiet night despite the strong winds. Only 50 distress calls were made to 9am on Saturday across the state. A severe weather warning for damaging winds has been issued for all districts except the Mallee, with damaging winds to 60km/h and gusts to 100km/h for Saturday. Mr King said a strong cold front associated with an intense low pressure system would begin to move across Victoria from the west from Saturday afternoon, with sustained strong southwesterly winds behind it. This might herald the return of a storm surge when combined with a high tide expected on the southwest coast about midnight. Storm surges were seen in the southwest and Melbourne during Tuesday's storm, when a southwesterly swell combined with high tides to cause minor flooding in areas including Warrnambool, Southbank, Elwood and Frankston. The surge caused damage to piers and boardwalks along the coast.

As could be expected from a wannabe glamourmodel and former prostitute who got a boob job paid by the NHS, Josie Cunningham celebrated her rumoured book deal by taking her clothes off. The 23-year-old showed off the taxpayer's money in a photoshoot recreating Demi Moore's iconic Vanity Fair cover from 1991. Josie, from Leeds, Yorkshire, claims she is bringing out a completely unedited autobiography in a bid to cash in on her new-found notoriety - and she could make £1million. Scroll down for video . Pure class: Retired escort and wannabe glamourmodel Josie Cunningham, who famously had a boob job on the NHS, celebrates her book deals with a naked pregnancy shoot, showing off her stomach tattoo . The seven months pregnant benefits benefactor has announced plans to reveal the inside story of her controversial life and is currently considering two offers of book deals. Miss Cunningham provoked outrage last year when it emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job thanks to the same NHS Trust that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to walk. Miss Cunningham later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction. After a series of further controversies this month, she took to Twitter to announce her book plans yesterday. She tweeted: 'I understand why people are judging me in the way they are, all I ask is that before making your conclusive opinion on me - wait for my book to come out at the end of the year.'

Rob Cooper told MailOnline that the book will be 'Josie's exact words, . completely unedited', meaning spelling and grammar mistakes will be . included.

The site's homepage reads: 'If you are reading this, then its quite likley you have read something about my life that has impacted you in either a possitive way, but most likley negativley.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Furious David Cameron kicked EU president Herman van Rompuy out of Downing Street after clashing over Brussels jobs, Downing Street confirmed today. The Prime Minister called a dramatic halt to talks on making Jean-Claude Juncker the new President of the European Commission. When Mr van Rompuy refused to guarantee a vote of all 28 EU leaders, Mr Cameron declared there is ‘no point in continuing this meeting’ and showed him the door. David Cameron welcomed the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, on the steps of Number 10 but barely 40 minutes later he showed him the door . The two men clashed after Mr van Rompuy refused to guarantee allowing a vote on the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission . Moments after the extraordinary snub, Mr van Rompuy left Number 10, saying nothing to waiting reporters. The meeting was held ahead of a summit on Friday, where Mr Cameron was to argue against giving Mr Juncker the job. With a majority of EU leaders - including Germany's Angela Merkel - throwing their weight behind Mr Juncker's candidacy, Mr Cameron was determined to force a vote on the issue. In the end, only Hungary sided with Mr Cameron in voting against Mr Juncker’s appointment, . As chairman of the meeting, Mr van Rompuy held a key position in deciding whether the Juncker candidacy was put to a vote at all. In the end Mr van Rompuy caved in, and allowed the vote Mr Cameron had called for during a Brussels summit on Friday . In last Monday’s meeting Mr Cameron spelt out to Mr van Rompuy why he was determined to fight the issue ""until the end"". The PM said: ‘If it is to be Juncker, I insist on a formal vote.’ But according to one account, Mr van Rompuy replied: ‘I will decide how the vote is conducted.’ Mr Cameron again insisted: ‘You must guarantee there will be a proper vote.’ Mr Van Rompuy responded: ‘I have said I will decide that.’ Becoming increasingly angry, Mr Cameron raged: ‘I don’t want you saying “anyone who agrees with David raise your hands?” after I have spoken. I want a vote, and the names recorded…. ‘If you won’t give me that assurance, there is no point in continuing this meeting,’ he said, according to the Mail on Sunday. At this point Mr Cameron stood up and made clear he would not continue the talks. In a highly unusual move, Downing Street today confirmed the row had ended the meeting earlier. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The meeting lasted for not quite as long as it was scheduled for.’ He added that Mr Cameron was determined to plough ahead with his demands for reform of Europe, despite his defeat on Mr Juncker. ‘The Prime Minister wanted a different outcome on Friday. We were arguing right the way through, an up until the vote, on an issue of principle.’ Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron today insisted he can still secure reforms to Britain's relationship with Europe. 'I am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain's interests in Europe,' he wrote. Only Hungary backed Mr Cameron's opposition to Mr Juncker (right) who had the backing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Referring to previous claims by Mr Juncker that he was ready to deliver a 'fair deal' for Britain, Mr Cameron said: 'If by a fair deal, we can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same place - as some have assumed up to now - then there is business we can do.' Mr Cameron said his decision to stick to his word showed he meant business. He added: 'Anyone in Europe who thought I was going to back down or blink is now thinking again.'","Prime Minister called a halt to high level talks about Jean-Claude Juncker .

Guilty: The 30-year-old from Donegal, Ireland was fined £1,600 after accessing his ex-girlfriend¿s Facebook account to post the offensive status . The man was arrested soon after the incident, when told police he had been upset over the woman’s new partner. His defence lawyer Isobel Kennedy SC told the court the man regretted his actions but that he admitted that he had been drinking before it took place. The man was charged under the Criminal Damage Act 1991, which imposes a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a £8,000 fine. Social media damage: The man admitted to posting as his ex, saying she was a 'whore', after visiting her home to confront her over an alleged infidelity three years ago . The man cannot be named for legal reasons, in order to protect his victim’s identity, as he was acquitted by a jury last month of raping and falsely imprisoning the woman in her home on the same date. Mr Justice Garrett Sheehan called it ‘a reprehensible offence that seriously damaged the woman’s good name but said that “fortunately” the status was quickly spotted and taken down’, the Irish Mail reported.

But the undaunted firefighters performed CPR on the cat, while giving him oxygen through a specially-designed mask meant for rescuing pets. Scroll down for video . Back from the brink: Firefighters used a pet-sized oxygen mask to revive Soldier the cat, whom they plucked from a burning building in Columbia, South Carolina . Alive: After several minutes of CPR, and help from the oxygen mask, soldier came to and was able to take a drink from the firemen who had saved his life . After several minutes, Soldier started breathing normally again, and was able to get up and walk over to another firefighter who gave him a drink after the rescue last Wednesday. The tiny oxygen mask - developed by a firm called Wag'N O2 Fur Life - was bought for the Columbia fire service using donations from the public, local TV station WLTX reported. According to the company, pets usually respond to house fires by finding a hiding place rather than fleeing, making them much more vulnerable to smoke. Tim Gorman, Soldier's owner, told the TV station: 'They nicknamed him Smoky because they didn't know what the cat's name was - he was unresponsive, but they were able to revive him by performing chest compressions.' 'I appreciate everything you've done, everything you guys do.'

Americans appear to be shifting their fast-food . preferences toward fast-casual restaurants that serve higher quality . ingredients.

The participants reported eating at a combined 65 different chains, and ranked each restaurant they tried on a scale of 1 (least delicious) to 10 (most delicious you've ever eaten). The results are then broken down by food category, ranking the best burger joints, taco shops, chicken restaurants and sandwich makers. The 2014 results show a shift in American fast-food preference, with diners placing a new importance on quality over convenience compared to the 2011 report. 'Fast-casual dining in places like Chipotle and Panda Express lets the consumer guide the staff to prepare their meal just the way they like it, Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, a food-service research and consulting firm, told the magazine. Chains like Noodles & Company and Panera, which serve meat produced without antibiotics, also ranked higher on the lists.

"By . John Hall . German police have apologised to a one-armed cyclist after they pulled him over and fined him for riding one-handed. Bogdan Ionescu was travelling through Cologne city centre when he was stopped by overzealous officer who told him he was riding dangerously. Upon realising Mr Ionescu was missing an arm, the overzealous officer turned his attention to the customised bicycle, fining him €25 for having adapted his brakes to work off a single lever - despite the fact doing so was perfectly legal. Ridiculous: One-armed Bogdan Ionescu was travelling through Cologne city centre when he was stopped by overzealous officers who pulled him over and fined him for riding one-handed . Reports of Mr Ionescu's unusual legal issue made national news in Germany this week, and he has since had his fine cancelled and received a full apology from Cologne's police. The officers originally claimed his bicycle breached German safety standards by not having two hand brake levers, as Mr Ionescu had moved so it could be activated using his foot. After a 25 minute argument with the officer at the side of the road - during which he claims the officer also incorrectly accused him of not having legally required lights on his bicycle - Mr Ionescu reluctantly paid the fine as he was running late for a meeting at work. But research by the Kölner Stadtanzeiger newspaper revealed that the modifications Mr Ionescu made to his bicycle - which meant he still had two working brakes - ensured it remained roadworthy. Sorry: Reports of Mr Ionescu's unusual legal issue made national news in Germany this week, and he has since had his fine cancelled and received a full apology from Cologne's police . Although Mr Ionescu says he has . complained about his treatment and reported the officers for . discrimination, police officials claim they were only made aware of the . issue when he took his story to the newspaper. They say that as soon as they realised . the matter needed correcting, administrators contacted Mr Ionescu to . apologise and offer him a refund. There was an initial dispute over how much that refund would be - the police claimed only €5 of the €25 was for the brake level, saying the remaining €20 was punishment for the apparently faulty light. But when Mr Ionescu was able to prove that his light worked off a dynamo powered by his pedals, rather than a battery, a full refund was agreed. Speaking to Kölner Stadtanzeiger, he said he was relieved that the fine had finally been dropped. 'It's great news, I'm really happy,' he said, adding that the incident had been weighing on him over . the past weeks, leaving him frustrated and feeling discriminated against. 'It's good that this is how it ends, it's unbelievably good, he said.","Bogdan Ionescu was accused of riding dangerously through city of Cologne .

"By . John Stevens . The boss of the National Health Service has said he will be ‘disappointed’ if nursing homes still exist in 50 years’ time. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said that he believes better community care and advances in dementia research can be used to help people stay in their homes. It follows public concern about the treatment of the elderly in some care homes in recent years. Care homes will come to be seen as a quirk of the health service at the end of the last century, Simon Stevens argued . Mr Stevens likened the concept of care homes to TB beds, where patients were consigned on wards to be treated with the deadly disease. A combination of technology, more social support and family help means care homes will become seen as a 'particular feature' of the end of the last century. Speaking at Age UK’s For Later Life conference he said: ‘We need to do a better job of keeping out of care homes. Each year about 90,000 people who live at home are admitted to hospital and then are discharged to a care home. ‘Some of those folks clearly will need to be supported in a care home, but probably many could be supported at home. ‘It would be a disappointment if in 30, 40 or 50 years’ time nursing homes still exist. I think we may find that nursing homes are a bit like TB beds were, they were particularly feature of the way care was provided in the latter part of the 20th century. ‘The combination of team-working, technology, and better social support, I hope means that they go the same way over time. ‘When you think about where we are trying to get to with the treating and preventing of Alzheimer’s, it is perfectly imaginable that in 50 years’ time we have a world where there is very little in the way of Alzheimer’s. There is a huge research effort internationally.’ Mr Stevens (right), who took up his role as chief executive of NHS England earlier this year, called for new ways of looking after people at home . Mr Stevens, who took up his role earlier this year, added: ‘We need to think about new ways of supporting people at home. 'We know that the vast majority of people would prefer to be supported in their own homes for as long as possible and continue to be an active part of their communities. 'But often the trend has been pushing in the opposite direction. ‘Something is not working right about how we are providing community nursing and primary care for people at home and the consequence of that is people finding themselves admitted to hospital when we could otherwise avoid that.’ Mr Stevens added that he wanted the term ‘bed blocker’ to be banned in the NHS. He said: ‘We’ve got to tackle ageism. We need to think about the labels that used. The idea that somebody that is stuck in a hospital bed waiting to get home is described as a bed-blocker is offensive and should end.’ In future patients will be treated closer to where they live, he argued. ‘The NHS of the future will be one where more support for frail older patients is provided locally, but where for really major conditions, patients get quick access to centres of excellence. We need both, not either/or. ‘This reminds us that healthcare is constantly changing and the NHS needs to adapt with it. Sometimes we need to centralise in order to save lives, at other times we need to make services more local to meet the needs of patients.’","Simon Stevens says he would be 'disappointed' if they still exist by 2060 .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A two-year-old boy who was taken hostage by a burglar fleeing from police in South Dakota on Tuesday has been rescued after a six-hour ordeal. In a dramatic end to the standoff, officers armed with assault rifles descended on the house in Rapid City and managed to save the toddler without having to fire a single shot. A 32-year-old man, Raymond Cuny, was arrested on suspicion of second-degree kidnapping and second-degree burglary. Scroll down for video . Tense: An armored vehicle and SWAT team surround a Rapid City house on Tuesday after a burglar took a two-year-old boy hostage . The standoff started after police were called to reports of burglary at about 4pm and followed the burglar as he fled to a neighboring property. Several adults and children who were in the house were able to escape but Cuny, who was believed to be armed, allegedly kept a two-year-old as a hostage. Cuny is not believed to have known the child or had any form of relationship with anyone in the house where he fled. Roads around the property were blocked off and the neighborhood was put on lock down as negotiations began with Cuny, who police described as 'uncooperative'. Rapid City police updated residents about the siege on Twitter, with tweets including: 'Suspect refusing to come out, has small child in the residence with him. Police believe suspect is armed.' Standoff: Armed officers patrol the streets around the house as police try to negotiate with the kidnapper . Ordeal: Officers gather outside the home of a two-year-old boy who was taken hostage when a man fleeing from police rushed into the property . Armored cars and SWAT teams were seen moving into the streets around the house, and officers moved vehicles and pulled up fences to clear the way as they prepared to storm the house. Officers in an armored vehicle that had been parked in the middle of the street used a loud speaker to try to communicate with the suspect, calling for him to give himself up. At about 10.30pm armed police stormed the house, using door breach rounds and distraction techniques to rush in and grab the child. Police chief Karl Jegeris gave details of the rescue on social media, tweeting: 'Baby rescued and safe. Suspect in custody. All officers and deputies are safe.' Concerns: Police tweeted updates on the hostage situation on Tuesday . Relief: After a tense six hours police chief Karl Jegeris announced that the toddler had been rescued and the suspect arrested . He told Rapid City Journal: 'There were a lot of intense moments tonight. We are extremely thankful that the child is safe and has been returned to his mother.' The boy was said to have been physically unharmed and has been reunited with his family. In a statement, Police Chief Jegeris said: 'I am extremely proud of the Special Response Team and their . heroic efforts.' Cuny has been charged with kidnapping, burglary and two warrants. Police said further charges were expected.","Neighborhood was put on lock down as armed police surround house .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A Polish drunk sleeping on the street escaped death when a car ran over his head. Jarek Sawickio, 25, had nodded off outside an off-licence in Myslowice when the car rolled over his head, but left him with only 'minor abrasions'. He had reportedly lay down to sleep outside the shop at around 5pm after being refused service because he had drunk too much. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Jarek Sawickio, 25, was caught on camera sleeping outside an off-licence in Myslowice, southern Poland. A car, left, can be seen rolling backwards towards him, bumping over his head (centre), then coming to rest with him trapped underneath. Miraculously, police confirmed that he was not seriously hurt . So he had no way of noticing when a car starting reversing towards him, looking to park up by the shop. CCTV footage of the incident shows the car rolling slowly towards Mr Sawicikio, before bumping over his head. The unfortunate victim's legs can be seen jerking upwards as the force of the impact wakes him. Luckily, the car - an unidentified Opel model - comes to a rest with its wheels back on the ground. The driver tries to open the door after realising he has hit something before the footage, recorded on June 9 this year, cuts out. Bizarrely, a witness saunters by as the incident unfolds, seemingly unconcerned by the victim, who remains stuck under the car. Mr Sawicikio had reportedly been drinking with friends before the incident, and headed to the off-licence to buy more alcohol but was told 'I think you have had quite enough' by a shop attendant. Police in Poland confirmed his improbable survival, and said that he had only been very slightly hurt. Spokesman David Szlachetka said: 'The driver didn’t see him lying down and he was very lucky not to have been killed. 'Fortunately for him, he escaped with just light abrasions.' Mr Sawickio was taken to hospital where he was kept overnight for observation. He later said: 'Perhaps it is my guardian angel telling me to slow down on the hard stuff.'","Jarek Sawickio, 25, had nodded off in the street in Myslowice, Poland .

"By . Martin Robinson . Secret millionaire: Pensioner Iain Russell hid his wealth from family and friends and left £1.2m to charity in his will . A pensioner who lived in a £70,000 council house for most of his life has been revealed as a secret millionaire after he gifted his huge fortune to charities in his will. Iain Russell, 76, spent 40 years in the Merchant Navy and squirrelled away his pay, building up £1.2million in cash. He lived with his wife Irene in Lanarkshire who died two years ago but he then suffered a brain haemorrhage and died in October last year. But his friends and family have been left shocked after it was revealed he had £550,000 in bank accounts, £450,000 in cash and stocks, and even £144,000 in a bank on the Isle of Man. Mr Russell left £62,000 to friends and family but ordered the rest of his money be shared by four charities, who will receive around £290,000 each. Diabetes Scotland, MacKenzie Fund for Heart Cardiology, the Guild of Benevolence of the Institute of Marine Engineering and the Royal National Institute for the Blind(RNIB) will all receive windfalls. Iain served in the Army but spent most of his career at sea and working on the River Clyde as a member of a tug boat crew. He lived a modest life and friends have insisted he did not know how much he was worth. Close colleague, Thomas MacDonald, 72, served alongside Iain in the Merchant Navy. Mr MacDonald, of Forth, Lanarkshire, said: 'We both served our time together in Morton machine company in Wishaw then Iain was taken to the Army. 'He joined the Merchant Navy in the 1970s and became chief engineer. He stayed in the Navy for 40 years. 'I was totally surprised at the amount Iain left. We were like brothers, probably even closer, and we used to discuss finances and what we would do with any money we had. 'I knew his uncle had died and left him some money and shares but I've no idea how much. 'I'm quite sure Iain was unaware, I don't think he ever knew what was there.' Thomas also revealed Iain refused to pay for private health care even when he fell seriously ill. He added: 'He stayed down in Salford latterly because he was getting treated for a brain haemorrhage. 'I pleaded with him to go and pay for the operation privately but he wouldn't do it.' Humble: Mr Russell lived in this council house in Shotts, Lanarkshire, and spent 40 years in the merchant navy . A neighbour said: 'He was a very quiet man who kept himself to himself but he was very pleasant when you met him in the street. £550,000 in bank accounts . £450,000 in cash and stocks . £144,000 on the Isle of Man. 'It has come as a massive surprise to us that he had so much money, nobody could ever have imagined he was a millionaire.' Iain had been a lifelong member of the Institute of Marine Engineering and they paid tribute to his kindness. A spokeswoman said: 'Mr Russell had been a member of the Institute and a supporter of the Guild for more than 40 years. 'The Trustees greatly appreciate being one of the four charities to benefit from the residue of Mr Russell's estate.' A Diabetes Scotland spokesman said: 'We are incredibly grateful for people like the late Mr Russell who remember the work of our charity with a gift in their will. 'These gifts are vital for helping us make a big difference to the lives of people with diabetes or those at risk of developing the condition.' An RNIB Scotland spokesman added: 'RNIB very much depends on the generosity of the public to help us help blind and partially people, and to work to tackle preventable sight loss.'","Iain Russell has left £290,000 each in his will to four charities he supported .

Travelers on Interstate-77 in Cornelius, North Carolina traveling southbound off ramp towards exit 28 were surprised to see the word 'noly' instead of 'only' which is what the right turn lane is supposed to read. The product of what may have been rushed work during an over-the-weekend construction project is leaving drivers both amused and confused. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Interstate 77 in North Carolina has the word 'noly' written on it instead 'only' The popular Interstate road read 'noly' in white permanent paint next to the correctly spelled word, 'only' on the left. WBTV spoke with Cornelius Project manager Tyler Beardsley who blamed the misspelling on the project being completed before its due date. 'I think the contractor was just in a rush to get the bridge open as fast as possible and got a little careless,' said Beardsley to the TV station. The job was meant to take 32 hours but took 18 hours instead, almost half of the time it was supposed to take. Crews were meant to fix the road Monday night at no cost to tax payers.

"By . Associated Press . A man high on opiates fell asleep on a motel couch while smoking a cigarette, touching off the March fire that killed him and three others, authorities said Wednesday. Prosecutors released their final report into the March 21 blaze at the Mariner's Cove Motel in Point Pleasant Beach, where those displaced included many people who had been left homeless by Superstorm Sandy a year and a half earlier. Surveillance video from inside the motel shows John Alberti rummaging through seat cushions in a lounge. He later is shown face down on the couch with a lit cigarette. Scroll down for video . Spark: Prosecutors released their final report on the Mariner's Cove Motel fire that killed four last March. Included in the report was surveillance footage that showed tenant John Alberti, high on drugs, falling asleep with a lit cigarette on a lounge chair . Ignite: Alberti is seen leaving the lounge after having dropped the cigarette on a lounge chair . Ignite: Alberti is seen leaving the lounge after having dropped the cigarette on a lounge chair . An autopsy found the presence of opiates in his system, and Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato listed the cause as 'the impaired actions and careless use of smoking materials' by the 45-year-old man, who was a longtime resident of the motel two blocks from the beach. The video shows him sleeping face-down on the couch with the glowing tip of the cigarette no longer visible. He then rouses himself, slapping himself in the face over and over again before getting up. Smoke and flames erupted about 90 minutes later from the same corner of the couch where Alberti's cigarette had been. Dangerous: Smoke and flames overtake the room while the motel residents sleep, totally unaware . Outside: Surveillance footage outside the motel shows the quick spread of the flames . Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said uninterrupted video from the lounge area showed that no one else entered or left the room after Alberti exited. Authorities previously said a cigarette discarded in a chair touched off the fire, which was declared accidental, but did not say who caused the fire or under what circumstances. The video was retrieved from a badly damaged surveillance system and analyzed by the prosecutor's High Tech Crime Unit. The camera that filmed the start of the fire and its rapid spread was eventually consumed by the flames. Before: Three people were killed in the blaze. Above, what the Mariner's Cove Motel looked like before it burnt down . After: Some of the people staying in the hotel at the time were displaced from Superstorm Sandy . The probe also found the motel had working smoke detectors in each room, and that it complied with all housing, building and fire codes. In addition to Alberti, whose permanent address was in Keansburg, the fire also killed 20-year-old Paulo Martins, of South River; 52-year-old Harold Ford, of Neptune; and 66-year-old Albert Sutton, of Mount Laurel. Autopsies by the Ocean County Medical Examiner's Office determined that all four died from smoke inhalation. One of the guests who escaped the fire, who had lost his home in Superstorm Sandy, estimated that of the 40 people staying at the motel when the fire broke out, slightly more than half were either displaced Sandy victims or contractors drawn to the area by the region's bustling post-storm construction industry.

"By . Australian Associated Press . Gemahl Maika, 38, was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds on the front lawn of his home in Glen Alpine, south-west Sydney . A former Australian boxing champion, a self-described 'hitman' and the wife of a crime kingpin have been caught up in the alleged murder of a crown witness. They are among five people being linked by police to the three-year-old murder of Gemahl Maika, gunned down outside his home in Sydney's southwest. Mr Maika, 38, was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds on the front lawn of his house in Glen Alpine about 9.40pm on April 6, 2011. The 'execution', police say, was due to Mr Maika's status as a crown witness in a multimillion-dollar cocaine ring case. He was the chief witness in the NSW Police Force's Operation Schoale investigation, which saw the police seize hundreds of kilograms of cocaine, $20 million in cash, and firearms including a gold-plated handgun. After Mr Maika gave statements to police about the racket, he was killed in an alleged contract hit, and police say the 38-year-old declined offers for witness protection. Strike force officers took down the highly-lucrative Golden Gun syndicate in a series of dramatic raids in 2007, discovering its key players living the high life. Underworld figure Luke Sparos, 33, was charged with Gemahl Maika's murder on Thursday after his arrest on Wednesday in Wiley Park . Following three years of detective work, a series of stings over Wednesday and Thursday led to the arrest of five people in relation to Mr Maika's murder. Two of the five involved are Maxamillian Mazzilli, 33, from Tweed Heads who allegedly carried out the hit, and former champion kick boxer Adam Keith Watt, 46, charged with accessory before the fact after he allegedly sourced the gun. Police also arrested underworld king pin Luke Sparos, 33, and charged him with murder after he allegedly tasked people to source a gun while in jail, and Anthony Saliba, 29, charged with accessory before the fact and murder, who is the brother of Sparos's wife and accused of sourcing gun for Sparos. The final player is said to be Christine Saliba, 34, charged with accessory before the fact after she was allegedly tasked by husband Sparos to source gun. Alleged trigger man, Maxamillian Mazzilli, is accused of collecting $200,000 to carry out the hit. Parramatta Local Court heard on Thursday Mazzilli had told an undercover police officer he was a 'hitman' and Mr Maika had 'snitched on things he shouldn't have snitched on'. His lawyer Paul McGirr claimed there was no forensic evidence linking his client to Mr Marika's Glen Alpine home on the day of the alleged murder. However, prosecutor William Jarboue said Mazzilli knew 'minute details' of the death that were outside the reach of a Google search. He was arrested along with a 29-year-old man and a 46-year-old man over the alleged murder of Gemahl Maika, 38, who was found dead with a number of gunshot wounds on the front lawn of his home in Glen Alpine . This gold-plated handgun found when police busted the cocaine syndicate . Among the incriminating information logged in the undercover operation, the court heard, was Mazzilli knowing Mr Maika's family were inside the home when he was shot. Meanwhile, underworld figure Luke Sparos, 33, was charged with Maika's murder on Thursday after his arrest on Wednesday in Wiley Park. Sparos, who was due to appear in Lithgow Local Court, was an integral figure in the Golden Gun syndicate. He allegedly tasked his wife Christine Saliba to source a gun while he was in jail, a Sydney court heard. Anthony Saliba, 29, who is also accused of sourcing a gun and murder, sobbed when he appeared in court on Thursday. He was also arrested on Wednesday. The syndicate is believed to have imported about 700kg of cocaine from Los Angeles, which they sold to dealers for $133 million. But the drugs had a potential street value of around $700 million. His lawyer Abigail Bannister said Saliba, a hard working handyman with three jobs, was pulled into Sparos' scheme. Mr Maika was a witness in relation to Operation Schoale, a NSW Police Force investigation into a multi-million-dollar cocaine supply syndicate . Former world and Australian kick boxing champion Adam Keith Watt is accused of meeting Sparos in Long Bay jail in January 2011 and discussing sourcing a weapon. The court heard he allegedly told Sparos 'I got a 22 for $5000'. Watt was hit over the head with a sandwich maker by a jail inmate in 2009 and suffered a serious brain injury. His lawyer John Korn said the prosecution case was weak and his client was not involved in the shooting. Watt and Saliba were granted bail but will remain behind bars at least until a prosecution appeal against the decision is heard. Alleged gunman Mazzilli was refused bail. In 2011, detectives described Mr Maika's killing as a 'gruesome execution'. The Commander of the Homicide Squad, Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, commended Strike Force Hedgegrow detectives for their work and urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers. The investigation by Strike Force Hedgegrow continues and more arrests are expected, police said. All three arrested men have been refused bail and appeared in Parramatta Local Court on Thursday .

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Gordon Brown has called for British forces to be deployed to Nigeria to help rescue the 200 missing schoolgirls . Gordon Brown has called for British forces to be deployed to Nigeria to aid the rescue of more than 200 schoolgirls being held captive by Islamic militants. The former Prime Minister told MPs last night the failure to rescue the girls, who were kidnapped by the terrorist group Boko Haram two months ago, demanded an ‘international and domestic response’. ‘We have to do more to help the Nigerian government secure the rescue of the girls,’ he said. ‘While it is right to recognise there has been a great deal of international support, it is also right to acknowledge that in its hour of need, Nigeria does require more helicopter support, more aircraft cover, more surveillance equipment.’ He added that Britain should support president Goodluck Jonathan’s call for better intelligence sharing and if necessary ‘Special Forces and law enforcement agencies to help them confront terrorism’. Britain and several African countries have already established an intelligence unit to help the Nigerian authorities. Britain was one of the first countries to join the hunt for the 12 to 18-year olds, abducted from their boarding school in Chibok in the lawless northern Borno region. It was described by William Hague as a ‘disgusting and immoral’ act. Military chiefs had considered sending in the Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service to help search. The Special Forces’ director was reported to have told the Foreign Office in May that UK personnel could support the Nigerian armed forces with drones, intelligence, military planning or even join a rescue. The Nigerian schoolgirls were kidnapped by terrorist group, Boko Haram, which is led by Abubakar Shekau, seen here in a video released soon after the abductions . But it was understood top brass were . reluctant to take part in a raid after the botched SBS mission in which . British construction worker Chris McManus, 28, was executed by his . Nigerian kidnappers in March 2012. Mr Brown, who is now an UN envoy as well as an MP, said there were . thousands of other victims of the abduction – the children in the region . who can no longer attend school for their own safety. He said the news . that another 90 children had been kidnapped last month had been greeted . with just a ‘flicker of interest’. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it did not comment on Special Forces.","Said failure to rescue girls needed an 'international and domestic response'

The chocolate chip cookie is also lower in fat, sugar and calories than usual. Despite this, it is claimed taste isn’t compromised – and the fact that they have sold out three times in the past month seems to bear testament to this. Baked in Wales for specialist food website MuscleFood, the biscuits weigh a whopping 77g. Some 40g of this – or more than half of it – is made up of soy, milk and other proteins, following research suggesting that the nutrient is especially good at keeping hunger pangs at bay. Fat is reduced by using cocoa powder rather than milk chocolate and an artificial sweetener helps keep the amount of sugar used to under a teaspoon per cookie. However, they don’t come cheap, at £19.95 for a box of ten – or almost £2 each. Darren Beale, of MuscleFood.com said: ‘We’re a nation of biscuit lovers but we have become far more conscious about what put into our bodies. ‘We were determined to create a product that could stand up to leading High Street brands in terms of taste and texture but with greater nutritional benefits. ‘These cookies will complement hard work in the gym and efforts to shed pounds.’ Frankie Phillips, a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, agreed that studies have shown protein to be particularly satisfying. However, despite the efforts made, the cookies are still high in fat and calories, with a single cookie containing as many calories as a dieter’s entire lunch. Scroll down for video .

She said: ‘For my money, I’d rather people went for a low-fat yoghurt and a sandwich.’ Mike Lean, professor of human nutrition at Glasgow University, described the protein content as ‘huge’. He said: ‘That is very remote from the type of food which humans evolved to eat, and very high protein foods put the kidneys under pressure - in rare cases resulting in serious renal failure.  So I would not want to eat this type of cookie.’","The treat baked for website MuscleFood.com, is designed for slimmers .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Awkward: NFL commentator and Hall of Famer Warren Sapp found himself at the center of a controversy after he failed to leave a tip for a waitress in Florida citing bad service . NFL Hall of Famer Warren Sapp has come under fire for stiffing a waitress at a Florida sports bar Tuesday - but the former player insists he didn't tip the server only because the service was terrible. The kerfuffle over Sapp's tipping habits erupted after a photo of his receipt from Upper Deck Ale and Sports Grille in Hallandale with a '0' scrawled where the tip was supposed to go went viral on social media. To add insult to injury, the famed defensive tackle scrawled across the printout: 'Boys don't tip.' On his Twitter page Wednesday, Mr Sapp defended his actions, writing that he decided to withhold gratuity on his bill totaling just under $70 because his server repeatedly called him and his companion 'boys.' 'No waitress will ever call me a boy twice after the 1st time & I say to her ""when u look at me do u see a boy?"" #HenceBoysDontTip' he tweeted to his 1.09million followers. Sapp, 41, an analyst for NFL Network, headed to Upper Deck bar in Hallandale Tuesday afternoon to watch the epic World Cup match between Team USA and Belgium. The 6-foot-2, 300-pound Hall of Famer and a friend ordered a pizza, a Reuben sandwich, a platter of wings, a bowl of crab soup and a bucket of beer, which came out to be $69.39. Scroll down for video . Written proff: ESPN's Darren Rovell obtained Sapp's $69.39 bill from Upper Deck Ale and Sports Grille featuring Sapp's message to a server named Corey . In his own words: Sapp tweeted to his followers that he became upset after the server repeatedly called him a boy . Sapp was supposed to leave a minimum of $10.40, but the waitress named Corey came away from the transaction empty-handed. According to the stamp on the receipt, Sapp asked for the check at 3.20pm, about 40 minutes before the start of the game. He later explained on Twitter that he took off early because the 'service was worst.' On Wednesday, the waitress spoke out for the first time since the tip-gate, offering her side of the story. Corey D'Agata, 26, told radio host Andy Slater at 940 WINZ in Miami that she did nothing to offend the legendary football player, Larry Brown Sports reported. ‘We were busy. I walked over to his table. It was him and one other guy and I just said, “Hey, boys, what can I get you to drink?” and he stopped me right there,’ D’Agata recounted. ‘He said, “We’re not boys, I’m a man.” So then I called him “sugar” and “honey.”’ Game day lunch: Sapp and a friend headed to the Hallandale sports bar to watch the World Cup match between the U.s. and Belgium and get a bite to eat . The bar worker said that she was not aware that the term ‘boys’ could be seen as offensive by someone, adding that when she serves female patrons she usually addresses them as ‘girls’ or ‘ladies.’ D'Agata has challenged Sapp’s assertion that the service at the eatery was so bad that he was forced to leave, telling the radio host that he stayed at the bar for the game and took off about an hour after Belgium beat the U.S.2-1. Addressing the matter of the leaked receipt, the 26-year-old blamed her sister for sharing a snapshot of the bill she had sent to her in private on Facebook, where it spread like wildfire before it became a viral hit on Twitter thanks to ESPN's Darren Rovell. He said, she said: The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle insisted that the service at the bar was bad, but the waitress, Corey D'Agata disputed his claims, saying that he did not have a word of complaint . Twitter users were split in their reaction to Sapp's decision to take a stand over the waitress' use of the term 'boys,' with some defending his tight-fisted move while others calling him out for stiffing the server. Shaun King, Sapp’s former teammate on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, told TMZ Sports that the 41-year-old analyst is an excellent tipper so long as the service is good. Meanwhile, Corey D'Agata’s manager at Upper Deck told TMZ Wednesday that the employee will be reprimanded, but he would not say if she stands to lose her job over the incident.","Sapp, 41, withheld gratuity on $69.39 bill at Upper Deck Ale and Sports Grille in Hallandale, Florida, during U.S.-Belgium World Cup match .

"By . Lucy Crossley . An X factor contestant got through the audition stages of X Factor, despite being on police bail over an alleged rape, it is claimed. The 24-year-old singer songwriter reportedly auditioned for Simon Cowell and his fellow judges, Mel B, Cheryl Cole and Louis Walsh, before making it through to the next round. However, the panel were unaware that the would-be star was the subject of a police investigation, having been arrested and questioned by detectives. The contestant has now been dropped from the show for after he failed to declare the incident, and his appearance will not be broadcast on television . A 24-year-old singer songwriter reportedly auditioned for Louis Walsh, Mel B, Cheryl Cole and Simon Cowell while on police bail over an alleged rape . The rape is alleged to have taken place last year, and it is understood that the singer denies all of the accusations. Police have not charged him in connection with the alleged sex attack, and according to The Sun, he will learn later this month if any further action is to be taken against him. A friend said he had decided to try his hand at the TV talent search due to his admiration of Cole, who returned to the panel for its 11th series after leaving the show in 2010. She took up a place on the U.S. version, but was fired by Cowell - after just one episode, reportedly over fears that American viewers would struggle to understand her Newcastle accent. 'He was naive to think this wouldn't become an issue,' the wannabe's friend told The Sun's Emma Brankin. The singer is reportedly cooperating with police over the matter, after approaching them voluntarily. X Factor bosses have now decided to drop the contestant from the show entirely - his audition will not appear on TV, and he will not be allowed to proceed to the later rounds of the competition.

"By . Associated Press . Arthur strengthened to a hurricane early Thursday and threatened to give North Carolina a glancing blow on Independence Day, prompting the governor to warn vacationers along the coast not to risk their safety by trying to salvage their picnics and barbecues. Forecasters expect Arthur to whip past the state's Outer Banks on Friday without making landfall. One local remarked that he was more worried about his tomato plants than storm damage. But North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory warned: 'Don't put your stupid hat on.' The first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season prompted a hurricane warning for much of the North Carolina coast and a mandatory evacuation for visitors to the Outer Banks' Hatteras Island as of 5 a.m. Thursday. Residents also were advised to leave the island. A voluntary evacuation was announced for the Outer Banks' Ocracoke Island, accessible only by ferry. The islands are linked by North Carolina Route 12, which has been sliced apart twice in recent years as storms cut temporary channels from the ocean to the sound. Hatteras Island is particularly vulnerable to storm surge and flooding and the road is easily blocked by sand and water. Scroll down for video . In the patch: The Outer Banks of North Carolina are set to get hit with the brunt of Hurricane Arthur on Friday morning, but the storm will blow past New York Friday night with 85mph winds . Upgraded: Arthur was rated a Category I hurricane on Thursday morning after winds picked up to 75mph as it swirled off the coast of South Carolina . Fleeing: Vacationers and residents alike packed up and evacuated the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Wednesday in anticipation of Hurricane Arthur side-swiping the vulnerable barrier islands . In addition to the hurricane warning, tropical storm warnings were in effect for coastal areas in South Carolina and Virginia. Gary Reinhardt, 63, and his wife Lori, both of Sarasota, Florida, said they planned to exit low-lying Hatteras Island on Thursday morning. So were nearly two dozen other family members from California, Nebraska and Michigan. A long line of cars, trailers and recreational vehicles already formed a steady stream of traffic before sunset Wednesday. 'I'm worried about the road. It took way too long to get here,' said Gary Reinhardt, adding that the two-and-a-half-hour delay to get on the island came Sunday, when there was no hurricane threatening. Reinhardt worried their departure would take twice as long Thursday. Mike Rabe of Virginia Beach, Virginia, planned to stay in his beach home the entire weekend. He and his wife, Jan, arrived Wednesday at the house they bought two and a half years ago and set to work stowing lawn furniture and anything else that could be tossed about by hurricane winds. He said he was going to spend Thursday helping a friend and longtime resident prep his nearby water sports shop and campground for bad weather. 'I'm going to help him prepare and then I'm going to ride it out,' said Rabe, 53. Other areas of the Outer Banks were taking a cautious, but still-optimistic approach: No evacuations had been ordered for areas north of Hatteras, including the popular town of Kill Devil Hills, which was the site of the Wright brothers' first controlled, powered airplane flights in December 1903. Warnings: The entire North Carolina coast has been put on notice ahead of Hurricane Arthur . Farther north, the annual Boston Pops Fourth of July concert and fireworks show was moved up a day because of potential heavy rain ahead of Hurricane Arthur. Organizers and public safety officials said the celebration was being rescheduled for Thursday, which appeared to be the best of two potential bad weather days. The holiday weekend was not expected to be a complete loss for the estimated quarter-million visitors vacationing on the Outer Banks. Forecasters said the storm would move through quickly with the worst of the weather near Cape Hatteras about dawn Friday. Then it was expected to clear. In the Myrtle Beach area, the heart of South Carolina's $18 billion tourism industry, Arthur was expected to move by Thursday night, spinning wind gusts from 40 to 50 mph toward the high-rise hotels and condominiums lining the oceanfront. Early Thursday, Arthur was about 340 miles southwest of Cape Hatteras and moving north around 9 mph with maximum sustained winds of 75mph. Rough surf brought great surfing to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Stephen Hunter Hicks is see surfing off Cape Hatteras on Wednesday . Scars: The Hatteras Pier is still broken after it was battered in previous hurricanes . The National Hurricane Center predicted Arthur would swipe the coast early Friday with winds of up to 85mph. The storm would be off the coast of New England later Friday and eventually make landfall in Canada's maritime provinces as a tropical storm, the Hurricane Center predicted. 'Although the current forecast doesn't indicate this will be a major impact, we are taking it very seriously,' McCrory said. 'I don't want you to put at risk not only yourself but also people who may try to help you.' He signed executive orders declaring a state of emergency for 25 counties and one that waives regulations allowing faster restoration of power and debris removal. Generators, lanterns and flashlights, water and other supplies were snapped up in stores on the Outer Banks on Wednesday. Danny Couch of Buxton, who owns and operates a company that offers bus tours of Hatteras and Ocracoke islands, said local businesses have a narrow window to make their money each year. 'We've got that 15-week stretch between Memorial Day and Labor Day, and every week counts. ... The local business community holds its breath as Labor Day approaches but now we're holding our breath for July 4th,' he said. 'These stumbling blocks come up in front of us that have to be surmounted.' But Bill Motley, who works at Ace Hardware in Nags Head and has lived on the Outer Banks for 13 years was not too concerned about storm damage. 'I'm more worried about my tomato plants. With the wind coming, if we get a 50mph gust, it will knock over my tomato plants,' he said.

Police papers allegedly show calls had been made between the 26-year-old American and a drug dealer in the days before and after the murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox has vowed she would never 'willingly' return to Italy, where she and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were reconvicted earlier this year of the killing of 21-year-old Miss Kercher. Both Knox and Sollecito are appealing the verdict. Scroll down for video .

Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, for the murder of Kercher in Perugia and served four years before being released on appeal in 2011. On January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering Miss Kercher - a ruling the pair are again appealing.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Politicians in Austria, Denmark and Norway are considering banning the burka in public after the European Court of Human Rights upheld French laws . Politicians in Austria are set to introduce a motion to ban burkas after the European Court of Human Rights upheld French rules barring people from covering their face in public. Members of Austria's Freedom Party could put the motion before parliament as early as next week, while MPs from the Danish People's Party and Norway's Labour and Progress parties are considering similar plans. On Tuesday the ECHR ruled that a French ban on wearing full-face veils in public did not breach human rights as it didn't specifically target Muslims. Members of Austria's Freedom Party added that there was no compulsion in Islam to wear a full-face veil, and so any ban would not constitute an attack on religious freedoms. Freedom Party spokeswoman Carmen Gartelgruber told The Local that in the 'wide, conservative circles of Islamic immigration society', the opinion prevails that women are second-class citizens. One of the many instruments for oppressing women is the burka, she added. In Denmark a ban was last discussed between 2009 and 2010 but was quickly shot down in the belief that the European Court would rule against it. But now Martin Henriksen, a member of the anti-immigration People's Party, says the legal framework for a ban has been laid down. He told Politiken: '[A ban] would send the signal that we do not accept parallel societies and isolation. We see [the burka] as a rejection of Danish society. 'It is a sign that one wishes to distance themselves from the rest of society.' Meanwhile the Labour and Progress parties in Norway welcomed the ban, and suggested they may also raise the issue again. Former Labour Party leader Thorbjørn Jagland said the judgement was positive, and recognised that hiding behind a veil meant other members of your community struggled to relate to you. On Tuesday judges at the ECHR (pictured) ruled that a French ban on full-face veils in public didn't breach human rights as it wasn't targeted specifically at Muslims and posed a barrier to social cohesion . A law banning full-face veils was rejected by the country's parliament just last year over concerns the ECHR would reject it. But despite the new ruling, politicians in Norway admit that any new proposition is unlikely to pass as public opinion seems to be against such a law. France's parliament passed a burka ban in 2010, leading to protests from Islamic groups who said it was discriminatory. However on Tuesday judges said that the measure aimed at stopping women covering their faces in public was entirely justified. They said that the right of ordinary people to 'live together' was a 'legitimate objective', and that Muslim women wearing face coverings threatened it. Belgium and parts of Switzerland have also introduced bans, and similar ones are being considered in Italy and Holland. Plans for one in Britain have also been mooted by backbench MPs and other politicians, including members of the UK Independence Party.","European Court of Human Rights ruled French ban on full-face veils legal .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Associated Press . Oscar Pistorius’ natural response to the intruder he believed had broken into his home the night he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp would be to fire his gun, rather than flee, according to an expert. Speaking for the defence on day 37 of the Paralympian’s murder trial in Pretoria, Wayne Derman, a professor of sport and exercise at the University of Cape Town, said that for Oscar Pistorius ‘to flee is not an option because the individual does not have lower legs’. Derman added that Pistorius is a 'paradox' whose racing triumphs contrast sharply with the severe limitations of his disability. He said the contrast likely contributed to stress and anxiety for Pistorius. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'Fight, not flee': Oscar Pistorius has no option to escape in the face of danger because of his disability, an expert at the Paralympian's murder trial said . Distracted: Pistorius uses a phone as he sits in the dock . Professor Derman, who has treated Pistorius, told the trial on Thursday that thinking stops when 'flight or fight' kicks in, and that his patient is always more likely to fight, because of his ‘significant disability’. Pistorius maintains that when he fired his gun through the bathroom door of his home on February 14, 2013, killing Steenkamp, he thought he was shooting an intruder. He previously told the trial: ‘I was not thinking - I just fired.’ Professor Derman told the court he found Pistorius to be 'hyper-vigilant' and was restless, often looking around quickly and scanning for possible threats. 'He is an anxious individual,' Derman said. He also noted that Pistorius has a hand tremor as well as a sleep disorder that required medication. The defense wants to show that the athlete had a deep sense of vulnerability and it was a factor in the 'mistaken shooting'. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel during cross-examination argued that Derman's testimony is likely to be biased because as a physician he is obligated to 'act in the best interests of his patients'. Derman countered that he has backed up all his points with scientific facts. 'The truth would come before my patient,' Derman said. Nel said: 'You cannot give evidence against your patient, sir.' He went on to claim that Derman was giving 'character evidence' rather than 'expert evidence'. He suggested on Thursday that Pistorius acted methodically on the night he killed Steenkamp because he had to locate his gun, which was not where he normally kept it, then take the weapon out of its holster and then move down a passage from the bedroom to the bathroom while scanning for the perceived threat. 'The accused was careful before he entered the passage,' Nel said. The trial heard earlier that Oscar Pistorius does not display the narcissism associated with men in abusive relationships and linked to 'rage-type' murders, according to a psychologist's report. The report adds to conflicting evidence about the character of the double-amputee runner. Preparation: Oscar Pistorius has his tie adjusted by his uncle Arnold Pistorius, right, in court during his ongoing murder trial in Pretoria on Thursday . Kenny Oldwage, one of the defence lawyers of  South African paralympian Oscar Pistorius, gestures as he speaks during his client's murder trial at the High Court in Pretoria . The defense has sought to support Pistorius' contention that he killed the 29-year-old model by mistake, fearing an intruder was about to attack him; the prosecution says the Paralympian is a jealous egotist who shot Steenkamp after a Valentine's Day argument. Dr. Jonathan Scholtz, a clinical psychologist, found no evidence that Pistorius had a history of 'abnormal aggression or explosive violence' but concluded he has a record of feeling insecure and vulnerable, particularly when he is without his prosthetic limbs, defense lawyer Barry Roux said. He read excerpts from the psychological report, part of a court-ordered evaluation of Pistorius' state of mind over 30 days at a state psychiatric hospital. The evaluation, which included a separate report by three psychiatrists, said Pistorius was not mentally ill when he killed Steenkamp. That conclusion appeared to remove the possibility that Pistorius could be declared not guilty by reason of mental illness. On Wednesday, his defense team tried to show that the psychologist's report supports the Paralympian's account of a mistaken shooting because his disability and purported fear of crime contributed to a heightened sense of vulnerability. Trial: A supporter hugs Oscar Pistorius on Wednesday at the court in Pretoria . When physically threatened, Pistorius might have a fearful reaction that could 'seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of an able-bodied person, but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history,' said Roux, quoting from the report. The lawyer also cited the psychologist as saying Pistorius has become severely traumatized since the killing and will become an increasing suicide risk unless he continues to get mental health care. At times during his trial, Pistorius has wailed and retched in apparent distress, particularly during graphic testimony about the shooting and also when the athlete was on the witness stand. At other times, he has been calm and taken notes. Nel has suggested Pistorius feigned distress in order to dodge a tough cross-examination; the athlete's camp has denied his emotional displays were fake. Nel has portrayed Pistorius as a reckless narcissist with a penchant for gunplay and driving at high speeds. He has highlighted arguments between the runner and Steenkamp in the weeks before he killed her, though the defense has said most of their communication was normal and affectionate. Pistorius, who is free on bail, faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder, but he could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing. Additionally, he faces separate gun-related charges.","Pistorius 'always more likely to fight than flee', says expert at murder trial .

"By . Dan Bloom . A rare set of original prints has cast light on soldiers' everyday life in the First World War 100 years after fighting began. The 70 images, taken by press and army photographers on the Western Front, were used as positive propaganda back home - but rarely for war material of the time, most were not posed or staged. Instead they showed the everyday activities of soldiers in the harsh conditions of the trenches, including servicemen attaching a message to a collie dog which would have been used to deliver messages through No Man's Land. Poignant: A rare set of original prints has cast light on soldiers' everyday life in the First World War 100 years after fighting began. In one, soldiers attach a message to a collie dog which would then be sent through No Man's Land. They would not have been spared by German snipers, but were small and quick enough to avoid them . The first mechanised war: The photos depict everyday scenes near the Western front, including hundreds of 2ft artillery shells lined up neatly ready for battle . Bleak: The photographs were used as propaganda to encourage more men to enlist in the army back in Britain, but unlike many, they were not staged or posed . Muddy: Another one of the photographs showed mules being used to pull horses out of a bog after they became stuck. Conditions in winter were harsh . Dogs were used not because the enemy would spare them - they would have been shot dead like everyone else - but because they were small and quick enough to avoid snipers' bullets. Among them are images of troops braving the freezing winter months in their fortified trenches at stations in France and Belgium soon after war broke out in summer 1914. One shot shows a ‘shell dump’, where 2ft tall artillery shells were stored in their hundreds, while another shows soldiers manning rudimentary machine gun posts. In another, a Tommy loads a rocket onto a wooden launching pole which would then be fired to announce to impending attacks. Some were not so positive: a particularly grim shot shows mules pulling horses from a muddy bog in which they had become stuck. Convenient: British foot soldiers pass through a hole in a wall, which handily has been blasted out for them by a previous shell. Few cameras were on the front line . No peace on the horizon: Soldiers using range-finding techniques. The 70 photographs are original prints which would have been made from glass negatives . Everyday work of war: Soldiers reinforcing a trench (left) and hanging telegraph wires from a tree branch (right). Communication was everything in the high-tech war . Remains: The wreckage of a German field gun. What the images do not capture is the unprecedented violence of the world's first fully mechanised war . Just like home: Key trenches were wide enough to take horses and carts, and soldiers would add the names of London streets to make them more familiar . Some of the images carry a ‘press’ stamp on the back, and experts - who expect the collection to sell for £3,000 at an auction next week - say the rest were likely to have been taken by official army photographers. Although they were seen at the time, as part of a recruitment drive to show troops 'enjoying' life in the trenches, many have not been seen in years since and some may never have been seen publicly at all. The prints were made from original glass negatives and are being sold in six lots by auctioneers Onslows next Wednesday in Blandford, Dorset. For 40 years they were owned by an anonymous memorabilia collector from Dorset who has amassed one of the country's finest collections of photographs, documents and medals from the Great War. Now in his mid-60s, the man - who is not a veteran - acquired the photographs in a single collection by advertising in the classified columns of newspapers and magazines, including the Daily Telegraph and Private Eye. Lunchtime! Soldiers eating rations. The comparatively primitive cameras of the day had trouble capturing quick movements due to their long exposure times . Bitter: Much of the fighting happened in the dead of winter, as evidenced by the starkly naked trees which line this procession of allied troops . Captured: A German gun emplacement. In the great battles of the First World War, advances of even a few feet were won at the cost of thousands of lives . Camp: Soldiers walk across an improvised bridge in freezing conditions. The owner of the photographs obtained them by placing classified newspaper adverts . Improvising: Soldiers had to do what they could in grim conditions - which included everyday chores. Here they dry their clothes on a bombed-out agricultural site . He decided to sell much of his collection in several sales by Onslows to mark the centenary of the outbreak of war. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'Photographs from World War One are very rare, especially those taken on the Western Front. These photos are being sold by a private collector who has spent the last 40 years compiling artefacts from the First World War. 'He bought these photos in a job lot of around 70 pieces. They are original copy prints which makes them incredibly rare. Some have been taken by press photographers and come with a stamp of the news organisation on the back. 'But others don’t have any stamp, which would suggest they were taken by the army’s own photographers. 'The point of the photographs was to portray the war in a good light and to convince more men to enlist. The few photos that were taken on the Western Front were often posed by the soldiers, but these are real life pictures which makes them all the more poignant.' Hard at work: A machine gun emplacement. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'Photographs from World War One are very rare, especially those taken on the Western Front' On the march: Not all the troops involved in fighting were British - here, soldiers from overseas saluted their own top brass during an event near the front line . Visitors: Many of the photographs, including this one, came with no captions, leaving their origins mysterious . Bleak: With waters almost down to freezing point, even the job of filling a Dixie can was an arduous one. The photographs tried to portray the war in a positive light . Unavoidable: Even though they were meant to be positive, the grim reality of war could not be evaded. Cart horses struggled and slipped in icy conditions, pictured .","The 70 rarely-seen original prints caught soldiers during their everyday lives and are expected to fetch £3,000 .

Peter Walsh, 68, was the first Australian and oldest person in the world to receive the hand transplant back in March 2011. Despite his new hand remaining numb for two months following the nine-hour operation, Mr Walsh said he had adapted well and could now write, feed himself, and attach his prosthetic limbs.

Things like that I still (need a hand with). 'I can put both my prosthetic legs on… the hardest I find is to put my socks on.' Doctors were forced to amputate both of Mr Walsh's hands and feet back in 2006 after he was struck down with pneumococcal sepsis, a bacterial infection that saw him placed in an induced coma.

So far the clip - which lasts for almost four minutes - of Tyson Williams performing the prank call has attracted more than 160,000 views. It involves Williams putting two Domino's Pizza employees on the phone to each other using the 'merge calls' function on his mobile phone. Scroll down for video . A video of a Brisbane man pranking two Domino's Pizza employees has gone viral . In the footage, the Brisbane man dials the number of Domino's Pizza in Forest Lake - south of the Queensland capital - on his iPhone. A pizza chain employee named 'Ron' greets him and prepares to take his pick-up order. Williams - whose friend is having trouble keeping his amused laughter at bay off-camera - orders two deep pan pepperoni pizzas, two thin 'n' crispy Hawaiian pizzas, two cheesy breads and a 1.25-litre bottle of coke under the name of 'Rogan'. At one point, it looks like Williams is about to break his facade and lose his composure, but he keeps it together and tells Ron to hold on - saying he has to ask his friend what dessert he wants to order. While Ron is on hold, Williams then dials the number of the Acacia Ridge branch - also in Brisbane's south - of Domino's Pizza. Tyson Williams posted the video on YouTube and so far it has had more than 160,000 views . Two employees - one from the Acacia Ridge store (pictured) and one from the Forest Lake store - were victims of the prank . A 'Rhiannon' answers the phone and asks him: 'Would you like pick-up or delivery?' Williams tells her to hold and proceeds to take Ron off hold, and asks him to read the order back - but not before Williams merges the calls so Rhiannon thinks Ron is the one placing the order. What ensues is a lot of confusion on the part of both employees who don't realise that neither is placing an order, but trying to take an order. This is where Williams and his friend really start to get a kick out of the prank - trying to stifle their laughter. In the footage, Williams and his friend cannot contain their delight at the prank . After the prank, Williams and his friend burst out laughing, and jump up and down with joy . After about two minutes, the employees finally figure out what is going on. 'So you haven't called me?' Rhiannon said. Ron confirmed that he didn't and then added: 'Sounds like someone is stuffing us around.' The video ends with the employees hanging up, and Williams and his friend finally being able to laugh out loud freely.","Brisbane's Tyson Williams has uploaded a four-minute video on YouTube .

He won approval for his choice of Valery Heletey as defense minister, replacing Mikhailo Koval, while Lieutenant General Viktor Muzhenko was appointed chief of the military's general staff. 'Today the revival of the army is starting from the scratch, the army which is capable of fighting and winning,' Poroshenko said in parliament.

Accusations of corruption have been rife as Kiev's operation against the rebels continues. Poroshenko's forceful words contrasted with his emphasis on starting a peace process voiced in his inaugural address June 7. He declared a unilateral cease-fire for 10 days in hopes rebels would lay down their arms and join talks. But the cease-fire was repeatedly violated and ultimately expired. Rebels in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where more Russian speakers live, have declared independence and occupied government buildings. The insurrection started after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from office by a protest movement among people wanting closer ties with the European Union instead of Russia. Russia called Yanukovych's ouster a coup by radical nationalists and seized Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea region. Ukraine says Russia is now backing the insurgency.

"By . Alex Greig . A 27-year-old Florida woman is accused of killing her newborn baby girl in the shower after giving birth then hiding the infant's body in her bedroom inside a plastic bag. Maria Macdalena Castillo told detectives that she didn't know she was pregnant when she began giving birth in the shower in late April. Castillo was arrested Wednesday following confirmation from the state medical examiner that the baby was alive at birth. Manslaughter: Police say Maria Castillo gave birth in the shower then put the baby in a plastic trash bag and hid her under clothing in her bedroom . She is being held at the Hernando County Detention Center in lieu of $30,000 on a charge of aggravated manslaughter. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Castillo told detectives she became scared when she went into labor while showering on April 28 in the Brooksville apartment where she lives with her mother and adult siblings. She allegedly gave birth to the baby girl then put her in a trash bag which she concealed beneath some clothes in her bedroom. The child remained in the bag for about an hour before Castillo's brother went to the bathroom to take a shower and discovered what had happened. Grisly discovery: Family members discovered the baby in Castillo's bedroom and attempted to resuscitate her without success . Family members made Castillo open her door and entered the bedroom where they found the baby girl partially covered by clothing. Her brother began CPR, reports the Tampa Bay Times, while her mother called 911. The baby, which was at full-term, was pronounced dead at the scene after efforts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. Castillo's family told detectives that they were unaware that she was pregnant. The baby girl's cause of death was listed as asphyxiation, hemorrhage and inattention at birth. Neighbors told Bay News 9 that Castillo may have had been developmentally impaired. 'I was really shocked,' said Bertha Brown. 'I just really don't see her as knowing what actually happened.' Brown said she had often seen Castillo riding her bike in the neighborhood with a man around the same age. 'My heart goes out for her, because I don't think she was aware of the seriousness of really being pregnant,' said Brown.","Maria Castillo, 27, is accused of placing her newborn baby in a plastic trash-bag shortly after birth .

Ronnie and Donnie Galyon, the oldest living conjoined twins, will overtake the age of their heroes, Thai twins Chang and Eng Bunker, as they turn 62 years, eight months and seven days on Friday. The Bunker twins died in North Carolina in 1874 aged 62 years, eight months and six days. Then later this year, the duo from Beavercreek, Ohio hope to be recognized as the world's oldest ever conjoined twins as they reach their 63rd birthday.

The brothers, born October 28, 1951, are hoping to be recognized later this year as the world's oldest conjoined twins, when they turn 63 . Duo: Donnie, left, turns off a light. The twins have four arms and four legs between them . The Galyon twins, who are joined at the waist and face each other, are throwing a party Saturday to mark overtaking their heroes, Mlive reported. They . have four arms and four legs and separate hearts and stomachs but share . a lower digestive tract, a groin, a rectum and penis, over which Donnie . has control. The . twins were born healthy in Dayton, Ohio in October 1951 but stayed in . the hospital for two years as doctors tried to figure out how to . separate them. But when they said they could not guarantee both babies . would survive an operation to part them, the parents said they would . stay as they were. The men agree that was the best decision.

A family . friend contacted . the Christian Youth Corps, which helped accommodate the house for the . twins' needs, including a kitchen, wife hallways, oversized bathroom and . shower.

The bed is comprised of two backrests that face each other and let the men sit with their legs splayed out. It is far preferable to their days of sleeping on top of each other in a queen-sized bed, they said. The updated home has meant that their health has improved dramatically in the past four years, their brother said. He says they no longer need help getting up and moving around. He said that he and his wife love having his big brothers living with them. 'That's . kind of giving it back right now,' he said. 'I don't do it because of that, but I . feel that way. They paid for us all growing up.' Mary added: 'A . day doesn't go by that I don’t hear ""I love you"" and ""Thank you"". If you spend time around them, you can't help but love them.' Younger years: The Galyons are pictured in their family's Dayton, Ohio on their third birthday in October 1954, after their parents decided they would never be operated on . They sometimes fight but also enjoy going fishing together as well as heading to baseball games, fairs and restaurants, which they can access on their customized wheelchair, their brother said. While out and about, people often stare or approach them to ask questions, the men said. Some people have mocked them, but others have paid their restaurant bills and spoken kindly to them. 'You see the warmest of hearts, and you see the coldest of hearts, and a little bit in between,' Jim said. Conjoined twins occur once in every 200,000 live births and the survival rate is between five and 25 per cent.

Last year he appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair bound man who said he was possessed by the devil. The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism,' and it released a statement that said 'he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him.' The man later said that Francis had failed to banish the demons from his body. However, after Francis placed his hands on him, he was able to walk again, he claimed.

Joe Cole, once the next darling of English football, has admitted he was wrong to join Liverpool in 2010, but is happy with his career again at West Ham United and intends to see out the remainder of his career at Upton Park. Cole returned to his boyhood club for a second spell in January, after two-and-a-half forgettable years at Anfield. And - in an interview with Chelsea fanzine cfcuk - he concedes that he made a mistake in heading for Merseyside as a free agent after seeing his contract run down at Chelsea. Off and running: Cole has made an impact for West Ham since joining in January . Cole admitted he never adapted to life at Liverpool, and says he was given no choice but to make a move as he could not bring himself to turn out for Tottenham Hotspur, who offered him a five-year deal in the summer of 2011. 'I can only play for teams that I’m passionate about and I think that’s what went wrong for me at Liverpool,' said the 31-year-old midfielder. 'I didn’t feel a connection with the club or the place that I had at Chelsea and West Ham. 'I had seven great years at Chelsea but the club wanted to go in a certain direction and I wasn’t involved. So I was left with two real options - Liverpool or Spurs. Decline: Cole was once tipped to be an England star, but his last game for his country came in 2010 . 'Spurs was probably the best option because they were offering me a five-year deal and it meant I could stay in familiar surroundings. 'But I just couldn’t do it, I just couldn’t see myself pulling that Spurs shirt over my head. With the rivalry between Spurs and West Ham and Chelsea, it felt a bit mercenary. Cole appeared in just 26 league games for Liverpool, and was loaned out to French side Lille in an attempt to regain his form. But the 31-year-old, who has not played for England since 2010, has found his feet at West Ham under Sam Allardyce.

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger says this has been a 'dream summer' for the club, with the mass exodus actually helping them become stronger on and off the field. Following their best ever Premier League campaign, St Mary's witnessed an unparalleled and, at times, uncomfortable talent drain. The departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff to Tottenham was quickly followed by Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers moving on to pastures new. Adam Lallana was among those to leave Southampton in the summer when he joined Liverpool for £25m . The odds on Saints being relegated dramatically cut after those exits, although the club acted quickly to allay fears by appointing highly-regarded Ronald Koeman before bringing in eight new players. It is a case of so far so good for the new-look side, who head into Saturday's match with Newcastle on the back of a 3-1 win at West Ham and a transfer-window profit of more than £30million. 'We feel we're in a stronger position than we entered this crazy transfer window,' chairman Krueger said. 'If someone had told me in the middle of May that - after the outs, including the managerial team, and the ins - we would be standing here speaking about what we have, I would say that would be a dream summer. 'We've had amazing financial discipline throughout it all. We still have a lot of work to do in the club. We didn't do everything perfectly this summer. We are never going to say that. Luke Shaw moved to Manchester United for £31.5m after being in the England squad at World Cup . 'We know we have a lot of lessons to take out of our summer steps, but they will help us in the future, for sure.' Such positivity flies in the face of what some dubbed a 'meltdown' at St Mary's, where the summer exits only served to compound the January departure of divisive executive chairman Nicola Cortese. It is talk Krueger continues to laugh off, saying Southampton have always 'kept moving forwards' with a long-term view - one which gives them more strength in depth than before. 'There was a time in the summer where everybody would be thankful just for the team to be slightly competitive,' he said, speaking at club partner Sunseeker's stand at the Southampton Boat Show. 'I think we are more than slightly competitive now and we just have to stay patient. 'There are a lot of changes. There are eight new players from outside, five new from inside (promoted from the academy) - that's 13 players that need to be integrated. 'We've got a new management staff, so we're very patient. The potential of this group will not necessary show up in the next few weeks. Southampton have made a promising start to the season despite the summer exodus . 'Everybody around it needs to understand that all this change needs some time, let it be a one-off as far as the amount of change. 'We don't expect in the next transfer windows to come anywhere close to this kind of a situation again. 'We're doing everything possible to prevent that, which I think is comfort for those who I know went through sleepless nights - and, trust me, we did too.' The future of Jay Rodriguez and, in particular, Morgan Schneiderlin were the main concerns towards the end of the window, yet Saints retained both players despite interest and intense speculation. 'When we made the decision as a club, I have to say that there were conversations afterwards, but it never got uncomfortable,' Krueger said. 'It never left the realm of being respectful and I respect Morgan even more today than I did when this all started, just because of the end process, the decisions we made and we gave him time. 'I said right from the start that I was never upset about his immediate reaction, knowing that we're all human beings and that can happen. 'Over time he's shown so much character and his reaction has been on the pitch to be the best possible player he can be and to accept the decision. 'It's a great example for an approach where a club and a player maybe has differences, but always deals eye-to-eye, we communicated very openly with each other.'","Manager Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff went to Tottenham .

"By . David Wilkes . It was one of the most haunting tales to emerge from the Titanic disaster. While others rushed to the lifeboats as the ship sank, millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim stoically sat sipping brandy with his personal secretary Victor Giglio, declaring they were 'prepared to go down like gentlemen'. 'No woman shall be left aboard this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward,' he told a survivor. Loyal: A newly-discovered photograph Victor Guglio, left, shows the valet had dark-skin, which may explain why his master Ben Guggenheim chose to go down on the liner rather than allow the servant to be denied a place on a 'first class' lifeboat . Guggenheim famously told other passengers 'we've dressed in our best and we'll go down like gentlemen' as they smoked cigars in the dining room. The immortal words were recorded in the 1997 Titanic film (pictured) Now, for the first time, a face can be put to the name of Mr Giglio. The first ever picture of Victor Guglio was found by Fr Anselm Cramer at the boarding school where the boy was educated . An archivist at Ampleforth, the North Yorkshire boarding school he attended, has unearthed this picture (right) of him aged 12. The photograph – taken in 1901, 11 . years before he died on the Titanic – shows Mr Giglio, the son of an . Italian father and Egyptian mother, dressed in his school uniform for a . group shot. Unlike the much-photographed U.S. industrialist Mr Guggenheim, who died aged 46, no photographs of Mr . Giglio were believed to exist. But after the Maritime Museum in . Liverpool appealed for information about Mr Giglio to mark the 100th . anniversary of the sinking, Fr Anselm Cramer, the archivist and . librarian at Roman Catholic boarding school Ampleforth, uncovered the . lost image in the school's files. He also found tributes to Mr Giglio, . who was the youngest of four brothers born in Liverpool to an Italian . father and Egyptian mother, in the school's journal from 1912 and 1913. One, from then Ampleforth headmaster . Father Edmund Matthews, said: 'Those who knew Giglio at school will not . require any assurance that he met death bravely and even willingly . rather than, perhaps, take the place of someone else in the lifeboats.' One of his schoolmates added at the . time: 'I did not expect to see his name in the list of survivors. Giglio . was unlikely to be saved when any were lost.' Passengers wait to be rescued in Julian Fellowes' Titanic drama, which also depicted Guggenheim's last words. It is likely that Guglio would have been denied a lifeboat because of his skin colour . Fateful voyage: The cruise liner Titanic sets off from Southampton docks on April 10, 1912 . In a further journal a year on from . the disaster Mr Giglio's mother is reported to have presented the school . with books and music as a memorial to her son, who was a talented . pianist. Yesterday Fr Cramer said: 'Going back . to Victor's time a greater part of the student body came from the . thriving Catholic business community in Liverpool, so it is not . surprising that he attended Ampleforth.' John Graves, Curator of Ship History . at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, South East London, . confirmed: 'It is a rare photograph, I'm not aware of any other . photographs of Victor Giglio. 'He must have been valued by Guggenheim because he travelled first class with him. 'His chauffeur, who also died on the Titanic, was travelling second class.'

'There were offers on the table but Southampton made a clear choice, which was to keep me after the departure of certain players. They look to me for the future.

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Sadio Mane could miss Southampton's Premier League clash with Newcastle after work permit regulations delayed his return to the south coast. Saints boss Ronald Koeman has revealed the Senegal forward had to take a detour via Ghana on his journey back to England after scoring in his national side's 2-0 victory in Botswana on Wednesday night. Mane is expected back at Southampton on Friday from African Nations Cup duty, Koeman explained. Sadio Mane's delayed return from international duty might cause him to miss the match against Newcastle . The 22-year-old transfer-window capture had to make his stop-off in Ghana to fulfil work permit requirements. Mane is still awaiting his Saints debut after joining the club from Red Bull Salzburg in an £11.8million deal. 'I hope he can still be involved,' said Koeman, ahead of Saturday's St Mary's Stadium meeting with Newcastle. 'He played on Wednesday night and then he had to travel to Ghana to get his passport stamp before coming to England. 'So hopefully he'll be back on Friday.' Sadio Mane signed for Southampton this summer from Red Bull Salzburg in a £11.8m deal . Former Dutch defender Koeman said Mane could take a seat on the bench if he makes it back in time for the Newcastle clash. The new Saints boss will most likely start Dusan Tadic and Shane Long up front, given other injuries in his forward line. 'It will be a late decision to see if he is available,' said Koeman. 'Maybe he can still play, but we have to wait until Friday. 'He won't be able to train, but he's experienced enough to play if needed and he would probably go on the bench. 'We have injuries to Lloyd Isgrove and Sam Gallagher, so we don't have too many forwards available at the moment.' Ronald Koeman lamented his lack of forwards as his side prepare to host Alan Pardew's Newcastle . Koeman has backed Mane to make a big impression at Saints, now the south coast club's squad is settled after the transfer window closure. 'Sadio brings a different quality to the team: a player who is very fast with a good threat of goals,' he said. 'We don't have a lot of forward players and with his quality he brings a little bit more to us to find space. 'He's very fast and it's difficult for players to mark that kind of player. He needs time to adapt of course, but he has the quality. 'The Premier League is a higher level than he was used to in the league with Red Bull, but he has played in the Champions League so he has already been exposed to a high quality of opponent.'

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . Sex scandal: Rotherham Council already faces a group legal action by 15 abuse victims from the town but the firm representing them . The victims of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal could be paid up to £140million in compensation, the solicitor representing them revealed today. South Yorkshire law firm  Switalskis is working on behalf of 15 women who were raped and sexually exploited over a 16 year period and are seeking at least £100,000 from the council for each victim. As children they were among 1,400 victims habitually abused by  men in the town – almost all of them of Pakistani origin - because the council and police turned a blind eye to their plight. Switalskis' head of child abuse, David Greenwood, told MailOnline today that after yesterday's damning report the authorities have a 'duty' to offer compensation to each of the 1,400 victims identified. The council and police have admitted 'systemic failures' allowed predators to abuse on an 'industrial' scale and are certain to face a bill for millions of pounds in compensation. The cash could come from the local authority's reserves, from borrowing or the sale of assets. This would leave Rotherham Council with a potential bill of approaching £140million, which would be paid out because many victims have been unable to work because of their ordeal. Mr Greenwood said that recently Rochdale Council, another local authority who failed to cope with paedophile rings in their area, recently paid out £115,000 to a victim. 'We represent 15 women who suffered abuse in Rotherham and two more have contacted us in the 24 hours since the report was released. 'It is important to remember that at the time of the abuse they were children under the age of 16 and could not legally consent. 'The council are aware of them and we are at the stage where we would like to agree compensation settlements with them. If this fails then we will go to court. 'Rotherham Council and South Yorkshire Police missed clear opportunities to prevent the sexual exploitation of dozens of girls in Rotherham. 'This is an extraordinary case but Rochdale recently settled for £115,000 with one victim, I would say on average we would be looking for £100,000 each. 'If it is found that in other cases the council held information that could have prevented abuse they would also be liable'. Legal battle: Should Rotherham Council settle with victims it could be faced with a bill of up to £140million . 'They have suffered horrific abuse but they are part of a wider group. The council has a duty to use the information now in its hands to find them and agree settlements'. If the council agreed to pay compensation to every victim it would be left with a huge bill. Birmingham City Council admitted in 2012 it may have to sell landmarks like the NEC centre to cover up to £1billion in legal claims over equal pay. Thousands of women were found to be paid less than others, mainly men, who did the same or equivalent jobs, and won their case in court as part of a huge group action. If Rotherham Council  faced similar problems they may be forced to sell buildings and land. MailOnline has approached them for a comment.","Law firm leading action says council has 'duty' to compensate 1,400 victims .

With a perilous runway that jut out into the sea, and a descent through skyscrapers and craggy mountains, Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong was seen as the ultimate test of a pilot's skills.

The Kai Tak landing required special training as pilots had to take a challenging last-minute manual turn known as a 'Hong Kong Turn' after they saw a checkerboard reference point above Kowloon Tsai Park.

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . Cheat: Dean Ahmed, 49, claimed he needed income support and disability living allowance while earning substantial amounts of money from his properties . A benefits cheat who built up a £1million property empire while claiming to be too ill to work has been jailed. Dean Ahmed, 49, had a secret luxury property empire while posing as a single, disabled man who deserved state handouts. While receiving the benefits - income support and disability living allowance - he banked more than £100,000 while also collecting rent from at least ten houses across Europe. A court heard Ahmed had three houses in Spain and seven in Wales which he rented out. He was jailed for two years and eight months after the court heard he was also paid disability living allowance for being too ill to get a job. All the while the illicit property entrepreneur had lived in a plush apartment in Cardiff Bay - and bought another six in the same waterfront area. Cardiff Crown Court heard he used a false identity to obtain mortgages  and had built up a hidden property portfolio worth close to £1million. Recorder Paul Hopkins told him: 'You were professional, well-organised and ruthlessly dishonest.' Ahmed was jailed after admitting 15 charges: four counts of money laundering, three of mortgage fraud and eight of benefit and council tax fraud. Forensic investigation of his finances found he was 'actively profiting as a property landlord, and had pocketed substantial rental income from his portfolio.' He he had three luxurious apartments in Murcia, Spain, and regularly transferred large amounts of money to banks in the country. The financial investigation also uncovered the sale and purchase of properties, many within the Cardiff Bay area, sourced by false mortgage applications. Seven homes: A financial investigation found that Ahmed had seven properties in Cardiff Bay, Wales . Place(s) in the sun: Ahmed also had three luxurious properties in Murcia, Spain .

'The case should also serve as a warning to others who may be involved or tempted to commit these kinds of offences.

"By . Helen Pow . Americans will spend more on their Fourth of July barbecues this year than ever before after the price of items such as beef, lettuce and ice cream hit an all-time high for the month. Independence Day is the most popular time of year for outdoor grilling but an index tracking U.S. retail prices for seven foods commonly enjoyed during the holiday shot up 5.1 percent in May from a year earlier to the highest ever for the month, the latest data from Bureau of Labor Statistics show. The Bloomberg-compiled barbecue index follows the price of ground beef, white bread, American cheese, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, ice cream and potato chips - all items commonly enjoyed during summer socializing. Beefing up the price: Smoke wafts up as hamburgers are prepared on a grill outside the White House in Washington, Thursday, July 3, 2014. The cost of ground beef is up 16 percent on last year . But prices for ground beef are 16.5 percent higher than a year ago, thanks to a shrinking U.S. cattle herd. Meanwhile tomatoes, a traditional burger addition, soared 12 percent and ice cream climbed 1.7 percent, according to the figures. American cheese was up 11.1 percent year on year for May 2014. However, potato chips fell in price, down 3.1 per cent compared to the same time in 2013. Drought in California was blamed for increased produce costs.

'I would expect the overall grilling demand to be very good. The natural long weekend will be a benefit.' However, price-conscious families may attempt to offset costs. 'Do we expect there to be some trade-offs and some adjustments made on the behalf of some consumers?

"By . James Chapman . and Vanessa Allen . David Cameron faces acute embarrassment over his friendship with former newspaper boss Rebekah Brooks after she claimed he signed off his text messages to her with ‘LOL’, wrongly believing it stood for ‘lots of love’. Mrs Brooks told the Leveson inquiry into media standards that the Prime Minister stopped using the acronym after she told him it actually meant ‘laugh out loud’ in the text-speak more commonly used by teenagers. But she dismissed as ‘preposterous’ claims he had texted her as much as 12 times a day, saying they both had ‘better things to do’ and it was typically once a week. LOL! Scroll down to see the comment . Revelations: Rebekah Brooks gives evidence to the Leveson Inquiry as she discusses emails and texts between politicians . In an extraordinary five-hour evidence session, the former News International chief executive lifted the veil on her close relationships with the PM and his predecessors Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. She said Mr Cameron, Mr Blair and Chancellor George Osborne all sent her ‘indirect’ messages of support last year as her career was engulfed by the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World. Mrs Brooks detailed 19 private meetings with Mr Cameron over five years, and said Tony Blair and his allies were a ‘constant presence’ in her life during the New Labour years. She described how Mr Blair and Mr Brown competed jealously for her attention as their feud threatened to destroy the Labour government. Friendly: Rebekah Brooks is recorded kissing David Cameron as she welcomes him to a glamorous party attended by a string of influential figures . Friends: Mr Cameron appears startles after being photographed alongside Mrs Brooks at a book launch in 2009. The pair are said to have texted each other regularly . But to Downing Street’s relief, she went out of her way to dismiss the more damaging conspiracy theories swirling around Mr Cameron, insisting he had never given any private assurances the Government would approve a controversial Murdoch takeover bid for BSkyB. The 43-year-old former editor of the Sun and the News of the World confirmed that Mr Cameron sent her a message ‘along the lines’ of ‘keep your head up’ as the hacking scandal escalated, telling her he regretted not being able to be more loyal to her in public. She received similar messages from 11 Downing Street, the Home Office, the Foreign Office and some senior Labour politicians, including Mr Blair. Mr Brown and wife Sarah had at one stage organised a birthday party for her, she said, but their relationship soured after the Sun abandoned support for Labour during his premiership and he did not contact her after she resigned. ‘He was probably getting the bunting out,’ Mrs Brooks suggested. For those unacquainted with text language, terms such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud) and OMG (Oh My God) were first used by teenagers to speed up the sending of messages. David Cameron - modern man? Examples of text-speak include plz for please, 2moro for tomorrow and WUU2 for what are you up to? Not to mention BRB: Be right back; LOLZ: Lots of laughs; ROFL: Rolling on the floor laughing; BTW: By the way; TMI: Too much information; SMH: Shake my head; KMT: Kiss my teeth. She insisted she had never abused her friendships with politicians, or allowed them to skew the editorial coverage of them in her newspapers. Of her texts from the Prime Minister, she said: ‘He would sign them off “DC” in the main. Occasionally he would sign them off “LOL”, lots of love, actually until I told him it meant “laugh out loud”. Then he didn’t sign them like that any more.’ The Prime Minister is known to have used the ‘LOL’ sign-off in text messages to other people. Publisher and radio presenter Iain Dale, a former Tory candidate, said: ‘David Cameron has also signed off a couple of texts to me “LOL, DC x”. He does it to lots of people.’ Mrs Brooks said she met or dined with Mr Blair at least 30 times between 1998 and 2007, including three tete-a-tete. She had at least five encounters with his successor Mr Brown before their relationship deteriorated.She said her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, and his family were long-standing friends of the Camerons and described regular meetings with the PM and his wife Samantha. She entertained them at her home in the Cotswolds and Mr Cameron invited her to his family home and also to Chequers, three times. On two occasions Mr and Mrs Brooks entertained Mr Cameron at their home, including a now notorious Christmas lunch in 2010 when it has emerged that the Murdochs’ bid for BSkyB was briefly discussed. Mrs Brooks said the issue had come up because days earlier Business Secretary Vince Cable had been stripped of responsibility to approve the bid after being covertly recorded saying he had ‘declared war on Murdoch’. Culture Secretary Mr Hunt had been handed responsibility for the issue. Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked if she had been ‘party to any conversations along the lines that Dr Cable had acted in breach of duty, let’s hope the next one, Mr Hunt, does not’. ‘Not necessarily, but clearly that was our view,’ she said. ‘We hoped that it would be a very fair process and that it would be fair and democratic.’ Mrs Brooks suggested she might have told Mr Cameron of her disappointment that Dr Cable’s ‘personal prejudice’ had been influencing the Government, adding that ‘at least now the decision would be fair’. ‘Mr Cameron always made it very clear that it was a quasi-judicial decision, it wasn’t [for] him, it was off his remit,’ she added.

She complained during her appearance today that a lot of trivial questions had been put to her - in her evidence she quashed a rumour that the pair used to swim together when Mr Murdoch was in London. She also denied that, after she was arrested in 2005 over an alleged assault on her then-husband, Mr Murdoch sent an outfit to the police station where she was being held. Mrs Brooks was released without charge and the police took no further action.

'I think that my relationship with Mr Murdoch - if I was a grumpy old man of Fleet Street, no one would write the first thing about it,' she said. She said it would be the 'height of hypocrisy' for her to complain about intrusions into her personal life, but said: 'However, I have had these complaints from people in my career as a journalist and I have always tried to understand and always tried to use my judgment to where the line fell. 'As to my own situation, well, it's been a difficult year, but a lot of the questions that I have had from Mr Jay (Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry), I felt concentrated on quite a trivial side. 'I am happy to discuss them but I'm not sure it helps this inquiry, whether Mr Murdoch bought me a suit or not, or I went swimming with him.""She told the inquiry the Murdochs were ""just like any normal family, they have dynamics and they change'. Asked by Mr Jay if a claim made in Vanity Fair that she became a 'go-between' in an increasingly fraught relationship between Rupert and James Murdoch was true, she said: 'No, they could speak to each other. I reported both to James and Rupert Murdoch and I would talk to them both about the issues unfolding at News International. 'James and I had offices next door to each other. I would be talking to Mr Murdoch every day. And if Vanity Fair wants to couch that as a go-between, then fine, but I don't accept the premise of what they are insinuating.' What will she tell?

"By . Suzannah Hills . He was a celebrated symbol of peace and democracy the world over. But in the last years of his life, Nelson Mandela's own family has been at war, bickering between themselves over his many millions. And in the wake of the anti-apartheid leader's death at 95 today, it is feared his surviving family will be plunged in to deep rifts over who stands to gain his fortune. Mandela was married three times and fathered six children - only three of whom, his daughters Makaziwe, Zenani 'Zeni' and Zindziswa, are still alive. Bitter dispute: Makaziwe Mandela, left, and her . sister Zenani, right with Nelson Mandela, are locked in a legal wrangle . with two of their father's oldest friends over a £1million trust fund . set up by the former South African president in 2005 . 'Lost trust': Nelson Mandela is said to have put £1million of his money in a trust fund to stop his family arguing over it . Legal rows: Nelson Mandela, centre, is surrounded by his grandchildren - many of whom supported a legal bid to gain control of a Mandela art merchandise company - at his house in Qunu, Eastern Cape, on his 90th birthday . His daughter Makaziwe, from his first marriage, and Zenani, from his second marriage, have reportedly already become embroiled in a legal battle earlier this year over the control of a £1million trust fund. Mr Mandela's third daughter, Zindzi, is not involved in the court action, the Star of South Africa reported. The money was placed in the fund by Mr Mandela in 2005 to be distributed to his daughters only in the event of hardship as he wanted them to forge a career of their own rather than live off his money. He is said to have set up around 27 such funds over the years after 'losing trust' in his children with the money intended to last generations for 'specific circumstances' and not general use. But Makaziwe and Zanani are demanding access to the fund and have begun legal action against the trust's two directors; 84-year-old lawyer George Bizos, who defended Mandela in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, and 60-year-old Tokyo Sexwale who was a prisoner alongside Mandela on Robben Island. Legal action: Two of Mandela's daughters are . suing for control of the trust, which is under the control of lawyer . George Bizos (pictured in 1991, left) and Tokyo Sexwale, right .

Ziphokazi Manaway, and Zamaswazi Dlamini pictured right holding baby . Zamakhosi Obiri last year. Zaziwe appeared in the reality TV show 'Being . Mandela' earlier this year . Supported by almost all of Mr Mandela's grandchildren, Makaziwe and Zenani allege that the trust was intended for them and that Mr Bizos and Mr Sexwale 'hijacked' it. Makaziwe and Zenani have also launched a legal battle against the same two men and another lawyer Bally Chuene who are all directors of companies whose main purpose was to channel funds from the sale of  Mandela's handprints. The two daughters claim that Bizos, Sexwale and Chuene were never appointed by Mandela as major shareholders or directors. Bizos claims the allegations are completely false. It is understood that Mandela has accumulated a fortune of more than £10million from his many autobiographies, intellectual work and after turning his family name in to a brand - a move his family have been more than happy to take advantage of. The family is active in more than 110 trading companies, according to records compiled by Beeld newspaper. Famous name: Swati Dlamini, left, and Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway, star in reality show 'Being Mandela' Trade name: Nelson Mandela's daughter Makaziwe, pictured left with United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa at a Pretoria hospital to visit Mandela on Monday, runs the House of Mandela wine company . His daughter Makaziwe has founded the House of Mandela wine label and is reportedly an active director in 16 other companies, although she insists some directorships have lapsed. Addressing claims that the Mandela family are exploiting their name, Makaziwe has been quoted as saying: 'It's our name anyway. Why should we apologise for our name? 'I'm in the wine industry. There are families who've been in the wine industry for 500 years and no one says they are cashing in on their name. 'Every child in this family who wants to use the Mandela name has a right to do, so as long as they do so with honour and integrity and upholding the values of my father.' Meanwhile, many of his grandchildren control other franchise companies or products. He has 17 grandchildren and a growing number of great-grandchildren - several of whom have been accused of trying to make money off the back of their family ties with the famous leader. Nelson Mandela married three times, fathering six children, only three of whom are alive today. Mandela married his first wife Evelyn Ntoko Mase in 1944 but they divorced 13 years later. The couple had two sons, Madiba 'Thembi' Thembekile, who died in 1969, and Makgatho Mandela who died in 2005. They had a daughter named Makaziwe 'Maki' Mandela who died a few months after being born in 1947 and named their second daughter in her honour. He married his second wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 1957 and they divorced in 1996. They had two daughters, Zenani 'Zeni' and Zindziswa 'Zindzi' Mandela-Hlongwane. Mandela remarried on his 80th birthday in 1998 to Graça Machel who he was still married to at the time of his death. He has 17 grandchildren - the oldest born in 1965 and the youngest in 1992 - and a growing number of great-grandchildren. Two of his granddaughters - Zenani's two daughters Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway and Swati Dlamini who are both in their 30s - appeared in a reality TV show called 'Being Mandela'. While the 94-year-old former South African president does not appear in the show, his second wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela - 'Big Mommy' to her grandchildren - has a central role. The sisters, along with two brothers, also launched a fashion line, called 'Long Walk to Freedom' in honour of their grandfather's autobiography. Many family members have also become embroiled in scandals - with his grandson Mandla Mandela being accused of bigamy when he wed French teenager Anais Grimaud while still apparently married to his first wife. The pair then later split when the couple's child was alleged to have been fathered by one of his brothers. Mandla is the oldest son of Nelson's late son Makgatho. He was born in 1974, followed by Ndaba (1983), Mbusu (1991) and Andile (1993). It is not known which brother was involved with his wife. Mandla has also been accused in the past of trying to sell the TV coverage rights to his grandfather's funeral for £225,000. Family members have also accused Mandla of wanting to evict a cousin from her home near Johannesburg in order to turn it into a tourist attraction. Mandela denied the allegations. As well as financial rifts and court battles, Mandela's family has also been struck by many tragedies over the years. His son, Makgatho Mandela died of AIDS in 2005 and Mandela's great-granddaughter, 13-year-old Zenani Mandela, was killed in a car crash caused by a driver travelling at twice the 80km/h speed limit on a motorway in South Africa in 2010.","Nelson Mandela died after being admitted to hospital .

"By . Associated Press . The orphaned Florida teen whose impassioned plea for a family to 'love him forever' prompted an outpouring of sympathy from around the country has been removed from his foster home following a physical altercation with another child and the father. After 16 years of floundering in foster care, after taking the pulpit at a St. Petersburg church last September asking someone - anyone - to adopt him, after his story was shared around the world and 10,000 people offered to help or take him home, Davion Only moved to Ohio in March to live with the parents who had promised to care for him forever and love him no matter what. The couple, a minister and his wife, flew Davion up to visit over spring break. They introduced him to their three children and took him to church. Davion came back to Florida just long enough to pack a small suitcase. Altercation: Davion Only has been removed from his Ohio foster home following a physical altercation with members of the family . Still without a family: Davion Only, 16, who has spent his whole life in foster care and begged for anyone to adopt him at his church . Then he returned to Ohio, where his prospective parents signed him up to play football - something he had always wanted to do. 'I got baptized!' he wrote April 20, from his new phone, on his new Facebook page. The adoption could take place in 90 days, said Terri Durdaller, whose agency, Eckerd, oversees Tampa Bay's foster children. That would have meant that Davion could be adopted this month. Instead, he is back in Pinellas County, at a therapeutic foster home, upset and embarrassed, unwilling to talk.'There was an incident in Ohio,' said Eckerd's director, Lorita Shirley. At one point, she said, things got physical between Davion and another child in the house, and with the dad. The family wanted him out. On May 30, Davion's case manager flew to Ohio and brought him back to Florida. 'This has been a major setback for him,' Shirley said. 'Our goal now is to get him treatment.' Davion Navar Henry Only was born while his mom was in jail. He started searching for her last June, after he finished his first year in high school. She had died just a few weeks before. That's when he knew, his counselors said, that she wasn't coming to get him. That's when he decided to find a family himself. Stuck in the system: Davion is now back in a home in Florida after being removed from the home of a pastor and his wife and children with whom he was living . Emotional plea: The orphan speaks before St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church to ask if someone would become his parent . Unstable childhood: Davion has been in the foster system his entire life, going from one temporary home to the next . Davion said he was tired of sharing a group home with 12 teen boys, all with problems. Tired of locked refrigerators and cameras recording everything. He wanted someone to support him. To believe in him. Last summer, he went to the gym and lost 40 pounds. Last fall, he buckled down at school, started getting A's. He tried to control his temper, be the kind of kid someone would want. 'I'll take anyone,' Davion said last September. 'Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care.' 'I know God hasn't given up on me,' he told the packed congregation at St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church. 'So I'm not giving up either.' His story went viral. After appearing on the front page of the Tampa Bay Times October 8, Davion's plea was picked up by news outlets across the world. Producers of The View flew him to New York to talk to Barbara Walters. Inspiring: Davion Only at 15 with his case worker Connie Going in September before nervously making his speech before the congregation . Simple wish: Davion Only, the orphan whose plight gripped the nation, attended many interviews across the country about his plight . More than 10,000 strangers called offering to help or adopt him. Eckerd workers returned 2,500 of those calls, said Durdaller, the agency's spokeswoman. At first, Eckerd officials tried to connect Davion with a second cousin, a sheriff's deputy who learned of Davion through the newspaper. When that didn't work, they moved him from the group home to be with a foster family. But that family never intended to adopt Davion. In early March, Davion called his former adoptions specialist to say, 'I had a blowout.' The foster family refused to keep him. But it was okay, Davion said then. He had met this great couple from Ohio. A minister and his wife with a bunch of kids. They said they wanted him. Finally, someone wanted him. 'On paper, this was the book-definition perfect family for him,' said Shirley, Eckerd's director. 'The father was a pastor who had worked with troubled kids. They knew about Davion's background and his issues.' 'The biggest thing that went wrong is that Davion spent 15 years in the system,' said Shirley. 'He has a lot of built up anger. It's been very devastating for everyone involved.' Sad discovery: Davion started to look for his mother, whom he . had never met, using his birth certificate at a local library in June. He found her obituary and discovered that La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud (left) had died aged 55 in Clearwater just weeks before . Biological family: Carolyn Ware, grandmother of Davion Only, spent time with her grandson over Thanksgiving . Wanted him back: Davion's aunt Doris Barnes, pictured left in October, said Davion belongs with his biological family. She said she would take him in - but is not allowed because she has a criminal record . Eckerd therapists refused to let Davion talk to the media. He didn't respond to Facebook messages. He no longer has a cellphone. The Ohio family didn't respond to requests either. 'Davion is a maturing young man whose perspective on life continues to change as it does with most teenagers,' reads a statement from Eckerd. 'After Davion spent time with a prospective adoptive family this spring, it was determined that the family was not the right fit for him, with that we are asking for privacy during this stage of his life.' Since September, when Davion asked God and strangers for help, he has been moved away from his friends at his group home and school. He has lost his adoptions specialist. And he has cycled through four families. His mentor, 22-year-old Richard Prince, said he hasn't seen Davion since he was sent back to Florida. 'I'm extremely worried about him,' Prince said. 'We had a short conversation a couple of weeks ago, but it was very unsettling.' Eckerd's website has its own page devoted to Davion, which has raised money and awareness about other teenagers in foster care. 'I am currently matched with a family,' says his profile. Wanted him back: Davion's aunt Doris Barnes, pictured left in October, said Davion belongs with his biological family. She said she would take him in - but is not allowed because she has a criminal record . Adorable: Davion, pictured at the age of seven, has been in foster care in Florida for his whole life . Which is no longer true. 'When he is ready, we will continue down the list of people who have expressed interest in him,' said Shirley. 'Now, we might be looking at empty-nesters, people who raised teenagers but don't have any other kids in their house. That might be the best match for him.' Since September, when Davion took the pulpit, 339 children in Pinellas and Pasco counties have been adopted. But the boy who became the face for older adoption, whose 'Davion Effect' was touted in Tallahassee and on TV talk shows, is still alone. Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him .","Davion Only, 16, has been removed from the home of his prospective adoptive family .

"By . Anthony Hay for MailOnline . Follow @@Anthony_Hay . Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber has told FIFA he would be interested in trialling Sepp Blatter's video referral system proposal in America as the idea is music to his ears. Blatter wants to give managers the ability to challenge referee's calls during stops in play if they feel a decision was unfair. Managers will be able to watch an incident with the referee on an off-pitch monitor before the official decides if a decision should be overturned or not. Sepp Blatter's idea has been given the thumbs up by Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber . The MLS could be the first to use a video referral system if Sepp Blatter's referral system is ratified by FIFA . Commissioner Don Garber, far left, is keen on trialling Sepp Blatter's proposal in the MLS . The MLS were unable to introduce goal-line technology as they did not have the relevant funding . Blatter's proposal has been given the thumbs up by Garber who has put the MLS forward to act as a guinea pig to test the FIFA president's latest idea. Garber, speaking to SI.com, said of using video technology to review decisions: '[It is] music to my ears. I would love to be able to do that. [MLS deputy commissioner] Mark Abbott was out in Zurich at a meeting last week [at FIFA headquarters] and let folks in Zurich know that we’d be happy to work with them to be that league. 'I don’t know what their plans are to experiment with that, but I believe the time has come for there to be a mechanism so that games are not determined by [referee calls] that are not right.' The MLS were previously keen on introducing goal-line technology however the league later said the system was out of their budget. How should it work? Blatter’s system will require a coach/manager to inform the fourth official that they are requesting a decision to be reviewed, rather like a tennis player or cricket captain does with Hawk-Eye. At the next stoppage in play the fourth official would tell the referee who would then look at a replay of the incident. If there is a clear error then he will overturn his decision, if not it will stand. How many referrals per team/half/match? This is to be confirmed but I would expect no more than two challenges per team  and possibly only one per half. If the challenge proves to be correct then the coach will retain this challenge but if the referee was right then the challenge will have been used. When will it be used? Penalties – both those given and those not given, often when simulation is involved. The issue with that appeal is the call is often subjective and replays are ambiguous and open to interpretation. Offside calls that are clearly wrong can be challenged and corrected but only those leading to goals. These happen infrequently as Premier League assistants are so good but the Liverpool-Chelsea game last month would be one which would have benefitted from such legislation. Finally red card tackles and off-the-ball incidents could also benefit from referees reviewing replays but these might not be covered by this proposal.

"By . Beth Stebner . and Associated Press . Microsoft Corp. is planning to issue a dramatic update to its phone software, one that won't be available to current Windows Phones, in an effort to gain a foothold against the omnipresent iPhone and Android models. The new software, Windows Phone 8, will be available on new phones this fall, Microsoft said Wednesday at a presentation in San Francisco. The software will bring Windows phones closer to PCs and tablets running the company's upcoming Windows 8, which is also scheduled to launch later this year. Scroll down for video . Something new: Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president of Microsoft, introduced the Windows Phone 8 mobile operating system Wednesday in San Francisco . Synchronicity: The software will bring Windows phones closer to PCs and tablets running the company's upcoming Windows 8, which is also scheduled to launch later this year . With its planned software updates -and the Surface tablet computer it introduced earlier this week- Microsoft is taking dramatic steps to ensure that it plays a major role in the increasingly important mobile market. But the company is playing catch-up in an arena dominated by Apple and Google. Microsoft launched Windows Phone 7 in 2010, making a clean break with its previous phone software, which had become outdated. Nokia Corp., until recently the world's biggest maker of phones, has pledged to use it for all its smartphones, and launched its first Windows Phone in the U.S. earlier this year. Sales have been anaemic, however. IDC estimated that 2.2 per cent of the smartphones shipped worldwide in the first quarter of this year ran Microsoft's software, compared to 23 per cent for Apple and 59 per cent for Android. Making a point: Kevin Shields, Nokia's senior vice president, also spoke at the event . Still, U.S. wireless carriers support Windows Phone, seeing it as a valuable counterweight to the clout of Apple Inc.'s iPhone and phones running Google Inc.'s Android software. The new Windows Phone 8 will attempt to compete with the likes of the ever-popular iPhone and Android with features including a turn-by-turn navigational system, a newer, faster browser, and tiles that can be custom-fit to the screen. But, as MSNBC notes, the most ostensibly important feature is what’s under the hood – the Windows operating system. Because the phone will share a similar platform as any Windows PC, games, software, and web browsers can run on phones, a feat that is not currently achievable with other smart phones. It also offers ‘wallet’ technology, allowing safe use for storing credit and banking data as well as other sensitive personal information. Windows Phone is making progress in one respect. Hit games 'Words With Friends' and 'Draw Something' will be among the apps available for Windows 8. There are 100,000 applications available for Windows phones today, Microsoft said. That's far less than the number of apps available for iPhones and Android phones. Windows Phone 8 will accept expansion memory cards, like Android phones do. It will also work on processors with more than one computing 'core,' which is common in high-end smartphones. More cores boost computing power and can cut power consumption. The new software will also work with near-field communications chips, allowing phones to be used in place of credit cards at some payment terminals. At the conference, Microsoft's head of phone software, Joe Belfiore, demonstrated how NFC can be used to link two phones so their owners can play a Scrabble-like game. Tapping the phones together can engage NFC, and prompt the devices to establish a link over Wi-Fi. Some recent Android phones come with NFC capabilities, but they're missing from the iPhone. Windows Phone 8 will share the operating system 'kernel,' or most basic functions, with Windows 8 RT, which will run on tablets and computers. That means manufacturers will have an easier time making hardware that can use either system. Developers will have an easier time moving applications from one platform to the other, Microsoft said. Changing its phone software at such a basic level means that it will be difficult to install on existing Windows phones.","Microsoft announced that Windows Phone 8 to be launched this fall at press conference in San Francisco .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Researchers found the one glass of wine many drivers think is acceptable may be too much for over-55s . Having just one glass of wine could be enough to dangerously affect older drivers, researchers have warned. In tests comparing the effects of alcohol on different age groups, they found that the driving skills of the over-55s plummeted compared to younger people. The research involved 36 people aged 25 to 35 and 36 people aged 55 to 70 who took a computer-based driver simulation test while sober and then again after varying amounts of alcohol, although not enough to put them over the drink-drive limit. Each person was assessed as they ‘drove’ down a simulated three-mile stretch of winding country road. The drivers stared straight ahead at a large computer monitor. Two computer monitors flanked the first, mimicking the side windows of a car and what the drivers would see in their peripheral vision. Occasionally, the drivers would encounter an oncoming car, but they did not encounter other distractions, 'not even a cow'. After a drink, and a time lapse to mimic having alcohol with their dinner and then driving home, they were put behind the wheel again. The researchers from the University of Florida found that the small, legal levels of intoxication only affected the driving abilities of the older group. They assessed the drivers’ ability to stay in the centre of their lane and maintain a constant speed. They also looked at how rapidly they adjusted their steering wheel. Professor of psychiatry and psychology Dr Sara Jo Nixon said they found it a ‘bit surprising’ that younger drivers’ skills were not affected by the alcohol, although she warned that the tests did not prove they would be safer on real roads. The researchers found young people managed to stay in the centre of their lane and maintain the same speed . PhD student Alfredo Sklar said: 'These simulations have been used a lot in looking at older adults, and they have been used at looking how alcohol affects the driving of younger adults, but no one’s ever looked at the combination of aging drivers and alcohol.' Further research is planned to measure how the brain responds during the driving test when dosed with alcohol. The findings are published in the journal Psychopharmacology.","Different aged groups took simulated test before and after a drink .

But Harry Herbert, racing manager to the filly’s owner Qatari Sheik Joaan Al Thani, said the decision would not cause a fracture in Dettori’s job as No 1 jockey to the Sheik’s Al Shaqab racing empire. Dettori will be replaced on Treve, firstly in Sunday’s Group One Prix Vermeille at Longchamp, by veteran French rider Thierry Jarnet at the request of the filly’s trainer Criquette Head-Maarek.

Fronting up: Harry Herbert (left) has explained the decision to switch jockeys . ‘There is nothing more to read into this other than it is a trainer’s request. ‘It is all tiny percentages at this level and Criquette, seeing how well Jarnet gets on with Treve, particularly in the mornings, feels it is an advantage which should be taken. ‘We are all big Frankie fans but the Sheik felt that if Criquette felt that strongly it was her decision.’ Dettori will now be at The Curragh on Sunday where he will ride Richard Hannon-trained Al Shaqab filly Osaila in the Moyglare Stud Stakes. Calling the shots: Trainer Criquette Head-Maarek has replaced Dettori in the raddle . On Tuesday he is at Chantilly to ride the Sheik’s £5.25million filly Al Namah. The Dettori blow comes on the same weekend that back in 2012 saw him overlooked for the ride on Godolphin St Leger winner Encke. That which prompted a spiral of events that saw him end his long association with Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin operation.","Italian jockey replaced in the saddle by French rider Thierry Jarnet .

"By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . So near, yet so far away. The chance of a first Classic success for Roger Varian is so close he can probably smell it. But between this morning's penultimate declaration stage and Saturday's £650,000 Ladbrokes St Leger lies potentially nerve-shredding tension for the 35-year-old in his fourth season training in Newmarket. In his Derby runner-up Kingston Hill, Varian appears to be holding a hand stacked with aces as he chases the fifth and by far the most important Group One of his blossoming career. Kingston Hill is the class act of the line-up in the season's final Classic and 5-2 favourite. Brave:  Roger Varian says the incident reinforced his philosophy that you should live every day like it's your last . But a weather forecast threatening to dry the ground on Doncaster's Town Moor racecourse, venue of the colt's Group One Racing Post Trophy success last October, could throw a spanner in the works for a horse which has missed its last two intended runs when conditions turned against him. It's a scenario that causes no-go zones to be declared around tense, irritable trainers whose patience becomes rationed. But not Varian. He was a born realist and recognises no amount of hollering can turn a tide flowing in the wrong direction. It also helped that that he learned from one of the sport's most level-headed and respected mentors during 10 seasons assisting the late Michael Jarvis whose Kremlin House stables he now occupies. But, more than almost any of us, Varian knows the place in the world of a horse race, even one of the most important ones in the racing calendar. Strength: Varian admits the 48 hours after the incident were difficult but now says he stops being scared . That was a lesson shatteringly learned when he lost elder brother Chris to a brutal murder at the hands of immigrant worker and paranoid schizophrenic whose long history of mental health problems raised uncomfortable questions of why he was not only walking the streets but had even been allowed into the country. Varian said: 'Something changes in you when you have to deal with something like that in your life. You stop being scared of stuff. 'If I ever start worrying about something I always turn my mind back to Chris and say 'what are you worrying about that for? It doesn't matter.' 'All this stuff is trivial. We are training animals to run as fast as they can. As long as I am doing my best, am honest with people and can go to bed at night with a clear conscience, it doesn't really matter. 'Someone asked me recently if having kids put a new perspective on life but my perspective came from losing my brother and the way we lost him. Contender: Kingston Hill is the 5-2 favourite for the St Leger and Varian has high hopes the horse can deliver . 'What happened, unfortunately you read about more in the news than you used to. It is a frighteningly regular occurrence that some families are torn apart through murder. 'I can vividly remember every second of those 48 hours. You just couldn't believe it and I still can't. 'The funny thing is that as soon as it happened, he was the only one at peace. It is the people left behind that are left with the pain. You have to find a way to live with it and deal with it. 'One of my ways was to try to achieve what Chris did not get a chance to achieve – to live what he didn't get a chance to live for. 'We were very close - 18 months apart. I think I will write about it one day because I want the story told, for people to know what happened, how mad it was and what our family went through. 'I am not looking for pity but I also want what Chris went through to be told when I feel I can do it.' A philosophy of living life every day as if it is your last, Varian acknowledges, is an easier to adopt than enact but a win for Kingston Hill would doubtless reignite the joyous celebrations which followed the Racing Post Trophy win with Kingston Hill's owner Paul Smith and his family. Lead: Varian insists Kingston Hill is improving on every run and has a great chance of St. Leger success . Varian, whose valuable success with Battersea at Ascot on Saturday ensured he passed his previous best season's prizemoney tally, admits things have not yet gone to plan this season with Kingston Hill. The colt, which ended its two-year-old career unbeaten in three runs, has yet to win this summer but has run with massive credit each time. Varian is talking ambitious targets before the end of the season for a colt which finished eighth in a vintage 2,000 Guineas and fourth to Mukhadram in the Eclipse at Sandown in July. In between, the way jockey Andrea Atzeni had to burn up fuel to find a good slot from a poor draw in the Derby at Epsom before his length and a quarter second to Australia suggests there is an excellent chance his stamina will last out the extended mile and three-quarters of the St Leger trip. Varian, married to Hanako with two children, Momoka and Eiji, added: 'He has run three great races in three of the most competitive races of the year. 'He hasn't won yet which we are disappointed about but we not disappointed with him. 'I think he is a seriously good horse who does not need soft ground to show that. 'Forget the 2,000 Guineas, he is not a miler. In hindsight, he produced a very creditable run. His Eclipse run was also very good run. 'If you look at the Derby, he got very close to Australia who is turning out to be a very good horse. ' I don't think he will have a problem staying the St Leger trip. Andrea is certain the trip it won't. 'I think the Arc could be on the agenda providing he comes out of this weekend OK or even the Champion Stakes.' Recognised Arc trial the Prix Niel at Longchamp on Sunday is the back-up plan should Kingston Hill have to miss Doncaster but there is a determination to be at the start line. 'The two times I have pulled him out – at the Curragh (before the Irish Derby) and at York (before the Great Voltigeur Stakes) it was very quick - Good to Firm officially but there was no good in it. 'I couldn't take a risk because I think there is a lot to come from this guy.' That patience could be repaid on Saturday.

"By . Mark Prigg . Britain’s leading scientists have named the top 20 most important innovations in the history of food and drink - with fridges, pasteurised milk and tin cans topping the list. The modern innovations beat ancient inventions like the fishing net, the plough, and the cork, without which our ancestors would have struggled to survive. Refrigeration came out on top, while vital methods for food preparation like the pot, the knife and the spoon came 14th, 15th and 16th respectively. Refrigeration was named at the most important breakthrough in food and drink by 75 of Britain's top scientists. A team of 45 top scientists from the Royal Society ranked a shortlist of 20 innovations by their levels of accessibility, productivity, aesthetics and health. The group of Royal Society Fellowes, chaired by Royal Society Treasurer Sir Peter Williams, decided two of the top three discoveries were made in Britain - artificial refrigeration was first demonstrated in Glasgow in 1748, and a British merchant patented the tin can in 1810. However, the first pasteurisation test was completed in France in 1862. Sir Peter Williams said: 'Royal Society Fellows have played vital roles in improving people’s lives for 350 years and science has a major role to play in meeting the global challenges of the 21st century. 'We thought it appropriate to look at how that innovation has shaped what we eat and drink. The tin can was also voted among the most important inventions in food and drink . 'The poll reveals the huge role science and innovation have played in improving our health and our lives. 'This is something to which the scientific community continues to add.' Refrigeration allows food to be kept fresher for longer, allowing people without a large garden to eat a more varied and more nutritious diet. The first known artificial refrigeration was demonstrated by William Cullen at the University of Glasgow, but they were first introduced into homes in the 1920’s. The Royal Society said: 'Refrigeration has played the biggest role of any innovation in improving the diets of millions of people. 'It is responsible for bringing a more varied, interesting, nutritious and more affordable diet to an ever increasing number of people.' Pasteurisation is the process of heating food to a specific temperature to kill bacteria inside and prevent spoilage, and was first used to heat wine in China in 1117. Modern pasteurisation, including immediate cooling, was created by famous microbiologist Louis Pasteur - who was also a pioneer for vaccination. The Royal Society said: 'Improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other foodborne disease outbreak, making it one of the most potentially dangerous food products.' Canning provided a way of preserving all sorts of food, and also makes it easy to be transported. British merchant Peter Durand invented and patented the tin can in 1810, and three years later the UK’s first commercial canning factory was opened - but the can opener was not invented until 50 years later.Krueger Cream Ale became the first canned beer in 1935.

"By . Damien Gayle . A rogue nation could use climate change as an excuse to carry out potentially disastrous experiments with geoengineering, experts warn. A country threatened by rising sea levels or even a wealthy individual could use their resources to tamper with the atmosphere in a bid to cool the planet, with uncertain consequences. The nightmare possibility, which could set off a disastrous chain reaction in the Earth's climate systems, is one possible 'X Factor' considered in a report on global risks by the World Economic Forum. An aircraft leaving a . vapour trail: A new report warns that a rogue nation or individual . could use climate change as an excuse to unilaterally send planes into . the stratosphere to release dust to block light from the Sun . 'The global climate could, in effect, be hijacked by a rogue country or even a wealthy individual, with unpredictable costs to agriculture, infrastructure and global stability,' the report warns. Scientists worried about climate change are exploring ways in which they could artificial manipulate the Earth's climate in an attempt to mitigate some of its worst effects. Many different processes have been mooted for such geoengineering, but the most common suggestion is for 'solar radiation management' in which particles of sulphur could be injected into the stratosphere to block solar energy. In the past, volcanic eruptions have achieved the same effect, and scientists have claimed such solar management would take effect quickly and be cheap to implement. Recent studies have suggested that a small fleet of aircraft could inject a million tons of sulphur compounds into the stratosphere - enough to offset half the global warming recorded to date - for just $1-2billion a year. 'In theory, the technology would be tantamount to a planetary thermostat, giving humans direct control over global temperature,' said the WEF report. 'The direct impact of dimming the sun would be felt within weeks to months.' But the potential side effects of such . large-scale interference with our planet's climate systems are unknown - . and could be disastrous. 'The . problem is that incoming solar radiation drives the entire climate . system, so reducing sunlight would fundamentally alter the way energy . and water moves around the planet,' the report said. 'Almost . any change in weather and climate patterns is likely to create winners . and losers, but determining causation and quantifying impacts on any . given region or country would be a massive challenge.' Melting: These images from Nasa show reveal the full extent of Arctic ice shrinkage, showing a new record low compared to the average minimum extent over the past 30 years (in yellow) The warning came in a special section of the WEF's Global Risks report published on Tuesday which focuses on 'X Factors' - emerging concerns of possible future importance and with unknown consequences. In collaboration with the respected scientific journal Nature, the report's writers present five possible high risk scenarios which could sneak up on an unsuspecting world with little warning. In addition to the threat posed by rogue geoengineers, other X Factors identified in the report include: . Last month a scientist claimed that not only could we use geoengineering to refreeze the Arctic, but that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation. The possibility that a nation or individual could unilaterally tamper with the globe's climate may seem like the plot of a Hollywood spy thriller but, as the World Economic Forum report notes, it has already happened. In July last year, California businessman Russ George attempted to capture carbon from the air by dumping 100 tons of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean to spawn an artificial plankton bloom. He succeeded in producing a bloom as large as 10,000 sq/km which he hoped would absorb carbon dioxide from the air then sink to the sea bed, allowing him to cash in on lucrative carbon credits. However, his actions may have been in violation of two international agreements. Lab tests have shown that such plankton blooms can pump out neurotoxins, disrupt food chains and alter ecosystems in unexpected ways. Worse still, they can even expedite ocean acidification, which would actually accelerate global warming. David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice. 'The really hard questions here aren’t mostly technical. They’re questions about what kind of planet we want and who we are,' he told Canadian newspaper The Windsor Star. Professor Keith used climate models to suggest that injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic. His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels. 'Decisions involving (solar radiation management) do not need to be reduced to a single ""global thermostat"",' the paper says. His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year. However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest. Open-air and large-scale geoengineering of the kind Professor Keith has suggested has been ruled out by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Such drastic geoengineering could have disastrous unintended effects but could be a viable response to a 'climate emergency' such as the sudden collapse of ice sheets or a killing drought, Professor Keith suggested.","Warning comes from World Economic Forum's Global Risks report .

"By . Anna Sanders . The revolutionary technology behind 3D-printed car parts, food and guns can also be used to print batteries smaller than a grain of sand. Scientists have used a 3D printer to make linthium-ion microbatteries that can fit into tiny devices that had previously stumped engineers looking to power them for longer periods. The batteries were constructed from interlaced stacks of tiny battery electrodes, which conduct electricity, that are each smaller than the width of a single human hair. Scroll down for video . Mini: A research team has developed technology allowing for 3D printed microbatteries with interlaced stacks of electrodes, the electrical conductors in batteries . Scientists from Harvard University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reported the results of their efforts in the journal Advanced Materials. 'Not only did we demonstrate for the first time that we can 3D-print a battery; we demonstrated it in the most rigorous way,' said the senior author of the study, Jennifer A Lewis, according to a press release by Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, where Lewis is a professor. Many engineers have developed miniaturized electronic devices, such as miniscule medical implants, insect-like flying robots and audio and visual recorders that can fit on a pair of glasses. The batteries normally used to power such gadgets were too large, so manufacturers would use ultra-thin films of solid materials to build the electrodes. But these didn't provide enough power. Lewis and her colleagues realized they could pack more energy on a small scale if they could create stacks of interlaced, ultra-thin electrodes built from plane. They knew 3D printing would allow them to precisely build the battery. The team expanded on the functional 'inks' the printer uses, designing some with useful chemical and electrical properties. The inks Lewis' group created had to function as electrochemically active materials, while also being capable of exiting a 3D printer's fine nozzle and hardening in its final form. The ink they developed for the anode part of the battery--or the 'negative' side in a Duracell--is made with nanoparticles of one lithium metal oxide compound. Ink for the cathode--the 'positive' side--was made from another compound. Printed: To create the mini battery, a 3D printer releases special inks that create the batteries' electrodes (red and purple). The interlaced stacks are place in a case and an electrolyte solution is added . The team's 3D printer interlaced stacks of these inks on teeth of tiny gold combs. The team then put it in a container filled with an electrolyte solution to complete the battery. 'The electrochemical performance is comparable to commercial batteries in terms of charge and discharge rate, cycle life and energy densities. We’re just able to achieve this on a much smaller scale,' said the co-author of the study, Shen Dillon, assistant professor at University of Illinois. The founding director of the Wyss Institute lauded the development for its practical applications. 'Jennifer's innovative microbattery ink designs dramatically expand the practical uses of 3D printing, and simultaneously open up entirely new possibilities for miniaturization of all types of devices, both medical and non-medical. It’s tremendously exciting,' said Donald Ingber, who is also a professor of bioengineering at Harvard.","Batteries were constructed from interlaced stacks of tiny electrodes, which conduct electricity, smaller than the width of a human hair .

"By . Damien Gayle . Smell-o-vision has been a staple of bad sci-fi for decades, but could finally be edging closer to the average living room thanks to a super-accurate Japanese system. A team from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in Japan have invented a 'smelling screen' that makes smells waft from the spot on a display that their corresponding objects appear. The development promises to make adverts for fried chicken or fresh coffee even more appealing - or alternatively add an as yet undreamed of realism to documentary programmes like Life of Grime. Smell-o-vision is real! A team at . Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in Japan . has invented a 'smelling screen' that makes smells waft from the spot on a display that their corresponding objects appear . Smell-o-vision is nothing new, having been on the entertainment technology radar for over five decades. The idea made its first widespread appearance with the 1960 film Scent Of Mystery (also known, less puntastically, as Holiday In Spain), which timed odours to specific points in the narrative. The film opened in three specially equipped theatres in in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Unfortunately, the mechanism did not work properly and audience members complained of a hissing noise accompanying the scents - as well as a delay between the actions and their corresponding smells. As a result the film failed miserably, even after the mechanism was fixed. But perhaps it was just an idea whose time had not yet arrived - for the latest Japanese technology seems to promise a new frontier in smell-related multimedia entertainment. The invention is 'a new olfactory display that can generate a localised odour distribution on a two-dimensional display screen,' the researchers say. 'The generated odour distribution is as if an odour source had been placed on the screen, and leads the user to perceive the odour as emanating from a specific region of the screen.' Smell the secret recipe: The system could bring a whole new dimension to, for example, KFC adverts . It works, New Scientist explains, by feeding odours from gel pellets into four air streams situated in each corner of the screen which are blown across the displays surface. Varying the strength and direction of the air-streams using fans moves the scent to any particular spot on the screen, giving the illusion that it is emanating from the digital object displayed. 'The user can freely move his/her head to sniff at various locations on the screen, and can experience realistic changes in the odour intensity with respect to the sniffing location,' the researchers added in a statement. At the moment the system can only make one smell at a time, but the researchers say the next stage is to include a cartridge like those used in printers to allow the smells to be changed more easily. The technology was recently demonstrated the research at the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference in Orlando, Florida. Haruka Matsukura, who led the team that invented the 'smelling screen' suggested that it could be used to enhance advertising hoardings and museum exhibits.","Tokyo team invent a 'smelling screen' that makes smell emanate from the spot on the screen showing their corresponding object .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Scientists are appealing to the public to help track down a giant slug which has been invading Britain from Spain. The Spanish slug is thought to have arrived here on salad leaves but has bred rapidly - laying up to 400 eggs each - threatening British crops. The invasion has been slowed by frosts . in May which killed thousands of them, but scientists are so concerned . they have launched slugwatch.co.uk and are asking the public to help track them. The Spanish slug, pictured, is invading Britain threatening crops and native species. They can grow up to 6in long and produce 400 eggs each . The pests eat dead animals, excrement and even their own species. They can grow up to 6in long, lay 400 eggs each, eat crops usually spared by our native slugs and can survive poison pellets. The SlugWatch website contains . information on how to trap the animals and print out kits which help . identify them and has been launched to coincide with UK Biology Week. The biggest fear is that they will breed with native slugs, giving them a greater resistance to cold weather while keeping their keen appetite. When the species first appeared in Scandinavia a few years ago they bred so quickly that squashed slugs on roads caused serious traffic problems. The species was first spotted in the UK in 2012 by Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre. He counted 350 of them in just one day and when he saw some eating a dead mouse he decided to send samples for identification. The species turned out to be Arion vulgaris, otherwise known as the Spanish slug. They are thought to have travelled here on imported trees, pot plants or salad leaves. In an interview with The Observer Dr Bedford said: 'The Spanish slug is a voracious predator that can survive eating many of the slug pellets that are supposed to kill them. The slugs eat crops which are usually left untouched by native species and have so far only been stopped by the cold weather . 'We want photos and sightings from members of the public to help build a picture of how widespread the Spanish slug is.' Most slugs play an important part in the ecosystem and of the 30 species in the UK only four are classed as pests. The majority of slugs actually live underground and the ones which can be seen feeding on the surface make up less than 5 per cent of the population. The gastropods can move up to 16 feet per night and can detect food from 23 inches away. Spanish slugs vary in colour from bright orange to rusty brown and can be identified by their high numbers and odd diet which also includes excrement.","Spanish slugs can grow up to 6in and produce 400 eggs each .

"By . Damien Gayle . Campaigners today warned of a 'seismic shift' in privacy invasion after it emerged that Intel was the latest company set to market a television set-top box equipped with a camera that stares back at viewers. The company, which makes the microchips found inside most personal computers, has launched an entirely new division, Intel Media, to make and market the Orwellian streaming-television product. Erik Huggers (pictured), vice-president of Intel Media, said the new service would offer users a TV 'that is much more personal, that learns about you, that actually cares about who you are.' 'TV that actually cares': Erik Huggers, vice president of the new Intel Media division of the microchip maker, defended the product against privacy concerns in an interview at AllThingsD's Dive Into Media conference . The camera, Intel claims, will enable . them to personalise the interactive features of their product, so that . different members of the same household can be served programming and . advertising specific to them. Intel is only the latest company to develop a television product that contains a camera and sensors designed to watch what viewers are up to. U.S. cable provider Verizon sparked outrage in December when it applied to patent a set-top box technology that can observe what's going on in the room and show viewers adverts based on what it detects . In U.S. Patent Application 20120304206 the company suggests it could detect when people are 'cuddling' then show 'a commercial for a romantic getaway vacation, a commercial for a contraceptive, a commercial for flowers [...] etc.'. Microsoft also recently registered a patent for technology to allow its Kinect motion sensor to figure out how many people are in front of it then stop playback if it detected more people than the copyright terms allowed. Google TV proposed a similar patent that would use video and audio recording devices to do the same. And Comcast in 2008 patented a monitoring technology that would recommend content to users based on people it recognised in the room. The surge in products that look back at you will no doubt spark associations with George Orwell's dystopian classic Nineteen Eighty-Four, in which an oppressed population live in fear of surveillance through two-way 'telescreens'. The book's hero, Winston Smith, is only able to keep a diary - a banned activity - because one corner of his old-fashioned flat is out of the view of the telescreen's camera. John Hurt as Winston Smith in the film Nineteen Eighty Four: The hero of the story, Smith is only able to keep a diary because one corner of his flat is out of the view of his televisions integral surveillance camera . Erik Huggers, vice-president of Intel Media, spoke to AllThingsD's Dive Into Media conference this week, where he gave official confirmation of Intel's long-rumoured entry into the telescreen market. He said: 'This thing looks like a leap in time of 10-20 years compared to what you have today, that is much more personal, that learns about you, that actually cares about who you are.' He added: 'We think there's real value in the ability to actually identify the various users. Today television doesn't really know anything about you and it's the same television service for everyone in the household.' Challenged about the privacy implications surrounding a television service which is designed to look back at the viewer, he said: 'We think there's real value in the ability to actually identify the various users. 'Today television doesn't really know anything about you and it's the same television service for everyone in the household.' Intel's new set-top box product is not the first technology that encroaches on the privacy of families' living rooms.

Google TV proposed a similar patent that would use video and audio recording devices to do the same. And Comcast in 2008 patented a monitoring technology that would recommend content to users based on people it recognised in the room. Samsung's . Smart TV already comes equipped with cameras and microphones, although . they are not linked to a system which delivers personalised content. Dutch-born Mr Huggers gave a personal example drawn from his own family life, where his children's use of his Netflix account means that when he and his wife use it the service often suggests cartoons for them to watch. 'My kids may watch programming geared toward them, and I’ll watch programming geared toward me,' he said. 'If there’s a way to distinguish who is watching what, advertisers can then target ads at the proper parties.' He also promised that the final product would ship with a 'shutter' over its camera's lens, allowing users fearful of being watched to block its view. Privacy campaigners nevertheless reacted with horror to the product, which Intel intends to sell directly to the public as soon as later this year. Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'The idea that your television is watching you as you watch is a seismic shift in privacy protection. 'This is data collection solely for commercial purposes and most people won’t realise that this is even happening. 'It highlights why proper regulation is essential so companies aren’t free to scan and search your living room – or wherever you have a TV – to record more information on who is watching. 'At least this camera will have a physical way of blocking it, but with a range of smart televisions there is no way to block the in-built camera and microphones. 'Given the widespread concerns about these devices being hacked over the internet, they could well end up being Orwell’s telescreens controlled by strangers with a laptop.'","Microchip maker launches new division to market streaming-TV product .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Massive alien worlds, known as ‘super-Earths’, could be more like our own planet than first thought. Scientists now suggest that tectonically active super-Earths store most of their water in the mantle- the rocky part that makes up most of the volume and mass of the planet. If this model proves to be true, it could mean that our galaxy is home to giant worlds that have a stable climate similar to Earth with potential to harbour life. Super-Earths are giant planets that have between one and 10 times the mass of our world. About 40 per cent of all red dwarf stars - the most common stars in our galaxy - have a super-Earth orbiting in the habitable zone . Super-Earths are giant planets that have between one and 10 times the mass of our world. About 40 per cent of all red dwarf stars – the most common stars in our galaxy - have a super-Earth orbiting in the habitable zone where liquid water can exist on the surface of the planet. ‘Super-Earths are expected to have deep oceans that will overflow their basins and inundate the entire surface, but we show this logic to be flawed,’ said Nicolas Cowan, at Northwestern University in Illinois. ‘Terrestrial planets have significant amounts of water in their interior. Super-Earths are likely to have shallow oceans to go along with their shallow ocean basins.’ Scientists suggest that tectonically active super-Earths store most of their water in the mantle- the rocky part that makes up most of the volume and mass of the planet.

In their model, the researchers treated the intriguing exoplanets like Earth, which has water in its mantle - the rocky part that makes up most of the volume and mass of the planet. The rock of the mantle contains tiny amounts of water, which quickly adds up because the mantle is so large. Because of this, deep water cycle moves water between oceans and the mantle. Water is constantly traded back and forth between the ocean and the rocky mantle because of plate tectonics, the researchers said. The division of water between ocean and mantle is controlled by seafloor pressure, which is proportional to gravity. Accounting for the effects of seafloor pressure and high gravity are two novel factors in their model. As the size of the super-Earths increase, gravity and seafloor pressure also go up. ‘We can put 80 times more water on a super-Earth and still have its surface look like Earth,’ Professor Cowan said. ‘These massive planets have enormous seafloor pressure, and this force pushes water into the mantle.’ And it doesn’t take that much water to tip a planet into being a water world, the researchers said. ‘If Earth was one per cent water by mass, we’d all drown, regardless of the deep water cycle,’ Professor Cowan said. The first super-Earths were discovered by Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail in 1992. In April 2007, a team in Switzerland announced the discovery of two new super-Earths around Gliese 581 (pictured on the right) ‘The surface would be covered in water. Whether or not you have deep water cycle really matters for planets that are one one-thousandth or one ten-thousandth water.’ Professor Cowan admits that there are two major uncertainties in his model: that super-Earths have plate tectonics and the amount of water Earth stores in its mantle. ‘These are the two things we would like to know better to improve our model,’ he added. ‘Our model is a shot from the hip, but it’s an important step in advancing how we think about super-Earths.’ In the study 'Superhabitable Worlds', Professor Heller proposes that tidal heating can create conditions where life could emerge on an icy or terrestrial planet once thought to be uninhabitable. Pictured is an artist's impression of an exoplanet . Last week, researchers in Scotland said that Earth-sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought. This means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface. Academics at the University of Aberdeen and University of St Andrews claim the definition of the ‘Goldilocks’ zone -  the area of space around a star, or sun, which can support life – is flawed.They argue this definition fails to take into account life that can exist beneath a planet’s surface. ‘As you get deeper below a planet’s surface, the temperature increases, and once you get down to a temperature where liquid water can exist – life can exist there too,’ said Aberdeen University PhD student Sean McMahon. In a galaxy of 200 billion stars of various types, scientists estimate there are 11 billion potentially habitable planets in the Goldilocks zone as it is currently defined. Factor in smaller, dimmer red dwarf stars, and the number of planets with mild temperatures similar to Earth rises to 40 billion.","Super-Earth's are giant planets with up to 10 times the mass of our world .

Now, more than 20 years after the 1991 film Terminator 2 was released, Spanish scientists claim to have developed the world's first self-healing polymer that can spontaneously rebuild. The new material has been labelled ‘Terminator’ by researchers, who say it could help improve the lifetime and security of plastic parts in anything from electrical components to houses.

Impressive: The researchers from the Centre for Electrochemical Technologies said that after being cut in two and the pieces pushed back together, one sample 97 per cent healed in two hours . The discovery - revealed in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s journal Materials Horizons - was hailed as the first polymer that restores itself without intervention, reported United Press International. The researchers from the Centre for Electrochemical Technologies in San Sebastian said that after being cut in two and the pieces pushed back together, one sample 97 per cent healed in two hours. The single piece was unbreakable when stretched by hand, according to scientists Alaitz Rekondo, Roberto Martin, Alaitz Ruiz de Luzuriaga, German Cabanero, Hans Grande and Ibon Odriozola. They said: ‘Such a material presents near quantitative self-healing efficiency at room-temperature, without the need for any external intervention such as heat or light.’ Video courtesy of Chemistry World .

Stoke . Stoke will assess the condition of forward Mame Biram Diouf ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Leicester at the Britannia Stadium. Since scoring the Potters' winner in their shock victory at Manchester City on August 30, Diouf has been away on international duty with Senegal and had not been back in training with his club by Friday. Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf scored a shock winner for Stoke in their 1-0 victory at Manchester City . Winger Oussama Assaidi is in contention to make his 'second debut' after rejoining the Staffordshire outfit on another season-long loan deal from Liverpool on transfer deadline day. But midfielder Stephen Ireland (rib) looks set to miss out along with Geoff Cameron (hernia) and Peter Odemwingie (knee), both of whom have undergone surgery. Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Bardsley, Pieters, Huth, Muniesa, Wilson, Shawcross, Teixeira, Wilkinson, Whelan, Palacios, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Walters, Arnautovic, Diouf, Bojan, Crouch, Moses. Leicester . A trio of new signings come into the reckoning for Leicester manager Nigel Pearson ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League clash with Stoke on Saturday. Defender Danny Simpson, along with strikers Tom Lawrence and Nick Powell - the latter on loan from Manchester United - are added to the squad for the game at the Britannia Stadium. Promising youngster Tom Lawrence has arrived at Leicester from Manchester United on a permanent basis . Defender Matthew Upson (foot) remains sidelined, and although Matty James is training again after a lay-off with a shin injury, the game comes too soon for the midfielder. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, Drinkwater, Cambiasso, Simpson, Powell, Lawrence. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) The Potters are unbeaten in five home meetings with Leicester in all competitions (W4 D1). Indeed, none of the last 10 clashes between the Potters and the Foxes have been won by the away side (six home wins, four draws). Leicester City are without a clean sheet in 11 Premier League games; the longest run of any current top-flight side. Since the start of last season, only Chelsea (2) and Liverpool (5) have scored more than once against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke are unbeaten in their last five home meetings with Leicester, not losing since James Scowcroft scored the only goal for the Foxes in an August 2002 second tier clash . The Potters, who lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on the opening day, have not lost consecutive home league games since April 2013. Nigel Pearson’s side have scored in 33 of their last 34 league games, failing only to net against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Indeed, that 2-0 defeat at Chelsea was Leicester’s first away defeat this calendar year (W8 D4). The Foxes have blocked 25 opposition shots so far this season; at least 10 more than any other team in the Premier League. Stoke are the only Premier League side yet to net in the first-half in 2014-15. Leicester new boy Nick Powell currently has the best min/goal ratio of any player in Premier League history, having scored once in 29 minutes of top-flight football.","Stoke to assess fitness of Mame Biram Diouf .

"By . Liam Blackburn, Press Association . Burnley's Sean Dyche is grateful for the admiration Neil Warnock has shown him during his time as a manager, but insists there will be no 'love-in' when two winless sides meet at Crystal Palace. Warnock revealed last season that he voted for Dyche to be the LMA Manager of the Year - over the likes of Tony Pulis and Brendan Rodgers - for his efforts in guiding the unfancied Clarets into the Premier League. The 65-year-old had also called to offer support to Dyche during the lowest ebb of his fledging career when he was sacked by Watford in the summer of 2012. Sean Dyche is grateful for Neil Warnock's kind words but his mind is only on one thing when the two teams meet in the Premier League this weekend . Neil Warnock, pictured celebrating Crystal Palace's last gasp equaliser at Newcastle, holds Sean Dyche in very high regard . But while there is clearly a mutual respect between the two men who will line up in opposite dugouts at Selhurst Park this weekend, the need for a first top-flight win of the season will be Dyche's sole focus. 'He's someone who has shown me an awful lot of respect,' Dyche said of Warnock. 'I know him a little bit and he's always spoken well of myself as a young manager and I do thank him for that because his record speaks for itself at the varying clubs he's had. 'I thought he had chosen the time to say 'no, that's it, I'll go and enjoy the family' - but he's obviously got the bug again which happens in football. It's a great game, that's why we all love it, and he certainly loves it. 'Make no mistake, there will be no love-in when the whistle blows with Neil; he wants his team to perform and so do I.' Dyche has the chance to blood his three deadline day signings in this fixture after George Boyd, Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane all arrived at Turf Moor to swell one of the thinnest squads in the entire division. Providing adequate competition for places was always going to be a challenge for the Clarets following a season in which they rarely changed their line-up from week to week, but Dyche is happy that nobody can now be assured of a starting berth. 'We are happy with the business we've done,' added Dyche. Sean Dyche greets Jose Mourinho when Burnley met Chelsea in their opening league game of the season . 'It rounds the group off in a nice way. We've got demand more or less all over the pitch, there's no safety net for players wondering about their shirt and we wanted that. 'It is hard for clubs like ourselves because we can't carry vast squads, and we probably wouldn't wish to, but when the window shuts, it is shut. There's no loans or anything like that so it means you do have to have a deeper squad.' Boyd is the only one of the trio who may start at Palace, though, as Chalobah and Keane only trained with their new team-mates for the first time on Thursday after being away with England Under-21s. In the Clarets' last outing two weeks ago they earned a credible point in a 0-0 draw with a Manchester United team featuring Angel di Maria for the first time. And Dyche is hopeful that holding the 20-time domestic champions to a stalemate will reinforce the idea that his team are capable of getting results in the Premier League. 'There is a good belief there anyway but I think results like that and performances help,' he argued. 'I felt we handled that well and tactically delivered a good performance against a very strong group of players. 'This idea of a work in progress at Manchester United is true, but if you look at the names on the team-sheet it's still a very good group of players. I think it enhances the belief in the players; I think the belief is there but it just continues to build it.'","Neil Warnock revealed that he voted for the Burnley boss to be LMA Manager of the Year last season over the likes of Tony Pulis and Brendan Rodgers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They look for all the world like a collection of flowers bursting into life. Yet in fact, these are microscopic crystals grown in a Harvard laboratory. Measuring just microns across, they were created to assemble themselves a molecule at a time. The researchers have created a variety of structures resembling different flowers . To create the flower structures, Noorduin and his colleagues dissolve . barium chloride (a salt) and sodium silicate (also known as waterglass) into a beaker of water. Carbon dioxide from air naturally dissolves in . the water, setting off a reaction which precipitates barium carbonate . crystals. As a byproduct, it also lowers the pH of the solution . immediately surrounding the crystals, which then triggers a reaction . with the dissolved waterglass. This second reaction adds a layer of . silica to the growing structures, uses up the acid from the solution, . and allows the formation of barium carbonate crystals to continue. The team say the work, carried out on glass slides, is able to control the process of crystal growth so precisely it can create curved and delicate shapes, that don't resemble the cubic or jagged forms normally associated with crystals. 'Rather, fields of carnations and marigolds seem to bloom from the surface of a submerged glass slide, assembling themselves a molecule at a time,' the team say. 'For at least 200 years, people have . been intrigued by how complex shapes could have evolved in nature. 'This . work helps to demonstrate what's possible just through environmental, . chemical changes,' said Wim L. Noorduin of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and . lead author of the paper in the journal Science. By simply manipulating chemical gradients in a beaker of flui the team was able to create different 'flowers'. The shape of the crystals depends on a reaction of compounds that are diffusing through a liquid solution. The crystals grow toward or away from certain chemical gradients as the pH of the reaction shifts back and forth. The conditions of the reaction dictate whether the structure resembles broad, radiating leaves, a thin stem, or a rosette of petals, the team say. A red coral on top of a green spiral created on a glass slide by the team . Bluebells in the lab: The researchers can controls the crystals to produce leafs and stem shapes . 'It is not unusual for chemical gradients to influence growth in nature; for example, delicately curved marine shells form from calcium carbonate under water, and gradients of signaling molecules in a human embryo help set up the plan for the body,' they say. 'You can really collaborate with the self-assembly process,' says Noorduin. 'The precipitation happens . spontaneously, but if you want to change something then you can just . manipulate the conditions of the reaction and sculpt the forms while . they're growing.' Increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide, for instance, helps to create 'broad-leafed' structures. Reversing the pH gradient at the right moment can create curved, ruffled structures. Noorduin and his colleagues have . grown the crystals on glass slides and metal blades; they've even grown a . field of flowers in front of President Lincoln's seat on a one-cent . coin.

'When you look through the electron . microscope, it really feels a bit like you're diving in the ocean, . seeing huge fields of coral and sponges,' describes Noorduin. 'Sometimes I forget to take images because it's so nice to explore.' Harvard biologist Howard Berg has shown that bacteria living in colonies can sense and react to plumes of chemicals from one another, which causes them to grow, as a colony, into intricate geometric patterns. Replicating this type of effect in the laboratory was a matter of identifying a suitable chemical reaction and testing, again and again, how variables like the pH, temperature, and exposure to air might affect the nanoscale structures.

"By . Mark Prigg . The bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago. Now, astronomers believe they may have solved one of its biggest mysteries by working out how it operates - and discovering the rotation period of Saturn in the process. The giant storm operates rather like the jet stream on Earth they say - explaining why it never appears to move. Scroll down for video and animations... The animation above shows a view from directly over Saturn's north pole, keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon. The mysterious six-sided hexagon on Saturn’s North Pole has long captivated astronomers is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers). The hexagon is made of a band of . upper-atmospheric winds which creates its six-sided shape. A polar . cyclone can be seen at its centre. First seen by Voyagers 1 and 2 over 30 years ago the hexagon it thought to be fixed with Saturn’s rotation. Last year, the Cassini spacecraft . provided scientists with the first close-up, visible-light views of a . behemoth hurricane swirling within the hexagon. Thin, . bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane were estimated to be . travelling at around 330 mph (150 metres per second). The unusual structure with a hexagonal shape surrounding Saturn's north pole was spotted on the planet for the first time thirty years ago. The hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across - more than twice the diameter of Earth. Nothing similar with such a regular geometry had ever been seen on any planet in the Solar System. The Planetary Sciences Group has now been able to study and measure the phenomenon and, establish its rotation period, and that of Saturn - the only planet in the Solar System whose rotation time remains unknown. Researchers found seasonal variations do not affect the hexagon and its jet stream at all, so concluded both are part of an extensive wave, deeply rooted in Saturn's atmosphere. The UPV/EHU researchers suggest that the hexagon and its stream are the manifestation of a 'Rossby wave' similar to those that form in the mid-latitudes of the earth. On our planet the jet stream meanders from west to east and brings, associated with it, the system of areas of low pressure and anticyclones which we have been seeing regularly on weather maps. On Saturn, a hydrogen gas planet, ten times the size of the Earth, cold in its upper clouds, without a solid surface, and with an atmosphere as deep as that of an ocean, 'the hexagonal wavy motion of the jet stream is expected to be propagated vertically and reveal to us aspects of the planet’s hidden atmosphere,' said Agustín Sánchez-Lavega, Head of the Planetary Sciences research group. Saturn's storm in action: Scientists have announced a breakthrough in understand how the storm is created . 'The movement of the hexagon could therefore be linked to the depths of Saturn, and the rotation period of this structure, which, as we have been able to ascertain, is 10 hours, 39 minutes and 23 seconds, could be that of the planet itself,' he added. Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System whose rotation period is not yet known. Due to the tilt of approximately 27º of the planet Saturn, its polar atmosphere undergoes intense seasonable variations with long polar nights lasting over seven years, followed by a long period of 23 years of variable illumination. In 1980 and 1981 NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 space probes passed for the first time over the planet Saturn, located 1,500 million km from the Sun. Among their numerous discoveries they observed a strange, hexagon-shaped structure in the planet’s uppermost clouds surrounding its north pole. The new analysis allowed astronomers to track the hexagonal storm for the first time to see how it rotated, and work out how it was formed . The hexagon remained virtually static, and images captured by the Voyager probes found that the clouds were moving rapidly inside the hexagon in an enclosed jet stream and were being dragged by winds travelling at over 400 km/h. Thirty years later –the equivalent of one Saturn year, in other words, the time the planet takes to go all the way around the Sun– and over more than six consecutive years, researchers in the UPV/EHU’s Planetary Sciences Group, in collaboration with astronomers from various countries, were able to observe Saturn's northern polar region in detail once again and confirmed that the hexagon continued in place. After measuring the positions of the hexagon vertices with great precision, they determined that its movement remains extremely stable, and on the basis of the cloud movements, that the jet stream inside it remains unchanged. It comes just months after footage captured by the Cassini spacecraft using colour filters, showed researchers a complete view of the top of Saturn for the first time. ‘A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades - and who knows - maybe centuries,’ said Andrew Ingersoll, at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. This animation above shows a view from directly over the north pole, keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon. This older, colour composite image - showing false shades - has been created from raw images taken by Cassini from a distance of 379,268 miles away . Weather patterns on Earth are interrupted when they encounter friction from land forms. Scientists suspect the stability of the . hexagon has something to do with the lack of solid land forms on Saturn, . which is essentially a giant ball of gas. Better views of the hexagon are available now because the sun began to illuminate its interior in late 2012. Cassini captured images of the hexagon over a 10-hour time span with high-resolution cameras, giving scientists a good look at the motion of cloud structures within. Scientists saw the storm around the pole, as well as small vortices rotating in the opposite direction of the hexagon. Some of the vortices are swept along with the jet stream as if on a racetrack. The largest of these vortices spans about 2,200 miles (3,500 km), or about twice the size of the largest hurricane recorded on Earth. The footage captured by the Cassini spacecraft is the first of its kind, using colour filters, to show a complete view of the top of Saturn . Scientists analysed these images in false colour, a rendering method that made it easier to distinguish differences among the types of particles suspended in the atmosphere inside and outside the hexagon. ‘Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,’ said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University in Virginia. ‘The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth's Antarctic ozone hole.’ The Antarctic ozone hole forms within a region enclosed by a jet stream with similarities to the hexagon. Wintertime . conditions enable ozone-destroying chemical processes to occur and the . jet stream prevents a resupply of ozone from the outside. At Saturn, large aerosols cannot cross . into the hexagonal jet stream from outside and large aerosol particles . are created when sunlight shines on the atmosphere. Only . recently, with the start of Saturn's northern spring in August 2009, . did sunlight begin bathing the planet's northern hemisphere. ‘As . we approach Saturn's summer solstice in 2017, lighting conditions over . its north pole will improve, and we are excited to track the changes . that occur both inside and outside the hexagon boundary,’ said Scott . Edgington, Cassini deputy project scientist.","Storm on Saturn's north pole rages with winds of 200mph .

"By . Leon Watson . and Larisa Brown . The annoying whirr of windscreen wipers may soon be a thing of the past. McLaren is designing a sports car that uses a system adapted from fighter jets to keep a driver’s vision clear in bad weather without the need for blades. It is believed to involve high-frequency sound waves similar to those used by dentists for removing plaque from patients’ teeth. The Formula One firm, based in Surrey, is developing the method for its new supercar, expected to roll off the production line in 2015. Wave goodbye: A new wiper-free windscreen is being developed which will mean drivers will no longer have to face the problem of wipers sticking to windscreens in cold weather . F1 car maker McLaren is remaining tight-lipped on the plans and refusing to reveal how the system will work because it says rivals may steal the idea. However, experts suggest it may make use of ultrasound to create tiny vibrations on the screen which would bounce off rain, insects and mud. It would also improve visibility and prevent the problem drivers face when wiper blades freeze to the glass in cold weather. The Woking-based firm's chief designer Frank Stephenson told The Sunday Times that the system was already being used by the military. 'It took a lot of effort to get this out of a source in the military. I asked why you don't see wipers on some aircraft on when they are coming in at very low levels for landing. 'I was told that it's not a coating on the surface but a high frequency electronic system that never fails and is constantly active. Nothing will attach to the windscreen.' The system is expected to be introduced to McLaren's range of sportscars which cost between £170,000 and £870,000, but once perfected could be produced for the mass market for as little as £10. Paul Wilcox, professor of ultrasonics at Bristol University's faculty of engineering, told The Sunday Times: 'The obvious way of doing it is to have an ultrasonic transducer in the corner of the windscreen that would excite waves at around 30kHz to bounce across the windscreen.' Windscreen wipers were invented in by the American property developer Mary Anderson who received a patent for her window cleaning device in 1903. The invention came about during a trip to New York City. It was raining heavily and Mrs Anderson noticed that drivers had to open the windows of their cars in order to see out of them. She wanted to find a solution and invented a swinging arm device with a rubber blade that was operated by the driver from within the vehicle using a lever. At first the invention was highly critiqued as many claimed that the device would actually distract drivers, but by 1916 windscreen wipers had become standard on most vehicles .

Jason Rourke, 42, spent 10 days building the super-strong mountain bike which cost a total of £5,000. Motorcycle racer Guy Martin commissioned Mr Rourke to make the bike which he pedalled into the record books at 112.94mph (181km/h) earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Daredevil cyclist Guy Martin  (pictured) commissioned bicycle shop owner  Jason Rourke to make the super pushbike (also pictured) which he has since pedalled into the record books at 112mph (177km/h) Mr Martin broke the previous record set by Dutch cyclist Sebastiaan Bowier who reached 83.13mph (133.78 km/h) on a pushbike in September this year. In order to break the record Mr Martin was towed at 50mph on Pendine Sands in South Wales, before being released where he hit just under 113mph (around 180km/h). Speedy: Mr Rourke, 42, spent 10 days and £5,000 building the 22lb super-strong mountain bike (pictured) The record breaking attempt features in a new Channel 4 series called 'Speed' which began last night. All the bike's materials, except the tyres, were sourced from the UK . The vehicle has just one gear which allows the bike go up to 130mph . It uses Continental laminated tyres . The bike is made up of two aluminium wheel frames one tailor-made lightweight steel frame measuring 22inches x 22 inches (56cm x 56cm). The entire bike weighs 22lbs (10kg) Mr Rourke, who runs Brian Rourke Cycles in Burslem in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'The funny thing is, my dad Brian was contacted by the people who set the current world record asking if we could help to build the bike. 'Due to various work commitments we didn't take it on, so when we got a call from the producers in February about another attempt to break the record, we couldn't say ""no"". 'I made the bike in the workshop over 10 days and welded the steel frame together and brazed it as well. 'It wasn't a particularly light bike . because that's not what we were focusing on. We needed to make sure it . was strong and the tyres actually were quite thick as we needed extra . tread to grip with. Resilient: Mr Martin broke the previous record set by Dutch cyclist Sebastiaan Bowier, who reached 83.13mph on a pushbike in September this year . 'Because all the components have been tailor-made, the bike is almost priceless because companies might never . agree to make them. 'But the price to construct the bike came to roughly £5,000.' 'The fact that we got to work with Guy Martin was incredible. He is someone I have always found interesting having seen a lot of his programmes. 'He came along to our workshop in Burslem with the TV crew so he could get measured up for the bike, and he even helped me to make it.' Former British Truck Racing Championship winner Dave Jenkins, 38, was also enlisted to help in the record-breaking bid. He . said: 'I got a call out of the blue one day from a researcher asking if .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is involved in 'tense talks' with major record labels to offer albums from major artists as iTunes exclusives. It is claimed the firm has been locked in talks with label bosses following the huge success of Beyonce's self titled album. Featuring 14 songs and 17 videos, it debuted on iTunes a week before it arrived on streaming services and YouTube - and brought record 800,000 sales in the first three days and over one million in the first week. Apple has been locked in secret talks with label bosses following the huge success of Beyonce's self titled album. Now Apple hopes to replicate the deal with other artists. Billboard claims Apple iTunes director Robert Kondrk engaged in 'tense talks' with record label executives during Grammys week with a mission to secure more exclusive sales windows. 'The iTunes theory was that because of the easy availability to access albums on YouTube it has punctured sales globally for track and albums,' a major label executive told Billboard. Apple's move comes as digital music sales fell 5.7 per cent in 2013 as users switch to streaming services such as Spotify. According to the LA Times, music industry insiders said Apple is pushing for a new release window — similar to the one that some Hollywood studios impose for films newly released for home viewing. 'These are really changing times, and I think everybody's going to be trying different things, whether it's iTunes, Spotify or the labels,' Irving Azoff, manager of the Eagles, Christina Aguilera and other acts, told the paper. Apple has a history of digital exlusives. In 2010 it struck a deal with the record label EMI and the Beatles' company Apple Corps to sell digital downloads of the legendary rock band's music on iTunes. 'It's kind of up for grabs.' Apple already has 80 percent of download sales in the U.S. However, overall, song downloads began to slump last year, and are now down about 12 percent through the first eight weeks of 2014, according to Nielsen SoundScan data. The decline is attributed to several factors, including streaming music services like Spotify and recently launched Beats Music. Streaming services such as Spotify are believed to have eaten into Apple's sales . According Nielson, 48% of smartphone owners use their portable devices every day to listen to streaming music, as opposed to 42% who use them for downloading music. Another rap act relied heavily on streaming to build awareness for a forthcoming release — and debuted at the top of Billboard's album chart last week. Schoolboy Q's ""Oxymoron,"" was heavily promoted on Spotify, and sold nearly 139,000 copies in its first week, after . Spotify users in the U.S. had listened to 3.3 million streams in the months ahead of the album debut . 'It's not a great strategy to try to dictate how people consume music when they're clearly asking for and in fact doing something different on a wide scale,' said Spotify Chief Content Officer Ken Parks. 'It just doesn't work for anyone.'","Firm in 'tense talks' with labels to offer albums before its rivals .

"By . Mark Prigg . An inscription on a 3,500-year-old stone block from Egypt may be one of the world's oldest weather reports -and could provide new evidence about the reign of pharaoh Ahmose, the first pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty (pictured) An inscription on a 3,500-year-old stone block from Egypt that could be one of the world’s oldest weather reports could help rewrite the history of a Pharoah. A new translation of a 40-line inscription on the 6-foot-tall calcite block called the Tempest Stela describes rain, darkness and 'the sky being in storm without cessation, louder than the cries of the masses.' Two scholars at the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute believe the unusual weather patterns described on the slab were the result of a massive volcano explosion at Thera—the present-day island of Santorini in the Mediterranean Sea. Because volcano eruptions can have a widespread impact on weather, the Thera explosion likely would have caused significant disruptions in Egypt. The new translation suggests the Egyptian pharaoh Ahmose ruled at a time closer to the Thera eruption than previously thought—a finding that could change scholars’ understanding of a critical juncture in human history as Bronze Age empires realigned. The research from the Oriental Institute’s Nadine Moeller and Robert Ritner appears in the spring issue of the Journal of Near Eastern Studies. The Tempest Stela dates back to the reign of the pharaoh Ahmose, the first pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty. His rule marked the beginning of the New Kingdom, a time when Egypt’s power reached its height. The block was found in pieces in Thebes, modern Luxor, where Ahmose ruled. If the stela does describe the aftermath of the Thera catastrophe, the correct dating of the stela itself and Ahmose’s reign, currently thought to be about 1550 B.C., could actually be 30 to 50 years earlier. 'This is important to scholars of the ancient Near East and eastern Mediterranean, generally because the chronology that archaeologists use is based on the lists of Egyptian pharaohs, and this new information could adjust those dates,' said Moeller, assistant professor of Egyptian archaeology at the Oriental Institute, who specializes in research on ancient urbanism and chronology. Because volcano eruptions can have a widespread impact on weather, the Thera explosion likely would have caused significant disruptions in Egypt, researchers believe. Marina Baldi, a scientist in climatology and meteorology at the Institute of Biometeorology of the National Research Council in Italy, has analyzed the information on the stela along with her colleagues and compared it to known weather patterns in Egypt. A dominant weather pattern in the area is a system called 'the Red Sea Trough,' which brings hot, dry air to the area from East Africa. When disrupted, that system can bring severe weather, heavy precipitation and flash flooding, similar to what is reported on the Tempest Stela. 'A modification in the atmospheric circulation after the eruption could have driven a change in the precipitation regime of the region. 'Therefore the episode in the Tempest Stela could be a consequence of these climatological changes,' Baldi explained. In 2006, radiocarbon testing of an olive tree buried under volcanic residue placed the date of the Thera eruption at 1621-1605 B.C. Until now, the archeological evidence for the date of the Thera eruption seemed at odds with the radiocarbon dating, explained Oriental Institute postdoctoral scholar Felix Hoeflmayer, who has studied the chronological implications related to the eruption. However, if the date of Ahmose’s reign is earlier than previously believed, the resulting shift in chronology “might solve the whole problem,” Hoeflmayer said. The revised dating of Ahmose’s reign could mean the dates of other events in the ancient Near East fit together more logically, scholars said. For example, it realigns the dates of important events such as the fall of the power of the Canaanites and the collapse of the Babylonian Empire, said David Schloen, associate professor in the Oriental Institute and Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations on ancient cultures in the Middle East. 'This new information would provide a better understanding of the role of the environment in the development and destruction of empires in the ancient Middle East,' he said. For example, the new chronology helps to explain how Ahmose rose to power and supplanted the Canaanite rulers of Egypt—the Hyksos—according to Schloen. The Thera eruption and resulting tsunami would have destroyed the Hyksos’ ports and significantly weakened their sea power. In addition, the disruption to trade and agriculture caused by the eruption would have undermined the power of the Babylonian Empire and could explain why the Babylonians were unable to fend off an invasion of the Hittites, another ancient culture that flourished in what is now Turkey. Some researchers consider the text on the Tempest Stela to be a metaphorical document that described the impact of the Hyksos invasion. The block was found in pieces in Thebes, modern Luxor (pictured), where Ahmose ruled. However, Ritner’s translation shows that the text was more likely a description of weather events consistent with the disruption caused by the massive Thera explosion. Ritner said the text reports that Ahmose witnessed the disaster—the description of events in the stela text is frightening. The stela’s text describes the “sky being in storm” with “a tempest of rain” for a period of days. The passages also describe bodies floating down the Nile like “skiffs of papyrus.” Importantly, the text refers to events affecting both the delta region and the area of Egypt further south along the Nile. “This was clearly a major storm, and different from the kinds of heavy rains that Egypt periodically receives,” Ritner said. In addition to the Tempest Stela, a text known as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus from the reign of Ahmose also makes a special point of mentioning thunder and rain, “which is further proof that the scholars under Ahmose paid close and particular attention to matters of weather,” Ritner said. Other work is underway to get a clearer idea of accurate dating around the time of Ahmose, who ruled after the Second Intermediate period when the Hyksos people seized power in Egypt. That work also has pushed back the dates of his reign closer to the explosion on Thera, Moeller explained.","Inscription tells of a 'tempest of rain believed to have followed a volcanic eruption .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . People go house hunting with specific criteria in mind – from a certain number of bedrooms or a country-style kitchen to a spacious garden with room for a trampoline. But few are likely to specify that they must have a hidden spaceship inside their home.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . People often think they might have valuable odds and ends lying around the house. But one lucky unsuspecting punter was left stunned when her earrings were found to contain an incredibly rare pearl. And it could reach up to a quarter of a million pounds when it goes up for auction. Jewellery expert Marielle Whiting examines the huge natural round pearl, which was discovered after an unsuspecting punter took an old pair of earrings into Woolley and Wallis auctioneers in Salisbury, Wiltshire . Experts were examining a pair of pearl earrings brought in to them by a man whose wife had worn them for years when they spotted the beautiful jewel. They suspected it was a natural pearl rather than a more common cultured one and sent the precious gem to scientists in London and then Switzerland. X-rays confirmed it was a large, natural pearl with a diameter of 0.7 inches (17.4 millimeters). The 33.14 carat round pearl was produced by a gold lip oyster - Pinctada maxima in Latin - and would have taken around 10 years to develop in the wild. It has been given a pre-sale estimate of £120,000 ($200,000; €145,000) by auctioneers Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, Wiltshire. It is the largest of its type to ever go up for auction and it is thought that it could exceed the estimate and reach £250,000 ($420,000; €300,000). Expert Jonathan Edwards realised that what was thought to be a relatively valueless cultured pearl may actually be an enormous natural one and immediately sent it off to experts in Switzerland to have it analysed . The other earring was discovered to contain a cultured pearl, which means it had been produced by an oyster farmer in controlled conditions and is not as valuable. It is thought to be worth around £5,000 ($8,000; €6,000) but will not be part of the sale. Jonathan Edwards, head of the jewellery department at Woolley and Wallis, said: 'The pearl came in from a private source and was presented as part of a pair of drop earrings. 'The owner's wife had probably worn them. 'I looked at them and it seemed as though one of them might be a natural pearl, which are worth considerably more than cultured pearls. 'I thought there was a difference between the two because one had an outer layer of about one milimetre thick, but the other seemed to be solid. 'It is very difficult to tell if a pearl is cultured or natural by looking at it and you can never be 100 per cent sure unless you have it X-rayed. They confirmed that the 33.14 carat natural gem is the largest round pearl ever to be offered at auction and would have taken around 10 years to develop in the oyster's shell . 'We had it X-rayed at a London lab and they said it was natural, and we then sent it to a lab in Switzerland who said the same thing. 'The oyster that produced this pearl is a gold lip oyster, which live for about 10 years. 'It is estimated to sell for 120,000 pounds but I think it might go for a quarter of a million pounds. The owner was very surprised and excited when I told him. 'They have shot up in value over the last few years and they are on the crest of a wave.' Bidders around the world will be flocking to the auction on 1st May at Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury to try and get their hands on this incredibly rare item. Pearls are formed when an oyster produces layers of something called nacre as a protective mechanism. Nacre . is crystallised calcium carbonate that ‘blisters’ around a foreign . contaminant inside the shell of an oyster to protect its body. Nacre surrounds and hardens around an object, creating a pearl. But the process can take years – the longer it is allowed to continue, the bigger the pearl as more layers of nacre are added. The oyster will do this when there is an irritant inside their shell. An irritant can be anything from another organism to a piece of tissue. Cultured pearls are made by humans artificially placing an irritant inside the shell but, although the pearl will look similar, its interior will not have layers. Natural pearls, on the other hand, are produced without any human interference and are very rare.","A pair of earrings have been found to contain a rare natural pearl .

"By . Rob Wildman . Whitgift proved hospitable and formidable opponents in toppling Sedbergh in the first big weekend of Daily Mail Schools Trophy action this season. This eagerly-awaited south-north battle produced a memorable contest with victory going to Croydon-based Whitgift, 24-22, following a late penalty from centre Alex Hogg. The Cumbrian visitors were treated to a chicken dinner on arrival in south London, but Whitgift’s hospitality stopped on pitch the next day where a last-gasp effort brought a first win over Sedbergh. Whitgift fly-half evades the tackle of Sedbergh's outside centre at Haling Park in South Croydon . Whitgift got off to a winning start against Sedbergh in the opening round of the Daily Mail Schools Trophy . Sedbergh, who were runners up to Woodhouse Grove last season, had looked set to maintain dominance over Whitgift when establishing a 22-13 lead following tries by captain Freddie Renwick, full-back Jonny McPhillips and lock Max Davies. But Whitgift struck back through tries by wings George Pearson and Ben Donohue backed up by the goal-kicking of Hogg who contributed 14 points. ‘We never gave up and our ‘scramble’ defence was very good,’ admitted Chris Wilkins, Whitgift’s director of rugby. ‘Sedbergh always treat us very well when we go up to their place so we reciprocated with dinner for the two teams and staff the night before. ‘The two schools have the same ethos about the game and always get on well,’ Wilkins added. Sedbergh’s Simon Mulholland felt his team had missed too many chances, especially in the first half. ‘We could have won but they finished the stronger.’ Victory for Whitgift gives them the launch pad to challenge for honours in the second season of the Trophy which is organised on a merit table basis by schoolsrugby.co.uk for the leading rugby-playing schools over the autumn term. Croydon-based Whitgift won 24-22 following a late penalty from centre Alex Hogg . Sedbergh were runners up to Woodhouse Grove in last season's Daily Mail Schools Trophy . Whitgift are now building up to face another fancied team in Wellington later this month. Last season’s fourth-placed team avenged defeat by RGS High Wycombe last September thanks to a late try from England under-16 centre Matt Williams. His fine effort earned a 22-19 win, wing Tom Parton contributing two tries. Champions Woodhouse Grove may be rebuilding after the success of last season, but they continued their winning ways by beating Ashville College, 40-3. They expect a tougher test at Yorkshire rivals, St Peter’s, on Saturday. Newcastle RGS and Durham stage the first competitive match on the new artificial pitch at Kingston Park on Friday, kick off 7pm. These north-east rivals have had contrasting starts to the season.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cancer scientists are turning to astronomy to identify the faint hallmarks of aggressive tumours. Techniques developed to find distant galaxies have been adapted to look for indistinct biomarkers. The research could lead to computers replacing the age-old practice of peering down a microscope to search for signs of deadly cancer. Aggressive tumours are traditionally spotted by staining cells to show up specific proteins. The distance and distribution of galaxies can be measured using what cosmologists call a standard ruler . The new approach employs an automated system originally developed to pick out far away objects in the night sky. In tests, the technique was employed to measure levels of three proteins among tumour samples from more than 2,000 breast cancer patients. Researchers compared the accuracy of assessing the results manually or by computer. They found that the automated system was at least as accurate as the manual one but many times faster. Useful: The technique was employed to measure levels of three proteins among tumour samples from more than 2,000 breast cancer patients . Lead scientist Dr Raza Ali, from Cancer Research UK's Cambridge Institute, said: 'We've exploited the natural overlap between the techniques astronomers use to analyse deep sky images from the largest telescopes and the need to pinpoint subtle differences in the staining of tumour samples down the microscope. 'The results have been even better than we'd hoped, with our new automated approach performing with accuracy comparable to the time-consuming task of scoring images manually, after only relatively minor adjustments to the formula. 'We're now planning a larger international study involving samples from more than 20,000 breast cancer patients to further refine our strategy.' The research, conducted with the help of Cambridge University astronomers, is reported in the British Journal of Cancer. Co-author Professor Carlos Caldas, also from the Cambridge Institute, said: 'Modern techniques are giving us some of the first insights into the key genes and proteins important in predicting the success or failure of different cancer treatments. 'But before these can be applied in the clinic, their usefulness needs to be verified in hundreds or sometimes thousands of tumour samples. 'Already this new automated approach means we can now analyse up to 4,000 images a day, helping streamline the process of translating these discoveries into the clinic.' Dr Nicholas Walton, from Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, said: 'It's great that our image analysis software, which was originally developed to help track down planets harbouring life outside of our Solar System, is now also being used to help improve the outlook for cancer patients, much closer to home.'","Tumours traditionally spotted by staining cells to show up specific proteins .

Hughes has joined a long list of Premier League managers who have had to change their selection plans for this weekend's fixtures as their players have returned from the international break with injury knocks. Diouf, who netted Stoke's winner against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium before joining up with Senegal, had to complete the majority of a 12,000-mile round trip in economy class before eventually touching back down in Manchester on Friday afternoon. Mame Biram Diouf may have to sit out Stoke City's home match against Leicester City on Saturday . Mark Hughes is upset at Mame Biram Diouf's late arrival back in England following his return from Africa . Hughes has stated he might have to have more of a say on how Diouf, who scored in Senegal's 2-0 win against Egypt on Friday, travels to and from Africa. The Stoke boss said: 'He realised quite late on he was down as an economy ticket and tried to change it. 'In the end, I don't think he was able to get on business class, going out, and I don't think there were any tickets left. Mame Biram Diouf, pictured playing for his country in 2010, had to travel to Africa in economy class . 'It's something we maybe need to look at to make sure we have an input because it compromises the players if they don't travel right coming home and I think the complete journey was 12,000 miles. 'He flew in from Paris to Manchester - so I assume there was a flight from Johannesburg and one from Botswana. 'You don't get any information, which is disappointing - that should be a prerisquite.'

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is hoping one of the men he inherited can be his most important 'new signing'. Italy international Emanuele Giaccherini was already at the Stadium of Light in October last year when Poyet was parachuted in and charged with the task of dragging the Black Cats out of desperate relegation trouble. However, the £6.5million signing from Juventus struggled to command a place in the Uruguayan's team as he gradually plotted a route to Barclays Premier League safety. Sunderland midfielder Emanuele Giaccherini (right) is pictured in action against Queens Park Rangers . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet, pictured in training, believes Emanuele Giaccherini will improve this season . But far from sulk and look for a way out of Wearside, Giaccherini has returned and redoubled his efforts to catch the head coach's eye, and has done just that. Poyet said: 'I see him as a new player, a totally new player. It was difficult for him to play with us last year for different reasons, not only because of him, me picking the team in a certain way, not finding that position for him in the team regularly. 'He did well for a period in November, December when he was playing wide, but he didn't score and we needed something else, and it didn't work. 'Then he came back in pre-season in an incredible way - he was outstanding, one of the top three players in everything. He was playing well, he was pushing for a start, and he got injured. 'Then he came back sooner than expected. He has played two 90 minutes with Italy, which is very difficult - only 11 players can start for Italy, a great national team, and he is one of them, which is fantastic. 'The idea is to use him and to make sure that if he picks himself, that will be to the benefit of the team. I am very happy with Giaccherini, he looks like a totally new player.' Sunderland remain a work in progress after yet another significant rebuilding programme with nine new faces having arrived during the summer transfer window and by Poyet's own admission, gaps still to plug. Italy international Emanuele Giaccherini (right) plays head tennis with team-mate Wes Brown (left) Former Brighton manager Gus Poyet (right) gets fully involved in a training session with his players . In the circumstances, he is still working to forge a coherent method with his new-look team, although he insists there is nothing complicated about the bottom line. He said: 'It's quite simple: the goalkeeper needs to make saves and if he saves every ball, we don't concede; and the striker, if he puts the ball in the net, we are going to win plenty of games. 'Those two roles are clear. They are unfair, sometimes - the goalkeeper saves every single ball, but makes one mistake and it's a bad one, and the striker, the opposite - but it's simple. 'The rest, they have got different responsibilities. It's a great challenge for the offensive players at this club to become the top scorer, the one who is going to score double figures and is going to be the important one week in, week out.' Poyet's work to date will be put to the test on Saturday when former club Tottenham arrive at the Stadium of Light for a game the South American knows will test his players to the full.

'They have got quality, they are a very interesting team. With a new manager, they are going to make it difficult and we need to be spot-on, we need to be good.

An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets. Nasa’s meteoroid visualisations are produced using the space agency’s Asgard software program which tracks an estimated 4,000-5,000 meteoroids a day. The blue map follows their position in the sky using the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR). The main showers are highlighted with circles and listed by their International Astronomical Union name. A second radar map looks at meteoroid speed. The red regions indicate a speed of 7.5 miles/s (12km/s), the green from 26 miles/s (42km/s) and the blue from 41 miles/s (66km/s). The top left hand corner of the map shows the date and time of the data, which Nasa claims to be near real-time. The data is constructed using a network of 12 cameras, six of which are placed in north Alabama, north Georgia, southern Tennessee, and southern North Carolina. A further four are in the northern Ohio/Pennsylvania area, and the remaining two are located in southern New Mexico. The cameras have overlapping fields of view, which means that the same fireball can be detected by more than one camera. This allows Nasa to calculate the height of the fireball and how fast it is going.  They can also work out the orbit of the meteoroid responsible for creating the fireball, which gives clues about whether it came from a comet or an asteroid. If a camera captures an image of a fireball, it is uploaded to the Asgard site, with images dating back to three weeks. The data is constructed using a network of 12 cameras, six of which are placed in north Alabama, north Georgia, southern Tennessee, and southern North Carolina. Pictured here are two images taken from the camera network in the past three weeks. The bottom left on both images shows a streak of light which could be a meteor as it burns up in Earth atmosphere .

This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere . If the fireball is travelling slow enough, and makes it low enough,  it is possible that it can survive to the ground as a meteorite. Earlier this month, an incredible animation for MailOnline was unveiled that lets you scroll and zoom around the world as meteorite impacts from recorded history unfold before your eyes. The map was created by data journalist Simon Rogers, and shows where asteroids have impacted over the last thousand years. Scrolling around the world, you can see where some of the biggest hotspots are. And it also highlights how vulnerable our planet is to asteroids. Nasa estimates that just 1 per cent of the millions of asteroids in our solar system have been found. But, although you can see recorded impacts on land in these animations, most asteroids that encounter Earth either explode in the atmosphere or land at sea. This means the vast majority are unrecorded and, as we don't know the location of every asteroid in the solar system, we're not sure when one will next hit.","Maps produced using the space agency’s Asgard program which tracks an estimated 4,000-5,000 meteoroids a day .

The challenge of focusing on the job in hand will have never been greater for Scott Quigg, who defends his WBA super-bantamweight world title in Manchester on Saturday knowing that one of the biggest domestic fights in recent years is just around the corner. A slip against Stephane Jamoye would carry unimaginable consequences for the 25-year-old, such is the prospect of a unification bout against Northern Ireland’s Carl Frampton, the protege of Barry McGuigan and holder of the IBF belt. Talks between the pair’s representatives have stalled in the past.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is the app that can learn your thoughts, habits, likes and dislikes. It can predict who you want to talk to, where you want to go, and even help you type faster than ever before. Swiftkey, a replacement keyboard for mobile phones, today went free in bid to replace the built in keyboards on mobile phones and tablets. Scroll down for video . The SwiftKey Keyboard replaces a mobile device¿s keyboard with one that understands language and learns your personal writing style over time. SwiftKey works by understanding how words work together in context and continually learning to improve its knowledge. This means it can predict your next word when typing, but also radically improves the accuracy of autocorrection. The app also lets you type by sliding your fingers across the screen, which can speed things up. It can also store your preferences online so they can be used on all your gadgets, and is constantly updated with trending phrases as new words becmome popular. The SwiftKey Keyboard replaces a mobile device’s keyboard with one that understands language and learns your personal writing style. 'With the latest version of SwiftKey Keyboard, we’re providing an even more intuitive and personalized experience for our users, which they’re increasingly expecting,' said co-founder and CTO Ben Medlock. 'We’ve expanded our design team to focus on developing creative and beautiful user experiences.' The app launched in 2010, and is one of the world’s best-selling Android applications, spending more days at number one on Google Play than any other paid app. Earlier this month the firm revealed it is planning a version for Apple's iOS after the firm decided to allow alternative keyboards for the first time. Joe Braidwood, SwiftKey’s Chief Marketing Officer, told MailOnline the firm is confident it will have the app ready to go for the official release of the iOS 8 software, expected to be in September. The firm was set up by two Cambridge graduates, Jon Reynolds  and Dr Ben Medlock, 33 and it boasts it has saved users over 50 billion keystrokes, with over 6 million downloads. 'I went into the civil service and saw someone in a meeting typing on a Blackberry in a really cack-handed way, and I started to talk to Ben about how to improve this,' said Reynolds. SwiftKey in action: The free app can predict the next word, and let users type by swiping across the keyboard. 'It was his background in computational linguistics that made it work - we wanted to improve the correction.' In addition to new themes, the update brings several other user-requested improvements. Support for over 800 emoji is now integrated directly into the keyboard, with a new prediction feature that learns how emoji are used and predicts them as you type. The firm now says it will make money by selling add on 'theme' keyboards. Jon Reynolds said: 'This is the start of an incredibly exciting phase for us as a business. 'We have made the decision to go free to better enable everyone, everywhere, to use SwiftKey’s market-leading technology without payment being a barrier. 'We’re focused not only on reaching more users with our powerful technology, but on building great content and features to engage them.'","British inventors created system to predict what users will type next .

"By . Mark Prigg . Lego has unveiled a radical augmented reality app that brings real-life toys built out of the iconic bricks to life when viewed through a tablet or phone. Each $35 Lego Fusion box, which go on sale in August, will contain some 200 bricks and a special baseplate to build on. When children point their tablet camera at the finished toy, it springs to life and lets them play games. Lego Fusion line combines traditional LEGO bricks with app gaesm. Creations on a special base plate can be photographed with Apple or Android phones or tablets and imported into free, downloadable games. Each Lego fusion box consists of a distinct set of bricks, a free downloadable app and the new Fusion capture plate, a small brick building plate with a printed design that enables a smart phone or tablet's camera to identify the size and colors of the LEGO bricks built onto it. In response to game prompts, children build vertically in 2-D on the capture plate, enabling the app to 'see,' import and transform the creation into 3-D in the digital world. Creations on the plate can be photographed with Apple or Android phones or tablets and imported into free, downloadable games. There are several Lego-themed games already, but this is the first time it's blending real and virtual this way. Many toy companies are going down that route, trying to capture some of the attention - and money - that's being diverted from physical products to iPhone and Android games. In 'Lego Fusion Town Master,' kids build house facades on the plates and import them into a game that simulates a small town, inhabited by Lego figures. In 'Battle Towers,' they build sections of a medieval-style tower and defend it against flying monsters. In 'Create & Race,' they build cars and race them on a virtual track. Different designs yield cars that differ in speed, durability and handling. In September, Lego is following up with 'Resort Designer,' in the style of its girl-oriented 'Friends' line. The games are designed to force the kids to return to the physical blocks and rebuild their structures, said Ditte Bruun Pedersen, senior design manager at Lego's Future Lab. The kits its will cost $30 each, and contain around 200 bricks along with the special base . But the lab's research also shows that kids want to bring their physical creations to life, she said. 'Kids want to be this mini-figure and they want to be in this world they create,' Pedersen said. 'Children have always imagined their LEGO creations as immersive worlds which come to life for hours of role-play and adventure,' said Pedersen. The special base allows the app to work out where each brick is, and trigger the virtual game on screen . 'Recently, smart phones and tablets have become a popular platform for empowering game mechanisms that kids love. Fusion brings these two favorite play patterns together in an experience where real-life builds come to life in a virtual game, inspiring creativity, strategy, and the pride of creation.' The Fusion boxes are launching in the U.S. only and will be exclusive to Toys R Us and Lego's own stores, Lego said. The firm also designed the game to make players switch between on screen action and the virtual game. 'In our research, we heard repeatedly from parents that they are constantly battling 'zombie gaze,' the experience when their children are immersed in their device screens for large blocks of time, said Pedersen. 'We developed Lego Fusion with this challenge in mind, creating a play experience that keeps children entertained with the kind of app gameplay they love while giving real reasons to return to the brick pile to creatively build.'","$35 Lego Fusion box contains 200 bricks and special baseplate to build on .

The conversation, which concerned scouting reports of free agents and has just become public, included Ferry saying that Deng 'has a little African in him. Not in a bad way, but he's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back.' Ferry also described Deng as being 'two-faced' and accused him of being a liar and a cheat. Fighting back: Luol Deng has described his pride at his African heritage after comments by Danny Ferry . Punished: Atlanta Hawks general manager Ferry was disciplined by the team for racist remarks about Deng . Power: Michael Gearon Jr (left) and Bruce Levenson . Deng has now responded to those claims in a strongly-worded statement, describing the pride he feels towards his African heritage. 'HE HAS A LITTLE AFRICAN IN HIM,' Deng begins. 'These words were recently used to describe me. It would ordinarily make any African parent proud to hear their child recognised for their heritage. 'I'm proud to say I actually have a lot of African in me, not just 'a little.' For my entire life, my identity has been a source of pride and strength. Among my family and friends, in my country of South Sudan and across the broader continent of Africa, I can think of no greater privilege than to do what I love for a living while also representing my heritage on the highest stage. Unfortunately, the comment about my heritage was not made with the same respect and appreciation. 'Concerning my free agency, the focus should purely have been on my professionalism and my ability as an athlete. Every person should have the right to be treated with respect and evaluated as an individual, rather than be reduced to a stereotype. I am saddened and disappointed that this way of thinking still exists today. I am even more disturbed that it was shared so freely in a business setting. 'However, there is comfort in knowing that there are people who aren't comfortable with it and have the courage to speak up. In the same way a generalization should not define a group of people, the attitude of a few should not define a whole organization or league. 'Ultimately, I'm thankful to be with an organisation that appreciates me for who I am and has gone out of its way to make me feel welcome.' Ever present: Deng spent a decade at the Chicago Bulls before moving to Cleveland and now Miami Heat . Ferry has been disciplined by Hawks CEO Steve Koonin but details of his punishment have not been revealed. He will remain the team's general manager. Ferry apologised for his comments on Tuesday but claimed he was only repeating what he had heard about Sudan-born Deng. 'In regards to the insensitive remarks that were used during our due diligence process, I was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players,' Ferry said in the statement. 'I repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process. Those words do not reflect my views, or words that I would use to describe an individual and I certainly regret it. I apologise to those I offended and to Luol, who I reached out to Monday morning.' An investigation into Ferry's comments also led to the discovery of a racist email sent by co-owner Bruce Levenson. He has since announced that he will sell his controlling stake in the team.","Miami Heat star Luol Deng has hit back at racist comments made by Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry .

"A massive underground ocean on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea, it has been revealed. Nasa scientists analyzing data from the Cassini mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts. They say the density of the oceans mean they are are salty as the Dead Sea. Researchers found that Titan's ice shell, which overlies a very salty ocean, varies in thickness around the moon, suggesting the crust is in the process of becoming rigid. Nasa scientists analyzing data from the Cassini mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts. Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data. This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. It is believed the ocean is made of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The new results come from a study of gravity and topography data collected during Cassini's repeated flybys of Titan during the past 10 years. Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. The findings are published in this week’s edition of the journal Icarus. 'Titan continues to prove itself as an endlessly fascinating world, and with our long-lived Cassini spacecraft, we’re unlocking new mysteries as fast as we solve old ones,' said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was not involved in the study. The salt content allows the bathers to read while floating effortlessly in the Dead Sea, Jordan Valley. Experts say the underground ocean on Titan would be similar. Additional findings support previous indications the moon's icy shell is rigid and in the process of freezing solid. Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data. This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. 'This is an extremely salty ocean by Earth standards,' said the paper's lead author, Giuseppe Mitri of the University of Nantes in France. 'Knowing this may change the way we view this ocean as a possible abode for present-day life, but conditions might have been very different there in the past.' Cassini data also indicate the thickness of Titan's ice crust varies slightly from place to place. The researchers said this can best be explained if the moon's outer shell is stiff, as would be the case if the ocean were slowly crystalizing, and turning to ice. This image provided by NASA is a recent photo from the Cassini spacecraft showing planet Saturn, and if you look very closely between its wing-like rings, upper left, reveals a faint pinprick of light. That tiny dot is Earth. Otherwise, the moon's shape would tend to even itself out over time, like warm candle wax. This freezing process would have important implications for the habitability of Titan's ocean, as it would limit the ability of materials to exchange between the surface and the ocean. A further consequence of a rigid ice shell, according to the study, is any outgassing of methane into Titan's atmosphere must happen at scattered 'hot spots' -- like the hot spot on Earth that gave rise to the Hawaiian Island chain.","Believed the ocean is made of sulfur, sodium and potassium .

"By . Paul Hirst . Darren Anderton believes Jack Wilshere is destined to become a world-class star rather than England's next 'sicknote'. With the retirement of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, Wilshere now has a chance to nail down a place in Roy Hodgson's starting XI - providing he stays fit. Wilshere was hailed as England's next big thing when he won his first cap aged 18, but injury has since limited his career - just as it did to Anderton, who picked up the unwanted nickname of 'sicknote' following a series of lay-offs.

The former Tottenham and England midfielder, speaking on behalf of official England team sponsor Vauxhall, is convinced Wilshere has the potential to become one of the best midfielders in the world. 'If someone like Jack Wilshere can steer clear of injury for six months, he will become a world-class player,' said Anderton, whose international career was restricted to just 30 appearances. 'I understand what Scholesy was saying. Yes, he hasn't gone forward from the player that burst on to the scene, but some of that is down to injury.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s a common problem: you want to go and visit another planet in the solar system but you’re just not sure of the best way to get there. This space subway map should come in handy, then, as it shows you how much energy you’ll need to go on an interplanetary tour. From Earth to Neptune, you’ll never get lost in space again as the map shows you the velocity you'll need to reach in order to escape from the gravitational pull of various planets and moons, or visit a new destination. Scroll down for a guide to how the map works . In the map, created by Ulysse Carion, each planet or moon of interest is denoted by a circle. The 'intercept' areas denote areas where it is possible to change trajectory towards another world. Each number on the graph, meanwhile, denotes how much 'delta-v', or velocity and fuel, is needed to get to different destinations . The map was created by California student Ulysse Carion. The numbers on the map denote the various amounts of ‘delta-v’ a space traveller would need to visit various different locations. Delta-v, which means ‘change in velocity’, is a measure of how much fuel is needed to reach a given destination; the higher the number, the more fuel is needed. For example, to get from Earth to low Earth orbit it’s seen that an astronaut needs a spaceship that can accelerate to 9,400 metres per second. Going further, of course, requires much more fuel. ‘I made the map for a rather mundane reason; I just got a copy of Adobe Illustrator for free from my university and I wanted to try Illustrator out,’ Carion says to MailOnline. ‘The map is actually misleading in some ways when it comes to the difficulty of space travel. ‘Some things are pretty accurate - for example, notice how it takes 27,000 m/s delta-v to go from the surface of Venus to low Venus orbit. ‘That's almost three times larger than the equivalent manoeuvre cost on Earth. This tremendous number is due to the incredible thickness of the Venusian atmosphere.’ This is compared, Carion explains, to escaping the surface of Mars’ tiny moon Deimos. Doing this requires about just six metres per second of delta-v, which could be achieved by riding a bike off a ramp. Each planet or moon of interest is denoted by a circle. The ‘intercept’ areas denote areas where it is possible to change trajectory towards another world. Each number on the graph denotes how much ‘delta-v’, or velocity and fuel, is needed to get to different destinations. The larger a planet or moon, the higher its gravity and the more delta-v is needed. For example leaving Jupiter, the biggest planet in the solar system, requires a whopping combined 62,200 metres (204,000 feet) per second of delta-v. Escaping the surface of Mars’ tiny moon Deimos, meanwhile, requires just six metres (20 feet) per second of delta-v. The white arrows on the map, meanwhile, show that ‘aerobraking’ is available. This is a method of reducing the speed of a spacecraft by using a planet’s atmosphere. Finally, as Carion explains, the map requires spacecraft to use a ‘Hohmann transfer orbit’ - where a spacecraft moves from the orbit of one body to another by ‘jumping’ into its orbit with a boost of speed. This makes use of something called the ‘Oberth effect’, which states that a rocket travelling at high speed generates more useful energy than one at low speed. Illustrated here is the 'Interplanetary Transport Network', a visualisation of how spacecraft can traverse the solar system using various gravity assists. Carion explains that his map doesn't involve the use of these gravity assists, which makes space travel around the solar system much easier . ‘However, some things are very misleading about this map,’ Carion continues. ‘It does not account for gravity assists, which is when you use other planets' gravity to catapult yourself to somewhere else. ‘The energy savings from gravity assists and low-energy transfers can be very significant, but you can only get gravity assists when the planets are in the right position.’ Gravity assists are indeed a very useful tool for spacecraft; they are almost always used to reach distant locations in the solar system. Perhaps the most famous examples of this are the Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977. Using gravity assists from planets along the way they were able to fly-by and study Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. In fact, Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft ever to visit Uranus and Neptune in the solar system. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were both launched in 1977 to make use of the favourable alignment of planets. This allowed them to visit all four of the outermost planets in the solar system without requiring huge amounts of fuel - instead they could use gravity assists from the planets. Illustrated here is the Voyager 2 spacecraft passing Saturn during its closest approach on 25 August 1981 . Carion goes on to explain how the map was created using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, a famous equation first devised by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903. He used it to explain the basic principles of how rockets work, with his equation being based on similar work by British mathematician William Moore eight years earlier in 1813. Over 50 years before mankind would actually contemplate the idea of going to space, Tsiolkovsky realised how rocket travel would work. He calculated that as more fuel were added to a rocket, to give it more power, this would in turn increase its mass; but as the mass increased, so too would more fuel be needed. This posed a difficult problem, namely that to travel large distances huge amounts of fuel would be needed. To overcome the rocket equation it was necessary for scientists to devise alternative means of travel, such as gravity assists and Hohmann tranfser orbits, in order to explore the solar system.","California student Ulysse Carion has created a map showing how spacecraft can explore the solar system .

A total of five sheep from Harewell Hall in Harrogate have been fitted with cameras (pictured), dubbed 'sheepcams'. Each camera will record the Tour De France as it passes through the Yorkshire town on Saturday . Research has found that a sheep’s experiences soon after birth can shape its later behaviour - and also that of its offspring. The study from the University of Bristol investigated whether early-life experiences can alter behavioural responses to a naturally painful event in adulthood - giving birth - and also affect behaviour of the next generation. Female sheep that had their tails docked showed more pain-related behaviour when giving birth to their first lambs than did females who had not had these early-life experiences. Lambs of those mothers who had experienced a mild infection in early life were less sensitive to pain during the first few days of their lives. Each of the animals from Harewell Hall have been fitted with wearable action cameras from Sony. They are waterproof, include image stabilisation and all five can be controlled at one time with a single remote. Ian Hammond said: ‘Locally we are really looking forward to the Tour de France coming through Yorkshire, the dales certainly are a good test for cyclists and I’m looking forward to seeing how my flock perform as Sony’s first ever sheep cam’. Earlier today, German entrant Marcel Kittel, 26, warned Yorkshire's roads could be too narrow for the Tour de France. He said the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for riders taking part in the opening stages. The wearable Full HD video cameras are splash-proof and feature image stabilisation. Live footage can be merged with GPS data to track the location of the sheep . The 'sheepcams' will be remotely controlled by farmer Ian Hammond (pictured left). The Live-View Remote, seen on Hammond's wrist, can control up to five cameras at one time. The cameras are securely fastened using a harness (pictured right) Kittel warned parts of the route from Leeds to Harrogate were 'very dangerous' for the peloton, who will be waved off by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry on Saturday. One particularly tricky area in Buttertubs Pass, a high road in the Yorkshire Dales that winds north from Sinstone, near Hawes, towards Thwaite and Muker. The opening stage of the Tour de France begins in Leeds on Saturday, before the second stage commences from York to Sheffield on Sunday. The event, won last year by Britain's Chris Froome, often includes technically challenging routes, including mountain climbs, narrow streets and cobbled surfaces. A spokesman for Yorkshire's Grand Départ defended the region's roads as testing, but suitable, for the world's best riders. The opening stage of the Tour de France starts in Leeds on the morning of 5 July and ends in Harrogate (pictured). The sheep will record the footage as the cyclists travel between Ripon and Ripley .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . How do the spindly legs of a giraffe support its huge weight? It's something that has puzzled scientists, but they may now have uncovered the answer. Researchers at the Royal Veterinary College in London have identified a highly specialised ligament structure that is thought to prevent giraffes' legs from collapsing under the immense weight of the animal. Researchers at the Royal Veterinary College in London have studied the legs of giraffes and found that they were able to withstand huge forces thanks to a distinct groove that runs along the length of their shins, housing a structure called the suspensory ligament.  This structure is found in other large animals, such as horses . ‘Giraffes are heavy animals, around 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds), but have unusually skinny limb bones for an animal of this size’ explained lead investigator Chris Basu, a PhD student in the Structure and Motion Lab. In other leg-related news, scientists looked at how kangaroos maintain their balance. When foraging for food, these usually majestic creatures look ungainly and awkward as they attempt to balance their heavy bodies. But now researchers have discovered that appearances may be deceiving, and their cumbersome movements are in fact helped by a fifth ‘limb’; their tails. Scientists from Colorado, Sydney and Burnaby in Canada discovered that a kangaroo’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. 'We found that when a kangaroo is walking, it uses its tail just like a leg,' said Associate Professor Maxwell Donelan of Simon Fraser University in in Burnaby, Canada. ‘This means their leg bones are under high levels of mechanical stress.’ In giraffes, the equivalents to our metatarsal bone (in the foot) and metacarpal bone (in the hand) are extremely elongated, accounting for roughly half the leg length. A distinct groove runs along the length of these bones, housing a structure called the suspensory ligament. This structure is found in other large animals, such as horses - which are well known for their ability to sleep whilst standing - but this is the first time that it has been studied in giraffes. The researchers hypothesised that this arrangement may help solve the mystery of how the giraffes' spindly legs can support its weight. To test this, the researchers received donations of limbs from European zoos; these came from giraffes which had died naturally in captivity or been euthanised for reasons unrelated to this work. The limbs were then fixed in a rigid frame and, using a hydraulic press, the researchers applied forces of up to 2,500 Newtons (around 250 kg), to simulate the bodyweight supported by each limb. It was found that the limbs remained upright and stable without any additional support and could even withstand greater loads. To test the strength of giraffe legs the researchers received donations of limbs from European zoos; these came from giraffes which had died naturally in captivity or been euthanised for reasons unrelated to this work. The limbs were then fixed in a rigid frame and subjected to large forces, equivalent to the weight of a giraffe . As the suspensory ligament is elastic tissue, and not muscle, it cannot generate force itself so can only offer passive support. This means that giraffes can support their weight without actively engaging as much muscle, thereby reducing fatigue. The suspensory ligament is also thought to prevent the foot joints from overextending and protect the feet from collapsing. Mr Basu hopes that this information will help to explain how giraffes evolved from small, antelope-like species to the iconic long-necked animals we know today. 'I'd like to link modern giraffes with fossil specimens to illustrate the process of evolution,' Mr Basu said. 'We hypothesise that the suspensory ligament has allowed giraffes to reach large sizes that they otherwise would not have been able to achieve'.","Researchers at the Royal Veterinary College in London studied giraffe legs .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A few decades ago astronomers were pretty confident they knew how planets formed. Based on our own solar system they thought small, rocky planets formed near their host star and larger, gaseous or icy planets formed further out. So when they started finding planets that didn’t conform to any of these theories they were confused: were their prevailing theories of planet formation wrong? Theories of planet formation are being tested as astronomers find bizarre new worlds in the universe. This artist's illustration shows the planet designated HD 209458b orbiting close to its host star, despite being the size of Jupiter. Known as a 'hot Jupiter', this is a type of planet that was once thought not possible to exist . In the last 20 years, reports Nature, we have found worlds we never thought possible. Most massive . 28.5 Jupiters: DENIS-P J082303.1-491201 b . Least massive . 0.02 Earths: PSR B1257+12A . Shortest orbit . 5.8 hours: Kepler-70b . System with most planets . Nine: HD 10180 . Planet with most stars . Four: PH1b . For example, some planets have been found so close to their star that they orbit in just days - but density studies indicate these planets are somehow made of ice. Other rocky planets have been found so big that they have led astronomers to question exactly how planets can form. The current model of planet formation is that they are born out of the dust and gas that also creates the star at the core of a planetary system, known as the core-accretion process. As the central star rotates it spins the surrounding material and heats it. Other time this material clumps together, with materials with high melting points like iron and rock forming nearer the sun. Further out in the system it is colder, allowing ice to form, while planets also accumulate some of the gas in their vicinity, becoming ‘gas giants’ like Jupiter and Saturn in our own. Why, then, have we found systems where there are gas giants in orbit a tenth the distance of Mercury in our own solar system (known as 'hot Jupiters')? Why do some planetary systems have giant ‘super-Earths’, huge rocky planets devoid of a gaseous exterior, orbiting in their extremes? And why, too, do some planets orbit in wildly elliptical orbits rather than in a flat ‘plane’ like those in our solar system? The answer: we just don’t know. Previously it was thought our solar system was the norm for how planets form. But the discovery of worlds unlike any of the eight planets around our sun suggests the preconceived notion that gas giants form far out and rocky planets inwards (illustrated) is not necessarily correct . This graph shows the different sizes of planets discovered by Kepler as of January last year. Although the number of planets we know of has increased since then, it shows how many different types of planets we found, many of which are not even planets that exist in our own solar system . It's possible that, in some systems, planets are knocked into wild orbits by others, or they are captured by a star as it passes. The process of planet formation itself might, too, be more chaotic than we once thought. ‘The first detections of exoplanets revealed bodies which are utterly unlike any solar system planet,’ says Nasa, ‘and subsequent discoveries have shown that many exoplanet systems are very dissimilar from ours. ‘In some exosystems, planets as massive as Jupiter orbit so close to their star that they are heated to high temperature and their upper atmospheres are swept into space. ‘In other systems, planets follow elongated orbits (in contrast to the nearly circular orbits of the solar system).’ However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Finding planets that don’t conform to our theories merely means that we haven’t quite nailed down how planet formation works yet. It may even be that our solar system is fairly unique when compared to other planetary systems. After all, for one thing our system contains no ‘super-Earths’, whereas they seem to be common elsewhere in the galaxy. Another mystery is the abundance of super-Earths (illustration of Kepler-62f shown) elsewhere in the universe. Why do other planetary systems host at least one of these giant rocky planets, whereas our own solar system has none? Astronomers will be hoping to answer this question in future with new theories . ‘Out studies of exoplanets are just beginning, and it is not possible to be sure what will prove to be “typical” planets among our neighbouring stars,’ says Nasa. ‘Will most planet systems prove to be much like our own, or are we exceptional in more ways than we can imagine? Only years of further study will tell.’ That is not to say there are not exoplanet systems like our own, though; the star 55 Cancri, 41 light years away, has a system of five planets with a similar distribution to our own. But it may be that our theories for how these planets formed in the first place, and what sort of systems they inhabit, may need to be revised. ‘Perhaps the most interesting question, and one of the most difficult to answer, concerns the uniqueness of the Earth,’ concludes Nasa. ‘Are there planets similar to the Earth around other stars and does life exist on any other planet beyond our own Earth?’","Astronomers are being forced to rewrite their theories of planet formation .

But the discovery of bizarre planets in odd orbits has challenged theories .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . During the group stages of this year’s World Cup, a record 136 goals were scored – leading to more than one billion Facebook posts and comments. Data scientists from the social network analysed these posts to study the use of the word ‘goal’, and to see how people were stretching out the term, such as ‘gooooal’. They discovered that users in Venezuela were the most vocal, with an average 21 characters per goal post, but among teams in the competition, Mexico fans have added the most letters with 12.8. Facebook studied the use of the word 'goal' on the site.

Unsurprisingly, the fans of teams that scored more goals were more vocal, and it may be that Iranian fans had little to shout about. The longest exuberant mention of the word ‘goal,’ in any language, came from Argentina in celebration of Lionel Messi’s free-kick goal against Nigeria on June 25. That particular mention of ‘gol’ contained 20,400 letter ‘o’s. Facebook’s data team explained that if someone was to hold down the ‘o’ key on a keyboard for that amount of characters, it would take roughly 12 minutes to type. Due to the language differences, the researchers compared the relative number of extra characters within each version of the word goal, including ‘gol’ and ‘tor’. They found that only in Spanish, Portuguese, English, and German do people significantly use redundant characters in exuberant posts. Darker regions on this map represent the countries which have used the most characters in posts containing the word 'goal'.

Michel Platini said it is up to Didier Deschamps whether or not Franck Ribery plays for France . But Ribery told German newspaper Die Welt: 'I took this decision in consultation with Didier Deschamps. 'I want to concentrate on my club and I will not change my opinion.' Platini had warned that Ribery would be in breach of FIFA regulations should he reject a call-up, perhaps recalling the situation in 2006 when Claude Makelele was summoned by then-France coach Raymond Domenech, despite having announced his international retirement.

"By . Iain Rogers, Reuters . Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed Cristiano Ronaldo is in line to make his comeback from injury against Atletico Madrid on Saturday and has rubbished claims suggesting Diego Simeone's team are violent. Ronaldo was struggling with a knee injury at the end of last season and picked up a hamstring strain last month but has been passed fit by Real Madrid's medical team. 'He is on top form,' said Ancelotti. 'He has been training very well these past three weeks and he does not have any problems. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo is ready to return to action after overcoming a hamstring injury . Cristiano Ronaldo, Fabio Coentrao and their Real Madrid team-mates are put through their paces . Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has rubbished claims suggesting Atletico Madrid are a violent side . Diego Simeone's side will be hoping they can get one over arch rivals Real Madrid . The Portuguese international is likely to start in attack alongside Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale . Former Tottenham duo Luka Modric and Gareth Bale are both expected to start against Atletico Madrid . 'He is in optimal condition. He doesn't have a chronic injury. Last season he had one injury and now another. It's nothing chronic.' Saturday's game is a rematch of the season-opening Spanish Super Cup and a chance for Real to avenge their 2-1 aggregate defeat to their city rivals, the current La Liga champions. When asked by Spanish newspaper AS if Atletico Madrid were too aggressive, Ancelotti replied: 'No, they’re not a violent side; they are intense and aggressive but not violent. Football is a man’s game, it’s not a game for wimps.' Carlo Ancelotti must decide where he wants to deploy Gareth Bale and summer signing James Rodriguez . Javier Hernandez, pictured, is likely to make his Real Madrid debut from the substitutes' bench . The Mexican joined Real Madrid from Manchester United on a season-long loan deal on deadline day . Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Luka Modric will have to be at their best if Real are going to win the match . Iker Casillas and Keylor Navas are battling it out to start Saturday's match at the Santiago Bernabeu . It is also a chance for Real's new signing Javier Hernandez to make his debut since joining on loan from Manchester United and Ancelotti said the Mexico forward may come off the bench at some point. He is competing with France forward Karim Benzema for a place in the starting line-up. 'We are very happy with Chicharito. He won't play from the beginning on Saturday but he will be of use during the game.' Another of Real's new signings, James Rodriguez, has so far failed to reproduce the scintillating form that won him the golden boot award at the 2014 World Cup with six goals. Ancelotti said it was normal for a player to need time to settle in at a new club and Rodriguez, who joined the European champions from Monaco, was no different. 'It's clear that a new player needs time to adapt,' Ancelotti said. 'I am pleased with what he has done so far. It's normal that he might have the odd problem at the start.' Real's arch rivals Barcelona are the only team to have won both their opening games and host Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.","Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed Cristiano Ronaldo has recovered from a hamstring injury .

"By . Oliver Todd for MailOnline . Follow @@oliver_todd . CLICK HERE to register - for FREE - and start picking your £100million squad now... As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. MUHAMED BESIC IN A NUTSHELL . Besic showed enough of his potential in his limited pre-season appearances to leave Everton fans drooling - and if he can match anything like the expectations he is building up, he is sure to be a Premier League star. The midfield maestro was a £4million signing from Hungarian club Ferencvaros last month and adds another string to Roberto Martinez's bow in the Everton midfield with his ability to spray passes around and to supply the ammunition for the likes of Romelu Lukaku. The Bosnian is just 21 years old but is already setting a big reputation - and it won't be long until he is unleashed on the Premier League after securing a spot on the bench away at Leicester City. He is fast becoming a fans' favourite at Goodison Park due to his tough combative style - although that could have Fantasy managers worrying a little about the red and yellow cards he could pick up. Ready? Muhamed Besic will be hoping you back him in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game this season . Getting used to it: Besic is one of the most exciting young stars heading to the Premier League this season . Born: Berlin, Germany, September 10 1992 (age 21) Position: Central midfielder . Previous clubs: Hamburg, Ferencvaros . 2010-2012: Hamburg (3 appearances, 0 goals) 2012-2014: Ferencvaros (47 apps, 1 goal) World Cup 2014 . Appearances: 3 . Pass Completion: 91% . Successful Tackling: 90.91% . Interceptions: 2.33 per game . Stats from Opta . WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE BESIC IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Martinez likes to get his teams playing with the ball on the floor - and that should give Besic the perfect opportunity to prosper and rake in the Fantasy Football points. Besic is an exciting player but with the physical knowhow to prosper in the Premier League. Priced at just £5.9million in the game he represents a bargain when you consider that's below the price level of the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Joe Allen and Emanuele Giaccherini. WORLD CUP STAR . Besic found himself in the heart of midfield for Bosnia and Herzegovina as they just lost out at the group stage of the World Cup - impressing in particular against eventual runners-up Argentina. For his country he often found himself sitting very deep in midfield and robbed of the opportunity to showcase his passing in quite a defensive side - but that shouldn't be such a problem at Goodison. BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? Besic might have the tendency to sit a bit deeper in midfield than most but fear not... With Martinez not known for a lot of rotation he should get plenty of appearance points once he establishes himself in the side, a few key contributions to goals and likely win bonuses at Everton should sort him right out. Skills: Besic has the control and quick-thinking to add a touch of class to Everton' midfield . Can't stop him: Besic is willing to fight for every ball in the middle of the park - let's hope he gets no bookings! DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Besic has already left a great impression on Martinez, with the Everton boss saying the Bosnian is feeling right at home at his new club - which obviously bodes well for bedding in easily to the Premier League. 'To play in our midfield it’s not enough just to be tactically aware how to contain the opposition,' Martinez said. 'Mo has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he’s a technical player on the ball. I think that’s why the fans took to him so quickly, because he’s very complete. 'The biggest aspect that surprised me was Mo’s ability to get on the ball, control things and spray it about. When he’s adjusted we’ll see his best football shine. The mentality he showed at the World Cup was incredible for his age. 'Mo is at the perfect place to show what he can do now. He’s an exciting prospect.' Passing range: Besic sprays a trademark long pass - something Romelu Lukaku could prosper from .","Everton signed Muhamed Besic from Ferencvaros for £4million in July .

"By . Pa Reporter . Watford produced a stirring second-half display to score twice after being reduced to ten men with 25 minutes to play to beat Huddersfield 4-2 on a dramatic afternoon at Vicarage Road. Gabriel Tamas was sent off for the home side 65 minutes in but after that Keith Andrews and Almen Abdi (his second) put Huddersfield to bed. Prior to that, Troy Deeney and Abdi had seen goals cancelled out by Harry Bunn and Murray Wallace. Scroll down to click on full match reports for Fulham, Leeds and Nottingham Forest . Comeback: Almen Abdi (L) scores Watford's fourth goal against Huddersfield despite being reduced to 10-men . Norwich City's sequence of four consecutive victories came to an end as an impressive Bournemouth side left Carrow Road with a well deserved point from a 1-1 draw. The Canaries went into the game on a crest of a wave after a fine run that included a derby win at Ipswich and they looked good for another three points when Lewis Grabban scored against his former club after just 14 minutes. But Eddie Howe's side retained their composure and levelled just before half-time through Callum Wilson, the man who replaced Grabban at Dean Court. Wolves impressive attacking duo of Nouha Dicko and Bakary Sako combined to ensure that the team celebrated 125 years of league football at Molineux in style with a 3-1 Skybet Championship win over Blackburn Rovers. Dicko opened the scoring before Sako helped himself to a double as Kenny Jackett's side collected their fourth win from five games in the match the club had earmarked to commemorate the landmark. The duo put Wolves two goals ahead before Jordan Rhodes gave Blackburn a lifeline from the penalty spot, but his side could not build on that with Sako sealing his brace to sentence Blackburn to a second defeat in three games. All good things: Norwich 100% start to the Championship was ended by a 1-1 draw against Bournemouth . Defender Lewis Dunk scored deep into added time to rescue a point for Brighton in a 2-2 draw against unbeaten Charlton at the Amex Stadium. Striker Igor Vetokele twice put the Addicks ahead to take his tally to five goals, but Dunk produced two headers of his own to give Sami Hyypia's men a share of the points. The Seagulls went behind for the second successive game when Angolan striker Vetokele struck after only four minutes. Derby endured a frustrating afternoon when they were held at home for the first time this season as Ipswich fought back to draw 1-1 at the iPro Stadium. Chris Martin pounced from close range to give Derby an early lead but, after Jeff Hendrick was taken off with what looked a serious arm injury, Christophe Berra headed in from a free-kick in the 52nd minute. David McGoldrick was in the Ipswich team that drew 4-4 at Derby last season, but his absence from the squad only added to growing speculation that he will join Leicester on Monday. Equal terms: Chris Martin celebrates after drawing Derby County level with Ipswich Town . Scott McDonald scored one and set up another as Millwall made it three wins from their opening five Sky Bet Championship games by beating crisis club Blackpool 2-1 at the Den. The Australia international converted Jack Powell's free-kick after 33 minutes before setting up Scott Malone to make it two just after the break. Substitute Nile Ranger got Blackpool back into the game but they were unable to grab an equaliser. Simon Cox grabbed the only goal as Reading edged to a smash-and-grab Sky Bet Championship win at Middlesbrough. The Royals, who narrowly missed out on the play-offs last season, had picked up just five points from their opening five games. Yet the long trip back home will feel a great deal better after Cox's neat finish earned an undeserved three points on Teesside. At the double: Wigan forward Callum McManaman netted a brace for Wigan against Birmingham . Wigan wiped the floor with beleaguered Birmingham in a horribly one-sided Sky Bet Championship encounter at the DW Stadium. Callum McManaman was again the pick of the Latics players with two first-half goals as the home side led 3-0 at the break. Andrew Taylor and substitute Martyn Waghorn grabbed the others for Wigan, who could have won even more comprehensively than 4-0 such was their total superiority. Rotherham hit the crossbar twice but lost out 2-0 to a workmanlike Brentford who struck in added time in both halves. Andre Gray put the Londoners in front just before the interval after being set up by Alan Judge, and the game was made safe in the final seconds when substitute Nick Proschwitz scored from close range.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for MailOnline . Follow @@riathalsam . Tottenham insist they are not in discussions to sell the club for £1billion. It was reported that billionaire owner Joe Lewis was prepared to entertain offers for the club in which his company, Enic International, bought a controlling stake in 2001. But a Tottenham statement read: ‘Contrary to recent press speculation, neither the club, nor its majority shareholder, are in any takeover discussions and the focus of the club is fully on delivering the new stadium project.’ In the original plans, the Northumberland Development Project was due to be completed by August 2014 . The reports come at a time when Tottenham are searching for a temporary home, having accepted that it is 'highly unlikely’ they will be able to move into their proposed new stadium in time for the 2017-18 season. Wembley has apparently been ruled out because the stadium is limited by Brent Council to 37 events each year, owing to issues including noise, policing and parking. Arsene Wenger admitted it would make 'geographical sense' for Spurs and Arsenal to share the Emirates Stadium, though admitted it was unlikely. MK Dons' stadium:mk looks the favourite to become Tottenham's temporary home . MK Dons’ stadium:mk is understood to be a leading option and Mauricio Pochettino praised the 30,000-capacity ground on Thursday, having attended Dons’ shock Capital One Cup win over Manchester United last month. He said: ‘Every single decision that the club makes is to improve the club and give better solutions or facilities to our supporters. So I always back these decisions.’ When asked specifically about stadium:mk, he added: ‘Yes, I was in Milton Keynes to watch the game against Manchester United. It was my first time in Milton Keynes. It's a very good stadium with very good facilities.’ Mauricio Pochettino could face a season where Tottenham have to play home games at a neutral ground . Tottenham face Sunderland this weekend, having been trounced 3-0 by Liverpool before the international break. Highlighting the need for time to establish his ideas within the squad, Pochettino, who will name his new long-term team captain on Monday, said: ‘We need to learn and improve. We need to build a strong, confident and solid team. ‘The result was 3-0 to Liverpool but when you analyse the game, I think we got a lot of situation to analyse and improve. This is a good game for us to learn how to compete with the big teams. ‘The fans see that we need to improve. In football you always need time and patience and you need results. We are going the right way.’ Tottenham will move from White Hart Lane in an effort to compete financially with the big European clubs . Daniel Levy could consider moves to Wembley, Portman Road, Falmer Stadium or Stadium MK . He added: ‘My ambition is always to reach the top. We need to believe. This is the process and we need to provide our players, supporters and environment with belief. This is our objective. ‘I am very happy with the squad. When I arrived here I knew that in the last season Tottenham spent a lot of money and made a big investment.

"By . Adam Shergold . Aidy Boothroyd enjoyed the perfect start to his tenure as England Under 20 manager as Romania were hit for six in Telford on Friday night. With Roy Hodgson watching on from the stands, goals from Rolando Aarons, Josh Murphy, Lewis Baker, Kwame Thomas and two from Callum Robinson - all in the second-half - ensured a great start to the season. It had taken England some time to get into their groove but once Newcastle star Aarons opened the scoring on 54 minutes, goals followed at regular intervals. Hit for six: England Under 20s celebrate hammering Romania in their international friendly at Telford . Take a bow: Aidy Boothroyd got off to a perfect start in his first game as England Under 20 boss . England (4-2-3-1): Christian Walton (Brighton); Dominic Ball (Tottenham), Isaac Hayden (Arsenal), Shay Facey (Manchester City), Matt Targett (Southampton); Lewis Baker (Chelsea), John Swift (Chelsea); Callum Robinson (Aston Villa), Rolando Aarons (Newcastle), Jordon Ibe (Derby on loan from Liverpool); Chuba Akpom (Arsenal) Substitutes: Harrison Reed (Southampton) for Swift, 63; Kwame Thomas (Derby) for Akpom, 63; Josh Murphy (Norwich) for Ibe, 63; Christy Pym (Exeter City) for Walton, 79; Matt Grimes (Exeter City) for Aarons, 79; Josh Harrop (Manchester United) for Baker, 79; Lloyd Jones (Liverpool) for Facey, 79 . Substitutes not used: Fankaty Dabo (Chelsea), Paul Digby (Barnsley), Ben Pearson (Manchester United), Chris Long (Everton) Scorers: Aarons 54; Murphy 71; Robinson 73, 89; Baker 78 pen; Thomas 85 . Aarons, who impressed on his Premier League debut for Newcastle against Crystal Palace last weekend, was part of an attacking quartet that also included in-form Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom, Liverpool’s Jordon Ibe and Aston Villa man Robinson. England were on top from the first whistle but, despite seeing plenty of the ball, it took 27 minutes to muster a meaningful chance. Chelsea prodigy Baker curled a free-kick from the left corner of the box that looked bound for the top corner before goalkeeper Razvan Began tipped it over the bar. It really was a matter of time before the hosts broke the deadlock at the New Bucks Head and Aarons, who scored one and created another on his Newcastle debut at the weekend, duly obliged. Southampton’s Matt Targett and Chelsea’s John Swift combined down the left and Aarons held off his marker inside the box to fire the ball in off the post. The floodgates duly opened and England went on to score five more times within the space of 18 minutes. Boothroyd bolstered the forward line by introducing Norwich City’s Murphy, Derby’s Thomas and Southampton man Harrison Reed and Romania had no answer. On the spot: England's Lewis Baker scores with a well taken penalty after Rolando Aarons was brought down . Snap happy: England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands to watch the game . Murphy’s strike to make it 2-0 was the pick of the bunch. Targett played a 40-yard ball from left-back and Murphy, watching the ball drop over his shoulder, fired home first-time on the volley. Two minutes later, Robinson tapped in after Aarons teed him up in front of goal and any doubt over the outcome was removed. Aarons was then tripped in the box by goalkeeper Began and Baker converted the penalty with aplomb for 4-0. Back of the net: Kwame Thomas (2R) celebrates after adding to England's scoreline . Cream of the crop: Josh Murphy's strike to make it 2-0 was the best goal of the evening . A late flourish saw further goals from Thomas and Robinson as England capped a memorable victory that gives both Boothroyd and Hodgson optimism going forward. Boothroyd was understandably delighted after the rout. ‘I couldn’t have wished for a better start. I think it ends off a really good work,’ he told FA.com. ‘I knew we had the players to score, but whilst it’s 1-0 it’s always a little bit sticky and you’ve got to be super-professional and they were.’","Aidy Boothroyd got off to a perfect start as England U 20 manager .

'He is a very versatile player and I’m 100 per cent sure he will do very, very well for Arsenal. Danny is a perfect match for Arsenal. He is such a versatile player.

You look back through the history of Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and we were always keen on bringing young players through and giving them a chance. 'People keep saying about Danny Welbeck not scoring enough goals but you have to look at the people with him and in front of him and how many games has he really played in his preferred position? 'Every player that wants to builds up his confidence needs a run of games in his position and when that happens you get a flow and you keep reproducing the same performances.

"By . Chris Wheeler for MailOnline . By the time transfer deadline day arrived, Tom Cleverley’s career had reached a crossroads in every sense. Aston Villa or Everton. Sadly, his journey through the ranks at Manchester United had reached a dead end. Forced to train with the reserves at Carrington last week after manager Louis van Gaal took him to one side and informed him that the imminent arrival of Daley Blind would further limit his first-team opportunities, Cleverley knew his time was up after 14 years at the club. Little more than a month after Van Gaal handed him the honour of captaining United for the first time against Roma on pre-season tour in Denver, the England midfielder had joined the list of players earmarked for the Old Trafford exit. Kitted out: Tom Cleverley poses with an Aston Villa shirt at Bodymoor Heath on Wednesday . Smiles better: The midfielder completed a loan move from Manchester United during the transfer window . Goodbye? Cleverley in action against Sunderland last month in what could be his final United appearance . Cleverley’s subsequent departure was a little messy, to say the least. He was halfway down the M6 en route to undergo a medical at Villa on Monday after United accepted a £7.5million bid when Everton attempted to hijack the deal. That fell flat when their offer of £5.5m was rejected by United chief Ed Woodward, and Villa rushed through a loan move that was only ratified by the Premier League on Tuesday afternoon. It is safe to assume that those first fraught phone calls from Villa boss Paul Lambert and his assistant Roy Keane were less than polite. However, when the dust settles and Cleverley adjusts to his new environment at Villa Park, he may come to the conclusion that this is a not a bad career move after all. His once burgeoning reputation has taken something of a battering over the past 12 months. A player whose selfless contribution to the team was not always appreciated by supporters who demanded more from those wearing a United shirt became a prime target during United’s alarming decline under David Moyes. Played out of position and then not at all by the Scot, his confidence dipped. Scapegoat: Cleverley came to represent the Red Devils' fall from the top under David Moyes . Fall guy: A handful of England fans set up a poisonous petition against Cleverley playing for the national team . The situation took a poisonous turn in February when an online petition was set up calling for him to be axed from the England squad. Publicly, Roy Hodgson stood by Cleverley but it was perhaps no surprise that the combination of events meant that he did not go to the World Cup in Brazil. Although Van Gaal’s reputation as a coach who likes to build from within and work with younger players initially augured well for his future at United, the club’s spectacular £150m summer spending spree told otherwise. Cleverley and his old friend Danny Welbeck were out as United turned to big-name signings like Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao on astronomical wages of £280,000-a-week. That is 10 times more than Cleverley earned at Old Trafford but some still accused him of greed for haggling over his personal terms with Villa. At the age of 25, however, he knows that his next contract is likely to be the most important of his career. Where that will be remains to be seen. He will spend the rest of the season at Villa who have an option to renew their £7.5m offer in January. It is unlikely that Everton will have been discouraged by their unsuccessful attempt to sign him on Monday. Unlike Welbeck, who will earn in excess of £100,000-a-week following his £16m move to Arsenal, Cleverley has had to take a step back. In the long run, it may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. The important thing is to get his mind back on playing football at a club where he will be given every chance to shine. A player who first made his mark away from United on loan at Leicester City, Watford and Wigan must do so again. Hard as nails: United legend Roy Keane (centre right) is now assistant manager at Villa . Streetwise: The midfielder made his name while on successful loan spells at Watford and Wigan . Keane knows a thing or two about leaving United and the Irishman could be a key figure in Cleverley’s rehabilitation at Villa. The former Old Trafford skipper will relish the opportunity to rebuild the midfielder’s confidence and develop his game. This, after all, was a young man who was frequently tipped for stardom by Sir Alex Ferguson. Cleverley, who was 11-years-old when he chose Old Trafford ahead of Leeds and Blackburn, has proved United wrong before. Their academy coaches thought that he would be too small to make the grade, but he went on to play a total of 79 games for the first-team. Even though Cleverley and United have now gone their separate ways, it’s by no means the end of the road.","Tom Cleverley has joined Aston Villa on loan from Manchester United .

"By . Andy Nicol . Under new coach Vern Cotter, Scotland keep winning — so long may that continue. It has to be said that, for a second week running, there was a good bit of luck required. But how many times have we been on the wrong end of that equation? We will gladly take it. Like in the Canada game the week before, the overall performance in the 21-19 win against Argentina was not great — there were lots of errors again — but the spirit in the squad is there for all to see. Sparkling: Scotland's lock Grant Gilchrist (C) holds the ICBC Cup after a friendly against Argentina . And the good news is that it was a whole new set of players who demonstrated this attitude, as only four remained in the team that beat the Argentinians from the one that started against the Canadians. This is the reaction I was expecting from the players. Everyone will be wanting to impress the new coach and nothing does that more than people who are prepared to dig deep inside themselves for the greater good of the team. There does not seem to be any ‘superstars’ in the squad doing things for their own betterment — and this will have greatly impressed Cotter. He is a New Zealander and they don’t like players who think they are better than the team. You have only to watch Richie McCaw or Dan Carter, two of the best players in the world, and see how hard they work for the team and the amount of self-sacrifice they make to appreciate the New Zealand ethos of playing rugby. I think this aligns with how we like our ‘superstars’ in Scotland. We don’t like the flash players who take all the headlines off the pitch, as well as on it. We admire the grafters, players you hardly notice but are hugely effective on the pitch. Rob Harley is one of these. He has been outstanding for Glasgow all season and he continued that form for Scotland against  Argentina. His work rate is  phenomenal and he does all the hard work in attack and defence. Delight: Scotland's players celebrate their last-minute win against Argentina . It was a big occasion for young Grant Gilchrist, who was captaining his country for the first time at the age of 23, the youngest Scotland captain since Gregor Townsend in 1996. Gilchrist did really well, because it is a tough job to captain your country when that young. I was made skipper for the tour to Fiji, Tonga and Samoa in 1993 when I was only 22, but no caps were awarded on that tour. The hardest thing I found was looking around at team meetings and seeing the likes of Chris Gray — a Grand Slam winner three years earlier and a decade older than me — sitting there listening to me. Gilchrist would have had a similar experience last week, looking up and seeing players who had been around for years, like Ross Ford or recent Lions in Stuart Hogg and Sean Maitland but, on the evidence of what I could see on TV, he coped fine. He had some tough calls to make when Scotland were awarded two kickable penalties with the score at 19-10 and 10 minutes to play. I would have taken the kick but Gilchrist went for the lineout on both occasions, with  neither decision resulting in a try being scored. On the run: Scotland centre Nick De Luca avoids a tackle by Argentina's Matias Orlando . When Scotland won a third penalty, he opted for the kick this time, which proved to me that he was still thinking clearly, a crucial factor when captain. He also played well, which is of paramount importance when leading a side, and will have loved the experience, especially when the winning kick sailed over from Duncan Weir. What a rollercoaster for Weir at the end. He missed a relatively straightforward conversion with a poor kick and must have thought he had blown Scotland’s last chance of victory. But he was given another opportunity for glory, with a much harder kick — and he nailed that one beautifully. I love Duncan’s attitude and temperament. He does not allow what has happened before to affect his next job. I stated in this column two weeks ago that the goal for this tour would be to arrive in South Africa undefeated. The Scots have achieved this goal, albeit not playing brilliantly, but they can now have a crack at one of the best sides in the world with no pressure on them.","Cotter watched on as Scotland beat Argentina 21-19 .

"By . Mark Wilson . Under blazing sunshine in a tiny town in . Upper Austria, it took just 70 seconds for the first goal of the Ronny . Deila era to arrive. He can only hope it is an omen for the far greater . challenges that lie ahead. The . quaint little Hofmaninger Stadion in Bad Wimbsbach, with a crowd of . around 200, is a world away from the famous and imposing venues Celtic . again hope to visit in the new season’s Champions League. But . it was here that Deila began his preparations for the forthcoming vital . qualifiers and there were early signs of what he wants to see from his . side. Watching brief: Ronny Deila takes charge of his first match as Celtic manager . Celtic (4-2-3-1): Zaluska; Lustig, Van Dijk, Mulgrew, F Twardzik; Brown, Johansen; McGeouch, Commons, Boerrigter; Stokes. Subs: Fasan, Matthews, O’Connell, Waters, Findlay, Kayal, McGregor, Pukki, Griffiths, Atajic, Fridjonsson, Balde, Watt . An accomplished second-minute finish from . Anthony Stokes set the Norwegian on his way to a worthwhile victory over . opponents who finished fifth in last season’s Russian league. Operating . a 4-2-3-1 system, Deila fielded an entirely different team for each . half as he seeks to filter through his options before the first leg . against KR Reykjavik in 11 days’ time. He watched calmly but intently . from the sidelines throughout, frequently offering vocal encouragement . to those now under his charge. Deila’s . reign as the 17th permanent manager of the Parkhead club is up and . running. It was a landmark moment for the 38-year-old, but he kept his . cool amid the soaring temperatures. ‘I . didn’t feel any nerves,’ Deila insisted afterwards. ‘I was quite calm. Of course when the game starts you want to win. But I was okay. It was . good to get the first victory. ‘I can also look at the game and know there are things we need to improve - and we will work on them.’ It . didn’t take long for Deila to have a goal to celebrate. Some neat . passing out from the back saw the ball switched wide right to Mikael . Lustig. Quick-fire:Striker Anthony Stokes gets Celtic off to the best possible start with an early goal . He swept it forward from deep to send Stokes in behind a static Krasnodar defence. A nimble touch over the advancing goalkeeper provided an impressive finish to the first scoring move of a new management tenure. ‘It was good, I thought I don’t have to do anything,’ said Deila, breaking into a laugh. ‘It was a good goal as well, it was a good start but we gave them some chances when we lost the ball in dangerous areas. We have to work on being relaxed in those areas and in time that will come.’ With Efe Ambrose enjoying some time off following his World Cup exploits with Nigeria, Charlie Mulgrew was selected to partner Virgil van Dijk at the heart of the Celtic defence. There were more than a few signs of rustiness on display as Krasnodar levelled after 19 minutes. Kris Commons played Mulgrew into trouble with a poor pass and the Scotland international was unable to prevent Odil Akhmedov from scampering through to beat Lukasz Zaluska. Cool head: Stefan Johanssen (centre) rounds the keeper to score Celtic's second goal . Ricardo Laborde then sent a snip of a chance over the bar as Celtic wobbled before Zaluska was required to block out Brazilian midfielder Wanderson. The Parkhead club were back in front before the break, though, as Stefan Johansen capitalised on a defensive mix up to calmly angle home a shot. Deila opted to change his entire line-up at half-time amid punishing conditions, with a raft of youth players joined by the more experienced figures of Adam Matthews, Beram Kayal, Teemu Pukki and Leigh Griffiths. It was one of the kids who extended Celtic’s lead five minutes after the restart as Callum McGregor – who enjoyed a profitable loan spell at Notts County last season - produced a fine, sidefoot finish to despatch a Matthews cross. Setback: Celtic keeper Lukasz Zaluska fails to stop Odil Akhmedov scoring an equaliser . Krasnodar began to press more and more as the second half wore on, but Celtic goalkeeper Leo Fasan produced a clutch of impressive saves to seal a two-goal winning margin. Next up on their four-match Austrian tour is Sunday’s visit to face old foes Rapid Vienna in the capital. Deila hopes to see a process of continual improvement as he tries to imprint his style on the squad. ‘We met a very good team tonight and the result was very good, if a little bit flattering,’ he admitted. ‘We didn’t deserve to win the match as we did but we’re allowed to have good goalkeepers, as well. clear thinking: Deiladoes does his team talk on the pitch due to the intense heat . ‘There were some good attacks and the young boys in the second half played very well, the attitude was good throughout the whole match. ‘We have some way to go physically - and with the play from back – but the times we got it right we got big chances. ‘There were Celtic strips in the crowd and that tells you all about the size of the club. But I was focusing on the team and I know how I want my team to perform. ‘We are at the beginning of that and I am really looking forward to getting us the way I want. When we do that, we will play some good matches because there are a lot of good players here. We need more possession but in one year you will see a different picture to what you saw here.’","An accomplished finish from Stokes set the Norwegian on his way .

Southampton's players had a first chance to impress Ronald Koeman when they reported back for pre-season training on Wednesday - but Dani Osvaldo failed to show for the first day under their new boss. The Dutchman cast his eye over his squad after taking over from Mauricio Pochettino in the summer. A handful of the players also took part in testing at Southampton Solent University, but Osvaldo was absent from the group citing medical reasons. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Saints players put through their paces at Solent University . Tough start: James Ward-Prowse was one of the players who underwent fitness testing . Taking a breather: Ward-Prowse has a break from the medical tests . James Ward-Prowse, Jack Cork, José Fonte, Steven Davis and Paulo Gazzaniga were put through their paces and were clearly feeling the strain if these pictures are anything to go by. 'It was difficult,' Ward-Prowse told the club's website. 'Obviously VO2 max means you run to your maximum and you can’t run anymore, so it’s difficult. It stands us in good stead to go and tackle the rest of pre-season and the season beyond. Pushed to the limit: The Saints players hit the ground running on day one . Blowing: Jose Fonte takes a well-earned rest . 'In midfield you’ve got to be able to do a bit of both. You’ve got to get in the box to score goals and get back to defend. It’s a very physical, demanding position but that’s why I enjoy it.' Jack Cork added: 'It was hard. We do it nearly every season and I thought with the new gaffer coming in we might dodge it this year and get away with not having to do it! 'It’s one thing that keeps me motivated in pre-season to try and do some work because I know the first thing I’m going to do is have something like that to test me straight away. It’s hard but it helps us with all the data. Sizing them up: Steve Davis is measured by a member of the medical team . Thumbs up: Paulo Gazzaniga prepares to get checked out . 'I think it’s more just to test what level we’re at. Everyone seems to do alright. Everyone seems to finish on the same level. 'You get some a little bit higher and some a little bit lower.
