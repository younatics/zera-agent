"Manchester United have fallen off their perch. And they’re dropping like a stone towards mediocrity. That is the undeniable fact that has been hammered home relentlessly during the past six months. Whether we are talking about the events of Wednesday night at Olympiacos or before the startled eyes of the faithful at Old Trafford, the evidence is there for all to see. Can't stop the slump: David Moyes cannot believe it as he watches Manchester United lose at Olympiacos . Down and almost out: Robin van Persie lies on the floor during a defeat which sees United's Champions League campaign hanging by a thread . Disbelief: Wayne Rooney cries out in vain during another shambolic United display . Abject: The frustration shows on the Man United players' faces on taking the restart after conceding to Olympiacos . Coming to get you: Liverpool are looking to take United's place in the top four . Now is it time for Man United to sack Moyes? Out of the title race, out of the FA . Cup, out of the League Cup, out of the top four and now in desperate . need of an improbable recovery in the Champions League. On what we have all seen so far this season, who would bet upon them turning the tables? The Manchester United of seasons past, maybe. The Manchester United of Sir Alex Ferguson. The . snarling face of Roy Keane, the passion of Gary Neville, the . understated brilliance of Paul Scholes, the delivery of David Beckham. And behind it all, the aggression and defiance of Peter Schmeichel. Only those characters are no more. David Moyes is being haunted by those ghosts of the past. There is no snarling, there is no brilliance, there is certainly no delivery. Win at all costs? No, what passed before Moyes’s eyes in the Greek port city was his worst nightmare. There was more passion shown on the sidelines by Roy Keane on television than there was on the pitch. (Note . to Lisa Carrick: pick a fight that you can win. Keane was right. It was . an insipid, pathetic excuse of an interview that mirrored the . performance.) Scratching his head: Moyes rues the defeat by Olympiacos and wonders what to do next . Nowhere to hide: Rooney (left), Michael Carrick (centre) and Rio Ferdinand feel the pain of defeat . Pointless: Moyes takes out his frustration at the humiliating defeat on a match official after the match . Triumph: The Olympiacos players enjoy their famous victory over Man Utd as Danny Welbeck (left) looks on . If we start with the manager, we have to ask: has he become utterly incapable overnight? Of course not. Here . was a man who overachieved at Everton, understanding what it took to keep the club fighting it out with the big boys in the top half. But the one aspect of the managerial job that Moyes does not yet possess at Old Trafford is the fear factor. How many times was Ferguson prepared to stand toe-to-toe in the dressing room and slug it out with his players? That . fear factor, the fear of losing your place, the fear of not playing for . one of the world’s biggest clubs, the fear of being told you are not . wanted.... It looks like it doesn’t matter to half of them. Do you know what? It doesn’t any more. Protected by grotesque contracts, the lack of desire was startling. The only two who can escape criticism from Wednesday night’s display were Nemanja Vidic and Wayne Rooney. One has just signed a mammoth new pay deal. The other one is off at the end of the season. I thought Vidic was magnificent. Pointed failure: Stoke City's Charlie Adam celebrates scoring in the win over Man Utd in the Premier League . Cup shock: Swansea's Wilfried Bony (second left) celebrates knocking Man Utd out of the FA Cup at Old Trafford . Mixed emotions: Sunderland go wild after their Capital One Cup penalty win, while Adnan Januzaj suffers . But the remainder of it is sub-standard. There is an ageing spine to the team. Rio Ferdinand. Gone. Chris Smalling. Not good enough. Ditto the entire back four. And Tom Cleverley. Not Manchester United standard. You can include Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia in that bracket, too. While I can sit here and say that they aren’t good enough, that doesn’t excuse the lack of desire. Where was it? Where was that team of winners? Let’s . face it, Moyes may have inherited a poor situation, not helped by the . fact that David Gill, a steady hand on the tiller, departed at the same . time as Ferguson. But he could at least instil some pride in the shirt. This is, though, a situation that has been coming. The writing has been on the wall for a while. Yes, people point to the title race last season. But let’s look at the state United’s rivals were in. Chelsea . suffered a hangover from the Champions League. Their own end of an era. Arsenal weren’t anywhere near as strong as they are this year. And they . look like they will fall short - again. And it appears there was a player backlash against Roberto Mancini that did for him at Manchester CIty. Outspoken: Van Persie has suggested his team-mates are affecting his form by taking up his positions . On his way: Nemanja Vidic (left) is set to join Inter Milan imminently . Getting the boot: It's looking like  Ferdinand's final season at Old Trafford . Sub-standard: Tom Cleverley is not good enough for United, and neither is Ashley Young (right) How . would Manchester United’s class of 2012-13 get on this season? Hmm. Better, but not winning the crown by a country mile, that’s for sure. The . true state of the club was laid bare when Athletic Bilbao outclassed . them in the Europa League a couple of seasons ago. That really should . have set the alarm bells ringing. And how many players - apart from the front two - would other top-five Premier League teams take? That’s the level we’re talking about. And Chelsea have just off-loaded one they deem surplus to United. What’s . worse is that there isn’t anyone else any better to come in. Sergio . Aguero/David Silva isn’t standing injured on the sidelines. There are untold reasons United are struggling. But . the fact of the matter is the players aren’t good enough. The past . manager may or may not have known it. The current one most certainly . does. The truth laid bare: The real state of United was revealed when they lost to Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League in 2012 . Oscar winner: Oscar De Marcos celebrates scoring for Athletic against United in that tie . What is most chilling . is that this situation mirrors the one that Graeme Souness found himself . in when he took over at Liverpool 23 years ago. A golden generation had passed. The Scot had to rip it up and start again. And the fall-out was painful. The . rest of football now scents blood. The way they did when Anfield lost . its aura. That’s why teams such as West Brom, Swansea and Everton have . emerged from Old Trafford with what has been, until this season, . once-in-a-lifetime victories. Souness never really managed to find the right cocktail to replace a generation of giants. Moyes finds himself lagging behind Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea and, yes, Liverpool. On . a European front, Bayern Munich, PSG, Monaco and Borussia Dortmund and . the two Spanish giants would not fear this current United set-up. True leader: United are missing a great figurehead such as Roy Keane, whose snarling face, such a feature of successful past Old Trafford teams, is now only seen on ITV (below) passing judgement on current failings . Moyes needs giants. Giant characters. Giant players. It’s going to cost. But what’s the alternative? More mediocrity? Manchester United need to sign some top-quality players. Because, at the moment, apart from in one or two cases, they’re not of the quality the champions have come to expect.","Manchester United were beaten 2-0 in their Champions League first leg knockout match at Olympiacos .

"A mother whose Russian husband snatched their two sons and kept them captive for 18 months has described the moment they were finally reunited after the children were freed in a dramatic raid by Moscow police. Rachael Neustadt’s sons are now back in Britain living with their mother following a lengthy legal battle in which she won a landmark ruling in Moscow City Court that ordered her estranged husband Ilya to return Daniel, eight, and his six-year-old brother, Jonathan. When he refused and went on the run with the youngsters, police tracked him to a secluded, one-bedroom apartment in Moscow where they were hiding with his mother. Back together again: Happy Rachael Neustadt hugs sons Daniel, eight (left) and Jonathan, six (right) During the harrowing rescue the boys, who had been brainwashed into believing that their mother was an ogre who wanted to hurt them, were forced by their grandmother to scream in Russian: ‘No, no. We don’t want to go. Mama is bad.’ Speaking for the first time, Rachael, who witnessed the raid, said that when she first saw her sons after being separated from them for a year and a half, she broke down in tears. ‘I just wanted to grab them and hug them,’ she said. ‘But I didn’t want to frighten them, knowing how much they had been through and what they had been told about me.’ The boys, who were wearing only their underwear and hadn’t spoken to their mother for more than a year, had been told by their father that Rachael was a ‘baddy’ gangster who had bandits searching for them. By the time Russian authorities finally found the bolthole in which they were imprisoned, the boys hadn’t been to school for seven months and had only been allowed outside one at a time so as not to arouse suspicion. ‘When the bailiff rang the door the grandmother refused to open it,’ Rachael said. ‘She simply would not co-operate. It wasn’t until they started taking off the locks that she finally opened the door. Went on the run: Former lecturer Ilya Neustadt refused to comply with court orders and fled with his sons . ‘My son told me later that just before his grandmother opened the door she told them that the bandits had arrived and they had to “do what they had practised”. ‘When we entered the apartment she started shouting hysterically. She got them to start chanting with her in Russian, saying I was bad and they didn’t want to go. I couldn’t believe my ears. When I saw them at first they looked so delicate, yet so much bigger than in my memory. My babies had grown so much. ‘It was so calculated and cold-hearted. I was devastated for my children and shocked she could behave like this with children she supposedly loved. But it said it all about child abduction. It is cruel, selfish and manipulative. It has everything to do with power and nothing to do with love. ‘Finally the officials were able to get them all dressed and leave the apartment with them to go to the police station. Even though I was present at the collection, it was only at the police station that we were properly reintroduced.’ Today the boys are back living in Britain and have been reunited with their baby brother Meir, who is two. Clutching her boys tightly, Rachael said: ‘We took it slowly at first, but within a few hours they were returning my hugs and kisses. ‘Jonathan told me happily: “Mummy, you’re not bad! I love you!” Hearing them call me Mummy again brought tears to my eyes. Being separated from my sons was incredibly painful and I lived with anxiety every day. ‘I spent 20 hours a day on the internet and the phone. When children are stolen you fear you’ll never see them again. You pray for a miracle.’ Rachael’s ordeal began after she and Ilya married in Berlin in 2004. They moved to London in January 2011 and Ilya, who has dual Russian and German citizenship, worked as a full-time lecturer at London Metropolitan University. The couple became estranged after Ilya became controlling and bullying, and later that year they split up. Rachael, a former teacher from America, realised she was pregnant with Meir only after she had fled the family home. At first the boys were allowed supervised contact with their father, which later became a regular schedule of overnight stays and holidays. The courts approved a trip to Moscow with their father to visit his extended family in December 2012. Rachael recalled: ‘It was hard for me to imagine being separated from them for two weeks but I was trying to do the right thing.’ Then, on January 7, her worst fears were realised when she received an email from Ilya saying they would not be returning. Determined to fight for her children, Rachael set up a campaign and fundraising site on Facebook called Bring Back My Boys. Eventually two meetings were arranged, but when Rachael flew out to Russia, Ilya and the boys didn’t show. After a handful of Skype calls, Ilya cut off all access to the children. Showdown: Moscow police raided the one-bedroom apartment in Moscow, in the building pictured above, where they found the children with their grandmother . In the first year after the abduction Rachael’s case was heard in court a dozen times in two jurisdictions. Every single order made demanded that the children be returned to her immediately. But Ilya ignored them all. Then came the historic Moscow City Court ruling last September. Ilya appealed but after losing his case in November he disappeared, having earlier hidden his mother and the boys in an unregistered apartment to evade complying with the orders. With the aid of Shaw Graham Kersh Solicitors, Rachael sought an international arrest warrant for Ilya, hoping that if he were found he would be forced to reveal the location of the children. This was the first case in the UK and in Russia to use the newly ratified 1996 Hague Convention for the Protection of Children. When news came through that the apartment had been found she was overjoyed. Today, the family is returning to some semblance of normal life. ‘What amazes me is how quickly our bond was re-established, despite their father having done everything he could to eliminate me from their lives,’ she said. ‘The imprint of love from their early years was still there and still strong.’ Rachael was able to claim £40,000 in legal aid to help her battle, and more was raised through the appeal – but she is still £20,000 in debt.","Rachael Neustadt's sons - Daniel, eight and Jonathan, six - were snatched .

"Claim: Supporters of Mayor Lutfur Rahman allegedly handed out lollipops to the children of voters . Voters were promised council houses if they re-elected their mayor, a court heard yesterday. Islamic sections of the electorate were told they should be ‘good Muslims’ by voting for Mayor Lutfur Rahman, it was said. In a further bid to win votes, supporters of Mr Rahman allegedly handed out lollipops to the children of voters in Tower Hamlets, East London. A petition brought before the High Court claims the re-election of the mayor in May was fraudulent ‘in a variety of forms’. It alleges that council officers were bullied into ‘securing a certain number of votes’ and were threatened with the sack if they refused. Votes were cast in the names of people who were not ‘entitled to be on the electoral register’ and numerous postal ballots were filled in by the same person, the court heard. And false allegations that rival candidate John Biggs was a racist and anti-Islamic were circulated. Mr Rahman, who is serving a second term as the mayor of the borough, won by some 3,000 votes. The petition, brought by residents Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussain and Angela Moffat, claims that supporters of the mayor descended on 41 polling stations at night, ‘making it difficult or impossible for voters to get into the stations’. Allegations: A petition brought before the High Court (pictured) claims the re-election of the mayor in May was fraudulent 'in a variety of forms' The men were ‘telling voters that they must vote for Mayor Rahman in an intimidating manner’, the petition claims. The statement also cited concerns ‘that polling station officials folded the ballot papers in such a way to obscure one of the candidates’. James Laddie QC, acting for Mr Rahman, said his client denied all the allegations. He asked Mr Justice Supperstone and Mr Justice Spencer to dismiss the petition. The four petitioners are seeking a trial date so that their petition can be heard in full. The hearing continues.","Islamic voters allegedly told to be 'good Muslims' by electing Lutfur Rahman .

"The 15-year-old cousin of a Palestinian boy who was burned to death in Israel has been badly beaten and arrested while protesting about his relative's death. Mohammed Abu Khder, 16, was burned to death in a suspected attack by Israeli extremists in revenge for the killing of three Jewish teenagers abducted in the West Bank recently. Now family members say Abu Khder's cousin Tariq Abu Khder, 15, has been badly beaten by Israeli police while being arrested during a protest sparked by Abu Khder's death. Footage has emerged on social media showing border guards savagely beating a youth, thought to be Tariq, before dragging his semi-conscious body away. Scroll down for video .

Meanwhile . an autopsy on Abu Khder's body has shown smoke was inhaled into his lungs, . suggesting that the teen was still alive and breathing while he was . being burned. Palestinian . news agency Maan quoted Attorney General Mohammed Aluweiwi Saturday as . saying the initial findings of a post-mortem indicated the presence of . smoke in the boy's lungs. Abu . Khder also suffered a head wound, but that did not cause his death, . Aluweiwi added. Israeli police said Saturday they still could not . confirm the motive for his murder.

Tariq is a US citizen who studies in Florida and was on vacation in east Jerusalem at the time of the attack. The US consulate has not yet responded to news of his arrest . Triq's . parents say they have seen their son in hospital and were told he was . arrested for being masked. A police spokesman said a slingshot was found . on him used for hurling rocks at officer. The spokesman added that Tariq had been violent and resisted arrest, saying that six police were also hurt during the protests. Abu Khder was abducted from his . Shuafat neighbourhood in occupied east Jerusalem early Wednesday and his . charred body found not long after in a west Jerusalem forest. The . killing has sparked days of angry and often violent protests across the . country. Clashes fuelled by anger over the case have spread into Arab . Israeli towns. Post-mortem tests on the body of Mohammed Abu Khder, 16, showed they boy inhaled smoke - meaning he was alive while he was being burned to death . Tensions also remained high on Israel's reinforced southern border with the Gaza Strip. Gaza militants fired at least 10 rockets at Israel, injuring a soldier lightly and causing some damage to infrastructure, the military said. It said it had launched several airstrikes in Gaza overnight against sites used by the militant group Hamas. Israeli leaders have widely condemned the killing of the Palestinian youth, and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed those responsible would be brought to justice. Palestinians took to the streets in protests after news of the boy's death on Wednesday and clashed with police in east Jerusalem. Riots erupted in east Jerusalem yesterday as thousands of Palestinians massed for the boy's burial. The . violence spread to Arab towns in northern Israel early today, with . protesters throwing rocks at passing cars, burning tyres and lobbing . rocks and firebombs at police, who responded with tear gas and stun . grenades, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. Near the . town of Qalansawe, protesters also pulled over a car driven by an . Israeli Jew, pulled him out and set the vehicle on fire, Ms Samri said. The driver was not injured. More than 20 people were arrested before the unrest subsided in the afternoon, she said.

Riots erupted in east Jerusalem yesterday as thousands of Palestinians massed for the boy's burial . Israeli Arabs, unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, hold citizenship rights. But they often face discrimination and mostly identify with the Palestinians. Palestinian protesters in Jerusalem also used an electric saw to damage the light rail that connects the heavily Arab populated eastern sector of the city with the mostly Jewish West, Ms Samri said. The chaos began after three Israeli teenagers, one of whom was a US citizen, were abducted in the West Bank on June 12, sparking a huge manhunt that ended with the gruesome discovery of their bodies earlier this week.","Mohammed Abu Khder, 16, abducted and burned to death on Wednesday .

"It may have made its way up the pole to become one of Britain's most famous chain of lap dancing clubs, but when it comes down to the actual financials Spearmint Rhino appears to be getting a little hot under the collar. For the company, which runs five adult entertainment clubs across the country, has filed accounts showing that it made a loss of £2.1million in 2011. The drop is far greater than the £733,265 loss recorded in 2010. Not in pole position: Spearmint Rhino has recorded a loss of £2.1m for 2011 . This is all despite pulling in a considerable £9.9m in revenue, up from £8.5m the previous year. And despite the losses, UK boss John Sprecht, who once famously suggested that struggling students should strip their way through college, kept his salary the same at £304,000. According to the UK operations' accounts, the profit loss was a result of writing off £2.5m of goodwill and debts to other businesses within the group and the results were ""considered satisfactory by the directors given the prevailing economic conditions."" Working up the pole: Despite losses, Spearmint Rhino plans to expand and take on 60 new dancers . Other factors included rising administration costs, ill-fated business ventures and the departure of the American founder of Spearmint Rhino, John Gray, who left the UK business in April. The accounts also reveal that the company owes HM Revenue and Customs more than £2m, which it has agreed to repay under a ""time to pay"" agreement. It also seems the chain also owes almost £3m to Spearmint Rhino Worldwide Inc, which owns 12 clubs in the US. Despite the losses, Spearmint Rhino says it has plans to expand and take on 60 new dancers and only last week the company applied to run the country's first 24-hour lap dancing club at its Tottenham Court Road venue.

Diego Costa was one of the 22 Chelsea players who left London for Slovenia on Tuesday ahead of the Champions League Group G clash at Maribor. Chelsea beat Maribor 6-0 two weeks ago during a four-game absence for Costa, who returned from his persistent hamstring problems to play in last Saturday's defeat of QPR. Striker Loic Remy (groin) and midfielder John Obi Mikel (knee) are the only injury absentees, while third-choice goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer is ineligible for Champions League competition. Striker Didier Drogba could start against Maribor if manager Jose Mourinho chooses to rotate his squad . France striker Remy is likely to be out until after the forthcoming international break. Blues boss Jose Mourinho may rotate his Barclays Premier League-leading side, with Saturday's match at Liverpool in mind. But he was less than impressed by the performance of his fringe players in the Capital One Cup defeat of League Two Shrewsbury last week, so he must get the balance of selection right to record Chelsea's third win from four matches in this season's competition. The squad is the same which played QPR, plus Cesar Azpilicueta, the full-back who has now completed his three-match domestic suspension for his dismissal at Crystal Palace. Victory may secure the 2012 winners' place in the last 16, depending on the result in Schalke's match with Sporting Lisbon.

"Lord Turner: 'Innovative policies' A row erupted last night after a favourite to take over the Bank of England appeared to suggest that billions of pounds of government debt should be written off. Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, set alarm bells ringing when he called for ‘more innovative and unconventional policies’ to kick-start the economy. He warned that quantitative easing, the Bank of England’s controversial money printing programme designed to boost growth, now has ‘little impact’. Lord Turner – a frontrunner to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank – did not spell out what was required instead in his Mansion House speech on Thursday night. But it is thought one option could involve the Bank telling the Treasury it does not have to repay all the £375billion of government bonds it has bought through QE – effectively cancelling the debt. Such a move would be seen as creating ‘helicopter money’ – a term for when governments print money to finance spending as though dropping cash out of the sky. Sources close to Lord Turner insisted it was ‘completely wrong’ to suggest he advocated such a policy. ‘Adair [Lord Turner] is not pushing or suggesting any particular policy ideas,’ one said yesterday. But his speech sparked outrage with critics warning that cancelling the debt would shatter the Government’s economic credibility and drive up inflation. It also cast doubt over Lord Turner’s chances of taking over as Bank governor next year. ‘His credentials aren’t good enough to look after petty cash in a tobacco kiosk,’ said Peter Hargreaves, co-founder of stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown. Desperate measures: Critics said if the Bank of England let the Government off its debts it would be disaster for the economy . ‘He’s done a poor job at the FSA and he made the wrong call on the euro. The guy is very intelligent but has no common sense.’ Tory MP Andrea Leadsom warned that if the Bank ‘let off’ the Government over its debts it would be a disaster for the economy. ‘The reality is that if you cancel the debt you debase the currency,’ she said. ‘The whole reason we have kept our credit rating and the market is still buying our debt is that we have credibility and investors believe that the Government is going to pay its way out of our economic woes.’ The Bank of England distanced itself from the idea yesterday, pointing out that Sir Mervyn said in August that ‘cancelling the bonds’ would be ‘appalling behaviour’. The QE programme was launched in 2009 in an attempt to drag the economy out of recession. Critics claim it has destroyed the retirement plans of a million workers by driving down annuity rates. n Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker last night warned of  an ‘uncontainable’ backlash if taxpayers are forced to bail out banks again. ‘The objective is to get to a position where public money is never used to provide support for a bank failure,’ he told the Institute for International Finance in Tokyo. If Adair Turner believes the Government should be let off the hook for its QE debt, then it would be very dangerous to let him anywhere near the top job at the Bank of England, writes Ruth Sunderland. He has made no secret of his desire to step into the shoes of Sir Mervyn King, pictured right, and it would make for an eye-catching job application: ‘Hire me, Mr Osborne, and I’ll forget the £375billion of QE money you owe the Bank’. Lord Turner’s aides yesterday denied that he is proposing to cancel QE borrowings. But he has apparently briefed BBC business editor Robert Peston and there was a remarkably well-informed piece this week by a leading Guardian columnist, vaunting Turner as a ‘breath of fresh air’. That article mentioned Turner’s ‘private view’ that the UK should look at ‘monetising’  debt and consider ‘blatantly printing money’. QE involves the Bank creating money and using it to buy up gilts, or government debt, from pension funds and banks. The money that flows into the wider economy then, in theory, stimulates growth. Printing money to finance the Government’s debts may sound like an easy and tempting solution, but many serious economists would condemn it as the fast-track to ruin. It’s not so very different  from you or  I paying our mortgages by  setting up a counterfeiting press in the back bedroom – and similarly, it is probably not even legal. Money printing followed by debt default is behaviour associated with a banana republic. As well as the risk of unleashing rampant inflation, it would jeopardise our reputation on the money markets as a credit-worthy country. Pensioners, who have already seen their life-savings depleted by QE, would suffer even more. It would also make a mockery of attempts to control runaway public spending. Why bother, if the bills need never be paid? It is not only the  economics of the madhouse, it is morally bankrupt.","Lord Turner said the Bank of England’s controversial money printing programme had failed to boost growth .

Silva becomes the third player to agree new terms in recent months after Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov committed their futures to the Premier League champions, and Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany are expected to be next. Silva has won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and Capital One Cup since joining City for £24m from Valencia four years ago. Now the mercurial Spain midfielder wants to conquer Europe. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Silva signs new five-year City deal . Deal me in: David Silva (right) has agreed to sign a new five-year contract with Manchester City . Main man: Silva has been an integral part of the Manchester City side since joining from Valencia in 2010 . VIDEO Silva signs new five-year City deal . Asked what he wants to win before his new deal expires in 2019, he said: ‘The Champions League definitely. It’s a title I really want to win. I think we are on a good path and hopefully we can win it some day. It’s a good challenge for this year. We also want to win other titles. We want to fight for every trophy. ‘I think we are doing things well. We won the Premier League and the Capital One Cup last season and we have to continue like this. We are signing good players and I’m sure we will fight for titles.’ Silva, who is believed to be on a wage package worth £200,000 a week, admitted that he didn’t have to think twice when City approached him over a new deal. ‘It was a straightforward decision to extend my stay here and spend my peak years at Manchester City, a club with unbelievable fans who have always supported me,’ he added. ‘From the moment I joined the club four years ago it has felt like a second home to me. On and off the pitch, I feel incredibly content and fulfilled professionally and personally, so why wouldn’t I want to stay and keep winning trophies with this fantastic team? Champions: Silva helped City to a second Premier League title last season . ‘Over the last four years, we have achieved so much together, establishing City as a dominating force in England and now, when I look around this dressing-room, I can see no reason why we won’t become one of the top teams in the world.’ As well as re-signing their key players to new contracts, City have also spent close to £50m this summer on Eliaquim Mangala, Willy Caballero, Fernando and Bruno Zuculini. Bacary Sagna has moved from Arsenal as a free agent and Frank Lampard is on a six-month loan from City’s US franchise New York City. ‘They are all great players,’ said Silva. ‘The club is doing very well signing very good players and I’m sure they will give a lot to the team. That’s also good for competition. Every time there is competition the level is higher. ‘Lampard has a lot of experience. He is a great player and I’m sure he will give his best and give a lot to the team.’","David Silva has signed a new five-year deal .

"Busty glamour model Lacey Wildd has raised $23,000 in donations from fans to take her size triple-L breasts up to Q cup. The 45-year-old, mother-of-six, from Miami, Florida, told the Sun Sentinel that the operation, her thirteenth in total, is set for early 2014. Plastic surgeons will insert implants weighing a total of 42pounds into her chest, seeing her claim title to the largest augmented breasts in the world. Living out her dreams: Busty glamour model Lacey Wildd has raised $23,000 in public donations to take her size triple-L breasts up to a Q cup . Currently the top spot is held by Maxi Mounds, who wears a U.S. size 42M bra. Ms Wildd said that she is ‘nervous’ about her surgery, paid for by internet donations, as medical experts have repeatedly warned her it’s not safe. Her chest is already so heavy at 21pounds, that she had to have an internal bra made of pigskin and her own muscle implanted into her torso. But the bubbly blonde insists that her ambition to increase the size of her breasts is actually for her children's welfare. Bigger? Ms Wildd said that she is 'nervous' about her surgery, paid for by internet donations . Embarrassing mum: Lacey Wildd's children - from left Brandan, Michael, Jenaveve, and Tori - desperately want her to stop having surgery . ‘I want to leave a legacy to my . children,' says Ms Wildd, who has six children ranging in age from six . to 29, plus a 25-year-old stepson. ‘My goal was never to be famous. My goal was to be able to take care of them, to be able to support them.’ ‘My goal was never to be famous. My goal was to be able to take care of my children, to be able to support them' She said growing up she was one of six children, and her mother was so poor they couldn’t afford a house with electricity or running water. ‘I want to provide for my kids and pay for a college education, so they have opportunities I didn't have,’ Ms Wildd previously said. With the additional TV appearances, film work and subscriptions to her website, laceywildd.net, she says her income has ‘quadrupled' since 2012 and she plans on retiring in three years time. However, Ms Wildd’s children, four of . which still live at home, say that her looks have seen them face . cyber-bullying and teasing at school. Transformation: As a child Ms Wildd says she . used to be a brunette tomboy, left, but today she is a peroxide blonde glamor model . Her . daughter Tori Glynn, 18, who appeared with her on MTV's True Life, . said: ‘She is kind of like too much, and she's not taking into . consideration that this is your project, this is your thing and not all . of ours.’ Tori and her siblings are also concerned about their mother’s health, and fear bigger implants will cause terrible side-effects such as stretching, tearing, or even an infection that might kill her. Tori previously said: 'I don't want my mom to have her boobs made any bigger. Living the high life: With the additional TV appearances, film work and subscriptions to her website, laceywildd.net, Ms Wildd says she has 'quadrupled' her income from 2012 . 'I think she isn't really thinking about our opinions. What if she dies? Is she taking that into consideration? 'Does she really care that her kids could be left alone?' Despite her children's concerns, Ms Wildd, real name Paula Simonds, is determined to have the procedure - which will take her closer towards her goal of becoming the world's biggest breasted model. 'It will increase my fame and earning . power considerably. I want to make the most of this opportunity, to give . my kids a good lifestyle.' Then and now: Lacey Wildd in 1990 after her first operation, left, and after surgery in 2001 . She has already made sacrifices due to her breast size: she can no longer exercise or even pick up her youngest daughter. She is forced to sleep on her side hugging a pillow because the weight of the implants is too heavy on her chest and she cannot have mammograms, instead having to rely on sonograms. Growing up in Illinois, Ms Wildd used to be a thin, brunette waitress and became a mother of two in her late teens. Cosmetic surgery carries the same general risks as all operations, including infection and blood clots. There's also a risk of bleeding and scarring. Problems that can occur immediately after breast reconstruction surgery include infection, fluid under the wound and pain and discomfort. If the area around the breast implant becomes repeatedly infected or fluid keeps building up, the implant may need to be removed. Sometimes, the flap of tissue that is used to make a new breast can die and will need to be surgically removed. Long-term problems that can develop after breast reconstruction surgery include the implant hardening and changing shape, fluid leaks from the implant making lymph glands swell and unequal-sized breasts due to changes in weight. 'I . wasn't making as much money as the blonde girls with the big boobs. I . had two kids to take care of on my own,' she Ms Wildd who has worked as a . tattoo artist, a veterinarian assistant and a marketer. Using . money from waiting on tables, ma Wildd saved up money for her first . implant, and at 21, she expanded from an A cup to a D. 'That . was the day that changed my life. It gave me a lot more confidence. The . way people noticed me. People wanted to be around me. I turned myself . into a Barbie,' she told the newspaper. She eventually moved to Las Vegas, where she worked as a showgirl and continued developing her figure. At . 26, she plumped up to a double D cup and three years later, she became a . triple D and had six more operations to expand her breast size. At 24 she increased to a K cup and last year, she ballooned to an L cup. The . surgery-addicted model, says she prepares her skin before implants to . avoid the risks of rupturing, and take every care to avoid dangerous . infections. Along with . breast augmentations, Ms Wildd has also had two tummy tucks, four full . body liposuctions, ab sculpting, lip implants, bottom implants and two . bottom lifts. Cosmetic and . reconstructive surgeon Dr Alberto Gallerani, based in Miami, previously . warned that Ms Wildd may be suffering from body dysmorphic disorder and . should not have further breast implants. 'The skin around her breasts is already extremely thin, and it would be too dangerous for her to undergo more surgery,' he said. Addicted: The glamour model has had 12 breast enlargements as well as tummy tucks, bottom implants and silcone implants in her lips . ‘I would advise she reconsider and seek help for her surgery obsession.' But Ms Wildd insists next year’s operation will be her last one. She . told the Sun Sentinel: ""My major goal is to actually retire the boobs. I . never really wanted to be known for my boobs, I guess my boobs made me . famous. ‘I know a lot of people worry that I am hurting myself or my kids. I promise you, I am not.’","The surgery will see Lacey Wildd, 45, claim title to the largest augmented breasts in the world .

"Filter: New BT customers will have to actively chose whether to have Parental Control filters when they subscribe to the company's broadband service (library image) BT has announced all new customers will have parental control filters switched on when they subscribe to its broadband service. The company has offered the free Parental Controls service for a number of years, but this is the first time new customers will have to actively choose whether to turn the filters off. During the set-up process, a box that turns on the controls - which block a number of sites including pornography, those containing self-harm and violence as well as hate sites - will be automatically ticked. Subscribers will then have to actively turn the blocks off and instead decide what level of protection - if any - they require. The company will also extend its filter service to all internet devices including games consoles and tablets. Previously parents could only block potentially harmful sites on desktops and laptops. BT will also be contacting all of its existing customers from the start of next year, forcing them to make a choice about the level of controls on their broadband. There will be three set filter levels – strict, moderate and light - which can be customised to suit each individual family’s needs. Additional websites can be added to the list to be allowed or blocked. The filter can be turned off at specific times - acting like a 'watershed'. The account holder’s credentials are required to set up and change any of the settings as to avoid young people simply turning the service off. Every change results in a confirmation email being sent to the adult account holder, also. Pete Oliver, MD Consumer Commercial Marketing and Digital, said: 'BT takes the issue of online child protection extremely seriously and we are very pleased to be able to launch the whole-home filter to help parents keep their families safe online. 'It adds to the many tools we already make available for free to our customers.' Changes: As well as laptops and desktop machines, BT's filters will protect children on tablets and games consoles . In November, it was announced that all 20million families with an internet connection would be forced to say whether they wanted access to online pornography among dangerous sites within a matter of months. BT joins other providers TalkTalk and Sky who make all new customers make a choice on whether the filters should be switched on or off when they sign up. The Daily Mail has campaigned to make family-friendly filters ‘default on’ to help protect a children. There has been growing alarm at evidence that a third of youngsters have accessed online pornography by the time they are ten years old. Six in ten parents say they are worried or very worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web.","New customers will have to actively chose to turn parental controls off .

"When not even the Prime Minister can afford a decent umbrella then you know for certain that the economy is in trouble. Truly painting a picture of austerity Britain David Cameron is is forced to use a broken umbrella to shelter Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and himself against the rain earlier today. Mr Cameron was seen speaking to Ms Suu Kyi, and icon for the Myanmar fight for democracy, in the ground of the Prime Minister's country residence, Chequers, in Ellesborough, Buckinghamshire. Looking for a brighter future: David Cameron points at the horizon perhaps in a hope that it has fully functioning umbrellas . Aung San Suu Kyi and David Cameron continue their walk under the broken brolly in the Chequers' garden. Whether the Prime Minister implemented budget cuts to fix it has not yet been confirmed . The Prime Minister is seen talking to . Ms Suu Kyi and showing her the grounds underneath a broken umbrella – . perhaps a sign of the times. After . a lunch together Mr Cameron and Ms Suu Kyi went for a walk in the Rose . Gardens following their lunch together and were later joined by the . Prime Minister’s wife Samantha. It is the Myanmar pro-democracy leader’s first trip to Europe since her house arrest began in 1988.

The trio poses on the doorstep of Chequers which has been the official country residence of the serving British Prime Minister since 1921 . During her four day visit to the UK she has so far met with the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street, planted a tree with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and become the first foreign woman to address both houses of Parliament. Delivering the history speech in Westminster  yesterday the Nobel peace laureate . said she was seeking practical help to address the problems still besetting her . country. Ms Suu Kyi shares a moment of laughter with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House yesterday . She appealed to Britain ‘as . friend and an equal’ to support the people of Burma in their drive for . democracy. In particular, she said she hoped the UK could help rebuild . the education system while providing new investment for the future. Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi delivers an historic address to both Houses of Parliament, in Westminster Hall, in the Houses of Parliament this afternoon . ‘I am here in part to ask for practical help, help as a . friend and an equal, in support of the reforms which can bring better lives, . greater opportunities, to the people of Burma who have been for so long . deprived of their rights and their place in the world,’ she said. ‘My country today stands at the start of a journey towards, . I hope, a better future. So many hills remain to be climbed, chasms to be . bridged, obstacles to be breached. ‘Our own determination can get us so far. The support of the . people of Britain and of peoples around the world can get us so much further.’ Ms Suu Kyi, who received a standing ovation from MPs and . peers in a packed Westminster Hall, said the key to reform was the . establishment of a strong parlimentary institution. She said that after 49 years of direct military rule, it . would take time for the country’s fledgling parliament to find its feet and its . voice. She said Burma had not yet entered the ranks of truly democratic . countries but added: ‘I am confident we will get there before too long, with . your help.’ A .

Britain would invest money and people in Burma’s emerging . democracy, he said, including a delegation of MPs and peers visiting the . country next month to 'scope the potential' for building the process.

Appeal: Ms Suu Kyi called on Britain to help Burma become a truly democratic country . 'In a world beset by problems and difficulties, your example . of courage and determination has shone through,' he told her. 'If the Burmese people now fulfil their dreams, your country . will be a light in the darkness for all people who struggle for the freedom . that you ought to see for your country.” Mr Cameron defended his decision to invite Mr Sein to .

"Four children found after going on the run with their mother in Wales have written letters begging not to be made to live with their father in Spain. As their mother, Jennifer Jones, was held by police, family members released hand-written notes they claim prove a judge was wrong to order them to be sent away. In one, Jessica, 14, writes to the judge: 'I am not happy at all... I do not want to go back to Spain,' underlining the word 'not'. Found: Jennifer Jones's children (back) Jessica and Sara, (front) Tomas, Eva and David . English language teacher Jennifer Jones (left) and the father of the four children Tomas Palacin Cambra (right) Jessica's note to the judge in her parents' custody battle . She adds that she is 'scared' to be with her father and is 'finally feeling brave enough to speak up for myself'. In another, nine-year-old Eva writes . to her mother that she  wants to 'live with you in Wales for ever', . while a Mother's Day card signed by all the children says that 'we must . keep strong' and 'will be together'. Miss Jones, 45, her partner John . Williams and her children Jessica, Tomas, 12, Eva and David, eight, were . yesterday discovered safe and well in Gwent, Wales, after 30 hours on . the run. They left grandmother Brynelda Jones's . house in Llanelli in the early hours of Tuesday after a judge ordered . the children be sent to Majorca to live with their father. Miss Jones and Mr Williams, a builder in his 40s, were arrested and are being interviewed at a local police station. Miss Jones, an English language . teacher, faces a possible jail sentence for being in contempt of court . by 'abducting' her children. She will appear at the High Court today. Heart-felt: A letter sent by Jennifer Jones's children to their mother . From left:  David, Eva, Tomas, Sarah and Jessica Palacin Jones . During their time on the run, Miss . Jones told family members she had acted drastically to 'protect' her . children from their father, Spanish Lieutenant Colonel Tomas Palacin . Cambra, who she claims was abusive towards her and the children. He . denies the claims. Miss Jones has fought a bitter custody . battle with her former husband since their 12-year marriage ended in . 2008. She has tried to run away with the children once before. Their father was granted custody in . the Spanish courts, but the children return to Wales to spend the summer . holidays with Miss Jones and her family. Last week she failed to send them back, and a High Court judge ordered her to return them to Spain by midnight on Friday. She failed to do so, and lost an . appeal on Monday. But when police officers and social workers went to . her home the family had disappeared. At a hearing on Tuesday, Mr Justice . Roderic Wood said he was 'very concerned about the children', launching a . national hunt for the runaway mother. After they were found yesterday, . grandmother Brynelda Jones, 78, said returning them to Spain would be . 'like sending lambs to the lion's den'. Order: Justice Roderic Wood said he was 'concerned' about the children's welfare as a watch was being kept on ports and airports . Blessed: Her children wrote 'we will be together' with red and black hearts in a mother's day card . Family members released these hand-written notes they claim prove a judge was wrong to order them to be sent away . 'They want to be together with their mother,' she added. 'In the house they were living in [in Spain] they wrote all over the walls: ""We want to live in Wales"". 'I spoke to her yesterday. It seems . ages ago. She spoke and said, ""don't worry mum. The children are safe. Of course they are safe. They are with their mother, protecting them. And I don't want them to go back to be with their father. I want them to . be heard. 'I did this to protect them, they . don't want to go back to Spain. I love them – as a mum what else can I . do?' Last night Mr Palacin Cambra, 52, said Miss Jones had 'persuaded' the children to make false allegations about his treatment of them in an . attempt to win a custody battle. 'My concern all along was for my children's welfare. I am relieved and delighted they have been found safe,' he added. 'I love mammy': A hand-drawn card from Jessica to her mother . 'Together forever': More notes that appear to have been written by one of the children in a school book . Mrs Jones said the children had . written to her and her daughter frequently, making it clear that they . want to live with their mother. Jessica had also written to the judge. Mrs Jones said Jessica had threatened to create a huge fuss, kicking and screaming on the plane if she was forced to return. In a letter written two weeks ago to . the judge, she added: 'I love my mum and dad but I'm just trying to do . things right and to say the truth.' In a note to her mother she wrote: 'You're the best mum in the world! Thanks for everything.' A note from Eva states: 'I wish to go to Wales soon.' After three kisses, she adds: 'P.S. Wales is the best.' Daughter Sara, who is in Spain with . her father, wrote to her grandmother: 'I really miss you and wish I was . in Wales. It's going to be my birthday wish.' A hand-drawn birthday card to Jennifer Jones from her children writing that they hope to be living in Wales with her soon . Miss Jones met her former husband 16 years ago when she was working in Tenerife, where he was stationed an Army captain. They married and lived in Spain until they divorced. His lawyer Carolina Marin Pedreno, . said under the Hague Convention and European regulations the UK court . was obliged to return the children to Spain. She said the judge, having studied a . report, had ruled the children had no genuine objections to returning to . live with their father and had merely expressed a preference for living . with their mother. Before returning to Britain, the . children's address in Majorca was listed as an army barracks in the . centre of the capital of island's capital, Palma.

"Out of sorts: Czech president Milos Zeman . scratches his head at a public display of the crown jewels in . the St Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle . The new Czech president has denied being drunk in a video of a state event which shows him clearly the worse for wear. Footage shows Milo Zeman propping himself up against a wall, struggling to negotiate a step and being helped by a cardinal at a rare and highly-ceremonial public display of the Czech crown jewels last week. The president makes no secret of his drinking. But on this occasion his office insisted he simply had a virus and subsequently needed a day or two of rest. Since then, the video has prompted a storm of social media gags. Czechs - by far the biggest beer drinkers in the world per capita - have been posting pictures of themselves in bars getting drunk with slogans like, 'Here I am getting a virus', or 'Heading out for a virus'. His taste for the hard stuff does not go down well with all Czech voters though. One commenter on a YouTube clip showing the footage called the president a 'disgrace', while another said: 'This makes me wanna cry... whole world will laugh again.' Mr Zeman, 68, a chain smoker and lover of fatty foods, often extols the virtues of booze. On one occasion, he praised Winston Churchill for his love of whisky and pointed out that Adolf Hitler was a teetotaler and vegetarian - 'and you know how he ended up.' During a 1996 election campaign he said his campaign bus 'drove on gas and Becherovka,' a popular Czech liquor. Two years later he became prime minister. Scroll down for video . Overcome with patriotism? Mr Zeman, standing next to Cardinal Dominik Duka, Archbishop of Prague, inspects the Crown of Saint Wenceslas at Prague Castle. His performance has sparked a wave of online gags . 'Judge for yourself: Miroslava Nemcova, far left, the speaker for Parliament's lower house and one of seven holders of the keys to the crown jewels, was the only person to comment on Mr Zeman's condition . A tabloid in the Czech Republic once . claimed he told the paper he would drink on average six glasses of wine - . plus three shots - on any given day. It looked as if he may have had several more on the day of the viewing of the crown jewels. He is seen fighting to keep his head up and his eyes open. As he peers over the jewels, he leans heavily over the altar at Prague Castle's St Vitus Cathedral on which they are arrayed. In video of the event broadcast on Czech TV, Mr Zeman can be seen closing his eyes in front of the cameras . As he stumbled into the chamber where the crown jewels are kept, he had to prop himself up against a wall . As he peers over the jewels, he leans heavily over the altar at St Vitus Cathedral on which they are arrayed . And as he walks away, he has trouble with a small step and needs to lean on to a chair for support . And it is not the first time that Mr . Zeman had been apparently inebriated in public. Another video of Mr . Zeman taken earlier this year shows aides forced to help him . clamber from his car as he arrives at an event. His effusive geniality in this film suggests that, this time at least, he was not suffering from a virus. But something is clearly wrong as he . stumbles over a step and nearly slams face first into the floor, just . managing to catch himself on a chair where he slumps down and lights a . restorative cigarette. In a video of another occasion uploaded to YouTube, Mr Zeman can be seen stumbling up some stairs . The video then shows aides forced to help him clamber to his feet from a car seat arriving at another event . Officials rush to help the Czech president as he stumbles down some steps and towards a chair . He catches himself at the last minute, then slumps into the comfortable leather seat and lights a cigarette . Mr Zeman's unsuccessful rival in this . year's presidential election, the nobleman Karel Schwarzenberg, couldn't . help but take a swipe at his opponent's taste for alcohol. 'Milos . Zeman was in my opinion one of the most intelligent prime ministers . this country has ever had,' Schwarzenberg said during the campaign. 'And had he not drunk so much he'd have been a really good prime minister.' Bur Mr Zeman insists he's so used to . drinking that it never has any ill effects, and he has openly challenged . anyone to prove otherwise. 'If anyone has ever seen me drunk in my life, tell me when,' he said during the presidential election campaign. Miroslava Nemcova, the speaker for Parliament's lower house and one of seven holders of the keys to the Czech crown jewels, was the only person at last week's event to comment on Zeman's appearance.

"Crown Prince Felipe ascended to the Spanish throne at the stroke of midnight, after his father King Juan Carlos tearfully signed his own abdication into law. By royal standards, the ascension of King Felipe and his wife Queen Letizia was humble affair, with reception guests served hot and cold tapas-style nibbles, to be eaten while standing. There was no champagne, just sparkling cava wine from Spain's Catalonia region. The economic crisis that has left a quarter of Spaniards out of work prompted Europe's newest king to be relatively frugal at his proclamation. Scroll down for videos .

King Juan Carlos signs the constitutional law as Queen Sofia  looks on . Princess Letizia looked glamourous at the ceremony in a simple black and cream outfit . Juan Carlos yesterday signed legislation, approved by Parliament earlier this month, setting out the legal framework for the handover. The retiring monarch, who underwent a hip replacement operation last November, used a walking cane and moved with difficulty during the televised signing ceremony. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy immediately ratified the law, which went into force at midnight in Spain. Felipe is to be formally proclaimed monarch and swear an oath at a ceremony with lawmakers in Parliament later today. It will be a no-frills event, though the 18th-century Spanish crown and 17th-century scepter will be on display. After a brief military parade, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia will take a drive through expected crowds along some of Madrid's most emblematic streets and monuments - such as the Prado Museum and the Cibeles fountain.

During . most of his reign, the monarch was held in high esteem for his role in . helping steer the country from military dictatorship to democracy. He . took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime . dictator General Francisco Franco, and then endeared himself to many by . making army rebels stand down during an attempted military coup in . 1981.

"Gerard Depardieu has been banned from driving for six months and fined 4,000 Euros for drink driving. The ban follows an incident in November last year when the actor, 64, fell off his scooter and was taken to a police station drunk. Depardieu's lawyer, Eric de Caumont, . said he planned to appeal Friday's ruling. He said his client, who was . not at the hearing, was in Moscow filming. Ban: Gerard Depardieu, pictured at the Russian Film Festival earlier this week, has been disqualified from driving for six months . Fall: The French actor slightly injured his elbow after falling off his scooter drunk in November last year . The Frenchman has publicly feuded . with France's Socialist government over high taxes and has accepted a . Russian passport offered by Vladimir Putin. He was pictured leaving a police . station in Paris the morning after his scooter incident, in which he . slightly injured his elbow, last autumn. Dressed in a sleeveless white shirt, . the actor was well enough to jump back onto the vehicle and drive . himself home following the overnight stay. Unharmed: Following a night at a Parisian police station, actor Gerard Depardieu was ready to get back on his scooter . In trouble again: The . Green Card star tested positive for alcohol after the incident . Agence France-Presse reported that . when police arrived at the scene and tested Depardieu, he showed a blood . alcohol level of 1.8 grams per litre, well above the French limit for . driving of 0.5. He was detained and brought to a police station where he could face . misdemeanour charges 'after a period of sobering up,' the source told . the French news agency. In 1998 the actor was involved in a motorcycle crash when his blood-alcohol level was five times over the legal limit. He escaped with leg and face injuries.

Feud: Depardieu has shown his public disapproval with high taxes brought in by France's Socialist government by moving to Russia after he was offered a passport by Russian president Vladimir Putin . An official from the prosecutor's officer said: 'There was a confrontation and the driver filed a complaint.'

"Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool - Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Bernabeu . A glance at the tweets, forum postings and comments coming out of Merseyside would suggest that Brendan Rodgers still has more Liverpool fans for him than against. So the jury is split. To those who say Rodgers ran up the white flag in Madrid, the case for the defence would point to the result. A 1-0 defeat, against Real, Ronaldo and all. Pats on the back all round. Whichever way you look at it, Rodgers’s decision to ‘rest’ his best players for a Champions League tie of huge importance was a brave one. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rodgers 'not bothered' by selection criticism . Brendan Rodgers stands stony-faced on the touchline at the Bernabeu during Liverpool's 1-0 defeat . Regular starters Steven Gerrard (left), Glen Johnson (centre) and Jordan Henderson watch on from the bench . Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend. Liverpool starting XI v Newcastle: . Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Balotelli . Liverpool starting XI v Real Madrid: . Mignolet, Manquillo, Toure, Skrtel , Moreno; Can, Lucas 7; Lallana, Allen, Markovic; Borini . Somehow Liverpool avoided a tonking, which justified the bizarre sight of Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Mario Balotelli, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson sitting on the bench at kick-off. After all there is still a trip to Ludogorets to go and that is a banker win, surely? Now for the aftermath. Hear that? It is the cranking up of pressure on a manager who has publicly demonstrated that Europe is not his holy grail despite spending all of last season aiming for it. A glance ahead at the fixture list gives away Rodgers’s thought processes, which centre round Chelsea and the weekend date at Anfield. There is a 12-point gap between the Premier League leaders and Liverpool in seventh place and Rodgers clearly wants to avoid it widening even further. Yet by turning his attention to domestic matters, he threatens to undermine all that went on last season. Karim Benzema (right) celebrates scoring what proved to be the winning goal for Real Madrid on Tuesday . Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle . Think back to a campaign in which Liverpool went on a 16-match unbeaten run, carried on a tide of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge goals and with the title a realistic objective. When the pressure got to the team and results went against them, the refrain from the Kop was ‘get us back into the Champions League’. To the neutral, Liverpool is unique with its pre-match unfurling of flags and stage-managed by emotional rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone. That atmosphere was shaped in Europe, back in the day when the Champions League was just for champions. Gary Lineker launched a spectacular Twitter attack on Rodgers for selecting a weakened line-up . Liverpool's captain for the night Martin Skrtel walks off at half-time holding his head with his side 1-0 down . The hashtag #YNWA is synonymous with the club, which is why Rodgers will not be publicly condemned by the Anfield faithful although there may be mutterings in private. If last season was the launch pad to the ‘project’, then this campaign was supposed to be about Gerrard strutting his stuff on the European stage while Liverpool stayed in contention for domestic honours too. Flawed genius Luis Suarez has gone, Sturridge is injury-prone and Mario Balotelli is, well, Mario Balotelli, so it does not take a genius to work out that Liverpool are not as good as they were last season. Brendan Rodgers applauds the travelling fans at full time after Liverpool's defeat by Real Madrid . VIDEO Rodgers 'not bothered' by selection criticism . But if they want to continue to be recognised as a big club, rather than a club with a big history, then a giant step forward must be taken. What happens if Rodgers’s rested players return only to lose to Chelsea? What happens if Ludogorets goes terribly wrong? Supporters will flip that question. Beating Jose Mourinho, reaching the knock-out stages of the Champions League and Rodgers will look like a genius. He reacted petulantly to Gary Lineker’s criticism on Tuesday night by questioning the BBC pundit’s managerial cv. At the same time, Rodgers cleverly plants a siege mentality into the minds of players and fans. Only time will tell, who is right.","Brendan Rodgers attracted criticism for fielding a weakened team in Liverpool's 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid on Tuesday night .

"Chelsea are on the brink of qualifying for the knockout rounds of the UEFA Youth League after a seven-goal rout of Maribor on Wednesday afternoon. Two goals apiece for Dominic Solanke and Charlie Colkett, plus further strikes from Charly Musonda, Alex Kiwomya and Tammy Abraham, made it four group stage wins out of four for the Blues. After a 4-1 win over Schalke in their opening game, a 5-0 thrashing of Sporting Lisbon on matchday two and a 2-0 success over the Slovenian side a fortnight ago, Adi Viveash's team knew another three points would pretty much wrap up qualification. Dominic Solanke celebrates scoring his second goal as Chelsea routed Maribor 7-0 in the UEFA Youth League . England youth international Solanke slots home his second of the game and Chelsea's fifth in Slovenia . Charlie Colkett celebrates his second goal with Jay DaSilva as the Blues ran riot .

Referee: Nikolai Yordanov (Bulgaria) Accordingly, they started brightly at the Sportni Park in Lendava, taking the lead after just six minutes when Solanke, who played for Jose Mourinho's senior side against Maribor at Stamford Bridge, capitalised on a sliced kick from goalkeeper Damjan Prineg to score from close range. Five minutes later and Chelsea doubled their lead thanks to Colkett's penalty after Ruben Loftus-Cheek was fouled in the box. Maribor, who have yet to win in the competition, were pinned back and Musonda made it three on 25 minutes with an accurate low shot from the edge of the area. The contest already settled, Chelsea continued to push forward at will with Prineg saving well from Solanke's chip after Colkett's ball over the home defence had set him clear. The reprieve was short-lived as Colkett scored his second of the afternoon with a moment of individual brilliance that saw him weave his way through the shell-shocked Maribor defence. It was five on the stroke of half-time when Loftus-Cheek scorched through the defence and crossed low for Solanke to score his second of the game and fourth of the competition. Chelsea's Charly Musonda fires home his team's third goal at the Sportni Park in Lendava . Solanke blasts home Chelsea's opening goal after seizing on a mistake by the Maribor goalkeeper . Charlie Colkett converts a penalty to double Chelsea's advantage after 11 minutes of the Youth League match . Viveash introduced Kiwomya and Abraham for Solanke and Izzy Brown at half-time and the traffic continued to flow in one direction. Colkett was denied his hat-trick when Prineg made a diving one-handed save after Musonda had played the Chelsea star through. Maribor's frustrations started to surface and defender Luka Uskokovic was shown a second yellow card with 20 minutes remaining. Maribor goalkeeper Damjan Prineg gathers the ball at the feet of Solanke as Chelsea press forward . Charlie Colkett scores his second of the match and Chelsea's fourth in Slovenia . There was no let-up from Chelsea and they struck a sixth when Kiwomya fired high into the net following aswift move involving Abraham and Musonda. And in stoppage time, Abraham swept home his third goal of the group phase after Colkett's free-kick was blocked.

"A woman arrested for allegedly using a realistic baby doll to gain access to a maternity ward claims she was only trying to see if the hospital would be interested in buying one. Merced, Calif., police tell Mail Online local woman Tonya Whitney was taken into custody after being seen with her husband in the Mercy Medical Center carrying the dolls on two separate occasions. According to the police report: 'Whitney explained her purpose was not to trespass or steal any of the infants, but to show her life-like babies to the nursing staff in the hopes they would purchase some for training.' Tonya Whitney was arrested for trespassing after police say she and her husband (unnamed) used realistic baby dolls to sneak into a hospital . The investigation remains underway and her husband is considered a witness by police, though he has not been charged. Whitney and her husband first appeared in the hospital emergency room carrying the dolls on Saturday. They appeared again on Monday and the woman was able to reach the maternity ward on the second floor by 'unknown means.' Police say Whitney infiltrated the place with a baby carrier holding a doll and a diaper bag. The Merced Sun-Star reported that a nurse called security on the couple, and both the woman and the man - who was waiting downstairs for her - were escorted out of the hospital. Whitney told officers she only wanted to try and sell the hospital her doll as a training tool . The unidentified pair left before police arrived. Whitney was reportedly wearing a nurse's uniform including the log-in sticker she obtained when she came to the hospital on Saturday. Mercy Medical Center spokesman Bob McLaughlin said that he's never heard of anyone trying to get into a maternity ward using fake babies before. 'We do not know why they were in the hospital,' he told The Merced Sun-Star. McLaughlin said the hospital's security worked as expected during the incident.","Police arrested Merced woman Tonya Whitney after she twice appeared in Mercy Medical Center carrying the dolls .

"Anderlecht manager Besnik Hasi believes Arsenal were worried about entertaining their fans rather than seeing the game out after throwing away a three-goal lead against the Belgian side. The Gunners left the Emirates with just a point when Anderlecht fought back from 3-0 down in the second-half to draw 3-3, a result which means Arsene Wenger's side are not yet guaranteed to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League.

'Maybe Arsenal thought they were on top and they could get more goals and they could have fun in front of the public. At 3-0, you can say it's over and they wanted the fourth and the fifth goal but we made some changes.'

At 3-2, you saw Arsenal were doubting. We also changed our scheme with the second striker. Yes, Arsenal doubted and we were growing. 'The last 30 minutes were as intense as when we won the championship [last season]. I am a young coach but this will stay in my memory.

"Critics of the HS2 rail project have put forward an alternative route using a train line which was closed in the 1960s. The rival scheme would see the reopening of the former Great Central line, which ran from London to Nottingham, with links to Leeds and Manchester. Supporters of the proposal claim it would cost around £6billion, instead of the £42.6 billion which the HS2 project is set to cost. Rival scheme: HS2 critics have put forward an alternative route using the former Great Central line, which ran from London to Nottingham and was closed in the 1960s . Kelvin Hopkins, the Labour MP for Luton North, has joined leading supermarket groups and hauliers to draw up plans to reopen the disused line. Mr Hopkins said reopening the Great Central railway would avoid many of the environmental concerns associated with HS2. ‘It could be built for £6billion, a fraction of what HS2 would cost, and it avoids all the environmental problems,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. ‘We have a very precise route, we have been working on it for a very long time and we are carefully trying to get political support. ‘Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer are desperate to get more of their goods on rail and they have written letters backing this scheme. Axed: The southern section of the Great Central Railway was closed in 1966 by Dr Richard Beeching . ‘HS2 is clearly a white elephant, but the problem is that when governments announce something they find it difficult to back down.’ Axed by Dr Richard Beeching, the southern section of the Great Central Railway has been closed since 1966. Its express trains ran from London to Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds, with a branch to Manchester. Supporters of the plan say that since much of the infrastructure still exists, the disruption to local residents caused by rebuilding the line would be substantially less than a new railway. ‘So much of the railway still exists, and it would be billions of pounds cheaper to build than HS2,’ said Brian Holyland, a member of the Great Central Railway Society who worked on the line before it was closed.","Rival scheme would see reopening of former Great Central line .

"David Silvester has blamed the recent storms on the decision to legalise gay marriage . Nigel Farage hit back at attacks on Ukip, after he suspended a councillor who blamed the Christmas and New Year floods on David Cameron’s decision to legalise gay marriage. David Silvester claimed last week that the country had been ‘beset by storms’ because the Prime Minister had acted ‘arrogantly against the Gospel’ by passing same-sex marriage laws. Ukip’s leadership had originally refused to discipline Mr Silvester, 73, a town councillor in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, saying that everyone was entitled to their religious views. But he was finally suspended yesterday afternoon after defying a request not to do further interviews on his beliefs. However, Mr Farage today suggested that the remarks had only become a story after Mr Silvester joined Ukip from the Tory party, where he had previously aired similar views. Speaking in a question-and-answer session in the City, the Ukip leader said: 'I think it is very interesting that, when Mr Silvester was saying these things in 2012 and 2013 as a Conservative town councillor in Henley, it was not a news story. But suddenly he switches to Ukip and continues the same thing and gets on the national news. 'I think that shows you and tells you all you need to know. The establishment, the status quo, the big businesses, the big Eurocrats and our three so-called main political parties are scared witless by what Ukip is doing because we are striking a chord not just for ordinary people but for many elements in the business community as well. 'They will try to do whatever they can to shoot us down.' Mr Silvester angered party bosses by going on local radio to say that being gay was a ‘spiritual disease’ which can be healed. The move came as Mr Farage launched a clearout of ‘extremist, nasty or barmy’ views from the party ahead of polls in May. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said Mr Silvester's comments had only become a story since he defected from the Tory party . It emerged at the weekend that five of the party’s current MEPs have been told they will not be able to stand again. Michael Fallon, the Conservative Business Minister, said the Silvester affair showed that ‘there clearly are one or two fruitcakes still around there’. He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics Show: ‘[The Tories are] the only party that can actually secure reform and give people the choice they’ve been arguing for a long time. Whatever happens in the European elections, it is simply a protest vote.’ 'Went against requests': Nigel Farage tweeted about Mr Silvester's suspension . Mr Silvester wrote another letter to the Henley Standard in April 2012 in which he told David Cameron not to legalise gay marriage and warned of 'disasters' if he did . The comments echo Mr Cameron’s attack on . Ukip members as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’ – a comment . from which he backtracked. Mr Silvester made his original comments in a . letter to a local newspaper. Pestilence: Part of the letter in the Henley Standard, claiming recent floods were godly vengeance . He was suspended after going on BBC Radio Berkshire to say that the new legislation, paving the way for the first gay marriages in the spring, was the latest mistake which would anger God. Mr Silvester said he had learnt at bible college that there was no proof that the ‘gay condition’ comes from the genes, and that through the Holy Spirit, a gay person can be healed. ‘There is healing for the gay condition and I believe a Christian should long for gay people to be healed and to have normal heterosexual lives,’ he said. ‘It is nonsense to say it is homophobic. It is a spiritual disease... it’s not what I say, it’s what the Bible says.’ Twitter users reacted angrily to his comments, branding him a 'blithering idiot' and questioning his position as councillor. Sam Bergmanski, a graduate from Cardiff, said: 'What is a man like David Silvester doing in public office? Disgrace.' Another . user calling himself Sisco, from Cumbria, added: 'UKIP Councillor David . Silvester says the floods are due to gay marriage. Why do people take . UKIP seriously? seriously, how?' Henley's Tory MP John Howell, added: 'I . thought Mr Silvester's letter was not the sort of thing that he should . have written in today's age. He really needs to consider his position.' Ukip is riding high in the polls and is expected to do well in May’s European elections. Yesterday one survey suggested voters regard Mr Farage’s party more ‘favourably’ than any of the three main parties. Another poll found that Mr Farage is the second most popular party leader, behind Mr Cameron. Since Christmas Eve several storms have left tens of thousands without power across the UK, caused damage to homes and businesses and disrupted transport .","David Silvester, 73, wrote a letter to the Henley Standard in Oxfordshire .

They show emaciated . corpses with strangulation marks, cuts, bruising and signs of . electrocution – evidence of extreme torture, claim investigators. Some . victims had no eyes. Scroll down for video . Shocking: This picture is one of 55,000 taken by a Syrian military police defector showing emaciated corpses which investigators say are evidence of extreme torture by Assad's regime. Photographs: The Report . Leverage: A report into alleged human rights abuses in Syria was made available to the United Nations, governments and human rights groups just as peace talks are due to begin in Switzerland to try to end the three-year conflict . And today Foreign Secretary William . Hague, as well as the U.S. government, condemned the crimes shown in the . photographs, and demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice. Mr . Hague described the images as 'compelling and horrific', and said: 'it . is important those who have perpetrated these crimes are one day held to . account.' A spokesman from . the U.S. State Department said: 'These reports suggest widespread and . apparently systematic violations by the regime. These most recent images . ... are extremely disturbing. They're horrible to look at.' Sir . Desmond de Silva, one of the lawyers who compiled a report on the . credibility of the images, said that the evidence 'documented . industrial-scale killing.' He pointed out that because the images . purport to come from just one part of Syria, the human rights abuses . could be much more widespread. ‘This is a smoking gun of a kind we didn’t have before. It makes a very strong case indeed,’ he said.‘It is the tip of the iceberg because this is 11,000 in just one area.' Assad . denies the claims, insisting he is fighting terrorists, while a Syrian . government spokesman questioned whether the images were even taken in . Syria. The 31-page report - released by The Guardian and CNN - was commissioned by Carter-Ruck solicitors in London on behalf of the Qatari government, which supports the Syrian uprising. The dossier is being made available to the United Nations, governments and human rights groups just as peace talks are due to begin in Switzerland tomorrow to try to end the three-year conflict. Evidence supplied by the defector records deaths of those in custody from March 2011 until August 2013. The photos were smuggled out along with files detailing the victims on memory sticks. The images have drawn condemnation from international aid groups as well. Graphic: The defector's evidence, which records deaths of those in custody from March 2011 until August 2013, were smuggled out along with files detailing the victims on memory sticks . Dossier of evidence: The photos will ratchet up the pressure on President Bashar Al Assad who the US and its Western allies - including the UK - say has committed war crimes against his own people . Allegations: The photographs allowed a death certificate to be produced without requiring families to view bodies, and also confirmed that execution orders had been carried out, the report claimed . Philip Luther, the director of Amnesty International in the Middle East, said: 'World leaders must demand that the Commission of Inquiry and other human rights bodies be granted immediate access to all places of detention – formal and informal – in Syria. 'The allegations are consistent with aspects of Amnesty International’s own research into torture and enforced disappearance by the Syrian government and must be taken seriously. 'If confirmed, these would be crimes against humanity committed on a staggering scale. It certainly raises the question once again why the Security Council has not yet referred the situation in Syria to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.' 'The report raises serious concerns over the safety of the thousands of individuals, including peaceful activists, currently held in state-run detention centres and those subjected to enforced disappearance.' Today's report was compiled by three lawyers, all former prosecutors at the criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, examined the evidence and said they found the defector, who goes by the name of Caesar, credible. According to the report, he said his job was to take pictures of killed detainees, though he did not claim to have witnessed executions or torture. ‘There could be as many as 50 bodies a . day to photograph which require 15 to 30 minutes of work per corpse,’ he . told an inquiry team. The photographs allowed a death . certificate to be produced without requiring families to view bodies, . and also confirmed that execution orders had been carried out, he . claimed. Families of the dead were told cause of death was either a heart attack or breathing problems. The inquiry team said it was satisfied . there was ‘clear evidence, capable of being believed by a tribunal of . fact in a court of law, of systematic torture and killing of detained . persons by the agents of the Syrian government’. Horrific: The inquiry team said it was satisfied there was 'clear evidence, capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law, of systematic torture and killing of persons detained by the Syrian government' Documenting death: Caesar said his job was to take pictures of killed detainees, but did not claim to have witnessed executions or torture . The evidence would ‘support findings of crimes against humanity and could also support findings of war crimes’. Caesar's . path to defection began in September 2011, around seven months after . the conflict broke out, when he was contacted by a relative who had fled . the country. The man - known as 'Caesar's contact' - was working for 'international human rights groups', according to the report. Caesar . began sending him thousands of images, but soon became concerned for . his safety, so the Syrian opposition arranged for him and his family to . be smuggled out of the country. Their location has not been revealed, with the lawyers only saying they conducted their investigation in the Middle East. It is also not clear how the Qatari regime came to be involved in the publication of the report. Qatar has carved an influential role in Syria by being quick to help the rebels and, later, by helping set up the Coalition a year ago with the aim of creating a credible alternative to Assad. Defector: Caesar began sending him thousands of images, but soon became concerned for his safety, so the Syrian opposition arranged for him and his family to be smuggled out of the country . Evidence of strangulation: A picture which appears to show a ligature mark on a corpse's neck . Qatar and Saudi Arabia are close allies in many respects. As Sunni Muslims, they share an interest in thwarting Shi'ite, non-Arab Iran and its Arab allies - Shi'ites in Iraq and Lebanon and Assad's Syrian Alawites. Last year, however, Qatar found itself . under pressure from Saudi Arabia and from the United States over the . way the war was going, and notably over the rising influence on the . frontlines of Islamists hostile to the West and to its allies in the . Middle East - like the Saudi royal house. An . expansion of the Coalition to 120 seats diluted Qatari control and . handed leadership to the Saudi-backed Jarba. On the ground, however, . Qatar is still a force, through groups like al-Tawhid, part of a new . Islamic Front that controls large areas and coordinates with the al . Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. A . Gulf source with knowledge of Qatari policy said the new emir, in power . since June, wanted a lower profile than his father who had strongly . backed the Arab revolts. The . new emir was also more open to Western requests to stop supporting . militants, though Qatar still believed that arming rebels was needed to . force Assad to compromise, however, the source said. The report's authors are Sir Desmond de . Silva, former chief prosecutor of the special court for Sierra Leone, . Sir Geoffrey Nice, the former lead prosecutor of former Yugoslavian . president Slobodan Milosevic, and Professor David Crane, who indicted . President Charles Taylor of Liberia at the Sierra Leone court. Tension: An inquiry team said the images were 'clear evidence... of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the Syrian government'. President Assad, pictured, denies the claims . The Syrian regime has also funded and . co-operated with al-Qaeda in a complex double game - even as the . terrorists fight Damascus, it was claimed last night. Western . intelligence agencies, anti-rebels and al-Qaeda defectors claim two . al-Qaeda affiliates operating in Syria have both been financed by . selling oil and gas to and through the regime from wells under their . control. Rebels and . defectors said the regime also deliberately released militant prisoners . to strengthen jihadist ranks at the expense of moderate rebel forces. The . aim was to persuade the West that the uprising was sponsored by . Islamist militants including al-Qaeda as a way of stopping Western . support for it, the intelligence report claims. Doubt remains over whether Assad will attend tomorrow's Geneva II conference in the Swiss resort of Montreux which is aimed at negotiating his exit from power. But in an interview released yesterday, Assad said there was a 'significant' chance he will seek a new term. He also ruled out any power-sharing deal with the opposition which he dismissed as having been 'created' by foreign backers. And he called for the peace talks to focus on what he termed his 'war against terrorism'. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign minister says that the U.N. decision to rescind the invitation to Iran to join the peace talks was a mistake but not a catastrophe. Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's decision to withdraw his last-minute offer to Iran to attend the conference would have a negative impact on the United Nations image. The Assad regime last night sought to distance itself from the photographs, and questioned their authenticity. Bassam Abu Abdullah, from the Syrian Ministry of Information, said there was no evidence they were taken in Syria. He told the BBC: ‘I doubt this report. We should check these photos. Who are these people? Where are the names? From which prisons? Who is this person who has the authority to have these photos?’ He added that he was ‘astonished’ at the figure of 11,000 victims, saying it had not been raised before.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The former IMF chief accused of sexually assaulting a chambermaid was bundled through a side door as he arrived to speak to the Cambridge University Union last night. Dominique Strauss-Kahn was met by a crowd of as many as 200 student protesters objecting to his speech at the world-famous debating society. Security was tight at the sold-out event and spectators were not admitted unless they surrendered their phones and agreed to be searched. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Anger: Protesters and security staff clash during a demonstration yesterday against Dominique Strauss-Kahn's attendance at Cambridge University Union where he gave a speech . Tight security: The former IMF chief was greeted by a crowd of about 200 student protesters objecting to his speech at the world-famous debating society. In this image a man is held by police during the demonstration . Fury: Security was tight at the sold-out event and spectators were not admitted unless they surrendered their phones and agreed to be searched . The French economist was rushed into a side entrance of the hall by . security guards, who scuffled with photographers and a demonstrator, . about an hour before he spoke. He said nothing to waiting journalists - who were barred from listening to the speech - and would not answer their questions. A ring of steel was set up around the building with security staff . guarding entrances and fences erected to keep demonstrators at bay. Protesters fought with police outside the hall where Strauss-Kahn was addressing one . of the UK's most famous university debating societies. Demonstrators tried to scale fences at the back of the building to interrupt the event and two were carried away by police. A police spokeswoman said a 19-year-old man had been arrested on . suspicion of assaulting police and a 23-year-old woman arrested on . suspicion of breaching the peace. Security: Dominique Strauss-Kahn talking at the controversial Cambridge Union Society event. He is flanked by bodyguards supplied by the Union . Tense: A woman is pressed between fencing as she is led away outside the Cambridge University Union . Unrest: Demonstrators tried to scale fences at the back of the Union building in an attempt to interrupt the event . She said two people arrested earlier in the day on suspicion of causing . criminal damage, after graffiti appeared on the union building, also . remained in custody. Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, was accused of . sexually assaulting New York hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo, but U.S. prosecutors dropped criminal charges against him in August. Criminal . charges against Mr Strauss-Kahn were dropped by Diallo, who has since . launched a bid to win monetary damages in New York's civil court. On . March 28, the same day as the first hearing in the civil case, Mr . Strauss-Kahn is expected to be charged in France over a prostitution . ring, including charges of complicity in pimping. He has also been accused by 32-year-old French writer Tristane Banon of attempting to rape her in 2003. Ring of steel: A security guard, left, prevents students from climbing a fence into the compound of the Union Society . Time to go: A woman is carried away by police during the demonstration . Difficult night: An injured demonstrator is helped by a police officer at the protest . Student Niki Horsfall, 23, said Mr Strauss-Kahn had been asked once about the incident with the maid and once about protesters. 'He was very professional. He said he had spent a week in prison ... and was acquitted,' said Ms Horsfall. 'He was asked about the protesters and said they could do what they want.' She added: 'Apart from that it was all economics.' Meanwhile, women's rights campaigners believe the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief should have been banned from speaking at the Union. One message scrawled in huge black letters on a wall read ‘Jog On DSK’ while another message scribbled in red states ‘DSK Die’. Another message calls to ‘End Rape Culture’ while a separate slogan says ‘Women Deserve Better’. A large banner was hung across the oak doors of the 146-year-old building reading: ‘Only 6% of reported rape ends in conviction: DSK adding to the 94%’. One student protester said: ‘After we . discovered he was still coming and that we were not even allowed to . attend the talk, we wanted to exercise our own freedom of speech as . individuals and let the Union know what we think.’ Protesters outside the Cambridge Union Society as Dominique Strauss-Khan, who was accused of sexual assault in the U.S., delivered a talk to students . Campaigners claim the invite to Strauss-Khan displays a 'callous desire' by the student body to 'exploit gender crime allegations in the service of controversy' Rushed in: Security guards shields the former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn as he is rushed in to Cambridge University Union . Another student said the timing of . the address makes it even worse: ‘It is particularly inappropriate that . this talk should be scheduled for a day after International Woman's Day. ‘The Union should be using its position of influence to fight sexism and sexual violence.’ The . Cambridge Union Society defended its decision to invite Mr . Strauss-Kahn, saying the invitation was not made after or as a result of . the circumstances surrounding his departure from the IMF. ‘The . Society has been inviting him to address our members for several years, . given his economic knowledge as then head of the IMF, and his . experience of French politics. ‘We would like to add that the purpose of the Union is to provide a neutral platform for free speech,’ it added. Controversial: Former IMF chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, arrives at Cambridge University Union in a chauffeur-driven car . The society insisted that its invitation did not imply ‘support or endorsement’ for Mr Strauss-Kahn, it said speakers were selected ‘regardless of their ideology, background or personal history’. ‘We feel Mr Strauss-Kahn is . exceptionally well qualified to speak on some of the most prominent . international headlines of 2012, namely the global financial crisis and . the French Presidential election, and so we believe he will give a . pertinent and interesting speech,’ it added. Campaigners gathered outside the . Union in protest against Mr Strauss-Kahn’s appearance, which . they claimed displayed a ‘callous desire’ by the student body to ‘exploit . gender crime allegations in the service of controversy’. But the world-famous debating society controversially decided to go ahead with the sold-out event. Douglas . Wigdor, the lawyer representing the hotel maid allegedly sexually . assaulted by former IMF chief Dominique Strauss Kahn, joined protestors after earlier giving a talk in the law faculty. The . Oxford graduate and partner at New York firm Thompson Wigdor LLP, said: . ‘It is my view that Strauss-Kahn is using the Cambridge Union's stature . as an attempt to rebuild his own reputation and without participating . in a free and open debate about the many issues of which he is directly . involved concerning the rights of women and the abuse of his power. Angry students protest outside the Cambridge Union Society as disgraced politician Dominique Strauss-Khan arrives to give a talk . ‘As he will not be discussing these important subjects, I felt compelled to do so.’ The . announcement that Mr Strauss-Kahn would address the society sparked a . furore last month and led hundreds of students to sign a petition in . protest. In its open letter calling for his . invitation to be withdrawn, the Cambridge University Student Union . Women's Campaign wrote: ‘Numerous charges of attempted rape and sexual . assault should give the Union Society pause for thought when . administering their speaker invitations. ‘Yet . conversely, the Union Society appears to have invited DSK because of . the combination of his former economic position and alleged criminal . notoriety. ‘Does the Union Society see allegations of attempted rape and sexual assault as titillation for its membership?’ The Cambridge’s Women’s Campaign said the . Union event gave Strauss-Kahn a platform to speak without having to . answer the sexual allegations against him. Fury: Banners have appeared on the Union building protesting against a visit by Dominique Strauss-Kahn . Clear message: Graffiti has appeared on buildings around Cambridge in protest against the former IMF chief's invitation to speak . Writing on the wall: Graffiti that has appeared on a building in Cambridge ahead of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrival . Speaking out: Douglas Wigdor speaks to members of the Cambridge University Students Union in opposition to Strauss-Kahn appearing . CUSU Women’s Officer Ruth Graham said: 'The Union didn’t want to listen to our petition, which I find hard to understand. 'We started the petition as so many women students had got in touch saying they were angry and upset about his visit. 'Many felt strongly that they didn’t want to legitimise his presence in Cambridge. 'The Union asked him to speak about the economy and on his terms so it ignores what else has happened. 'By protesting we show that the women who come forward and report rape and sexual assault are listened to.' But society leaders defended their decision to invite Mr Strauss-Kahn - and to ban journalists from the talk. President Katie Lam, 20, who is studying classics at Cambridge, said the union was not deliberately courting controversy. She . said officials invited speakers they thought 'interesting' and did not . make 'moral or political judgments', adding that the union's invitation . was first made 'a few years ago'. Officials had decided on a 'no-press policy' after discussions with Mr Strauss-Kahn, she added.","Angry scenes as more than 200 student protesters demonstrate against Dominique Strauss-Kahn's speech at Cambridge University Union .

"America's NFL have put in place plans to embrace Remembrance Sunday with a lot more detail than previously shown by British sports in honouring the war dead. Jacksonville and Dallas meet at Wembley on November 9 in the third regular-season NFL game there this autumn. And, in a partnership with the Royal British Legion, the uniforms and helmets of both teams will feature the poppy logo, which will also be displayed to big effect on the pitch. Jacksonville's Blake Roberts (left) and Dalla's DeMarco Murray will be wearing Remembrance Sunday-themed uniforms when the Jaguars and Cowboys meet in their regular season clash at Wembley on November 9 . An initiative in partnership with the Royal British Legion will see the poppy featured prominantly at Wembley . At the end of the match, 80,000 poppies will be dropped from the roof into the stands and all the kit and equipment will be auctioned, with the proceeds going to the Poppy Appeal that supports the Legion’s work with the Armed Forces. Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK, said: ‘The NFL has a tremendous respect and admiration for the service given by the military, both in the US and UK.’ Premier League clubs now all wear poppies on their shirts in fixtures around Remembrance Sunday but only after a Sportsmail campaign. England’s football team weren’t going to have poppies on their kit when they played Spain on November 12, 2011, owing to a FIFA edict but again Sportsmail pressure resulted in FIFA allowing poppies adorning black armbands. Soldiers parade around Norwich City's Carrow Road ground at half-time on Remembrance Sunday . Roy Keane’s second autobiography, to be released on October 9, is likely to create even more publicity than Kevin Pietersen’s book, which comes out on the same day. The 43-year-old has not given his employers at Aston Villa or the FA of Ireland an advance view of the contents of The Second Half, written with award-winning author Roddy Doyle. Roy Keane's second autobiography, written by Roddy Doyle, come out the same day as Kevin Pietersen's . Keane will have the platform of being on international duty with the Republic of Ireland before the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany. Manager Martin O’Neill said: ‘We will just have to deal with it.’ Keane will surely have his say about former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who described him as an ‘intimidating ferocious individual’ in his recent memoirs. A sure sign of cycling’s boom is the arrival on the scene of football agents. Leading middleman Mark Curtis is the first to recognise the opportunities and now represents newcomer Leopold Konig, who turned to Curtis to secure a dream move to Sky. It was Curtis who negotiated Konig’s two-year, seven-figure contract with Sky cycling chief Sir Dave Brailsford. The Czech is expected to be Chris Froome’s chief support rider next year. Czech rider Leopold Konig enlisted the expertise of Mark Curtis to secure his dream move to Team Sky . Fulham owner Shahid Khan’s five-strong search committee to identify the next manager at Craven Cottage surprisingly includes fan David Daly, a senior director at Nike, when Fulham are in year two of a four-season kit contract with arch-rivals adidas. Previous boss Felix Magath was recommended by Craven Cottage CEO Alistair Mackintosh but chosen by Khan. Bjorn in Ryder frame . European Tour board members expect Padraig Harrington and Thomas Bjorn to be sounded out about the Ryder Cup captaincy in 2016 as well as favourites Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez. If Bjorn wants to be considered, it will complicate the selection process. The Dane, as chairman of the European tournament committee, was expected to be the fifth man on the nominations panel who would likely give a possible casting vote to Clarke. Meanwhile, Clarke’s bid for the captaincy will not be helped by the upset caused when he withdrew from the 2014 race and publicly backed Colin Montgomerie rather than Paul McGinley. It could cause complications if Thomas Bjorn (pictured left drenching Spain's Sergio Garcia, right, as they celebrate winning the Ryder Cup) becomes a contender for the post of Europe captain for 2016 . Former Chelsea and Southampton star Ken Monkou, player of the year at Stamford Bridge in 1990, has been declared bankrupt following a number of failed business ventures. These included a proposed upmarket quarterly magazine Football Life that has gone into liquidation owing £216,000 to 44 creditors. Wacky Leeds chairman Massimo Cellino’s view of win bonuses is that players should return them if they lose. So instead of a cash incentive, the Leeds team receive two extra shirts for a victory - much to the concern of the kitman.

"Stan Collymore, who attracts more controversy away from football than any other mainstream pundit, appears at Warrington magistrates court on Thursday morning charged with four driving offences. Collymore, talkSPORT’s lead football expert, drove his Porsche at around 10mph in excess of the various speed limits. He already has three points on his driving license according to court documents and risks a long driving ban. Scroll down for video . Stan Collymore will appear at Warrington magistrates court on Thursday charged with four driving offences . However, Collymore, who recently incited a protest from South Atlantic war veterans by making a crass tweet about the Falklands, is being represented by celebrity solicitor Mark Haslam, who specialises in road traffic cases and has a number of footballers as clients. It is expected Collymore will follow the example of Freddie Flintoff, who escaped a driving ban last August by claiming it would seriously hamper his charity work. The footballer-turned-pundit already has three points on his driving license and risks a long ban . The latest of almost daily revelations emanating from Leeds United is that former club owners GFH Capital claim to have sworn witness statements by bank compliance officers that the former Leeds managing director David Haigh deposited around 100 false invoices for over £4m into four accounts held in London, Dubai and Manchester. A spokesman for Haigh, who has spent 136 days in prison in Dubai, said: ‘David continues to maintain his complete innocence.’ Former Kent captain David Fulton summed up the game’s low opinion of the ECB’s decision to charge Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale with racist abuse. In his speech at the Cricket Writers’ Awards, Fulton (right) parodied what Gale said to Ashwell Prince, saying: ‘If there are any Australians in the room, can you f*** off back to your own country.’ Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale was charged with racist abuse towards Ashwell Prince by the ECB . lt is hard to fathom why the RFU have given England manager Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff extended six-year contracts until after the 2019 World Cup when everything depends on how they do in the tournament on home soil in 2015. Fears that they may be poached or a desire at Twickenham for long-term continuity will be irrelevant if England fail to get out of their difficult World Cup group. And the RFU will not reveal whether the contracts have get-out clauses. Chief executive Ian Ritchie, who made the contract recommendations that the board approved, said: ‘We are not going into the details. There is ongoing assessment about the team’s performance, but we have absolute faith in Stuart and his team.’ England head coach Stuart Lancaster has signed as new contract until after the 2019 World Cup . Royal St George’s Golf Club look certain to follow the example of the R&A, who have voted to admit female members for the first time. The Sandwich-based club, who hosted the Open in 2011, when former Minister for Sport Hugh Robertson led the chorus of disapproval of their male-only membership, have already canvassed members’ views ahead of an official ballot at the start of next year. It is understood the vast majority agreed when consulted that women should finally be allowed in after 127 years. Club secretary Tim Checketts said: ‘I imagine that to be the case, but we need to hold a proper ballot and consider all the ramifications.’ Darren Clarke won the 2011 Open held at the Royal St George’s Golf Club held in Sandwich, Kent . The opinions of Rio Ferdinand have been given extra credence since the FA revealed they may put him forward next year as the English candidate for the vacant British vice-presidency on the FIFA executive. And Ferdinand neatly summed up the main obstacle to English success at international level in the Facebook-launched excerpt from his new book #2sides. Rio writes: ‘The Premier League is completely detached from the ideas and vision of the FA and vice versa. The barrier has to be broken down. The big clubs have very little interest in the national team. All they care about is what benefits them and they think mainly in terms of money.

"Postboxes are so often spotted in our cities and towns that we rarely hail them as feats of craftmanship. But these pictures show the skilled work which goes into creating a British icon. The classic pillar box has rarely changed in the 160 years since they were introduced as a modern experiment in the channel islands in 1852. In fact, the most recent alteration to the roadside pillar box has not been in its design, but in its status - post boxes are now private property after last month's sell off of the Royal Mail. The men and women responsible for . shaping the country's most familiar roadside fixture work for Machan . Engineering in Denny, Scotland. Pride of place: A new pillar box stands proudly on a British street. This year the iconic boxes are 160 years old after being inspired by French and Belgian versions . Famous cast: Pillar post boxes wait to be assembled in the dressing shop of Machan Engineering in Denny, Scotland . Flat pack: As well as making the famous pillar box, Machan also produce wall boxes and lamp boxes, which can be seen laid and ready for assembly, above . Heavy duty: The pillar boxes were designed to be sturdy to prevent them being taken or tampered with. Their narrow slits are also designed to keep out rain . Hands on: Although they are cast to shape, the boxes still need to be 'dressed' by skilled staff at the workshop, here, Dougie Morrison, gets to grips with the base of a box . Machan manufactures all the post boxes for the Royal Mail in the UK, and has done for over twenty years. They shape the cast iron structures to order, making both the classic pillar box and also wall boxes which are placed into the side of buildings. The famous receptacles are moulded before being shaped and welded together in the company's workshop just outside Falkirk. They are then given the famous lick of red paint which makes them the most famous of British street furniture. Special delivery: Lamp boxes, like the ones being made by Scott  Morrison, above, have to be made specially so they can be attached to fixtures like lamp posts . Seal of approval: The post boxes of Royal Mail bear the mark of the monarch reigning at the time of manufacture. Here, Elizabeth Regina II refers to the Queen . Production line: Machan Engineering have been the sole maker of the Royal Mail post boxes for more than 20 years, they also refurbish old red telephone boxes for BT . Classic: A painter applies the famous red paint to a pillar box. Post boxes were first green, but people complained that they blended in with the countryside . Try again: The Post Office then decided to try painting their boxes a shade of chocolate brown but the added varnish meant the maintenance of boxes was too expensive . The post boxes came into the hands of shareholders earlier this month when Royal Mail was privatized. Initial share prices of 330p rocketed . after the sell off, their current worth is 540p. That steep rise led to . criticism of the government for selling the historic mail service too . cheaply. Post boxes were . first places on our streets after the famous novelist Anthony Trollope, . who once worked as a Surveyor's Clerk at the Post Office, suggested to . his bosses that Britain needed fixtures similar to those he had seen on . French and Belgian streets. In . 1952, the state owned service agreed to trail three cast-iron pillar . boxes on Jersey. Later that year a further four were introduced on . Guernsey. Scarlet solution: In 1874, it was finally agreed that all post boxes in Britain should be painted red. It would be another 10 years before the repainting project was finished . Work in progress: The boxes are stood on batons to keep them from sticking to the factory floor as painters work their way through a batch . Old hand: Experienced craftsman Pail Ainslie paints the last few spots of a post box by hand at the factory, which is just outside Falkirk . Work in progress: The first undercoat applied to the boxes makes them look a shade of pink. Hard wearing red paint is added later to minimise the need for touching up . Drying time: The iron shapes are stood up to dry in great lines of red at the factory. They will eventually be shipped off to destinations all over the country . The first trial was considered a . success and boxes began appearing on the British mainland from 1853, but . it was not for another five years that a standard design began to . emerge with local authorities agreeing on the most practical shape for . ease of use and keeping out rain. Post boxes got their famous colour after a certain amount of trial and error. The . earliest boxes were green so as not to be an eyesore in the landscape, . but they were so effective that the Post Office was flooded with . complaints from people who could not find their local drop off point. Inside job: All parts of the pillar boxes have to be treated, as above, to prevent letters which have been posted being effected by oxidisation . Hung up: Lamp letter boxes like the ones seen above are common in country villages were they are suspended from utility poles or lamp posts . The next incarnation of the boxes were . chocolate brown, but these were more expensive to upkeep so, . eventually, in 1874, it was agreed that the standard colour of the . postbox should be red. There . are few exceptions to the famous colouring. Most recently in 2012, it . was agreed that the local postboxes of victorious British athletes at .

"Mario Gotze has lifted the lid behind his photo with Lionel Messi after the World Cup final. Gotze uploaded an Instagram picture with the 27-year-old superstar following Germany's 1-0 summer showpiece win against Argentina.

Accompanied with the caption 'Genius @leomessi', the picture shows the 22-year-old with his man-of-the match medal around his neck next to a pensive-looking Messi. The timing of the photo may be in question following the emotional state of the two players at the time, but Gotze insists it was all in good spirits. In a television interview with German show Audi Star Talk, the Bayern Munich midfielder was asked whether or not it was Messi who asked to have his photo taken with the World Champion but reveals it was the other way around. 'If I am honest, I was in a conference room and I had won the medal for man-of-the-match,' Gotze said. Gotze (front) scored the only goal of the game as Germany beat Argentina 1-0 after extra time in Brazil . 'I saw him from behind and went running after him to get a picture, so it was actually the other way around.

"A British jihadi who has threatened to ‘bomb the UK’ is today unmasked as a former supermarket security guard – who travelled to wage war in Syria despite being known to police. Less than two weeks ago, the anonymous extremist known only as ‘Awlaki’ gave an extraordinary interview to the BBC where he boasted about fighting with the terror group Islamic State (IS) and laughed about the beheading of soldiers. But today The Mail on Sunday can reveal that this fanatical Muslim who claims to ‘hate the UK’ is 27-year-old Omar Hussain, who grew up in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Scroll down for video . Execution witness: Omar Hussain has told friends in the UK that he watched the beheading of James Foley . Astonishingly, he is still in contact with friends in this country and has told them he witnessed the execution of American journalist James Foley. According to community leaders in High Wycombe, police knew of his extremist views and had arrested him at Heathrow last year on suspicion that he was trying to travel to Syria. Despite this, he managed to leave Britain for the war-torn Middle East earlier this year. Lord Carlile, the Government’s former adviser on counter-terrorism, last night called for an investigation into how Hussain managed to leave the country. ‘It would be extremely troubling if it emerged that he was allowed to leave the country without a travel document. I would like to know what steps were taken given the knowledge of his intentions,’ he said. Security job: After leaving school, Hussain worked for this Morrisons in High Wycombe as a security guard . The revelations come after Prime Minister David Cameron claimed the prospect of fighters from IS returning to Britain now poses the ‘greatest and deepest’ security threat in the country’s history. On Friday, the UK terror threat level was raised from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’, meaning the risk of an attack is ‘highly likely’. In his BBC2 Newsnight interview this month in which he disguised his true identity, Hussain said: ‘I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.’ When asked if IS beheaded a number of people after taking towns around Aleppo a fortnight ago, he laughed and said: ‘Yeah, we did. I believe there were three or four guys we beheaded. ‘We then put their heads, as usual, in the middle of the town centre.’ Execution: Less than two weeks ago, Hussain gave an interview to the BBC where he boasted about fighting with ISIS and laughed about the beheading of soldiers. Above, Mr Foley is seen moments before his execution . Former classmates from Cressex comprehensive school in High Wycombe yesterday recalled Hussain as a ‘weird, social outcast’. ‘He would tell girls to dress conservatively and put their hair up, otherwise they would be punished by God,’ said one former pupil. After leaving school, he worked for Morrisons for a number of years as a security guard. Last night, staff at the High Wycombe store recognised his photo. He had worked there three years ago, one colleague said, but left after vandalising a manager’s car. Hussain travelled to Syria in January after telling his family he was going to Friday prayers at his local mosque. Lord Carlile, the Government’s ex-adviser on counter-terrorism, has called for an investigation into how Hussain managed to leave the country . It is thought he went first to France, then overland to Turkey and over the border to Syria. Hussain has since been actively involved in fighting around Aleppo in northern Syria. The Mail on Sunday has learned that he contacted a friend in High Wycombe in the days after Mr Foley’s execution, saying he witnessed it. According to an informed source, Thames Valley Police are aware of his claims and know the identity of the individual he contacted. Police refused to answer any questions relating to Hussain, saying they cannot comment on individual cases. Hussain, who is British-born and of Pakistani heritage, is the youngest of three sons and lived at a semi-detached house in High Wycombe with his mother and brothers. Community elders said he became radicalised two years ago after he started mixing with a group of hardline Muslims known as salafis at his mosque in the Totteridge area of High Wycombe run by the Wycombe Islamic Society (WISE). Zahid Jawed, a spokesman for WISE, said Hussain did worship at the mosque but denied it had radicalised him. One of Hussain’s neighbours, who asked not to be named, said that in June last year, he was detained at the airport as he tried to leave for Pakistan as police had suspicions that he might travel on to Syria. As Hussain was questioned at Heathrow the police came and raided his house, the neighbour added. Hussain was also re-arrested a few weeks later outside his house, but released the next day without charge. Mohammed Khaliel, a family friend and Muslim leader, said: ‘His mother is extremely distressed. She is crying a lot. They are a good family.’","Omar Hussain travelled to wage war in Syria despite being known to police .

"Jordan Green, pictured with his hairdresser mother Heidi, from . Harrogate, who found him hanged at home. A 12-year-old schoolboy has hanged himself at home. Art-loving Jordan Green was found by his mum Heidi in an upstairs room. Yesterday tributes were paid by classmates of Jordan. They left flowers and a lit candle in a lantern outside his stone-built mid-terrace home in Duncan Street, Harrogate, North Yorks. Mobile hairdresser Heidi, 36, discovered Jordan's body at 9.20am Wednesday. Paramedics and police were called but Jordan was pronounced dead at the scene. The Harrogate High School pupil was checked on by mum after he'd failed to leave for classes. Her next door neighbour said: 'My partner was in the bath upstairs and heard Heidi let out a terrible scream. 'Then there was lots of noise and then the ambulance and police turned up.' Jordan, who also loved horses, was an only child and his father lives elsewhere in Harrogate. 'Jordan was a sweet lad and it is awful to think of him hanging himself. I know he had some problems.'

Andrew Bayston, head teacher at Harrogate High School, said a special tribute room had been set up at the school in memory of Jordan, and counselling was being provided to pupils saddened by the loss of their classmate. Mr Bayston said: 'The school was deeply shocked and saddened to hear the news yesterday of Jordan's death at his home. Jordan was a lively Year 7 student who had a particular passion and talent for art. 'The school is providing counselling for students and staff during this very difficult time. We have also arranged a special 'tribute room' where students can leave messages, flowers and mementos and spend some quiet time reflecting upon this sad loss. 'Our thoughts and sympathies go out to Jordan's family.' North Yorkshire Police have launched an investigation into Jordan's death. A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'The death is not being treated as suspicious and no-one else is being sought in connection with the incident.

"President Obama has hit back at Michael Jordan's claims he's a 's***ty golfer' - and suggested he pays more attention to his struggling basketball team. The NBA legend made the quip about the president in an interview with former NFL star Ahmad Rashad last month, adding that he wouldn't play a round of golf with Obama because he's a 'hack'. But the commander-in-chief appeared to laugh off the criticisms as he spoke to Wisconsin radio station WJMR, saying he once played on a team with Rashad and won. 'Michael wasn't very well informed about this,' he said. 'I think he just might have been trying to give Ahmad an extra ratings boost on his show.' Scroll down for audio . Having the last laugh: President Obama reponded to Michael Jordan's criticism of his golf ability by suggesting the basketball legend focuses less on his game and more on his losing basketball team . Not happy: Jordan reacts to a call during a Hornets game in 2013 - the team is currently 1-3 down . He went on: 'But there is no doubt that Michael is a better golfer than I am. Of course if I was playing twice a day for the last 15 years, then that might not be the case. 'He might want to spend more time thinking about the Bobcats... or the Hornets.' Jordan owns the Hornets, which are currently down 1-3. The jab came a week after the basketball legend made the remarks during an interview for Back9 with Rashad, who asked him who he would pick for his 'foursome' in a round of golf. First Jordan, 51, said he would choose golfing legend Arnold Palmer, and he then named Obama. 'I've never played with Obama, but I would,' he said, before promptly changing his mind. 'But no - that's OK - I'd take him out. He's a hack. I'd be there all day playing with him.' 'Do you really want to say that?' Rashad asked, looking at the camera, bemused. 'He's the President of the United States - he's a hack?' Jordan added: 'I never said he wasn't a great politician. I'm just saying he's a s***ty golfer.' Not up to par: President Barack Obama, left, who has played 200 rounds of golf since being in office, has a handicap of around 18, while Jordan, pictured right, has an impressive 3 handicap . Teed off: Obama has spent more time golfing than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings . Jordan has a 3 handicap, according to Golf Digest. Obama by comparison 'strives' for a handicap of 18, Don Van Natta Jr., who tracks presidential golfing habits, recently told The New York Times. The president played his 200th round of golf while in office earlier this month - a staggering number considering Tiger Woods has played around 270 games in that time. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner have all teed off with Obama at some point. But even though his obsession has been the butt of Republican jokes, he's far from reaching the presidential record. According to Van Natta's book, First Off the Tee, Woodrow Wilson was estimated to have played 1,200 rounds of golf in office, but it could have been as high as 1,600. Dwight Eisenhower is the runner-up at 800. He even set up a green outside the Oval Office and visited Augusta National so often that he got his own cabin on the club's grounds.","Basketball legend said in an interview last week that he would like to play golf with the president - before backtracking and calling him a 'hack'

"When most of us make a spelling misteak, er, mistake, at work a quick tap on the delete button usually does the trick. But that option clearly wasn’t available to road markers in Carlisle whose KEEP CEEAR error at the civic centre was gleefully reported by drivers. Contractors have corrected the mistake, which appeared last week, free of charge, and Cumbria County Council has apologised. Ceear-ly wrong: A bemused passer-by stops to look at the spelling mistake at the Civic Centre in Carlisle . Councillor Willie Whalen said: . 'Anybody can make a mistake. I think it is a genuine mistake, it doesn’t . look to be anything else. It really shows how hard the lads are . working.' Cyril Weber, chairman of the council’s . Carlisle local committee, said: 'It’s just a basic human error.' He . added: 'I am sure most people would be aware of what it means, in spite . of the spelling. Meanwhile in York, gas workers have . dug up road bricks with double yellow lines on before placing them back . into the road in different positions - making one of the lines barely . recognisable. The double yellow lines in now look . more like a scene from classic computer puzzle game Tetris after the . Northern Gas workers finished their handiwork last Friday. And until the surface was put back to normal yesterday, drivers were left unsure of the parking restrictions. Road markings on a York street ended up looking more like a game of Tetris than double yellow lines after builders bodged the job of relaying the bricks . The jumbled road markings resemble vintage video game Tetris, but Northern Gas says it has put them right . Computer classic: A modern version of the game called Tetris Blitz is pictured, available for free on iTunes . One of the world's most popular computer games, Tetris first appeared in 1984. It was created by Russian programmer Alexy Pajitnov while was studying computer science in Moscow. The catchy theme tune was based on a 19th century Russian folk song called 'Korobeiniki', before it was arranged by Hirokazu Tanaka - also behind the music in Super Mario Land. It is notoriously addictive - and a condition called the Tetris Effect was named after the game to explain when people spend so much time doing something that it begins to pattern their thoughts and dreams. Tetris was said to have got its name from the 'tetra' prefix in 'tetramino' - a geometric shape made of four squares, connected at right angles to each other - and 'tennis', Mr Pajitnov's favourite sport. One passerby, speaking before the . bricks had been fixed, said: 'It looks as if someone has left a trail of . scrambled egg down the street. 'I can't see how they can enforce the parking restrictions until they get some new double yellow lines painted.' Another . bystander, also speaking before the works were complete, said: 'They . could get the contractors to rearrange all the bricks, but I think that . might be rather expensive and I doubt they could figure it out. 'It's . probably far easier for the council to paint some new double yellows. It shouldn't take them long, after all they've had enough practice. 'They'd better hurry up though. This . is not a very wide road and if a couple of drivers decide to take . advantage it could cause traffic chaos.' A City of York Council spokesman said . that the works had been completed four and a half weeks ahead of . schedule by Northern Gas. Although parking restrictions in the area . remained in force throughout, no-one received a ticket over the weekend. And Northern Gas said that the jumbled surface, which have now been fixed, were all part of a plan to ensure a . professional and even finish. A . spokesman for the firm, which is . currently upgrading 0.75 miles of metal gas mains in York city centre, said the lines were fixed yesterday so as not to cause disruption during . the busy weekend - and the existing yellow marks were burned off before yellow lines were repainted.","York gas workers put road surfacing bricks back in the wrong order .

"He is supposed to have his hands full running the country. But David Cameron looked the picture of a relaxed dad this morning as he stepped out of Downing Street with daughter Florence in one arm and a dolly’s pram in the other. Embarrassingly it came on the day the government warned too many families struggle to fit their own childcare around their working lives. Hands full: David Cameron emerged from Number 10 this morning carrying daughter Florence and her toys . The Prime Minister was seen emerging from Number 10 early this morning, with two-year-old Florence cradled in his left arm. His other hand was struggling with a pink doll’s pram and a purple scooter. For many dads the idea of taking their children to school or nursery before work is all but impossible. A new report published today said childcare is a ‘major concern for many families’ and parents face ‘huge difficulties’ in find the right care at the right price. But Mr Cameron appeared not to have a care in the world as he made his way along Downing Street with his youngest daughter. Family time: Mr Cameron has spoken of his desire to take his children to school or nursery once a week . On the move: Tourists and people heading to work will have been surprised to see the Prime Minister out and about . He found himself with some extra time in his diary this morning after the meeting of Cabinet was moved to Thursday. He was later seen helping Florence as she struggled with her scooter on the streets of Whitehall on the way to her nursery. After dropping her off, the Prime Minister returned to Downing Street where he tried to coax Larry the Cat through the famous door of Number 10. Later he travelled to Lincoln for a question and answer session with workers at Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery. Helping hand: The Prime Minister tried to help Florence to stop her blocking the way for cyclists and pedestrians . Rush hour: As two-year-old Florence scooted along, the Prime Minister was left holding the baby . The Prime Minister has insisted on . taking his children to school or nursery as often as possible, to keep . his feet on the ground. Asked . about being seen on the school run last year he responded by saying: . 'Maybe once a week, sometimes once a fortnight, tragically sometimes . once a month I manage to take my children to school, but it's got to be . possible to be a decent husband, a good father and a good prime minister . at the same time.' Prowl: Larry the Downing Street cat was also out and about this morning . Animal magic: It took some persuasion, but eventually the Prime Minister managed to coax Larry through the door of Number 10 . Mr Cameron added that there is ‘something wrong’ if it is not possible to be Prime Minister and also spend time with family. ‘Actually I would go further than that, the big thing you have to do as prime minister is make a lot of judgement calls and decisions. 'The British public are incredibly fair minded, they know you will get, hopefully, a lot of them right. They know you'll get some of them wrong. 'What they want to know is that your average doesn't fall too low.' Day job: Later Mr Cameron travelled to Lincoln to take questions from workers .

"Rio Ferdinand has been involved in a furious exchange with FA chairman Greg Dyke after the governing body released the reasoning behind their decision to ban him for three games. The QPR defender was branded reckless and irresponsible by FA chiefs after using the word ‘sket’ — slang for a promiscuous woman — in an exchange with another Twitter user on September 1. Highlighting his profile as a role model, the FA’s Independent Regulatory Commission gave their written judgment into the reasoning behind the punishments, which also include a £25,000 fine and an educational programme. Rio Ferdinand has been told he 'should have known better'  by the FA in relation to his three-match ban . QPR defender Ferdinand was given a three-game suspension by the FA and will not appeal his ban . Ferdinand is regular Twitter user, having sent more than 14,000 Tweets since setting up an account in 2010 . It is understood Ferdinand, who served the first game of his ban last Saturday when he missed the game against Chelsea, made it clear to Dyke last week he no longer wished to be involved in any FA initiatives. Now, in a damning statement, the Commission reported: ‘With nearly six million followers Mr Ferdinand is clearly an experienced Twitter user and he should know better than to respond in the way that he did. ‘It is said on his behalf that he is one of the most high profile sportsmen on Twitter and he is a role model for many young people, no doubt throughout the world. His responsibility is therefore that much greater than many others. ‘Unfortunately there is no formal or direct admission and there is certainly no sign of remorse.’ It is the second-time that Ferdinand has been reprimanded for an offensive tweet aimed at someone by the FA . In 2012 the defender was fined £45,000 by the FA for using the term 'choc ice' targeted towards Ashley Cole . Ferdinand was charged with misconduct for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' - the FA deemed the tweet 'abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper' with a reference to gender . Ferdinand's activity on social media - with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page - saw him punished harshly . Ferdinand tweeted his anger at the FA's punishment on Friday - the FA say he didn't show remorse . Joey Barton took to Twitter to support his team-mate Ferdinand, describing his ban as 'an absolute disgrace' While Ferdinand's lawyers said it was a joke, expert opinion, the FA write, explain the word sket 'is a term of abuse and in this context would be taken as insulting' Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter .

"Hidden since the Romans ruled Britain, this extraordinary sculpture was perfectly preserved for 1,900 years beneath a busy street. The carvings on the 26in high eagle are so crisp that when archaeologists unearthed it last month they feared it was a much later copy rather than an original Roman relic. But experts at the Museum of London Archaeology confirmed that the sculpture from a high-ranking official’s tomb dates from the 1st or 2nd century AD, and is one of only two statues of its type in the world. The other was found in Jordan in 1937. The sculpture features an eagle grasping a writhing serpent in its beak and is thought to symbolise the struggle of good against evil. It came out of the ground 'covered in soil and unrecognisable' in September in the last few hours of an excavation that had lasted several months . The eagle signifies a force of good in Roman art. It is also a symbol of Jupiter, chief of the Roman gods, who was one of the most popular of the time . The fact the creature is eating a snake shows it has triumphed over evil and death, Michael Marshall, Roman finds expert at MOLA told MailOnline. In Roman art eagles are often depicted carrying the souls of Roman emperors to the gods - making the mortal divine. This makes the newly discovered eagle a suitable subject for a sculpture placed in the mausoleum of a rich Roman Londoner, Mr Marshall added. Archaeologists also unearthed foundations . of a mausoleum on the east London site and believe that the statue, . dating from the first or second century AD and made from oolitic . limestone from the Cotswolds, once adorned it. The sculpture was pulled from the site on the Minories, a street in the City of London that is close to the Tower of London. It came out of the ground 'covered in soil and unrecognisable' in September in the last few hours of an excavation that had lasted several months. It is said to be in such good condition that archaeologists could not believe it is 1,900 years old and were initially hesitant to announce the find until it had been seen by several experts. The sculpture features an eagle grasping a writhing serpent in its beak and is thought to symbolise the struggle of good (the eagle) against evil (the snake). It also has details such as the forked tongue of the snake and the individual feathers of the eagle. The object, which is 65cm tall and 55cm wide, is thought to have been placed in an alcove at the mausoleum, which likely belonged to a wealthy Londoner . The sculpture was discovered in the final hours of a dig at a London building site (pictured) which will be the location of a 16-storey hotel . Mr Marshall told MailOnline there is currently no evidence to suggest the sculpture was painted, but many statues of the time were. Experts carefully examine the statue to check for any microscopic flakes of paint that might remain on it. Paint rarely survives on such statues, but Mr Marshall said that as the item is in such good condition, it is the 'best bet' of finding paint flakes if it was indeed painted. Michael Marshall, finds specialist at Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA), told MailOnline there are many candidates to whom the tomb might have belonged as there was an influx of wealthy Romans living in Briton at the time who were officials, merchants and army officers. The sculpture was probably chosen to please the god Jupiter and depict the triumph of good over death and evil, but it was also a way for wealthy families to show off and commemorate the dead, he said. The item could also have played a protective role if the person was a member of the 'cult of Jupiter' which was incredibly popular at the time, Mr Marshall added. Such a statue, that depicts the symbol of the god could 'help ensure the person was safe after death,' he said. Images of eagles and serpents are typically Roman and the discovery has helped experts understand what the cemeteries and tombs outside the city walls looked like. It was already known that a celebrated school of Romano-British sculptors worked in the Cotswolds, but only a few fragments of their work have been previously found. Reverend Professor Martin Henig, a leading expert in the field, said that the object was 'the finest sculpture by a Romano-British artist ever found in London and amongst the very best statues surviving from Roman Britain'. The sculpture was found on the Minories - a street in the City of London close to the Tower of London and Aldgate Tube station. It was unearthed at a building site that is being prepared for the building of a 16-storey hotel. The find also lies in an area that is thought to be the location of Roman cemeteries, near London's Roman wall, which is shown on the map . Mr Marshall, added: 'The eagle is a classically Roman symbol and this new find provides a fascinating new insight into the inhabitants of Roman London and demonstrates their familiarity with the iconography of the wider classical world. 'Funerary sculpture from the city is . very rare and this example, perhaps from inside a mausoleum, is a . particularly fine example which will help us to understand how the . cemeteries and tombs that lined the roads out of the city were furnished . and the beliefs of those buried there.' MOLA . project manager Louise Davies said it was an archaeologist's dream to . find such a beautiful sculpture, adding: 'The fact that we found it on . the last day of the dig was a real bonus.' The object will go on display for six months at the Museum of London from tomorrow. The eagle was found near foundations of a Roman mausoleum, (pictured right) where it is thought to have been kept and is a rare example of funerary sculpture that could shed light on how the cemeteries and tombs that lined the roads out of the city were furnished and the beliefs of those buried there. MOLA Conservator Luisa Duarte cleans the sculpture (left) Caroline . McDonald, senior curator of Roman London at the Museum of London, told . MailOnline: 'What I love about this discovery is what it reveals about . London 1,900 years ago. 'Here . is a city of around 30,000 people where the mechanics of life are . intertwined with the mythical. One Roman Londoner climbs the social . ladder and leaves a family rich enough to mark their passing with an . extraordinary piece of art. 'Meanwhile . this magnificent eagle protects the deceased, frozen in an eternal . struggle to hold evil at bay. It is money and magic captured in stone. I can’t wait to see it on display at the Museum of London for the public to see.' Eagles killing snakes were popular subjects in Roman art.

"Speeding scam: Olivia Flood, 27, feared six points would ruin her chances of driving the school minibus so she came up with the scam . A schoolmistress tried to change the appearance of her car to dodge six speeding points because she was worried they might end her participation in the school's Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. Geography teacher Olivia Flood, 27, was not even facing a driving ban after being caught speeding twice in ten minutes in a 30mph zone. But she feared the points would ruin her chances of driving her pupils in a school minibus to an event in Edinburgh organised by the Royal youth charity. So she dreamt up a scam in which she added GB stickers to her Fiat Punto, fitted a rectangular tax disc holder and added a tow bar holder before claiming it was a different car that had been caught speeding. Flood, who was in charge of Duke of Edinburgh pupils at Siddall Moor sports college in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, sent in photographs of her newly modified car which showed a GB sticker in the rear windscreen and further stickers on the bumper. She urged officials to match it against the vehicle their camera snapped twice in ten minutes travelling at 41mph and the other at 43mph. She hoped her scheme would convince officials that they had instead caught a cloned car speeding. But the DVLA was immediately suspicious and Flood, who is currently 28 weeks pregnant, was arrested. She was later hauled before Manchester Crown Court where she pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. She was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 12 months after a judge said the scam was 'foolish and foolhardy.' She was also ordered to carry out 80 hours unpaid work and pay £500 costs. Despite the conviction she is expected to keep her job. Flood's fall from grace began in June last year after headteachers at Siddall Moor where has worked for six years gave her responsibility to organise pupils for Duke of Edinburgh Award Schemes and other outdoor education. At 10.22am on 1 June 2012 her L-registered Fiat Punto was snapped driving at 43mph on Manchester Road, Heywood, and minutes later at 10.32am the same vehicle was recorded travelling at 41mph in the opposite direction. Two speeding tickets were sent to Flood but the following month she called the Central Ticket Office saying it was not her car as she would have been in school at the time and asked for photographic evidence. In August she sent back the two notices along with a letter and three images she herself took of her vehicle along with a copy of a 'signing in and out sheet' from her workplace. In the letter, Flood said that it could not have been her vehicle due to her being at work at the time of the offences. Caught: Flood is clocked doing 43mph in a 30 zone in Rochdale, Greater Manchester in June 2012 . Again: Ten minutes later she is clocked breaking the limit agin, this time driving in the opposite direction down the same road . She wrote: 'There are features of the car which are not present on the photographic evidence I received. My car has had a smaller, silver tax disc holder for around a year. I have a GB sticker in the rear windscreen. My car also has no tow bar cover.' But a search on computer systems for . vehicles of the same registration returned several images from 2, 6, 7 . and 29 June 2012 which showed the Fiat was the same as the vehicle . caught speeding - except without the stickers tow bar, rectangular tax . disc holder. Officers suspected the car's appearance had been deliberately changed and arrested Flood in December last year. Modifications: Flood put a different sort of tax disc (centre) and a GB . sticker on her car (bottom) in an effort to convince the DVLA they had . caught a cloned car speeding. She also made modifications to the front . of the car (top). These pictures are from the Greater Manchester Police dossier of evidence . In . mitigation defence lawyer Mr Gwyn Lewis, said : 'The only reason Mrs . Flood tried to avoid prosecution was because she knew she needed a clean . driving licence to drive the school minibus that takes the pupils to . Duke of Edinburgh locations - an activity which is entirely voluntary. 'Mrs Flood changed the appearance of her car to avoid getting points on her licence, and she was wrong to do that. 'She . did not realise the seriousness of what she did until she was arrested. In those six months since her husband Daniel has described her as . having ""daily tears"". 'She has become depressed, so depressed that she has considered taking her own life and has been prescribed antidepressants. Scam: Flood was arrested at school and later charged with perverting the course of justice. She pleaded guilty but avoided a jail term . 'The head teacher of her school has given a character reference, in which he has stated that Mrs Flood may keep her job if she does not go to prison. If she goes to prison she will be dismissed and not be able to continue her career. 'Mrs Flood's mother is currently ill with cancer. Mrs Flood is her mother's rock'. Passing sentence Judge Richard Mansell . QC told Flood: 'Let me make this clear: this is an exceptional case and . you have only avoided custody because of the exceptional circumstances. Impeccable character alone is not enough and this an individual case. 'These . types of offences strike at the heart of the whole system, which relies . on the honesty of drivers. Prison sentences invariably follow for this . type of offence. 'You are an exceptionally talented teacher. You have worked at Siddal Moor school for six years. You earn a good salary. 'The . reason why you tried to avoid the charges speaks for itself - you . wanted to continue to be able to take pupils to and from DoE locations. This foolhardy offence was not for foolish reasons. You did this to . avoid embarrassment at school. 'You have shown great remorse since your arrest and you have learned a lesson. Speeding fine: Oliva Flood's car, parked outside her home in Middleton, which she tried to 'modify' so she would be let off the hook for two speeding offences . 'Unlike others who try to get pregnant after their arrest to avoid custody, you were pregnant at the time of the arrest, and your baby is due in August. 'Taking this into account along with the fact that your mother is suffering with acute myeloid leukaemia, you will have your baby in an ordinary way. You will be able to undertake some light community work in the two months before your baby is born. After the case PC Mark Casey, from Greater Manchester said: 'Flood has gone to some quite extraordinary lengths to try and avoid speeding fines. 'This case proves that the consequences of not facing up to motoring offences can be significantly magnified when you try and lie yourself out of trouble. 'While it ties up resources, we will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute where we believe serious offences have been committed and I want to highlight this case to send out a stark warning to other motorists.'","Olivia Flood, 27, was caught speeding twice down the same road in the space of 10 minutes .

"MPs have been banned from bringing in a cat to catch mice in Parliament because they cannot be trusted not to feed it scraps. Commons Speaker John Bercow warned ‘well-meaning’ politicians would give the cat treats, leaving it too fat to bother chasing rodents. He also ruled that some people in Parliament might be allergic to a cat, which would also be at risk of being run over on Whitehall’s busy roads. There are more than 200 official sightings of mice every year in Parliament, in the bars and restaurants . The Houses of Parliament are plagued . with mice, with staff often seeing them running across desks or . scurrying along the corridors of power. Every . year more than 200 sightings are reported to the authorities, although . the true figure is likely to be much higher because many people have . given up complaining. There have been growing calls for a resident cat to be brought in to help deal with the problem. But . the idea has been rejected by officials on health and safety grounds. Mr Bercow has written to MPs warning of the practical problems. Lib . Dem MP John Thurso, a spokesman for the Commons Commission, said one of . the obsctales was ‘the likelihood that well-meaning colleagues would . feed a cat, making it unlikely that it would catch mice’. He added: ‘A cat would be at risk from the 1,748 poisonous bait stations used across the estate to control pest populations.’ MPs have been rebuffed in their call for a cat to prowl Parliament to deal with a mouse problem . Officials were also concerned about the ‘effect on people who are allergic to cats’. ‘There would be no reliable way to stop the cat getting on to the busy roads which surround us, nor of looking after the cat responsibly,’ he added. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home had offered rescue cat to prowl the parliamentary estate, but this has been declined. Mr Thurso added: ‘The size, age and location of the Parliamentary Estate make controlling mice and pests a major undertaking.’ Last year there were 221 mouse sighting reported in Parliament, down from 254 in 2012 but up on 195 in 2011. Larry the Downing Street cat was brought in to deal with vermin, but was accused of lacking killer instinct . It included three sightings in the Members’ Tea Room last year and another nine in the Terrace Cafeteria. The cost of pest control including mice in 2012-13 was £73,522.12. In early 2011 David Cameron rejected calls for a cat to be brought in to deal with a rat infestation in Downing Street. But weeks later he agreed to home Larry, a four-year-old tabby. After winning over staff in Number 10, he soon fell victim to a briefing operation against him for failing to catch any mice. ‘There is a distinct lack of killer instinct,’ a source said. The fur flew when George Osborne then brought in his own cat, Freya, who regularly gets into fights with Larry.","MPs asked to have a cat to deal with mice infestation in Parliament .

"Drunk at school: Music teacher Neil Bowden drove back to school three times over the drink-drive limit after having lunch at a nearby pub . A high school teacher who drove back to school after a drunken pub lunch has been caught three times over the drink-drive limit. Neil Bowden - a music teacher for eight years - quit his job at Trinity High School in Hulme, Manchester, after staff suspected he was under the influence when he returned from lunch at a pub just a couple of hundred yards from the school gates. The 35-year-old from Stockport, Greater Manchester pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol at Manchester City Magistrates’ Court. Tess Kenyon, prosecuting, told how the headteacher was waiting for Bowden when he drove into the school car park just after 2pm. Staff had suspected Bowden was under the influence of drink before going to the Ducie Arms in Hulme, on June 5. The court heard that several empty cider bottles were found in his car and Bowden had been drinking the night before and resumed drinking at 11 o’clock the next morning. Bowden admitted he had driven to and from the nearby pub. Believing that Bowden was drunk, the headteacher called police. A breath test showed he had 118 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the drink-drive limit is 35. Bowden had fully co-operated with police and entered his guilty plea at the earliest opportunity, the court heard. Peter Belshaw, defending, said his client had to accept that he may have been over the limit when he drove to work that morning. The court heard that prior to the incident he was a man of ‘unblemished reputation’. Mr Belshaw said: ‘He wishes to express his deep remorse and contrition over what happened. He has always set for himself the highest professional standards.’ Bowden was given a 28-month driving ban, sentenced to carry out 80 hours of unpaid community work and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 surcharge. After the hearing, Trinity head David Ainsworth said: ‘The situation happened at lunchtime.  Mr Bowden did not teach in the afternoon and the following day I accepted his resignation with immediate effect.’ Suspected ciders: The headteacher at Trinity High School was waiting for Bowden when he returned to school after having lunch at the Ducie Arms (pictured), just a couple of hundred yards from the school gates. Empty cider bottles were found in his car, the court heard . In 2011, primary school teacher Penny Truman got so drunk on her lunch break that the headteacher thought she had suffered a stroke but paramedics who examined her found she was simply inebriated. The teacher at a school in Putney, south-west London attempted to teach four and five-year-olds after downing an entire bottle of wine. Malcolm West, a teacher entrusted with instructing pupils at a public school how to use firearms at a school in Kent, was charged after he drove into a garden wall while twice the drink-drive limit.

Smacked Mido in the face after the striker threw scissors at him . But left the room with his arm round him 10 minutes later . Dragged Juventus star Chiellini along the ground during a dispute . In part two of extracts of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's explosive autobiography I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the striker tells of fist fights with team-mates and trying to evade the law in fast cars. I joined AC Milan in 2010 and our biggest league match was approaching. The Milan derby against Inter, whose most passionate fans — the Ultras — were going to hate me. On top of that, I had issues with Oguchi Onyewu, a guy in my team. He was an American the size of a house, and I told a mate in the squad: ‘Something serious is gonna happen. I just feel it.’ Onyewu resembled a heavyweight boxer. He was nearly 6ft 5in and weighed over 15 stone, but he couldn’t handle me. He accused me of trash talking, but that wasn’t true. People trash talk me. I’ve heard so much s**t over the years: ‘F****** gypsy’, stuff about my mum — all that stuff. I retaliate with my body, not with words. Roar passion: But sometimes Zlatan Ibrahimovic gets too wound up and fights with his team-mates . Rage: Ibrahimovic documents his disputes with a number of team-mates . Built like a heavyweight boxer: But Ibrahimovic still had a fight with Mailan team-mate Oguchi Onyewu . I told Onyewu I did not trash talk, but he just kept on. He shushed me with his finger. Then he did it again. I saw red. I didn’t say anything, not a word. That b****** was going to find out how I trash-talk! The next time he got the ball in training, I rushed towards him and jumped up with my feet and studs out in front — the worst type of tackle. But he saw me and leapt out of the way. As we both crashed to the ground, my first thought was: ‘S**t! I’ve missed!’ As I got up and walked away I felt a blow to my shoulder. Not a good idea, Oguchi Onyewu. I headbutted him, and we flew at each other. We wanted to tear each other limb from limb. It was brutal. We were rolling around, punching and kneeing each other. We were crazy and furious — it was like life and death. Afterwards, the weirdest thing happened. Onyewu started praying to God with tears in his eyes, making the sign of the cross. This felt like a provocation, and I got more furious. I was stopped by my team-mates, and I suppose that was a good thing. It could have turned out nasty. All the time, I was thinking: ‘S***, my chest hurts,’ so we had it checked out. I’d broken a rib in the fight. It was not the first time I’d had a dispute with a team-mate. Threat: Ibrahimovic (right) vowed he would break the legs of Rafael van der Vaart (centre) during one outburst . Scissor kick: Mido threw some scissors at Ibrahimovic during a row - but the pair walked out of the room minutes later as good friends! It's not just his own team-mates he gets involved with: The striker gets involved in a scrap between Inter Milan and Valencia in 2007 . Seeing red: Paris Saint-Germain's star striker is sent off against Valencia earlier this year . In 2004, I was playing for Sweden . against Holland, whose team included many of my Ajax club colleagues. It . was a friendly but the entire Sweden squad was out for revenge for our . loss in the Euro 2004 tournament. We wanted to prove we could beat . Holland. Early on in the . match I got a ball outside the penalty area and immediately had four . Dutchmen on me. One of them was my team-mate, Rafael van der Vaart, who . went on to play for Tottenham. I powered my way through the challenges, . and Van der Vaart was left lying in pain on the pitch. He was taken off on a stretcher with a torn ankle ligament. Nothing serious, but he might miss a match or two. He . claimed in the papers that I’d injured him on purpose. What kind of . **** was that? There wasn’t even a free-kick awarded! That guy was . supposed to be my team captain! I phoned Van der Vaart: ‘Listen up, I’m . sorry, it’s a shame about your injury, but it wasn’t intentional. You . got that?’ He didn’t back . down even a millimetre. When we returned to Ajax, the atmosphere became . more and more heated. Finally, Ronald Koeman, the coach, called us into a . meeting. By that time I was completely obsessed. We . all sat in a circle in our lunch room, and I immediately sensed the . seriousness of the situation. You could feel it in the air. ‘Zlatan did it on purpose,’ said Van der Vaart, and I saw red. ‘I . didn’t injure you on purpose, and you know that. If you accuse me again . I’ll break both your legs, and that time it will be on purpose,’ I . said. Feud: Former team-mates Ibrahimovic (right) and Giorgio Chiellini had a run in during a game . 'Cowardly': Chiellini tried to provoke Ibrahimovic with a tackle from behind, says the striker . Grappling: Ibrahimovic and Chiellini have had plenty more on-field battles since . While at Ajax, my . friend Mido, who went on to play in the Premier League, declared . publicly that he wanted to be transferred. He wasn’t exactly a diplomat; . he was worse than me. After one match, when he’d been on the bench . against Eindhoven, he came into the locker room and called us all . miserable c****. I . responded by saying if anybody was a c*** it was him. Mido picked up a . pair of scissors and flung them at me. It was completely nuts. The . scissors whizzed past my head, straight into the concrete wall and made a . crack in it. I went over . and gave him a smack, but 10 minutes later we left with our arms around . each other. Much later I discovered our team manager had kept those . scissors as a souvenir, to show his kids.It wasn’t all about fighting with team-mates. I . remember facing Giorgio Chiellini, a centre back who is now the . vice-captain of Italy. We had played at Juventus and he tried to provoke . me with a cowardly tackle from behind. I . went down in a lot of pain but didn’t say anything. I took my revenge . after the final whistle, grabbing his head and dragging him along like a . disobedient dog. I could see Chiellini was scared.  ‘You wanted to . fight. So how come you’re s******g yourself now,’ I hissed before . heading off to the changing room. On the receiving end: Ibrahimovic takes an elbow in the face from Lucio and (below) one from Michael Dawson . Zlatan Ibrahimovic fights for the ball with Michael Dawson . I love cars, but sometimes I drive like a maniac. Me and a friend took a new Porsche Turbo out on the roads in Sweden. I stepped on the gas and got it up to 155mph. When I slowed down, we heard police sirens.I couldn’t just stop, apologise and hand over my licence. The police boxed in about four cars behind us. I had Dutch number plates, which they couldn’t trace, so I floored it and hit 190mph. The 'wee, wee' of the sirens became fainter and fainter. It was like a film as we nipped into an underpass and waited until the police had disappeared. Another time, we weren’t so lucky. I drove with a friend along the street where all the prostitutes in Malmo wait for punters. We saw a woman leaning over a car, talking to a client, and decided to have some fun. I slammed on the brakes and rushed over yelling: ‘Police. Put your hands up!’ The old man was totally scared and tore out of there. Minutes later, he turned up in a police car. ‘It was a joke,’ I explained. The cops laughed, but a photographer appeared  and snapped a photo. Idiot that I was, I put on a huge grin.

"He was taking part in a protest to mark the anniversary of a wave of demonstrations against  the high cost of living and other social issues . TV cameras and photographers have captured the dramatic moment an Israeli protester set himself on fire during a rally. The man in his 40s poured flammable liquid over himself at a protest in Tel Aviv before setting himself alight in front of shocked onlookers. People crowded around, trying to put out . the flames with shirts and water. Others could be heard shouting . 'medic' and 'bring water quickly.' Scroll down for video . Horrific: TV cameras and photographers captured the dramatic moment an Israeli protester set himself on fire during a rally. Protesters are pictured trying to extinguish the flames . Protest: Flames are seen seconds after a man set himself on fire. Other demonstrators can be seen right looking on in shock . The man was taking part in a protest on Saturday night to mark the anniversary of a wave of demonstrations against  the high cost of living and other social issues which swept the country. Israel's Channel 10 TV showed footage of the man on fire. He left a letter blaming the government for his financial difficulties. He was later rushed to a hospital where he is now being treated for serious burns. Cases of self-immolation - when a person sets themselves on fire  - as a form of protest are rare in Israel, and it is not clear what prompted the man to set himself alight. In 2005, a woman died of burns sustained after she set herself on fire to protest Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip when the government evicted thousands of Israelis from their homes. Burns: People crowded around, trying to put out the flames with shirts and water. Others could be heard shouting 'medic' and 'bring water quickly' Emergency: The man was later rushed to a hospital where he is now being treated for serious burns . Outside of Israel, the most famous recent case of self-immolation took place in Tunisia, where fruit-seller Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in December 2010, helping set off the country's uprising - and with it, the Arab Spring. Saturday's rally in Tel Aviv took place at the same time as one in Jerusalem. Some of the few thousand people who turned out carried signs reading 'social justice for everybody' and 'stop exploiting us.' Saturday's demonstrations were part of an effort to re-energise a protest movement which began last July with complaints about housing prices but quickly shifted to a wide range of social economic issues like high food costs, low wages and better education. Anger: Demonstrators march through the streets of Tel Aviv to protest against rising housing costs last night . Fury: Growing discontent among Israelis over housing prices and other social inequalities have spurred marches, boycotts and labor strikes in the Jewish state . Not happy: Some of the few thousand people who turned out carried signs reading 'social justice for everybody' and 'stop exploiting us' Hundreds of thousands of people marched in the demonstrations last year, and protest camps sprouted up in city centres across the country. About half a million Israelis took to the streets when the protest movement peaked last year. Demonstrations dwindled out soon after the government set up a committee it said would provide solutions to the wide array of social issues plaguing Israelis. Protest leader Daphni Leef said Saturday that little has changed since then.

"Graeme Souness has torn into the Manchester City squad in the wake of their Champions League loss to CSKA Moscow, claiming the players 'are not world class'. City went a goal down early on, and despite a fantastic free-kick from Yaya Toure, suffered a disappointing 2-1 loss to put their chances of qualifying for the knock-out stages in serious jeopardy. Speaking after the match on Sky Sports, Souness said: 'A short few months ago we were talking about these players being world class but we can tell now that they're not world class because world class players respond and these players have been found wanting.'

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (left) remonstrates with referee Tasos Sidiropoulos . Referee Sidiropoulos, who was taking charge of only his second Champions League game, immediately reached for his yellow card but showed it to Sergei Ignashevic instead of Wernbloom in an apparant case of mistaken identity. Man City captain Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure pointed out the error to the Greek official but their appeals were waved away. A few minutes later a frustrated Toure pushed Roman Eremenko to the floor and was shown a straight red card. Manchester City's Yaya Toure is fouled by CSKA Moscow's Pontus Wernbloom (left) Asked for his opinions on the moments of controversy, Pellegrini said: 'I think it is not my duty to analyse the referee's performance. It is your duty to decide if he made a good decision or bad decision. 'Today the difference was not just the mistakes of the referee. I think we cannot play the way we played today if we want to win. 'I don't want to have any excuse about the way we played. That's why I don't want to link the referee with the result.' Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho, left, is shown second yellow card . Pellegrini refused to comment on the Fernandinho and Toure red cards, but said he needs to get a better performance from his side if it is to reach the knockout stages of the competition. 'It's a crisis of confidence, of course, I don't understand why but we must find a reason, talk with the players every day and try to win again,' Pellegrini said. The result leaves City bottom of Group E with just two points and facing a mountain to climb to reach the next stage with remaining games against Bayern Munich and Roma.

"The Red Cross yesterday declared the Syrian  conflict a civil war as Damascus denied using heavy weapons in an attack on a village that left scores dead. The significance of the move by the International Committee of the Red Cross is that international humanitarian law now applies throughout the country. This means that attacks on civilians and abuse or killing of detainees can constitute war crimes. Scroll down for video . Devastation: A Syrian boy walks past a burned-out house in the village of Treimsa, where rights activists say more than 150 people have been killed . The decision by the ICRC follows the escalation of the violence beyond the hotspots of Idlib, Homs and Hama. Yesterday a Syrian foreign ministry . spokesman claimed the attack on Tremseh last Thursday was not a massacre . – as activists have claimed – but a military operation targeting armed . fighters. He said 37 gunmen and two civilians . were killed – a far lower death toll than the estimates of up to 200 . dead put forward by anti-regime activists. But the head of the United Nations . observer mission has said monitors stationed near Tremseh saw the Syrian . army using heavy weaponry and helicopters. UN special envoy Kofi Annan is flying . to Moscow today to seek the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin – a . key ally of Syria’s President Bashar Assad – in ending the conflict . The UN confirmed that it had found pools of blood, a burned-out school and damage from the use of heavy weapons in Treimsa. But . the Syrian government dismissed suggestions that innocent people had . been attacked, claiming that 37 gunmen and only two civilians were . killed in clashes with rebels. Destruction: A Syrian woman sits with her grandson outside a damaged building on Treimsa's main street . Blast site: Syrians point to the spot where a shell apparently fell in Treimsa. The UN said there was evidence that heavy weapons had been used . Observers believe more than 150 . people were killed, which if confirmed would make it one of the . bloodiest episodes of Syria’s 16-month uprising. Fifteen . more people were killed elsewhere in the country today, activists said. Among them was a family of four, including a girl whose body was pulled . from rubble covered in blood and dust after their house was shelled in . the central town of Rastan. The . claims and counter-claims arose as UN-Arab League Kofi Annan prepared . to travel to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin on the . crisis. Russia . has been an ally of Syrian leader President Bashar al-Assad and his . government, but has come under increased international pressure to . support regime change. Panic: UN monitors confirmed that they had found pools of blood and a burned school in the village . Speaking at a news conference in the capital Damascus, foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said Syrian government forces did not use helicopters and tanks in the assault on Treimsa, which happened on Thursday. 'What happened was not an attack by the army on innocent civilians,' he added. 'The aim of this news conference is to tell people that what happened was not a massacre... It was a clash between regular forces and armed groups who do not believe in a peaceful solution. UN monitors are verifying reports of damage and killings in the village of Treimsa, north of the Syrian capital Damascus . 'This is the reality, politically and militarily.' Mr Makdissi staunchly denied reports suggesting the army had used aircraft in the assault. 'This is absolutely not true. Only troop carriers and lights weapons were used, the most powerful of weapons being RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),' he said. He admitted that 'the situation is . difficult on the ground' but insisted that Syria is 'in a state of . defence not in a state of attack'. 'Only five buildings where there were very sophisticated weapons were targeted,' he added. The spokesman's announcement came as UN monitors continued their investigation into what happened in the village. During a trip to the scene yesterday, they found blood and evidence of the use of heavy weapons as well as burned-out homes. Sausan . Ghosheh, spokeswoman for the supervision mission, said: 'On the basis . of this preliminary mission, UNSMIS can confirm that an attack, using a . variety of weapons, took place in Treimsa on July 12. 'The attack on Treimsa appeared targeted at specific groups and houses, mainly of army defectors and activists.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which made the claim of more than 150 fatalities, said it believed the army had been backed by pro-regime shabiha militiamen. If confirmed, the toll would exceed that of a massacre at Houla on May 25, when a pro-government militia and government forces were accused of killing at least 108 people. The killings have added urgency to deadlocked UN Security Council negotiations on a Syria resolution.

"A young mother was killed by an express train after jumping on to the tracks to retrieve her mobile phone. Charlene Pickering, 23, was arguing with boyfriend Daniel Pickett when she dropped the handset. It bounced several times on the platform before falling on to the tracks. Mr Pickett begged her to get back on to the platform, but  his pleas came too late as  she was hit by a train travelling at 60mph. The fatal tragedy sees Charlene Pickering 23, leave behind a son called Toby, aged 4 . Miss Pickering, from West Molesey, Surrey, was pronounced dead at the scene following the incident at Wimbledon station in south-west London at 7.30pm on Sunday. She leaves behind a four-year-old son, Toby. Before the accident, Miss Pickering and Mr Pickett had been to watch Chelsea beat Portsmouth in an FA Cup football match. Police and rail bosses are studying CCTV images, which are thought to have captured the full horror of what happened. A source close to the inquiry said: ‘The CCTV footage shows a young woman and her boyfriend arguing. She dropped her mobile phone which bounced on to the platform and on to the track. ‘She jumped down and got hit at 60mph. The boyfriend was shouting at her not to jump down.’ Alison Evans, British Transport Police Chief Inspector, said: ‘We believe at this stage that the woman went on to the tracks to retrieve her mobile phone before being struck by the train. ‘This appears to have been a tragic accident and our thoughts remain with the woman’s family at this very difficult and sad time for them.’ However, Miss Pickering’s step-father Guy Pollington said last night that the family did not believe she was looking for her phone. He said: ‘The coroner has said there is CCTV of her crouching down below the platform, the reasons for which we might never know. ‘No phone has ever been found.’ Last year passengers called for a speed limit to be introduced through Wimbledon Station after there were three rush-hour deaths within four months . He said their ‘world had been shattered’, adding: ‘Charlene was the light of our lives.’ Miss Pickering’s mother Pamela  was too upset to talk about her loss last night. Trains which pass through the station without stopping are allowed to travel at speeds of up to 75mph. Rail officials said there would have been ten express trains every hour on the evening of the accident. Yesterday Mr Pickett, 23, left a moving tribute to his girlfriend on Facebook. The pair met when they were pupils at Rydens School in Walton-on-Thames, but had only been a couple for four months. He wrote: ‘I would love to hear your voice just once more. ‘We had made so many plans and they have been so cruelly taken. The tragedy has reignited calls for more safety measures to be introduced at the station . ‘I will never forget you. Toby was so lucky to have you as a mum and he will be so proud of you and he will also make you proud.’ Other friends posted tributes on Twitter, with Lewis Brown writing: ‘I am lost for words, she was an amazing young mother.’ Andrew Kelly, a 23-year-old councillor from Walton-on-Thames, added: ‘Very shocked to hear of the death of an old school friend. Far, far too young.’ The tragedy has reignited calls for more safety measures. James Turnbull, 39, from Merton, who commutes from the station, said: ‘Some of these trains that don’t stop at Wimbledon or the freight trains  are so fast. It’s quite frightening.’","Charlene Pickering went to fetch handset after argument with boyfriend .

"Fernandinho and Yaya Toure were sent off as Manchester City crashed to a damaging 2-1 loss to CSKA in the Champions League. The pair were both dismissed in the second half as City struggled to get back into a Group E contest they were anxious to win to revive their campaign.

Yaya Toure is fighting back against racism on Twitter and fans booed the Champions League anthem on Wednesday night after being stopped from following their team to Moscow a fortnight ago. CSKA must play home games behind closed doors because of racism but City fans were furious some Russians got in to cheer their team in a 2-2 draw. A few CSKA fans got in despite a ban and were led away by police. Seydou Doumbia of CSKA Moscow scores the opening goal against Manchester City . Doumbia (left) celebrates scoring second goal by placing dummy in his mouth . The night air was thick with firework smoke, giving chilly east Manchester a feel of Dickensian London. So credit to two-goal CSKA striker Seydou Doumbia for coping so well with the conditions. Doumbia was born in the Ivory Coast’s capital Abidjan, where the average temperature in November is 30C. He was too hot for City. Fireworks are set off above the Etihad Stadium before the match to mark Bonfire night . Manchester City’s two-for-one ticket offer was only partially successful. They avoided a repeat of the embarrassing 10,000 empty seats for the Roma game. But hundreds were still queueing outside the stadium at kick-off time and the atmosphere once the game started was apathetic, particularly in a first half when the only serious noise after Toure’s leveller was jeers as the referee blew for half-time. Manchester City used a two-for-one ticket offer to avoid the embarrassment of empty seats . Manuel Pellegrini might have to acknowledge West Ham boss Sam Allardyce as his guru. Big Sam claimed Pellegrini needed to be more flexible to be successful in Europe. And after seeing his expensive line-up flop in the first half, the City manager took a leaf out of Allardyce’s book and replaced lightweights Stevan Jovetic and Jesus Navas at half-time for extra midfield bodies in Fernandinho and Samir Nasri. Not that it did him much good. Substitute Fernandinho lasted just 25 minutes before he was sent off for two bookable offences .","Manchester City fans booed the Champions League anthem on Wednesday .

"The wealthiest square in Paris was evacuated today after a huge fire broke out underneath the French capital's Ritz hotel. Dozens of people were treated for smoke inhalation and at least 15 luxury cars were destroyed in the blaze in a five-storey underground car park in Place Vendome. France’s Ministry of Justice was among buildings evacuated, along with numerous jewellery and designer fashion shops. Dozens of people were treated for smoke inhalation and at least 15 luxury cars were destroyed in the blaze in a five-storey underground car park in Place Vendome, Paris . Plumes of smoke shoot into the air following the blaze in an underground car park of the Ritz hotel. In the background is a statue of Napoleon atop the Column Vendome . As firemen fought the flames, there were fears for hundreds of visitors to the area, including celebrities attending Paris Fashion Week. ‘It’s a very big blaze,’ said Bastien Bosigard, spokesman for the city fire brigade. ‘The fire broke out on the second level of the five-level car park under Place Vendome. ‘At least one person has been overcome by the fumes, and medics are treating others at the scene. 'We don’t know what caused it yet – out priority is to put it out.’ As firemen fought the flames, there were fears for hundreds of visitors to the area, including celebrities attending Paris Fashion Week . By this evening, huge plumes of thick black smoke could still be seen pouring out of the historic square, which is a magnet for the super-rich. Hotels like the Paris Ritz  and Hyatt Place Vendome advertise rooms well in excess of £300 a night, with suites costing many thousands of pounds. Some 120 fire engines were at the scene, along around 30 ambulances and other emergency services vehicles. Meanwhile a security cordon was placed around the square, with all nearby roads shut off. Some hotel guests were seen being handed gas masks as they evacuated buildings, while a police officer at the scene said ‘at least 15 cars’ including Mercedes limousines had gone up in smoke.","Dozens in Place Vendome treated for smoke inhalation .

"A British prisoner’s secret diary telling an epic story of love, survival and adultery in a Second World War internment camp has been discovered and returned to his daughter nearly 70 years after it was thought to have been destroyed. Civil servant Raymond Jones risked death by keeping a meticulous record of daily life in Hong Kong’s Stanley Camp where some 2,800 mostly British civilians were held from 1942 until 1945 after Japan invaded the former colony. The neat pencil strokes of newly married Jones, whose pregnant wife Marjorie was evacuated as Japanese troops closed in on Hong Kong, detail the war’s progress, the struggle to survive inside the brutal camp – and a passionate affair he had with a fellow internee. Memento: The only surviving wedding photograph of Raymond Jones and wife Marjorie . Throughout the war, Raymond, from Skegness, Lincolnshire, bravely kept a Union Jack hidden inside his mattress and was hailed a hero when he was allowed to hoist it above Stanley Camp watched by Allied troops and hundreds of fellow camp survivors following the Japanese surrender. Then, soon after he arrived home in Britain at the end of the war to join Marjorie and daughter Rae, a parcel arrived from his lover –  a nurse called Gwen Flower – with a letter telling besotted Raymond to forget about her and begin a new life with his family. But it was Marjorie who opened the letter and then read the diary. Heartbroken and angry, she tore up their wedding photos and the letters they had exchanged during the war and ordered Raymond to destroy the diary. Flag day: Raymond Jones proudly hoisting the Union Jack he kept stitched inside his mattress at the Stanley Camp when it was liberated after the Japanese surrender . Their marriage survived and – although Raymond pined for his lover – they returned to Hong Kong where they had a second daughter, Diana, and Raymond worked until 1957 when he was  diagnosed with cancer and returned to Britain where he died. Marjorie lived until 1985 and went to her grave telling her daughters her greatest regret was destroying the diary, which provided a unique record of life as a civilian war prisoner. But now, in a remarkable twist,  the diary has been returned to Raymond’s daughter, Rae Shaw, a 72-year-old grandmother. It was discovered in Scotland in 2010 by Alison McEwan, the daughter of another Hong Kong civil  servant, as she sorted through papers and books left by her father, who died in the mid-1980s. Alison recognised its significance and tried to trace Rae, who is mentioned  lovingly throughout. When she failed to find her, she sent the diary to Hong Kong where it was put on display in a museum on the site of the former prison camp. Rae learned of the diary’s existence when she was playing with a new iPad her grandson had helped her buy. She entered her name and ‘Hong Kong’ into an internet search engine to see if there was any record of her childhood in the Far East. It was then she saw a reference to the R. E. Jones War Diary in Hong Kong. The letter ‘E’ refers to Raymond’s middle name, Eric. When stunned Rae got in touch with the museum, the authorities copied the pages for display, released the original and sent it to Rae’s home in Nottingham. ‘I just tapped ‘‘Rae Marjorie Jones Hong Kong’’ on my iPad and up popped this list – and at the top of it were the words ‘‘R. E. Jones War Diary’’,’ explained Rae, a widow. ‘I shall never forget that moment. I froze. It was a feeling of shock – pure shock. And everything that has happened since has been so emotional and exciting and wonderful. How the diary survived the row between Raymond and Marjorie is  a mystery. ‘My mother described the destruction of the diary as her biggest regret. That is what we have lived with since,’ Rae said. Wartime record:The diary kept by Raymond Jones detailing everyday life in Stanley Camp . ‘After the war, Gwen sent my father a parcel containing an atlas, which I still have. My mother opened the parcel, and it contained this ‘‘Dear John’’ letter which she read. She was totally shocked and horrified and heartbroken. ‘They had this massive row where she ripped up all their wedding photographs and all the letters that had passed between them during the war. Mummy said everything was destroyed, including the diary. ‘I was only five at the time and I don’t remember the argument. I can only envisage a huge row. I imagine my father said, ‘‘I’ll go and burn the bloody thing,’’ and went off with the diary, but didn’t burn it and she just assumed he had.’ Rae believes her father secretly sent the diary to Alison’s father, Colin McEwan – who, like Raymond, served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in Hong Kong – or gave it to a fellow internee who later passed it to McEwan. ‘My father never once mentioned the diary and he obviously never mentioned it to my mother to spare her any more misery,’ she said. The diary – by turns fascinating, mundane and mildly scandalous – records the daily hardships, deaths and the price of black-market goods inside the prison camp. It also tells of rumours that were circulating about the war’s progress in Europe and the Pacific. Raymond writes lovingly of Marjorie and daughter Rae, particularly on their birthdays and at Christmas, before his romance with Gwen – referred to as G – blossoms in the dying months  of the war, leaving him torn between family life and his lover as he  heads home. Joyous day: Stanley Camp, which held mostly British civilians from 1942 to 1945 . In a touching entry for January 22, 1942, he writes, clearly with his wife in mind: ‘Well darling, our Rae is 12 months old and I sincerely hope and pray that this, her first birthday, will be the first and last that we are parted until she leaves us to start a home of her own. I hope you had a nice little party sweetheart, with one candle on the cake. God bless you both.’ But the horrors of war are never far from his mind. On July 13, 1942, he says: ‘Canton bombed last night. Hong Kong blockaded.’ And in another entry a year later, he describes the dreadful conditions in the camp: ‘Joint protest being signed by all adult internees. It deals with all the problems that are becoming more acute daily: poor food, lack of drugs and medicines; the increase of diseases caused through malnutrition; the inadequacy of canteen supplies and money.’ During Raymond’s time in the prison camp, seven internees were tortured in front of fellow prisoners and later executed for possessing a radio set they used to pass messages in and out of the camp. Many other prisoners died of illnesses linked to malnutrition. Surrender: General Douglas MacArthur, left, and Lt. Gen. Richard K. Sutherland, centre, watching Japanese Foreign Minister Manoru Shigemitsu marking Japan's formal surrender to Alllied forces on September 2, 1945 . After the Japanese surrender,  Rae lived with the painful fallout of the affair for the remainder of her otherwise idyllic childhood growing up in Hong Kong. A gregarious character before the war, Raymond was morose and withdrawn afterwards. She said: ‘As I was growing up, my mother would say, ‘‘Darling, he wasn’t always like this,’’ ’ said Rae. ‘People who knew him before the war say he was a charming, witty, loving man, but that is completely the opposite of the man I knew. ‘He was difficult. Everything I did he picked on. I had a hard time, and I assumed it was because the lady that ended the affair had said to him, ‘‘You must stay with your wife and get to know the baby you have never met.’’ ’ Rae draws comfort from the many loving references to her mother  and herself in the dairy. ‘You can see he was a very loving husband. He missed my mother terribly. He wrote to her regularly and, when I was born, he was thrilled,’ Rae said. ‘He calls mum Darling Marj and me Baby Rae and on my birthday he talks about me. So it tells me that  he was a normal, young married man, and that he changed.’ The war in Hong Kong: British troops being made to march during a Chinese victory parade . Younger sister Diana, who was just six when her father died, said: ‘Mummy regretted destroying the letters and wedding photographs but she was clearly heartbroken at the time. She would be delighted that the diary survived. ‘Mummy said if she could have  the time over again, she would do exactly the same – she clearly loved him very much.’ Despite the rift her affair with Raymond triggered, Rae and her  sister are keen to trace the family of Gwen Flower. ‘Diana and I wonder where she is,’ she said. ‘Because of what she did, our lives have been different to what they would otherwise have been. We wish we knew what happened to her, and we hope she found happiness.’","Raymond Jones kept a diary of daily life in Hong Kong PoW Camp in WW2 .

"Scotland Yard is investigating  a suspected arson attack that took place at the Houses of Parliament, The Mail on Sunday has discovered. Detectives believe a fire that broke out close to offices in the southern end of the House of Lords may have been started deliberately. They are also looking at a series of other incidents involving damage to computers during the recess, when most MPs are away on holiday. Scotland Yard is investigating a suspected arson attack at Westminster which is believed to taken place in the House of Lords . The investigation has prompted fears that a vengeful employee may be waging a campaign of criminal damage. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police are investigating other incidents of damage in the same building, but are yet to determine  if these are linked to the fire.’ Last summer a small blaze broke out in the House of Commons, closing areas of the Parliament temporarily. Sources said at the time there was no significant . damage but areas were being cordoned off because of the potential danger . from toxic substances such as asbestos. In March Labour leader Ed Miliband was left shaken after his House of Commons office was mysteriously broken into.

"Dangerous: Shaun Tudor has been jailed indefinitely for the attempted rape and sexual assault of a ten-year-old boy in Rainworth, Nottinghamshire . A convicted sex offender attacked a ten-year-old boy just minutes after being allowed to walk out of his secure unit unsupervised. Shaun Tudor, who has spent 23 years in psychiatric institutions, was granted unescorted leave even though he had a history of attacking boys – and once did so while on leave from another unit. In his latest attack, Tudor dragged his terrified victim into some bushes within ten minutes of being let out. The 43-year-old, who completed two spells totalling seven years at high-security mental institution Rampton, then sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the boy. Yesterday, at Nottingham Crown Court, Tudor was jailed indefinitely over the attack, in Rainworth, Nottinghamshire. The court heard that it had left the family of Tudor’s victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in ‘turmoil’, and forced them to leave the area. After sentencing, the family’s solicitor, Martin Lee, said: ‘They feel terribly let down by the system that allowed Tudor to be placed at this unit in a residential area. And they have other questions. Why was Tudor, with his record, allowed out of the unit unaccompanied?’ Tudor struck on a ‘sunny afternoon’ last July, the court heard. Tudor told the two . boys he was 'looking at nature' then pretended to fall over. When the victim . went to help him up, he grabbed him and carried him off into bushes and . carried out sex attack . His victim was playing with a friend in woods 250 yards from his home. After being released from the nearby . St Andrew’s Healthcare Centre on a two-hour leave of absence, Tudor . spotted the boys and told them he was ‘looking at nature’. He then . pretended to fall over, and when his victim went to help him up, Tudor . grabbed him and carried him into bushes, out of the sight of his friend. There, Tudor attacked the boy, before threatening to ‘track him down and kill him’ if he reported what had happened. The boy returned to his friend and initially didn’t say anything. Answers wanted: Tudor had been given unsupervised leave from the St Andrew's Healthcare Centre (pictured) in Mansfield when the attack took place . Predator: Tudor has spent his whole adult life in psychiatric units including two spells at maximum-security Rampton Hospital (pictured) in Nottinghamshire . But when he got home, he began sobbing and told his horrified mother, who called the police. Tudor was picked up eight hours . later, around five miles away. After his arrest, he told officers: ‘I’ve . been doing so well for the last 24 years.’ Tudor had indecently assaulted young . boys on two previous occasions – in 1984, when he was just 16, and then . again four years later. Tudor was convicted of indecent . assault over the second attack, on a seven-year-old boy, which happened . while he was on weekend leave from a psychiatric hospital in Birmingham. Warning: A judge told Tudor at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) that he would serve at least four years and 10 months before being considered for release, but said it was unlikely he would be freed . Tudor first came to the attention of the authorities in 1984 at the age of 16 when he was given a care order for indecently assaulting a six-year-old boy, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Four years later, he launched a horrific attack on a seven-year-old boy while on weekend leave while being treated at a psychiatric hospital in Birmingham. The court heard he approached the youngster, who was on a bike, and marched him down to a river where he ordered him to remove his trousers. But when the frightened boy soiled himself, Tudor became angry and held his head under water while striking him with a rock. He was convicted of indecent assault and given his first hospital order. Since then, Tudor has never been free, spending his entire adult life in different psychiatric hospitals across the UK. He was in Rampton from 1988 to 1995, returning for a second spell in 1998. Tudor was moved to St Andrew's in Nottinghamshire from a low security unit in Northamptonshire when it was reclassified as a 'locked unit'. Steven Taylor, mitigating, said his 'grading risk had gone up and down under different regimes' over the years. He added: 'His preference clearly is for young boys and he was unable to control himself on this latest occasion. 'He probably convinced himself that he would be able to manage in the community.' He was sent to Rampton, the high . security mental institution which has treated ‘Angel of Death’ nurse . Beverley Allitt, Soham murderer Ian Huntley and serial killer Mark . Rowntree. He was there until 1995, returning for a spell in 1998. The court heard Tudor had been moved . to the medium-to-low security St Andrew’s Centre eight months before his . latest attack. It was also told that in a pre-sentence report, Tudor . said: ‘I will definitely reoffend against children if I am released into . the community.’ Steven Taylor, defending, said that . Tudor ‘plainly was not safe to be out on unescorted leave’, and that . ‘someone at St Andrew’s had taken a chance’. But Judge John Burgess said he . believed there was an ‘element of deviousness’ about how Tudor answered . questions which allowed him to be granted leave, and that he ‘appeared . to have learned what to say to impress’. Judge Burgess said he was imposing a . jail term, instead of the hospital orders Tudor had been subject to in . the past, because ‘everything had been tried and not worked’. He handed Tudor, who admitted . attempted rape and sexual assault, an indeterminate sentence for public . protection with a recommendation he serve at least four years and ten . months before being considered for release. In reality, the judge said, it was unlikely he would ever be freed. A spokesman for St Andrew’s . Healthcare, a not-for-profit mental health charity, said: ‘St Andrew’s . wants to reassure the community of its commitment to good practice and . that an incident of this type is exceptionally rare.’ He said the decision to allow Tudor . unescorted leave was ‘clinically appropriate, based on the information . available at the time’. Detective Inspector Caroline Racher, . of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘We...have been working with the . management at St Andrew’s to ensure there can be no repetition of such a . terrible incident.’","Shaun Tudor, 43, sexually assaulted and tried to rape victim .

"Few dare to mess with Freya, the Chancellor’s cat with an impressive reputation for mouse-catching. She has gained the upper hand in a dawn catfight with his neighbour Larry, the Prime Minister’s cat who is better known for ‘chillaxing’. But it appears the latest addition to George Osborne’s menagerie at Number 11 might be winning a new power struggle at Downing Street. 'Showdown on Downing Street': Freya the cat stands her ground against new addition Lola . Over the weekend, the Chancellor posted a photograph which he had taken of Lola, his new puppy, and Freya, his old moggy, on Twitter. The caption read simply: ‘Showdown at Downing Street.’ While Freya cowers under the table, Lola - a Bichon Frise puppy who is only a few months old - is looking on inquisitively. Last night, Downing Street insiders insisted the pair are good friends despite the traditionally dysfunctional relationship between cats and dogs. He insisted: ‘Freya is not aggressive. She is lovely. She is just a bit more efficient than Larry when it comes to mouse-catching.’ David Cameron looks as though he was struggling a little during a jog this weekend . Mr Osborne also has a budgie called Gibson, named after Guy Gibson, who led 617 Squadron on the Dam Busters raid, and two goldfish, whose names are not known. Freya has emerged from a troubled past. She was bought by the Chancellor and his wife, Frances, for their two children in 2009, initially living with them at their home in Notting Hill, west London. She went missing, but was eventually returned after being found by a former neighbour who was helped by a microchip under the cat’s skin carrying Mrs Osborne’s phone number. But in Downing street suspicion was rife that Freya may have been carrying other electronic devices in order to infiltrate the heart of government and the Treasury. A Tory source said at the time ‘Some of us think the Chinese got her. She can get everywhere. ‘You’d only have to bug her and you could find out half the Government’s secrets.’ Lola is believed to be the first dog to inhabit Downing Street since Harold Wilson was prime minister in the 1960s and brought his yellow labrador Paddy with him. The stand off comes as David Cameron was feeling the strain as he pounded the streets of Westminster in his jogging gear. He tries to go for a twice-weekly jog in the parks near Downing Street, at ‘strange times of the day’ so as not to attract attention. The Prime Minister said in a radio interview last week he was never recognised by tourists who thought he was just another ‘middle aged slightly overweight man’ as he trotted past. Despite his regular runs, he has admitted his age is starting to ‘creep up on him’ when it comes to more strenuous exercise. He has not followed in the footsteps of Nick Clegg, who recently told how he had taken up kickboxing to keep his weight down.","Osborne posted dramatic picture on Twitter of family puppy and cat .

"Found dead: Former News of the World journalist Sean Hoare was discovered at his home in Watford . The man who launched the entire phone hacking scandal had become a paranoid recluse who believed someone was out to get him, a friend has revealed. Sean Hoare, who was found dead at his flat in Watford, Hertfordshire, had spent much of the last weeks of his life 'hiding' in his flat with the curtains drawn. A post mortem examination revealed that there was no third party involvement in the death. Officers are not treating the death as suspicious although it will be several weeks before they have full toxicology results. A friend and neighbour . claimed Mr Hoare, 47, had become increasingly reclusive and paranoid in . recent weeks. ‘He would talk about someone from the Government coming to . get him,' he said. 'He’d say to me, “If anyone comes by, don’t say I’m in”. 'He was physically going downhill. He was yellow in colour and wasn’t looking well for the last month. ‘He had a constant struggle with alcohol and talked to me about how much he had put his wife through. ‘He . did say something about phone hacking and I think that was his main . worry. He had definite concerns with the media. He did mention he was . paranoid and would mention conspiracy stuff.’ Former News of the World journalist Mr Hoare had accused former Tory media chief Andy Coulson of lying about his role in the affair. He said that when editor of the paper, Mr Coulson actively encouraged his staff to intercept the calls of celebrities. It was his explosive claims last . autumn that reignited the scandal and ultimately led to the tumultuous . events of the past fortnight which have shaken the political, police and . media establishments. Police were investigating the possibility that he had killed himself, saying his death was ‘not thought to be suspicious’. His death came after: . Mr Hoare in the sitting room of his home. A friend and neighbour claimed Mr Hoare had become increasingly reclusive and paranoid in recent weeks . Tragic: Police are investigating the death of Mr Hoare after his body was found at his Hertfordshire home . The body of Mr Hoare, 47, was discovered by police on Monday morning at his modern first-floor flat in Watford. The . former reporter blew the whistle during an investigation by the New . York Times last September, pointing the finger directly at Mr Coulson, . by then the Prime Minister’s communications chief. Until Mr Hoare spoke out in . September, pressure had eased on Mr Coulson, recruited by David Cameron . as his media chief in 2007 after resigning as editor of the News of the . World when royal reporter Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn . Mulcaire were jailed. Last . week, Mr Hoare was back in the spotlight with further claims, telling . the New York Times that reporters at the News of the World were able to . use police technology to locate people using their mobile phone signals . in exchange for payments to police officers. Mr Coulson, who quit Downing Street . in January and was arrested over hacking earlier this month, has . strenuously denied Mr Hoare’s allegations. Allegations: Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was aware phone hacking took place at the paper, Mr Hoare claimed last year . Last year Mr Hoare (right) claimed that Andy Coulson was aware of phone hacking while he was editor at the News of the World. He gave an interview to the New York Times, and then to the BBC, about the use of phone hacking at the newspaper. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said phone hacking was 'endemic' in the newspaper industry. Mr Hoare, who worked on the Sun before being recruited by Mr Coulson to work on the NOTW, said: 'He was well aware that the practice exists. To deny it is a lie, simply a lie.' Mr Coulson denies the allegations. Later, Mr Hoare was interviewed by police over the allegations he had made but would offer no comment, Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said in December. He . issued a statement last year that he had ‘never condoned the use of . phone hacking and nor do I have any recollection of incidences where . phone hacking took place’. But Mr Hoare told Radio 4’s PM programme . that phone hacking was ‘endemic’ at the newspaper and said of his . former boss: ‘He was well aware that the practice exists. To deny it is a . lie, simply a lie.’ Police could not rule out suicide but friends suggested natural causes was also a possibility as he had been suffering from ill health. A Hertfordshire Police spokeswoman added: 'The man's next of kin have been informed and the family are being supported by police at this sad time.' Officers have yet to confirm arrangements for an inquest to be opened. His solicitor David Sonn said: ‘I last spoke to him a week ago and he seemed fine. I am shocked and saddened. It is a terrible tragedy.’ He added: ‘In giving his statement to the New York Times, he was arguably the catalyst for everything that has happened since.’  When Mr Coulson was made editor of the News of the World in 2003, he recruited Mr Hoare as a showbusiness reporter. Investigation: Forensic officers and a policeman at the flat of Mr Hoare . They had previously both worked on The Sun’s showbusiness column Bizarre. One . former colleague said: ‘At The Sun, they were absolutely the best of . buddies. They used to go out to Covent Garden and socialise all night . together. Andy would cover for Sean, or vice versa, if one of them was . too hung over for work. ‘I last saw Sean at a do not all that . long after he left the News of the World. He was looking very scrubbed . and sober and I asked what he planned to do, and he said he wanted to . get back into journalism but added, “Journalism has turned its back on . me”.’ Mr Hoare was sacked . from the News of the World over drink and drug problems in 2005, and . last year sources at the paper said that his claims should be treated . with ‘extreme scepticism’. But a friend who saw him more recently described him as ‘sober’ and wanting to rebuild his career. Evidence: The death of Mr Hoare is currently being treated as unexplained, said authorities .

Police recovered a bag containing a computer, phone and paperwork found in a bin near Rebekah Brooks’s London home."
"Police were yesterday given a bag containing a computer, phone and paperwork found in a bin near the London home of Rebekah Brooks. Someone handed the items to security guards at the Chelsea Harbour complex of luxury apartments where she owns a £1.5million property. It is understood that Mrs Brooks’s husband Charlie tried to reclaim them, but could not prove they were his – and the guards called police instead. Charlie and Rebekah Brooks. It is understood that Charlie tried to reclaim the computer and phone, but could not prove they were his - and the guards called police instead . The bag was found in an underground car park in the Design Centre of the development on Monday afternoon. The car park is under a shopping . centre just yards from the gated apartment block where Mrs Brooks . purchased a penthouse flat overlooking the River Thames in 2008. She shares it with her husband Charlie Brooks, a former racehorse trainer and close friend of the Prime Minister David Cameron. One source at the harbour complex . said the bag was handed to security at around 3pm, and that shortly . afterwards, Mr Brooks tried to reclaim it. Detectives are now examining footage from CCTV cameras in the car park to discover who dropped the bag. Mr Brooks’s spokesman denied the bag belonged to Mrs Brooks. ‘Charlie has a bag which contains a laptop and papers which were private to him,’ he said. ‘They were nothing to do with Rebekah or the [phone-hacking] case.’ Luxury: The items were discovered in a car park close to the Chelsea Harbour Complex where the Brooks have a £1.5m apartment . He said Mr Brooks had left the bag with a friend who was returning it, but dropped it in the wrong part of the garage. When asked how the bag ended up in a bin he replied: ‘The suggestion is that a cleaner thought it was rubbish and put it in the bin.’ ‘Charlie was told it had gone to security, by which stage they .

"PR puss: The Camerons are said to be annoyed that people see the cat as something of a gimmick . David Cameron tonight addressed the nation on the big political issue of the day: does he hate Larry the Cat. According to a new book, the claws are out for the pet hired to catch mice in the corridors of power. But in the midst of a growing political storm and a Twitter campaign to ’Save Larry’, even the Prime Minister had to resort to a pun, insisting they all get on ’purr-fectly well’. Mr Cameron initially ruled out getting a cat to deal with the rat problem in Downing Street. But under pressure from those around him, including his children, he relented in February 2011 and Larry was found at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. A new book lifting the lid on the tensions which dominate the coalition claim it is not just pesky Lib Dems which Mr Cameron is fed up with. Matthew d’Ancona suggests in the book, In It Together, that the Camerons ’do not like the Downing Street cat, Larry, amid suggestions that the pet is a PR prop’. As fur flew, the revelation sparked a Twitter storm using the hashtag #savelarry. In an attempt to quell the row, Mr Cameron took to Twitter tonight to insist: ’I can set everyone's mind at rest in the #SaveLarry campaign. ’He and I get on purr-fectly well. The kids love him too.’ David Cameron took to Twitter in a bid to quell the row over Larry the Cat . Staying power: The Camerons came to office in . 2005 (left) and Larry arrived in 2011, but the bookies' odds are on the . cat outlasting the Tory leader . Mr Cameron may have been spooked by comparisons with the Blairs, who famously ousted Downing Street cat Humphrey within weeks of New Labour coming to office, with speculation rife about a rift with Cherie. However concerns about Larry first emerged two years ago. Mr Cameron in particular grew fed up with his suit getting covered in hair, while visitors to the Prime Minister’s official residence were met with the smell of cat food badly disguised by cheap air freshener. However, Larry’s preference for catnapping over rat catching has long been a cause for concern. It took more than a year before he secured his first kill, drawing comparisons with Mr Cameron’s love of ’chillaxing’. Mousy: The Camerons were said to be disappointed with Larry's performance as a rat-catcher - the job for which he was intended . David Cameron, pictured arriving at the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, has sought to dispel rumours over Larry's future . He was appointed Chief Mouser to the Cabinet soon after arriving in Downing Street but failed to deal with the rodent problem. He was then the victim of a reshuffle, after Mr Cameron admitted Larry was a ‘terrible mouser’. Freya, a cat belonging to George Osborne who lives next door at Number 11 was given the title. Relations have been fraught since, including the two being pictured fighting on the steps of Number 10 in October last year.

"David Cameron has promised to abolish a helpline set up by the Environment Agency for flood victims which charges a premium rate of up to 41p a minute for calls. After the high cost of dialling the helpline came to light yesterday, the Prime Minister’s spokesman said the 0845 number would be phased out later this year. The Floodline number costs 10.5p a minute from landlines and could be as much as 41p from a mobile. The aim of the service is to give details of flood warnings and advice. The Environment Agency had claimed the 0845 prefix was used because there was no other number available. Bad weather: Flood victims are being forced to pay up to 41p-a-minute to call a premium rate government helpline . A Hampshire Police car had to be rescued from floodwaters in Derritt Lane near Bransgore today after stalling on the flooded road . Shocking: According to the Environment Agency's website, although there is a freephone number for reporting incidents, anyone needing help or advice must pay a premium rate . However, . yesterday amid the outcry, it set up an alternative helpline on a . cheaper 0345 number, which costs the same as calling a landline. The . Government has come under repeated criticism for choosing the expensive . O845 numbers for helplines. Mr Cameron also played down the suggestion . from Environment Agency boss Lord Smith that only ‘town or country’ could be protected from flooding, because it is difficult to do both . without a ‘bottomless’ budget. But . Lord Smith – whose officials have been criticised for failing to dredge . rivers – added that he ‘regretted’ that ‘we probably have not done as . much as we should have’. The cheaper new Floodline number - 0345 9881188 - has since been released and will operate alongside the existing  0845 number to ensure that people with the old number are still able to get through. But the PM's spokesman insisted it would be axed 'as soon as it can be done'. However David Rooke, director of flood and coastal risk management at the EA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We don't make any money out of that. We have plans in place to switch. What we are doing is developing a communications plan, because clearly that number has been in use for some years. People have got used to it and they know what number to ring. 'So there is a plan being developed, has been for some time now, to switch over and we think summer is probably the best time to switch rather than... the winter period.' The phone line offers up to date flood warnings and tips to protect people and homes from water. 'In a flood it's important to focus on the safety of you and your family,' one says. 'Wear waterproof clothing, boots and gloves. Go upstairs. Take food, . water, a torch and any essential medication. Evacuate if told to do so. Clean and disinfect your property using household cleaners'. No let up: Flooding in the village of Yalding, Kent, which has been submerged with flood water . The news comes as the chairman of the Environment Agency said Britain may have to choose whether it . wants to save 'town or country' from future flooding because it is too . costly to defend both. Bryony . Sadler, a member of Somerset's Flooding on the Levels Action Group, told The Sun: 'It is shocking that hard-pressed flood victims are being charged for this. 'We are extremely grateful to the Environment Agency's people on the ground, who are doing their best to help us. 'But this is just another example of staggering mismanagement from their pen-pushing bosses'. Another victim said: 'These people are victims of some of the worst flooding this country has ever seen and are struggling to pay their bills. 'Yet when they need help, they have to pay again. It is disgusting and should be changed to a free number immediately.' Brave: A cyclist on a flooded cycle path by the River Avon and Cumberland Road didn't let flooding put him off getting on his bike . The premium phone line controversy emerged as the chairman . of the Environment Agency said 'difficult choices' would have to be . made over what to protect from future flooding because 'there is no . bottomless purse' to pay for defences. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Smith said that 'there are no quick fixes in the face of this kind of extreme rainfall', and tough decisions lie ahead about how protection from flooding is managed in the future. He added: 'Yes, agricultural land matters and we do whatever we can with what we have to make sure it is protected. Rules from successive governments give the highest priority to lives and homes; and I think most people would agree that this is the right approach. 'But this involves tricky issues of policy and priority; town or country, front rooms or farmland?' Surfers wait to attempt to ride a rare maximum five star Severn Bore at the Severn Bore Inn besides the River Severn yesterday . Children play in flood water blocking the main A361 at Burrow Bridge near Langport in Somerset yesterday . Following a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergencies committee yesterday, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said that 73,000 homes in England had been protected from flooding since Friday, and that the EA continued to protect communities by deploying demountable flood defences, sandbags and clearing waterways. He said: 'I have enormous sympathy for those who have been affected again this weekend and the government is working with all local councils to help communities recover. All requests for assistance have been met.' Meanwhile householders have been told . to brace themselves as further wind and rain threatens to bring more . chaos to waterlogged communities across Britain. Around . 180 homes were flooded during a busy weekend for the emergency . services and Environment Agency workers up and down the country. But as flood-hit communities enjoyed a break in the bad weather yesterday, forecasters warned there may be worse to come, with winds of up to 70mph and up to 30mm of rain expected today. Further . flooding is expected this week as high sea levels, strong winds and . large waves continue to wreak havoc in coastal regions. And it emerged . yesterday that households and businesses across the Somerset Levels that . are cut off by flood water are now in the midst of a crime wave. Opportunistic thieves are targeting evacuated homes and workplaces, stealing possessions and then escaping by boat. Looters . stole 600 gallons of oil from one farmer and two quad-bikes used by the . fire service.

"James Attfield, who was found with more than 100 stab wounds, was described as 'shy and polite' by his family . Detectives are hunting a frenzied . killer who stabbed a vulnerable father-of-five more than a hundred times . in a town centre park. Former . barman James Attfield, described as 'shy and polite' by his family, . suffered so many injuries it took eight and a half hours to carry out a . postmortem. The 33 . year-old, who had never fully recovered from a car accident four years . ago, had multiple wounds to his hands, chest, back, neck and head. His grieving mother said Mr. Attfield avoided crowded places and potential trouble spots and preferred a quiet life. His mutilated body was found at dawn on Saturday in Lower Castle Park in Colchester, Essex. He was last seen alive dinking alone in the nearby River Lodge pub where he sat at the bar for more than four hours. Detective chief inspector Simon Werret, who has been with Essex Police for 27 years, said the murder was the most brutal he had ever seen. He said: 'This was a violent, frenzied attack on a vulnerable man. He had wounds on his arms, hands, back, neck and head.' Mr. Attfield's mother Julie Finch, of Coggeshall, Essex, said: 'James was known as Jim to his family and was always shy and polite. 'Four years ago Jim was involved in a car accident which left him with a brain injury and caused the left side of his body to be weak. The injury affected his reasoning and speech. Final moments: Police have released these CCTV images of Mr Attfield drinking alone in the River Lodge pub . Investigators say the Mr Attfield spent more than four hours in the bar which is close to where his body was found . Officers say Mr Attfield left at 10.09pm leaving three quarters of a pint behind, described as 'unusual' 'Jim had always preferred going for a . drink in a quiet 'old man's pub' rather than clubbing and never had many . friends his own age. 'After . the accident he was vulnerable and did not like going to crowded places . as he knew he needed to keep away from trouble to avoid any risks which . could lead to further injury. 'Jim was never the type of person to look for a fight and would always back down or walk away. 'Even after his accident he was always smiling and continuously challenging himself. He wanted to be the best he could be and always pushed himself to assist his recovery. 'Jim was loved by all his family and will be missed. Jim was a son, brother and father. My family and I would like to be given the space we need to grieve in private.' Police are still searching for the murder weapon and are appealing for witnesses. Castle Park in Colchester, where Mr Attfield was killed. Police are appealing for information on the incident . DCI Werret added: 'Jim was last seen in the River Lodge pub in Middleborough,Colchester on Friday night. 'He left the pub at 10.09pm, leaving almost three quarters of a pint behind, which is believed to be unusual. 'We do not know where he went between leaving the pub and being found injured in Castle Park at 5.45am on Saturday morning. 'Castle Park is used at all hours of the day and night and I'm sure someone will have seen something. Mr Attfield was known for enjoying a quiet life and avoiding conflict . 'Jim was not a confrontational person and would actively avoid risky situations and crowds due to his previous brain injury following a car accident four years ago. 'Jim did not have many friends and would drink alone. We still have no motive or suspect and no weapon has been recovered. 'Whoever was responsible would have come home with blood on clothing and possibly be injured themselves. If this is someone you know please call. 'Has anyone noticed a knife missing from their knife block? I would also ask people who live in the vicinity of the scene to check their gardens to see if a knife may have been discarded there.' The detective added that Mr Attfield regularly visited the park and it was one of many routes the father-of-five could have taken to get home. They said he had been living in a bedsit as a result of the accident, but refused to discuss his car accident. They also refused to be drawn on his mental state saying his movements on the night of his death were 'normal routine'. DCI Werrett refused to confirm whether Mr Attfield was still in possession of his wallet or phone when he was found by a member of the public. Police have mounted extra patrols in the area and warned people to stay vigilant as the killer remains at large. Superintendent Steve Ditchburn added: 'We remain concerned that we have not yet been able to trace the person or people responsible for this death. 'I would ask people to remain vigilant and to contact us if they see anything suspicious.'

"New move: David Cameron has backed up his promotion of marriage by introducing a tax break for couples . David Cameron has shown his support for same-sex couples by taking to Twitter to announce gay partners will benefit from new marriage tax breaks. The Prime Minister has announced plans for married couples to receive a £1,000 tax allowance in recognition of their ‘commitment and responsibility’. The tax break will be available to gay couples in civil partnerships and – following a change in the law – in marriages. Taking to Twitter, Mr Cameron wrote: 'The £1000 marriage tax allowance will apply to straight and gay couples, as well as civil partners. Love is love, commitment is commitment.' In an article for the Daily Mail, the Prime Minister says the transferable allowance will be introduced in 2015. Stay-at-home mothers and women who work part time will be the main winners. ‘The values of marriage are give and take, support and sacrifice – values that we need more of,’ Mr Cameron writes. ‘Marriage is a good thing for our country – it’s the ultimate form of commitment under the law – and we want to show our support for it.’ The move, first promised by the Prime Minister when he ran for the Tory leadership in 2005, restores the financial recognition for marriage lost when a similar allowance was phased out in 1999. Under Mr Cameron’s plans, which he will champion at his party conference next week, a husband or wife will be allowed to transfer £1,000 of their tax-free personal allowance to their spouse. Support: Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his backing for same-sex couples to be included in new marriage tax breaks . The Tory 2010 election manifesto promised a figure of only £750. It will apply to those not using all of their personal allowance – either because they are at home looking after children, or work part time and earn less than £10,000. Around eight million people are expected to benefit  – by around £200 a year. The Liberal Democrats, who object to any special recognition for marriage, will abstain in a vote on the issue, a provision included in the 2010 coalition agreement. But even if, as expected, Labour opposes the measure it should pass thanks to the votes of Conservative MPs. It will be confirmed in Chancellor George Osborne’s autumn statement and introduced from April 2015 – making it a key issue at the general election a few weeks later. Happy memories: David Cameron, pictured on his wedding day with Samantha, has stuck to his principles and rewarded married couples . The tax break will not be available to couples that have a higher rate taxpayer which, in 2015, will be those earning more than £42,285. Mr Cameron’s decision to press ahead will delight most Conservative MPs and polls suggest the move is supported by around two thirds of voters. The Tories argue that, for 11 years, Labour undermined marriage and financially punished couples where one spouse chooses to stay at home to bring up a family. The US, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark and Norway are among nations that reward the caring role of stay-at-home spouses. However, the tax measure, expected to cost around £600million a year, will provoke controversy at a time of austerity. It had been put on hold because of the efforts to rein in state spending, and the priority given to the Coalition’s goal of increasing the personal tax allowance for 24million basic rate taxpayers to £10,000 a year. But Right-wing Tories, including several members of the Cabinet, indicated they wanted action quickly. The measure may help placate social conservatives uneasy at the Government’s focus on introducing gay marriage, as well as the removal of child benefit from high earners. Mr Osborne has also promised childcare tax breaks after 2015 to help working women – leading Right-wing Tories to insist it is right for the Government to show support for stay-at-home mothers as well. Tim Loughton, a Tory former minister who campaigned for the tax break, said: ‘The Government is sending out a very strong signal that marriage and the commitment it demonstrates is good for families, children and society, both socially and financially, and we should not be afraid to stand up for it.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has branded the idea ‘odd’, while Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has complained widows and those abandoned by their partners will be excluded. Happy? Married couples will be praying the new tax break gets passed through government (posed by models) Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who has driven the party’s policy on backing for marriage, initially proposed a larger tax break costing £3.2billion a year. But he agreed there should be a staggered introduction of tax allowances because of the catastrophic state of the public finances. In 1999, its final year before it was abolished for all but pensioner couples, the married couples allowance was worth £197 a year. Marriage is already recognised in both inheritance tax and capital gains tax. For more than 20 years, the Daily Mail has led calls for marriage to be recognised in the tax system once more. Alongside the birth of my children, . my wedding was the happiest day of my life. Since then, Samantha and I . have been a team. Nothing I’ve done since – becoming a Member of . Parliament, leader of my party or Prime Minister – would have been . possible without her. There . is something special about marriage: it’s a declaration of commitment, . responsibility and stability that helps to bind families. The values of . marriage are give and take, support and sacrifice – values that we need . more of in this country. Of . course, governments can’t be in the business of social engineering – . there is nothing more scary than the prospect of a politician trying to . do so. And naturally, there are people across the country who have never  married and are just as committed to each other. Team: David Cameron credits much of his success at No.10 to his wife Samantha . We . also know that sadly too many marriages come to an end. But surely we . can agree with all these things, yet at the same time support something . which we know can help keep families together. There . is good evidence about the positive role that marriage can play: study . upon study has shown that families  with married couples are less likely . to break up. There are . also many studies about the cost of family breakdown. I am not for one . minute arguing that marriage is a panacea, of course it isn’t. But . the real question is this: because marriage is an institution that . helps to build a strong society, shouldn’t society properly recognise . that in the tax system? Other countries do – I think we should too. That’s . why when I ran for the leadership of my party back in 2005, I said that . I wanted to do more for marriage in the tax system: a personal pledge . that I made right at the start of my campaign – and I then backed that . up with a pledge in our manifesto at the last election. So next week at the Conservative Party’s conference in Manchester, I’m going to deliver on the promise I made. From . April 2015, if neither of you are higher rate taxpayers, you will be . able to transfer £1,000 of your tax-free allowance to your spouse. In . effect, if you pay the basic rate of tax and your partner doesn’t use . all of their personal allowance, you’ll be able to have some of it. Most . couples who benefit will be £200 a year better off as a result. And of course this will . be true if  you’re gay or straight – and in a civil partnership or a . marriage. This summer I was proud to make equal marriage the law. Love . is love, commitment is commitment. Proud: David Cameron believes there is something 'very special' about marriage, and that needs rewarding . I’m . really proud that we’re getting this done. But when you make an . important change like this, I know that people will have questions. What’s more, whenever you talk about the family as a politician, it’s all too easy for your opponents to twist your meaning. Labour . won’t miss a trick: they will spend the next week peddling false and . inaccurate myths rather than having a sensible debate. So . let’s address a few of the myths that are likely are to spring up. This . is not about stigmatising unmarried people or single parents:  as I’ve . already said, you don’t  have to be married to have a family life that . is rock solid – and we support all families through the tax and benefits . system. All we’re . saying is that marriage is a good thing for our country – it’s the . ultimate form of commitment under the law – and we want to show our . support for it. Next, the charge will . come  up that we’re trying to bribe people to get married. Frankly this . is  a pretty depressing – and wrong-headed – view of human nature. People aren’t going to choose to get married for a few extra pounds each . week. This policy  isn’t about the money but about the message that . people who  make a lasting commitment should be recognised in some way. Finally, Labour will say we’re favouring some families over others. But I’m happy to defend our record any day of the week. From . tax-free childcare for every working family to an income  tax cut for . 25million people – from cutting fuel duty to freezing council tax – . we’re doing something  for all families even in these difficult times. Compare this to the promises that Labour made to you last week – promises that fell apart within a matter of hours. From . tomorrow the Conservative Party will be gathering in Manchester. Together we’ll be speaking  to the nation with a clear message – we are . backing hard-working  people in this country every step of the way. Whether you’re young and hungry for your first job or a family tired of . renting and looking to own your first home, then the Conservative Party . will help you achieve your dreams. Supporting marriage is part of that vision for Britain, recognising an institution that is all about commitment. I’m proud that we’re finally making this happen – and proud that we’re delivering on the promise I made.","Prime Minister confirms marriage tax break will extend to same-sex couples .

"A Thai surrogate mother has vowed to care for the critically-ill baby she gave birth to before he was suddenly abandoned by his Australian parents. Pattharamon Janbua - the surrogate mother of the six-month-old boy with Down's syndrome - has had her hopes of a spirited survival for Gammy heightened in the days since he has been receiving treatment for a serious lung infection. Aided by an incredible fundraising effort for his medical costs, which now stands at more than $155,000, Ms Pattharamon said she wants to 'take care of Gammy' as her own. 'I won't give my baby to anybody,' she told Fairfax Media. Scroll down for video . Thai mother Pattharamon Janbua broke down after telling of her pain for baby Gammy . Ms Janbua said she loved the six-month-old boy like he was her own child . The Thai surrogate mother has received more than $182,000 in donations to care for Gammy after he was abandoned . Her Hopes of a spirited survival for the six-month-old comes after she had all but conceded on Friday that he would die because of his illness. Bangkok-based media outlet, the Thai Rath newspaper, reported Ms Janbua believed her son's death was unavoidable. She has been by his bedside as he battles a lung infection, according to the Thai Rath newspaper. 'I think the baby will not make it because his lung infection is too serious,' she told a Thai Rath reporter. The 21-year-old has two other children aged six and three, and scores of Australians have also offered to adopt the baby. The first two targets were $25,000 and $150,000 and were surpassed on Friday and Saturday. More than 2,712 people have donated in the three days since the Hope For Gammy page went live and the new target is set at $200,000. Ms Pattharamon said she 'did not expect' to see such a large donation of money pool in, and it has given her renewed hope after she was reduced to tears on Friday. The 21-year-old broke down when she spoke about how the baby she was paid to carry was was rejected by his Australian parents. She told of her pain for the child, saying she loved the baby boy like he was her own and her pain has motivated her to take care of him. The 21-year-old mother - who lives 90km south of Bangkok - had been paid a total of about $16,000 by the couple to give birth to the baby but when she gave birth to twins - a boy and a girl - they only took the girl back to Australia. Baby boy Gammy has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell . The surrogate mother, who already had two children of her own, was paid a total of about $16,000 to have the twins - a boy and a girl . The Thai woman - who lives 90km south of Bangkok - has as three-year-old girl and seven-year-old boy of her own . Ms Janbua - who already had two other children aged three and six - told the ABC she felt sorry for baby Gammy. 'This was the adults’ fault. And who is he to endure something like this even though it’s not his fault?' she said. 'Why does he have to be abandoned and the other baby has it easy? 'I chose to have him, not to hurt him.' Ms Janbua said she treated the six-month-old like he was one of her own children. 'I love him, he was in my tummy for nine months, it’s like my child,' she told the ABC. 'Never think that you’re not my child, that I don’t care for you.' This came after an online campaign set up for Gammy raised more than $50,000 after his heartbreaking story was shared. Baby boy Gammy has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell. The Australian couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Pattaramon to have an abortion . The couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Janbua to have an abortion when they found out four-months into the pregnancy that one of the babies had Down syndrome. 'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Janbua said, The Sydney Morning Herald reported earlier on Friday. The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Janbua was having twins for them. Ms Janbua is a Buddhist and thinks abortion is a 'sin'. She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency. The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves. Ms Jambua, from a village in Chon Buri province in southern Thailand, gave birth to Gammy and his twin sister in Bangok hospital. 'Because of the poverty and debts, the money that was offered was a lot for me,' she told the ABC. 'In my mind, with that money, we one could educate my children and two we can repay our debt.' However, when the babies were born the agent took the girl away and delivered her to the Australian couple who Ms Janbua has never met. She never received the remaining $2341 that she was owed by the agent and is now struggling to keep her baby alive. A Hope For Gammy campaign was set up on Go Fund Me and has been inundated by donations. The page pleads: '6 month old baby Gammy was born in Bangkok with down syndrome and a congenital heart condition. He was abandoned by his family and is being cared for by a young Thai woman who does not have the funds for his desperately needed medical treatment. 'Please make a donation so that he can have these operations and improve his quality of life. All monies raised will be kept in trust and will only be used for the care and wellbeing of Gammy.' Ms Pattaramon, 21, agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems . One doctor has donated $3,000 to the cause. An administrator for the page wrote: 'Dr Pisit of ALL IVF has made a very generous donation after hearing about the Gammy Story. No ALL IVF Center staff have ever been involved in the Gammy case, but are touched by his situation and wanted to help. Thank you very much.' Gammy's tragic story has caused outrage on Twitter. Richard Long wrote: 'Takes a bit to make me angry but this story does. what greedy, selfish people.' Another user, @ChickkinOz, said 'these people need to be financially responsible for this child and woman for life. Unbelievable, how are they parents.' While @BCmanutddesi called it 'OUTRAGEOUS!! 'This story just makes my blood boil!!,' @parentingfiles said. Australians are not the only people that travel to Thailand for surrogacy reasons. Earlier his year, there were 65 babies stuck in Thailand that were conceived by gay Israeli couples and birthed by surrogate Thai women, the Times of Israel said. The claims were made by the Facebook group 'Help Us Bring the Babies Home'. The babies were allegedly unable to be brought to Israel because the Interior Ministry Gideon Sa'ar has not granted Israeli citizenship to the infants. Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex. Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled: .

"Reece Burke’s last-minute tap in eased the pressure on Sam Allardyce as West Ham finally recorded their first win of pre-season against Sampdoria. The youngster tapped home after Mo Diame’s superb solo effort had hauled the Hammers level after goals from Stefan Okaka and Citadin Eder sandwiched Mark Noble’s penalty. But there were still plenty of concerns for Allardyce with the start of the Premier League season less than a week away and simmering tensions with the board and fans still brewing. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Kevin Nolan in West Ham's new kit ad and new signing Valencia . Happy Hammers! West Ham's players pose after winning the Marathonbet Cup by beating Sampdoria .

Subs: Massolo, Duncan, Fornasier, Wszolek. The need for a fit striker to replace the injured Andy Carroll was obvious, with Carlton Cole . floundering up top and Enner Valencia still some way from match fitness, and the ease with which Okaka and Eder walked through the home defence for their goals was the stuff of nightmares. The fact Kevin Nolan was already defending his manager in his programme notes before a Premier League ball has even been kicked must also raise question marks. There were encouraging signs though, with a new 3-5-2 formation working well in the first half and new signings Cheikhou Kouyate, Mauro Zarate and Aaron Cresswell – who was forced off with an injury after half an hour – all impressing, and Stuart Downing acclimatising well to a right wing-back role. It could easily have been a win too with Downing hitting the post late on and Nolan curling wide.West Ham looked the better in the early exchanges, passing the ball out of defence with ease, but went behind on 16 minutes.

Catch him if you can: Cheikhou Kouyate skips past Sampdoria's Roberto Soriano . Cole thought he had equalised but was ruled offside when he collected Cresswell’s scuffed shot, and Nolan wasted a superb opportunity when unmarked on the penalty spot. At the other end, Eder should have scored but dragged his effort wide from Lorenzo De Silvestri’s cut-back. Kouyate was winning over the Upton Park crowd with an all action display, blocking a chance at one end and then coming close twice at the other – sending a half volley straight at Da Costa and then just failing to control Mark Noble’s throughball. Noble did bring the Hammers level in first-half injury time. Cresswell’s replacement Dan Potts showed quick feet in the box and was brought down, with Noble coolly converting to the keeper’s left.

"Two volunteer paramedics 'seeking only to do good' at the scene of accidents must be prosecuted for using sirens and flashing lights, the High Court has ordered - 'with regret'. Judges upheld an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a refusal by Bury magistrates to convict Michael Issler and Mordechai Bamberger for using 'blues-and-twos'. The warning sirens and lights - used by police, paramedics and firefighters - helped the pair get to the scenes of accidents quicker than ambulances to give vital first aid. 'Blues-and-twos': The flashing blue light of a police car, like the ones used by Michael Issler and Mordechai Bamberger as they carried out their duties as medical volunteers for Salford's Hatzola service . The judges agreed that their use by civilians was in breach of road traffic regulations, but suggested that there might be scope for Parliament to change the rules. Lady Justice Rafferty, sitting with Mr Justice Jay in London, said she was 'saddened that medically trained citizens seeking only to do good, part of a scrupulously professional organisation with high standards and conspicuously shunning gratuitous publicity, find themselves effectively constrained in their efforts'. The initial prosecution came after Issler and Bamberger attended a accident involving a car and a motorcycle on the outskirts of Bury on October 14, 2012. Wearing high-visibility uniforms, they identified themselves to police as Hatzola Fast Response personnel and were allowed to offer medical assistance in advance of an NHS ambulance arriving at 8.25pm. But officers told the two men they would be reported for using the blues-and-twos on their vehicles. District Judge Richardson was told at their trial that Hatzola originated in the U.S. about 40 years ago with the overriding objective of preserving life, and has since spread to the UK. Its aim is to provide emergency first-aid cover in defined areas, in this case Salford and parts of Bury, primarily but not exclusively for the Jewish community. In Salford there are 20 Hatzola volunteers, 10 of whom are trained paramedics, including Mr Issler and Mr Bamberger. Their average response time to accidents is 'under two minutes', compared with seven to 10 minutes for NHS ambulances, the court heard. Their vehicles - Mr Issler's Renault Grand Espace Dynamique and Mr Bamberger's Mercedes saloon - carry medical equipment, including defibrillators, oxygen, and neck braces, as well as dressings, medications and some drugs. The Royal Courts of Justice: Mr Justice Jay said current laws did not provide an exemption for 'first responder' voluntary organisations like Hatzola to escape the restrictions on the use of blues-and-twos . First founded in Brooklyn, New York, in the late Sixties, Hatzola is a volunteer emergency medical service which now has a presence in Jewish communities throughout the world. As an organisation, it is the largest volunteer ambulance service in the world but, in effect, most groups work independently and are locally funded by donations from the Jewish community. Subscribers are given a special emergency number to call to put them through to a dispatcher, who then passes on the emergency message to the closest volunteer. Hatzolah's organisational model provides for response times that are typically much faster than public emergency services. Hatzolah is a Hebrew word meaning 'rescue' or 'relief'. It is sometimes also known as Chevra Hatzolah, which loosely translates as 'Company of Rescuers'. Judge Richardson said Hatzola's 24-hour-a-day work was funded by voluntary contributions from the Jewish community and declared: 'I found Hatzola to be a responsible, dedicated and public-spirited organisation with well-trained and motivated operatives, of whom the defendants were two.' He acquitted both men of the blues-and-twos charge on the grounds that their vehicles were being 'used for ambulance purposes'. But now the High Court judges have ruled that he had got the law wrong and agreed 'with regret' that the DPP's appeal must be allowed. Mr Justice Jay said road traffic legislation and the relevant regulations did not currently provide an exemption for 'first responder' voluntary organisations like Hatzola to escape the restrictions on the use of blues-and-twos. He added: 'To be clear: widening the exemption to reflect the modern context is a task for the Secretary of State and Parliament, if so advised, and not for this court.' The judge suggested it would not be difficult for legislators 'to alight on a form of words' to include Hatzola personnel within the exemption. Lady Justice Rafferty emphasised the 'importance or potential importance' of the case and her own 'reluctance to allow this appeal'. Agreeing with Mr Justice Jay's ruling, she said: 'Like him, I am driven to the view that this appeal must be allowed. 'Like him, I am saddened that medically trained citizens seeking only to do good, part of a scrupulously professional organisation with high standards and conspicuously shunning gratuitous publicity, find themselves effectively constrained in their efforts.'","Bury Magistrates had refused to convict Michael Issler and Mordechai Bamberger for using police-style flashing lights and sirens .

"Snapchat has been dubbed a next generation messaging service and is just two years old. Its logo is pictured . A two-year-old social media company has turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook, despite making no income from normal business. Snapchat, which has been dubbed a next generation messaging service, is just two years old and was started by 23-year-old Evan Spiegel and friends. The co-founder of the company has reportedly turned down the huge all-cash offer, which would have valued Snapchat $4 billion – but the firm is said to be being wooed by other investors and possible buyers. Sources close to the company told The Wall Street Journal that Mr Spiegel, who dropped out of Stanford University, is hoping for a better offer. While California-based Snapchat has no sales or business model, its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds, making it a truly instant service, instead of a more permanent record collector like Twitter or Facebook. Snapchat, which has been dubbed a next generation messaging service, is just two-years-old and was started by 23-year-old Evan Spiegel (left) and Bobby Murphy (right). Last week the pair filed a restraining order against Frank Reginald Brown, who co-founded the app, to cease and desist from making any more information public . According to sources, Mr Spiegel thinks the app’s user numbers have lots of potential to grow and just two months ago, the company’s usage had reportedly risen dramatically to 350 million messages a day, from 200 million in June. However, the company does not disclose its numbers and has not commented on the rumours. The offer comes one week after Twitter, another popular but unprofitable messaging service, realised a market value of approximately $25 billion after its IPO and image sharing app Pinterest raised $225 million from investors who valued the company at a huge $3.8 billion. Snapchat joins an exclusive club of tech start-ups which have snubbed multibillion dollar buyout offers. Groupon turned down an offer from Google of almost $6 billion in 2010 and Facebook and Twitter have both turned down offers over the years, deciding to grow their businesses organically instead. This latest funding brings the total investment in the firm to $123m. Almost half a million of that came from Michael Lynton who left his role as chairman of Sony Entertainment to join Snapchat earlier this year. Other investors include Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital . Shervin Pishevar, an entrepreneur co-founder of venture-capital firm Sherpa Ventures, said: ‘There is no shame in getting an Instagram result, but there is tremendous glory in building a stand-alone multibillion-dollar company.’ Facebook snapped up photographic app Instagram for almost $1 billion, just two years after it was founded. Snapchat has carved a niche in the crowded social media marketplace as its messages disappear after 10 seconds and is popular among 13 to 25-year-olds – a group that is increasingly less engaged with more established networks. Facebook admitted that while it is making more money via mobile advertising, fewer young teenagers are using its site regularly to chat to friends. The social networt reportedly tried to acquire Snapchat last year for $1 billion but raised its offer to $3 billion, which, if it was accepted, would be Facebook’s largest acquisition to date. While it is expected that Snapchat will . receive more buyout and investment offers due to its popularity, experts . are unsure how the service will make money, but think that one option . might be to help marketing companies create messages that speak to its . young users. While California-based Snapchat has no sales of business model, its smartphone app delivers millions of messages that disappear in less than 10 seconds, making it a truly instant service . Julie Ask, principal analyst at Forrester Research believes this could include more personalised narrative content instead of banner adverts. ‘If you can create content, whether it is a photo or a video or a story, and get it onto one of these instant messaging apps, it has the potential to go viral so fast because the community of users is so big,’ she said. While the app might have the potential to generate revenue from advertising, some analysts believe Snapchat runs the risk of becoming one of many similar services. Benedict Evans, an analyst at Enders Analysis, predicts similar young apps will flood the market as more and more people use smartphones. ‘There are going to be a dozen companies that look something like this, and Facebook can't buy them all,’ he said. Snapchat was started by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford University where he was studying product Design between 2008 and 2012. He told The Huffington Post that he came up with the idea of a temporary photo sharing and messaging service as a friend of his regretted sending a photo. Together with Bobby Murphy, he looked at other apps that were deleting text and photos and realised they had a stigma attached to them because content disappeared. He spoke about the idea in April 2011 in his product design class for his final project and classmates are said to have balked at the idea of impermanent photos. Undeterred, the duo built a prototype and realised it was fun and exciting sending temporary photos back and forth and decided to persevere with the idea and turn it into a business. Mr Spiegel launched the company in September 2011 in his father’s living room. He reportedly dropped out of his Stanford class just three classes before graduation, in order to move back to his father’s house and to work full time on Snapchat. Before that, he had worked as a software developer at Intuit for seven months on ‘a stealth project involving SMS technology’ before starting work on his app. Despite the offer of riches, he still lives at home. In May 2012, 25 images were being sent every second and in November 2012 users had shared over one billion photos on the iOS app. Snapchat rolled out an app for Android smartphones in November 2012. In June this year, the company introduced Snapkidz for users under the age of 13. It allows children to take snaps and draw pictures, but they are unable to send their creations to other users. Writing on his LinkedIn profile, Mr Spiegel said: ‘Snapchatters have shared over fifteen billion unique images through the service since January 2012, making Snapchat one of the top 10 apps in the iTunes App Store.’ Facebook admitted fewer young teenagers are using its site (pictured) regularly to chat to friends. The social network reportedly tried to acquire Snapchat last year for $1 billion but raised its offer to $3 billion, which, if it was accepted, would be Facebook's  largest acquisition to date .","Snapchat, a next .

"Celebrated cellist Julian Lloyd Webber is to retire from performing as a result of a medical problem which has restricted his ability to play. The 63-year-old - brother to composer Andrew - said he was 'devastated' to end his career as a musician, which will end with a final performance next week. Lloyd Webber explained that he has a 'herniated disc' in his neck which has reduced the power in his right arm in which he holds his bow. Forced to retire: British cellist Julian Lloyd Webber performs during the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games . He has been one of the foremost British cellists for many years and his recordings have included an acclaimed version of Elgar's Cello Concerto, and one of his performances became a TV staple when it featured as the theme to arts series The South Bank Show. Four-times married Lloyd Webber said: 'I am devastated. There were so many exciting plans that cannot now come to fruition. 'I have had an immensely fulfilling career and feel privileged to have worked with so many great musicians and orchestras but now I have to move on.' His last concert as a performer takes place at the Forum Theatre, Malvern, with the English Chamber Orchestra on May 2, but he said wants to continue to contribute to the music world.

He went on: 'I have no intention of enduring a forced retirement though. I would like to use the knowledge I have gained through my life as a musician and an educator to give back as much as I can to the music profession which has given me so much over the years. 'I have just completed two new recordings which will be released later this year but after May 2 my cello will fall silent. 'I now need time to reflect and to consider this sudden and distressing life-changing situation and there will be no further comment at this time'. Brothers: Andrew (right) and Julian Lloyd Webber together at Highbury Grove School in Islington, north London . His brother Andrew - who composed Variations which went on to be known as The South Bank Show theme - said: 'I am devastated by my brother's news. 'I have known of Julian's difficulties for some while and, like him, I was hoping this would not come to pass. Music has lost one of its finest performers.'

Julian Lloyd Webber made his professional debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London in 1972 when he gave the first London performance of the Cello Concerto by Sir Arthur Bliss. His Brit award-winning Elgar Cello Concerto, conducted by Yehudi Menuhin was selected by BBC Music Magazine as the finest ever version. In May 2001, he was granted the first busker's licence on the London Underground. 'It is good to have variety in life,' Lloyd Webber said at the time. 'I like to play to people but the next stop will be the Royal Albert Hall.' His older brother, musical impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber, paid tribute, saying he 'had known of Julian's difficulties for some while and, like him, I was hoping this would not come to pass. 'Music has lost one of its finest performers.' His last album, A Tale of Two Cellos was a compilation of more than 20 duets for two cellos and piano and featured Lloyd Webber performing with his wife, Jiaxin Cheng. His final concert as a performer is to take place at the Forum Theatre, Malvern, with the English Chamber Orchestra on 2 May.","63-year-old said he was 'devastated' to end his career as a musician .

"Says they are worse after spending time with their mother Brooke Mueller . Charlie posted a picture of a birthday cake with a grenade on Twitter as a message to Brooke . Sheen lashed out at Mueller calling her a 'chubby weirdo' after her bid to get a restraining order against him on Monday failed . TMZ have obtained pictures of Bob which allegedly show him sporting a red mark, which Charlie is said to believe is a burn, after a visit to his mother. However, Brooke insists he had the mark before he arrived at her home . Denise Richards says she can no longer care for Charlie Sheen’s ‘violent’ twins, and has revealed distrubing and distressing details about the troubled boys. The 42-year-old actress was granted temporary custody of her ex-husband’s four-year-old sons Bob and Max after their mother, Brooke Mueller was admitted to rehab for the 21st time earlier this year. However, Denise has written to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that she will no longer look after the boys because of their violent outbursts towards her daughters and dogs, according to TMZ. Violent: While Denise Richards took in Charlie Sheen's sons earlier this year when their mother went to rehab, she says she can no longer care for them after they started attacking her daughters and dogs . Denise reportedly blames Brooke completely for the boys’ behaviour and TMZ reports she revealed they have lashed out at her children, Sam, nine, and Lola, eight, who are Charlie’s daughters and Denise’s adopted child Eloise, two. The website says Denise claims ‘her daughters have been strangled, kicked in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit on by Bob and Max’. She also alleges they have thrown their own faeces at her daughters. After visiting Brooke, Bob is said to have thrown a toy at Sam which left her needing medical attention. They are also said to have attacked Denise’s dogs, with TMZ reporting they ‘repeatedly kick her dogs in the head and squeeze their heads with both hands while watching the dogs whimper in pain. Blame: Denise blames Bob and Max's mother Brooke Mueller (pictured here in 2011) for their violent outbursts and claims the children are traumatised after visiting her . The kids will flip from sweetly petting the dog to strangling the animals and lifting them off the ground by the neck’. The twins, who Denise says often go into a 'zombie-like state' are said to have told Denise they ‘wanted to hurt and kill the dogs’. Their behaviour is not limited to home with Bob in particular, reportedly attacking fellow students and teachers at the school they started in November. According to TMZ, Denise attributes the bad behaviour to time spent with Brooke and says the twins suffer terrible nightmares after spending time at her home. Meanwhile, TMZ have obtained pictures of Bob, which allegedly show him before and after a visit with his mother on July 26. After the visit, he was reportedly sporting a red mark, which sources tell TMZ Charlie believe was a burn, although Brooke insisted he had it before he arrived at her home. Denise included the photographic evidence in her letter to DCFS. Concerned: Charlie is concerned about letting Brooke have access to the twins and has lashed out calling her a 'whore' and a 'chubby weirdo' Richards claims she has been advised to get counselling for the twins but Brooke has refused to allow it. News of Denise’s letter comes just after Charlie, 48, branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. He wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. ‘you are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me and my boys (sic)’ He also posted a bizarre 'birthday' message to her on Tuesday, even though Brooke turned 36 in August. He captioned a picture of a grenade on top of a cake with the words: 'happy Bday Brooke when you're done sucking off the parking lot at Home Depot why don't ya 'blow' out this candle. c' Brooke - who left rehab last month - claimed in her petition for the restraining order that her ex-husband has threatened her life and stated she believes he is on a mission to sabotage her sobriety and could even plant drugs on her in his bid to keep her away from their sons. Uncertain future: It is unclear what exactly will happen to the twins if Denise asks for them to be removed from her home . According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned. ‘I will exercise every resource at my disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’ A follow-up hearing has been set for next month. At the weekend, Denise was reportedly informed by the DCFS that she was not allowed to take the children over to the actor's house for a visit. A source claimed that officials told the actress that they were annoyed with Charlie after he claimed his sons were in danger and were not being protected by the department after they were allowed an overnight stay with Brooke. The 48-year-old actor blasted Brooke on Twitter as an ‘evil and pathetic uber loser’ and slammed the DCFS as being ‘inept’. Feud: Charlie and Brooke's relationship has deteriorated so badly that she recently sought a restraining order against him while he hit out calling her a 'whore'","Says they are worse after spending time with their mother Brooke Mueller .

"High end: Restauranter Nino Selimaj with the Bellisima Pizza in New York . A luxurious caviar pizza costing $1,000 has proved a hit after being added to a New York restaurant's menu. The extravagant pie is the creation of New York restauranteur Nino Selimaj, owner of Nino's Bellissima Pizza in Manhattan. Most of the price-tag comes in the hefty serving of caviar which tops the pizza, which in itself costs $820. Hundreds of people have already bought the decadent dish, which is among the most expensive pizzas in the world. Two of the world's top caviars, Beluga, and the intensely-flavoured Black Russian Royal Sevruga, are among the varieties selected for Nino's creation. The fish flavour is further enhanced by thinly sliced lobster and creme fraiche, and topped off with a salmon roll, chives and wasabi paste. Nino, who owns five restaurants in the city, said: 'I've been in the city for 33 years and I serve caviar in all my restaurants. 'I wanted something different for my pizza restaurant. 'I didn't want just a traditional marinara or margherita. I wanted something specific and unique and so I came up with the $1,000 pizza, and it's worth every penny.' Nino has been serving up the pizza fit for Russian tzars for four years, and still prepares around one a week for caviar devotees. He spent three months trialling different ingredients including white truffles and olive oil, before coming up with the perfect caviar, lobster and creme fraiche mix. Nino said: 'There was a bit of a slow down with the economy, but we're still selling around 50 a year. 'The . price of caviar has actually increased too, so people are getting more . for their money, and my profit margin on the pizza has decreased.

'People who know about their caviar love this pizza. We sell them to politicians, Wall Street traders, or couples celebrating a birthday or anniversary. 'It is definitely a pizza for people who like caviar. People who don't like caviar think it is outrageous, and crazy to pay this much. 'But diners always see it on the menu and ask about it, why it is so expensive and how many we sell. People are always curious.' Taste: Two of the world's top caviars, Beluga, and the intensely-flavoured Black Russian Royal Sevruga, are among the $1,000 pizza ingredients - thinly sliced lobster, creme fraiche, chives and wasabi paste also feature .

"The Super Bowl will be staked out by snipers and SWAT teams while fighter jets fly overhead as part of a tight blanket of security around Sunday's game. As a 'level-one' national security event, Super Bowl XLVIII at the MetLife stadium in New Jersey will be tightly locked down by federal, state and local authorities. Snipers will keep a close eye from birds' nests in the roof of the stadium as the Denver Broncos take on the Seattle Seahawks in front of 82,000 fans. Scroll down for video .

Amtrak Police K-9 team patrol as passengers prepare to embark a train at Penn Station on Thursday as they ramped up security in time for the Super Bowl . Despite no specific terror threats . against the Super Bowl, federal and local authorities have security . teams on high alert and studied intelligence about recent attacks on . mass transit in Russia, law enforcement officials said this week. 'Certainly, we're keeping an eye on . activities around the world, but as of this time, there are no threats . directed against this event that we're aware of,' New York City Police . Commissioner William Bratton said a security briefing in Manhattan on Wednesday. Snipers are part of a typical security program at the Super Bowl. Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam told my9nj.com: 'Snipers have a better angle then anyone who is on the ground to actually hit that target. It’s an entire team that communicates. 'You have individuals who are at high altitudes inside the arena and then you have individuals that are on the ground moving in and around the crowd.' Lt. Anthony Gracia of New Jersey's North Newfield Police Department told examiner.com that fighter jets from the Continental United States Aerospace Defense Command Region are set to protect the skies around the stadium in Meadowlands. Because . this year's Super Bowl has the distinction of relying on mass transit . to take up to 30,000 fans to the game, the deadly bombings in the . southern Russian city of Volograd have raised worries here, said Col. Rick Fuentes, head of the New Jersey State Police. Security is also tight around Super Bowl Boulevard in Times Square, according to NYPD chief William Bratton who said officers had been running safety drills for weeks . Snipers are part of common security procedures at the Super Bowl, as seen here at the 2012 game at Lucas Oil stadium in Indianapolis . New Jersey transit staff will be conducting bag searches on the thousands of fans traveling to Sunday's big game . The suicide attacks on a trolleybus and a train station that killed more than 30 people within weeks of the Winter Olympics also prompted a series of meetings among the planners for Super Bowl security, he said. Local officials are counting on the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security 'to keep an eye on and brief us on those events,' Fuentes said. 'There is a concern with mass transit and we've prepared ourselves for it.' Trains, buses and cars taking fans from New York and parts of New Jersey to the stadium and back again 'are going to be scanned, they're going to be checked, they're going to be swept,' he said. In Manhattan, the NYPD is drawing on its experience securing the annual New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, the New York City Marathon, the U.N. General Assembly and other high-profile events to secure 'Super Bowl Boulevard' - a 13-block street fair on Broadway. The department has deployed hundreds of extra uniformed and plainclothes police officers to the area. It's also relying on bomb-sniffing dogs, portable radiation detectors and a vast network of surveillance cameras to detect trouble. In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, the NYPD rehearsed its response to a variety of potential threats, including 'the backpack left unsecured scenario,' Bratton said. 'We are very, very well-prepared.' The state police plan to assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on Sunday, Fuentes said. A security center has been set up in a hollowed-out building across a highway from the stadium that's slated to become a mammoth retail and entertainment complex. A 24-hour FBI command center will monitor the latest counter-terrorism intelligence, said Aaron Ford, head of the FBI's Newark office. A viewing platform with security barriers is set up at the New Jersey stadium where more than 82,000 people will attend Sunday's game . Measures have been taken to protect power grids and to make sure there's plenty of backup energy in case of another blackout like the one last year at the game in New Orleans, said Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's head of security. 'This year we're going to try to go blackout free,' Miller said. 'One thing that I've learned is that you don't want to be overconfident. You want to prepare and be ready. You just don't know what you might face on game day.' Randy Killikevc, a tourist from Tennessee who attended a Super Bowl party in Byrant Park on Wednesday, said possible threats against the Super Bowl weren't on his mind. 'If terrorists were going to strike New York why not do it on New Year's Eve? There's lots more people here (then),' he said.","As a 'level-one' national security event, Super Bowl XLVIII at the MetLife stadium in New Jersey will have heightened security .

"The only way is skinny: The perpetually slimming TOWIE girls Billie Faiers, Lauren Goodger and Lydia Bright bestelling OMG diet, which makes a number of bizarre claims as to how to shed the pounds . THE CLAIM The . book’s title is inspired by the stars of The Only Way Is Essex and . their obsession with competitive dieting. Author Venice A. Fulton urges . readers to ‘be skinnier than all your friends’. THE SCIENCE A British study of 2,000 women aged 18 to 45 found that 54 per cent said the first thing they noticed about another woman was her weight – and they then compared themselves with her. So playing on this competitive aspect is clever of Fulton. A US study in 2011 said our food choices are affected by our friends and if we hang out with ‘skinny’ women, we are more likely to be slim too. EXPERT SAYS ‘Six Weeks To OMG is a catchy slogan that attracts the Facebook generation,’ says Donovan Pyle, cognitive behavioural therapist at The Insight Network. ‘The quirky advice has a novelty factor and the six weeks angle appeals to our love of a quick fix. The competition of “Get Skinnier than all your friends” can be motivating but I’d hate to think the book encourages girls to focus on being skinny rather than healthy.’ VERDICT DITCH IT . THE CLAIM ‘No carbs before . Marbs,’ as they say in TOWIE. Fulton claims that if you want to  be . slim, you must aim for no  more than 120 grams of carbohydrate a day. It . makes no difference if you get all of your carbs from cans of coke or . plates of broccoli, says the book. THE SCIENCE Despite the sensational comparison of broccoli to Coke, Fulton is not saying broccoli is bad – just that we need to limit our carbohydrate intake and make every meal half-protein if we want to stay slim. A 2008 study involving more than 1,000 overweight adults found those on high protein and low glycaemic index (slow-burning carbs) diets had more successful maintenance of weight loss than those on low-fat, low-calorie diets. Another study in Seattle showed an increase in protein resulted in rapid loss of weight and body fat. EXPERT VIEW ‘People handle carbs differently. Serial dieters will store carbs as fat more readily than someone who doesn’t diet,’ says Dr Carel le Roux, obesity specialist at Imperial College London. ‘But I would always encourage people to eat plenty of vegetables.’ VERDICT DITCH IT . THE CLAIM Fruit is good for its fibre and nutrients but it also contains fructose, which stops leptin from switching off your appetite, so you won’t feel full after you’ve eaten it. Smoothies and juices are dangerous, says Fulton, because you can drink more fructose than you can eat, which means calories go unnoticed. THE SCIENCE A review in 2011 said liquid carbohydrates fill you up less than solids and that there is likely to be an increase in total long-term energy intake. On the most basic level, a smoothie isn’t going to fill you up. EXPERT VIEW ‘I’ve seen patients who can’t understand their obesity because they eat healthily. Then it turns out they are eating too much fruit or drinking fruit smoothies, downing 300 calories in a couple of minutes,’ says Dr le Roux. ‘Some smoothies have more calories than a McDonald’s milkshake. Fruit is great, but if you are trying to lose weight, limit yourself to one piece a day.’ VERDICT DO IT . THE CLAIM Two cups of black coffee boosts the nervous system and when you have it on an empty stomach, it tells your body to burn fat faster. The effects last for four to five hours, according to Fulton. THE SCIENCE Studies show that caffeine speeds up the metabolism by ten per cent. It increases the heart rate and the flow of blood. A 2011 study concluded that coffee assists fat loss. As soon as coffee is digested, it stimulates the release of fats into the blood, which then become the body’s primary energy source before it reverts to using its limited stores of carbohydrate for fuel. EXPERT VIEW ‘Two cups of coffee will increase your basal metabolic rate by five to ten per cent for two hours,’ says Dr  Nicola Lowe, senior lecturer in nutrition at the University of Central Lancashire. ‘The mechanism isn’t clear but caffeine is a stimulant so perhaps it increases nervous activity, making the body move more. New studies show it helps the body use carbohydrates more effectively. Caffeine also reduces our feeling of pain and effort so  it can boost performance if you drink before exercise.’ VERDICT DO IT . Breakfast: Not the day's most important meal, experts say . THE CLAIM Breakfast isn’t the most important meal of the day, says Fulton, who argues that if you skip it and do early-morning exercise on an empty tummy, you’ll kickstart the body into burning fat. THE SCIENCE Studies into intermittent fasting show it can help you lose weight, burn fat, stabilise bloodsugar, and reduce blood-pressure and cholesterol. Skipping breakfast is one way. Other approaches include fasting on alternate days, or very low-calorie diets two days a week. But other research connects skipping breakfast with obesity and low concentration and anyone with diabetes or low blood-sugar should ask a doctor first. EXPERT VIEW ‘We’ve been brought up to think breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but research is challenging this,’ says Dr le Roux. ‘Exercising on an empty stomach is not going to make . you feel unwell and you will burn fat. Some are naturally not hungry in the morning but eat breakfast anyway, consuming 500 calories for no reason.’ VERDICT DO IT . Snacking: A big no no . THE CLAIM Rather than ‘grazing’, Fulton says eating three meals a day – lunch, mid-afternoon and early evening – controls your appetite as it releases leptin (a chemical that tells our brain we’re full). Having longer gaps between meals encourages the body to burn fat. THE SCIENCE A study in the US found that those who ate three low-calorie, high-protein meals daily felt more satisfied and less hungry. EXPERT VIEW ‘Three quality, home-cooked meals a day is the best way to eat,’ says Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. ‘On a more practical level, people who graze tend to eat bad foods (crisps, snacks). It could be that grazing food through the day means your brain never gets the signals that say you are full, as Fulton says, but so many chemical reactions occur when we eat food, it’s hard to be certain.’ VERDICT DO IT . THE CLAIM Taking a cool bath between 15C and 20C every morning encourages your body to burn stored fat as it tries to keep warm. It will boost metabolism for up to 15 hours, says Fulton, as cold activates ‘good’ brown fat, burning calories to keep warm. THE SCIENCE Some scientists think brown fat is the magic key to weight loss. A Canadian study chilled a group of men and found their metabolic rates increased by 80 per cent. The brown fat burned 250 calories in three hours. Obesity has even been linked to central heating. EXPERT VIEW ‘Sitting in an icecold bath will burn extra calories and raise metabolism, but I’m not sure how long the effect would last,’ says Tom Barber, professor of endocrinology at the University of Warwick. ‘You might just be subjecting your body to a massive insult every morning.’ VERDICT DITCH IT .","The OMG diet is a global phenomenon. The book that promises to help you drop 20 lb in just six weeks has outsold the Dukan Diet. Written by personal trainer Paul Khanna (under the pen name Venice A. Fulton) and inspired by TV show The Only Way Is Essex, Six Weeks To OMG: Get Skinnier Than All Your Friends has been dismissed by many doctors as gimmicky at best, and dangerous at worst. The advice, which includes skipping breakfast and going easy on the broccoli, might be bizarre, but it has sold 120,000 copies. Most bizarre of all, it has some scientific basis. MARIANNE POWER and ALICE SMELLIE spoke to experts and found what to do and what to ditch."
"England know they may never have a better chance of beating Australia on the Kangaroos' own turf as the old enemies prepare to lock horns in Melbourne on Sunday. Home coach Tim Sheens accepts all the pressure is on his injury-decimated Australia side after their first defeat in four years left them vulnerable to an early exit from the 2014 Four Nations Series. That unexpected result against New Zealand in Brisbane has had the statisticians poring through the record books this week. England are confident they can cause an upset against an Australia side that lost to New Zealand . It is 60 years since Australia last failed to reach the final of a major tournament - Great Britain beat France in the climax to the inaugural World Cup in 1954. But Sheens' men will miss out on a trip to Wellington on November 15 if the Kiwis avoid a shock defeat to outsiders Samoa in Wharangei on Saturday and 24 hours later the Australians suffer their first back-to-back losses at home since their last Ashes Series defeat in 1970. Both teams will be wearing special jerseys to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the famous Rorke's Drift Test in Sydney, which was won by an England team reduced to nine men at times because of injury, and survivors from the last British team to win in Melbourne have been queuing up to talk up the chances of Steve McNamara's team emulating their feat from 22 years ago. Current scrum-half Matty Smith, who made his Test debut in England's opening 32-26 win over Samoa last Saturday, says the confidence of the class of 1992 is not misplaced. Matty Smith (left) says Steve McNamara's side are ready to face the Kangeroos with a win under their belt . 'It's a pretty young squad,' Smith said. 'There's not much fear there. I think we've all done really well with our clubs this year and we've been picked on merit so we're confident. We've trained really well and we're going into it with a win under our belts as well. 'We're looking forward to Sunday. It's looking really good. There's no bigger opportunity to beat the Aussies in their own backyard. It's going to be a great day and hopefully we can perform and do everyone proud.' England are waiting on the fitness of newly-appointed captain Sean O'Loughlin, who was in the Great Britain team that won in Sydney in 2006, while Australia, already shorn of a dozen established internationals, still have a question mark over half-back Daly Cherry-Evans, and Sheens himself has been quarantined after coming down with flu-like symptoms. Australia are waiting on the fitness of Daly Cherry-Evans, and are already missing a dozen top players . If McNamara can restore the inspirational O'Loughlin to an already impressive-looking pack, it will significantly improve their chances of reaching a third Four Nations final, their first in the southern hemisphere. Without a warm-up match, England were always going to improve from their opening fixture, regardless of the result, and Smith is confident there is much more to come, both from the team as a whole and from his new half-back partnership with Gareth Widdop, who will be back on familiar territory after starting his professional career at Melbourne Storm. 'Gaz is a great player,' Smith said. 'I've watched him for a few years now. He's my roomy on tour and I think it was a great move by the coaching staff to put me in with him. England could be boosted by the return of new captain Sean O'Loughlin, who may be fit enough for Sunday . 'You get to know each other a little bit and I've been spending a lot of time with Gaz, drinking a few coffees and hanging around with him. That all helps when you go into the games to get a good partnership going. 'It's pretty new for me obviously being in this environment. I'm enjoying playing with him and hopefully we can have a good last couple of sessions and go into Australia really confident that we can do a job. 'It was nerve-wracking for me putting on an England shirt for the first time but it was great to get off to a winning start. I thought as a team we probably could have played a bit better but we got the job done, we got the two points, and we'll be better this week against a tough Australian side.'","England will reach first Four Nations final in Southern hemisphere with win .

"Hull KR have signed Leeds' long-serving forward Ryan Bailey on a two-year contract. The Robins have acted quickly to fill the void created by the sudden retirement of Australian prop Justin Poore by recruiting the 30-year-old Bailey, who has spent all his career at the Rhinos, with whom he won six Grand Finals, three World Club Challenge titles and this year's Challenge Cup. He is now set to make his Hull KR debut against his home-town club in the opening match of the new Super League season in February. Hull KR have signed prop Ryan Bailey on a two-year contract from Leeds Rhinos . 'I've achieved a lot of things at Leeds over a 14-year period but I'm ready for a new challenge at Hull KR,' said Bailey, who made more than 300 appearances for Leeds. 'It was a difficult decision to leave Leeds, I was born in the city and I've won some great finals with the club but now I want to bring some of that experience to Rovers. It's going to be a big challenge but I'm looking forward to it and I'll be meeting it head on. 'The fans are really passionate and hopefully we can breed a winning culture and start getting to finals. We've got some really ambitious players who want to win things here at Hull KR and hopefully I can add to that and bring a bit of grunt up front. 'We've got a big game at the start of the season against Leeds and that will be a perfect way to hopefully make my debut. I know from experience that the ground is a daunting place to go to, it's tough for opposition teams and we've got to make the most of that.

"At least 29 people have been killed by Syrian government airstrikes in the Islamic State stronghold city of Raqqa. Eight blasts tore through the north eastern region today as President Assad's army takes further steps to regain control from the extremist group. Nine IS fighters are thought to have been killed alongside 20 civilians, most of whom died when a missile struck a crowded bakery. Scroll down for video . Syrian government air strikes killed at least 29 people in the Islamic State stronghold city of Raqqa today . Images and footage posted on social media and the Raqqa Media Centre  showed rubble-filled streets in the north eastern city . Videos of the destruction were uploaded to social media websites accompanied, in one case, with the chilling observation of one activist who said: 'Raqqa is being silently slaughtered'. Most of the dead were killed after the first blast which struck the Andalous bakery, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Abu Ibrahim, an activist posting on a media collective, said one local morgue was inundated with charred bodies, making formal identification difficult. He added eight members of the same family died in the strikes. The Raqqa Media Centre uploaded a video of the aftermath showing hollowed cars and ravaged buildings. It comes as Iraq's air force struck a hospital in an Islamic State-controlled town, killing seven patients and wounding 22 others. The attack near Kirkuk city is one of a series of raids by war aircraft in the area according to witnesses. Few journalists have been able to access conflict-torn Raqqa since IS fighters took hold of the city, home to an estimated 500,000 people, earlier this year. Residents fight to extinguish a fire after eight explosions tore through the region on Saturday . Twenty civilians died in the blasts, with the majority thought to have been killed when a missile struck a busy bakery . The city has been largely cut-off from the world's media after being taken by IS fighters earlier this year. Residents examine the sky for military aircraft after today's strikes . The mother of a Lebanese soldier claims her son is the second to have been beheaded by IS militants after seeing photographs of the apparent execution online. Zeinab Noun said her 20-year-old son, Abbas Medlej, was 'sacrificed' after supporters of the militant Sunni group posted images celebrating his death on Twitter. Medlej was among a group of 19 Lebanese soldiers taken captive after the extremist group stormed a border town earlier this month. His captors claim to have killed him when he tried to escape after pretending to go to the bathroom. A caption posted with the images on a Twitter account used to publish Islamic State statements named the soldier as Abbas Medlij, identifying him as a Shiite Muslim. His mother urged revenge on the militant group, with the soldier's uncle threatening: 'Every Syrian in Lebanon is a target'. His death would be the fourth publicised beheading at the hands of the Islamic State since it swept regions of Syria and Iraq last month. American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were killed in similar circumstances, their murders filmed for propaganda which has circled the globe. The strikes come after Islamic State fighters swept into neighbouring Iraq, seizing parts of the country in a declared proto-state straddling of the border. There has not been government comment on the airstrikes. In a separate incident, a Syrian military helicopter is thought to have dropped a barrel bomb on a bus station in a rebel-held neighbourhood of the northern city of Aleppo killing 15 people. Residents of Haydariyeh were still pulling bodies from beneath rubble on Saturday evening in the city's latest tragedy following months of unrelenting bloodshed. Syrian forces are alleged to have unleashed hundreds of the explosive-filled barrels in Aleppo since anti-government rebels seized the country's second largest city earlier this year.","Eight blasts tore through IS-held north eastern city .

"Colonel Gaddafi's fourth son was in the process of building a luxury cruise liner with a giant glass tank containing six sharks when his father's regime was overthrown last year. Hannibal Gaddafi envisioned the 120-ton shark aquarium to form the centrepiece of the vessel so it could wow up-to-3,500 passengers. Inside the tank, he wanted two sand sharks, two white sharks and two blacktip reef sharks. Luxury: Colonel Gaddafi's fourth son Hannibal was in the process of building cruise liner Phoenicia (pictured), which was to contain a giant glass tank containing six sharks, when his father's regime was overthrown . Grand scheme: Hannibal wanted two sand sharks (pictured), two white sharks and two blacktip reef sharks inside the tank . A commander of a Libyan militia holding two British journalists last night said they have been handed over to state intelligence, accusing them of espionage. Tripoli militia commander Faraj al-Swehli said the two journalists were found with classified documents and pictures, including a data base of mercenaries apparently hired by then-ruler Moammar Gadhafi. The journalists were identified as reporter Nicholas Davies and cameraman Gareth Montgomery-Johnson. They were detained at the end of February and were working for Press TV, an Iranian TV network. Four biologists would have taken . permanent residence on the ship - called the Phoenicia - so they could . look after the fish, while a dedicated shark food shop would have looked . after their nutritional needs. The 36-year-old had decided the liner would come complete with large statues, marble columns and gold-framed mirrors. He dreamt up the extravagant concept after becoming frustrated at his inability to charter cruise ships at short notice. However, . the vessel never saw the light of day thanks to last year's unrest in . Libya that saw his father Muammar killed by rebels forces in October.

Hannibal fled with his wife and other members of the Gaddafi family to neighbouring Algeria in August, where he remains in exile. He began his sea-faring career in 1993 and quickly rose to take charge of Libya's maritime industry. Hannibal had previously tried, unsuccessfully, to hire cruise liners at short notice from MSG.

"A blood splattered cricket bat, a pistol on the mat and a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs - this is the horrific scene faced by police when they entered Oscar Pistorius's home. The photographs show the blood-soaked bathroom in his villa in Pretoria where the runner shot his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013. The gun used to kill Miss Steenkamp lies on a small mat while a bloodied cricket bat lies nearby. Scroll down for video . Scene of horror: This photograph shows the blood-soaked bathroom where Oscar Pistorius shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in the toilet cubicle (top) with his 9mm pistol (seen lying on a bathmat, right) and the blood-splattered cricket bat (bottom right) he used to break down the toilet door after killing her . The Olympic Blade Runner, 27, claims he used the bat to break down the toilet door after he shot his girlfriend by mistake. Another image shows a pool of blood at the bottom of the staircase as well as specks on the walls. Pistorius was expected to take to the stand last week to testify at his murder trial but court was immediately adjourned because one of the judge's two assessors was unwell in hospital. The double-amputee Paralympic champion is facing 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder for killing lover Reeva Steenkamp. Grim: Another graphic image shows a pool of blood at the bottom of the staircase where Pistorius carried Miss Steenkamp after shooting her. Blue arrows point to specks of blood on the wall and floor . Graphic: In this close up shot the gun, still cocked, that was used to kill Reeva Steenkamp lies on a bathmat in the bathroom next to blood smeared across the floor . Macabre: Blood is splattered across bathroom floor, most likely caused when Pistorius carried his girlfriend out of the toilet in a panic after, he claims, shooting her by accident believing she was an intruder . Defence lawyers for the runner, who is the only eyewitness in the case, were due to begin their case last week after four weeks of prosecution-led testimony. But Judge Thokozile Masipa said that one of her two assessors, legal experts who are helping her with the case, was unwell and that the trial had to be delayed until April 7 as the court would not be properly constituted. Prosecutors took 15 days to lay out their case against the 27-year-old, arguing he deliberately killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year by firing four rounds from a 9 mm pistol through a closed toilet door. Evidence: A close-up of the bloodied cricket bat (left) and the toilet cubicle door (right) through which Pistorius shot four times, hitting Miss Steenkamp in the hip, arm and head on the other side . Adjourned: Oscar Pistorius, left, leaves the high court in Pretoria, South Africa, on Friday . Pistorius shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, through the closed door of a toilet cubicle in his home in the night, later saying he mistook her for an intruder . Several neighbours testified to hearing a woman's terrified screams before a volley of shots, countering Pistorius' assertions that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder hiding in the toilet cubicle in the middle of the night. The world-famous athlete pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and also not guilty to three other firearm-related counts. The trial has gripped South Africa and millions of athletics fans around the world who saw Pistorius as a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. March 3: The trial begins with testimony from neighbour Michell Burger who claims she heard 'blood-curdling screams' before gunshots were fired at the time Oscar Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp. His lawyer Barry Roux says he intends to call a witness to testify that Pistorius screams sounded like a woman in a bid to discredit the claims. March 4: Pistorius breaks down in court as Mr Roux argues that Miss Steenkamp was so badly brain damaged by the gunshot to her head she couldn't possibly have screamed for help. Physically sick: Oscar Pistorius vomits into a bucket as the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem on Reeva Steenkamp gave a graphic account of her injuries . March 5: Mr Roux seeks to undermine the testimony of a couple who say they heard a woman's screams and gunfire on the night the athlete shot his girlfriend. Barry Roux said similarities in the accounts given by husband and wife Michell Burger and Charl Johnson indicated they had aligned their versions at the expense of the truth. March 6: Pistorius weeps in the dock as a neighbour describes the harrowing moment he tried to resuscitate his girlfriend after she was shot. Radiologist Johan Stipp dashed to the Paralympian's home after hearing gunshots to find Pistorius kneeling next to Reeva Steenkamp and 'praying to God' that she would survive, the trial heard. March 8: A former girlfriend who claims Pistorius dumped her for Miss Steenkamp testifies that he once shot at a traffic light because he was furious that a police officer had touched his gun. March 10: Pistorius vomits in court when a pathologist describes how he shot Miss Steenkamp with so-called cop-killer Black Talon bullets which are designed to 'expand and mushroom' to inflict maximum damage. Aftermath of the killing: This picture of Oscar Pistorius, bare-chested and covered in blood from the waist down, was taken by police shortly after the Paralympian shot Reeva Steenkamp at his home . Shocking: Blood can be seen down the athlete's left arm and on his shorts apparently from when he carried his dead girlfriend down the stairs after shooting her in the bathroom . March 11: A friend tells the judge that the Paralympian has a 'big love' of weapons and recalls the time the athlete laughed after allegedly firing his gun out of the sunroof of a car. March 12: A forensic analyst stages a dramatic courtroom reconstruction of the moment Pistorius broke down the toilet door with a cricket bat after shooting Miss Steenkamp. Police colonel Johannes Vermeulen argued that Pistorius was on his stumps at the time, contradicting the Paralympian's assertion that he was wearing his prosthetic legs. March 13: Horrific pictures following the trail of blood through Pistorius's house are shown at the trial - including one of his girlfriend's corpse that made the athlete throw up in the dock. The image of Miss Steenkamp's blood-covered body was accidentally shown while the prosecution was showing other images including the cocked 9mm pistol used to kill the model. March 14: Dramatic pictures are shown to the court of a bare-chested Pistorius with blood all over his shorts and prosthetic legs shortly after killing his model girlfriend. March 17: A gun licenser testifies that Pistorius was in the process of buying seven guns - three shotguns, two revolvers, semi-automatic assault rifle and another self-loading rifle - at the time he killed his girlfriend. The order, which came to $5,000 (£3,000), was cancelled a month after the shooting. Earlier, the court heard the double-amputee had a 'great love and enthusiasm' for guns and once went into full 'combat mode' after hearing a possible intruder at his home. The noise turned out to be a washing machine. Pistorius had also passed self-defence tests that stated you shouldn't fire unless you knew what you are shooting at and what lay behind the target, the trial heard. Key evidence: Forensic analyst Colonel Johannes Vermeulen stands in front of the toilet door through which Oscar Pistorius shot Reeva Steenkamp while holding the cricket bat the athlete then used to break it down . March 19: The trial is told that Pistorius looked at porn and car websites the night before he killed Miss Steenkamp. He breaks down in the dock as a ballistics expert tells Pretoria's High Court that Miss Steenkamp was struck in the hip by the first bullet, then fell back on to a magazine holder by the toilet. She was then hit by another two bullets which struck her in the right arm and her skull as she crossed her arms over her head to protect herself. March 20: It is revealed by the runner's lawyer that he has been forced to sell the luxury villa where he shot Miss Steenkamp to raise money to pay for his legal bills. March 24: The court hears how the 29-year-old model admitted to being scared of the South African track star in text messages sent less than three weeks before her death. One of them read: 'I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me'. A later text said: 'I can’t be attacked by outsider for dating u and be attacked by you the person I deserve protection from.' March 25: A selfie of Miss Steenkamp blowing a kiss which she sent to Pistorius weeks before he killed her is shown to the court. March 28: Trial is adjourned until April 7 after one of the judge's two assessors is taken ill in hospital.","Photographs show the blood soaked bathroom in his villa in Pretoria .

"While most head chefs take a decade refining their culinary skills, Andrew Duff has scaled the career ladder faster than most and become Scotland's youngest head chef - at the tender age of 16. Andrew, who has been cooking since he was 12, has wowed diners since taking over the kitchen at an Edinburgh gastropub earlier this month. The culinary whizzkid now has dreams of owning his own restaurant - and becoming the youngest person to be awarded a Michelin star. Sixteen-year-old Andrew Duff is now  the youngest head chef in Britain, working at Mackenzie's Bar in the Davidson's Mains area of Edinburgh . Andrew has always enjoyed dabbling in the kitchen, first baking with his father as a child before making his first meal at the age of 12 . He said: 'I want to build up my experience and I want to be the youngest chef to get a Michelin star. 'It's a big task but once college is done I could get another job and work my way up. 'I've always wanted to own my own restaurant. I've always been a fan of Jamie Oliver. He has a restaurant in Edinburgh. Andrew now splits his time between college in the mornings and working at the restaurant from 3-9pm . 'After eating there I decided I wanted to be a chef and maybe be as big as him.' The teenager did a one-month trial at Mackenzie's Bar in Davidson's Mains, in the north west of Edinburgh, last August before starting a professional cookery course at Edinburgh College. When the former head chef quit earlier this month, Andrew's dad Darren suggested to owner Brian Haston and his manager wife Karen that they take the teenager on. They agreed - and have been 'delighted' with their decision ever since. Andrew's ambition is to own his own restaurant and be as sucessful as Jamie Oliver . Andrew has always enjoyed dabbling in the kitchen, first baking with his father as a child before making his first meal at the age of 12 - spaghetti bolognese. He said: 'I got the opportunity to be the head chef if I wanted. The other guy left and they were looking for a new one. 'It's quite a busy restaurant. I'm only in college from 8am until 2pm then work from 3pm until 9pm during the week. 'It's quite a lot of work but in the end I think it will be worth it. It's only a pub but we serve up to 200 people at the weekend. 'I've never had any complaints about my food and all my family love my cooking. 'My lecturers say I have great inspiration and I could do well if I knuckle down and carry on with it.' Andrew's signature dish is a chicken korma curry, which impressed his boss so much it was put on the pub's menu. Pub manager Karen Haston said: 'His curry is totally amazing. He's very keen so I think that helps. I think for his age his cooking is really good. 'He's so laid back. We had 158 customers at the weekend and he never blinked. 'In the future he's going to be up there with the best.' Andrew dethrones Welsh chef Luke Thomas, who emerged as Britain's youngest head chef at the age of 18 two years ago. Luke has since opened his own bistro in the Cotswolds and starred in a BBC documentary.

"A new morning TV battle got underway today as ITV launched Good Morning Britain - and while there was initial dismay at Susanna Reid's legs being hidden behind a desk, one media commentator believes the BBC should be worried about its latest rival to Breakfast. Good Morning Britain's predecessor, Daybreak, was viewed by roughly half the number of people that tuned into BBC Breakfast, so ITV has a lot of ground to make up. But media analyst Steve Hewlett believes it stands a fighting chance of succeeding, not least because of its poaching of Ms Reid from Breakfast. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Line-up: The four presenters kicked off the show from behind the desk, before moving around the studio later in the programme . Spot the difference: The studio and the layout is incredibly similar to that of Good Morning America . Twitter storm: Many people took to social media sites to voice their discontent about Good Morning Britain looking similar to Good Morning America . 6am to 6.25am - Breezy banter and round-up of the day's news . 6.25 - A One Direction segment . 6.30 - Andi Peters appears at a market stall in Leeds with a 'wheel of money' competition . 6.40 - A picture of Ben Shephard in Speedos . 6.58 - Richard Arnold with a One Direction video exclusive . 7.15 - Susanna Reid interviews a government minister about jobseekers benefits . 7.35 - Andi Peters' Wheel of Cash hands out £50 to a man at Leeds market . 8.30 - Paul O'Grady interview . He told . MailOnline: 'This is a major throw of the dice - there's a new . production team and new presenters. It's a major move, but on paper it . stands every chance of working. Susanna Reid is a great booking. 'The question is whether Good Morning Britain gets to know its audience and whether it gets the right tone.' Mr Hewlett said that arrogance was the cause of Daybreak's failure. He said: 'With Daybreak corporate hubris took over at ITV. In one fell swoop they demonstrated everything that can go wrong in one show. They hired Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, an amazing partnership on The One Show, but transplanting chemistry from one place to another is very hard to do.' He added: 'It would be really good, not least for the BBC, if ITV manage to make a success of Good Morning Britain, because if it gets traction the BBC will be forced to react. Not having competition is not good for the viewer.' Ms Reid’s ITV debut initially drew mixed reactions, with criticism that . the show looked too similar to its U.S counterpart and that Ms Reid’s . figure was obscured by a desk. As . the show began viewers took to Twitter to complain that the legs of the . 43-year-old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £400,000 and . as much as £1million a year - were hidden from view. One . viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to . put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the . garage #gmb.' Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.' The dismay was short-lived, though, as Ms Reid, dressed in a knee-length red dress, soon moved to a sofa. Speaking recently about the desk and the new set of the show, Susanna said: 'Our set is different, fresh and it's not what people have been used to over the last couple of years in breakfast television. 'It is something new and exciting for us. We all start behind the desk, which hasn't happened for a while.' Criticism that the show’s studio and layout resembled ABC’s Good Morning America may take longer to shake off. Relief for fans: Ms Reid's legs were later on show as she and Mr Shephard interviewed Paul O'Grady . The big reveal: Susanna later moved and showed off her legs in her knee-length dress . Back for more: Old favourites including celebrity correspondent Ross King were back for the new show . One viewer wrote on Twitter: 'Good morning Britain is too formal and newsy and like an American morning show. #GMB.' While another added: 'Well, Good Morning Britain looks very American so far...suited team behind desks, tickers, huge pic takes up half screen.' Sky News anchor Kay Burley told MailOnline that she found the show - co-hosted by Ben Shephard, 39, Charlotte Hawkins, 28 and Sean Fletcher, 30 - too frantic. The presenter, who was a reporter on Good Morning Britain's distant cousin, TV-am, in 1985, said: ‘The show itself is just too busy for me at the moment but I'm sure it'll settle down after a couple of weeks. ‘Breakfast viewers just need to know that the world is still turning, they can get to work on time and what the weather is doing...' But she added: ‘I love Susanna. I think she has all the ingredients a great presenter needs. Smart, presentable, serious when she needs to be and fun when she doesn't.’ Co-presenters: Ben Shephard, left, and Charlotte Hawkins, right, who joined ITV from Sky . As it was: Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly on Daybreak, before it was reinvented as Good Morning Britain . Monday’s viewing figures for BBC Breakfast and Good Morning Britain will be released tomorrow. On average 12.4m people watch Breakfast each week, according to the BBC. Bookmaker William Hill believes there is a fair chance Reid may not be with the show in a year's time, with even money on the presenter no longer being a host 12 months from now. Spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'You would expect the first day to be a little chaotic, but we felt the chemistry was not there and the show could struggle in its current format.' Susanna sneaked out the back of ITV's studio on the South Bank over an hour after filming finished and was driven out in a black Mercedes. She Tweeted: 'Thanks for all your tweets #GoodMorningBritain - back tomorrow at 6am.' Early arrival: Susanna was without make-up as she arrived for her first day on the show clutching her laptop and the day's papers . Sitting pretty: Susanna's previous role at BBC Breakfast saw her put on a much more leggy display .","Viewers took to Twitter to complain that Susanna Reid's legs were hidden .

"David Cameron yesterday vowed to defend the religious slaughter of animals in Britain. In a strongly pro-Jewish speech to the Israeli Knesset, Mr Cameron said he would never allow a ban on the production of kosher meat, despite a call from Britain’s leading vet for it to be replaced by more humane methods. Earlier this month, John Blackwell, president-elect of the British Veterinary Association, called for a ban on the traditional production of both kosher and halal meat. Scroll down for video . 'I back kosher': Prime Minister David Cameron told the Israeli Knesset that he will not allow a ban on the production of kosher meat, despite calls for it to be replaced by more humane methods . Traditional methods: Kosher butchers, like that pictured in Whitechapel, London, slaughter their animals in accordance with strict religious beliefs . He said the practice of slitting animals’ throats and allowing them to bleed to death caused unnecessary suffering - and suggested animals should be stunned first. Several Tory MPs have also called for a ban on a method of slaughter used to kill an estimated 600,000 animals a week in British abattoirs. But, to applause from Israeli MPs yesterday, Mr Cameron, who attempted to speak Hebrew, praised the Jewish community’s integration into British society, and said he would never allow a ban on religious slaughter, known as Schechita. He said: ‘The Jewish community has been an absolute exemplar in integrating into British life in every way but integration doesn’t mean that you have to give up things that you hold very dear in your religion. 'When people challenged kosher Shechita. I have defended it. 'I fought as a back-bench Member of Parliament against the last attempt to do something to change this. 'And there’s no way I’m allowing that to change now I’m Prime Minister. On my watch Shechita is safe in the UK.' In a speech that deliberately courted . the Jewish vote, the Prime Minister also said he had no truck with . boycotts of Israeli products, such as the Oxfam boycott on goods . produced in the Israeli settlements that saw it split with Hollywood . actress Scarlett Johansson. Applause: In yesterday's speech David Cameron praised the Jewish community¿s integration into British society, and said he would never allow a ban on religious slaughter, known as Schechita. He is pictured at a press conference with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu . No boycotts: In the strongly pro-Jewish speech Mr Cameron said: 'To those who want to boycott Israel I have a clear message. ¿Britain opposes boycotts.' While in Jerusalem the Prime Minister took part in a ceremony to honour the six-million Jews who were killed during the Holocaust at the conical shaped Hall Of Names, (pictured) Miss Johansson quit her role as an ambassador to the charity in January after it criticised her decision to advertise Soda Stream, which has a large factory in the occupied West Bank. The Prime Minister said: ‘To those who want to boycott Israel I have a clear message. ‪Britain opposes boycotts. 'Whether it’s trade unions campaigning for the exclusion of Israelis or universities trying to stifle academic exchange Israel’s place as a homeland for the Jewish people will never rest on hollow resolutions passed by amateur politicians.' He used Hebrew to let the people know . he 'understands', telling them: 'When I was last here in Jerusalem, I . came as Leader of the Opposition and I remember being quite bemused as I . sat listening to Israeli politicians telling me all about the . challenges of coalition politics. 'They . told me about building a coalition, keeping it together, balancing the . demands of different parties, sorting out the disputes and I just didn’t . understand this strange system of government. 'But after nearly 4 years as Prime Minister of my own coalition all I can say is: achshav ani mevin (right now, I understand).' Call for ban: John Blackwell, president-elect of the British Veterinary Association, called for a ban on the traditional production of both kosher and halal meat . Mr Cameron also pointed to Government action in banning hate preachers and foreign anti-semites from Britain. ‘I have led the fight against anti-Semitism and extremism in Britain,' he said. 'We’ve removed over 26 thousand pieces of illegal terrorist content from the internet worked with the police and with universities to stop extremists spreading their divisive messages on our university campuses and we’ve excluded more foreign preachers of hate on the basis of our strategy for preventing extremism than ever before.' The Prime Minister highlight the recent decision to ban the controversial French comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala, saying his ‘abhorrent displays of anti-Semitism have no place in a tolerant and inclusive Britain'. Dieudonne hit the headlines in Britain recently when the West Bromwich Albion striker Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches for copying his ‘Quenelle’ gesture, which is modelled on an inverted Nazi salute. Mr Cameron also pointed out that the Government had legislated to end the threat of ‘ideologically-motivated court cases against visiting Israeli politicians. In a concerted charm offensive he even mentioned the fact Jewish great-great grandfather, although he made no mention of reports that he may be descended from Moses.","Prime Minister told Israeli Knesset on his 'watch' there will be no ban on the production of kosher meat .

"A known criminal and drug user fired at Denver police last month using a gun he had hidden in his butt cheeks. Isaac Vigil, 32, was already in handcuffs and despite having been frisked three times still managed to pull out the gun and fire at officers outside District 4 Police Station in Denver, Colorado.

"For more than a century it has shown its readers exotic locations and revealed exciting cultures. But National Geographic is under attack from archaeologists for a forthcoming series on its television channel about excavating war graves on the Eastern Front from the Second World War. Called ‘Nazi War Diggers’, the programme is due to be screened in the UK on May 13, and is billed as ‘three war diggers racing against time to save this history from being looted or lost’. Controversial: One of the diggers retrieves a bone from  a grave in Latvia's Courland Peninsula . A gruesome preview video appears on the channel’s website, which shows the presenters extracting various body parts from a muddy grave in Latvia. At one point, the men mistake a leg bone for an arm bone after wrenching it from the ground. According to Dr Tony Pollard, the Director of the Centre for Battlefield Archaeology at Glasgow University, the show is a ‘disgrace’. ‘I’m appalled that a major broadcaster has sunk to the levels of exploitation television,’ he said. ‘I’ve been at the forefront of battlefield archaeology for fifteen years, and I have spent much time getting the subject taken seriously. 'This just looks like they’ve gone around digging up bodies, because TV likes a dead body.’ Dr Pollard regards the way in which the programme’s presenters handle human remains as being particularly insensitive. 'Disgrace': The presenters pose over the remains of a soldier who would have died fighting on the Eastern Front . ‘This shows no evidence of even the most basic archaeological principles - this is treasure hunting not archaeology. 'I have seen human remains brandished like trophies before but in dodgy youtube videos. The fact that this comes from a commissioned TV series is quite beyond belief. ‘The trailer on the internet was absolutely shocking, and very damaging for National Geographic.’ The programme has been commissioned by the satellite channel from the same company that made Sex Box - the controversial feature aired on Channel 4 in October where couples had sex in a sound-proofed box before being interviewed about the experience in front of an audience. Remains: One of the hosts looks at the skull of a former soldier . Dozens of archaeologists have left comments on the National Geographic website, lambasting the channel for what they see as a grotesquely insensitive intrusion into a gravesite. ‘You are sensationalizing and promoting the looting of archaeological sites and the disrespect of human remains,’ wrote Shannon Boomgarden of the Natural History Museum of Utah. ‘You should be ashamed to profit off these destructive activities disguised as “science”.’ Dr Sam Hardy of University College, London, who specialises in research into the illegal antiquities trade, is incensed at what he has seen. ‘Based on the preview video, the Nazi War Diggers didn’t record their finds properly,’ he said. ‘They didn’t take out the material carefully. To me, it looks untrained and unsupervised. If I tried to excavate a skeleton like that on a dig I would have been stopped and thrown off the site. It’s slapdash and it destroys evidence.’ Background: The programme claims the 'war diggers' are 'racing against time to save this history from being looted or lost' ‘If this is representative of their work, then they’ve probably violated European conventions concerning the protection of archaeological heritage.’ Dr Pollard is also concerned that Nazi War Diggers will condone a disturbing trade in Nazi relics. ‘The net result of this is that more and more of these human remains will be unnecessarily disturbed,” he says, “by those looking for items to sell.’ One of the programme’s presenters, Craig Gottlieb, is a dealer in Nazi memorabilia, and who is quoted on the National Geographic site as saying: ‘I feel that by selling things that are Nazi related and for lots of money, I’m preserving a part of history that museums don’t want to bother with.’ Such comments have only inflamed the archaeological community, who believe that Nazi War Diggers is little more than looting. Yesterday, National Geographic appeared to back down over the programme, and removed the video and the archaeologists’ comments from their website. They also removed the quote from Mr Gottlieb. A spokesman for National Geographic said: ‘Unfortunately, a video excerpt from our show posted on our website did not provide important context about our team’s methodology. This series operates in direct conjunction with organizations officially licensed to excavate battlefield sites and adhered to their procedures.’","Programme called 'Nazi War Diggers' has been branded a 'disgrace'

"Of all the celebrations planned for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, it is perhaps the most fitting. Stunning jewels created from the largest diamond ever found are to be collected together in public for the first time in a unique exhibition at Buckingham Palace. They include a brooch containing gems weighing 94.4 carats and 63.3 carats and another heart-shaped piece featuring an 18.8 carat jewel. Diamond Queen: Her Majesty wears the Imperial State Crown and holds the Sovereign's Sceptre, both of which contain stones cut from the Cullinan Diamond in this picture from her Coronation... Crown Jewels: The two largest cuts from the Cullinan Diamond were set into the Sovereign's Sceptre, left, and the Imperial State Crown, right . Cullinan III and IV Brooch: The third and fourth largest of the gems - a pear-shaped drop of 94.4 carats (III) and the cushion-shaped 63.3 carat IV - were originally placed by Queen Mary on her new crown in 1911. The stones were most often worn hooked together as a pendant brooch.. Cullinan VI and VII brooch: Many pieces of Royal jewellery were created to be versatile. As well as the brooch, the 11.5 carat Cullinan VI has been used in a number of pieces including a diadem. Cullinan VIII can be set with the five other numbered Cullnan stones into a radiating platinum mount . Cullinan V Brooch This heart-shaped stone weighs 18.8 carats and is mounted in a fine radiating platinum web with a scrolling millegrain and pave-set border of brilliant diamonds. The mounting of the jewel was designed to be as adaptable as possible and was most often worn by Queen Mary (and now by The Queen) as a brooch.It also forms the detachable centre section of the diamond and emerald stomacher made for Queen Mary for the Delhi Durbar in 1911 and has been worn suspended from the Cullinan VIII Brooch . All the items – worn regularly by the Queen over the past six decades – use gems cut from the incomparable Cullinan Diamond. And the priceless collection’s history is all the more incredible given the history behind the stone. When the diamond was mined in 1905, it looked nothing more than a worthless crystal – so much so that the manager of the Premier mine near Pretoria, South Africa, threw it out as rubbish. It was only on closer inspection that staff were persuaded the piece of rock could be a genuine diamond. In fact it turned out to be three times larger than anything discovered before. Cullinan IX The smallest of the nine stones, weighing 4.4 carats, was set into a platinum ring for Queen Mary in 1911. The pear shape is known as a pendeloque and is mounted in an openwork 12-claw setting. It was also inherited by The Queen in 1953. Largest of its kind: A glass model replica of the Cullinan diamond in its original rough state . Precious: The diamond was also cut to produce this Cullinan III and IV Brooch, commissioned by Queen Mary in 1911, and the Delhi Durbar Necklace and Cullinan Pendant . Weighing 3,106 carats in its rough state and measuring 4in by 2.5in by 2.12in, the Cullinan – named after the chairman of the mining company, Thomas Cullinan – was also exceptional for its blue-white colour and purity. Soon after it was found, it was sent to Buckingham Palace for inspection by King Edward VII. For two years the stone remained a public wonder, but it was hard to find a buyer as there were doubts a stone so big could ever be cut. Eventually, the Prime Minister of the Transvaal – then a British colony – suggested his government should acquire the Cullinan and present it to Edward VII as a token of loyalty. In 1907 the uncut stone was brought to Sandringham House in Norfolk. Dazzling collection: The Coronation necklace and earrings, worn by the Queen on her Coronation in 1953, left, and right, the South Africa necklace and bracelet, a gift from the Government of South Africa to the then Princess Elizabeth on her 21st birthday. These gems were not cut from the Cullinan diamond, but will be among those displayed at Buckingham Palace this summer . Fit for a queen: This small diamond crown, as worn by Queen Victoria for her official Diamond Jubilee portrait in 1870, will also go on display. Made by Garrard, the crown was not made from the Cullinan Diamond . ... she has worn the Imperial State Crown throughout her 60-year reign on occasions such as the state opening of parliament . 'Granny's tiara': The Queen's favourite tiara, given to her from her grandmother, Queen Mary, will be in the exhibition. Here, she is pictured wearing it in on state visits in 2011, left, and 1989, right . Passed down the generations: The Queen as a child, left, with her mother who wore the Imperial State Crown before her, and, right,  her grandmother Queen Mary who can be seen wearing one of the Cullinan Diamonds as a brooch . Cutting the stone was entrusted to the celebrated firm of IJ Asscher of Amsterdam. It was too large to be cut into a single gem, so cleaving – or sawing – was necessary. The Girls of Great Britain Tiara was a wedding present to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, later Queen Mary - the Queen’s grandmother - on behalf of the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland in 1893. Made by jewellers Garrard and originally crafted with upright pearls around the top and a bandeau base, it was altered in 1920 by Queen Mary, who replaced the pearls with diamonds and removed the base. It is one of the Queen’s favourites and is forever known as 'Granny’s tiara', being a wedding present from her grandmother in 1947. It is said to be very light and easy to wear. The first blow broke the knife and the diamond remained intact. A second attempt split it in two. Eight months of grinding and polishing followed, with the result of  nine principal numbered stones, 96 small brilliants and nine carats of unpolished fragments. The total weight of the gems cut from the Cullinan was 1,055.8 carats. In 1909 the two largest gems – the biggest colourless and flawless cut diamonds in the world – were formally presented to King Edward VII at Windsor Castle and were eventually set at the head of the Sovereign’s Sceptre and in the Imperial State Crown. Both are on display at the Tower of London and will not be in the new exhibition. The other seven were mounted for Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary – the King’s wife and daughter-in-law – to create some of the most dazzling pieces of jewellery in the royal collection. Now those jewels are to be shown together for the first time. The seven stones are contained in five pieces of jewellery. A brooch containing two stones – the 94.4 carat Cullinan III and 63.3 carat Cullinan IV; a second heart-shaped brooch containing Cullinan V, which weighs 18.8 carats; the Delhi Durbar necklace from which Cullinan VII hangs in a pendant; a third brooch containing Cullinan VI and Cullinan VIII; and a platinum ring featuring the smallest of the nine stones, 4.4 carat Cullinan IX. Experts said last night that the value of the Cullinan Diamond was impossible to calculate as there has never been a gem like it in terms of size, clarity and colour. The jewellery made from it is equally ‘priceless’, not least due to its impeccable royal provenance. However, based on a 250 carat diamond that is currently for sale at an estimated £500,000 per carat, the jewellery could be worth anything from £78million for the Cullinan III and IV brooch, £9.4million for the Cullinan V brooch, £4.4million for  the Cullinan VII, £5.7million for the Cullinan VI and VIII and £2.2million for the Cullinan IX. Prince William has confided how he found out that you ‘don’t mess’ with the Queen. The prince makes the remark in an interview with US broadcaster ABC to be shown to mark the Jubilee. ‘As I learnt from growing up, you don’t mess with your grandmother,’ he said. History in the making: Joseph Asscher makes the first cut into the Cullinan Diamond in February 1908 - the first blow broke the knife . The Cullinan Diamond, which weighed 3,106 carats in its rough state, was first discovered in 1905 at a mine near Pretoria in South Africa. It was so large that its finders thought it must be crystal so threw it away. When its worth was realised, it was recovered and sent to London to be inspected by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace. For two years it remained unsold as it was thought to be too big to cut. In 1907, the Prime Minister of the Transvaal suggested that his government should acquire the Cullinan and present it to King Edward VII as a gift. Under police protection, the uncut stone was conveyed to Sandringham House in Norfolk, where the King was celebrating his 66th birthday. The task of cutting the stone was entrusted to the celebrated firm of IJ Asscher of Amsterdam. After weeks of consideration, including four days spent making the groove into which the steel cleaving knife was to be inserted, the stone was ready to be split - but the first blow broke the knife. Once cut, grinding and polishing followed, with three polishers working 14 hours a day. Eventually, they produced nine principal numbered stones, 96 small brilliants and nine carats of unpolished fragments. In 1909, the two largest gems were formally presented to King Edward VII at Windsor Castle. These are the two largest colourless and flawless cut diamonds in the world. The biggest - the Great Star of Africa - was set in the Sovereign’s Sceptre and the second gem - the Second Star of Africa - was set in the Imperial State Crown. Both are on now display at the Tower of London. The other seven were all mounted by Garrard’s or Carrington’s in a brooches, a ring and a necklace and have been worn by members of the royal family on state occasions. In 2012, seven of the nine stones will go on display in Buckingham Palace in a special exhibition to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee . The Diamonds: A Jubilee Celebration exhibition will be held from June 30 to July 8 and from July 31 to October 7 .","The Cullinan Diamond, weighing 3,106 carats in its rough state, was first discovered in 1905 at a mine near Pretoria in South Africa .

"Police have rounded up 18 operators of a prostitution ring being run in New York City because they were selling 'party packs' of cocaine and sex to high-end clients ahead of the Super Bowl. Surveillance shows the ring laundered money and credit cards through clothing, wig, beauty supply and limousine businesses and targeted wealthy out-of-town customers, especially during large events. Prostitutes would bring cocaine to clients who ordered the so-called party packs. Scroll Down for Video . Naming names: Attorney General Eric Schneiderman showed the credit card and a poster with pictures of the prostitutes who took part in the 'party pack' deals where they sold and delivered both sex and drugs . Leaving a trail: The operators of the ring sent texts to frequent clients . The text sent 10 days before the Super Bowl says 'new sexy & beautiful girls R in town waiting for u'. Officials say the arrests follow an 11-month investigation by state and city authorities- including undercover police officers- and was spearheaded by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's Organized Crime Task Force. 'These criminals utilized apartments in residential buildings as a way of carrying out their illicit activities,' police commissioner Bill Bratton said in a statement released by the Attorney General's office. 'They disregarded the safety and well-being of every member in those communities by providing a ‘one-stop shopping’ drug and prostitution ring.' Names and faces: Aside from two men at the center of the scandal, most of the others involved were women . The 18 people that were arrested are now facing various charges, including money laundering, promoting prostitution, narcotics sales, and conspiracy. The organizers would charge the 'johns' by covering their tracks and charging them through front businesses like a wig wholesaler and limousine service. They would charge the men on their credit cards, and sometimes the drugs were billed in an equivalent number of 'hours' of prostitution services. Rounding them up: Schneiderman and NYPD chief of department Philip Banks display posters with pictures of those involved, all 18 of whom have been arrested . Rounding them up: 18 people who operated a prostitution and drug dealing ring have been arrested in New York City after a nearly year-long investigation . The raids took place late Wednesday and early Thursday and the ring operators were brought in and processed at the 7th precinct in Manhattan's Lower East Side. The New York Daily News reports that some of the operators took advantage of the 'johns' willingness to meet with the prostitutes by sending multiple women to each client at each time. That trick landed a number of the men with billings for single sessions that cost upwards of $10,000. Aside from the texts to known clients, the operators also allegedly used commercials on public access television and internet ads to appeal to out-of-towners. 'Drug trafficking and prostitution are a . scourge on communities across our state,' Attorney General Schneiderman . said in a statement. Center of it all: A number of busts have been made throughout the city, including one Wednesday night that took place just blocks from the area in Times Square that is being called Super Bowl Boulevard . Arrested: A second prostitution bust came Wednesday night as police arrested four alleged prostitutes and one man just blocks from Super Bowl Boulevard . 'My office will continue to work with our partners in law enforcement on multi-agency investigations like this one to take down networks of criminals who exploit women and poison our communities for profit.' This ring is just one of many prostitution busts that have taken place in New York ahead of the big football game, as The New York Times reports that 298-prostitution arrests were reported from the first of this month through the 16th. That marks a 30 per cent increase from that same time period last year. One such bust took place, according to ABC 7, at an apartment building on 6th Avenue and 37th Street- very close to . the area designated 'Super Bowl Boulevard'- served as one of the bases . of operations. Five people were arrested in the building, four of whom allegedly appeared to be prostitutes.","Attorney General's office announced massive prostitution ring bust that led to the arrest of 18 'operators' after investigation that spanned 11 months .

But despite having millionaire parents . and royal relations, just like the Duchess of Cambridge, Pippa is a champion of the high street as proven by her recent outfit choice whilst visiting her sister in hospital. Royal seal of approval: Pippa Middleton wore her beige Superdry coat whilst visiting her sister Kate in hospital yesterday . Pippa was spotted in a beige, belted Superdry coat during her visit to the hospital with brother James yesterday afternoon. Fashion fans were so desperate to emulate her style that the £124.99 classic mac went on to sell out online overnight. And it seems that Pippa isn't the brand's only famous fan. Both Tulisa and Nicole Scherzinger gave the brand some X Factor when they stepped out in it in recent weeks and even boy band Union J looked dapper in Superdry suits on the show. Tulisa, known for her urban style, was spotted in a classic white Superdry hoody while glamorous Nicole opted for a checked skirt by the brand. The X Factor: Nicole Scherzinger and Tulisa have both sported the brand . Boy band fans: X Factor groups Union J and JLS are also big fans of the label . Fashion savvy pregnant Fearne Cotton is also a huge fan and wrapped up warm in their tassel cardigan whilst out and about in London, an item also favoured by The Only Way is Essex's Lydia Bright. Pippa's beige coat is still available in stores and a black version online. When David Beckham stepped out in a Brad . leather jacket by Superdry, it sold 70,000 from 2007 to mid-2009, becoming a . best-seller for the company. The Only Way is Superdry: TOWIE star Lydia Bright has been spotted donning the tassel cardigan and even Carol Vorderman is a fan . Although Pippa's beige mac is no longer listed on Superdry's website, a similar . version - the vintage city mac- is priced at £139.99. And it isn't the first time that Pippa has sported the brand, she wore a pair of their vibrant pink jeans back in January which she teamed with ankle boots, checked shirt and classic black blazer. Big fan: It isn't the first time that Pippa has worn the brand, she stepped out earlier this year in pink jeans by the label . Sell out: When David Beckham donned a Superdry Tshirt in his calendar, it went on to become a best seller . Flew off the online rails: While Pippa's coat is sold out on the website, a black version retails for £139.99 . Superdry is owned by SuperGroup which was established by Julian Dunkerton as 'Cult Clothing' in Cheltenham back in 1985. Superdry's distinctive designs, which combine Americana with . Japanese-style graphics and British tailored fits, have led some to . believe we're a Japanese clothing label. But although the Superdry . graphics may look Japanese, the label's origins are very much . home-grown. The first Superdry store opened in Covent Garden in London in 2004. The business enetered the London Stock Exchange in 2010 and owner Dunkerton was featured on the Sunday Times Rich List in 2012, said to be worth an estimated £180m. 2012 wasn't a good year for the brand, which issued profit warnings with store opening under review in February. Winter warmers: The cold weather has boosted Superdry sales . However, the recent cold snap has boosted . sales of hoodies, jackets and warm winter clothing at rapidly expanding . fashion chain SuperGroup. Chief executive . Julian Dunkerton credited the weather and benefits of a new team, who . had just ‘bedded in’, for the 3.9 per cent rise in underlying sales for . the 26 weeks to October 28. The entrepreneurial boss sounded a . cautious note about future trading saying: ‘Whilst mindful of a . competitive Christmas trading season ahead, the group is on track to . deliver a profit figure in-line with market expectations for the full . year. Whilst I am pleased with the progress that the new team is making . there remains much to do.’","Pippa wore £124.99 Superdry beige coat to visit sister Kate in hospital yesterday .

"Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to rescue Ravel Morrison from his West Ham hell. The Bluebirds have opened talks with the Hammers over a move for the controversial England Under-21 star. It is understood the Championship side have made an informal offer for Morrison. The forward has been at the centre of controversy over the past week. He was remanded in custody over an alleged assault on his ex-girlfriend and her mother in Manchester last week. Court: Any deal could be scuppered by the West Ham midfielder's ongoing court case . And Cardiff's interest could yet be scuppered over his ongoing court case. Nevertheless, Solskjaer still remains keen on taking the talented forward next season. Morrison's future at Upton Park is unclear, with manager Sam Allardyce and the board appearing to be at odds over the forward. Allardyce has publicly stated that Morrison is unlikely to feature in his plans next season, while co-owner David Sullivan insists the former Manchester United man remains central to the Hammers. However, it is understood the Hammers will give serious consideration to a formal offer from Cardiff. Solskjaer believes he is the man who can finally coax the best out of Morrison. The pair worked together during Solksjaer term as United's reserve team manager, so the Cardiff boss knows first hand Morrison's huge potential.

"When Anya Hindmarch transformed her London Fashion Week catwalk-turned-conveyor-belt into supermarket sweep with dancing salesmen and household essentials emblazoned on to handbags, the fashion world could barely contain its excitement. Anya's Georgiana clutches, . made from soft chalk goatskin, carried logos from washing . detergent packaging, cereal boxes, biscuit packets, and even Swan matches. And it seems that having Tony The Tiger on your tote is the hottest trend for the coming season, because the entire collection has sold out and there's already a waiting list. Scroll down for video . They're greeeeeat! Anya Hindmarch's AW14 accessories range, seen here for the first time at her AW14 show in London in February, is already sold out with a hefty waiting list . Good enough to eat (or smoke): The British designer's handbags have been emblazoned with Kellogg's cereals and even Swan matches packets . Despite many of the bags going on sale for more than £1,000 on Anya's website, there is a message under each of the totes that reads: 'Sorry, this item is currently out of stock, but if you join the waiting list we'll let you know as soon as it's back.' A Rich Tea clutch is £895, while a Frosties maxi featherweight ebury will set you back £1,350. Speaking about the coveted range at her AW14 show, Anya said: 'This collection began with the idea of finding beauty in the banal. 'The vivid ""pop"" graphics of a washing powder box or the guilty pleasure of the humble chocolate digestive. 'I wanted to treat the everyday ordinary in an extraordinary way.' Join the queue: The entirety of Anya's range, including this £1,350 Frosties Maxi Featherweight Ebury, has sold out on the designer's website and has a waiting list . Breakfast chic: For AW14, Anya's Georgiana clutches, which were made from soft chalk goatskin, were hilariously inspired by cereal boxes . Speaking about her dramatic show, which had front row regulars Poppy Delevingne and Olivia Palermo in fits of giggles, Anya said: 'The supermarket conveyor belts are a playful take on those small unforeseen events that can change your life: a sliding doors moment and the luck of a chance encounter, passing someone in the airport for a moment or a door opening to reveal the unexpected. 'It's about celebrating the small things and seizing the moment to ""get happy"",' she said. Fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Nostalgia is officially in! And it's not just 90's fashion that's back and enjoying another resurgence, it's iconic household packaging too. 'Anya Hindmarch seriously knows how to grab the nation's heart and attention. This collection of bags, with their nod to 90's cereal and washing powder boxes, resonates with at least three generations, hence why Anya is now a sell out. 'You find yourself saying: ""Ahhh, I remember that!"" We all love Tony the Tiger, the Corn Flakes rooster is a bird that will forever be remembered, the yellow of the Coco Pops box brings back childhood sugar rush memories and who doesn't feel like they can eat a whole packet of Ginger Nuts? The fact that Anya has rendered all of these in leather is pure genius. 'Talk about capturing the zeitgeist! Who ever thought cereal could be so chic? Certainly not Kellogg's! To take something so ""everyday"" and turn it into fashion is a hard feat to pull off, and even though these bags are still uber novelty, Anya has managed to do it. And sell out too.' That's handy! Peckish this afternoon? No worries, just grab a biscuit from your bag . All white: One of the handbags features a red, blue and white Daz washing detergent box . Hindmarch's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy. Noting that drawstring leather duffles were popular, she borrowed £600 to import some to England and quickly sold 500, with a little help from Harper's Bazaar - then called Harpers & Queen. A year later she had opened her first shop in Hackney. Fast-forward 25 years, and Anya now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans. Sorry, Cara. It looks like your new Mulberry totes have been knocked off the season's most coveted list.

"With temperatures predicted to fall below zero during Super Bowl Sunday, you can easily forgive Broncos and Seahawks players taking time out of their pre-match preparations to work on techniques for tackling the cold. Super Bowl XLVIII, which will be played in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, is likely to be among the chilliest events in NFL history, with the ongoing Arctic front hitting the U.S.'s north eastern coast likely to send temperatures plummeting to around -2C by the time the teams kick off at 6.30pm. With the cold weather likely to have a major impact on the game, it's little surprise that both teams are turning to technology, including expensive heated benches, to ensure the low temperatures don't get the best of their star players. Scroll down for video . Getting used to the conditions: Denver Broncos guard Chris Kuper joins teammates during a Super Bowl warm up session at the New York Training Centre in Florham Park, New Jersey . Under cover: Workers driving small tractors plow snow off a tarp covering the field at MetLife Stadium ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl XLVIII. A large tent is protecting the end zone area . With the cold weather likely to have a major impact on the game, it's little surprise both teams are desperately trying to ensure the low temperatures don't get the best of their star players . Working out exactly how the Seahawks and Broncos plan to thwart the cold depends on who you ask. Seahawks backup quarterback Tarvaris Jackson recalled asking teammates for advice about handling the temperature during his NFL debut as a rookie with the Minnesota Vikings. The game was at Chicago in December 2006, and the wind chill put the temperature around -17. Daytime high temperatures at the MetLife Stadium will be 38F (3C), while the low will be 32F (0C) 'A lot of the guys were like, 'When it gets that cold, there's nothing you can do,' Jackson said. Although Super Bowl XLVIII is unlikely to see temperatures dropping anywhere close to that low, a number of techniques picked up by players during rookie matches in the extreme cold are almost certain to be on display. Tubs of Vaseline and long-sleeves shirts are two essential items in the battle to keep warm. By rubbing Vaseline on their arms, players create a layer of insulation that fills their pores and braces them against the wind. Broncos safety David Bruton finds another benefit, too: 'When it's cold and your skin's dry [and you get] a scrape on the helmet, next thing you know, you're bleeding profusely. Just because your skin is so dry, it's easier to get cut. That lotion helps.' His teammate, kick returner Trindon Holliday, disagrees: 'I don't use those kinds of things. (The key is) basically just keeping your mind off the cold.' Although long-sleeves are outwardly a . fairly obvious solution, wearing an undershirt beneath their team . jersey is something few players are willing to consider. Denver safety Duke Ihenacho was among many who said they definitely wouldn't wear one, no matter how cold it gets: . Preparation: Both Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks (left) and Knowshon Moreno of the Denver Broncos (right) have been training in the cold of New Jersey before Sunday's big Super Bowl XLVIII clash . Drift: Snow is still piled high outside the main entrance to MetLife Stadium. Temperatures may hit as low as -2 during Sunday's Super Bowl clash . Cold job: Workers shovel snow off the seating area at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey as crews were tasked with removing snow ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl XLVIII . He said: 'I feel like having sleeves is like wearing a sweater. Makes me feel too heavy.' One key piece of kit that definitely separates the amateur circuit from the big leagues are heated benches. Both sidelines will have 70 feet of heated benches that can be . turned up by each team to its desired temperature - up to 90 degrees . hotter than the air, the NFL said. Denver Broncos safety Michael Huff is one player keen to seek out a spot. He said: 'Once you're in the . game and running around, the adrenaline's flowing, you're fine. When you . come to the sideline is when you really know it's cold outside. So I . use the heated benches.' Seattle center Max Unger will stay away from the benches however, saying: 'I try not to get too warm . on the sideline. It's kind of a happy medium, I guess... [But] I don't like it to be too much of a shock when . you get back out there on the field.' In warmer times: Super Bowl organisers are hoping to have the famous MetLife stadium and its surrounding areas free of snow by the time the teams kick off on Sunday . Super Bowl XLVIII will be played in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. It is likely to be among the coldest matches in NFL history, with the ongoing Arctic front continue to chill the U.S.'s north eastern coast . Another high-tech technique for keeping warm during the match will be giant Tornado space heaters that are  placed along each sideline when it gets cold. Players often can be seen huddling around, getting a bit of warm air. Seattle's defensive end Cliff Avril loves them, saying: 'We'll be fine, as long as we have ... those heaters out there.' Denver tight end Jacob Tamme is not so sure, however. He said: 'I'm really a no-heater guy.' All the space heaters and temperature controlled benches in the world will make little difference to the players if they fail to follow the oldest advice in the book when it comes to keeping warm on the playing field, however. From top NFL stars to eight-year-old's playing Sunday league football, the advice is simple: keep moving. Movement gets blood circulating around the body, stopping your body temperature falling as dramatically as it would if you were standing still. So as the temperature in New Jersey plummets late on Sunday afternoon, expect to see plenty of not-in-play players doing lunges and star-jumps in the corner of your television screen.","Daytime temperatures before Sunday's Super Bowl are predicted to be 3C .

"Cheerios is bringing back its famous interracial family for a Super Bowl ad in the cereal's first spot during the game in eight years. The General Mills cereal company stirred controversy when they released the ad last year featuring bi-racial actress Grace Colbert, prompting the company to permanently disable comments on the video's YouTube page after several racist reactions. But overall the ad was extremely successful and most came out to defend Cheerios' depiction of a diverse American family. As of Wednesday the original ad had garnered over 74,000 likes on YouTube compared to less than 3,000 dislikes. Scroll down for video . She's back: Child actress Grace Colbert will star in a second Cheerios ad at this year's Super Bowl. This latest ad has her talking to her dad about getting a new baby brother . Precocious: After learning that she's getting a new baby brother, Grace gets her dad to agree to getting her a dog . The first ad shows little Grace going up to her white mom seated at the kitchen table, asking her if Cheerios are really good for your heart. Her mom says the whole grains can help lower cholesterol and Grace shuffles away mischievously. The next shot shows her black dad waking up from a nap on the couch with a mound of cereal on his chest. In the new ad released Tuesday, Grace is at the table with Dad this time as he explains (using Cheerios of course) how she will soon be getting a baby brother. The precocious little girl uses the Cheerios like chips and raises her father's one baby to a dog as well and he agrees.

'Our new Cheerios ad celebrates one of those special moments in a family that America fell in love with. The ad quietly celebrates the emotional sharing and simple joys we find when spending just a few simple moments together every day.' Some criticized the ad and it's sequel because they believe General Mills is exploiting race to sell cereal. But Peter Moore Smith, the executive creative director at Saatchi & Saatchi, the ad agency that produced the commercial, doesn't agree.

"A father who suffers from ‘Tourettes and ADHD’ has admitted killing his two-month-old baby daughter ‘after losing control’. Tyler Vallance, 21, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his daughter Isabella at Worcester Crown Court today after a charge of murder was put to him. He also entered a guilty plea to section 20 wounding, after the prosecution brought a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Tyler Vallance, 21, (left) pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his daughter Isabella (together left and right) at Worcester Crown Court today after a charge of murder was put to him. The baby girl died in December 2012 . Isabella was allegedly injured at an address in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire between October 5 and December 8. She was taken to Alexandra Hospital in Redditch before being transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she died five days later. Christopher Hotton QC prosecuting said: ‘We are all of the view that we accept those pleas.’ He said the prosecution’s view was that, although there were two charges, it was ‘overwhelmingly likely that each occurred over a short period of time in a momentary loss of control by somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourettes.’ Vallance, formerly of Redditch, Worcestershire, will be sentenced at a later date. Vallance also entered a guilty plea to section 20 wounding, after the prosecution put a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to him at Worcester Crown Court (pictured) Jessica Wiggins, 19, is to be tried for an alleged offence of child cruelty between October 5 and December 8, 2012 and causing or allowing the death of her daughter Isabella.

"A bloated gym worker decided to kick his bad eating habits and get into shape after he discovered his boss was so ripped he was now entering a bodybuilding contest. Chris Monk, 26, from Shaw in Oldham, Manchester, spent every day at the gym where he worked but didn't fit in with the super-buff crowd. An avid fast food fan with long and irregular working hours, he would often pick up a McDonalds or KFC on his way home two or three times a week and also a takeaway at the weekends. Scroll down for video . Chris Monk, 26, was bloated and decided to kick his bad eating habits and get into shape . Chris tried the the Body Makeover Challenge last year. The . fitness competition, run by supplement company USN, saw Chris attempt . to improve his health and lifestyle as much as possible. While he and saw great results, he still wasn't in peak physical condition. Chris, who works in the gym . membership department for a leisure club, admits his real goal the second time around was to fine tune his aesthetics. 'The . real thing was the looks side of it. I wasn't overweight but I wasn't . in the best shape. I just thought that's how it was and I couldn't . change it. 'The six pack abs and the defined muscles you see in films seem to be something of a myth,' Chris recalls. Chris thought the six pack abs and the defined muscles you see in films were something of a myth . 'Like . so many others I accused them of using Photoshop or just made excuses . like I’ve been working all day and couldn’t train instead. 'That's until I looked at my boss [Jonny Getty], last year's winner, and realised real people can get these amazing results.' Jonny, the club's sales manager, had won the USN Body Makeover Challenge and was now preparing to compete in a bodybuilding competition. So Chris signed up again from January 6 2014 and together with Jonny started working to progress and really transform his body in just 12 weeks. And he couldn't be more delighted with the results. Breakfast: Cereal such as bran flakes . Lunch: Large portion of pasta or spaghetti bolognese . Dinner: Sausage egg and chips or another type of takeaway . Snack: crisps and chocolate . Breakfast: Egg and salmon on granary bread . Lunch: Three small portions of turkey breast cous cous and veg . Dinner: Steak with sweet potato salad, then later peanut butter on granary bread . Snacks: Nuts, yoghurt fruit . The pair trained at the gym they both work at five times a week working on cardiovascular exercises such as cycling, running, swimming, and also resistance training focussing on biceps, chest, legs, back and core. Chris even managed to squeeze in his five-a-side footy training at the weekends. That was coupled with three months of clean eating - that's ditching all that pasta, white bread and potato - and eating six small meals each day compared to his usual three large ones. Chris also bought products from USN to supplement his regime. He drank three protein shakes a day; one first thing in the morning, one after training and one just before bed; took the amino acid tablets to protect muscle breakdown and help with recovery, took the ZMA tablets and also some of the pre-workout supplements. 'Motivation was always going to be the biggest hurdle for me,' he says. 'Twelve weeks sounds like nothing, but the first seven days of changing your routine and eating patterns felt like a month. 'But I cut out excess salt saturated fat and sugar, cut out fizzy drinks the weight started falling off. 'I changed my four large meals to seven . smaller portions spaced at three-hour intervals,’ Chris explained. Chris showed off his ripped physique in Croatia, and he now gets loads of attention . 'I swapped my regular bran flakes breakfast for eggs . and salmon on granary toast, and then for lunch I would have three . small meals spread through the working day such as cous cous and . tuna, rice and turkey and a chicken salad. 'I'd sometimes have three of the same for ease. It's all about meal prep - one of the most useful tips Jonny's given me. 'I . also had a cheat meal every Saturday night, which in fact increase my . motivation and spurred me on to train harder.' After moving away from stodgy . high-carbohydrate meals towards more protein and healthier options, in . just over a month Chris could see a big difference. The Challenge saw him lose more than a stone going from his heaviest at 12st 10lbs to 11st 5lbs. Cardiovascular exercise 4-5 times a week for 30-45 minutes . such as cycling, running, swimming and outdoor fitness activities. Resistance exercise 4-5 times a week for 30-45 minutes focussing on biceps, chest, legs, back and core. He's . now reached his goal and managed to get his body fat down to 7/8 per . cent, when around Christmas it was about 15 per cent. He even managed to . drop it down to 6 per cent for a recent holiday. Chris has just . returned from a hedonistic, much-deserved break to Croatia for Hideout Festival, where he wasted no time flaunting his pecs on . the beach and at pool and boat parties. 'I'm . a lot more confident I'm absolutely happy with how I look in pictures . with my top off, especially compared to this time last year.' And Chris, who is currently single, is getting plenty of attention and admiration since his transformation. 'I'm getting more attention from everyone. In the gym its really noticeable; all my friends are asking for diet advice. 'My housemate, who isn't ripped, saw my results and signed up to the Challenge himself afterwards.' 'The idea behind the challenge is its a bit of a competition and there's an annual winner [who gets £5,000],' says Chris. While Chris didn't with the challenge overall, he has been excelling at sports and changed his life . 'You take your before picture and then weekly progress pictures and keep a diary, logging your weight and measurements week to week. Only you and the USN staff can see this, not other competitors. 'It just motivates you to stay with your clean eating and training.' There's an optional workout guide from the supplement company which can assist with the challenge. It embraces both cardiovascular and resistance weight training for around 4-5 times per week and consists of a lean muscle gain diet plan aimed at improving weight loss and increasing toned, lean muscle tissue. 'Since the challenge has finished, I’ve continued to train at the same intensity to give me the results that I have always wanted,' says Chris . ‘I encourage anyone that has struggled to achieve their goals in the past to set themselves the challenge and I guarantee they will be amazed by their own before and after pictures - just like me.'","Chris Monk, 26, from Shaw, Manchester, works at a gym but didn't fit in .

"While some models have been known to eat nothing but cotton wool balls, America's Next Top Model winner Whitney Thompson has always been vocal about her love of food. Now the 26-year-old is going to pass on her passion for delicious dishes by opening her own restaurant with her fiance, Ian Forrester. The pair will serve up meals and cocktails at their eatery in Springfield, Tennessee, which they are currently renovating ahead of a grand opening. Hot property: Plus size model Whitney Thompson has fronted campaigns for Forever 21 and lingerie company Panache since winning America's Next Top Model . New venture: The size 16 model is now opening her own restaurant . Plus size model Whitney told SLiNK magazine how the venture came about in her a new column, Whitney's World, that she's writing for their free-to-download app. She said: 'Ian and I have always loved cooking. We . loved to bake cakes in high school and bring them in every day. We were . actually house shopping when we saw the building available. It was a . whiskey saloon in 1838 and it still has the original exposed brick . inside. It just felt like fate, and I try to never let opportunities . like that pass me by.' Weathered the storm: Whitney has had to deal with being called a 'fat cow' and 'huge' Role model: Whitney says she won't bow to pressure to slim down and will carry on eating - and making - the foods she loves . She explained how Ian will be in charge in the kitchen, rustling up dishes such as  andouille crusted tilapia with mango salsa, served over loaded mashed potatoes with a spicy beurre blanc sauce. Meanwhile, she'll do some baking and cover front of house duties. 'I'm so excited to get stuck in and get . to know customers and talk to people. Ian is amazing in the kitchen so . it made perfect sense for him to run everything in there. I think that's . the key to success, we can work together but also respect where each . other is strongest too and support each other,' she explained. Personal project: Whitney will take on a front of house duties at her restaurant in Springfield, Tennessee . Passionate about food: Her fiance Ian Forrester will rustle up treats like this strawberry tart, while they'll also serve cocktails of the day . A dress size 16, Whitney became the first plus-size model to win America's Next Top Model and has since fronted campaigns for clothing store Forever 21 and lingerie company Panache and shot a commercial with popstar Rihanna. She said she fully intends to carry on her modelling alongside working at her restaurant and planning her wedding. 'I have taken off for June, but I do have some jobs lined up for July. Don't worry I will still be modelling!' she said. But while modelling has brought Whitney some fame and fortune, it's also brought her some heart ache in the form of hate mail from people abusing her for her size. Whitney's world: The model is now writing a column for SLiNK magazine . She told MailOnline earlier this year: 'It hurts. I'll get called a fat cow . or that I am huge. People are harsh. The show is in over one hundred . countries so I get hate mail from lots of people.' However, she added that she also gets fan mail and is determined to carry on being a role model for curvy women. She insists she won't bow to pressure from the entertainment industry to become thinner because she'd rather eat and be happy. She said: 'If I want a steak and chips, I am going to eat it and when I feel like going on a run, I will. 'But . I'm never going to force myself to do that. Life is too short; I could . walk outside and get hit by a bus so I may as well eat what I want to . eat,' she explained.

"Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon remains a doubt for Friday's World Cup match against Costa Rica, and centre back Andrea Barzagli could also be missing after injury problems. Buffon twisted his left ankle and knee before the Azzurri's opening game against England and watched from the bench as Salvatore Sirigu filled in admirably for him in a 2-1 win while Barzagli has a tendinitis problem. Anything but a win for Italy in their second Group D game would send England crashing out of the World Cup, so Three Lions supporters will be praying for the fitness of the legendary Italian 'keeper and the Azzurri's first choice centre back. Getting there: Buffon trained for Italy on Thursday but is still suffering from swelling to his injured ankle . Missing link: Key defender Barzagli could be the latest player that the Italians lose to injury . Coach Cesare Prandelli said Buffon: 'had three great days of training but the ankle is still slightly swollen. If he feels good after today's training he'll play.' Barzagli was held out of training Wednesday due to a tendinitis problem that bothered him all season with Italian champions Juventus. Key duo: Buffon and Barzagli would be a couple of big misses for the Italians if they are ruled out by injury . Able deputy: Sirigu performed well in Buffon's absence and could be called upon again by Prandelli . 'Barzagli is better but we'll evaluate him tomorrow morning,' Prandelli said. If Barzagli is unable to play, Leonardo Bonucci could take over in defense alongside Giorgio Chiellini. Easy does it: Buffon saves a shot during the session but might not be back in time to face Costa Rica .","Buffon could miss second World Cup game with ankle still swollen .

"Cherie has been treating her daughter Abbey with medicinal marijuana for several months and has seen a dramatic improvement in her condition . A NSW mother who was treating her two-year-old daughter with medicinal cannabis says the child has just months to live after police raided her supplier who was dobbed in to authorities by ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher. Doctors told Cherie last year that her daughter Abbey would live only a few months as a result of CDKL5, a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes, as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities. After months of failed treatment, and on the verge of admitting Abbey to a palliative care unit, Cherie bought some liquid medical marijuana from a supplier in Canberra and snuck it into the hospital and put it into Abbey's feeding tube. The result on the two-year-old's health was extraordinary. 'The seizures were less intense, they weren't as long and she wasn't having as many of them,' Cherie told Daily Mail Australia. 'I started her on it without the knowledge of the staff at the hospital… They were quite surprised because they didn't know what was going on. The paediatrician commented on how well she was looking.' Cherie describes Abbey, who is the youngest of her six children and the only one with the rare condition, as a 'cheeky' girl. 'She loves cuddles and she loves music, she just loves attention.' But Cherie says it is likely that Abbey will die in the next few months, after her supply of medicinal cannabis dries up. Cherie has enough medicinal cannabis to last Abbey for six weeks and no prospect of getting more since her cannabis supplier was raided in February. 'Once [the cannabis] is gone the seizures will return, there's no if and buts about it, there's a big risk of death,' she said. Scroll down for video . Left: Abbey before she started on medicinal cannabis; Right: Abbey after being treated with medicinal cannabis . Abbey suffers from a rare genetic condition and has spent half of her life in hospital . Cherie found her supplier after talking to friends online who were treating their own children with medicinal cannabis for uncontrolled seizures. 'I did my own research and everything was so positive. One of my friends was giving her child medicinal cannabis, I asked if she could recommend someone.' The supplier Cherie contacted was raided earlier this year after he was dobbed in to authorities by Katy Gallagher, ACT Chief Minister. The man had regularly corresponded with Ms Gallagher about medicinal cannabis, but she reported him to police after he informed her he was administering marijuana to a child. 'I felt that there was no other alternative to me but to forward that to child protection and to police, I still think that was the right thing to do despite people raising concerns about it,' said Ms Gallagher. She added that while she had 'huge empathy' for parents trying to find ways to alleviate the suffering of their sick children, she was required to forward on the man's email to police and child services. Cherie only has a six week supply of cannabis left and no way of getting more since her supplier was raided . ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher said she had 'huge empathy' for parents wanting to treat their children, but said she was bound to report the cannabis supplier when he informed her he was supplying an illicit drug to a child . 'At the end of the day I think I have to operate within the laws that are currently in operation, which are very clear regarding marijuana and also child protection.' Ms Gallagher has received abuse and death threats on social media for the decision, with people calling her a 'robotic kid killer' a 'hypocrite' for whom 'evil is not a strong enough word' and comparing her to 'Nazi death camp guards'. '[Katy] would dob a homeless man into police for stealing bread cause stealing is illegal. Antiquated dinosaur,' wrote one person. But critics are not finding support from Cherie, who said: 'I can understand where Katy's coming from, yet she could have had more compassion regarding the situation.' The 60 Minutes TV program is airing a story on Sunday night about the fact that Australian families are being left with no choice but to break the law in order to save their children, while many families in America don’t need to go down that avenue as medicinal cannabis is legalised in some states. The report reveals that politicians, doctors and patients in Australia are shifting their thinking and there's now a green rush to legalise cannabis for medicine nationwide. Last week, governments in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania all signalled they would support law reform which would allow chronically-ill patients to take cannabis to relieve their suffering. After rejecting a medicinal cannabis trial earlier this month, the Tasmanian government has announced it would be prepared to support the findings of an Upper House inquiry into medicinal cannabis. Under a private member's bill to be introduced this month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally-ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis. The renewed push to relax the laws comes as a new poll reveals two thirds of Australian’s support the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. However, it’s unlikely there will be any change to the legislation in Victoria with the state government and the opposition admitting they have no immediate plans to legalise the drug. Earlier this month, pregnant mother of one Cassie Batten was questioned by Victorian police over the use of cannabis oil to treat her epileptic three-year-old son. Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Premier Mike Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments. Mr Baird indicated his support after meeting Daniel Haslam, a 24-year-old who in 2010 was told he would only live for a few more months. The Tamworth resident began taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease and has made vast improvements in his health. Daniel Haslam, 24, (pictured) was told in 2010 that he only had months to live but began taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease and has made vast improvements in his health . Tasmanian mum Nicole Cowles is hopeful the rising groundswell of support for the legalisation of medicinal marijuana could stop her having to obtain illegally from interstate suppliersto help the suffering of her daughter Alice Agnew, who is just eight. ‘I’m seeing Alice for who she really is – I only saw glimpses of her before,’ Ms Cowles said about the improvement of her daughter, who also suffers from CDKL5, since she started taking the liquid form of cannabis four times a day in February to help control her seizures. The family is one of 200 across the country who are forced to import the cannabis from a supplier in Kempsey in NSW which is free of charge but the waiting list is sitting at 1,500 with people desperate to get their hands on the drug to relieve chronic pain and aid with seizures.

"The BBC is planning to tell the story of Easter this year with a spectacular live show using a giant cross made from shipping containers. The hour-long flagship programme on Good Friday is aiming to appeal to non-religious viewers who are put off by church services. It will be broadcast from South Shields in Tyne and Wear and use up to 80 containers representing the Stations of the Cross. Up to 80 shipping containers will be used for the BBC's Easter spectacle - a retelling of the Easter story . The containers will be brought together to create a huge, cross-shaped installation, helping worshippers and viewers to better understand The Passion, including Christ’s trial, suffering and death. The scale of the cross, which will be . longer than St Paul's Cathedral, is intended to replicate the length of . the path trodden by Christ on the way to his crucifixion. The show, called The Great North Passion, will include a live church service and a choral performance at King's College chapel in Cambridge. Aaqil Ahmed, the corporation's head of religion, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'It is an event to mark the story for a wider audience who may not necessarily watch the actual religious services. 'The Easter services will be primarily aimed at a religious audience. We should get something for everybody in there.' For the past few years, the BBC has staged Passion plays in outside settings with the involvement of local communities. Spectacular: The Easter event will be held in Bents Park, South Shields (pictured) In 2006, actor and singer Keith Allen . played Pontius Pilate in the Manchester Passion, while in the Preston . Passion, in 2012, the role was taken by Miranda comedy star Tom Ellis. That . programme, which was presented by Fern Britton and included a . performance by Jamelia, the soul singer, was watched by more than one . million viewers. Councillor Alan . Kerr, deputy leader of South Tyneside Council, said: 'We are delighted . and proud to host this national event in South Tyneside. Aaqil Ahmed, the BBC's head of religion, is behind the event in South Shields . 'The BBC took into consideration our excellent track record in hosting and staging major events like the Great North Run and our summer festival concerts. 'The Great North Passion producers realised Bents Park is the perfect venue for such a live broadcast. 'Our experienced event staff are used to providing logistical support for major events, and the BBC were impressed by their ‘can do' attitude. 'We are already working very hard with The Cultural Spring and the BBC to ensure the Great North Passion will be a success, and it's great to think the eyes of the nation will again be on the borough for a major national event.' Among the dozens of shipping containers used for the programme will be one for each of the 14 stations of the cross, which traditionally mark the final moments before Christ's crucifixion. Before being transported to South Shields to form part of the final installation they will be placed, for about two months, in different areas across the North East to be developed into 'pieces of art'. Starting from next month, the BBC wants to transform the containers into 'contemporary original works', each reflecting the themes of individual stations of the cross. It is commissioning artists, dancers, musicians, poets and writers to take responsibility for a single container and to develop it with the involvement of local communities. The broadcaster is working with the Cultural Spring, a scheme that helps young people get involved in arts projects in Sunderland and South Tyneside. Rebecca Ball, project director for the Cultural Spring, added: 'We’re delighted to be working with the BBC on the Great North Passion; a fantastic free event in Bents Park, South Shields, that will also be enjoyed by millions on TV on Good Friday. 'The Cultural Spring was set up to ensure as many people as possible from South Tyneside and Sunderland get to see, take part in, create and enjoy great arts projects. 'What better way to launch our three-year programme than with this fantastic partnership with the BBC.'","Hour-long flagship programme aims to appeal to non-religious viewers .

"The new film about Dominique Strauss-Kahn depicts the former International Monetary Fund chief as a sex-crazed playboy, haunting orgies and chasing young women - despite the objections of his wife. A trailer, leaked online and posted by several websites, appears to be a film festival sales pitch the controversial movie starring Gerard Depardieu. Depardieu plays a 'Mr Deveraux' - modeled after the powerful French politician, who was once a front-runner to become the president of France. The very adult-themed trailer offers several scenes of Depardieu's character engaging in orgies, having sex with prostitutes and seducing young women. Recreation: Director Abel Ferrara re-imagines the infamous scene where IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of assaulting a New York City hotel maid in his new film 'Welcome to New-York' Sex-crazed: A leaked trailer shows Gérard Depardieu's character engaging in wild orgies, seducing young women and hiring prostitutes . All the while his wife, played by Jaqueline Bisset, struggles to cope with her husband's infidelities. The trailer opens with director Abel Ferrara's recreation of the alleged sex assault that brought down the mighty DSK and led to his arrest in May 2011. A woman behind a closed door screams and struggles, shouting 'No! No!' Strauss-Kahn was dramatically taken off a plane and handcuffed after a maid at the upscale Sofitel New York Hotel accused him forcing her to give him oral sex. The charges were later dropped due to inconsistencies in the maid's story to police, but the incident led to other accusations about Strauss-Kahn sexual predilections that sank his political career. The film remains controversial because the sex assault charges were never proven and prosecutors determined that they did not have enough evidence to prosecute him. That didn't stop Ferrara from imaging his own scenario for the incident at the hotel. The final scene of the trailer shows Depardieu's character wrapped in a bath towel, fresh out of the shower, when the maid approaches. Spitting image: Gerard Depardieu, left, recreates the media storm surrounding the 2011 sexual assault trial of disgraced former International Monetary Fund head Dominick Strauss-Kahn, right . Photo hounds: The re-enactment featured a throng of photographers snapping images as the fictional DSK, his wife and daughter Camille Strauss-Kahn . Smoke break: Depardieu and Bissett on the set of the DSK movie shooting in New York City . The maid looks intimidated as the man asks, 'Do you know who I am?' In an interview with Swiss Television RTS last year, Depardieu revealed he agreed to play the part because he found his fellow countryman 'arrogant and smug', adding: 'He is very French. I will do it, because I don't like him.' Depardieu will be joined on screen by  Nip/Truck actress Jacqueline Bisset, who will play DSK's ex-wife, the French TV reporter Anne Sinclair. And last month, the actors got caught . in controlled chaos as they re-enacted the media storm surrounding the . sexual assault trial, that ultimately collapsed in August 2011. The scene depicted the media frenzy . surrounding the case that was sparked when an immigrant hotel maid . accused the then-IMF chief of sexual assault after she entered his suite . to clean it. It was filmed outside the same 6,800-square-foot, $50,000-a-month Tribeca townhouse . that DSK stayed in while under house arrest as the case unfolded. Controversial: Depardieu himself is no stranger to the courts and missed a hearing earlier this month in Paris over an alleged drunken scooter incident . Media frenzy: French actor Gerard Depardieu on location as disgraced former IMF chief Dominick Strauss-Kahn and Nip/Tuck actress Jacqueline Bisset as his wife Anne Sinclair filmed a chaotic scene on Thursday in New York City . Controlled chaos: A scene from the movie showed the media frenzy surrounding the sexual assault case . But the trial collapsed in August 2011 . when prosecutors deemed the evidence of his accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, . to be unrelieble. She later filed a civil lawsuit. The film is being directed by American Abel Ferrara, whose credits include Bad Lieutenant, which starred Billy-Bob Thornton in 1992 and 1996 crime thriller The Funeral, fronted by Christopher Walken. Announcing his latest venture last year, Ferrara said it would be set in New York, Paris and Washington, adding: '[It will be set] in all spots of power in fact: it’s a film about rich and powerful people.' Depardieu himself is no stranger to the courts. Earlier this month, the Green Card actor missed a hearing in Paris over an alleged drunken scooter incident. The 64-year-old actor, who also . failed to attend court for the last hearing in January, was more than . three times over the drink-drive limit when he came off his moped near . the Champs-Elysees in Paris last November. He had been due to attend a . 'correctional tribunal' in Paris to face a charge of drink-driving, but . he did not turn up because he was filming his new role as . Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New York. Just like real life: The movie scene was filmed outside the same posh Tribeca townhouse that DSK was confined to during his house arrest . Then and now: DSK is shown leaving his Tribeca home in September 2011 surrounded by cameras . Poor wife: Jacqueline portrays DSK's wife, French TV reporter Anne Sinclair, and held onto an umbrella during the filming of a media storm scene . Sex scandal: Jacqueline's character got caught up in the international  incident that toppled DSK . A judge said the case would go ahead . in Depardieu's absence, and the Oscar-nominated star of Green Card and . Cyrano de Bergerac risked being sentenced to a maximum of two years . behind bars and a £3,500 (Euro 4,500) fine. Two years ago, Depardieu was also arrested for smashing up a car parked outside a swingers' club near his Paris home. And . he was involved in a separate scandal in France in 2011 when he . urinated in the aisle of a plane in full view of disgusted passengers. He also courted controversy in his native France this year . after moving to Belgium and taking Russian citizenship to avoid a new . 75 per cent tax rate. Real life: DSK and his wife Anne Sinclair arrive at the Manhattan Supreme Court building in New York in August 2011 . Nice bracelet: Depardieu portrays DSK while the French economist was under house arrest and forced to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts . When Depardieu announced his plans to . move abroad to avoid paying high tax rates, he was branded 'shabby and . unpatriotic' by prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. But the defiant screen legend retaliated . by declaring he would also hand back his French passport, and wrote an . angry open letter to the French government, saying: 'All those who have . left France have not been insulted as I have been.' He then told French president Francois Hollande in a personal phone call that he was 'sickened at how France spits on success'. Depardieu is one of the few French stars known throughout the world, and has made more than 100 films, many in English. He also notorious in France for his battle with alcohol and his turbulent love life. Over the past ten years he has devoted much of his time to producing wine at his Lys-de-Volan vineyard near Lyon.","Depardieu joined by Nip/Truck's Jacqueline Bisset, who plays DSK's ex-wife .

"Dementia patients and their families are being hit by a ‘care tax’ of more than £20,000 a year, research has revealed. They are forced to ‘break the bank’ to pay for extra basic help from their own pockets because it is not provided by local authorities. On top of that, relatives are having to undertake everyday tasks such as washing, feeding and dressing which often forces them to give up jobs. It is predicted there will be more than 850,000 people in the UK with Alzheimer's disease in 2015 . It is now estimated that of the £26billion a year cost of dementia to the UK, patients and their families are picking up two-thirds of the amount – about £17.4billion. The London School of Economics was commissioned by the Alzheimer’s Society to calculate the care burden – and found that the average dementia patient and their relatives are hit by a ‘tax’ of £21,322 a year. The figure includes £7,085 to pay for private carers on top of an estimated £14,237 in unpaid care provided by family members themselves. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accepted that the costs were ‘unfair’ to families and promised to provide more financial help to families. He said: ‘I want to make sure those with dementia, their families and carers get the help they need. It’s precisely because people face such unfair care costs that we are transforming the way people pay for care, capping the amount they have to pay and providing more financial help.’ Alzheimer's Society says that thousands are paying a 'dementia tax' to cover their dementia care costs . Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said it was wrong that patients had to pay for their own care when those with cancer or heart disease had care provided free by the NHS. ‘This new research exposes the staggering financial and human impact of dementia,’ he said. ‘It is plain to see that our social care system is on its knees, leaving an army of tens of thousands of unpaid carers bearing the brunt. ‘If you have cancer or heart disease you can quite rightly expect that the care you need will be free. That is just not the case for people with dementia. ‘Families are forced to break the bank to pay for basic care for a loved one.’ Problems arise because home care is not provided by the NHS but by local councils – whose budgets have been slashed, forcing many families to pick up the tab for private care themselves. By contrast, patients with heart disease or cancer are assured of free care on the NHS – because health budgets have been protected from cuts. The research also found that an estimated 225,000 people in the UK develop the condition every year – or one person every three minutes. This means that by next year, 850,000 patients will have the condition, rising to two million by 2051. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. It is predicted there will be more than 850,000 people in the UK with Alzheimer's disease in 2015. The term 'dementia' describes a set of symptoms which can include loss of memory, mood changes, and problems with communication and reasoning. These symptoms occur when the brain is damaged by certain diseases and conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia. Symptoms occur when the brain is damaged by certain diseases and conditions, including Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's disease, first described by the German neurologist Alois Alzheimer, is a physical disease affecting the brain. During the course of the disease, protein 'plaques' and 'tangles' develop in the structure of the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. People with Alzheimer's also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain. These chemicals are involved with the transmission of messages within the brain. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, which means that gradually, over time, more parts of the brain are damaged. As this happens, the symptoms become more severe.

"The father-in-law of the Syrian president urged him to respond to reports of torture made in a shocking Channel 4 documentary, leaked emails revealed yesterday. Dr Fawaz Akhras, a Harley Street cardiologist who lives in London, purportedly sent President Bashar al-Assad an  email warning him about ‘horrible’ images of atrocities which were about to be aired on British television. He suggested that the president should put out a statement saying that the torture footage would be professionally examined and those who are ‘accountable will be prosecuted’.

He is believed to have sent the email to his daughter Asmara and her husband, the president, hours before the Channel 4  documentary, called Syria’s  Torture Machine, was screened on December 19.The programme’s makers had contacted the Syrian embassy in an attempt to get an official response to the claims of mass torture they were about to screen to millions of viewers. Aware of the damage it would do to Syria’s reputation, Dr Akhras wrote in his email: ‘The description of this video is horrible and the embassy were asked to comment but no answer.’ Dr Akhras helped draft a detailed 13-point defence of the military’s actions and suggested launching a state-sponsored English-language news network.

"A new mother's cervical cancer went undiagnosed for 14 months because doctors thought the symptoms were related to her pregnancy. Shelley Maye,  from Newbury, Berkshire, had been suffering from extreme tiredness, back ache, bleeding after intercourse and sickness. But it wasn't until her baby, Jenson, was four- months-old, that the 34-year-old received the devastating news that she had advanced cervical cancer. The mother-of-two was told the disease had already spread to the surrounding tissue and a hysterectomy would no longer work as there was not enough healthy tissue to perform the operation. Scroll down for video . Shelley Maye, 34, from Newbury, Bershire, was diagnosed with cervical cancer four months after her second son, Jenson, was born . 'I don't want to die': Mrs Maye said she was terrified when she was diagnosed with cancer as she was newly married to husband Andrew and they had two young children together . After a gruelling six weeks of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and brachytherapy - where a radiation source is placed near to the cancer - Mrs Maye is now waiting to see if the treatment has worked. She said she knew something was wrong as she was experiencing symptoms that had not been present when she was pregnant with her first child. But she was reassured by professionals who she claims told her the symptoms were the result of her pregnancy. She said: 'My pregnancy was awful, I knew there was something terribly wrong. 'I suffered for fourteen months before my cervical cancer was diagnosed. 'It had already spread by that point and it destroyed our hopes of having any more children in the future. 'I was also terrified that I had passed cancer on to my baby. 'I knew the pain and bleeding after intercourse wasn't normal but when medical professionals reassure you that its pregnancy-related you trust their judgement. Unusual bleeding . In most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex. Bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period, is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the menopause (when a woman's monthly periods stop). If you have any type of unusual vaginal bleeding, visit your GP for advice. Other symptoms of cervical cancer may include: . Advanced cervical cancer: . If the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including: . Source: NHS Choices . 'I never imagined I was suffering from cervical cancer, I had never missed a single smear test.' Doctors also told Mrs Maye they had found a 7cm benign tumour on her kidney, which will be removed during an operation scheduled for later this year. She said it was terrifying being diagnosed and is on edge, waiting to find out if treatment has worked. 'I don't want to die, I have only just got married to Andrew and we have two young children together,' Mrs Maye said. 'We are all waiting for the all-clear now, my specialist has told me that the intense treatment is working but we won't know if I'm cancer free until two months time.' A healthcare professional thought Mrs Maye was suffering from the baby blues. But having been through one pregnancy already, Mrs Maye believed something else must be wrong. When she was finally given a smear test she was told by the nurse that she was bleeding internally. Three days later specialists revealed they had found abnormal cells. Mrs Maye, said: 'When I went to have my biopsy done they told me that they were 99.9 per cent sure it was cancer and they were right. 'Andrew and I just broke down, it was devastating.' But after months of treatment, Mrs Maye, husband Andrew, and their two boys, Bradley, two and Jenson, now nine-months, are hoping for a cancer-free Christmas. Mrs Maye said: 'My next follow up with my consultant is October 6, the same day as my husbands 40th. 'I'll find out if my cancer has gone at the end of the year. We need some positive news after what has been the worst year imaginable. 'I hope other women, pregnant or not, read my story and look-out for the symptoms of cervical cancer. 'I'm lucky I was diagnosed before it was too late but I want others to realise that you don't just have to be up to date with your smears to avoid getting the disease.' Mrs Maye and her family have been supported throughout their journey by a charity called Mummy's Star - set up by Pete Wallroth after losing his wife Mair to cancer, one month after giving birth. Mrs Maye says her pregnancy was 'awful' and she knew something was wrong, but healthcare professionals reassured her the symptoms were related to her pregnancy . Mr and Mrs Maye have two boys, Jenson now nine-months-old and Bradley (pictured). The cervical cancer has destroyed any hope of the couple having more children . Mr Wallroth, founder and CEO of Mummy's Star said: 'Receiving a cancer diagnosis either during pregnancy or shortly after a birth is a situation that affects women across the UK every year but yet which there is very little awareness of or recognition. 'The trauma and challenges this places on a family are devastating, during a time when they should be excited about the prospect of a new birth or celebrating a new arrival. 'After Shelley got in touch with Mummy's Star and explained her situation in June this year we were able to help her in terms of emotional support by being able to speak to other women regularly who shared many of the experiences she was having and yet faced through our confidential forum.' He added: 'In additional I am glad to say that we were able to help her with some of the additional nursery fees that her family were incurring due to her treatment. This gave her peace of mind knowing that her children were safe in the surroundings of a place they knew and trusted' MailOnline has contacted the GP practice and local health authority involved but has yet to receive a response.

"Police in Morocco are investigating the illegal trade of dog meat after 37 carcasses were found in a butcher's vehicle . Authorities in Morocco have launched an investigation into the illegal trade of dog meat after 37 carcasses were discovered in the back of a butcher's van. A man was arrested in the centre of Casablanca after his Honda vehicle was pulled over for a routine traffic offence, it was reported. Officers decided to search the car and found the dog carcasses in the back. The driver told police he planned to . sell them to restaurants in the poorer areas of the city where they . would most likely be used in sausages. Police have now launched an investigation into the discovery of the dog corpses which they say were 'slaughtered, skinned and prepared for processing into sausages'. Dog ownership and consumption has been a controversial topic in Morocco, a strictly Islamic country, in recent years. In January 2009, a restaurant owner in Casablanca was jailed for six years for selling dog meat . presented as beef to his customers. During the investigation, the man . confessed to preparing the dog meat with chemicals to mask the smell and . colour of it. His four accomplices were sentenced to between eight . months and four years in prison. Islamic traditionalists have also been known to poison large numbers of stray dogs because they view them as 'unclean animals'. Religious leaders have taken . advantage of a new Islamic government in Morocco – which came to power . in November 2011 - to try and eradicate as many dogs as they can. Dog ownership is controversial in Casablanca where Islamic fundamentalists view them as 'unclean' animals . And a new law is currently being considered by Morocco's Parliament banning dogs considered 'aggressive'. Owners of 'dangerous dogs' face up to five years in prison and a fine of £3,000. Interior Minister Mohand Laenser told . members of parliament that the new law mainly concerned the owners of Pitbull terriers because of the danger these animals represent 'to the . security and peace of mind of citizens.' But he also mentioned the use . of such breeds 'for criminal purposes'. Saad . Jamil, a 32-year-old motorcycle salesman from Casablanca who owns a Rottweiler, said: 'People in Morocco do not have the dog . culture, they get dogs most of the time to show off. 'A few years ago we had a lot of dog fighting going . on in the city, and breeders all over started breeding Pitbulls, those . poor beasts where beaten and terrorised to get the worst behaviour out . of them'. 'I‘m hopping this law will not pass in its actual state, . because it will simply be a catastrophe'.","Police in Casablanca find 37 dog carcasses in back of butcher's van .

"Dead: Wayne Mills, 44, was killed by the owner of a Nashville bar, who claims he acted in self-defense . The owner of a Nashville bar featured in a reality TV show is claiming self-defense after he shot dead a veteran country music singer after a fight over the musician smoking in a non-smoking area. Wayne Mills, 44, has long been a fixture of the Nashville country music scene - Blake Shelton, Jamey Johnson and American Idol Winner Taylor Hicks all opened for him before they became stars. The owner of the bar, Chris Ferrell, has not been arrested and Nashville police are currently investigating his claims that he was defending himself when he shot Mills in the head about 5am Saturday at Pit and Barrel. On Sunday night, SPIKE TV was set to feature the bar on its show Bar Rescue, which brings in a professional restaurant consultant to give struggling pubs a make-over. The network canceled the new episode and aired a re-run instead. Ferrell told police that Mills became aggressive after a night of drinking. Michael Scott, a friend of Mills, told WSMV-TV that Mills and friends had been drinking with his pals on Friday night after going to see a performance. Ferrell shot Mills in the head after the two got into a fight when Mills wouldn't stop smoking in a non-smoking area of the bar, according to police. Mills, a native of Arab, Alabama, toured with the Wayne Mills Band, which played college towns for more than 15 years. The Pit and Barrel bar, where Mills was killed, had recently been featured on an episode of the SPIKE TV reality show 'Bar Rescue' Mills, who toured college towns for years, was a fixture in the Nashville country music scene. He was married with a young son .

"A growing number of women are having babies decades after they first became mothers. A forum discussion on popular parenting website netmums.com has revealed how some are expanding their families after feeling bereft by their first born flying the nest, while others are starting again after meeting a new man. Netmums user 'Sandi E' from Luton started the thread after discovering she was pregnant at the age of 42 and wrote to see if anyone else was in a similar situation. Age gaps: Pearl Lowe, left, and Uma Thurman have both had children in their forties more than a decade after they first became mothers . She wrote: 'I have just found out I'm pregnant and am 42 years old. Not my first baby but it's been 20 years since my last one! Just wondered if there are any other ""older"" mums to be out there.' She went onto explain that she is expecting again after starting a new relationship with a man who doesn't currently have any children. Despite being pregnant before, she said it felt like the first time again due to the years that had passed in between and raised a discussion on how maternity care has changed over the decades. The expectant mother was heartened by the responses to her post as numerous women joined the thread to share the news they were also expecting again in their forties. 'Debby D' from East Yorkshire wrote: 'I'm in a very similar situation I'm 40, . pregnant with my third. Got a son and daughter who are 24 and 22! This . will be my partners first too! Very exciting to start again.' Expanding family: Pearl had her oldest daughter, Daisy, left, when she was 19 with Gavin Rossdale and then had three more children in her current relationship with Danny Goffey . In the thread, the women discuss their fears over lack of energy as an older mother and worries that they will feel isolated given many friends their own age no longer have young families. But they have all found support and companionship in the online forum - something that wouldn't have been available to them when they first fell pregnant 20 years ago. 'Tina H' posted: 'Hi ladies, really glad I found this thread, I'm 38 & 14 weeks . pregnant with my fifth baby! My kids are 21,19, 16 and 11 and I have three . grandchildren too! I've found the care with this baby brilliant, they . seem to really look after us ""older' mums"".' The thread reflects figures released by the Office for National Statistics earlier this year that found pregnancy rates among over-40s in Britain are more than double those of 1990. More women over 40 are now becoming pregnant than girls under 18. Rise in older mothers: More women over 40 are now becoming pregnant than girls under 18 . The rise has been attributed in part to women having better career prospects - leaving them to delay motherhood till later in life - and the rising costs of buying a home and raising a family. They also said 'the instability of partnerships' was a cause - leading women to start a new family following the breakdown of a previous relationship. A number of celebrities fit the trend. Among them are Pearl Lowe, 44, who first became a mother at the age of 19 when she fell pregnant with daughter, Daisy, now 25. Pearl has gone on to have three more children with her husband, Supergrass drummer husband Danny Goffey, giving birth to their youngest when she was 41-years-old. She said Daisy - whose father Gavin Rossdale has started a new family of his own with Gwen Stefani - was delighted to become a big sister again to a sibling 22 years her junior. Actresses Uma Thurman and Jennifer Connelly are other stars who have had children in their forties with a new partner more than a decade after they first gave birth. Pulp Fiction star Uma was 42 when she had her third child with boyfriend Arpad Busson. She already had two children, Maya and Levon, with her ex-husband, Ethan Hawke, who were 16 and 12 when they welcomed their half sister. Meanwhile Oscar winner Jennifer had her teenage son, Kai, when she was 27 with photographer David Dugan, and then had children Stellan and Agnes in her late thirties and early forties with her current husband, Paul Bettany. Commenting on the parenting phenomenon, Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums, said: 'Having children in your 20s and again in your 40s can potentially mean you spend up to 40 years bringing up kids – and while that's a tough challenge for any mum, more and more are doing it. New start: Some women are becoming mothers again later in life due to new relationships . 'In some cases, women have a new partner later in life and want to give him a child while they still can. But for others, the trigger is when their older children leave the family home and they miss the closeness and comfort of family life, so opt to have another baby. 'Having a second family can be a big shock as older mums sometimes say they have less energy than when younger, but on the flipside, they are more experienced and having done it all before, are less likely to get stressed. 'But what is positive is that increasing numbers of women are financially secure and healthy enough to make this choice and build the family which is right for them.'","Pregnancy rates among over-40s are more than double those of 1990 .

"Jose Bosingwa was recalled by Portugal on Friday, four years after playing his last international. The 32-year-old, who fell out with previous coach Paulo Bento, was included in the squad named by Fernando Santos for next Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Armenia and the friendly against Argentina in Manchester on Nov. 18. The former Porto, Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers player, who is now at Trabzonspor, won the last of his 24 caps in a 4-0 friendly win over Spain in November 2010. Jose Bosingwa has not featured for his country since 2010 after falling out with former manager Paulo Bento . The former Porto defender now plies his trade in Turkey with Trabzonspor . Three years ago, he announced that he would not play for Portugal under Bento after the coach said that Bosingwa had been left out of the squad because he did not meet requirements, including 'emotional and mental ones'. Bosingwa said he had been 'offended and disrespected by these declarations'. Bento, already under pressure after Portugal's group stage exit at the World Cup, resigned in September following a 1-0 home defeat by Albania in a Euro 2016 qualifier. Santos has previously recalled defender Ricardo Carvalho, who also fell out with Bento. Bosingwa spent four years with Chelsea and won the Champions league in his final season . The 32-year-old moved to west London rivals QPR after his contract expired with Chelsea . Defenders Tiago Gomes of Braga and Loreint's Raphael Guerreiro were called up for the first time while striker Helder Postiga was recalled after being left out of Santos's first two games in charge last month. Santos will be able to sit on the bench for the first time since his appointment after the Court of Arbitration for Sport temporarily lifted an eight-match ban pending an appeal. The ban was imposed by FIFA after Santos, previously coach of Greece, was sent off during the World Cup second round tie against Costa Rica.","Bosingwa has been called up to the squad to face Armenia and Argentina .

"Police in Tennessee have renewed their search for college student Holly Bobo who has been missing for two years after a dog found what is believed to be her purse. Bobo, a 20-year-old nursing student at the University of Tennessee at Martin, was last since in April 2012 by her brother, who reported seeing her being dragged into the woods by a man dressed in camouflage. The first major break in the case was made Wednesday when a neighborhood dog brought the tattered and filthy pink bag to the back door of its owner's home near Darden, Decatur County - about a mile from Bobo's home. Major breakthrough: A dog found what was believed to be nursing student Holly Bobo's bag (pictured) more than two years after she went missing in rural Tennessee . Tragic beauty: The bright-eyed 20-year-old college student Holly Bobo was allegedly abducted by a man who led her into the woods in April 2011, never to be seen again . Witnesses say the purse resembles the one Bobo had with her the day she went missing on April 13, 2011. Officials with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation came out in full force Thursday in an effort to locate the place where the dog may have discovered the purse hoping to find additional clues, the station WSMV reported. Authorities are now scouring a rugged area near Bobo's home, which was the focus of a massive 2011 search involving hundreds of volunteers who combed 68 square miles and 57 miles of roads. The new hunt for Bobo comes less than a week after her hometown marked a somber two-year anniversary since her disappearance with a walk and a run in her honor. Bobo went missing from her home in Darden, Tennessee on the morning of April 13, 2011. Her brother Clint, 25, told police he had seen her being led into the woods by an unknown man wearing hunting camouflage at around 7.30am. Snatched: It turns out the bag did not belong to Holly, according to her mother and investigators . Keeping the faith: Friends and strangers have been tirelessly spreading the word about Miss Bobo with fliers and pictures adorned with pink ribbons . Sombre benchmark: The break in the case comes less than a week after a two-year anniversary of Bobo's disappearance . Family pulling together: Bobo's parents have been traveling around the state talking about their daughter's case . He called authorities when he saw a small amount of blood in the family's carport where Bobo was believed to be abducted on her way to school. Clint Bobo said he initially thought she was being taken into the woods by her boyfriend, but became alarmed when he saw the man's arm holding onto his sister and called 911. John Mehr, spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said in 2011 that officials believe Bobo followed her abductor into the woods without showing resistance because she was 'in fear of her life.' The reward fund for information leading to Holly's safe return home has swelled to $250,000. Investigators have claimed they have had 'significant' findings over the past two years, yet none have led to the discovery of Holly. Her parents have previously said they thought it could have been someone who knew the family and their morning routine. Home turf: The tattered pink bag turned up near Darden, Tennessee, about a mile from Bobo's home . New search: Authorities returned to the rugged area in Decatur County hoping to find the spot where the dog discovered the purse . Fresh start: Officials returned to the rugged area around Bobo's home, which previously had been scoured by hundreds of volunteers . After her disappearance, more than a thousand volunteers searched nearby wooded area, and especially Natchez Trace State Park, for clues, Fox News. Authorities armed with high-resolution imaging equipment scoured lakes and ponds, but to no avail. Bobo's mother, Karen, quit her job as a teacher to devote her time to spreading the word about her daughter's abduction. Holly is 5 feet 3 inches with shoulder-length blonde hair and weighs around 110lbs. She was wearing a pink shirt and blue jeans at the time of her abduction.","Tattered pink bag was brought by dog to owner's home in Darden, Tennessee, about a mile from Holly Bobo's home .

"Gareth Bale will be moved into a new central midfield role as Carlo Ancelotti attempts to find a winning formula his new team of galacticos. Bale has been playing as part of a front three alongside Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo since his world record transfer from Tottenham last summer. But the introduction of Colombian star James Rodriguez this season could see the Welshman moved deeper to play alongside Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, according to Spanish paper Marca. Real problems: Gareth Bale will drop deeper to add balance while Cristiano Ronaldo has had to backtrack . Real Madrid have started this season slowly, a Spanish super-cup defeat to city rivals Atletico followed by an unconvincing victory over newly promoted Cordoba and a shock loss against Real Sociedad. There has been criticism over the sale of Angel Di Maria to Manchester United and despite assembling the most expensive squad in the history of football, Real have struggled to find the form that saw them crowned European Champions last season. However, Ancelotti hopes that moving Bale into the role occupied by Di Maria last season he will strengthen the midfield and find a balance.

Mundo Deportivo hail 'King Neymar' while Italy is focused on the Juve row as international football dominates . The World Player of the Year had been quoted criticising the club, but now says his words were misunderstood and he is fully supportive of Perez in a move AS describe as 'breaking and going into reverse'. 'My comments have been misinterpreted. Yesterday I heard what my President had to say and I am with him 100 per cent'.

"Sachin Tendulkar is left in no doubt that the Indian Super League can become as big as any other tournament in the footballing world. The 41-year-old, speaking at Lord’s during the launch of his new autobiography ‘Playing It My Way’, was forthright in his view that the ISL is capable of making an impact on the sport’s landscape in years to come. Tendulkar has a vested interest in its continued emergence after winning a bid to co-own Kochi’s Kerala Blasters - the side to have landed former England goalkeeper David James as both their coach and marquee player. Tendulkar was speaking at the launch of his new autobiography 'Playing It My Way' They also boast former Football League stalwarts Iain Hume, Michael Chopra, Stephen Pearson and Jamie McAllister. Involvement in the business is something the Little Master will continue to press ahead with after retiring from cricket this time last year. The franchise division has already attracted a host of other stars from across the globe - in a similar vein to cricket’s IPL. Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg, Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet have all signed up for the inaugural campaign. Nicolas Anelka scores for Mumbai City FC, and Tendulkar believes the league can be huge in future . ‘Internationally, football is really really big. In India we have all the potential to make football as big as anywhere else in the world,’ he said. ‘Football is definitely not as big as cricket in India, but I see it getting really big in times to come. The response to the ISL has been incredible.’ Any new franchise is met with an air of scepticism - there are suggestions that older players want one last payday before calling time on their careers - but Tendulkar is adamant that the sporting hunger of those in his homeland will see to it that football in India will thrive. The likes of David Trezeguet (left) and Robert Pires are playing in the Indian Super League . And it’s clear that a ringing endorsement from an individual so many in India worship because of his skills with the bat carries quite some weight. Tendulkar - who notched more Test runs and centuries than anyone else - was at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Thursday to watch Kerala beat FC Goa. ‘I was in Kerala yesterday [Thursday] evening. I was asked a couple of questions and I couldn’t hear the compere because the crowd was so loud. Hundreds turned up at Waterstones in Canary Wharf on Friday to greet the Indian cricketing legend . ‘The response has been really strong. People want to support football and its players in India - and make it a big sport.’ Despite boasting a population over more than one billion, they have never qualified for a World Cup and won’t be in Australia for January’s Asian Cup and lag behind other countries - notably Oman, Iraq and Palestine. Tendulkar sees the bigger picture, however, and hopes the start of the ISL will bring on a generation of younger players to begin challenging for tournament qualification. ‘Its not going to happen overnight. It requires work from all directions,’ he added. ‘That’s what we are trying to do: support the players and give them a platform to realise their dreams.

"The author behind one of the most unforgettable villains of cinematic history has finally revealed the real-life killer behind his chilling creation. Thomas Harris, who rarely gives interviews, has previously never spoken about what inspired his cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter, as portrayed in the classic Silence of the Lambs by Anthony Hopkins. But he has now revealed the character was inspired by a real-life doctor and murderer he met while visiting a Mexican prison in the 1960s . Author Thomas Harris (right) has revealed the inspiration for his most chilling creation, Hannibal Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs (left), was in fact a real-life doctor he met in a Mexican prison while working as a journalist . Harris met the doctor at the  Nuevo Leon State Prison, at Monterrey, Mexico, as a 23-year-old journalist. The author was at the prison to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a former mental patient who was under the death sentence for killing three people. But he met 'Dr Salazar' after learning he had apparently saved the life of Simmons when he had been shot during an attempt to escape from the prison about a year earlier. Writing in the introduction to The Silence of the Lambs 25th anniversary edition, part of which has been published in The Times, Harris explains how he was introduced to the killer doctor by a prison warden, who failed to tell him of his violent past. The author recalls interviewing Dr Salazar, which he later explains is not his real name, about how he treated the gunshot wounds and stopped the bleeding. Dr Hannibal Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins in the 2001 film Red Dragon, is one of the most unforgettable villains in cinematic and literary history . But he describes how the conversation . took a much darker twist when the doctor began questioning the . journalist on Simmons's disfigured appearance, the nature of torment and . the murderer's victims. It was . not until Harris left the doctor's office that he learned of Dr . Salazar's history from the prison warden. The doctor was a murderer and the warden told Harris: 'He will never leave this place. He is insane.' Harris says the doctor served 20 years in prison, but also provided the inspiration behind his most famous creation. He explained while writing his novel he needed to create a character with a 'peculiar understanding of the criminal mind', adding: 'It was not Dr Salazar. But because of Dr Salazar, I could recognise his colleague and fellow practitioner, Hannibal Lecter.' Lecter was first introduced by Harris in the 1981 novel Red Dragon, where he was depicted as a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibal. He became part of cinematic history however when Hopkins portrayed the character in the Silence of the Lambs, winning an Academy Award for the part along the way. It was in this film that he delivered the immortal line: 'I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti'. In the film Lecter questions a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling about her childhood traumas, in a scene which is eerily reminiscent of Harris's depiction of his encounter with Dr Salazar. Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, Harris's detective whose terrifying encoutner with Hannibal Lecter in the film Silence of the Lambs was inspired by a real-life doctor . The first film adapted from Harris's novels was Manhunter, which was based on Red Dragon and featured Brian Cox as Lecter. Hopkins reprised the role however in 2001's Hannibal, where Lecter became the main character of the film. He also played Lecter in a second adaptation of Red Dragon in 2002. The character was chosen as the number one movie villain by the American Film Institute in 2003.","Thomas Harris reveals real-life doctor was inspiration for Hannibal Lecter .

The former Greece boss has decided to appeal against the eight-game ban he received from FIFA . Paulo Bento decided to step down from his position as the manager of the Portugal national team . FIFA banned Santos in August for verbally abusing match officials in Brazil while coaching Greece. Santos is appealing that ban, with a ruling expected this week. Santos, who was due to leave the Greece job after the tournament, was banished from the dugout after extra time of a second-round match against Costa Rica, which finished 1-1. His team then lost the penalty shootout. Santos needs to rally a Portugal team that disappointed at the World Cup, where it went home after the first round, and then lost 1-0 to Albania this month in its opening European Championship qualifier. Portugal's next match in its campaign is against Denmark on Oct. 14. Portugal, who were led by Cristiano Ronaldo, crashed out of the 2014 World Cup during the group stages . Santos has built a reputation for rescuing troubled teams. He took over a Greece that was in the doldrums after the 2012 World Cup, and racked up an unbeaten run in his first 15 months on the job. He picked talented youngsters and introduced a more attacking style, often deploying three strikers. That is the kind of makeover Portugal needs, with fans demanding more playing time for a younger crop of players, more goals, and less dependence on star Cristiano Ronaldo, who sat out the Albania match. Before joining Greece in 2010, Santos coached Portuguese clubs Porto and Benfica, and AEK Athens, Panathinakos, and PAOK in Greece.","The former Greece manager replaces Paulo Bento who quit after a poor run of results .

"Portugal's new coach Fernando Santos has lost his appeal against an eight-match FIFA ban for misconduct at the World Cup. The former Greece coach was given his punishment for verbally abusing match officials during his team's World Cup clash with Costa Rica. FIFA says its appeal committee rejected Santos' challenge. Fernando Santos received an eight-match ban for verbally abusing officials during the World Cup . The former Greece manager is sent to the stands where he watches his side exit the tournament on penalties . Santos can appeal again to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He was hired by the Portuguese Football Federation on Tuesday despite being banned from the touchline for eight competitive matches. Santos will serve the sanction during European Championship qualifying, though he can pick the team and attend training sessions. It could rule him out of the entirety of Portugal's qualification campaign. Portugal appointed Fernando Santos to replace Paulo Bento after a difficult World Cup and poor start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign . The manager took Greece to the World Cup knock out stages for the first time in their history . Albania shocked Portgual in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier, winning 1-0 in Aveiro . It was a defeat that cost former coach Paulo Bento his job after presiding over an awful World Cup . The 59-year-old coach was sent to the stands during the second round game in Brazil. Santos was banished from the dugout after extra time, which finished 1-1. Greece then lost the subsequent penalty shootout.","Portugal's new coach Fernando Santos fails in his bid to overturn an eight-match FIFA ban .

"It was Frank Leboeuf’s mother who first noticed something in her son’s face that leads to his many deaths these days. ‘Sometimes she would see me playing football or giving an interview and she would call me,’ Leboeuf says. ‘She would ask, “Why are you so sad, Frank. Why are you upset?” ‘I would say, “I am not sad, this is just my face. And you know my face!” But I guess she sees what the directors see. Maybe it is a sad face, even if I am happy. It means I play a certain type of character and they die a lot.’ Former France and Chelsea star Frank Leboeuf has followed a career in acting . Leboeuf celebrates scoring for Chelsea against Crystal Palace in 1997 . This is what Leboeuf terms his ‘second life’, more specifically the acting career that has followed the World Cup and European Championship he won, among other things, as a footballer player which sees the Frenchman follow in the footsteps of Manchester United legend Eric Cantona. It is the life he always wanted, a dream that preceded the one he had to play football. If he gets his wish, it could in time see him regarded as a fine actor who used to play a bit of football. Some of his countrymen in France might stop sniggering. But it’s a long journey for a legend of Chelsea; it’s many more deaths away. ‘Maybe it is my face,’ Leboeuf says. ‘A lot of my characters have a deep, maybe dark side. ‘I have died many times. In my first play I was killed and I have done eight movies and been killed four times. One was a suicide. I think I die well. ‘But I like these guys. I love to play something I am not. I try to be a nice guy in real life. In the movies I can kill people and be a bad guy and shout. I love that.’ The Frenchman would often step up to take Chelsea's penalty kicks during his time at the club . With Chelsea . FA Cup: 1997, 2000 . League Cup: 1998 . FA Community Shield: 2000 . UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1998 . UEFA Super Cup: 1998 . With France . FIFA World Cup: 1998 . UEFA European Championship: 2000 . FIFA Confederations Cup: 2001 . His latest film, Allies, is released on DVD on Monday, while two more are in post-production. Allies pitches the former Chelsea defender as the leader of a French Resistance group in World War II, his role a brief blitz of extreme violence, shouting and shooting. ‘I think my character, Marcel Deville, is a good guy but he likes justice and doesn’t like traitors,’ Leboeuf says. ‘He doesn't treat traitors very well, but he is still a hero. That role was very intense, but good fun.’ Leboeuf, as a child in Marseille, wanted to act more than he wanted the career that would yield two FA Cups, the League Cup, the European Cup Winners Cup and the two major honours of international football. ‘It was my first passion,’ he says. ‘I wanted to become an actor before becoming a football player. Because of my mother I was watching movies and we used to watch plays as well. I told her I wanted to be an actor. ‘But my father created a football academy, so I used to play with my father and friends and it went well. I never had any regrets. But when I gave up my career in 2005 I went to Los Angeles because I was so desperate to learn.’ Lebouef celebrates winning the 1997 FA Cup final against Middlesbrough with his Chelsea team-mates . Leboeuf, who as a Chelsea player in 2001 appeared in his first film, Taking Sides, featuring Harvey Keitel, spent two years in Los Angeles. ‘I was learning everything I could,’ he says. ‘I am putting in the hard work. I am taking this very seriously. ‘I am only aiming for happiness. When I decided to give up my career, in the space of four months we had a family bereavement and I got divorced. I am another person now. I am happier now, more conservative in my private life. The former defender celebrates winning the World Cup with France in 1998 . Leboeuf has followed fellow Frenchman Eric Cantona (above) into the acting world . ‘Acting is a big part of that. In sport, the goal was titles. In the movie industry, you want to share something artistic, something creative.’ Needless to say, there has been scepticism. ‘I have to admit, it is odd in France,’ he says. ‘When you were a footballer you stay a footballer. But I didn’t decide after one night, “I want to be an actor”. I have earned the right to show what I can do. ‘My job in each role is to make people forget about me as a footballer, to only see my character. Having that life in football is not a plus in my life right now because people never forget what you did. Maybe the new generation will.’ Not that Leboeuf has, or indeed wants, to forget his past life. He calls himself a Chelsea fan. ‘I think they are title favourites,’ he says. ‘It is between them and Manchester City but I think they can do the treble – Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. Diego Costa has made a big difference. ‘For me it is the best squad they’ve had and Mr Mourinho knows exactly how to motivate a team. I think they will win a lot this season.’ His more pressing hope is that the scripts continue arriving at the current rate. And that some of his characters see the final page. Leboeuf believes Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side will win silverware this season .

"Three rocky outcrops, the size of kitchen tables, could be worth billions of dollars to the West Australian government. The three rocks, which are barely one metre above sea level and three metres long, were discovered by Geoscience Australia during a satellite sweep of the area. Since they are naturally forming and sit 'above ordinary high water', they have been classified as 'islands', prompting a redrawing of West Australia's maritime boundaries. Three rocky outcrops, barely a metre high, have been found off the coast of Western Australia. Since the outcrops are technically islands, they prompt a redrawing of West Australia's maritime boundaries . The tiny outcrops sit directly above the Torosa gas field, which makes up more than half of the multibillion dollar Borse offshore petroleum project and mean the state government's share of Torosa may increase from 5 percent to up to 65.5 percent. The outcrops are part of the North Scott Reef, 300km north-west of Cape Leveque on the north coast of Western Australia. Geoscience Australia shared news of the discovery with other agencies last week after they realised the huge ramifications of the discovery, reported the West Australian. A spokesman for West Australian Mining Minister Bill Marmion said the state government were notified of the find on Wednesday. 'It will means billions of dollars for the state,' he said. The redrawing of the boundaries has not yet been ratified, but West Australian Mining Minister Bill Marmion said the discovery was 'very exciting and potentially a great windfall for the state.' A satellite image of the Scott Reef where the rocky outcrops were found. The reef sits above the Torosa gas field, which makes up half of the Browse LNG project, one of the largest gas and oil projects in Australia . Bill Marmion, WA's mining minister, said the find meant a 'huge windfall' for the state . 'We're now working closely with the Federal Government to determine Western Australia's share of the Browse field and it's exact implications. 'WA will work cooperatively with the Commonwealth and the Joint Venture partners to the bring the project into production,' said Mr Marmion. The proposed boundary changes could affect up to seven of the 13 gas fields in the area. The Browse LNG project is one of the country's largest oil and gas developments. Mr Marmion told the ABC that this discovery will probably not have any effect on whether the gas will be processed onshore at James Price Point. WA Premier Colin Barnett has advocated for gas to be processed onshore at James Price Point north of Broome, sparking widespread protests on the grounds that the site is culturally and environmentally significant. Woodside refused that option, saying it was not financially viable and it prefers floating liquefied gas technology. Mr Marmion told the ABC: 'The premier has actually said that for this particular project floating LNG is probably already organised.' James Price Point was the proposed location of the on-shore gas processing plant, though the gas will now be processed off-shore on floating platforms . The Browse LNG project is one of the country's largest oil and gas developments, all the gas will be processed on a floating LNG platform like this prototype .","Three tiny rocks off the coast of West Australia have been deemed 'islands'

"With 11 children and 11 grandchildren, life for Katerina Sisarova, 43, from Slovakia, used to be a struggle to make ends meet. But seven years after moving to Rotherham in Yorkshire, Mrs Sisarova says life is 'very nice' - and it's all down to the £430 a week she receives from the taxpayer. What's more, Mrs Sisarova, who has worked for a grand total of one month in seven years, says she has no plans to find work and spends her time caring for her grandchildren instead. Shameless: Katerina Sisarova, 43, came to the UK seven years ago but has had a job for just one month . And she isn't the only one. Although husband Peter, a builder by trade, has had the odd job, he hasn't worked for two years while all but one of Mrs Sisarova's 11 children are unemployed and living on benefits. 'We have a good life here,' says an unrepentant Mrs Sisarova, whose £24,000 annual income is six times what she would have received in Slovakia. 'We have . everything that we want here. We didn't have flats like this [council house] in . Slovakia. We didn't have electricity or radiators. We didn't have . anything - anything!' 'My country no have job, no food... nothing,' adds her husband. 'No. I'm not going back - no, not ever. I like it here in England. Big family: In the UK with Mrs Sisarova is her husband Peter and their 11 children and 11 grandchildren . Handouts: Daughter Petra, 20, lives in a nearby council house with her son Peter and is handed £650 a month . 'England give me house, give me doctor, school, benefit. England good. Thank you so much England. Thank you very much.' Daughter Petra, 20, lives in a council house nearby with her son Peter, three, and also lives on handouts, which in her case, total £650 a month. 'I get child benefit, tax credit, housing . benefit,' she says happily. 'I've got a better life here than in my country. I'm never . going to go back to Slovakia, never.' 'England is good,' adds her father. 'My country no good. No . jobs, no anything. Too many people from Slovakia coming England because . my country no have job. 'I go from my country. I have no house, I have . nothing. Here I have house. I am very, very happy.' Unfortunately for Mrs Sisarova, her reluctance to find work hasn't gone unnoticed by the job centre, which has threatened to cut her benefits - much to her fury. No work: Peter Sisarova, right, is a builder by trade but has been unemployed for more than two years . Tension: Rotherham is home to an estimated 6,000 Roma gypsies - the cause of much tension in recent months . 'It's not fair to suspend money like . this,' she fumes. 'Is it right to do that? No! Every time I go to sign on, they come . up with something... all the time. I am so cross! So cross!' Luckily, help is at hand in the form of the Unity Centre, a community development charity with branches all over the UK. In Rotherham, much of the development work involves helping newcomers to settle in, which as translator Mikel explains, often means helping them claim benefits. 'Katerina comes here quite often,' he explains. 'We try to help her with making phonecalls or filling in forms.' He adds: 'She has been suspended a few times from the JSA [jobseekers allowance] payments and the reason is that she is not actively looking for a job. 'The problem with them is that they have . been here a long time but they are not mixing with non Roma people. You . have to go out there and try to learn English.' Hard times: According to translator Mikel, many are trying to get a job but others want to live on benefits . Difficult: Local paper, the Rotherham Advertiser, has called for curbs on migrants as a result of tension . Not that Mrs Sisarova needs to. Rotherham has one of the largest Roma populations in the UK, with an estimated 6,000 already living in the city - the cause of tension earlier this year between locals and incomers. So why the UK and why Rotherham? According to Mikel, benefits are a huge draw. 'Because the UK is in the EU, we [Roma] can work or claim . benefits. 'The UK is a welcoming country, an easy country to be in. I . think it's easier to claim benefits here than in our countries, so if we . have people in here, we help them to claim benefits. ' But, he adds, not every Roma migrant has travelled to the UK purely to benefit from taxpayer-funded handouts. 'Not every Roma is the same,' he explains. 'There are plenty of Roma people here trying to live better lives . free of discrimination and racism and who are hard working. 'Then there . are other Roma who may be abusing the system. And don't get me wrong, . there are some of the British people who could say ""they don't do . nothing"" and stuff like that. 'A few of those people have got a point . actually... We've got people here who are just on the take and the make.' Among them is Mrs Sisarova, who, thanks to Mikel's efforts on her behalf, has managed to evade having her benefits cut once more. 'She will get paid job seekers allowance of £500 a month,' beams daughter Petra. 'Very nice!' adds her delighted mother.

'I didn't tell people what was going on in my head until one day Belle was crying and I just cracked up and broke down. I just couldn't do it anymore. 'I didn't want to give her a bottle because I felt I didn't love her and I didn't want her.' Counselling helped Suzi recover and bond with her daughter and she now plans to return to education to study psychology counselling to help other sufferers and mentor young adults. She said: 'I started counselling in January, as I had to wait a while for an appointment, and I was discharged after a course of 4 sessions instead of 8. 'I decided, with help from PANDAS that PND didn't ""have"" me and that I would take control. I'd suffered with depression for years beforehand but never to this stage. I needed serious help at this point. 'I've been given this beautiful life to take care of and provide for and I couldn't do it with PND taking over. Counselling helped Suzi recover and bond with Annabelle and she now plans to return to education to study psychology counselling to help other sufferers and mentor young adults . 'I've had . so much help from my parents, who are both disabled, and we would be . lost without them. Involving family can be very hard, more so if they . don't understand how you think or feel. 'I had to . take time out a few nights a week to relax, so, luckily I had help from . my parents. I used a mix of Emotional Freedom Technique and counselling . skills to overcome this illness. I spoke to other parents from . CreateChurch:Cannock who have also given me a great deal of support. 'This . journey has not been easy and many mothers and fathers still suffer . today. It's vital we raise awareness for this, and PANDAS, in order to . offer support for such a silent illness.' There are . only three PANDAS support groups across the West Midlands - and none in . the Birmingham area - and Suzi is calling for women to come forward to . start groups in the region. She said: 'We want people to know that it is OK not to be OK. If there are people who have recovered from post-natal depression in the Birmingham area who would like to help others by starting a support group, PANDAS would love to hear from them.' The charity provides a free starter pack and other assistance to help volunteers set up support groups. Anyone who wants to start a group or needs help coping with post-natal depression can contact PANDAS on 0843 2898401 or see www.pandasfoundation.org.uk . Feeling 'low' after . having a baby, also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is . considered normal, but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much . deeper and long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND). Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic) It . usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on . gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite . severe. Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to . cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby. They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel . hopeless about the future. Many . of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say . that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and . to be less severe. Treatments . for PND include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, . which can be very effective. Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also . be offered for short-term use. Some . women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, . and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and . anxiety. Practical and . emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a . great help to those suffering from PND. Getting out to meet other . parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and . anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an . antidepressant. Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness . provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering . from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 .

"Sylvester Stallone's son Sage has been found dead in his Los Angeles apartment. The 36-year-old aspiring filmaker is understood to have overdosed on pills and coroner's officials are investigating if it was accidental or suicide, according to TMZ. His action hero father, 66, who was at the Comic Con film convention in San Diego yesterday, is 'devastated' and 'grief-stricken', his publicist said today. Tragedy: Sylvester Stallone's son Sage was found dead this afternoon in his Los Angeles apartment after a suspected drug overdose. He was 36, pictured here in 2006 in Hollywood . Pronounced dead at the scene: The coroner's van was spotted at Sage's home in Los Angeles along with news crews . Police said they found the younger Stallone in the home while responding to a 'welfare check', however Sages' lawyer George Braunstein said he was found by a housekeeper. Friends and acquaintances had become concerned because they hadn't heard from Sage in the past day. Paramedics were called and pronounced him dead at the scene. 'Sylvester Stallone is devastated and grief-stricken over the sudden loss of his son,' the actor's spokesperson Michelle Bega said in a statement. Red carpet smiles: Sage pictured in 1996 at the Hollywood premiere of Daylight with his father Sylvester and his now-wife Jennifer Flavin . Double act: Sage appeared alongside his father in the 1990 movie Rocky V, playing the role of Rocky's son Robert Balboa . 'His compassion and thoughts are with Sage's mother, Sasha.' 'He was a very talented and wonderful young man. His loss will be felt forever.' Braunstein said the death came as a shock, telling the New York Post this afternoon: 'He was in good spirits, and working . on all kinds of projects. 'He was planning on getting married. I am just devastated. He was an extremely wonderful, loving guy. This is a tragedy.' Before the heartbreak: Stallone was pictured yesterday with Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Comic Con film convention in San Diego . Sage Moonblood Stallone was the . oldest of Sylvester Stallone's children and co-starred with his father . in two films. He was the first of two sons Stallone had with first wife . Sasha Czack. He made his acting debut in 1990's . Rocky V - he played his Stallone's onscreen son - and also appeared with . his father in 1996's Daylight. Hand in hand: Sylvester pictured back in 1982 with his first wife Sasha Czack, Sage's mother . Also in 1996, Sage Stallone and . veteran film editor Bob Murawski co-founded Grindhouse Releasing, a . company dedicated to preserving and promoting the B-movies and . exploitation films of the 1970s and 80s. He also directed the 2006 short Vic, which screened at the Palm Springs Film Festival. Braunstein said Sage had frequent requests to work on films. 'He was a full of life filmmaker with . his whole future ahead of him,' he said. 'He was just very up and . enthusiastic and positive. 'I think it was probably some sort of accident,' he said of the death. Braunstein added that Sage Stallone greatly admired his father but was working hard to make his own name in the film industry. 'He was very proud of his father and proud to be his father's son,' he said. Stallone's split from Sage's mother Czack in 1985 after 11 years together. They also have a another son . Seargeoh, 32, who is autistic. He wed model and actress Brigitte . Nielsen in the following December in Beverly Hills but they split just two . years later in a very public divorce. He married third wife, Jennifer . Flavin, in 1997 after an eight-year on-again, off-again relationship and . they have three daughters: Sophia Rose, 15, Sistine Rose, 14, and . Scarlet Rose, 10. Sage, who was raised by his mother following his parents' divorce, felt distant from his father growing up, a theme which hit home as they were filming Rocky V together. Big boots to fill: Sage said he always worried about living up to his father's success, seen here together again in Rocky V . ‘When I was screaming, “You never spent time with me! You never spent time with my mother!” - that was true,’ he told People magazine in 1996. ‘I was looking into my father's face and really saying that.’ But it proved a turning point for the father and son, who went on to form a close bond and they acted again together in the 1996 film Daylight. ‘Between takes, Sly and Sage would roll around in the dirt like two puppies,’ the director Rob Cohen observed at the time. Sage certainly felt the pressure of growing up with such a famous father and would worry that he would never match his success. ‘I tell him, “As long as you give it your best, that's all that matters,” his mother Sasha said in that same year. Sage went on to pursue a career behind the camera and shunned the wild Hollywood party scene, preferring to watch horror zombie films instead. ‘People call me a hermit,’ he said while promoting the film. ‘But I'm happy.’","Action hero 'devastated and grief-stricken' over sudden loss of his eldest child .

"One spellbinding attraction of Lewis Hamilton is that he lives his career on the very edge. When it pays off, he is a hero. But on Saturday, straining for supremacy under the desert sky, he slipped off the track on his final qualifying lap and missed out on pole position. That accolade, ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix, went to his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who was three-tenths of a second faster. 'Lewis has gone off,' he was told over the radio. 'You are safe. Well done, pole position.' Eyes on the prize: Nico Rosberg will start Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix from pole position . Frontrunner: Rosberg denied British team-mate Hamilton a hat-trick of poles for the season so far . It was the first time this season . that Rosberg, the championship leader having won the opening race of the . season in Australia and finished second behind Hamilton in Malaysia . last week, had beaten his old friend in qualifying. He held a single . finger up behind Hamilton's head as they posed for pictures afterwards. The beaten man tried his best to raise a smile as the cameras clicked . but it looked an understandably forced gesture made for form's sake. He . is always most annoyed when he is responsible for an error. This was a . case in point, for the British driver had been dominant in practice and . surely realised that by locking up at the first corner of the last lap . he had denied himself a probable third consecutive pole position. 'You can't always get it right,' he sighed. Fastest three: Hamilton, Rosberg and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo were the quickest in qualifying . All class: Rosberg impressed on the Bahrain International Circuit despite trailing Hamilton through practice . Adrian Sutil will start at the back of the grid after a five-place penalty following qualifying. Sutil was found guilty of forcing Lotus' Romain Grosjean off the Bahrain International Circuit 'in an unsafe manner' towards the end of the opening 18-minute session. The Frenchman was forced to take evasive action to avoid being hit by the Sauber driver, although still managed to make it through to Q2, whilst Sutil could only qualify 18th. But after a stewards' hearing Sutil will now line up 22nd and last. His . mistake means Rosberg will start as favourite on the track where his . career began nine seasons ago by his setting the fastest lap for . Williams. The race would appear to be nicely set up. 'It has just worked well through the weekend,' said the German. 'I have found my way, made progress and resolved some issues. 'The . challenge this weekend is that free practice was in such hot conditions . and you have to guess what is needed in the cold conditions for . qualifying.' What he . did not mention was that he roared to pole despite having badly cut his . big toe when his left foot came into collision with a rock while running . in Dubai. His left foot, we note, only his braking foot. Brave face: Hamilton shows no disappointment after his team-mate snatched the front spot from him . Bright lights: Hamilton winds up his Mercedes in the marginally cooler night air in Bahrain . Daniel . Ricciardo again performed brilliantly in his Red Bull, pressing his . claims as the early revelation of the season by finishing third fastest, . albeit a second off Rosberg's mark. However, the 10-place grid penalty . Ricciardo carries over for being released unsafely in the pits in . Malaysia condemns him to start 13th. The poor boy, disqualified in Australia, is on an awful streak of bad luck. 'My . season has been going well but I don't have the points to show for it,' he said. 'I don't need to be conservative tomorrow, but to go for more . points.' It was a good . day for Williams, with Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez due to start . third and fourth after Ricciardo's penalty is taken into consideration. Jenson Button, of McLaren will line up in sixth place. Off track, more discussions to discuss the quieter engine noise are planned for Sunday.","Nico Rosberg on pole for Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix .

"As she showcased her toned physique on the cover of this month's Esquire, Cameron Diaz proved that 40 really is the new 20. And the 42-year-old Hollywood actress isn't the only over-40 giving women half her age a run for their money. Esquire has celebrated women at 42 in it's latest issue - and that includes the likes of Jennifer Garner, Sofia Vergara, Jada Pinkett Smith, Christina Applegate and Carmen Electra. Forty IS the new twenty: Cameron Diaz, looking younger and better than ever, covers the August issue of Esquire magazine and one of its writer even dedicated an entire article in praise of 42-year-olds like her . In praise of the older woman, writer Tom Junod says in Esquire: 'Let's face it: There used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty-two-year-old woman. 'With half her life still ahead of her, she was deemed to be at the end of something - namely, everything society valued in her, other than her success as a mother. 'If she remained sexual, she was either predatory or desperate; if she remained beautiful, what gave her beauty force was the fact of its fading. And if she remained alone... well, then God help her.' But with Cameron Diaz gracing its glossy cover in all her toned glory, the men's magazine believe that what's made these women figures of fantasy is their confidence. All hail 42: Writing in praise of the older woman, like 42-year-old Sofia Vergara, writer Tom Jundod argues that there used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty-two-year-old woman, now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free . 'A few generations ago, a woman turning forty-two was expected to voluntarily accept the shackles of biology and convention; now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free,' writes Junod. And this seems to be backed up by recent research, which revealed that today's over 40's generally feel happier, as well as wiser and more confident than they did in their 20's. The study found that 56 per cent of women over 40 believe they look younger than their actual age. The research, carried out by nice 'n' easy, also found that 64 per cent of . women over 40 say if they could give one piece of advice to their 20-year-old selves, they would tell them to have confidence in themselves. Happy and confident: Recent research revealed that today's over 40's, like Jennifer Garner, left, and Carmen Electra, right, both 42, generally feel happier, as well as wiser and more confident than they did in their 20's . Cameron even said in a recent interview: . ‘[This] is the best time of my life. I love being this age. I can’t wait . to be older. The most interesting parts are for women who are over 40. We don’t see it that way, because they’re not the sexy parts. ‘We’re not giving those women enough credit for what they’re accomplishing, which is beautiful performances.’ Junod does, however, points out: 'Of course, they have to work for their advantage; they have armored themselves with yoga and Pilates even as they joke about the spectacle.' And right he is, Cameron is a huge yoga advocate and is often spotted working out at the gym. She even penned The Body Book: The Law of Hunger, the Science of Strength, and Other Ways to Love Your Amazing Body. Staying in shape: Cameron is a huge health advocate and even penned The Body Book: The Law of Hunger, the Science of Strength, and Other Ways to Love Your Amazing Body . In it, Cameron passes down lessons gleaned through personal experience and as a result of her access to the top nutritionists in the world. She writes about healthy meal choices, which she discussed during a Wednesday appearance on Dr. Oz. Jennifer Garner is also a yoga devotee, while Sofia Vergara says working out is not her . idea of enjoyment. ‘For me it’s punishment,’ she said recently. However, the Modern Family star, who was . diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 28, says she knows exercise is . important for her health and tries to work out three times a week with . celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson, or she does spinning and Pilates. Peter Lloyd, journalist and author of forthcoming book Stand By Your Manhood, mused: ‘As the life expectancy goes up, the mean age for ""youth"" increases. 'Ever since The Golden Girls hit TV screens in the eighties - way before Sex and the City - women have redefined age on their own terms - glamour and sex are no longer the preserve of twentysomethings. 'Kylie Minogue, Kate Beckinsale and Kristin Davis are all fine examples of this. They illustrate how looking good doesn’t necessarily mean looking young. ‘Meanwhile, men like George Clooney and Jon Hamm are flying the flag for blokes. One of the best films to show sexuality across age lines is Shopgirl with Claire Danes and Steve Martin - it illustrates how, increasingly, age is nothing but a number. People are confident in showing their sexual and social duplicity throughout their entire lives. ’That said, there is still a double-standard. Older women with a sexual appetite are considered cougars, whereas guys are written off as dirty old men or creeps. Women complain about slut shaming and the like, but so many of them are guilty of it in reverse. Perhaps all this renewed confidence will help end that too.’","Esquire writer says 42 is the sexiest new age and women have never been so 'free'

"The 13-year-old grandson of Spain's King Juan Carlos is recovering after accidentally shooting himself in the foot with a shotgun. Felipe Juan Froilan was doing target practice outside the family home north of Madrid, when he misfired into his foot as he walked. It is thought the safety catch may have been off, which caused the  small 36 calibre shotgun to accidentally fire.

Widely known in Spanish media as simply Froilan, Felipe Juan Froilan is the son of King Juan Carlos's eldest daughter Infanta Elena. He was treated at Santa Barbara Hospital in Soria before being transferred . to the private Quiron clinic in the capital to have the wound surgically cleaned. This afternoon Felipe's grandmother,  Queen Sofia visited her eldest grandchild - his mother, Princess Infanta Elena spent the night at his bedside. Upon leaving the hospital the Spanish Queen said: 'Kids do give you shocks,' but added he was playing with his mobile phone when she left him.

Under Spanish law, it is illegal for children under 14 to possess or discharge firearms. A palace official declined to comment on the infraction. It is now up to a judge to decide whether to punish the boy's father. Spain's Civil Guard police said he could face a fine of up to  6,000 euros (£4,980).

"He was merciless in his mocking of fellow comedian Jimmy Carr over his shameless tax avoidance. Foul-mouthed Frankie Boyle, 39, could not resist lampooning Carr after it emerged he used an off-shore scheme to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax. In his newspaper column, Boyle joked: ‘Jimmy Carr has been attacked by Maxine Carr, who feels that he’s ruined the family’s good name.’ Comedian Frankie Boyle, left, joins Jimmy Carr, right, as the latest celebrity to be linked to a controversial tax scheme. He had previously mocked Carr for his involvement . And he also wrote: ‘If you’re rich, don’t look at it as tax avoidance, look at it as a children’s hospital buying you a pool table.’ But close examination of Boyle’s own tax arrangements reveal that he may also be the beneficiary of sharp – but entirely legal – accountancy practices on the millions he has earned through TV shows, tours, DVDs and book sales. According to one respected forensic accountant who examined Boyle’s publicly available company accounts, the Glasgow-based entertainer could have avoided paying nearly £900,000 tax through the voluntary liquidation of his firm last year. The company in question was Traskor Productions Limited, which was incorporated in England and Wales on December 17, 2009. The sole director and shareholder of the firm – whose business was described as ‘artistic and literary creation’ – was comedian Francis (Frankie) Martin Patrick Boyle. Close examination of Boyle's own tax arrangements reveal that he may also be the beneficiary of sharp - but entirely legal - accountancy practices on the millions he has earned . By September last year, Traskor had realisable assets valued at £3,083,884. This included a sum of £2,854,842, which Boyle had effectively lent to himself on the ‘director’s loan account’. The liabilities were shown to be £873,388, which were mainly the money due to HM Revenue and Customs and probably VAT. A forensic accountant who examined Boyle's publicly available company accounts, said he could have avoided paying nearly £900,000 tax through the voluntary liquidation of his firm . The following month, Boyle decided to wind up Traskor with the remaining cash in the company being extracted, in effect, by the comedian. The estimated surplus, after the £8,590 cost of liquidating the firm and settling of liabilities including corporation tax and VAT, was expected to be £2,201,906. If taken out as dividends or income, the marginal rate of tax which Boyle would suffer would have been at the 50 per cent top rate. By taking the winding up route, Boyle may have been able to pay a tax rate of just 10 per cent. This is because he could have been entitled to ‘entrepreneur’ tax relief, saving him up to £880,762. Yesterday Boyle was uncharacteristically reticent when the Daily Mail sought a comment from him at his £1.2million three-storey sandstone mansion in Glasgow’s West End. When he answered the door, the comedian was barefoot and wearing blue, striped pyjamas. He gave a dismissive wave of the hand and closed the door before a reporter could ask him why he opened and closed Traskor so quickly, and whether this allowed him to make huge tax savings. Last night Boyle’s agent Hannah Chambers, who also represents Jimmy Carr, said: ‘Traskor Productions Limited was a company of Frankie’s which has now been wound-up. He was director and shareholder of it as you have identified. The company’s arrangements, its tax treatment and Frankie’s dealings in relation to the company were normal and legal.’ However, the forensic accountant who examined Boyle’s company accounts said the structure of the arrangements seemed to be ‘aiming’ to benefit from entrepreneur’s relief, ‘which will save him a lot of tax, if his personal tax situation is such that he is entitled to it’. If he meets the qualifying conditions ‘there is nothing illegal about what he may be doing, but he could save a very large amount of tax potentially,’ the accountant added. The comedian responded today, admitting that he had made a tax saving after winding up the company. He tweeted: 'I wound my company up for legal reasons separate from tax and my accountant applied for tax relief on this.' In his Sun newspaper column last week, Boyle revelled in the Carr tax scandal. ‘The only person paying less income tax at the Jubilee concert than Jimmy Carr and Gary Barlow was Lenny Henry – because he doesn’t earn any money,’ he joked. And in a tweet he said: ‘It’s OK to avoid tax providing every time you do a joke about a town being s*** you add, “Partly down to me I’m afraid”.’ Boyle was a permanent panellist on the BBC’s Mock the Week for seven series and has made guest appearances on other panel shows including Have I Got News for You, Jimmy Carr’s 8 Out of 10 Cats, Would I Lie to You?, You Have Been Watching and Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Saving: The comedian confirmed on Twitter that he had benefited from tax relief . During his career, Boyle has gained a reputation for being offensive. He has caused controversy with his on-air comments about Katie Price and her disabled son Harvey. Four years ago viewers complained when he said on Mock the Week that swimmer Rebecca Adlington ‘looks like someone who’s looking at themselves in the back of a spoon’. The BBC ruled that the jokes were ‘humiliating’ and ‘risked offending the audience’, whilst also calling Boyle ‘a brilliant member of the team’. The father-of-two later caused outrage by making obscene ‘sexist and ageist’ remarks about the Queen.","Frankie Boyle's artistic company amassed assets of more than £3million .

"His lavish lifestyle ended with his arrest last year, but a suspected Massachusetts drug lord is finding it hard to adjust to the hardships of prison life. Alleged gang leader Alexis 'Papi-Thing' Hidalgo has written a letter complaining about the 'terrible food' and stingy soap supplies at Plymouth County Correctional Facility, where he is awaiting trial. The 32-year-old, who allegedly used drug money to fund a life full of flashy sports cars and luxury hotel stays, has requested a transfer to a prison that would suit his needs better. Rough ride: Alexis Hidalgo, the alleged leader of a Boston drugs gang, has complained about prison conditions . In a letter to district court magistrate Judge Robert B Collings, he complained that conditions were unsanitary and put his health at risk, Boston Herald reported. 'I understand this is prison, I buy . Commisary [sic] that I'm forced to use cold sink water to cook with, . which can bring health issues,' he wrote. Hidalgo, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, oxycodone and marijuana, also complained that the water tasted funny and was causing rashes in fellow inmates. It is a far cry from the life he is alleged to have led before a wire tap led to his arrest. He and co-accused Jonathan 'The Don' DaSilva  allegedly spent thousands of dollars during the 18-months they were under police watch. The pair reportedly rented high-end sports cars, stayed at luxury hotels and splashed out on a $10,000 table at a celebrity awards ceremony. As he awaits trial however, Hidalgo complained in his November 4 letter that even the soap was rationed to a travel size bar handed out every fortnight. Hidalgo drew a sad face next to his complaint that he was 'not allowed to buy soap' and claimed that the measly ration lasted only three days, forcing him to use 'unsanitary' washing up liquid. He also complained that the jail had no microwaves, a claim that was proudly confirmed by prison spokesman John Birkwell. 'There are no microwaves and no Keurig . machines or latte machines in the individual units, for obvious health . and security reasons,' Mr Birtwell told Boston Herald. Hidalgo also claimed he was unable to attend church, writing: 'ima a born-again Christian, threw [sic] god grace an blessing, im truely bothered with this one question? your Honor how am i being denied my god given as well as Constitutional right to practice religion.' The suspect, whose alleged drug empire was said to stretch from California, Maine and Miami, also complained that the jail failed to offer educational programs and drug-abuse counseling. The prison said these services were offered only to inmates serving a sentence as opposed to those waiting for their trial to begin. He signed off the letter by congratulating the judge on his forthcoming retirement and called him a 'true class act'. Judge Collings has sent the letter on to the U.S. Marshals Service and Hidalgo is still being detained at Plymouth.","Alleged head of Boston gang was living life of luxury before his arrest in January last year, police say .

The dog ate the hamster and despite being forced to cough it up, the animal had died. No charges were brought against Mr Khan in connection to the raid.

The hamster was owned by Musa Kham, who has been prosecuted by the RSPCA for failing to care for a parakeet whose feather had fallen out . Defence lawyer Tim Hughes said Khan had kept animals for many years safely. He said: 'He accepts keeping the bird in a cage that's close to a radiator and TV in a room where an old cat has been.' Mark Harper, prosecuting, said: 'The bird was in poor bodily condition and had lost feathers. 'It could have been avoided with a regular cleaning regime.'

"The mother of a 17-month-old girl who died after her neck became caught in the cord of a window blind has spoken of her heartbreak. Amanda O'Halloran has described the moment she attempted to resuscitate her daughter Sophia after discovering her lifeless body. She said her daughter hanged herself while playing at the family home in Tirley, near Gloucester, after she had been left alone for less than four minutes. Tragedy: Amanda O'Halloran has spoken of the moment she discovered her daughter Sophia (pictured) after she hanged herself by a window blind cord . Heartache: Miss O'Halloran said her daughter hanged herself while playing at the family home in Tirley, near Gloucester, after she had been left alone for less than four minutes . Miss O'Halloran said: 'Sophia was watching Peppa Pig on TV, which was her favourite. I went upstairs to go to the toilet and then went to grab some clothes for her to wear. 'When I came downstairs I couldn't see her at first and I immediately grew worried. Then I saw her there hanging on the blind cord. I was hysterical. 'I ran to her, grabbed her and started doing CPR. I was totally frantic. 'I had trained to do first aid but never thought I'd be doing it on my own daughter. 'I called the emergency number and the paramedics came by air ambulance. They took her to hospital. 'But there was nothing they could do. It was horrible. Only moments before she had been a happy, healthy child - so cheeky and full of life. And then she was dead, just like that.' Family: Miss O'Halloran and her partner Chris Parslow are still struggling to come to terms with Sophia's untimely death . Miss O'Halloran and her partner Chris Parslow have spoken about their ordeal as they start a campaign, called Sophia's Cause, to get looped blind cords banned across the UK. The campaign includes a Facebook page and an online petition which would force the issue to be debated in parliament if it is signed by 100,000 people. Sophia died on the morning of June 27. The blind cord had been in the house since the couple moved in 18 months earlier. Hidden behind the curtain, it had gone unnoticed. Miss O'Halloran said: 'Sophia was so inquisitive, looking to grab hold of things all the time. 'I have gone over it in my head over and over again - all the whats and ifs. What if we'd got rid of the cord? What if I had come downstairs sooner?' Campaign: Miss O'Halloran and Mr Parslow have launched a campaign called Sophia's Cause to have cord blinds banned in the UK . Miss O'Halloran and Mr Parslow are still struggling to come to terms with Sophia's untimely death. But they are determined no parents should go through the pain they are experiencing. Through Sophia's Cause the couple are campaigning to have cord blinds banned in the UK. Miss O'Halloran said: 'It's still very hard for us but I know that nothing will bring her back. 'If one good thing could come out of this, it would be that other parents realise the dangers of cord blinds and get rid of them from their homes. It would make us happy if other children are saved because of Sophia.' An inquest into Sophia's death will take place in Gloucester on November 14.","Amanda O'Halloran said she was 'hysterical' after discovering her daughter .

"Author Cheryl Strayed's best-selling travel memoir about her cathartic, 1,100-mile walk along the Pacific Crest Trail has become a literary phenomenon - but little did she imagine that the journey would bring her in touch with a sister she had never known. In 1995, when she was 26 and a first-time hiker, Strayed spent three months on the arduous trail as she sought a way to come to terms with her mother's sudden death from cancer, her own battle with drugs and a painful divorce. The experience gave Strayed the material to write the 2012 memoir Wild: A Journey From Lost to Found. The book became a New York Times bestseller and number one choice of the lucrative Oprah Winfrey Book Club. Family: Cheryl with her husband Brian, daughter Bobbi and son Carver. The author is building a relationship with her half-sister . Strayed, now a 44-year-old married mother-of-two in Portland, Oregon, has become a sounding board for many readers who have faced painful challenges in their own lives. She receives hundreds of emails from those who have found solace in her words - but, the writer told NPR, one message leapt out from all the others. One correspondent gave Strayed the startling news that she believed they had the same father. Coincidence: The author was emailed by her half-sister after she picked up her book in the library by chance and realized they had the same father . The woman was in fact the author's half-sister and had only discovered the fact by chance. She had been browsing the travel section at her local library when the cover of Wild - with its hiking boot on the cover -  had drawn her to pick it up and check it out. Later, just pages into the memoir at home, she realized her connection with the author. She recognized that Strayed was her half-sibling purely from the description of their father. Strayed told NPR that in the past she had tried to track her sister down by searching on her name a few times online. The author was aware that her half-sister knew her first name and that their father had another family with older children before she was born. Neither Strayed nor her half-sister have relationships with their father. Strayed told NPR that their bonding . experience has been an interesting journey for both women but that they . have yet to meet or speak on the phone. The best-selling author told NPR: 'I think that the trick to . writing a memoir and the trick to writing fiction is always to have this . consciousness of what it really means to be human, and what the human . experience is. 'And the human experience is full of serendipity and . surprise and situations taking a turn that you didn't expect.' The long walk home: Cheryl Strayed (pictured aged 26, left) embarked on a 1,100 mile trek along the Pacific Crest Trail after she lost her mother (right), battled drug problems and got divorced . Strayed's literary gold came when she found a way to deal with devastating situations in her own life. In 1995, she embarked on the thousand-mile trek from the Mojave Desert in Nevada, through California and Oregon to Washington State, a feat that would have cowed even the most experienced hiker. Her decision to carry out the dangerous trek followed several painful years. Strayed had lost her mother to cancer at the age of 22. Her marriage crumbled as she dissolved in grief and dabbled in drugs. For weeks on end, she walked the trail in the same clothes, leaving herself bloodied, bruised and hungry but completed the journey with a new found sense of self. Wild is expected to be turned into a movie after actress Reese Witherspoon bought the film rights to star as Strayed, while author Nick Hornby is adapting it for the big screen.

"A greeting card company hoping for a laugh used a doll meant . for Muslim girls as the basis for a birthday card that depicts a headscarf-wearing . little girl as a terrorist. In a pink hijab, or headscarf, and flowered dress, a doll is . depicted on the card saying things like ‘Pull string for message IF YOU DARE!’ and ‘She’ll love you to death!’ insinuating that the innocent-looking . Muslim is a suicide bomber. Joke? A greeting card company published this parody card (pictured) of a talking Muslim doll that suggests the girl in a headscarf is a terrorist . The card appears to be based on a real doll meant for . actual Muslim girls. The Aamina Muslim Doll, . which speaks phrases in Arabic, is the brainchild of a mother who . couldn’t find dolls that resembled her daughter. ‘It all started when my daughter was 2 ½ years old,’ writes . founder Farzana Rahman on her company website. ‘I was trying to find toys that . would help her to speak her mother tongue, Urdu. Failing to find anything, I . embarked upon designing a talking Urdu doll myself.’ The doll, which has a male counterpart in the Yousuf doll, was the . first of many products created by Rahman to celebrate Muslim and Arab culture . with toys. Aamina wears a pink hijab and a dress with flowers, just like . the girl on the card. That message has now been made into a joke by . greeting card company NobleWorks Inc., a joke a Chicago-area Muslim rights . group says plays upon hateful stereotypes. Real: The card bears a remarkable resemblance to Aamina, a talking doll meant for Muslim girls, from company Desi Dolls . Appropriate? A Muslim rights group believes the card is unacceptable and 'criminalizes' the culture of the children who play with Desi Dolls (pictured) The card was first released in 2011, but was only recently . noticed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in a Chicago . novelty store. ‘Islamophobic generalizations and negative stereotypes often . hit those who are most visibly perceived as Muslim,’ wrote Ahmed Rehab CAIR’s Chicago Monitor, ‘and women wearing the Hijab are often the group hit the . hardest. ‘Many Muslim women around the world, certainly in the US, . choose to wear the Hijab as a free-willed expression of modesty and . self-respect. For them, it is a message that men should address their minds and . not their bodies.’ NobleWorks, whose motto is ‘Dare to Laugh’ features an . extensive line of politically-themed humor cards on its website. Messages: Inside, the card reads 'Hope your birthday is a BLOW OUT!' and it appears to have been taken from maker NobleWorks' website . Kids toy: The Desi Doll company also makes a boy doll, called Yousuf . A brief survey . found a card on which President Obama uses the word ‘cracker’ as a derogatory . term for whites, a card showing a quizzical President Bush at a dam . construction site asking ‘Are the Levees Jewish?, and one featuring two Native . Americans and the slogan ‘Homeland security: Fighting terrorism since 1492,’ among many others. Also on the NobleWorks website is a personal message from company . owner Ron Kanfi. ‘I can only imagine folks and friends,’ writes Kanfi, ‘who . receive or read our cards, can help but wonder as to whether laughing is the . appropriate thing to do. But as our motto goes: ""F**k 'em if they can't . take a joke!""’ CAIR responded in kind: . ‘The notion that a doll, that looks like any other doll that . any little girl in the world would play with, can be presented as a terrorist . doll simply and only because it is a “Muslim” doll or because it has a “Muslim . scarf” on its head is not what defines “funny” for a lot of people, but . bigoted, ugly, idiotic, moronic, etc.’ The Muslim group said it has written an official letter to . NobleWorks sharing its concern over the card they say exposes little girls ‘to . messaging that criminalizes their basic identity for profit.’ The card appears to have been removed from the NobleWorks website.

"An Alabama pastor who is a suspect in his wife's murder was arrested at an airport on Wednesday night as he tried to leave the country. Police believe the Rev Richard Shahan was attempting to flee to Russia when they stopped him at a Tennessee airport as he tried to board a flight to Germany. The 53-year-old was subject to an arrest warrant after his wife, Karen Louise, was found stabbed to death in the couple's home. Stopped: Pastor Richard Shahan was arrested in an airport as police investigate the murder of his wife, Karen . Shahan had already checked in his luggage when he was stopped. His arrest warrant had included a 'customs lookout' in case he tried to leave the country, according to Daily News. He had been booked on to a flight to Frankfurt, but police claimed he had intended to then travel on to Russia. The pastor had been planning a three-year mission, based mainly in Kazakhstan, according to his church. Arrest: Shahan is due to be extradited to Alabama . Because the investigation into his wife's murder is still open, police had told him to remain in the country. When his wife's body was discovered in their Homewood home on July 23, Shahan was questioned and kept in police cells for 48 hours. He claimed he had been visiting one of the couple's two sons in Kentucky at the time of the murder, and was released without charge. Homewood Police Chief Jim Roberson said 'certain inconsistencies' in the pastor's interviews had led to officers to consider him as their main suspect. He claimed investigators had established a motive, but said: 'There are very few new details of which we can go into great elaboration because it is an ongoing investigation.' Attorney John Lentine, who is representing Shahan, told Al.com the statements that his client was attempting to flee the country were misleading. 'Some of the inferences that were put out there in the news conference made it sound like Richard was trying to leave the country and never come back,' Mr Lentine said. 'Anybody who's been keeping up with this knows that Richard had announced months ago that he was planning on going on another mission trip like he did in 2012.' He added: 'The chief is saying ""We've got our man"", then saying it's an ongoing investigation. There's your inconsistency. The reality is they've always looked at Richard, and they didn't bother to look any further out than that.' Mrs Shahan, who sang for years in the church choir, was found dead after failing to show up for work. Officers at the time said the couple's home had been in disarray. After his wife's death Shahan was . put on paid administrative leave from the First Baptist Church. He had . resigned from his post on December 31. Crime scene: Investigators carry bags of evidence from the couple's house in July . Investigation: Karen Louise Shahan, 52, was murdered at her Homewood, Alabama house, above . A statement from his First Baptist Church of Birmingham said: 'All of us were saddened by the unexpected news that Richard Shahan was arrested by Homeland Security just moments before his planned flight departure for Frankfurt, Germany.' 'There, he was to assume his new role working with the Children's ministry of Bible Mission International, primarily in Kazakhstan.' Members of the church had paid tribute earlier in the year to 52-year-old Mrs Shahan, who had two grandchildren. Bill Gladden, a church member and . former attorney who works with the church on legal issues, described her as 'a lovely person.' The Mayor of Homewood said the murder had shaken the usually peaceful area. 'The City of Homewood has been blessed . for situations like this to be the exception and not the norm,' Scott . McBrayer told AL.com. 'As with any other senseless act of violence, our thoughts and prayers go out to the family so deeply affected.' Shahan is due to be extradited to Alabama for a hearing on January 7.","Richard Shahan was due to join mission in Kazakstan, church says .

"A South Carolina man who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the murder of his mother and stepfather — who were found wrapped in plastic in his basement — has been apprehended a day after he escaped from a mental hospital, officials said Friday. Jason Mark Carter, 39, was picked up at a hotel in Fairview, Tennessee, after police tracked his cell phone pings - the technology that marks the location of your last signal. His aunt, Karin Thorne, said she was relieved. 'If he's not on his meds, he could injure someone,' she told NBC. Jason Mark Carter, who was committed to a mental institution following the 2006 murder of his mother and stepfather, escaped from the Craft Farrow State Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina, on Thursday morning. He was tracked down by police on Friday evening at a hotel in Tennessee . It's unclear how he escaped from the Craft Farrow State Hospital in Columbia, S.C., on Thursday morning but police believe he stole a 1991 Chevy van and later somehow purchased a Chevy Lumina. Carter was charged with murdering his stepfather and mother in Seneca in March 2006. The decomposing bodies Kevin and Deborah Ann Perkins were found by police wrapped in plastic in the basement of the family's home. They had been shot in the head with a .22 caliber handgun. Officers at the time said Carter ate and slept with in the same room as the bodies for three days. However, due to mental health issues, he was deemed not fit to stand trial. Instead he was involuntarily committed to an institution rather than being convicted. On Thursday morning, police in Oconee . County confirmed Carter escaped from a mental health facility in . Northeast Richland County. The South Carolina Department of Mental Health also confirmed the disappearance. He was reported to have been working in a supply business in the hospital's grounds when he made the escape. Police said an investigation has been launched to determine how the man got away. The car Carter stole was a white Chevrolet van from 1991, which was reported missing from the facility not long after his disappearance. In court, Carter's lawyer said he had no recollection of the crimes, according to WISTV. During the trial, mental health experts said that, with the correct medication, Carter's mental health issues could be controlled. Carter's grandfather, B.S. Pope, tried to convince the court that Carter was crazy like a fox and should stand trial for murder.","Jason Mark Carter, 29, committed to facility in Northeast Richland County .

"House prices rose to a record level last month, beating their pre-recession peak for the first time since the financial crash. The average home in England and Wales now costs £233,061 - £6,125 more than a year ago, the equivalent of a £510 increase every month. Prices have fallen in only one month out of the past 18. Through the roof: House prices has hit a record level and are now even higher than before the recession . The rise is being driven by a boom in prices in London, where demand is inflated by foreign buyers. Other areas have seen little growth. Observers think the steady rise could be an indication that government measures to boost home ownership have started to stimulate the market. The figures, recorded by the LSL/Acadametrics house price index, showed that national average prices are now above their previous peak of £231,709 during the height of the property bubble in February 2008. David Newnes, director of LSL Property Services, said: ‘Even taking inflation into account, the record high price is symbolic of the significant improvement in the housing market over the past year. ‘The catalyst for this has been significant improvement in mortgage availability. Capital gain: The rise has been driven by a boom on the London housing market where a weak pound has attracted a large number of foreign buyers to affluent areas such as Chelsea (pictured) He added: ‘Life for first-time buyers is noticeably easier than it was six months ago. ‘Great mortgage deals are on offer and lenders are more willing to lend to high-value borrowers. ‘Schemes like Help To Buy and Funding For . Lending have acted like a steroid injection for the mortgage market and . made it markedly stronger than last year.’ Going up: The price of an average home has increased £510 every month for the past year . Mortgage availability has increased sharply since the Government launched its £80billion Funding for Lending scheme last August, which gives lenders access to cheap finance. The Help to Buy scheme, announced in this year’s Budget, aims to increase the supply of low-deposit mortgages. Peter Bolton King, residential director of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said the scheme could increase prices, but he warned that might not be such a good thing. He told the Financial Times: ‘Our concern is that if the supply situation doesn’t improve we’ll be in a situation where Help To Buy could, in certain areas, help house price inflation. ‘There are massive areas of the country where people are very happy with all this help, but in London and the southeast [further price rises] really won’t help at all.’ Prices in the north are still about 10 per cent below their peak. Peter Williams, chairman of Acadametrics, said: ‘There is a distinct north-south divide, with regions in the southeastern part of the UK recovering at a much faster rate than those in the north.’ Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders released last week showed a positive picture for young people trying to get their foot on the property ladder. Over the first four months of the year, the number of loans to first-time buyers was 11 per cent higher than the same time a year ago.","Price of average home in England and Wales up £6,125 in a year .

"A TV news anchor is set to make a miraculous return to work on Monday evening after enduring a horrific past five weeks during which his heart stopped beating on two separate occasions. Leon Harris, a longtime anchor at WJLA-TV, an ABC News affiliate in Washington, D.C., has said he feels lucky to be alive after surviving a life-threatening health crisis which . put him in intensive care unit for two weeks and has left him with half a pancreas. His nightmare started on August 1, when he awoke suffering from an excruciating abdominal pain. Leon Harris, 52, is set to make a miraculous return to WJLA-TV on Monday evening after almost dying twice in August after being diagnosed with acute necrotizing pancreatitis . The pain became so bad that the 52-year-old could barely move and his wife Dawn found him curled into a fetal position at their Potomac, Maryland. house. Harris eventually had to be airlifted to hospital in Baltimore, where he was diagnosed him with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. His condition was life-threatening as his pancreas was inflamed and starting to die, which in turn had caused his kidneys to start to fail and his lungs were filling with fluid. The head of trauma at the Baltimore hospital described Harris' CT scan as ‘looking if a bomb had gone off… where the pancreas resides.’ Leon Harris, right, says he is lucky to be alive after suffering acute necrotizing pancreatitis last month, while wife Dawn, left, was told by doctors to prepare for the worst . Harris' pancreas was inflamed and starting to die, which in turn caused his kidneys to start to fail and his lungs to fill with fluid . To help him breathe Harris was placed on a ventilator and for the next nine days, he drifted in and out of consciousness. A doctor told his wife and their two children - a daughter and a son - to prepare for the worst. Speaking to Good Morning America about his ordeal, Harris admits he thought his time was up. ‘On two different days I died,’ he said. ‘I zeroed out and they revived me… I got sick and tired of trying to breathe.' Harris, who described being on the ventilator as 'trying to snorkel across a lake breathing through a cocktail straw,' admits he was ready to die. 'And I closed my eyes and I happened to see Dawn's face … And I said, ""I can't quit on her. If I quit on her, I'm going to go to hell, and if I go to hell, I'm not going to go to hell for quitting,'"" he recalled. Fore more videos, please go to GMA . Harris returned to work last Thursday for the first time since his sudden illness to see his colleagues and tonight he returns to anchor WJLA-TV's 5 o'clock and 11 o'clock newscasts . Then, just as suddenly as it came on, the pancreatitis subsided. It's still a mystery as to how Harris developed the condition, Since he doesn't drink much alcohol and works out regularly, doctors think it could have been related to a family history of gallbladder problems. Since getting out of hospital, Harris has been recovering at home and getting used to having just half a pancreas. He returned to work last Thursday for the first time since his sudden illness to see his colleagues and tonight he returns to anchor WJLA-TV’s 5 o'clock and 11 o’clock newscasts.

"A Uruguayan father who went missing in the Andes four months ago has been found alive after spending a brutal winter eating rats and raisins to survive.

"Keeping up with fashion can take its toll – as Claire Culverwell knows only too well. Hoping to emulate her style icons as a teenager, Miss Culverwell plucked her eyebrows to achieve a thin arch. Now aged 30, she has spent £3,500 on an eyebrow transplant operation, after the over-zealous tweezing permanently damaged her hair follicles, resulting in brows that wouldn’t grow back properly. Delighted: LEFT, Claire Culverwell is pleased with the effect of her eyebrow transplant after years of plucking left her with almost no eyebrows at all RIGHT: Claire overplucked for years. 'It was the fashion,' she says now . Miss Culverwell, a dental technician, said: 'I didn’t understand the harm I was doing to my eyebrows in my teens and I was horrified when I finally learnt the truth in my twenties. 'It badly affected my confidence. I didn’t like people seeing me without make-up. I would be reluctant to open the door if I hadn’t used my eyebrow pencil.' Just as men have their thinning hair boosted with follicles taken from the backs of their heads, women can have their eyebrows thickened using the same technique. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons has reported a surge in demand for the treatment, boosted, they say, by the current trend for bold eyebrows like those of the Duchess of Cambridge, currently the most high-profile member of the big brow brigade. Claire's eyebrows were transformed during a six-hour operation at the Crown Clinic in Manchester. In the pictures of Claire taken before the procedure, her eyebrows, which were no more than a thin line of hair, are barely noticeable. The practitioner drew an outline to indicate where he would extend Claire's brows . The 'after' pictures - taken months after the operation when the new brows had fully grown in - show the brows restored closer to how they looked before over-plucking occurred. Claire, 30, said she was thrilled with the results. She said: 'This is big problem for thousand and thousands of women - especially for those around my age. 'It was very fashionable when I was a teenager to pluck your eyebrows - everyone was at it. 'I wanted to look like the celebrities at that time and, to have that look, you had to pluck your eyebrows. 'I carried on doing it over may years at home with tweezers and ended up permanently damaging my brows. 'A hair follicle only has a finite number of cycles of growth and if you pluck it too many times, you end up killing it off. 'That is what happened with me. 'I realised I had brought this on myself and I was a little embarrassed to seek treatment. I thought the only people who had eyebrow transplants were people who suffered from alopecia.' Restored: The brows are now full and defined - but because the follicles are taken from Claire's head, she must trim them more regularly - cutting them every two weeks . Claire, from Manchester, eventually consulted the hair transplant surgeon Asim Shahmalak at the Crown Clinic just outside the city. He carried out a transplant by removing a narrow strip of hair from the back of Claire's head, taking care to chose hair that most closely matched the colour and texture of her eyebrows. The strip, which is around an inch long, contained 400 to 500 hairs, and each was painstakingly separated out under a microscope. Inspiration: BAAPS say that the Duchess of Cambridge's statement eyebrows have led to women who had over-plucked their brows seeking to restore them . The individual hairs, still attached to their roots, were transplanted by Dr Shahmalak into small holes made in Claire's eyebrows using a fine needle and under local anaesthetic. The one difference with her old brows is that new hair grows more quickly and needs to be trimmed every two weeks or so. Claire, who works at Timeless Therapy House clinic in Whalley, Lancashire, said: 'I am so pleased with the results. 'It has boosted my confidence and made me feel so much more comfortable about my appearance. It is the best thing I have ever done.' She said any women should seek expert help if they wanted to pluck their eyebrows. 'Don't do it yourself, is my advice,' Claire warned. 'You could end up doing permanent damage.' Dr Shahmalak said that the Duchess of Cambridge had sparked interest in the procedure. He said: 'Statement eyebrows are the new beauty must-have, but sadly many women have permanently damaged their eyebrows through over-plucking. 'For many women who crave fuller brows like the Duchess or stars such as Natalie Portman, the only solution is an eyebrow transplant. 'We have seen a big increase in interest in the procedure and many women, like Claire, have been delighted with the results.'","Trainee dentist Claire Culverwell restored overplucked brows to former glory with transplanted hair from her head .

Rebekah and her four children have had to deal with the shame of his . crimes, abuse from those he conned but can't help but admit the kids are . happy that their father is alive after all . While the authorities celebrated, his shocked wife had her whole life was turned upside down once again. Rebekah Price, 43, had grieved his loss since his disappearance on June 16, 2012. She had watched a court declare him legally dead months later - believing that he had committed suicide by leaping from a ferry into the Florida ocean. That ruling had meant she was divorced. She had also suffered his public shame and abuse at the hands of those he had defrauded. Mrs Price did not benefit from his life insurance, but instead had to scratch a living to provide for her children, aged from around ten to 20 years old. But she was surviving. She was doing it and the worst was behind her. Then she received a phone call from a friend who was watching the news of her husband on television. He had been arrested in Brunswick, Georgia, just 100 miles away from the family home in Valdosta, Georgia, where she lives. ‘Can you imagine going through that?’ her lawyer John Holt told MailOnline during an extensive interview today. ‘Telling your children he's gone and then it's kind of a big swirling deal, it's a circus and the kids - now two years later it turns around and it's another nightmare for her and the family. I don't know how she's dealing with it. 'He disappeared cold turkey,’ Holt said. ‘There was never any hint he was still alive. We never heard anything. 'A friend called her saying ""this just happened and you need to know"". She wasn’t notified by law enforcement or anything like that.’ For the couple's children, the news of their father’s mortality is a mixed blessing, Holt said. ‘There is some happiness their father is alive. 'But it turns your heart as a mama and . I think those are the things she's going through because, gosh, she . doesn’t know his story yet.’ When . Price vanished he had sent a suicide note to his family and friends . that authorities chalked-up as a confession to his crimes. He . was indicted for embezzling more than $21m from a small bank in south . Georgia where he worked. On top of that, he was accused of defrauding . more than 100 clients of millions of dollars. Mrs . Price was sitting in the Glynn County criminal court on Thursday when . her husband was brought in to face a raft of federal charges. Contrast: Price, left, before his disappearance and right, after 18 months on the run living like a vagrant . Pot head: Marijuana plants were growing inside the rented home that Price was living in on the run . Dishevelled: . Price told arresting officers that he 'was going to make them famous' after they rumbled him during a routine traffic stop for having tinted . windows that were too dark . He cut a very different figure from the slick banker she knew. Gone was a dress suit and instead he was in a blue jail jumpsuit, his hair shaggy and his skin tanned. Holt said the two have yet to exchange a word. ‘She . went over to the court, but she was unable to see him,’ he said. ‘She . has not talked with him since all of this happened, so that he could . tell her what had occurred.’ ‘She wants answers. He left her children and they were crying aloud after their father committed suicide.’ Asked . if the hardworking math teacher who is raising her four children by . herself wants to remain married now that his appearance reverses her divorce, her lawyer said time will tell. 'Once he appears again in court we get . this order set aside that he's not dead - which will happen here pretty . quick in the next week or two - she's married to him and he's committed . to her marriage spiritually. ‘Rebekah wants to gather all the information herself before she makes any decisions.' It . emerged that the once ‘charismatic Christian preacher’ had been living like a . disheveled vagrant. His Dodge pick-up truck had a silver sleeping bag in the back with a cinder block and a pair of blue jeans. While it's not known exactly how Price survived under the radar - he claimed he was doing odd-jobs for cash - police have revealed that a house he rented in Marion County, Florida, was full of marijuana plants under lights. In all, 225 plants were removed. ‘Holy smoke,’ a shocked Holt said at the revelation. 'Rebekah’s emotions are flipping all over the place and I’m sure she knows about this now.’ Price was last seen on surveillance video in Key West, Florida, boarding a ferry to Fort Meyers. Despite a U.S. Coast Guard search costing over $173,000, his body was never found. Six . months later he was declared dead. Hardship: . Rebekah and her children live in this modest home in Valdosta, Georgia. Her lawyer said that the teacher has been scraping by since his death . and did not get a pay out from his $1m life insurance . Deceit: Price was last seen boarding a ferry in . Florida. He also sent two suicide notes showing his intention to jump . off. He was declared legally dead by a court last year, but the FBI . never believed he had killed himself . Just before Price’s arrest, his wife and her lawyer were beginning to pursue legal action to collect the life insurance policies frozen by a government-hired trustee. ‘There was some life insurance policies out there which was another thing I handled and we were in the process of discussing them. If we couldn't resolve them amicably we were going to proceed with a lawsuit.’ One of the policies Mrs Price was named on was for $300,000 and another for $1million, but her name was scratched shortly before her husband vanished and replaced with one of his shady companies. 'We were negotiating with them at the time he appears,’ Horn conceded. ‘My client is going to lose all of that now that he's turned up alive. On top of that she's got a husband now. I don't know if that's a burden or a bonus to her.’ After he vanished he left his wife, currently carpooling to and from a Gray Middle School in a neighboring county where she teaches math, to work several jobs to make ends meet. ‘She’s a teacher but she was working two to three jobs just to get by at one point, just to survive. He added that she's also dedicated time at the local Boys and Girls club ‘teaching after school classes to kids.’ And she’s been living in a house with a steep mortgage that she’s managed to pay with aid of the Social Security checks that began coming in after her husband was officially deemed dead. Holt said the mortgage was around $1600 a month which he says ‘she won’t be able to pay’ now that his reappearance forced her to stop any future Social Security payments. ‘It’s the right thing to do, but she’s about to be in severe financial distress again.’ As the government begins to mount its prosecution of the banker her lawyer said his wife has been co-operative with authorities and insisted she was completely in the dark over his crimes. But that hasn't stopped her feeling the wrath of his victims. ‘Some of the preacher folks who invested their money were fairly hostile toward Rebekah,' said Holt. The aspersions became so hot that the widow was fearing reprisals.","Aubrey Lee Price arrested on Tuesday in Brunswick, Georgia, after faking his suicide in June 2012 when he was indicted over a $21m bank fraud .

"Extravagant: Khaled Khawaja and Rasha Said held one of the most expensive weddings in recent history . She first made a name for herself by donating money to the Tory party, just as her controversial billionaire father did in the past. But there was nothing conservative about Rasha Said's multimillion-pound wedding at France's Palace of Versailles this weekend. In scenes that defied David Cameron's austerity policies, the 26-year-old London-based socialite staged one of the most expensive marriage celebrations in recent history. The lavish affair was attended by senior Conservatives including International Development Minister Alan Duncan, at the palace that was once home to France’s notoriously spendthrift kings. Miss Said’s wedding to fellow PR worker Khaled Khawaja, 27, featured a two-hour live performance by pop star Robbie Williams and a 15ft-high tiered cake. AAmong the 700 British guests were the Duchess of York and her daughters, the Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, Princess Michael of Kent, Sir Michael Caine, Tory grandee Nicholas Soames, hotelier Sir Rocco Forte and his family, Samantha Cameron’s mother, Viscountess Astor, and Sotheby’s boss Henry Wyndham. It was paid for by 72-year-old tycoon Wafic Said, a close friend of Margaret Thatcher and one of the Tories' most prominent financial backers before being linked with a shady arms deal. Those who accuse Mr Cameron of being an out-of-touch member of the upper classes will also have raised an eyebrow at the presence of his mother-in-law, Viscountess Annabel Astor. Her daughter, Samantha Cameron, frequently tries to play down the family’s privileged background, as does Eton-educated Mr Cameron. Mr Said’s donations were banned during a sleaze crackdown because he was not deemed to be a British resident, but in 2005 Miss Said was recorded as giving £47,000 to the Conservatives. Then a teenager, she would not have had enough money for the donation, prompting claims that she had unlawfully acted as a ‘proxy’ to her father. But the Conservatives said it was a clerical error, and that the money had come from Rosemary Said, Miss Said’s British mother. An enquiry carried out by the Electoral Commission found there had been no wrongdoing, and Miss Said remains a Conservative supporter. On Saturday her family and friends filled Versailles, the palace most commonly associated with the Sun King, Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette. The monarchs’ high living cost them their heads during the 1789 French Revolution, but this weekend's guests had no thought of anything spoiling their merriment as they tucked into a cordon bleu vintage banquet in a resplendent state room. Dressed in black tie and ball gowns, they filed through the world famous Hall of Mirrors, where the Treaty of Versailles was signed to officially end World War I in 1919. On Saturday evening, the revellers were serenaded in the manicured Orangery gardens by Robbie Williams – a singer who is unlikely to provide a private performance for less than £1million. ‘It was an incredible celebration – one that couldn’t be more luxurious,’ said one of the guests. ‘Many of the guests were so rich they arrived by private jets, but even they were surprised by how lavish the whole thing was. 'The whole thing would have cost many millions. People came from all over the world, but there were plenty of Conservative Party supporters from England.’ Opulent surroundings: Revellers at the Palace of Versailles feasted on a cordon bleu banquet and were serenaded by Robbie Williams in the manicured Orangery gardens . Speaking about her big day earlier this year, Miss Said said modestly: ‘We want to keep it very private. It is an occasion just for our family and friends’, but this did not stop well-connected friends posting pictures on social media sites which can be viewed by the general public. These included pictures of the couple preparing to be married, and a photograph of their huge cake. As well as hiring out Versailles, Mr Said organised a pre-wedding celebration and dinner at the Paris Opera on Friday night, filling it with fresh flowers and dancing ballerinas in honour of his only daughter. He had originally wanted the wedding . to take place in Damascus, where he was born, but the ongoing revolution . in Syria made this impossible. The . entire extravaganza in France rivalled the celebrations of another of . Britain’s richest men, steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, whose daughter . Vanisha married at Versailles seven years ago. Mr . Said, who sold a collection of the Duchess of Windsor’s jewels for . almost £8million in 2010, spared no expense for Cheltenham Ladies’ College-educated Miss Said and her new husband, a trainee at Lord Bell’s . PR conglomerate, Chime Communications. Famous faces: Rosemary and Wafic Said, Rasha's parents, welcomed notable figures including International Development Minister Alan Duncan, right, to the high-profile wedding . Despite this, guests were instructed on wedding invitations: ‘Your presence is enough but if you want to buy us a gift we are registered at Harrods.’ The Said family are based in Monaco for tax reasons, but also divide their time between homes in Paris, Marbella, Saudi Arabia and London’s Eaton Square, as well as a £50million Oxfordshire estate. Mr Said admits that he played a ‘small’ role in the controversial 1986 Al Yamamah deal which saw Saudi Arabia buy £40billion worth of fighter planes from the UK amid allegations of bribery. As well as Baroness Thatcher and her son Mark, close personal friends include numerous other senior Conservative politicians and former Labour minister Peter Mandelson. Mr Said gave £25million to Oxford University in 1996 to found the Said Business School, and now travels the world in his own Boeing 737, making business 'deals behind the scenes’. Mr Duncan confirmed he was at the wedding, while Downing Street said they ‘weren’t going to deny’ that Viscountess Astor was there too.","Robbie Williams played in the Orangery and guests enjoyed a grand banquet .

"The Football Association refused to be drawn into a public row with Sol Campbell after the former England defender claimed he was denied the chance to become an established national team captain because the governing body is institutionally racist. Officials at Wembley were left stunned by Campbell’s remarks. Not least because of the support the FA has given to the Kick It Out campaign in combating  racism and the fact that the choice of captain has almost always been the manager’s decision. In a new authorised biography, Campbell, 39, says: ‘I believe if I was white I would’ve been England captain for more than 10 years. It’s as simple as that. Missing out: Sol Campbell was capped 73 times for England but captain just three times . Rare: Campbell was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term . ‘I think the FA wished I was white. I . had the credibility,  performance-wise, to be captain. I was . consistently in the heart of the defence and I was club captain early on . in my career. I don’t think it will change because they don’t want it . to.’ Campbell went on to ask: ‘Are there elements in the FA who are racist? Is the FA always the leader of football it should be?’ He . has been supported in the book, to some extent, by former FA chairman . Lord Triesman. ‘It is more likely if he was white that he would have . captained England more,’ said Triesman. ‘I don’t subscribe to the view . that it (the FA) was consciously  racist but I think there is an . assumption of a type of person who should captain England.’ Campbell also said he did not understand why former Liverpool striker Michael Owen was made captain ahead of him. Influential: The former Tottenham, Arsenal and Portsmouth defender won 73 caps with England . Back then: Campbell celebrates scoring against Sweden in the 2002 World Cup . Leading role: Campbell says Owen was a great striker but was not captain material for the Three Lions . In charge: Emile Heskey (left) and David James (right) have been given the armband during a game . Bobby Moore 90Billy Wright 90Bryan Robson 65David Beckham 59Alan Shearer 34John Terry 34Steven Gerrard 33Kevin Keegan 31Emlyn Hughes 23Bob Crompton 22Johnny Haynes 22Eddie Hapgood 21 . ‘The . more caps I won, the further away I seemed to be pushed from becoming . captain,’ said Campbell. ‘I played well, acted honourably on and off the . field, but there was little recognition. ‘Owen . was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain. It was . embarrassing. I kept asking myself, what have I done? I’ve asked myself . many times why I wasn’t (made captain). I keep coming up with the same . answer. It was the colour of my skin.’ Campbell . became the second youngest skipper after World Cup-winner Bobby Moore . when, aged 23 years and 248 days, he captained England under Glenn . Hoddle against Belgium in 1998. Hoddle . gave him the armband again that year against the Czech Republic. His . third and last game as captain was against the United States in 2005 . when Sven Goran Eriksson was boss. Campbell . played in an era when other black players have worn the armband, Paul . Ince and Rio Ferdinand among them. Had Ferdinand not suffered an injury . shortly before the start of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, . Ferdinand would have been England’s captain in South Africa — albeit . after John Terry, who was originally selected ahead of the Manchester . United defender, had been stripped of the captaincy. Only . recently the FA came under fire when Heather Rabbatts, the first black . and female member of the FA board, pointed out that the commission . appointed by new chairman Greg Dyke to conduct a review of the English . game was exclusively white. David . Davies, the former FA executive director whose time at the governing . body coincided with Campbell’s 73-cap England career, refuted the . accusations. Finally: Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole captains England against Ireland in May after earning 100 caps . Leading the pack: Rio Ferdinand (front centre) is the only black player to be England's official leading captain . Paul Ince... 7 (inc 6 friendlies)Sol Campbell... 3 (3)Rio Ferdinand... 7(4)Ashley Cole... 1 (1) TOTAL... 18 (14) ‘I am . surprised by this because the reality is that in my time the managers . selected the captain,’ Davies told the BBC. ‘I never — and to my . knowledge nobody else in the FA — ever sought to influence them. My . belief is the allegations are wrong. I also have to say I am quite . proud, along with a number of people of that era, of setting up Kick It . Out in football. Progress was made. I would love to talk to Sol about . this concern he has about why he wasn’t the England captain. ‘He . clearly is upset about that time and he feels that perhaps he should . have been, he would believe, more seriously considered as the England . captain.’ A former team-mate . with England and Arsenal, Sportsmail’s Martin Keown was also surprised . by Campbell’s attack. ‘I know Sol very well,’ he said. ‘Yes, he was . deserving of being captain more often but I understand why he wasn’t. I . think Sol could have gone about this in a different way. We have to . respect his view but he could have probably done something on the . inside. We don’t need this sensationalism and I do not know whether this . helps any young black player coming into the game.’ Asked . if Campbell would have made a good England captain, Keown said: ‘Yes. He wasn’t very vocal, more of a visual leader but he was a leader. I . feel disappointed this has come out in this way. He could have spoken to . someone in the FA and tried to explain his story. The FA has to respond . to this. 'We have had black captains and this is dragging us back across a bridge we have already crossed.’","FA refuse to be drawn into public race row over comments .

"'I'm mad about her': The photographer with his fourth wife Catherine . His reputation as a lothario during  his heyday earned him the nickname Big Bad Bailey. Several decades on, with four marriages under his belt and about to turn 75, David Bailey is as controversial as ever. The fashion photographer reveals he still enjoys making love to his 51-year-old wife Catherine, is friends with his ex-girlfriends and ex-wives – and remains unapologetic about his penchant for one night stands. It was a habit which saw him clash with feminist critics in the 1970s. But in a new TV interview he says of . his conquests: ‘Like it’s my fault they slept with me? They had a . choice, it wasn’t rape or anything.’ The . East Londoner, who will be 75 on January 2, is inextricabily linked . with the Swinging Sixties. The Beatles, Mick Jagger and the Kray . brothers all posed for him. He . established himself at Vogue where he took pictures of Jean Shrimpton, . now 70, who was his girlfriend at one stage, and also developed his love . of women. In the past . he has said: ‘You used to be a bad boy if you slept with a lot of . women. And I did. People can’t bear that. I can’t see what’s wrong with . that really.’ In his . interview with Sky Arts programme Living The Life to be screened on . January 8, he says: ‘It was a bit of fun really. I got used, they got . used.’ But he adds: ‘I had a terrible time in the 70s with all those silly feminists.’ In . a previous interview Bailey told how he was brought up by his mother . and aunt after his father walked out when he was young, and said: ‘I was . surrounded by strong women so it had never even occurred to me that . women were anything other than equal to men. ‘Then . all those bloody feminists started attacking me, the silly uptight . cows, having a go because I slept with more than one woman.’ His . girlfriends included Miss Shrimpton, who lasted three years, and his . former muse and model Penelope Tree, who survived eight years. Happy marriage: Model Catherine Dyer appears to have finally tamed Bailey - the couple have three children . Swinging Sixties: David Bailey with Jean Shrimpton in 1963 - the photographer established himself at Vogue taking photos of the model . His . marriage to first wife Rosemary Bramble lasted three years, and his . second, to actress Catherine Deneuve, now 69, lasted two. Third wife . Marie Helvin, 60, was with him for ten. But it is model Catherine Dyer, his fourth wife, who appears to have tamed him. They married in 1986 and she is the only one to present him with children – they have three: Fenton, Sascha and Paloma. And Bailey appears to be as enamoured with her as the day he first set eyes on her. He said: ‘I love making love, I love sex… I am mad about my wife. I think she is the sexiest woman I’ve ever met and we’ve been together for 30 years and if I could choose this moment who I’d sleep with tonight it would be her. If I can persuade her.’ However, Bailey confesses he is still close to most of his former lovers, especially 62-year-old Miss Tree. ‘I love Penelope. I’m mad about her, I think she’s wonderful but we couldn’t live together. ‘All my ex-girlfriends or wives are all kind of great friends and I’ve never understood somebody who can live with somebody for five or six years and then not like them.’",Legendary lothario dated model Jean Shrimpton and married actress Catherine Deneuve before fourth wife Catherine Dyer finally tamed him .
"Dr Mann woke up in an awkward position. From then the slightest movement or touch caused pain . As a GP, Dr Nick Mann is used to seeing people in pain - and as someone . who's suffered from it for years himself, he is particularly . sympathetic. In his 20s he damaged a disc in his neck during a . surfing accident, causing it to bulge or 'slip'. Over the next 12 years, . more of the discs in his neck became damaged, leaving him with chronic . stinging pain in his back, arms and shoulders. But this was nothing compared with what came next. One day Dr Mann woke up having slept in an awkward position. From . then on the slightest movement of his right arm, or even being touched . on his upper back, caused waves of excruciating pain. 'The pain . intensified over several months to the point where, having been able to . carry on ""as normal"" for 12 years despite a series of slipped discs, I . became unable to lift a stethoscope to listen to someone's chest,' explains Dr Mann, 51, who works at an NHS surgery in East London. 'If anyone even gently brushed against my back I would get a jolt of incredible pain and my knees would buckle.' As . well as the pain, his right hand became a mottled red colour. And, most . remarkably, the nails and hair on his arm grew faster, as did the bones . in his right hand - over months it grew bigger than his left hand. His doctor gave him prescriptions for painkillers, but this did nothing. 'There . appeared to be no answers as to why this had happened,' says Dr Mann, . who lives in Hackney, East London, with wife, Karen, 48, and their . children aged 14 and 11. His doctor referred him to a neurosurgeon. 'He treated me like a malingerer,' recalls Dr Mann. 'It was the most . terrifying time of my life. 'I couldn't work and I feared I might . never do so again at that point. My right arm, as well as being painful, . began to lose its power. Despite trying to keep it moving, it gradually . lost strength and co-ordination, until four months later it just hung . uselessly by my side. 'I could do everyday things like write and eat . with a knife and fork but it was extremely hard. My wife was pregnant . with our second son and she did not need another dependent at this . point.' Six months after Dr Mann's symptoms began, an osteopath . suggested the problem might be shoulder-hand syndrome - a form of . complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Suddenly Dr Mann realised he . had a diagnosis. CRPS is a greater-than-normal reaction of the body to . an injury, resulting in a 'scalding' pain at the slightest touch. 'The . pain is so bad that it is not uncommon for people to say they want to . have their affected limb amputated,' says Dr Andreas Goebel, a senior . lecturer in pain medicine at Liverpool University.The syndrome usually affects just one limb, commonly the  arm or leg. Six months after his symptoms began, an osteopath suggested the problem might be shoulder-hand syndrome . As . well as pain, the skin of the affected limb can change colour and may . be warmer or cooler than normal. Hair and nail growth can dramatically . increase or decrease (possibly as the nervous system helps regulate this . growth). In time - generally months - the limbs can become weaker . and frozen in position, not only because it hurts to move them, but . because it becomes physically impossible to do so. Although the . condition was first identified during the American Civil War, CRPS's . cause is as yet not fully understood. However, it's thought to stem from . a problem with the nerves, as it can occur after a major injury to a . nerve. This is referred to as CRPS type  2. It can also occur after . surgery or a mild knock. Around 10  per cent of those who have a . fractured limb will develop it, when it is known as CRPS type 1. 'Just . the trauma of a vaccination is enough to trigger it in some,' says . Candy McCabe, a consultant nurse at the Royal National Hospital for . Rheumatic Diseases in Bath and professor of nursing and pain sciences at . the University of the West of England, Bristol. 'However, in 9 per cent of cases the condition occurs without any obvious injury,' she says.It may also be an autoimmune condition, suggests Dr Goebel. 'We . are looking at the possibility that with CRPS the immune system alters . the way the nerves function - all the symptoms are nerve-related. 'Nerves . can secrete neuropeptides, protein-like molecules that nerve cells use . to communicate with each other, and in excess these can lead to swelling . and discolouration of the skin - as happens with CRPS.' Professor . McCabe adds there is no 'absolute evidence' of this yet. The proportion of people with back pain who can't identify the cause . 'What we do know is that even if it has an autoimmune component, things quite quickly get driven by the brain,' she says. Quite . why limbs should become useless is not clear. 'What we think happens is . that people feel as if they can't use the affected limbs and this in . time alters the way the brain talks to these areas,' says Professor . McCabe. 'This is most common among young females - their joints can . become fixed in an unusual position.' The syndrome is three times . more common in women and is most common among post-menopausal women, . 'which suggests some hormonal element', says Professor McCabe. Physiotherapy . can help keep the joint mobile, 'but it needs to be started as soon as . possible to have best effects and that depends on an early diagnosis', . she adds. Yet although it is not an uncommon condition - affecting . around 16,000 people in Britain - few doctors have heard of CRPS. 'It's . not taught in medical schools, and many doctors will never even have . heard it,' says Professor McCabe. 'There is no definitive test - . diagnosis depends on the patients explaining their symptoms and the . doctor understanding what they mean.' Patients commonly experience a delay in diagnosis and some may be told their symptoms are in the mind, says Professor McCabe. 'Yet . it is a very real condition that can be absolutely horrific. I have . seen tough miners in tears with the pain of this condition.' In 80 . per cent of cases, the condition resolves itself within a year, but for . the rest, the condition can become progressively worse. Patients commonly experience a delay in diagnosis and some may be told their symptoms are in the mind . Morphine and . other strong painkillers have little effect, but nerve blocks - . injections of local anaesthetic into the affected nerves - can help, as . can spinal cord stimulation. This involves having a device fitted into . your abdomen or buttocks that sends electrical pulses to your spinal . cord, which alters how you sense pain. This helps in around half of . all patients, says Dr Goebel. He has recently completed a study using a . drip of immunoglobulin (a form of antibodies used by the immune system). In his study, published in the journal Rheumatology last year, a . weekly infusion stopped the pain symptoms for two sufferers within . months - even though they had been suffering from the condition for five . years. 'We expect it to be effective in a quarter of those with CRPS . and if it is going to be effective it will start working straight . away,' he says. For Dr Mann, the road to recovery after his symptoms . began in 2002 was agonisingly slow. 'I eventually saw an osteopath who . was also a doctor. He thought the problem originated in my upper ribs,' he says. 'After the first treatment manipulating my upper ribs, the . nature of the pain changed totally.' He believes that for many . people with CRPS the upper ribs may be the problem. 'Many CRPS sufferers . report an initial shoulder impact,' he says. 'This can send a force . from the shoulder through to the ribs so that they are a bit like bent . sticks. 'When they're compressed they can rotate slightly. Very small . displacements at the spinal end of the rib can cause small but . important distortion of the sympathetic trunk.' The sympathetic . trunk is a bundle of nerve fibres carrying signals which control, for . example, muscle reflexes, blood flow and pain transmission. If the ribs . are disturbed enough, they can put pressure on these nerves and create . havoc, adds Dr Mann. 'As my ribs were freed with osteopathy my pain . reduced and my hand returned to colour pretty rapidly,' says Dr Mann, . who is now living a full and active life. He believes his experiences made him a better doctor. 'What . happened to me gave me so much insight into how people with long-term . pain suffer,' he says. 'They go to their GP and shuffle out with a . prescription for painkillers or an appointment  to see the . physiotherapist, but  these people keep coming back because no one finds . out why they have this pain. 'Our system deals with the consequences, but has stopped looking for the causes.'","GP Dr Nick Mann from Hackney had form of complex regional pain syndrome .

"A convicted murderer serving a life sentence who is suffering from inoperable cancer has been granted parole so that she can die outside prison walls. Kristina Joy Fetters was just 14-years-old when a jury convicted her of stabbing her 73-year-old great aunt, Arlene Klehm, to death while attempting to rob her house in Polk County, Iowa in 1995. Fetters had escaped a mental institution for juveniles in Des Moines with another girl earlier in the day. Court documents at the time indicate Fetters wanted to take jewelry and money, however her attorneys denied this and mounted an insanity defense. Scroll down for video . Kristina Fetters, 33, is dying of inoperable breast cancer. At 14 she was sentenced to life in prison for murdering her great aunt. After 15 years behind bars, she has been granted compassionate release and will be paroled to a hospice . This is Kristina Fetters in 1995 during her murder trial. She had escaped a mental institution the same day she stabbed her 73-year-old great aunt to death . On October 25, 1995, Kristina Fetters, 14, escaped from an Iowa mental institution before coming here, to the Polk County home of her great aunt and stabbing the 73-year-old to death . She was tried as an adult and given life without parole, becoming the youngest woman in Iowa to have received such a sentence. Now 33, Fetters has been granted compassionate release after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In September she was diagnosed with inoperable State Four breast cancer. The cancer has since spread to different other parts of her body and taken her ability to walk. Fetters is helped each day by trained inmates in the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women’s hospice unit. Sister Sandy Rodemyer, one of the prison volunteers who help Fetters, said there was no point keeping the sick woman in prison. 'What good would it do?' she told KCCI 8. 'She's dying, she's no threat to anybody.' Kristina Fetters has been in prison for 15 years and will now be paroled to a hospice, where she is expected to die from breast cancer . 'Many young people do some pretty dumb things in life, and to make them stay in prison until the day they die in some cases is probably more than society needs to demand from that person,' said Sen. Pam Jochum . The Iowa Parole Board has now determined Fetters, who has been hospitalized for pain recently, would recieve better treatment outside of prison. The board also determined that, while Fetters had not been a model prisoner, she did not pose a threat to society due to her condition. The high court said that life sentences without parole are unconstitutional for juveniles. Fetters family say they have forgiven her for killing her great aunt and that her release 'will bring closure'. Fetters has remained close with her mother, Denise Fetters. 'This has been a 19 year old tragedy for my family,' said Nancy Olson, Fetters' aunt. Should Kristina Fetters respond to hospic cancer treatments, she will likely be returned to prison, pending another parole board review . In a 2009 interview, Fetters said she deserved her sentence and took full responsibility for her actions. 'I take full responsibility,' she said. 'I don't justify - I can't justify - my behavior. 'I took her life.' Pending approval by the 5th Judicial district, Fetters is expected to be moved to hospice care within two weeks.","Kristina Fetters was 14 when she escaped an Iowa mental institution with another girl .

"One of the most shocking Super Bowl ads will feature a real American who is using her time in the spotlight to quit her job. GoDaddy has revealed that one of their two costly ads will feature a woman, whose identity will remain a mystery until Sunday night, who will announce her departure from her current job in the TV spot. The company released a teaser video about the ad this morning with actor John Turtutto walking into a home as he tells how someone is preparing to pursue her dream. Ushering in the quitter: Actor John Turtutto is featured in the teaser that announces how a woman will quit her job in real time as part of a GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial . No clues except the gender of the individual have been released, with her name being bleeped out in the teaser video. 'She's a real person with a real dream of starting her very own business,' Turtutto says. 'She's got a message for her boss in front of a hundred million people.' GoDaddy confirmed the validity of the stunt, issuing a statement saying: ‘Her boss doesn't know! He or she is going to find out while watching the commercial with the rest of the viewers—after the commercial, a formal resignation letter will be delivered and she'll give her two-week notice.’ The company is inevitably trying to make their commercial the latest in a string of very public quitting videos. Mystery: No clues have been revealed about the woman's identity . The most well-known in the genre came from Marina Schifrin, a video editor who filmed a synchronized dance routine to a Kanye West song that listed out her reasons for wanting to leave her job. In case the woman's 'I quit' moment, which the company has called 'gutsy', doesn't become viral, they have a second commercial planned out as well. The second ad, which has been released in full online already, goes along the website domain hosting company's more traditional advertising route. Other route: The company's second Super Bowl ad features shirtless body builders and spokeswoman Danica Patrick . It features a stampede of bare-chested body builders- and company spokeswoman Danica Patrick- racing to a tanning salon after the fictional shop's owner listed it using one of their websites. Advertising experts see the two commercials not as a stunt but as an indication that GoDaddy is attempting to change their public image in a way to support women. 'GoDaddy is evolving its messaging away from sleaze and toward a more respectable focus on women as business owners,' AdWeek speculated. By contrast, their 2013 Super Bowl ad featured model Bar Rafaeli making out with 'geek' Jesse Heiman.","Domain hosting company have teased one of their Super Bowl commercials by saying a woman will quit on air .

"Researchers found those with a spiritual understanding of life were more likely to suffer from mental illness . Being spiritual may give life deeper meaning, but it can also make you more susceptible to mental illness, new research suggests. A study found that people professing to be spiritual, but not conventionally religious, were more likely to suffer from a host of mental challenges. They suffered problems including abnormal eating conditions, drug abuse, anxiety disorder, phobias and neurosis. They were also more likely than others to be taking medication for mental health problems. Professor . Michael King, from University College London, and his fellow . researchers wrote in the British Journal of Psychiatry: 'Our main . finding is that people who had a spiritual understanding of life had . worse mental health than those with an understanding that was neither . religious nor spiritual.' The . study was based on a survey of 7,403 randomly selected men and women in . England who were questioned about their spiritual and religious . beliefs, and mental state. Of the participants, 35 per cent . described themselves as 'religious', meaning they attended a church, . mosque, synagogue or temple. The vast majority of this group were . Christian. A further 19 per cent claimed to have spiritual beliefs or experiences without following a specific religion, while 46 per cent were neither religious nor spiritual. More than nine out of 10 were white British, with an average age of 46. Of the different groups, spiritual people were 50 per cent more likely to have a generalised anxiety disorder and 72 per cent more likely to suffer from a phobia. Spirituality was also associated with a 40 per cent greater likelihood of receiving treatment with psychotropic drugs . They also had a 77 per cent higher chance of being dependent on drugs and were 37 per cent more at risk of neurotic disorder. Spirituality was also associated with a 40 per cent greater likelihood of receiving treatment with psychotropic drugs. Individuals of religious faith and those with none experienced equal levels of mental problems, the study found. But there were fewer problems with drugs or alcohol among the faithful. Unlike some American studies, the new research found no clear relationship between religious belief and happiness. One recent large internet study in the US reported that non-religious people with spiritual beliefs were emotionally less stable than other groups. However, they made up only 2 per cent of the study sample. The researchers wrote: 'We conclude that there is increasing evidence that people who profess spiritual beliefs in the absence of a religious framework are more vulnerable to mental disorder. 'The nature of this association needs greater examination in qualitative and in prospective quantitative research.'",Researchers at University College London say spiritual believers are more likely to suffer problems such as eating conditions or an anxiety disorder .
"A teenager who was sentenced to 25 years and would have served some time in adult prison after pleading guilty aged 12 to helping kill a friend's stepfather could leave a juvenile prison as early as next summer under a deal with prosecutors. Paul Gingerich, 15, had successfully appealed his case being waived to adult court. He agreed on Monday to plead guilty to the same conspiracy to commit murder charge he did three years ago and to receive the same 25-year sentence, only under a starkly different state law. The new deal calls for a 30-year sentence with five years suspended, meaning he'll remain under state supervision for 25 years in Indiana. Paul Gingerich pleaded guilty in November 2010 to conspiracy to commit murder. He is now 15 and could leave juvenile prison as early as next summer . Gingerich was sentenced to 25 years in prison for helping kill a friend's stepfather after being tried in an adult court at the age of 12 . Where he spends those years will depend on how he behaves. He could serve that time in a maximum-security facility if he gets in trouble, or in a group home, community corrections, on probation or even on parole if he's well-behaved. Gingerich will remain at Pendleton Juvenile Facility until he achieves his high school diploma in the prison school around summer 2014, according to indystar.com. Then the teenager will be transferred to a residential treatment facility and begin college classes. He will likely stay there until he is 18. At that age, he could be released on probation under the new deal - as long as he keeps up the good behavior. 'He committed a serious crime. But to send him to adult prison would guarantee we will create a criminal,' said his attorney Monica Foster. The law does allow a judge to drop all supervision, but Foster told Judge James Heuer that the plea agreement doesn't allow for that for Gingerich. The case involves the fatal shooting of 49-year-old Phillip Danner on April 20, 2010, in his home near Lake Wawasee, about halfway between Fort Wayne and South Bend. Danner's 15-year-old son pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in September 2010 in exchange for prosecutors dropping charges of murder and aiding murder. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Victim: Paul Gingerich was found guilty of conspiring to fatally shoot 49-year-old Phillip Danner (pictured) Authorities said the pair and another boy who served as lookout conspired for more than a month to kill Danner so they could run away to Arizona. Danner's death was discovered after . officers checking reports of a suspicious vehicle stopped the three at a . Wal-Mart store in Peru, Illinois, and called authorities in Kosciusko . County to ask them to check on Danner. Gingerich, . who was a sixth-grader at Wawassee Middle School at the time of the . shooting, pleaded guilty in November 2010 to conspiracy to commit . murder. The new plea . agreement was worked out after the Indiana Court of Appeals last year . threw out Gingerich's guilty plea and sentence, saying Kosciusko County . Superior Judge Duane Huffer rushed when he waived the case to adult . court. A new law that went . into effect July 1 allows a judge to sentence a juvenile to serve time . in the Indiana Department of Correction's youth services division and . allows the judge to review the case for a possible sentencing . modification before the defendant turns 19. 'It applies very well in this case,' Prosecutor Daniel Hampton said. Hampton said he had talked with Danner's family and they approved of the new deal. Five members of the Danner family were in court for Monday's hearing, but they left without comment. Gingerich's parents also attended and declined to comment afterward. Gingerich, who wore a green short-sleeve shirt, tan pants and white sneakers, repeatedly answered, 'Yes, your honor,' when Judge James Heuer asked whether he understood his rights and what was going on. Sentencing is set for December 16. 'You understand you could serve the full sentence?' Heuer asked. 'Yes your honor,' Gingerich replied. Tough life: Gingerich now 15, has been described as a role model at Pendleton Juvenile Correction Facility where he is currently incarcerated . Foster told Heuer that Gingerich has been a model prisoner and plans to try to earn a college degree. She believes he will be moved to a group home this summer after he receives his high school diploma. How much freedom he has will depend on the group home he is assigned, she said, but she expects him to be given more and more freedom over time. The law calls for a judge to hold a hearing as soon as possible after Gingerich turns 18 to determine where he should be placed based on the rehabilitative programs he has completed and how he has behaved. Foster said the new law has worked well for Gingerich but that some defense attorneys fear it could lead to more youths being waived to adult court.",Paul Gingerich was a sixth-grader at the time of the shooting of his friend's stepfather in Indiana .
"An Ohio woman and her ex-boyfriend pleaded guilty today in the killing of her 18-month-old daughter, whose remains were found in a box in a garage three months after she was reported missing. Steven King II, the 24-year-old ex-boyfriend of mother Angela Steinfurth, told a Toledo judge that he had found the girl, Elaina Steinfurth, injured in her bedroom and that he tried to resuscitate her. He said he then smothered her to death and put her in a box. The girl's remains were found in September in the rafters of a garage that belongs to King's family. The girl's mother, Angela Steinfurt (pictured in court today in Ohio), entered a type of guilty plea to murder and obstructing justice . Steven King II (pictured left, in the Ohio court today) pleaded guilty in the killing of Elaina Steinfurth . 'I knew what I did was wrong,' King said today.

Steinfurth entered a type of guilty plea to murder and obstructing . justice under which she maintains her innocence but acknowledges . prosecutors had enough evidence to convict her, North West Ohio reported. She was sentenced to 18 years to life in prison in accordance with her plea deal. She did not make a statement in court today. Prosecutors said Steinfurth was upset when the toddler wouldn't stop crying, and she tossed the child across her bedroom. Miss Steinfurth knew Elaina (pictured) had been  injured and didn't seek medical attention . Steven King, II, center, was escorted to the hearing at Lucas County Common Please Court in Toledo, Ohio, today . The child suffered severe injuries, and the next day Steinfurth noticed the baby wasn't breathing well. Prosecutors said that's when King killed the baby. Angela Steinfurth and her two daughters stayed with King at his family's home on June 1, investigators have said. Elaina's . father, Terry Steinfurth, went to the residence to pick up his two . daughters the next day, but only Elaina's four-year-old sister could be . found. Authorities searched . homes, vacant buildings and the Maumee River near downtown for any sign . of Elaina while volunteers looked through neighborhoods and parks. DNA tests confirmed the skeletal remains found in the garage were of Elaina. Gruesome discovery: Officers searching the garage of Steven King II's family (pictured) found Elaina's remains stuffed in a computer box in the rafters . Terry Steinfurth told the court Tuesday that he can't understand how anyone could harm an innocent child. 'The loss of Eliana has left my entire family with a gaping hole in our heart,' he said.

"When Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming lost control of 50 nuclear, inter-continental missiles last October, officials said a communication failure between the control centre and the weapons was to blame. However, three missile technicians stationed at the base have raised fresh questions in the case, amid reports UFO sightings coincided with the incident. UFO researcher Robert Hastings says eyewitnesses claim the interruption to the power supply also lasted much longer than the Air Force admits. Cover-up claims: Missile technicians stationed at Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming have reported UFO sightings coinciding with October's power outage . A power failure on October 23, 2010 meant that one-ninth . of America’s nuclear arsenal went offline for almost an hour. A U.S. Air Force spokesman said there . had been a 'hardware issue' relating to an underground cable linking . the command centre with the missiles. This disrupted ‘communication . between the control centre and the missiles, but during that time they . were still able to monitor the security of the affected missiles’. Defence officials insisted there was never any danger of an accidental launch. But the incident was . deemed serious enough for Barack Obama to be briefed on it later. Speaking out: UFO researcher Robert Hastings says three eyewitnesses have come forward to him on the condition of anonymity . There was no evidence of foul play . and the U.S. never lost the capability to launch the missiles, although . it could only have done so from an airborne command and control centre, . he said. Another official said there had been similar breakdowns on other bases in the past. But Robert Hastings says more was involved. According to Hastings, three missile maintenance technicians have agreed to speak to him on the condition of anonymity, revealing the military has kept UFO sightings that occurred during the power outage under wraps. The witnesses, he said, reported sightings of 'a large cigar-shaped object high above the missile field'. Minuteman missile: Computer breakdown meant the U.S. Air Force lost control for 59 minutes, officials say . Hastings told AOL: 'They said the object was seen in the . sky above the field, throughout the weekend, both during the (missile) disruption and the following day.' His witnesses claim the power outage lasted several hours longer than officials reported. 'I have detailed information about the events. The Air Force said this (missile) disruption lasted 59 minutes. It actually lasted the better part of 26 hours,' he said. 'It was intermittent and involved a very specific sequence of these five missile alert facilities going on and offline. I have all of that down to the most minute detail.' Blast: A Minuteman nuclear-tipped missile takes off from its launch facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida . The eyewitnesses agreed that what they saw 'was not a commercial blimp.' 'It had no passenger gondola and no advertising on its hull,' Hastings said. 'Further, its aspect ratio (length to width) was very similar to a WWI Zeppelin: long and thin, and not at all like the squat shape of a corporate blimp.' The witnesses did not, however, claim the alleged UFO was connected with the outage. It is not the first time Hastings has reported UFO sightings at nuclear missile sites. Going public: Captain Robert Salas accused the U.S. Air Force of lying in September . He organised a press conference last September, when six former Air Force officers stepped forward to reveal they had seen or had been involved with sightings at missile sites. They claim that since 1948, aliens have been hovering over UK and U.S. nuclear missile sites and deactivating the weapons - once even landing in . a British base. The men said they were encouraged not to speak to the media about their sightings. Captain Robert Salas, who was among the six, confirmed: ‘We’re talking about unidentified flying objects, . as simple as that.' However, Lieutenant Colonel John Thomas, director of public affairs for Air Force Global Strike Command headquarters at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, denies there is a policy to silence eyewitnesses to unexplained phenomena at Air Force bases. 'I have no reason to dispute anybody's claims of anything they may . seen historically, because those occurrences and reports took place . decades into the past and probably will decades into the future,' he told AOL. 'This incident is separate from all of that. We took it very . seriously and we're very confident that we understand fully what . happened.' 'If people see things that are unusual, they are encouraged to report . them,' he said, adding: 'When people join the military, they don't give up their First Amendment rights.'","50 nuclear weapons lost touch with control centre .

'My long-term plan is to take care of myself and my health,' she said. Recently retired porn performer described some of the struggles Bay will likely face. 'There's . no health insurance, there's no union; there really isn't a safety . net,' Aurora Snow told the LA Times. 'I feel really bad for her. It's . got to be really tough to get that kind of news.' Cameron revealed . she shot her most recent sex . scene with Xander Corvus, the man who played Anthony Weiner alongside . the New York mayoral candidate's latest online mistress Sydney Leathers. Sydney made her porn debut Weiner And Me - sparking fears she may have been exposed to the virus. Arrest: Cameron Bay seen in here in mugshots from some of her multiple arrests while in Arizona . Porn Star: Her arrests range from traffic violations to forgery and even assault . MailOnline . exclusively revealed Bay's criminal past this week. The performer's rap . sheet shows more than 17 charges to her name, some of which were . dismissed. She also spent more than a year in prison in Arizona 2007. Her charges range from traffic violations to forgery and aggravated assault. Cameron Bay is not the porn star's real name. MailOnline knows her true identity, but has chosen not to print it. Cameron . has worked under names including Ashton and Ryder, but before she . embarked on a career in porn she appeared on VH1's Tool Academy in 2009. The . show centers around couples who are sent to relationship boot camp in . order to save their unions. The season ran for eight episodes, and . Cameron along with her boyfriend of 10 years, Clarence - who had . nicknamed himself 'Celebrity' - were eliminated in the third episode. Just . two years before her reality TV debut, Cameron spent a year and six . months in prison for an unknown offense in Arizona. She was released in May 2008. Her latest arrest came in February, where she was arrested for criminal damage and disorderly conduct. She was also arrested in October last year for criminal damage, disorderly conduct and interfering with judicial proceedings. While in August, she was arrested for failing to show her driving license or identification. Debut: Sydney Leathers porn movie was released yesterday where she stars alongside Xander Corvus . Risk: Xander Corvus, left, who played Weiner in the movie with Sydney Leathers, had unprotected sex with Cameron Bay, right, a few weeks ago - who has just been told she has HIV . Cameron Bay spoke to Adult Video News to confirm she was the performer responsible for the moratorium on porn production. Cutting Edge Testing lab told Bay on Wednesday that a blood sample drawn the previous day came back positive for HIV. She told AVN that she was 'obviously extremely distraught and in . disbelief', and that an additional test will be conducted to confirm the . result. According to Bay, she received her last clean bill of health on July 27. Just days later she filmed an unprotected sex scene for a series called Public Disgrace. Her male partner was Xander Corvus. Gawker reports he and Leathers also had unprotected sex for the Vivid.com movie. X-rated video: Xander and Leathers (pictured above) starred in the porn film together, and Leathers said she did have 'some boundaries' when shooting the movie . In a statement to the site, Leathers . said both she and Xander got tested prior to shooting their scene, and . both were deemed 'healthy'. However, the presence of STDs sometimes does not come up in tests for up to three months after exposure. It . takes the body two-to-eight weeks to make antibodies against HIV - . known as the window period. Tests done immediately after the exposure or . within this window period may not detect the virus and give a false . negative result. The CDC . recommends that individuals who have been exposed to HIV and have been . found negative before three months have elapsed get retested after three . months. Leathers released a further statement this morning: 'I do not have HIV and have not been exposed to HIV regardless of the reports out there saying otherwise. 'I was not contacted by the Free Speech Coalition to re-test, I reached out to them to see if I should re-test and was told I did not need to. 'I took all the necessary precautions before and after my scene for Vivid and acted responsibly and therefore was able to protect myself from exposure to anything. 'As an added precaution I retested 2 days after my shoot and again yesterday and was negative.' Diane Duke, executive director of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, told the Associated Press in an e-mail about the HIV detection: 'The moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated. Virus: Cameron Bay, who has appeared in adult films since 2010, confirmed last night she was the performer responsible for the moratorium . 'In fact, since 2004 there have only been two cases of performers . testing positive for HIV and neither of those situations involved on-set . transmission,' Duke said. 'The current situation would bring the number . to three cases in nearly 10 years, not just in Los Angeles but . nationwide.' The industry briefly put a similar . moratorium in place last year after nearly a dozen performers were . infected during a syphilis outbreak. Word . of the latest moratorium quickly drew critical responses from porn . industry opponents. Among them was Michael Weinstein, whose group the . AIDS Healthcare Foundation successfully lobbied voters last year to . adopt an ordinance requiring actors use condoms in the making of most . porn films. 'How many adult film performers have to become infected with an array of preventable sexually transmitted diseases — including HIV, which is not curable — before the porn industry actually complies with the law requiring condom use,' he said in a statement. Since the ordinance's adoption, county officials have said they are investigating one violation. Assemblyman Isadore Hall III, who is pushing for the state to adopt a similar law, called Wednesday's news 'devastating and preventable.' 'Exposing workers to this type of harm would not be accepted in any other industry in this nation,' the Los Angeles Democrat said. The industry, which says its audience does not want to see condoms, is fighting the Los Angeles County measure in court.

"David Cameron suffered a bloody nose over his  NHS reforms yesterday, losing a surprise vote in the House of Lords as senior ministers urged him to drop the Bill altogether. Peers passed an amendment to the legislation demanding more money for mental health services by 244 votes to 240 – with three Lib Dem rebels voting against the Government. The Bill had already been mauled in the Lords, with the Government tabling 137 amendments to it last week to appease the Liberal Democrats. Whoa! David Cameron took a battering at PMQs over the controversial NHS bill, with Ed Miliband (right) urging a U-turn, and the Prime Minister was later handed another embarrassing defeat by the House of Lords over mental health changes . Yesterday, before the defeat, the . Prime Minister had earlier offered only lukewarm support to his . embattled Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in riposte to an attack by . Labour leader Ed Miliband, saying: ‘The career prospects for my right . honourable friend (Mr Lansley) are a lot better than his.’ Insiders still expect Mr Lansley to be . moved at the next reshuffle after briefings from No.10 insiders that . they want him ‘taken out and shot’ for his failure to sell the reforms . to a sceptical public. NHS reform: The proposed changes . A senior minister said that  disquiet . is so advanced in Tory ranks that Cabinet members had urged Mr Cameron . to drop the Bill in recent weeks. The UK Faculty of Public Health today . became the latest in a string of professional healthcare bodies to call . for the Bill to be scrapped. A survey of members found that 93 per . cent believed the Bill would damage the NHS and the health of people in . England and three-quarters wanted the Faculty to demand its withdrawal. Faculty president Professor Lindsey . Davies said: 'We are now calling on the Government to withdraw the Bill . in its entirety, because it would be in the best interests of everyone's . health. 'Our 3,300 members - experts in . planning and providing for people's health - have been closely involved . in trying to make the Government's proposed reforms work since they were . first introduced. 'Based on our members' expert views, . it has become increasingly clear that the Bill will lead to a . disorganised NHS with increased health inequalities, more bureaucracy . and wasted public funds. 'The Bill will increase health . inequalities because there is the real danger that vulnerable groups . like homeless people will not be included when health services are being . planned. Clinical commissioning groups and service providers will be . able to pick and choose what procedures they perform and which services . they put in place.' The Faculty voiced concerns about how . emergency planning, screening and immunisation services will work under . the Bill, which it said would leave the NHS with a shortage of strategic . leadership and a lack of clarity about what happens if a private . provider goes bankrupt. Sources close to the Prime Minister . denied that he ever considered that option but the minister said: ‘There . is a case for abandoning the whole thing.’ Tory strategists fear that Mr . Lansley’s failure to win over doctors or patients to his reforms will be . used by Labour as a political battering ram. ‘No Tory MP knows what the point of . these reforms is any more,’ one Tory MP said. ‘I would be surprised if . Lansley was still here in a year.’ Senior sources talked down the defeat . in the Lords, pointing out that the mental health amendment was more a . technical disagreement than a fundamental challenge to the principles of . the Bill. But one source predicted a ‘few bloody noses’ as the Bill . continues its passage through the Lords. In the Commons Mr Miliband said the . Bill would introduce the biggest shake-up since the founding of the NHS . in 1948 and would put GPs in control of much of the NHS budget. ‘This is a matter of trust in the . Prime Minister,’ Mr Miliband told MPs. ‘Can he honestly look people in . the Health Service in the eye and say he’s kept his promise of no more . top-down reorganisation? ‘He knows in his heart of hearts that this is a complete disaster. ‘The reality about this Bill is this: . the doctors know it’s bad for the NHS, the nurses know it’s bad for the . NHS and patients know it’s bad for the NHS.’ Mr Cameron hit back, saying that the . NHS in England under the Coalition is doing better than Wales’s Health . Service, which is run by Labour and has been subjected to £400million in . spending cuts. He also accused Mr Miliband of using . the furore over the Bill to boost his personal standing with his party, . saying: ‘This is not a campaign to save the NHS, this is a campaign to . try and save your leadership.’","Peers defeat government with majority of four votes .

"Franz Muller, known as the first train murderer, was hanged for the killing of Thomas Briggs in 1864 . It was the story that gripped the nation: a well-to-banker bludgeoned to death in a first-class train carriage on his way home from work. The suspect then fled abroad and, in what must be the slowest police chase ever, a Metropolitan Police detective chased him by boat across the Atlantic before he could make his arrest. Such was the interest in the murder of 70-year-old Thomas Briggs on the 9.45pm train from Fenchurch Street to Hackney Wick on 9 July 1864, it even knocked the American Civil War off the front pages. The first sign of the crime was when two young men walked into the empty carriage and sat down to discover the seats and walls were drenched in blood. There was a bloodied handprint on the window, and ladies in the carriages beyond complained that tiny droplets of blood had come flying through the open window, flecking their dresses. But there was no sign of the victim. A couple of hours later a man was found, barely alive, beside the tracks near Bow.  Thomas Briggs, a respectable City banker and father of four, was missing his left ear, his gold watch, and his top hat, and he died soon after from his injuries. He was the first person to be murdered on a train - and Victorian Britain was scandalised. If . such a murder - the subject of a new BBC documentary to be broadast . next week - could happen in first-class, then anyone could 'be slain in . our pew at church', raged one newspaper, also suggesting readers might . now expect to be 'assassinated at our dinner table'. Historian . Kate Colquhoun, whose book Mr Briggs' Hat: A Sensational Account Of . Britain's First Railway Murder, tells the story of the killing, says the . effect of the murder on the nation was similar to that of the terrorist . attacks in London and New York. A Victorian drawing of banker Thomas Briggs and the hunt to find his killer after he was murdered on a train . 'There was this great sense of ""We thought we were safe"", and everyone was stunned to realise that actually, they weren't,' she told MailOnline. 'Thomas Briggs was white, middle-class, respectable, and in a first-class carriage.  If he could be murdered, there, then no-one was safe - any of us could be plunged into this new kind of hell.' The British public, so proud of their newly-industrialised nation and its railways, became gripped by the mystery surrounding the killer. In the carriage, police found a hat . that Mr Briggs' family insisted was not his, and detective Richard . Tanner decided that if he could find out who it belonged to, he would . find the murderer. Tenacious: Metropolitan Police's Richard Tanner, played by Robert Whitelock in the BBC's new documentary . A reward of £300, equivalent to several years' wages, was offered for information, and a cabbie came forward to say he knew the hat belonged to a German immigrant tailor called Franz Muller. Muller's landlady in the East End said she had seen him wearing a new watch that matched the victim's, and police followed the trail to London docks, where Muller had boarded a wooden sailing ship bound for New York within a week of the murder. Detective Tanner took the train to Liverpool and got on a faster steamer bound for New York, arriving three weeks before his target. The train's cabman Jonathan Matthews, played by Jim Conway in the BBC documentary . A train driver on the North London line, Alfred Ekin (played by David Nellist) discovered Brigg's body by the track . He had to keep his head down in America, where the Civil War was raging and Englishmen were not welcome. Ms Colquhoun said: 'People in New York knew that Tanner was there waiting for Muller's ship, and they turned out to greet every ship arriving from London in case Muller was on it. 'It was not an easy place for Tanner to be.' Author Kate Colquhoun . But with a fevered British public back home waiting eagerly for news of an arrest, Tanner was determined to get his man. When finally Muller's ship came in, Tanner confronted him and found he had both Briggs' watch and a silk top matching the victim's. But the suspect's mild manner confused the detective. Ms Colquhoun said: 'When he was arrested he seemed surprised, and the ship's captain remarked how he read Dickens appreciatively on the journey to America.' A baying mob waited for Muller in London, but at his trial at the Old Bailey, his manner continued to confound those expecting to see a brutal killer. The short, young foreigner barely spoke in court, and blushed when he was offered a chair to sit on in the dock. No murder weapon was found, but Muller was found guilty and wept in court as the verdict was announced. Four months later, he was hanged at Newgate in front of a bloodthirsty crowd. Ben Addis plays Frederick Wicks, a journalist covering the murder case that gripped Victorian Britain . Jonathan Matthews, played by Jim Conway, pictured, was the cabman on the train where banker Thomas Briggs was murdered . Ms Colquhoun said: 'The crowd at his hanging was enormous: there were 40,000 people packed into the small, narrow streets around Newgate and the Old Bailey. 'People were drunk, they were swearing - it was the biggest and noisiest crowd at a public hanging in living memory.' Muller cut a dignified figure as he made his way to the scaffold, and - according to his priest and confessor - made a last-minute confession to him, saying 'Ich habe es getan' (I did it) moments before he swung. Such was the size and behaviour of the crowd that it led directly to the banning of public hangings - a few years later, popular disgust at public hangings meant that they were moved behind prison walls. Historian Ms Colquhoun said that despite the convicted killer being hanged, the Victorian public never felt they got the full story behind the bloody killing. 'My feeling is that Muller did it, but that he didn't set out to murder,' she said.  'Perhaps it was a robbery that went wrong, and he did not think that he had killed Thomas Briggs. 'That would account for his surprise when he was arrested. 'It was a prickly story for a hugely interested British public, and although they felt they had got their man, they never quite felt they got to the bottom of it.'

"Rattled David Cameron has been forced to come out fighting to save his NHS reforms and prevent Health Secretary Andrew Lansley falling victim to a dirty tricks plot by Cabinet Ministers. In an angry meeting at No 10, he thumped the table as he vowed to press ahead with the changes, saying: ‘We’ve not shed blood on these proposals not to go through with them.’ Last night he stepped up his offensive, reading the riot act to rebel Ministers, pledging his ‘100 per cent’ support for embattled Mr Lansley, and declaring he is ‘absolutely determined’ not to do a U-turn on the health shake-up. Coming out fighting: David Cameron, the Prime Minister, left, last night stepped up his offensive as he tries to save his controversial NHS reforms and the career of his Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley, right . But Mr Cameron faced a fierce counter-attack by Tory MP and  ex-nurse Nadine Dorries, who supports the reforms and claims No 10 had encouraged Ministers to ‘smear’ Mr Lansley. ‘Lansley is toast. It is clear that Cameron wants to kill his own NHS Bill – and Andrew Lansley’s career with it,’ she writes in today’s Mail on Sunday. She says that instead of pillorying Mr Lansley, No 10 should have advised him on how to explain his reforms to patients. Counter-attack: Tory MP Nadine Dorries has laid into Mr Cameron, claiming No 10 had encouraged Ministers to 'smear' Mr Lansley . The escalation in the NHS row came after three unnamed Cabinet Ministers used a Tory website to call for the Bill to be scrapped. Mr Cameron said yesterday: ‘Andrew Lansley has my 100 per cent support. He is a very strong Health Secretary and is staying  in his job.’ And in a warning shot to Mr Lansley’s Cabinet enemies, a Downing Street spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister is quite clear – the collective responsibility of the Cabinet means that Mr Lansley has its full support.’ Mr Cameron called the rebel Ministers’ bluff by challenging them to repeat their private criticism of Mr Lansley to him. The spokesman said: ‘No one has raised this issue with him either before or after these reports appeared.’ In a further sign of his concern, Mr Cameron referred to the way the NHS helped him and wife Samantha cope with their disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009, as proof of his personal faith in the health service. He said: ‘The reforms are necessary; I am totally committed to the NHS; I and my family have personal experience  of it and I want it to remain free at the point of use.’ He plans to take personal charge of the NHS changes following a loss of confidence in Mr Lansley among voters and Ministers alike. Mr Cameron will visit a hospital this week in a public display of his commitment to the NHS and plans a series of interviews spelling out why the changes are needed.

Education Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson and Leader of the Commons Sir George Young are also said to be worried about the reform plan. By NADINE DORRIES . Updated: . 03:22 EST, 13 February 2012 . Last week a prominent political journalist wrote that a No 10 aide had said: ‘Lansley should be taken out and shot.’ Let’s get one thing straight: if you work in No 10 and you say something like that to a newspaper, you absolutely know it is going to be reported and you would only say it if you had been told to say it – or you wanted to lose your job. No 10 aides aren’t known for their professional kamikaze tendencies so it has to be assumed that whoever said it was acting under orders. 'Machiavellian tendencies': Ms Dorries, right, says the order to smear Mr Lansley was 'most likely' given by Chancellor Osborne, left, as part of an orchestrated campaign against the Health Secretary . In my view, those orders are most likely to have been issued by George Osborne, who knocks the Machiavellian tendencies of Gordon Brown into the shadows. Such a briefing sends a clear message to Ministers: it was code for the Prime Minister’s general direction of travel. It said: ‘Feel free to start smearing Lansley.’ David Cameron’s endorsement of Lansley in the Commons on Wednesday, when he told Ed  Miliband that Lansley’s chance of holding on to his job was ‘safer than yours’, was conspicuously tepid, bearing in mind Miliband’s dismal ratings. There is only one conclusion: Lansley is toast. The same No 10 aide also mooted the possibility of former Labour Minister Alan Milburn being appointed to the Lords and put in charge of overseeing the NHS reforms. Again, it is my view that this was a carefully calculated, deliberate leak. There was never a more vexatious piece of legislation than the NHS Bill, which Lansley has been immersed in for seven years. His reforms run through every vein and artery of the NHS and are exactly the kind of changes a blue-sky-thinking Conservative Government should be implementing. These are reforms, I might add, that Cameron supported, before the Liberal Democrats mutilated the Bill with hundreds of amendments. It should have been a winner: Unfortunately, Mr Lansley's attention to detail made it almost impossible for him to speak about the reforms in terms people could understand, Ms Dorries says . The NHS reforms were being worked out long before we were in a coalition and the initial Bill was Conservative to its core, as far from a Liberal Democrat top-heavy view of the NHS as you could possibly get. The irony is that, originally, it wasn’t that difficult to sell. Messages which articulated the fact that GPs became holders of budgets which empowered patients and put them in the driving seat were clear and simple to get over. All patients needed to be told was that they would be able to sit in front of a GP and ask: ‘You hold the purse strings now, why can’t I have that drug?’ It should have been a winner with the public. Unfortunately, Lansley’s attention to detail made it almost impossible for him to speak about the reforms in terms people could understand. He is a man of exceptional intelligence but speaks in the jargon of integrated care pathways, learning networks and triggers for intervention. The reforms are highly complex and No 10 should have helped Lansley to explain them. Instead they have left him to his fate. Then Nick Clegg’s chippy Lib Dems got their teeth into the Bill. They have caused so much mischief, you could be forgiven for forgetting we are in a coalition. They may have only 52 MPs, but they display the arrogance of a party that knows it holds the balance of power – even though they face annihilation at the next General Election. Machinations: Mr Cameron, center, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, background left, and Mr Lansley, on a visit to a patient ward at Frimley Park hospital in April last year . It is clear that Cameron wants  to kill his own NHS Bill – and Lansley’s career with it. Now that Downing Street has started to smear one of its own Secretaries of State, confidence in the Bill and Lansley – a dedicated and loyal public servant, whose only crime has been to apply his immense intelligence and Conservative principles with absolute dedication – will collapse. A new Secretary of State will be appointed to carry the changes through to a natural conclusion. Many have already been put in place. Primary Health Care Trusts have all but gone; GPs have organised themselves into consortiums; hospitals have adapted. What is left of Lansley’s reforms will be jettisoned. No doubt it will placate Clegg, but at the expense of a better health service. I fear the malicious briefings will continue and Lansley will be replaced as soon as Cameron and Clegg can agree upon a replacement ready to please the Lib Dems. Sadly, it merely goes to show just how far Cameron has removed himself from core Conservative principles.","Prime Minister pledges his '100 per cent' support for Health Secretary .

"Danny and will.i.am's war of words gets heated . will.i.am defies critics by live tweeting his critiques as he says them . Most contestants on talent shows are happy to be told they managed to perform a song just as well as the original artist. But Bo Bruce impressed so much with her rendition of Rihanna's Love The Way You Lie that will.i.am told her she'd sung it 'a million times better' than the Grammy-winner. The 27-year-old Team Danny contestant said before hitting the stage on tonight's episode of The Voice that she was determined to try a stronger, more powerful style than previous performances. 'Bo... woah!' Bo Bruce impressed the judges on Saturdays night's The Voice with her rendition of Rihanna's Love The Way You Lie . And she pulled it off, getting all four of the coaches on their feet applauding. 'I love the way you lie, the way you sing, the way you move around the stage, everything,' said Bo's coach Danny afterwards. 'The way you sing is the sort of thing I like,' said will. 'You sang that a million times better than Rihanna. Bo... woah!' High praise: will.i.am told the 27-year-old that she sang the track 'a million times better than Rihanna' 'You are someone that makes this whole competition versatile' added Jessie J. Saturday's episode got off to a shaky start for Jessie's team performance. The Price Tag singer halted proceedings, saying her mic pack was not turned on. 'I apologise to everyone at home,' she said, 'but this is live TV, and Team Jessie do it right, I want it absolutely perfect.' Whoops! Jessie J halted her team's group performance when her mic pack was switched off . 'Sorry to everyone at home': The singer apologised for the technical glitch . First up of the solo performances was Max, who sang Black Horse and the Cherry Tree. The singer was using a loop pedal for his performance, and he spoke of his nerves beforehand of messing it up, but it went off without a hitch. 'It was a great performance, but these are almost the finals and the song selection wasn't the greatest,' said will.i.am. Off and running: The group started again and got through the performance . Risk taker: Max, for Team Danny, impressed with his performance using a loop pedal . Danny quizzed will on what he would have sung (in the first of a number of clashes between the two throughout the show), but will just replied: 'I wouldn't have sung that song.' Jessie agreed: 'It was such a risk and I applaud you for doing it. With the song choice, I felt you could have spun it differently.' 'As far as I'm concerned, Max entertained me,' said Tom. 'I loved it. As an artist to take the path you know but sometimes you have to go off road. And Max went off road tonight. I loved it.' 'Getting stronger': Cassius was nervous but won the coaches over with his rendition of Adele's Turning Tables . Next up was Cassius, who took on Adele's Turning Tables. Jessie was full of praise for her nervous contestant, but added: 'I would have liked to have seen you turn around and face us a bit more, but other than that I loved it.' 'You seem stronger and stronger,' said Tom. 'To take a well known song like that, more power to you.' 'I don't know if it was strong enough to get you through to the next round,' said Danny. 'I wanted to heat things up': Vince, from Team Jessie, put a reggae spin on My Love Is Your Love by Whitney Houston . 'Out of all the singers on Team Jessie, you're my favourite,' said will. Vince, from Team Jessie, was next, putting a reggae spin on My Love Is Your Love by Whitney Houston. 'You know what I love about Vince, he came to me with the production for that, how he dressed, the lighting, the staging,' said Jessie. 'It's a pleasure to work with someone like that.' 'He doesn't sound like anybody else, he sounds like himself,' said Tom. 'He has such a great vocal range.' Teen dream: 17-year-old Aleks performed Jack Johnson's Better Together . Taking it easy: The teen said he wanted his performance to be a chilled-out break in between all the powerful voices throughout the night . 'I love your vocal, you could sing the phone book and it would sound good,' added Danny. Will defied critics of his tweeting during the live shows, by giving his critique of Vince 'double time' - tweeting his opinion as he spoke it. 'Ring the alarm. Vince is the bomb.com,' he said. Aleks was next up for Team Danny. Danny had suggested the singer perform Jet's Are You Gonna Be My Girl, but the 17-year-old was adamant that he sing something more his style, so they settled on Better Together by Jack Johnson. 'That is the sound of the whole of the UK's heart breaking,' said Danny afterwards. Rock chick: Becky had the audience out of their seats with Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes . 'I love your style,' said will, doing an impression of the singer's bashful onstage presence. 'But I want Danny to push you, its the same thing every week. If you were on my team I would have done something different.' Jessie agreed with will, saying she would have pushed the teen with a different style of song.' The teen was defiant, telling the coaches that he wanted his performance to be a chilled out break in between all of the powerful voices in the competition. Becky had the audience out of their seats with Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes. Support: Becky was concerned that she'd messed up the performance and needed a hug from her coach afterwards . Wearing a provocative outfit of leather shorts, ripped stockings, an army jacket and wild crimped hair, she made her way through the audience and danced with the judges. Becky was concerned that she'd messed up the performance and needed a hug from her coach afterwards. 'She's on fire this girl,' said Tom. 'She takes it to the extreme. So much so that I get a little concerned sometimes that you may hurt your voice. You need to respect it, you only have one voice.' Lost love: David sang She Will Be Loved, revealing that he was singing for a particular girl . War of words: A spat between will and Danny had to be broken up by Jessie . Making fun of Tom's tendency to name-drop, Danny joked: 'I've dueted with a lot of people in my time, Tom, Jessie J, will.i.am... and I'd love to duet with you.' David sang She Will Be loved, revealing that he had a particular unrequited love in mind that he would be singing for. 'You've taken every song I've thrown at you,' said Danny, 'and you've done me proud.' 'It was cool,' said will. When pressed for something more constructive by the other coaches, he said, 'I don't want to be the one going in on them every time.' When pressured, he admitted: 'I don't think you guys are taking it seriously for what stage we are in the competition. You guys are like ""la la la""... the song choice isn't good enough.' Powerful: Toni sang Elton John's Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word . 'You think that's not a good song? You think your team were better?' challenged Danny. A spat broke out between the coaches about whose team were better, with Jessie having to step in, telling Danny and will that they needed to give constructive criticism to the individual artists, and not look critique from the perspective of their teams. Last up, Toni sang Elton John's Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word. 'Double time': will defied critics by tweeting his critiques as he said them on the live show . 'I loved it, you moved me,' said Tom. 'You have so much emotion when you sing, and you use it to your advantage, you don't let it crumble you.' Team Danny topped off the evening with their group performance of Gotye's Somebody That I Used To Know.","Danny and will.i.am's war of words gets heated .

Mr Jerome was arrested after trying to break in to three other properties. Police then found video clips of a house in Marsh in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, which was targeted by a gang of burglars while the owners were on holiday. Property worth tens of thousands of pounds was taken. Judge Potter told Mr Jerome: 'Significantly, in my view, camera footage of the invasion of that property was captured on your mobile phone. 'You, in my judgement, were an important member of the team that attacked that property on those occasions.' The burglar accidentally filmed a break-in after he mistook the video camera on his iPhone for a torch . Another member of the gang, Levi Castledine, of Oakes, is in prison following an earlier hearing. Martin Sharpe, acting for Mr Jerome, said that although his client had previous convictions for burglary when he was a teenager, he had not committed similar offences for more than five years. Mr Sharpe said Mr Jerome was married and that his wife was expecting their first child. Judge Potter said that some of the burgled properties had been occupied at the time of the break-ins and property including cars, mobile phones and jewellery had been stolen. He branded the burglaries ""acts of selfishness"".

"Bungling FBI agents held a terrified mother at gunpoint for 30 minutes after chainsawing their way into her home - before realising they had raided the wrong address. Officers stormed into Judy Sanchez's Fitchburg, Massachusetts, apartment at 6.04am on January 26 after using the blade to cut through her front door. The 29-year-old was then held face down on the floor as her three-year-old daughter Ji-anni cried in another room. But the red-faced agents soon let her go after realising they were supposed to have targeted the home of an alleged drug dealer which was on the same floor of the building. Scroll down for video... Bungled raid: FBI agents held terrified mother Judy Sanchez at gunpoint for 30 minutes after chainsawing their way into her home - before realising they were at the wrong address . Smashed: Judy Sanchez walked into her kitchen to see a chainsaw powering its way through her front door . Sanchez, who now sleeps with a baseball bat by the side of her bed, said she heard heavy footsteps in the stairwell as she walked into her kitchen. She said: 'I just happened to glance over and saw this huge chainsaw ripping down the side of my door. And I was freaking out. I didn't know what was going on.' She said the door was kicked open, adding: 'That's when I heard the clicking of a gun and I heard 'FBI, get down!', so I laid right on down. 'And they said get your dog, so I got her and at the same time I am laying in her urine because she did pee on herself at the same time.' She said the agents told her not to move and so was unable to help her daughter, who was screaming for help in the room next door. Soon enough, though, they realised their mistake and moved in on her neighbour Luis R Vasquez, who uses the street name Joker. Devastated: Judy Sanchez (left) said her young daughter Ji-anni (right) was left alone as she was forced to lie face down on the floor . Wrong place: FBI agents targeted the apartment of a mother, rather than that of an alleged drug dealer . The 41-year-old was later arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base. An FBI spokesman in Boston said the agency would pay for the damage caused to her home. He said the arrest team was only in the wrong apartment for about 15 minutes, and that the special agent in charge at the scene repeatedly apologised for the mistake. But Sanchez said she remained unhappy. She told The Sentinel and Enterprise of Fitchburg: 'Just a little pat on the back and saying 'I'm sorry' is not OK.' 'For me it felt (like a) routine apology, it felt like just a regular, 'I'm sorry for the inconvenience. 'Here's the phone number for your landlord to get reimbursed for the door, have a good day. And that's how I felt, like it was a smack in the face.' The botched raid was part of a two-year probe by federal and state authorities into illegal gun sales, drug trafficking and gang activities they dubbed Operation Red Wolf. The raids resulted in the arrest that day of 16 people in the Fitchburg area for drug offences.","Judy Sanchez held face down on floor after agents stormed her home .

"Apparent atrocities: Unconfirmed footage shows bodies being thrown off a building in Aleppo as the Syrian conflict becomes increasingly violent . Horrifying footage of rebels hurling bodies off a building in Aleppo has raised concerns that the conflict in Syria is becoming increasingly violent. Three unconfirmed videos posted online today show apparent atrocities in Aleppo and include footage of postal workers’ bodies being thrown from a roof and a bound man being repeatedly shot. The amateur footage emerged as rebels Free Syrian Army (FSA) claimed to have shot down a government fighter plane near the Iraqi border. The video was posted on a . social media website and showed four armed rebels and a man described in . the video as a captured pilot in an unidentified location. State media announced that a jet, which crashed in the same area, had experienced ‘technical problems’. Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman said that if the videos were verified, he strongly condemned such atrocities regardless of who was responsible. Mr Rahman told AFP: ‘If these videos are confirmed, such atrocities harm the revolution. 'They only benefit the regime and the enemies of the revolution.’ The new allegations are the latest in the 17-month conflict where both sides have been accused of human rights violations. In one of the videos, the man filming said: ‘These are the heroes of Bab city who are inside the post office.’ As the crowd gathers, people shout ‘this is a shabiha’, which refers to the pro-government militia, as a man’s body is thrown from the roof. The bodies are said to be postal workers but it is unclear when the incident occurred. As fighting in Aleppo continues, rebels say they will turn Syria’s largest city into the 'grave' of the Assad government. Thousands have now fled, with those left running short of food and fuel and afraid for their lives.

State media said the plane was on a ‘routine training mission’ when it experienced ‘technical problems’. The pilot had ejected and the government were searching for him, state media said.

"Nothing brings a smile to the Queen like some quality time with her favourite furry friends. So it's no wonder she was beaming on her recent visit to the Cotts Farm Equine Hospital in Narbeth, Wales. A week into her 89th year, Her Royal Highness looked dazzling in a royal blue outfit with her diamond and pearl brooch and pearl earrings. Neigh-ce to meet you: The Queen with horse Teaforthree and Rebecca Morris  of Cotts Farm Equine Hospital . The Queen left no-one out on her meet and greet at the hospital and even had a chance to wish the horses well from close quarters. One cheeky stallion, Teaforthree, clearly hadn't been prepped on royal protocol and tried to have a nibble of Queen's royal garments -- much to the embarrassment of Cotts Farm's Rebecca Morris. Accompanied by the centre's director Richard Coomer, she also visited the theatres where horses are operated on.

"Thousands of cash-strapped Britons have turned to eBay to save a few pounds - but not many can say that it has helped them to actually make a fortune. Savvy mother of three Alison Abruneiras can though. She became the MD of a successful business grossing more than one million pounds a year after becoming addicted to the auction website. Incredibly, the 46-year-old left school with no qualifications or business experience and only began her business as a hobby to distract her during treatment for cancer. Scroll down for video . Alison Abruneiras founded the Nail and Beauty Emporium at her home in Lincolnshire after becoming addicted to eBay . Alison with her daughter Coralia and husband Amador who both work with her in the business, which now grosses over a million pounds a year . She was making just £70 a week as a nail technician until breast cancer forced her to stop working. But after logging on to eBay in her bedroom at home as a fun ‘hobby’ to take her mind of the treatment, she’s become a hugely successful entrepreneur. In six years, her cosmetic retail business, the Nail and Beauty Emporium, has grown to become a big hit on eBay. It now trades worldwide and Alison has had to expand into a warehouse and take on four staff - including her 22-year-old daughter, Coralia, who is set to take over the business. From logging on to eBay in her bedroom at home as a fun 'hobby' to take her mind of the treatment, she's become a hugely successful entrepreneur . In six years, her cosmetic retail business has grown to become a big hit on eBay and now trades worldwide . Alison, from Lincoln, said: ‘Looking back, It’s incredible to think that this all started at my computer in my bedroom. ‘It has been really hard work but I’d like to show other people that it can be done - if I can do it, anyone can. ‘Anyone can earn money. You don’t have to have an education, I don’t have a GCSE to my name.’ Selling is in the genes though and Alison has had an interest in business since childhood. At 11 years old she was given a little market stall by her shopkeeper dad to sell washing up liquid and other small items. But she never pursued her talent. At the age of 21 she moved to Lanzarote, Spain, after falling in love with her now husband Amador, 47, and worked as a holiday rep and nail technician. The couple had children Coralia, Amador, 21, and Luis, 15 before moving back to the UK in 2005 where Alison continued to work as a nail technician. Three years ago Alison went from sole trader to a limited company and, today, business continues to boom - expanding to websites Amazon and Play.com . Alison with children Luis, Coralia and Wrigley in Spain (left)before her cancer, and now in her company warehouse (right) But at the age of 38 she was forced to give it up after being diagnosed with breast cancer.For the next two years she underwent agonising treatment - including a lumpectomy and mastectomy. Her ovaries and lymph nodes were removed before she began a course of chemotherapy. ‘It was a huge shock to me,’ Alison said. ‘When you’re diagnosed with something like that it knocks you off your feet. ‘I lost a lot of my confidence and became incredibly depressed.’ With spare time on her hands, Alison turned her attention to eBay. She said: ‘I didn’t want my whole world and life to be about cancer and chemo and that’s how I discovered eBay - I wanted a hobby. Alison, here with Coralia, has now set her sights on the hospitality industry and has opened a Spanish Tapas restaurant next door to the family home . ‘I needed something to take me away from that hell, something to focus on - eBay, at the time, was my focus and it was exciting.’ She added: ‘I started by buying a foot spa from an end-of-line shop and seeing if I could sell it for a profit. ‘I bought it for £10 and within a week I’d sold it for £30. ‘I would be checking the internet every half an hour. Making that sale gave me that buzz and made me feel good. I didn’t think about whether I was going to die or whether the treatment was going to work. ‘Everything was a real whirlwind but building my business gave me a way of fighting cancer. ‘Then, when I’d finished the treatment, I was left with an empty void and I was wondering what I was going to do next. At her three-bedroom rented home, you won't find designer clothes and flashy cars. In fact, the only luxuries Alison enjoys are family holidays . ‘That’s when my business really took off, I put everything in to it after that.’ Boosted by her new-found sales talent, Alison used her expertise as a nail technician to expand into other cosmetic products. She explained: ‘I bought £3000 worth of products from a wholesaler and stored them in my bedroom - which had become my office. Within two weeks I’d nearly sold all of that too. ‘From there it became an addiction - I’d be on the computer first thing in the morning and up until midnight.’ The business proved a real lifeline when husband Amador lost his job as a restaurant manager in 2010.Alison said: ‘My hobby suddenly became the only income and I knew we were going to have to make it a success to survive. ‘Amador started working with me and we worked together for two years. He put some really good things in place and we made it work.’ Alison (C) with daughter Coralia (L), husband Amador (L), and staff at OleOle, her tapas restaurant . Three years ago Alison went from sole trader to a limited company and, today, business continues to boom - expanding to websites Amazon and Play.com . But, despite all her success, she remains incredibly grounded and lives a modest lifestyle. At her three-bedroom rented home, you won’t find designer clothes and flashy cars. In fact, the only luxuries Alison enjoys are family holidays to Florida and Egypt and a brand new camper van. She’s also treated Coralia to a new Mini as a reward for working so hard. She said: ‘My daughter has taken a leaf out of my book - like me, she didn’t do very well at school and left with no qualifications. ‘But she’s proving a real whizz when it comes to business - everything she knows is self-taught. She’s amazing on social media and all the suppliers love her.’ Alison has now even set her sights on the hospitality industry and has opened a Spanish Tapas restaurant, called Ole Ole, next door to the family home. Under the management of Amador, it’s also become a huge success in just five months - already rated fifth best of 335 restaurants in Lincoln on website TripAdvisor. Alison added: ‘We have worked like crazy and life has completely changed but it’s changed for the better.’","Alison used to work as a nail technician for £70 a week .

"Hungary is planning to offer citizenship to any foreigner who buys at least £200,000 of its government’s bonds. Legislation would grant residency and ultimately a Hungarian passport... allowing the holder to live and work anywhere in the European Union. The move, backed by the ruling party, is aimed at wealthy investors, especially from China. Radical proposals: The Hungarian Parliament in Budapest, where legislators are considering issuing bonds to foreign investors in exchange for citizenship . Hungary has billions of pounds of foreign currency debt maturing in the next few years and needs to find ways to refinance it. Budapest has asked for help from the EU and the International Monetary . Fund but talks are dragging on and analysts see only a 50 per cent . chance of a deal. The citizenship scheme calls for the debt management office to issue special ‘residency bonds’ to foreigners. Holders of at least a quarter of a million euros of Hungarian debt would get preferential immigration treatment. Legislation would grant residency and ultimately a Hungarian passport... allowing the holder to live and work anywhere in the European Union (flag pictured) 'The goal of the modification is to . create the institution of ‘investor residency’ in Hungary,' the . lawmakers who put forth the legislation wrote in their proposal. ‘The proposal ties gaining citizenship to buying bonds because it . intends to aid state financing this way. ‘Other investments from those applying for such residency could boost the real estate, retail and investment markets.’ Mihaly Babak, a lawmaker with the ruling party, said: ‘The Chinese have . articulated repeatedly that we should help their Hungarian investments.’ Public debt in Hungary is equivalent to about 80 per cent of its annual economic output and households also are struggling with a mountain of foreign-currency debt. One of the authors of the proposal said Chinese investors were specifically targeted. Tory MP Priti Patel said: 'This is a shocking abuse of EU membership by the Hungarian Government and highlights one of many flaws in the EU and in the way it operates. 'This policy could pose significant challenges for the EU when it comes to immigration, social and economic policies and will do little to restore any trust and confidence in the EU with the British public.' Tory MP Ian Liddell Grainger said: 'At the end of the day this is not the way to encourage investment. It never has been and it never should be. All you do is undermine your institutions. 'It is up to them what they do. But dare I say it it is not a very clever way of doing it.'","Any foreigner who buys at least £200,000 of its government's bonds may receive Hungarian passport ."
"Sir Mortimer Wheeler saved Roman ruins in Libya during the Second World War by driving across the country in a Jeep and stationing men around them . A British archeologist and TV personality has emerged as the saviour of Roman ruins during the Second World War after protecting them from Allied soldiers. However, new research into his archives has also revealed he was a bully, a 'sex pest' and a 'groper' in his private life, and was unfaithful to his wife. Sir Mortimer Wheeler, the father of modern archeology and veteran of both world wars, joined Field Marshal Montgomery's victorious campaign again Rommel in North Africa in 1942, fighting in the decisive battle of El Alamein. After the Allied victory, however, the brigadier was horrified to see Australian troops vandalising Roman ruins by tipping over stone columns, so he went on a one-man mission to save them. Taking a 48-hour leave of absence, he drove in a Jeep across Libya stationing military police around sites such as Sabratha and Leptis Magna, according to Gabriel Moshenska, lecturer in archaeology at University College London. His actions undoubtedly saved the historical sites from further harm, making Sir Mortimer a precursor to the Monuments Men, made famous by the George Clooney film, who were tasked with saving art from the Nazis towards the end of the war. As Allied forced prepared to invade Sicily in July 1943, Sir Mortimer even wrote a leaflet given out to troops which explained the importance of leaving the Roman ruins unharmed. According to The Times, he wrote: 'Remember the meaning which the Vandals, a Germanic tribe, gave to their name by their actions in this regard. History has a long memory.' Leptis Magna (pictured) was one of the sites Sir Mortimer stationed troops at. He sprung into action after watching Australian troops vandalising ruins after the Allied victory at El Alamein . Leptis Magna has been a settlement since roughly 100BC, but only fell under Roman control in 146BC . Sir Mortimer's actions make him a precursor to the Monuments Men, a team of art experts put together at the end of the war to save art from the Nazis, and made famous by the George Clooney film (pictured) Sir Mortimer also fought in the First World War, and towards the end of the conflict lead his men and 12 horses into no-man's land to capture two German guns near the Somme. After that conflict ended he travelled back to England where he took up a position at the National Museum of Wales, then at the London Museum, before founding the Archaeological Institute in London in 1934 with his wife, Tessa. However, Sir Mortimer struggled to live up to his military achievements in his private life, which is riddled with scandal. When money was tight Sir Mortimer resorted to selling 'slightly forged' ancient slingshots taken from Chesil Beach to raise much-needed cash, along with several other 'scams', according to archives of his work. Before the Allies invaded Sicily, Sir Mortimer drew up a leaflet that was given to every man warning against damaging the ruins there (pictured, a mosaic near Piazza Armenia, Sicily) Sir Mortimer also fought in the First World War, but struggled to live up to his exploits in civilian life where he was unfaithful to his wife, and became known as a bully and a 'sex pest' He later became a TV personality and in the 50s and 60s appeared on shows such as Animal, Vegetalbe, Mineral?, though he was accused of preparing in advance. His wife was also tormented by his infidelity, with Sir Mortimer even being described as a 'sex pest'. 'He was, by all accounts, a bit of a groper and a sex pest and an incredible bully as well — and yet many of his members of staff were incredibly devoted to him,' Dr Moshenska said. Sir Mortimer Wheeler will feature in Voices of War: UCL in World War I, an exhibition opening next month at the college's Institute of Archaeology, Bloomsbury, central London.","Sir Mortimer Wheeler served in both the First and Second World Wars .

"The bravery medals won by a Spitfire ace who shot down three enemy aircraft on the same day have sold for £144,000. Air Commodore Ronald ‘Ras’ Berry was one of the RAF’s greatest pilots, racking up more than 30 ‘claims’ on enemy aircraft, including 14 confirmed kills, during the Second World War. On August 31, 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, he downed a German Messerschmitt 109 plane either side of breakfast and then a third before dinner. A portrait of Air Commodore Berry, left, and a photograph of the flying ace who downed up to 34 enemies, right . His medals, pictured here, sold, along with maps and log books for a staggering £144,000 . The officer, who sported a handlebar moustache, admitted that seeing German bombers destroy British cities motivated him to exact revenge. Air Cdre Berry was held in such high regard that he was one of few airmen chosen to lead Winston Churchill’s coffin at his funeral 20 years after the end of the war . He was awarded the CBE for his services along with the Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross with Bar - the Bar means he had received two of the same medal. The medals, along with his log books and several aviation maps, have now been auctioned for the six figure sun at the Spink & Son auction house in London. Oliver Pepys, a medals expert at Spink, said: 'Ronald Berry was one of The Few [a phrase coined by Winston Churchill to describe pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain] who distinguished themselves in World War II. 'He did have such an amazing tally of kills and probable kills. 'His medals are very significant, in the fact you have a DSO and a DFC with Bar - three superb gallantry awards for World War II. 'The DFC is for the Battle of Britain. He was very much one of The Few who stopped Operation Sea Lion - Hitler’s plan to invade Britain - from happening. 'Prices for gallantry medals are very strong at the moment.' Air Cdre Berry, who died in 2000 aged 84, was born in Hull and joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1937. Air Commodore Berry, right, was held in such regard he carried Winston Churchill's coffin at the PM's funeral . A poster which affectionately mocks the star pilot over his achievements, left, his exploits made him a celebrity . Two months after the outbreak of the war he was sent to Montrose in Scotland to help protect the airfield there and served in 603 Squadron. Days later he was involved in one of the earliest interceptions of the war when he damaged a Heinkel III bomber. The pilot climbing into his Spitfire, he once shot down three planes in one day . He went on to shoot down a Junkers 88 bomber into the North Sea and had three shared kills during his time in Scotland. Due to increasing RAF casualties, 603 Squadron was sent to south east England on August 1940 during the height of the Battle of Britain. In September 1940 Air Cdre Berry was involved in up to four dog-fights a day and accounted for 14 different enemy aircraft in that time, earning him his first DFC. After the Battle of Britain he was one of only eight survivors out of the 24 original pilots from 603 Squadron. He was promoted from Sergeant Pilot to Squadron Leader and took part in a convoy patrols as well as providing air cover for the disastrous Dieppe Raid in 1942. His 81 Squadron was the first to land in French North Africa in November 1942 where he had a farcical exchange with a French commander, with each claiming superiority over the other - eventually someone intervened and explained to the Frenchman that the Brits had the edge. By the end of the Tunisian campaign in May 1943, he had downed 14 enemy aircraft destroyed, have shared kills on another ten, along with nine probables, 17 damaged and seven destroyed on the ground. After the war he was in charge of the Air Fighting Development Unit at West Raynham in Norfolk, made OBE in 1946 and CBE in 1965.

"Last season's best two under-21 sides shared the points in a pulsating match in west London, with both sides pushing hard for the win before settling for a draw. Manchester United fielded Tyler Blackett and Tom Thorpe, both of whom have seen first team football under Louis van Gaal, together at centre back as both looked to put their case that they can be trusted to fill the crisis position at Old Trafford. But they were both upstaged by another central defender, as Andreas Christensen's header earned Chelsea a share of the spoils.

But moments after the break it was United who took the lead. Ola Aina was adjudged to have handled Saidy Janko's cross deliberately, and Will Keane stepped up to slot home.

United celebrate taking the lead early in the second half, and could have doubled their lead soon after . United almost doubled their lead soon after, Tyler Blackett, who was on the bench for Van Gaal's side against Crystal Palace on Saturday, charging forward from the back but unable to convert a good chance. And the visitors were punished for their wastefulness soon after, when Christensen headed from Baker's corner, having been left totally unmarked. Both sides pushed for the win, but in the end a draw was the right result.

"Two 'perfect faces' - created from the features of glamorous actresses, singers and models - reveal the stark differences between how men and women perceive female beauty. In a beauty survey, men and women were asked to build up a perfect face from the features of some of the most beautiful women in the world. The research revealed that men prefer blonde hair, full lips, and strong cheekbones but also a petite nose, less prominent forehead and finer eyebrows. Women see the epitome of beauty as raven hair, a stronger nose and forehead profile, strong brows and narrower bone structure. The . most popular features for men were Shakira's cascading blonde hair, . Miranda Kerr's button nose, the forehead of Jennifer Aniston, the .

'Interestingly, the faces are made up of a mix of different ages - 38-year-old Angelina Jolie was men's preferred choice for cheekbones and pout while 21-year-old Cara Delevingne was the women's top choice for eyebrows. 'Meanwhile, Shakira, 36, had the men's preferred hairstyle and a 44-year-old Jennifer Aniston's was their preferred forehead shape.

"Admission: Former Flamengo goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes de Souza told a court that his girlfriend had been killed, chopped up and fed to dogs . A star Brazilian footballer broke down as he admitted that his former girlfriend was murdered, dismembered and fed to dogs. Bruno Fernandes de Souza, 28, a goalkeeper who was tipped to play for Brazil at the 2014 World Cup, is accused of having Eliza Samudio killed to avoid paying child support after she gave birth to his love child. The former Flamengo player had previously denied any knowledge of what happened to the 25-year-old, but told a Brazilian court yesterday how his best friend Luiz Henrique Romao had paid someone to kill her. He admitted that although he hadn't ordered his former lover to be killed, he had 'accepted' it. The goalkeeper is accused of planning Ms Samudio's abduction and murder with eight others including his wife Dayane, another former lover, a cousin and former policeman Marcos Santos. It has been alleged that he watched as Santos tortured her and then helped him to chop her body. Parts of the woman's corpse are alleged to have been fed to Bruno's pet rottweillers, while the rest was buried in concrete. At an earlier trial, Romao was found guilty of Ms Samudio's murder and jailed for 15 years. Santos will be put on trial next month. Bruno, who before his arrest had been linked with a multi-million pound transfer to AC Milan, has always claimed Ms Samudio was alive and had left the country. Her body has never been found. But he told a court in Contagem, southeast Brazil, that his cousin, Jorge Rosa, who had witnessed the murder, had told him what had happened. He claimed that after kidnapping Ms Samudio, Romao had taken her to a house in Belo Horizonte where hired killer Santos was waiting. He said: 'There he held her hands and asked [Romao] to tie them in front of her, and put a tie around her neck. Model: Eliza Samudio is believed to have met Bruno at a party held by another footballer. She later presented a report (left) to police against the footballer, claiming he had got her pregnant . 'And [Romao] even kicked Eliza's legs away. That's what Jorge told me. And that they had chopped up her body, that they had thrown her body for the dogs to eat.' The former star admitted that he feels 'guilty' for her death despite instisting that he never oredered the killing. Ms Samudio, who had previously claimed to have had an affair with Real Madrid ace Cristiano Ronaldo, met Bruno at a footballers' party in May 2009 and fell pregnant by accident, it is claimed. The goalkeeper demanded she have an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy, instead insisting that he assume paternity of the child. Broke down: Souza, 28, is seen in the Forum of Contagem, metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, southeastern Brazil, this week . Before her disappearance on June 4, 2010, Ms Samudio had approached police claiming she had been held captive by Bruno and his associates, who forced her to take an illegal abortion drug. Bruno allegedly put a gun to her head and told her: 'You don't know who I am or what I'm capable of - I'm from the favela.' The baby, Bruninho, was born in February 2010, but the player refused to acknowledge he was the father. Prosecutors allege that Bruno ordered Ms Samudio's murder after she told him she would take legal action to force him to pay child support. In a statement to police, the footballer's teenage cousin Jorge Rosa claimed he and Romao picked up Ms Samudio and her son from a Rio de Janeiro hotel after she accepted an invitation by the footballer to talk about the paternity claims. He said they drove her 220 miles to a property in Belo Horizonte which Bruno and his wife used as a weekend retreat, where she was held captive for six days. Ms Samudio was then allegedly handed over to former military policeman Santos, who committed 'barbaric tortures' on her before strangling her to death with a neck tie in front of her four-month-old son. Santos, who was allegedly paid £8,000 to murder her, played loud music on a stereo to drown out the woman's screams, it is claimed. Edson Moreira, a detective who investigated the case, said: 'His acts were almost impossible to describe without breaking down - images from the worst nightmare you could imagine.' Police later found Ms Samudio's four-month-old baby in a Belo Horizonte slum, alleged to have been abandoned there by Bruno's wife Dayane. DNA tests later proved the footballer's paternity. The child is now being looked after by Ms Samudio's mother. Bruno's trial, which began on Monday, is expected to conclude today. If found guilty he could be jailed for up to 41 years.

Claims: Prosecutors will allege that Bruno organised the abduction and murder of Ms Samudio with eight others . In . a recent interview with Brazil's Fantastico TV programme, Bruno's . lawyer Rui Pimenta said he was confident his client would be found . innocent of any crime and even claimed the goalkeeper believed he would . be the star player in Brazil's 2014 World Cup. He said: 'One, because there was no murder. And second, if there was, even without any proof, Bruno wasn't responsible, he never wanted it, never desired it, the thought never even passed his mind. 'He'll be in the World Cup final, in Maracana, against Argentina. It will end 0-0. Who will take the penality? The world's greatest player, Messi. And who will save it and lift the trophy for 200 million Brazilians? Bruno. This is his biggest dream.' But Jose Arteiro Cavalcante, for the prosecution, responded: 'You can be sure Bruno won't be starring in the World Cup. Only if it's the World Cup in the year 3000. 'Bruno committed this cowardly crime, thinking that he was God. There might not be a body but there are many other indisputable proofs.' Bruno is one of five accused in the case who go on trial this week. If found guilty he could be jailed for up to 41 years.

"The biological mother of star quarterback Colin Kaepernick has expressed her longing for a relationship with the son she gave up for adoption 25 years ago. Heidi Russo, 44, a nurse in Denver, made the heart-wrenching decision to place her baby in the care of the Kaepernick family back in 1987. Colin now plays for the San Francisco 49ers and is fast becoming one to watch on the field. After getting his first NFL start against the Chicago Bears during Monday Night Football last month, Kaepernick scored two touchdowns, massacring the Bears' tough defense and drawing high praise from the 49ers head coach. Family: Heidi Russo (left) says she longs for a closer relationship with her biological son Colin Kaepernick (right), the 49ers star quarterback, whom she gave up for adoption when she was 18 years old . Ms Russo has been following her son's growing celebrity status from the stands at football matches but longs for a deeper relationship with him and often comments on his Twitter profile. She regularly congratulates him on his success on the football field and even bizarrely on his diminishing body fat. Kaepernick tweeted last year: 'Body fat just taken and I'm at 7%... Let's see where I end at'. Ms Russo quickly responded: 'Wow!!! Probably 4 or 5%? Keep workin' hard Colin!' Although she has had contact with Colin in the past, her son seems reluctant to build a relationship. Colin . was born on November 3, 1987 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Ms Russo. He . was adopted at six weeks' old by Rick and Teresa Kaepernick from Fond Du Lac and has two siblings. Star: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has made two starts this NFL season and is highly rated by football pundits . Cheering from the sidelines: Heidi Russo regularly comments on her biological son's Twitter feed as he updates football fans on his career . As he grew up, the Kaepernicks sent Ms Russo pictures of Colin until contact fell away when he was around seven years old. Ms Russo's desire for a relationship has not so far been reciprocated by Colin. When she initially emailed him as an adult, the footballer sent a few messages asking about his father with whom Ms Russo has had no contact since her son's birth. She met with the Kaepernick family three months ago when the Niners played the Denver Broncos but has had little interaction since. Ms Russo, who now has an eight-year-old son, told Mercury News: 'If and when he changes his mind - he may never change his mind - I'll watch him from home. When I have a chance to get out to a game, I'll watch him from there.' She has respected his wishes, adding: 'I made my call on Colin a long time ago. I have to live with that.' Kaepernick, who played college . football with the Nevada Wolf Pack, was dragged into a racial . controversy last week after a white sports columnist compared the . tattooed player to residents of San Quentin state prison. It is the extensive body art of Colin Kaepernick - the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers that has so upset sports columnist David Whitely . Sporting . News writer David Whitley penned an article where he bemoaned the . amount of tattoos that 25-year-old Kaepernick had on his body. Claiming that the position of . quarterback is hallowed and Kaepernick's body art brings it down in . tone, Whitley said that because of his tattoos, the 49ers player can . never be a legitimate hero. But he later defended himself against accusations of racism, saying: 'If they were old enough to read, my two adopted African-American . daughters would certainly be disappointed to find out I'm a racist.' “It didn’t occur to me that admitting I’m not a fan of body art would be admitting I don’t like African-Americans.' The furious response overwhelmed Whitley, who had to fend off accusations of racial profiling, prompting his editor-in-chief to take the unusual step of writing a defence of the opinion piece in which he admitted Whitley could have finessed certain points. Whitley, who is the father of two adopted African-American daughters, was even criticised by Kaepernick's parents - who revealed that his tattoos are in fact verses from the Bible. Proud parents: Colin Kaepernick with his adoptive parents Rick and Teresa following a college football game for the Nevada Wolf Pack . 'It annoyed me,' said his mother Teresa Kaepernick.'You are categorizing this kid on something like tattoos? Really?  'Saying other guys are role models because they don't have them? Really? Some of these other guys don't have . crystal clear reputations. That's how you're going to define this kid? It's pretty irritating is what it is.' Colin's father Rick said that Whitley should have focused on . his son's charity work and not his body art. 'This . guy has probably never talked to Colin,' Rick said. 'Instead of saying . that Colin does all these great things and donates his time to children, . this guy is going to make him out like a gangster. 'Really? I guess you . just have to roll with the punches.' He added: 'Somebody . asked me if I got mad about that. I said no. It's just a guy and his . opinion. I could have an opinion about him, but I've never met the guy, . so I don't know if my opinion would be right.'

"Admission: Clive Goodman (pictured today) said he had hacked the royals while working at the tabloid . Disgraced former royal reporter Clive . Goodman hacked Kate Middleton’s phones 155 times in eight months, he . admitted for the first time yesterday. The former News of the World royal . editor hacked Miss Middleton – now the Duchess of Cambridge – on an . almost daily basis, including on Christmas Day. He also frequently intercepted the voicemails of Princes William and Harry. Goodman, who was jailed for hacking . mobiles belonging to royal aides in 2007, said he had not previously . told police or prosecutors about the true extent of his hacking because . he was never asked about it. The 56-year-old told the phone hacking . trial he targeted the young royals in 2005 and 2006 and continued to . hack Miss Middleton until the day before his arrest in August 2006. He hacked Prince William 35 times and . Prince Harry nine times and also targeted royal aides, including the . Duchess of York’s press aide Kate Waddington and Prince Charles’s former . valet Michael Fawcett. He insisted he would have told police about the full extent of the hacking operation if he had been asked. Goodman, a married father of one, was . jailed for four months in 2007 after he admitted his part in hacking . William and Harry’s PA Helen Asprey, their private secretary Jamie . Lowther- Pinkerton and their Press aide Paddy Harverson. Private detective Glenn Mulcaire was jailed for six months. Goodman said the editor of the News of . the World at the time, Andy Coulson, knew about the hacking and . sanctioned £500-a-week payments to Mulcaire to target the royals. Timothy Langdale QC, for Coulson, . confronted Goodman with phone data which showed he had personally hacked . William, Kate and Harry. Goodman said: ‘I am not on trial for . phone hacking. I completely agree I hacked these people’s phones. Allegations: Kate Middleton and Prince William on the day of their graduation at St Andrew's University in June 2005. The Duchess was said in court to have been first hacked in December that year by Goodman . 'I have . never been asked by any inquiry or investigation about this. 'Now you’re asking me about them, I’m quite happy to answer and get everything out in the open.’ The jury has previously heard that the . Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into phone hacking at the . News of the World after the Royal Household raised the alarm. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC, told the . jurors the 2006 investigation was more limited than the later police . inquiry, Operation Weeting, launched in 2011. Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, said . he first targeted Miss Middleton amid speculation her relationship with . Prince William was becoming more serious, and that Mulcaire had provided . her phone details. He told the Old Bailey: ‘I’m really . not the slightest bit proud of this. Trial: Goodman returned to the hacking trial of former editors Rebekah Brooks (left), Andy Coulson (right) and five others to finish giving his evidence after he fell ill on March 21. All seven defendants deny the charges . 'I don’t want anyone to think I’m . not ashamed of what we did but the fact of the matter was we did it and . I’m trying to tell the truth about it.’ The journalist said Mulcaire’s role at . the News of the World was well known at the paper, adding: ‘Virtually . every story that went through the paper was ground through Glenn .

"NBC's Bob Costas said Tuesday that his anti-gun rant, which he delivered during Sunday night football programming, was largely misunderstood. Costas told sports radio host Dan Patrick that 90 seconds wasn't enough time for him to 'flesh out' what he meant to say when he criticized U.S. gun laws as too lenient, and suggested that those laws are to blame for the murder-suicide of the NFL's Jovan Belcher. 'What I was trying to say was, that if you want some perspective on this, there are a number of issues related to [Belcher's murder-suicide] that we could begin to talk about and think about,' Costas said. 'The problem was that I didn't have enough time to get to many of them. And that, I think, was my mistake to be quite honest.' Scroll down for video . Unexpected: Bob Costas, who has been on the air for NBC Sports television since the early 1980s, angered viewers after advocating for gun control during a Sunday night football game . Costas went on to say that he meant to bring attention to domestic violence issues as well as gun rights issues. 'I'm thinking I can't address all of . the possible aspects of this,' he said. 'Domestic violence - the . possibility of athletes, especially athletes who play a violent sport . are more prone to domestic violence than people the same age elsewhere . in society. 'The possible connection between football and this particular . tragedy. We know that football is connected, and it's effects are . connected to other situations. We don't know yet whether it's connected . to Belcher, but that's certainly a question that could be asked. The . easy availability of guns is another.' Costas said he made the mistake of . breaking one of his cardinal broadcasting rules, which is to avoid delving into . touchy subjects unless there is enough time to flesh them out. 'I had maybe 50 seconds total for . this -- my implication was a bit of perspective, here's one aspect of . it,' he said. 'So I think that my mistake there was that I left it open . to too much interpretation.' In his initial remarks about guns . that sparked outrage among supporters of gun rights, the 60-year-old . Queens, New York, native paraphrased and quoted from a piece by Fox . Sports columnist Jason Whitlock, formerly of the Kansas City Star. Murder-suicide: Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher, 25, shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself on Saturday morning . Costas praised the emotive column . and told his viewers, ‘In the coming days, Jovan Belcher's actions and . their possible connection to football will be analyzed. Who knows? But . here, wrote Jason Whitlock, is what I believe. ‘If Jovan Belcher didn't possess a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today.’ On Saturday, December 1, Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend Perkins, 22, the mother of his 3-month-old daughter. Belcher . then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, his team’s home stadium in Kansas . City, Missouri, and shot himself in the parking lot of its practice . facility. Family and friends said the two had endured a 'strained relationship' that had intensified after the birth of their daughter. The online reaction to Costas' remarks came fast, with many viewers criticizing the sportscaster for voicing his personal and political opinions on a program meant for entertainment. ‘The Media Left at Halftime: Bob Costas pushing gun control, quoting...who else?..a sports writer on ridding the country of the 2nd Amendment,’ wrote television host Lou Dobbs, who uses the Twitter handle @loudobbsnews . ‘Bob Costas, who’s gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men’s bodies and brains, gives us a little civics lecture,’ wrote Fox commentator Andrew Levy, who uses the Twitter handle @andylevy . ‘Yes, Bob Costas, guns are the problem. Nicole Brown Simpson would be alive today if OJ hadn't shot her with that knife,’ wrote Twitter user @ToddKincannon . ‘NRA gonna' be PISSSED at Bob Costas,’ wrote Twitter user @JeremyStahl . Judging from about 100 tweets, more than 95 per cent of those quickest to respond to Costas' remarks expressed annoyance and outright disagreement, with only a few in favor. National Post sports columnist Bruce Arthur, who uses the Twitter handle @bruce_arthur, was one of the few on the micro-blogging site to agree with the remarks. ‘Bob Costas just quoted Jason Whitlock, and the whole thing made perfect sense,’ he wrote.

"The Royal Family faces condemnation after the Duchess of Cambridge and Princes William and Harry broke a worldwide celebrity boycott of hotels owned by the controversial Sultan of Brunei. On Friday, the 32-year-old Duchess used a blacked-out car to conceal her visit to the Dorchester Hotel in London's Mayfair for the wedding of her cousin, Adam Middleton. The following day, her husband, Prince William, and brother-in-law, Prince Harry, also broke the boycott by playing polo at Coworth Park, a country house hotel in Ascot. Both venues are part of the Dorchester Collection group owned by the Sultan, whose decision to impose sharia law in his country, which would make it legal for homosexuals living there to be stoned,  has provoked an outcry. Scroll down for video . Controversy: The Duchess of Cambridge (left) has risked dragging the Royal Family into fresh embarrassment after secretly attending a wedding at a hotel owned by the Sultan of Brunei (right) Scene: The Dorchester Collection hotel group is owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the country's finance ministry. Kate Middleton's cousin married at the venue on Friday . Breaking the boycott: Prince William  and Prince Harry play polo at Coworth Park Polo Club on Saturday . On Friday, the Duchess used a blacked-out people carrier to slip in and out of the underground car park at the Dorchester Hotel for the family wedding. Speaking to the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare, who broke the news of the Duchess' secret visit, an insider said: 'The wedding was a big boost for the hotel... It shows that the royals will not let the Brunei business keep them away.' The civil marriage ceremony the Duchess attended was that of her first cousin, Adam Middleton, to the interior designer, Rebecca Poynton. Also in attendance were Kate's parents, Carole and Michael, her brother, James, and her sister Pippa. Michael Middleton's brother Richard is the groom's father. On Saturday, Princes William and Harry also endorsed the Sultan's luxury hotel chain when they were photographed playing polo at a star-studded event at Coworth Park in Berkshire. They took part in a charity match at the annual Audi Polo Challenge, held to raise money for the Royal Marsden Hospital, the youth training charity, Skillforce, and the HIV fund, Sentebale. After taking part in the polo game, which they lost, the princes lined up for official photographs, and had their pictures taken with celebrities including Dame Helen Mirren. The young royals' visits to the Sultan's venues - the Duchess of Cambridge was accompanied by nine police protection officers - risk dragging the Royal Family into the growing row over the harsh new laws the Sultan has introduced. Popular with the royals: The Duchess is not the only royal to endorse the Sultan of Brunei's luxury hotels recently. Princes Harry (far left) and William (second from right) both played polo at Coworth Park on Saturday . The Sultan of Brunei's hotels have been the focus of a worldwide boycott backed by the likes of Anna Wintour (right) and Sir Richard Branson (left). They are unhappy at the severe laws recently introduced in Brunei . Celebrities including Stephen Fry, Anna Wintour and . Sir Richard Branson have all voiced their opposition to harsh . new Islamic laws in Brunei. The . stoning to death of homosexuals is just one of a number of brutal . punishments Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has brought in following his . decision to introduce Islamic Sharia law to the small Southeast Asian . nation.Others include amputation for crimes such as theft and the death . penalty for adulterers. Around . a third of Brunei's population are non-Muslim and there is concern that . the new laws could also allow for the punishments to be applied to . these citizens in certain circumstances. The introduction of Sharia law has alarmed human rights groups around the world. The Sultan has condemned the criticism however, saying: 'People outside of Brunei should respect us in the same way that we respect them.' The refusal to back down on the introduction of the harsh punishments, which formally came into law last month, has seen a number of celebrities make public protests against the many businesses the Sultan of Brunei owns or is connected to outside his oil-rich country. The first protests were held at the famous Beverly Hills hotel, a . favored haunt for Hollywood A-listers. Throughout April and early May, at least 20 events were canceled at the historic hotel, with stars including Jay Leno and Ellen Degeneres taking part in protests outside the pink stucco building. Worldwide: Supporters of women's rights and LGBT groups wear masks of Jay Leno and Ellen DeGeneres during a protest outside the Hotel Bel-Air, to urge people to boycott businesses owned by the Sultan of Brunei . With the . boycott spreading throughout the world, Vogue's editor in chief Anna . Wintour last week joined the stampede of stars refusing to visit the . Sultan's hotels. She . has confirmed that she will no longer be staying at Le Meurice - the . hotel favoured by the fashion elite and her usual base during Paris . Fashion Week. Ms . Wintour released a statement to the New York Times explaining: 'While I . am sensitive to the potential impact that this issue may have on the . wonderful staff at Le Meurice, I cannot in all good conscience stay . there, nor can Vogue’s editors.' Her . decision comes as Conde Nast confirmed that all its magazines have . opted to boycott the Dorchester Collection of hotels, which includes The . Dorchester and 45 Park Lane, in London, as well as Coworth Park. Stephen Fry was among the first British stars to announce he was joining the campaign, tweeting that he had cancelled his stay at Coworth Park. Sir Richard Branson and Sharon Osbourne have since added their voices to the hotel boycott. Shoe designer Brian Atwood and designer Peter Som have also called for action, as has François-Henri Pinault - the head of Kering, which owns Gucci, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. The Dorchester Collection hotel group is . owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the country's finance . ministry.

"This shocking picture shows how a young woman's face was savagely ripped apart by a female gang member as part of an 'initiation ceremony'. The victim, named only as Leanne, 22, was set upon as she walked alone through a park in Southend, Essex. She was dragged to the floor by her hair before the crazed attacker repeatedly scratched her fingernails down her face. Attack: Leanne, 22, is left with a bloodied face after being clawed by a suspected gang member in an unprovoked park attack in Southend, Essex . Three men kicked her in the legs and body as she lay in a bloody mess before fleeing with her black Nike bag. Police fear the attacker targeted Leanne as part of an initiation process for a gang responsible for a recent spate of street robberies in Southend, Leigh and Westcliff, Essex. She has released this bloodied picture of herself to help police catch the woman and the gang of four men she was with. The incident happened as she was walking through Southchurch Park, near Woodgrange Drive, Southend. Attacker: This is an efit of the woman yob police are hunting over the lunchtime park attack on Leanne, 22 . Leanne, who lives in Southend, was so traumatised that when she called 999 she was unable to even give them her surname. A passer-by comforted her until police and paramedics arrived, and took her to Southend Hospital for treatment. She could now be left with permanent scarring. Police have also released an e-fit of the woman attacker. Southend Inspector Matt Bennett said: 'There seems to be a completely unnecessary level of violence that's quite horrific. 'There's no reason why this level of violence has been used, it was totally unprovoked. 'There . are theories as to why this happened - maybe somebody tried to prove . themselves to the gang, but that's only a theory at the moment. 'Whatever the motivation, it's thoroughly unjustified and disgraceful behaviour.' Leanne was robbed of her bag containing £62 cash, a gold chain, store cards and documents. The . woman who led the attack was thought to be in her early 20s, about 5ft . 1in tall, either tanned or of mixed race with dark-coloured hair in a . pony tail. She wore a grey tracksuit, and would have had blood all over her trousers. Three of the men with her were black, and the victim described them as aged about 25. One was wearing a red hooded top and the others had black hoodies. One of them had a red bandana over his face. A fourth man helped drag the woman to the ground. He was white, in his 20s, skinny and wearing a black jumper.","Leanne, 22, may be left with permanent scarring after the unprovoked attack in Southend, Essex .

"A career criminal who was the youngest person in Britain to be handed an ASBO when he was 14 will not have to repay £26,000 in drug money following a new arrest after claiming it was stolen. Declan Madigan, now 27, was labelled a 'one-boy crime wave' in 2000 after being arrested 100 times for violent crime, burglary and car theft when he was just a teenager. He was jailed this year for 11 years after being convicted of a drive-by shooting and drug offences in Nottingham despite having been paralysed from the waist-down in an earlier car crash. Declan Madigan, now 27 (left) does not have to repay the money which he claims was stolen. Since being the youngest person to be given in ASBO in 2000 he has racked up more than 100 arrests (pictured right, aged 16) But of the £47,000 he made illegally, Madigan will only have to repay £22,762 as the remainder, kept beneath his kitchen sink, was allegedly stolen. Nottingham Crown Court heard how the 27-year-old did not know what had happened to the haul of cash and changed his story when questioned, first telling prosecutors the money had been taken by masked robbers and later claiming a carer had stolen it. In November last year Madigan was jailed after coercing two men into firing shots at the house of a man losing some of his drugs money, the court heard. He admitted to possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, two charges of using another person to hide a firearm and three drug offences. The career criminal was jailed last year for a drive-by shooting and three drug offences following more than a decade of offences. He is pictured, right, leaving youth court as a teenager . The 27-year-old's lawyer told Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) his 'relationship with police is not always at the forefront of his mind' All the money available in his bank account - some £22,000 - has been seized but the remainder of the proceeds from his criminal activity will not have to be repaid. Madigan was paralysed from the chest down following a car accident and is now in a wheelchair. Michael Evans QC, defending, told the court: 'My Lord will understand his relationship with police is not always at the forefront of his mind.'","Declan Madigan, now 27, was described as a 'one-boy crime wave' in 2000 .

"A mother has revealed how 20 doctors dismissed her baby daughter’s rare cancer as a birthmark - until it grew to the size of a grapefruit. Yvonne Bull, 32, claims she was told there was 'nothing to worry about' when her baby Isabel was born with a purple mark on the left-hand side of her face. But now the little girl is undergoing chemotherapy after the mark, which was found to be a tumour, trebled in size within a month and covered her left ear. Isabel, who is four months old, is recovering after she lost her ear when medics carried out an operation to remove the growth. Isabel, pictured with parents Anthony Roch and Yvonne Bull, needed to have her left ear removed but doctors believed the problem was merely a birthmark . Ms Bull, a nurse from Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, said medics told her that the purple mark, which was originally the size of a golf ball, was simply a 'strawberry' birthmark. As the mark began to grow and bleed, she repeatedly took Isabel back to hospital but she said doctors prescribed only a . medication to shrink birthmarks. After a series of visits, Isabel was eventually referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where tests found she was suffering from an extremely rare sarcoma tumour. Further results showed the aggressive cancer had spread to her bone marrow, which meant she had to undergo chemotherapy. Ms Bull, a mother of four, said Isabel faced an uncertain future as the cancer could return. 'When she was born they (doctors and nurses) brought the baby over and said ""she has a small lump"",' Ms Bull said. Yvone Bull (left) said her daughter Isabel's tumour (right) trebled in size within a month, but doctors only prescribed medication for birthmarks . 'I thought ""that's not a small lump, it is massive"". I was crying, I had never seen anything like it before. It was just ginormous. 'It was supposed to be a happy day but it wasn’t at all. 'They tried to reassure us and said it was a strawberry birthmark but it just did not look right. 'We must have seen 20 doctors and they never questioned the original diagnosis, they just all said ""it’s a birthmark"" and told us not to worry.' Ms Bull, who lives with partner Anthony Roch, 37, a recruitment consultant, had a 4D scan at 34 weeks into her pregnancy - which showed no abnormalities. Isabel was born by planned Caesarean on March 1 at Poole Hospital in Dorset and weighed a healthy 7lb 1oz. She was taken for an ultrasound examination an hour after birth, and doctors concluded the mark was only a birthmark. Isabel's mark ruptured when parents Anthony Roch (left) and Yvonne Bull (right) gave her a bath . But Ms Bull insisted on further investigation and Isabel underwent an MRI scan at Southampton Hospital on March 6. She said: 'The doctor was really nonchalant and said ""I bet on my life that it is a birthmark, I don’t want to see you for a year"". 'We had to chase the results for about two to three weeks. Luckily, another doctor at the hospital saw them and we were referred to Great Ormond Street for a review.' But as the family waited for their April 19 appointment in London, Isabel’s mark began to grow and trebled in size. They returned to Poole Hospital on April 5 and stayed for four days. Doctors remained insistent that the tumour was a birthmark and prescribed propanolol to shrink it. Yvonne Bull is considering legal action over her baby daughter's care . But the mark began to blister and, on April 16, it ruptured while Ms Bull and Mr Roch were giving Isabel a bath. They returned to Poole Hospital and demanded that Isabel stay in for observation for the next three days until her appointment. On April 19 Isabel was taken by ambulance to Great Ormond Street Hospital, where an ear, nose and throat consultant ordered a biopsy. The biopsy was performed a day later. On April 24, Isabel's parents were given the devastating news that she had cancer and it had spread to her bone marrow. The baby underwent a six-hour operation to remove the cancerous cells on April 29 and she began chemotherapy on May 1. Ms Bull, who is considering legal action, said Isabel had lost an ear and had a large scar on her face. Doctors have also warned the family that the girl may suffer from speech and language difficulties in the future. But Ms Bull said: 'To consider what she has gone through in such a short space of time, she is amazing, absolutely amazing. 'She is an absolute pleasure to be around.'Isabel's parents have seen a solicitor and are planning to take legal advice against the hospital. A spokesman for Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are very concerned to hear the family is unhappy with the care their daughter received, and would urge them to contact us directly so we can discuss these fully and answer any questions they may have. 'We have a duty to protect our patients’ confidentiality and it would not be appropriate for us to comment further.' A spokeswoman for University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust declined to comment.","Yvonne Bull, 32,  claims medics told her not to worry when daughter Isabel was born with purple mark on her face .

"A second soldier has been killed in Afghanistan this week the Ministry of Defence said today. The soldier from 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment was killed during an operation to disrupt insurgent activity in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand Province. His family has been told. The death was announced after the MoD named a soldier killed in a grenade blast on Wednesday as Lance Corporal James Ashworth from the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. Extraordinary courage: Lance Corporal James Ashworth from the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guard, who was killed while 'leading his team from the front' The two deaths this week bring the total killed in Afghanistan since operations began in October 2001, to 419 among UK forces. Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Major Ian Lawrence said, following the second death: 'It is with deep sorrow that I must confirm that a soldier from 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment has been killed by enemy action whilst deployed on operations in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand Province. 'The thoughts of all within Task Force Helmand are with his family and friends at this difficult time.' The death comes just just two days after Lance Corporal James Ashworth was killed in a grenade blast while on patrol in the north of Nahr-e Saraj district in Helmand Province on Wednesday. He died despite receiving immediate medical treatment. The family of the 23-year-old from Kettering, Northamptonshire, said: 'We are devastated by the loss of our son, brother, uncle and boyfriend. 'He meant the world to everyone and has left an irreplaceable hole in our hearts. We ask that we are given time to grieve and we sincerely thank everyone for their condolences.' L/Cpl Ashworth’s father Duane served as a Grenadier Guard and his brother Coran, 21, is currently serving with the Army in Northern Ireland. He lived with his mother Kerryann and his girlfriend Emily in Kettering, and also leaves sisters Lauren and Paige, brother Karl and four-year-old niece Darcy. L/Cpl Ashworth was killed trying to protect his colleagues, said Captain Mike Dobbin, Commander of Reconnaissance Platoon, Nijmegen Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. 'L/Cpl Ashworth was killed while fighting his way through compounds, leading his fire team from the front, whilst trying to protect his men and he showed extraordinary courage to close on a determined enemy. The two soldiers killed this week brings the total number of deaths in Afghanistan to 419 among UK service personnel . 'His professionalism under pressure and ability to remain calm in what was a chaotic situation is testament to his character. 'L/Cpl Ashworth was a pleasure to command and I will sorely miss his calming influence on the battlefield. Softly spoken, he stepped up to every task thrown in his direction.' He said the platoon had lost a 'strong commander, outstanding soldier and dear friend'. L/Cpl Ashworth joined the Army at the age of 17 and completed a stint of ceremonial duty in London after joining Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards. He spent three years with the Guards’ Parachute Platoon, part of 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, deploying in Afghanistan with them. He returned to the Grenadiers, serving in Canada with The Queen’s Company before moving to the Reconnaissance Platoon. L/Cpl Ashworth had recently been promoted to the role of non commissioned officer. Lieutenant Colonel James Bowder, Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, said: 'L/Cpl Ashworth was an outstanding soldier whose loss has moved us all. Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which is close to Nad-e Ali district, where the second soldier this week was killed . 'A real self-starter, he excelled in everything that he undertook. Fit, strong and brilliant at his job, he set the bar very high. 'Indeed, such was his calmness under pressure, his charisma, and his selflessness that he made an exemplary junior leader.' He said the regiment would 'never forget this quite exceptional man'. L/Cpl Ashoworth played for his battalion’s football team, most recently during a French military tour, as well as a local team when at home. Colour Sergeant Andy Austin, Second in Command of Reconnaissance Platoon, Nijmegen Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, said: 'His great love of the beautiful game was shared by myself and others in the platoon. 'After every match day in the Premier League we would discuss the day’s events with great interest, especially the fortunes of his beloved Tottenham Hotspur - these conversations I will miss terribly. 'This was a man destined for great things in the Army and whose potential I watched flourish in the platoon.' Guardsman Gareth Loftus, Reconnaissance Platoon, Nijmegen Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, added: 'Selfless, brave, courageous - words like these don’t come close to what Ash demonstrated that day. 'He will be missed by all as a commander but most of all a good mate.'","Lance Corporal James Ashworth, 23, from Kettering has been named as the soldier killed on Wednesday .

"A British woman jailed for a year for trying to attend a men's volleyball game in Iran has still not been told her sentence. Ghoncheh Ghavami was involved in a protest outside a volleyball arena in Tehran in June 20 against a ban on women attending male sporting events in the Islamic republic. Ms Ghavami, who holds both British and Iranian passports, was found guilty of 'propagating against the ruling system'. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25 (right with her mother Susan, 49) was accused of 'propaganda against the regime' Evidence: This is the photo, taken after the women were prevented from entering the match, which was used by the Iranian regime as supposed evidence of propaganda against the state. Miss Ghavami is circled . Her family said she was arrested following a misunderstanding and has been jailed after a trial held behind closed doors. Her brother Iman Ghavami has been campaigning for the release of his sister, who is being held in solitary confinement inside Tehran's notorious Evin prison. He told the Telegraph: 'Ghoncheh doesn’t even know that she has received a year in prison. We understand she is now back on a more severe hunger strike, where she is refusing water as well as food. She must be in a very bad state – especially as she is in a terrible part of Evin prison.' Mr Ghavami has started a petition calling on the British government to campaign for his sister's release. So far, more than 700,000 people have signed the petition, with a further 25,000 liking a Facebook page associated with the campaign. Miss Ghavami was released on bail but then arrested when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station a week later, when the authorities discovered she had dual British-Iranian citizenship. The family were not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial of Miss Ghavami (pictured) Her mother Susan (left) told supporters: 'When they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face' She was thrown into solitary confinement in Iran's notorious Evin political prison and was held for more than 100 days, including 41 days in solitary. Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said: 'This is an appalling verdict. 'It's an outrage that a young woman is being locked up simply for peacefully having her say about how women are discriminated against in Iran. 'Ghoncheh is a prisoner of conscience and the Iranian authorities should quash the sentence and release her immediately and unconditionally. 'The authorities should also investigate allegations that Ghoncheh was subjected to death threats by her interrogators and provide compensation for her arbitrary detention and her prolonged solitary confinement.' Amnesty also insists that the charge against Ghavami did not amount to an internationally-recognisable criminal offence and that she has been jailed solely for her peaceful activities to end discrimination against women. Iran's judiciary denies that the charges against Miss Ghavami are linked to her attempts to watch the Iran-Italy volleyball match in June. She is accused of 'propaganda against the regime' in the Islamic republic and a spokesman said the charge was linked to national security. Miss Ghavami, a law graduate from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, carried out a 14-day hunger strike in protest against her detention. Ms Ghavami, 25, has been held in solitary confinement at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison (pictured) Detained: Miss Ghavami was arrested after trying to watch a men's volleyball match at the Azadi Stadium . Protest: Social media campaigns have sprung up in a bid to pressurise Iran into releasing Miss Ghavami . Her British-born mother Susan, 49, wrote to her daughter's supporters on Facebook last month. Mrs Ghavami said: 'Before the commencement, when they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face and gave her as much comfort as I could in that brief time.' The family was not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial but Mrs Ghavami said they were allowed a brief and emotional family reunion once the session had finished. She said: 'All of us gathered together for 20 minutes, [the] first time in hundred something days. Ghoncheh kept kissing her grandfather who she hasn't seen for all these 109 days and kept weeping.' Mrs Ghavami, who met and married Iranian surgeon Houshang Azam Ghavami after moving to Iran, said she had hand-fed her daughter to assure herself that her hunger strike was over. The family has spoken of their fears for her health after saying she seemed pale and weak during a prison visit. Iran does not recognise dual nationality and views Miss Ghavami as an Iranian citizen, but Prime Minister David Cameron has raised her case with Iran's president Hassan Rouhani when the two leaders met last month. Speaking before the hearing, her brother Iman, 28, said Miss Ghavami had only been allowed to meet her lawyer two days before the trial. He said she travelled to Iran to work for a charity teaching literacy to street children. Mr Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, West London, said his sister had thought women were allowed to attend international volleyball matches and has called her arrest was 'a truly tragic misunderstanding'. A petition organised by the family has gathered more than 600,000 signatures and Mr Ghavami told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We want the authorities to know the whole world is watching.'","Law graduate Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, tried to watch match in Tehran .

"A California boy who was electrocuted at his birthday party is out of a medically induced coma and able to speak. Ten-year-old Elijah Belden's continued recovery was revealed in a Sunday post on a Facebook page run by his family, called 'Pray for Elijah Belden.' Belden was awake and his eyes were open in an accompanying image posted by his family. 'Smiling so big we could all eat a banana sideways,' the post said. 'Praise the Lord. Elijah has been extubated tonight. Getting better: Elijah Belden is now out of a medically induced coma and able to speak . Injured: Elijah Belden suffered an electric shock after touching an electrified metal pole outside his family's home . 'Words just can't express how happy mom and dad are that our son was able to tell us his name moments after the tube was removed. Thank you Jesus for answered prayer. Elijah and our family have definitely felt your prayers. Tomorrow we will not only be celebrating Elijah's 10th birthday but we will be truly celebrating his life. Continue to #prayforelijah7 as we hit the road to recovery.' On Monday, a Facebook post provided further updates. 'As can be expected, he became very confused last night so in order to help him get rest he needed to begin his rehabilitation, he needed to be sedated,' it said. 'They say he now makes the 'calls' on slowly getting off the medications based on his reactions as they make small changes. 'Mom & Dad are so thankful the tube is out and for the small victories every day. They've been told many times life in the PICU is like a roller coaster and this is definitely proving to be true.' Elijah's father Tony Belden earlier told The Press-Enterprise that Elijah had seemed to touch a metal post during the October 4 party near the pool and fell to the ground. At the time of the electric shock, Elijah and another boy were taking a photo together, he told the newspaper. Nearby electric lights could have been responsible, the newspaper reported. Support: His family earlier shared this image on Facebook showing him in the hospital. Doctors found he has not suffered any damage to his brain of heart . Support: His mother Aly tried to help him but also suffered a shock while her husband heard their screams . His mother Aly Belden and his baseball coach were both shocked when they tried to help, Tony Belden told the newspaper, though they did not suffer injuries. 'She thought [Elijah] was dead,' Belden told The Press-Enterprise. 'I heard, ""Elijah's down."" Hearing that, I was so disconcerted... I couldn't even figure out how to dial 911.' But his son was eventually taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he continues to receive treatment. The 'Pray for Elijah Belden' Facebook page currently has over 7,000 likes on Facebook. Photos on the page show multiple well-wishers have worn ribbons for Belden with the number 7 - the number on his baseball jersey - and also pink socks as a way to raise awareness. Scene: The youngster was playing near the family's pool (pictured center) when he posed with a friend for a photograph and suffered the electric shock .","Elijah Belden suffered an electric shock at his 10th birthday party when he posed for a photo and held on to a metal pole supporting a patio cover .

"A major computer crash caused chaos at Heathrow last night - disabling the airport's baggage  system and leaving planes unable to park at their respective gates to unload. Hundreds of passengers sat stranded on the tarmac for hours with departing flights also being prevented from leaving the London airport. A Heathrow spokesman acknowledged the IT glitch but insisted it did not lead to any delays and that pilots had misinformed any passengers who thought otherwise. The systems failure also led to angry scenes inside terminals - and astonishingly many BA flights took off without passengers' luggage to relieve pressure on the airport. Scroll down for video . A major computer crash has disabled the baggage system at Heathrow Airport leaving thousands of passenger stranded on the airport's runways (file picture) One passenger, Karen Theedom, wrote on Twitter: 'We are going, minus baggage! It will be fine, I have a sense of humour. I hear NYC is pretty good for shopping!' Another particularly unlucky passenger arrived in Hong Kong, having missed his connection flight to Taipei, only to discover his luggage was still in London. Despite claiming their system 'was back up and running' at 9pm, many passengers tweeted their dismay at still sitting aboard stationary planes as late as 1am. Sally Silver tweeted: 'An hour and a half on the plane at #heathrow and counting! Why do they let us on when they know we aren't going anywhere. 'And there is no guarantee our luggage will be there when we do eventually get there!! @EGYPTAIR @HeathrowAirport #heathrow.' Earlier, a pilot on one stranded plane told passengers that electronic boards informing him what gate to park at were not working. British Airways was hit hardest with 23 of its jets being delayed - with six long-haul Virgin flights also late to leave. Hundreds of others passengers took to Twitter to express their anger at the situation. Andrea Cecile Cohen wrote: ‏'Stuck on the plane New York bound, but not going anywhere. Computer crash to do with luggage..Great could be hours.. All #heathrow affected.' Another passenger claimed that people were becoming increasingly annoyed as little information was being given to them. The man, on a 18.05 flight to New York, said: 'The captain has told us there's a computer crash which is nationally affecting airlines and airports in Southern England and most of Europe. Flights have been prevented from taking off while those that have landed at the London airport have been stuck on the tarmac for hours - with one pilot admitting: 'This looks like quite a big problem' 'People are getting quite impatient. I think what they're doing now is rebooting all the computers and trying to get the system up and running.' The pilot on the New York plane was recorded as saying: 'It looks like quite a big problem. Last time this happened it affected all the airports in Europe and southern England. It's a big issue' A passenger on another plane, Momchil V. Michailov tweeted: 'Just landed from Boston. Apparently BA luggage system is down and they can't process bags.' He later added: 'We were just told that we will wait on tarmac for some time & then wait even longer at gate due to ""chaos"" & lack of staff''.' There have also been angry scenes at the airport's baggage reclaim areas with some witnesses describing the situation as 'chaotic'. A spokesman for Heathrow Airport earlier played down the problem, claiming that all flights were on schedule but that there had been a problem with the telephone system in Terminal 1. She said: 'We were experiencing disruption due to an IT problem but our systems are now back up and running.' Up to 200,000 passengers pass through Heathrow every day with around 1,400 flights taking off and landing. Every day more than 200,000 bags are put through the airport's security system. Many of the flights affected are British Airways. A statement from the airline reads: 'We are experiencing some disruption as a result of an issue with one of Heathrow Airport’s IT systems. 'We are working with the airport to resolve the matter and customers should check ba.com for the very latest information about their flights. 'We are sorry for any disruption to customers’ travel plans.'","Flights prevented from taking off for up to three hours at London airport .

"The Duchess of Cornwall wore a regal shade of dark blue to attend the National Harvest Service in Birmingham. Beaming from under a matching velvet hat the 67-year-old met dignitaries and clergy outside St Philip's Cathedral before heading inside where she was greeted by schoolchildren who showed her their harvest boxes of food which will be sent to the Birmingham Central Food Bank for distribution.

The fashion conscious Duchess gave the outfit a more youthful twist by adding a white collar and cuffs. She was seen speaking to dignitaries and receiving bunches of flowers from local children before going inside for the ceremony. A group of 360 schoolchildren then took centre stage as they presented the Royal with their harvest boxes - filled with home-grown produce. The cathedral also welcomed the new 'Harvest Torch' - a symbolic sculpture which will pass from host city to host city. At the end of the service, the harvest boxes were collected by a historic horse-drawn trolley and taken to the Birmingham Central Food Bank for distribution. The National Harvest Service was first held at Westminster Abbey last year and is being held as part of Love British Food's campaign to rekindle marking the harvest. Before the service Camilla was also introduced to some local farm animals, and appeared to give a jokey warning to a goat during the tour of the pens – eight years after she was attacked by one which tried to grab her handbag. The Duchess of Cornwall famously wrestled the bag back from a nanny in May 2006 when the animal tried to snatch it from her on a visit to a creamery in Northern Ireland. The Duchess looked understandably a tad skeptical as she was taken for a closer inspection of the goats by farmer Richard Craddock (left) from Hatton Adventure World . But yesterday, the Duchess made sure she kept a safer distance when she spotted the animals outside Birmingham Cathedral and gave her handbag to a minder. Camilla was taken for a closer inspection of the goats by farmer Richard Craddock from Hatton Adventure World. She was spotted leaning over to look at the animals who were in a metal-fenced pen.

Mr Craddock, manager of Hatton Adventure World, near Warwick, said: 'Camilla seemed very comfortable with the animals.

"The high street crisis deepened yesterday after City watchdogs launched an investigation into bogus profit claims at Tesco while Sainsbury’s revealed a disastrous fall in sales. The giants are suffering because middle income families have switched to Aldi and Lidl in what industry experts see as the biggest change in shopping habits in 30 years. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is investigating allegations that Tesco executives ‘cooked the books’ to make it appear the company made £250m extra in profits. The FCA is investigating Tesco under the Financial Services Markets Act to establish whether it was guilty of issuing incorrect, false or misleading information to investors . The scandal came against the backdrop of the fact that millions of customers have switched to the thriving budget chains. This same threat is turning the screw on Sainsbury’s, which yesterday revealed that sales were down by 2.8per cent over the last three months compared to a year ago. The FCA is investigating Tesco under the Financial Services Markets Act to establish whether it was guilty of issuing incorrect, false or misleading information to investors. Four of the company’s most senior executives, including UK managing director, Chris Bush, have been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation that is likely to take more than six months. Last month, Tesco told the City that profits for the six months to August 23 were about £1.1bn, however this was not correct and the real figure was some £250million lower . The City watchdog has the power to demand the company hands over documents and emails, while executives can be compelled to take part in interviews to explain their actions. Last month, Tesco told the City that profits for the six months to August 23 were about £1.1bn, however this was not correct and the real figure was some £250million lower. Tesco launched its own inquiry involving outside accountants and lawyers, however the FCA has decided the situation is so serious that it needs to investigate. If it finds evidence of wrong-doing, penalties range from public censure through to large fines for the company and individuals. In a worst case scenario, it is possible executives might be guilty of market abuse which could, in theory, lead to a prosecution for criminal misconduct and a jail sentence. All of the ‘big four’ supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – have come under fierce pressure from the budget chains. At the same time, families are buying less food and they have turned away from using big hypermarkets in favour of making smaller, more regular purchases from convenience stores. The established chains have been dragged into a price war to try and keep customers happy, but this is decimating their profits. The Tesco scandal has wiped more than £3billion off the company’s share value in the last ten days, while the shares in other grocers have also suffered. The new chief executive of Sainsbury’s Mike Coupe said food shopping is undergoing its biggest change in the 30 years he has been in the industry. The company has responded by slashing up to 5p a litre off the price of fuel in order to get people through the door. It has also introduced a new promise to ‘Brand Match’ the lower prices charged by Asda. The same store sales at Sainsbury’s for the three months to September 27 were down 2.8per cent on the same period last year. Looking ahead, it fears sales over the crucial Christmas period to be down on a year ago. Mr Couple explained the fall, saying: ‘The market remains dynamic and fiercely competitive. The long-running trend of more frequent, convenient shopping has accelerated, resulting in smaller basket sizes. ‘Our performance has been impacted by the accelerated pace of change in the grocery market, including significant pricing activity.’ Julie Palmer, retail expert at Begbies Traynor, offered a grim assessment, saying: ‘The supermarket price war has taken its toll on Sainsbury’s whose fantastic run of growth over nine years under former CEO Justin King has come to an abrupt end. ‘Performance over the last quarter has been very weak and the pressure is now on Mike Coupe to reassure shareholders that they are not sleepwalking into a Tesco-like crisis. 'Sainsbury’s will need to pull out all the stops over the next few months if it is to escape the worst of the malaise set to descend upon the UK’s big four grocers’ ‘The announcement to cut 5p off fuel and simplifying it’s ‘Brand Match’ offer will do little to mask the disappointing figures. ‘With the all-important Christmas trading season approaching, it will be interesting to see if this strategy of lowering prices on thousands of its products will be enough to deter competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl who seem to have the most attractive offering to shoppers looking for value.’ Analyst at Planet Retail, David Gray, said: ‘These results mark a watershed moment for both Sainsbury’s and the wider UK grocery industry. The sharp decline in like-for-like and total sales at the retailer will send shockwaves across the market. ‘First it was Tesco, then Morrisons, and now even Sainsbury’s is reeling from the effects of seismic structural changes rumbling across the UK food sector. No-one is immune to the effects and there is no hiding place.’ He added: ‘No gaping holes in the company accounts and a slightly less diabolical performance than Tesco are hardly achievements to shout about. Sainsbury’s will need to pull out all the stops over the next few months if it is to escape the worst of the malaise set to descend upon the UK’s big four grocers.’","City watchdogs launched an investigation into bogus profit claims at Tesco while Sainsbury’s revealed a disastrous fall in sales .

"With the half-term break just around the corner, a soaring pound could save holidaymakers hundreds. Prices have plunged at popular European resorts and travellers are seeing their money go further in other exotic destinations around the world. And sterling has surged to six-year high against the euro with many resorts also slashing prices as they vie for custom. Costs have plummeted by up to 20 per cent over the past year in 10 out of 12 worldwide destinations, according to the Post Office's latest Winter Sunshine Report. Winter sun: Goods in popular tourist resorts such as Spain will cost families less than last year this half term . The report, which compared the total cost of eight travel 'basket' items, priced all at just £44.03 in Costa del Sol . 1. Cup of filter coffee at cafe/bar . 2. Bottle of local lager at cafe/bar . 3. Bottle/can of Coca Cola at cafe/bar . 4. Glass of wine at cafe/bar . 5. Bottle of mineral water (1.5L) at supermarket . 6. Suncream at supermarket . 7. Insect repellent at supermarket . 8. Three-course evening meal for two (including a bottle of wine) Post Office Travel Money researchers have compared prices for a basket of eight items to compile a barometer of prices in popular holiday locations. Top of the list for value for money was the Costa del Sol, in Spain, where holidaymakers can enjoy a three-course family meal for £32.49, a cup of coffee for just under £1 and a glass of wine for around £1.40. It was followed by Bali, Indonesia, where a meal for two comes in at just £37.60 and a bottle or can of Coca Cola costs just 50p. The Algarve, Portugal, takes third place, where the basket, which also includes suncream, mineral water and insect repellent, costs £47.87 - 11 per cent down on last year. In fourth place is Sri Lanka where price drops of 19 per cent since last October mean families can enjoy a meal with a bottle of wine for around £41.78. The overall cost for a basket of goods in Sri Lanka came out at £55.26 with Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, coming fifth in the league at £58. Bali, Indonesia, came in second in best value for money destinations, with travel basket items tallying £47.21 .

Total basket cost: £159.34 (+8% from 2013) There are good deals to be had in a few further-flung destinations including Tobago where prices are down 18 per cent from last year. A meal will set visitors back around £51.31 with a glass of wine costing £2.64 and a can of cola 74p. At Mauritius's coastal village of Grand Baie resort prices are down 15 per cent with a bottle of lager at a local cafe or bar costing £2.13, a bottle of mineral water 53p and a meal just over £81.83. Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said: 'It's fantastic news that the cost of holidaying to many popular destinations is going down just as we head into winter and the colder months of the year. Tobago in the Caribbean is another good bargain resort destination, with prices down 18% from last year . Likewise, the coastal town of Grand Baie in Mauritius has seen travel essential prices drop by 15% . 'It's a combination of the strength of the pound against many currencies we like to take our winter breaks in, coupled with local hoteliers and tourist businesses fighting for our holiday spending money by slashing prices in resort for everything from eating out to entrances to popular attractions. 'Ensuring you get your slice of winter sun need not cost you the earth. 'In fact it's the earth you may well be exploring knowing your money will go a long way in the likes of Sri Lanka and other destinations near and far this winter.' Currently £1 (based on an exchange of £500) will buy 1.232 euros compared to 1.14 euros last October, an increase of around eight per cent in the past 12 months. The strong value of the pound means savings for those heading further afield, such as the Dominican Republic . In Rodney Bay, St Lucia, the cost of those travel 'basket' items will set you back £105.88 - down 12% from 2013 . The strong value of Sterling against several currencies means those heading further afield can save money on trips to Thailand, the Dominican Republic and St Lucia. The tropical Island of Phuket, Thailand, has seen resort prices drop eight per cent with a family meal costing £52.44, a bottle of cola 55p and a glass of wine £3.05. In Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, where prices have fallen three per cent, a cup of coffee costs just under a pound with a meal at £88.62 and alcohol slightly moire pricey with a glass of wine at £6.12. At Rodney Bay, St Lucia, where prices have fallen 12 per cent, a cup of coffee costs £1.62, a bottle of lager £2.25 and a family meal with wine £86.10. The only destinations where prices have risen out of the 12 were Dubai and Orlando, Florida. Prices have actually risen in Orlando, Florida, USA, where costs are up 17% from last year . In Jumeirah, Dubai, prices have likewise increased, with the eight travel items now totaling £159.34 . Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'Families can look forward to seeing their holiday money stretch further in winter sun Eurozone resorts as well as in many of the popular long haul destinations we surveyed for autumn half term holidays. 'The trick is do some advance holiday homework and pick a destination where resort prices are low and where the pound still packs a powerful punch. 'That's certainly true of resorts in Spain, Portugal and Cyprus, thanks to the strength of sterling, and people planning trips further afield can benefit from low resort charges in Sri Lankan resorts and the perennial favourite Phuket.' A three-course evening meal  will set you back a whopping £115.23 in Dubai - though the views are lovely . Sean Tipton, spokesman for travel association Abta, said: 'With half term rapidly approaching the strength of the pound makes a foreign break really good value for money. 'Not many people travel overseas in the autumn so hotels will lower their prices and you won't have to put up with the crowds you see in the summer. 'Plus if you're looking for good weather temperatures in Southern Europe and Turkey are still in the mid-twenties with good sunshine, so the beach is still an option.'

"Period dramas such as Downton Abbey have fuelled the boom in demand for starched collars, the owner of the Barker Group laundry, which specialises in the collars, has claimed . A century ago they were the essential complement to the English stiff upper lip, before falling out of fashion for being, well, rather too stiff. Now starched collars are enjoying something of a revival – thanks to Downton Abbey. A laundry in Bournemouth, which claims to offer the world's only traditional starched collar service, says TV period dramas are fuelling a boom in demand for its skills. The Barker Group now produces around 80,000 stiff collars a year for clients all over the world, who include royalty, the judiciary and the military. Owner Matthew Barker has supplied collars for movie blockbusters such as Sherlock Holmes and Titanic, as well as TV series including Downton and Poirot. Mr Barker said: 'The market place that has really grown most significantly in the last five years is theatre, television and film. There are a lot more period dramas now, shows like Downton Abbey. 'Any period drama you see on television where they are wearing starched collars, generally we have supplied them. It's bizarre seeing your product everywhere, but great.' Pensioner Alice Allen, who had 57 years' experience of making starched collars at a London laundry, was hired to teach Barker Group staff how to hone their skills. She had worked at a laundry in London making collars from the age of 13 until it closed when she was 80. Mr Barker paid for her to come to Bournemouth on several trips and teach his staff everything she knew. There are only two people working in the collar-making department of the laundry, but Mr Barker makes sure there are always three people in the business at any one time that have the skills to 'keep the knowledge alive'. 'There are 60 separate steps to the process and if you miss out any one of those elements the finished collar won't be right. Each stage is absolutely crucial,' he said. Last man starching: Owner Matthew Barker (centre) with head starcher Ron O'Kill (left) and manager Wayne St Clair proundly wearing a stiff collar . Owner Matthew Barker has supplied collars for movie blockbusters such as Sherlock Holmes and Titanic, as well as TV series including Downton Abbey and Poirot . 'Simplified, it has to be starched, brought back to a particular humidity in the drying out process, go through the roller at 200 degrees and then be ironed and polished to give it a smooth sheen, turned down and then completely aired out. 'We made an adequate collar until about 2002 and then I was introduced to Alice. It was all she had done all her life and she knew her stuff. 'We learnt a huge amount from her. She honed our skills and gave us the edge we have today. 'When I started we were doing ten collars a week, sometimes less, now we do in excess of 1,500 a week for customers in the UK, mainland Europe, America and last year we had our first client from Tokyo.'

The collar starts as a piece of cotton and goes through 60 different stages to become the finished product, with each stage being equally crucial.","Laundry in Bournemouth claims to be only starched collar service in world .

Clegg also tried on a pair of hi-tech Google glasses - and the first thing the head-mounted computer told him was that his beloved Arsenal were losing. The Deputy Prime Minister visibly flinched as the Google Glass, which projects information onto a display in front of the wearer's eye, informed him that Diego Costa had just put Chelsea 2-0 ahead in their Premier League clash with the Gunners. Mr Clegg was offered a go on the device as he visited the tech giant's exhibition stall at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow, where he was also shown an Android watch. He initially looked intrigued when he saw the football score flash up, but his interest turned to horror as it was updated seconds later. Must be a riveting speech: A delegate sleeps as Steve Webb speaks at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow . Comfy? A number of attendees were seen dozing as the Pensions Minister laid into the Tories . Mr Webb blasted Chancellor George Osborne for targeting the 'poorest people in the land' 'Oh look, Chelsea-Arsenal, one-nil to Chelsea,' said the Liberal Democrat leader, before throwing his hands up and shouting: 'No! Oh no! Another goal. Who scored?' After being told that the Glass retails at £1,000, Mr Clegg jokily pretended to slip away with the device still on his face. Meanwhile Lib Dem president Tim Farron accused the Conservatives of being 'borderline immoral' and suggested the Lib Dems would work with the biggest party in the event of a hung parliament. He told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'It's very important that people know a Conservative only government would be lacking in compassion. They are indeed the nasty party that Theresa May said they were. 'They are trying to balance the books on the backs of the poor, something which is un-British and borderline immoral. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg tries out Google Glass at a stall. He discovered Arsenal were losing on the £1,000 high-tech device . 'And the Labour party if they were allowed to govern on their own would be the incompetent rabble they were that got us into this mess in the first place.' He added: 'What happens after May next year? Well we are going to have to live with it. Whatever the outcome is we will be big enough and grown up enough to work with whoever it is the electorate say we must work with.' Mr Farron claimed the Prime Minister misled the Lib Dems during the coalition negotiations. 'Undoubtedly David Cameron pretended to be green, pretended to care about civil liberties, pretended to care about people who are less fortunate than himself and I'm afraid we've been shown none of those things were true.' Schools minister David Laws told BBC1's Sunday Politics the Lib Dems would not oust Mr Clegg if one of the other parties demanded his removal as part of any coalition deal. 'We are not having some other party tell us who our leader is. Nobody is going to dictate to the Liberal Democrats who leads the party. We will decide that ourselves and we have decided that.' Asked about polling for the programme that showed only one third of Lib Dem candidates were planning to put Mr Clegg on their election leaflets, he said: 'From real candidates who are going out now ... we are delighted to put Nick Clegg on our leaflets, we are very proud of what he has done in government.'","Deputy PM was seen sipping tiny sampler of beer at exhibition stand .

"This dramatic video shows the moment a wild goose chase brought Britain's busiest motorway to a standstill. A Canada goose injured its wing on the M25 after crash-landing near junction 9, causing chaos as it waddled in a daze along the hard shoulder. Lorries and cars came so perilously close to colliding with the bird that the Highways Agency imposed a road block, allowing rescuers to safely remove the goose on the loose. Scroll down for video . Goose on the loose: The M25 was brought to a standstill after a goose crash-landed on the motorway . Wild goose chase: The road was closed off as rescuers charged down the carriageway, looking for the bird which was unable to take off again because of its injuries . Road block: The drama caused the Highways Agency to shut off the road while the rescue took place . The animal rescue volunteers carried nets as they searched for the bird, but it was too dangerous with traffic roaring past . The goose was spotted wandering next to the hard shoulder of the M25 near junction 9 on October 19 . A team from Wildlife Aid UK rushed to the scene to capture the stricken bird, which could not take off because of its damaged wing. As rescuers arrived, it quickly became apparent that traffic needed to be stopped if they were going to safely catch the goose. The Highways Agency blocked the road, bringing the section of the M25 to a halt as the pair of Wildlife Aid UK workers, Cristina Flamini and Ron Turner, close in on the goose. For a moment, the video, shot on October 19, appears to show that the goose has got away, only for it to emerge from a hedge on the motorway's embankment. After a short struggle through the trees at the side of the road, the rescue team get hold of the bird. The goose seems safe and well, if a little shaken, as it is carried into a car and taken to a veterinary hospital in Leatherhead, Surrey.

"Eighteen months after bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev inflicted terror on the city of Boston, his widow has been pictured quietly settling into her new life in New Jersey. Stony-faced as she carries out her daily chores, Katherine Russell has been pictured out and about in North Bergen, where she and her three-year-old daughter, Zahara, are reportedly living with her husband's sisters. Zahara was just a baby when her father caused unthinkable tragedy on April 15, 2013. As the images show, Russell, 25, continues to wear a hijab, proving that she is still living a strict Muslim life despite rumors that her family was pushing her to embrace Christianity after the attacks. New life: Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is pictured in North Bergen, New Jersey, where she lives with her three-year-old daughter Zahara, the daughter of Tsarnaev . Out and about: Russell, pictured out near her home on Tuesday, continues to wear a hijab despite reports her family were encouraging her to embrace Christianity again after the bombing . And rather than shun her husband's family, WCVB discovered in August that she had moved in with his sisters Ailina and Bella. The women were found  living in a nondescript blue house in North Bergen, which is located about 10 miles west of Manhattan and 200 miles from Boston. It was also reported earlier this year that she had remarried and had another baby, but there were no signs of the child this week. Ailina and Bella's 20-year-old brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is currently awaiting federal trial for his role in the 2013 bombing that killed three people and left more than 260 others wounded. Russell, from Rhose Island, converted to Islam after meeting Tsarnaev in a nightclub . The two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia were accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line. The search for the brothers lasted days, but after they shot dead MIT officer Sean Collier and fled, they were cornered by police officers in Watertown. A gun battle ensued and Tamerlan was killed. Dzhokhar hit him as he fled in their getaway car, but the younger brother was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a resident's backyard. He was hospitalized with injuries but later charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. His trial is set for November. Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor. At home: She reportedly lives with her husband's two sisters at the home in North Bergen . Russell appeared subdued as she walked along,  her face hidden behind glasses . In 2010, the promising young artist and good student dropped out of college, converted to Islam and married Tamerlan, whom she had met at a nightclub. The couple had a daughter. The young family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they settled in a cramped apartment and attended prayers in a Boston Islamic center. After her husband's death, Russell went to live with her parents in Rhode Island. They reportedly tried to convince her to stop being so strict about her faith. Russell's attorney Amato DeLuca claimed his client first learned that her husband was suspected of being a terrorist from news reports on TV. DeLuca said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband of anything and was focused on supporting her family, working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home health care aide. Russell has never spoken publicly about the  bombings and she was never charged in relation to the plot, although a grand jury looking into the bombings spoke with her family members. 'Former life: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured left in 2010, married Russell, pictured in her yearbook, in 2010 . Attack: The brothers planted two bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260, police said.

"Reality TV show The Block has been accused of 'faking' an environmental scare, further damaging the show's reputation. During the most recent series viewers were told the safety of the Glasshouse building at the Melbourne site was compromised by a mysterious underground tank, which held thousands of litres of fuel.

"The average cost of raising a child to secondary school age is £84,000, with half of the money being spent on childcare, according to new figures. Caring for a child from birth up until the age of 11 will set a household back by almost half the average UK house price, which stood at £187,188 in September, the survey by Halifax found. The bulk of the total £83,627-a-year bill comes from childcare before children reach school age, which at about £41,139 makes up almost half of the whole cost of raising a child to the age of 11. The average cost of raising a child to secondary school age is £84,000, a survey of 1,000 parents found . The estimates were taken from research among 1,000 parents of children aged up to 11. Typically, parents were found to be spending £633 a month on their children, adding up to £7,602 a year. The survey also found that the first year of a child's life is the most expensive, costing £8,500 on average. Food: £77.41 . Schooling: £44.85 . Holidays: £59.17 . Clothes: £38.81 . Toys: £23.42 . Leisure and hobbies: £39.23 . Furniture: £18.35 . Personal care: £20.64 . Childcare: £311.66 . Total monthly cost: £633.54 . As children reach school age and less money is needed to go towards childcare, the annual cost of raising a child falls to around £6,489. The survey also took into account the amount spent on food during a child’s lifetime, with parents forking out the most to feed their youngsters when they are aged between nine and 11. The average monthly spend on food for this age was found to be £87, while those with children aged five to eight years old spent £71 per month. Holiday costs were also found to reach a peak for parents when children hit the ages of between five and eight. The amount spent on trips for the average family was said to average around £71 per month.

"Thai police investigating the murder of two British backpackers tried to bribe a taxi driver to give false evidence against a football team then beat him up when he refused, it was claimed today. Pornprasit Sukdam claims he was offered 700,000 baht (£13,300) if he agreed to be a fake witness to events leading up to the deaths of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge in Koh Tao. But when he turned down the offer, he claims the officers became angry and attacked him before releasing him on Monday evening. He said he complained to the district chief Kobchai Saowalak and asked for protection over fears of another attack after the officers said they intended to question him again yesterday. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15 . The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament . He said: 'They said they would give me 700,000 baht to be a witness but I was not a witness,' Pornprasit told Thai journalists from ASTV-Manager online, as cited by Prachatai. 'I never saw anything. Then they became angry.' Pornprasit, 37, is a member of the Sun Service Football team, who became the latest suspects in the murder inquiry when they were questioned by police last week. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Yesterday, it emerged that electronic ID wristbands could be given to all tourists visiting Thailand in the wake of the murders, the country's tourism minister has revealed. Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul said the devices would be used to help identify and locate tourists who get lost or into trouble. 'When tourists check in to a hotel they will be given a wristband with a serial number that matches their ID and shows the contact details of the resort they are staying in, so that if they're out partying late and, for example, get drunk or lost, they can be easily assisted,' Kobkarn said. The minister said there were plans for these wristbands to eventually incorporate some sort of 'electronic tracking device'. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers . She said a 'buddy system', pairing tourists with a local minder at tourist spots, was also being discussed. But Kobkarn admitted that not everybody was comfortable with the wristband idea. 'Most people welcome the idea but some hotels are concerned that tourists may not want to wear the wristbands.' Concerns have also been raised about the safety of tourists in Thailand following the murder of two Britons. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. Detectives investigating the murders on the island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence . In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 -  for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder . Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man . DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'","Pornprasit Sukdam claims he was offered £13,300 to implicate football team .

I know for a fact my husband will hate this look, but there is something fun and liberating dressing in something I know men won’t like. It makes me feel like I’m in control — almost as if I’m daring Charlie not to want me. Accessorize with a cheeky smile and you’re good to go! HE SAYS: I would trust this person to check my oil and change a tyre, but I can’t imagine taking her out for a spin. That low-slung crotch and saggy bum aren’t doing it for me. I think I can speak for most men when I say we don’t much like this shapeless, masculine look. She looks like she’s about to jump out of a plane at 30,000 ft! CHUNKY CHIC— OR JUST A FRUMPY FLOP?

HE SAYS: She looks like a flight attendant on an obscure Siberian airline! Not my favourite look. Kim’s right when she says it’s chunky — her hips look twice their usual size and the bulk of the cardigan hides all of her curves. It looks like something my grandmother would wear.

Why cover up such a gem? I love the way I can see daylight between her thighs when she wears her skinny jeans, but these are more manly and hide all of her assets. It’s a no from me.

I also love the little jacket, which adds a bit of attitude. These would work as well on a date night as they would for shopping with the girls. HE SAYS: At first glance, I thought she’d stolen my work shoes. I am actually a big fan of flats and can never understand how or why my wife tortures herself in heels, but these brogues are just too masculine, inelegant and stompy.

"For most people, a trip to the shops involves a few cars, pedestrians and perhaps a couple of stray dogs. But locals strolling in Finland and Russia were recently greeted by a more unusual sight - two moose. One of the runaway elk spent a staggering seven hours dashing through the streets of Helsinki yesterday. Scroll down for video . Moose on the loose: A runaway elk was captured dashing through the streets of Helsinki in Finland yesterday . The animal was first spotted at around 3am (1am GMT) and later captured hurtling past a dog walker by local Sakarias Laukkanen. Police were called and spent 'the rest of the night' chasing the 'erratically-behaved' animal, according to Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat. But unfortunately, at around 10am, they decided they had no choice but to shoot and kill the moose. A police spokesman said: 'They had been hoping to spare the animal by directing him towards the sea so it could swim away.' Another escapee: It comes just weeks after a drunken moose, named Monty, was spotted running trough Semenov, Russia, after eating a pile of fermented berries. Above, the animal eventually fell into a pond . Rescue: The pond's concrete sides made it impossible for Monty to climb back out, but he was saved from drowning after police took to the water with a rope. Unfortunately, his Finnish brother was shot by police . But one . resident in Helsinki, which has a population of only around 600,000, appeared less sympathetic about the animal's demise. She told the paper: 'It just shows what a small rural town Helsinki . is. I've just told my neighbour - make sure your freezer is empty as there is so much fresh meat on offer.' Meanwhile, the other moose, named Monty, was spotted on the loose in . Semenov, near Russia's Volga River, last month after chomping his way through on a pile . of fermented berries. The drunken animal was caught on camera running through the . streets, before plunging into a pond in the middle of the city. Saved: Semenov police officer Pavel Mihachkov said Monty had appeared 'bonkers on booze' during the chase . The pond's concrete sides made it impossible for him to climb back out, but he was saved from drowning after police took to the water with a rope. Semenov police officer Pavel Mihachkov said that moose - which can reach almost 7ft tall and weigh up to 1,500lbs - tend to gravitate towards the first fruit falls at this time of year. Apples, cherries, apricots and . other assorted fruits fall from trees during storms, ferment on the . ground and become an intoxicating brew for such creatures, he said. Mr Michachkov said Monty had appeared 'bonkers on booze', adding: 'It was a magnificent specimen but he . was so sozzled he could barely stand. 'He obviously found a bunch of . fermenting berries or something and really went for it. 'We . managed to rope him and get him transported to an animal shelter for . the night where he slept it off. 'Vets said the moose had the mother and . father of all hangovers the next day but he will soon be ok. 'He will be . tranquillised and driven out to a remote spot where it is hoped he won't . find his way back to the big city any time soon.' Despite Monty's plight, it is unlikely he will learn his lesson. Experts calculate moose like him get 'drunk' around 50 times in their lives.","Moose spent seven hours dashing through the Finnish capital yesterday .
