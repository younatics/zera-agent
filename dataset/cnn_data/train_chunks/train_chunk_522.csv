Bo Xilai, previously the Governor of Liaoning Province, has been expelled from government - removing his immunity from prosecution . China's parliament has expelled former senior politician Bo Xilai - paving the way for the disgraced politician to face trial over allegations he covered up the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. Xinhua News Agency said the Standing . Committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, . has 'announced the termination of Bo Xilai's post' as the deputy to the . parliament. The expulsion removes Bo's immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament - meaning he may now face trial for conspiring to cover up his wife's role in the murder of Heywood. The announcement comes a fortnight before the Communist Party holds a key congress, which opens on November 8, that will unveil the country's new central leadership. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and his former police chief, Wang Lijun, have both been jailed over the scandal, which stems from the murder of Heywood while Bo was Communist Party chief of the southwestern city of Chongqing. The government last month accused Bo of corruption and of bending the law to hush up the murder. Before Bo is charged and tried, investigators must first complete an inquiry and indict him, but China's prosecutors and courts come under party control and are unlikely to challenge the accusations. A lawyer for Bo, who has been employed by the family to represent him, said on Thursday he was unable to say whether the government would allow him to represent Bo when the case comes to trial. 'It's theatre,' said Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a New York-based advocacy group, who spoke before Bo's expulsion was announced. 'The judiciary grinds into action only when the outcome has been determined. There is no indication we will see a genuine trial because Bo knows too much.' Bo, 63, was widely seen as pursuing a powerful spot in the new leadership before his career unraveled, after Wang fled to a U.S. consulate for more than 24 hours in February and alleged that Bo's wife had poisoned Heywood. Murdered: Neil Heywood's body was found in a secluded Chongqing hotel . An official account of Wang's trial in September said Wang fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, southwest China, after Bo beat him and stripped him of his police job following Wang's decision to confront Bo with the murder allegations against Gu. Bo, a former commerce minister, used his post as Communist Party chief of Chongqing in southwest China since 2007 to cast the sprawling, haze-covered municipality into a showcase for his mix of populist policies and bold spending plans that won support from leftists yearning for a charismatic leader. Wang had spearheaded Bo's controversial campaign against organised crime, a prominent plank in Bo's barely concealed campaign to join the topmost ranks of the Communist Party. Finger pointing: Bo Xilai has been accused of corruption and bending the law to protect his wife . Bo was dismissed from his Chongqing post in March, and suspended from the party's top ranks in April, when his wife Gu was named as an official suspect in the murder in November of Heywood, a long-time friend of the couple who also helped their son Bo Guagua settle into study in Britain. Bo has disappeared from public view since he was dismissed and has not had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations against him. The removal of Bo has disrupted the Communist Party's usually secretive and carefully choreographed process of settling on a new central leadership. Sharply dressed and courting publicity, Bo stood out in a party of stolid conformists, and he promoted Chongqing as a bold egalitarian alternative to China's current pattern of growth. But Bo's promotion of 'red' culture inspired by Mao Zedong's era and his campaign-style crackdown on crime prompted fears that he was rekindling some of the arbitrary lawlessness of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s - a criticism that Premier Wen Jiabao spelled out before the public in mid-March.","Politician accused of covering up wife's involvement in death of British businessman Neil Heywood .

China is moving to within two years of deploying submarine-launched nuclear weapons and adding a new leg to its arsenal meaning it could lead to arms-reduction talks, according to a report by a congressionally mandated US commission. But in the meantime China, who will appoint a new leader on Thursday, remains the ‘most threatening’ power in cyberspace and presents the largest challenge to America’s supply chain integrity, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission said in a draft of its 2012 report to the US Congress. Beijing is ‘on the cusp of attaining a credible nuclear triad of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and air-dropped nuclear bombs,’ the report said, adding that China was alone among the five original nuclear weapons states to be expanding its nuclear forces. The others are the United States, Russia, Britain and France. Two years away: China are close to deploying submarine-launched nuclear weapons . China has had a largely symbolic ballistic missile submarine capability for decades but is only now set to establish a ‘near-continuous at-sea strategic deterrent,’ the draft said . The expansion of its nuclear forces will inevitably increase tensions in South-East Asia, which is already jittery over the strengthening of the Chinese military and its aggressive pursuit of territorial claims. It also could add to tensions with Washington, which is determined to contain China’s reach into the Pacific. The move ‘would necessarily affect Indian and Russian perceptions about the potency of their own deterrent capabilities vis-à-vis China,’ the report said. Threat: China are increasing its nuclear arsenal . China is party to a number of international pacts and regimes regarding nuclear weapons and materials, including the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. But it remains outside key arms limitation and control conventions, such as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed in April 2010 and the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The report said that Congress should require the US State Department to spell out efforts to integrate China into existing and future nuclear arms reduction, limitation, and control discussions and agreements. Congress should also ‘treat with caution’ any proposal unilaterally to reduce operational US nuclear forces without clearer information being made available to the public about China’s nuclear stockpile and force posture, it said. China is estimated to have a total of 240 nuclear warheads weapons, according to the Arms Control Association, a private nonpartisan group in Washington. In contrast, the US has 5,113, including tactical, strategic and nondeployed weapons. Side-by-side: President Hu Jintao (left) and former President Jiang Zemin (right) attend the opening session . Beijing has already deployed two of as many as five of a new class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine. The JIN-class boat is due to carry the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile with an estimated range of about 4,600 miles (7,400km). In its annual report on military and security developments involving China this year, the US Defence Department said that the new submarines and the JL-2 missile would give Chinese forces its ‘first credible sea-based nuclear capability’. Although the JL-2 programme has faced repeated delays, it could reach an initial operating capability within the next two years, said the Pentagon report, which was released in May. The final version of the report is to be released next Wednesday by the US-China commission, a 12-member bipartisan group set up in 2000 to report to Congress on security implications of US-China trade.","Country is two years from deploying subs .

Gaga fan site last night in 'celebration' of Bonfire Night. For several hours, websites promoting NBC shows such as Saturday Night Live, Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon displayed messages such as 'Remember, remember the fifth of November - the gunpowder treason and plot.' The attacks are thought to be linked to . the cyber-attack group Anonymous, which often uses a Guy Fawkes mask from . the film V for Vendetta as an emblem. On November 5th each year, the UK celebrates 'Guy Fawkes Night', where town set off fireworks and burn effigies of the conspirator who tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605. Hacked: NBC websites were replaced with crude messages by hacker 'pyknic' on Sunday . NBC and Lady Gaga were victims of an attack by hacker 'pyknic' who left references to Guy Fawkes in his wake . In 1605, Guy Fawkes led a party of conspirators into the cellars of the House of Lords, and stowed 36 barrels of gunpowder. They planned to ignite the barrels when the unpopular James I and his political elite were assembled in the chamber, and Fawkes hoped to install a Catholic monarch back to the throne. When authorities learned of the plot, on November 1, they appointed Thomas Knevitt to investigate - and he allowed the plot to continue, so that he and his . men could catch the conspirators in the act. He discovered Fawkes hiding in the cellars in the early hours of November 5, and the conspirator was tortured until he confessed - and then he was promptly executed. Every year since, effigies of Fawkes are burned across the UK. Users trying to visit the 'Shows' or 'Full Episodes' tabs on the NBC main site were instead directed to a black page with glowing lights, blasting music, and . references to Guy Fawkes Night. It appeared that the defacement of . the affected sub-sites was cleaned up in a couple of hours, with NBC and . its various websites functioning normally again by late Sunday evening. However, older versions maintained by . search engines such as Google and Bing still bore the message 'hacked . by pyknic', referring either to an individual or a group. This was followed with a warning that 'user info' and 'passwords' had been exposed by the culprit. The message ""Remember, remember the . fifth of November"" suggested a link to Anonymous, a movement of cyber . rebels which has appropriated much of the symbolism around today's Guy . Fawkes Day. Anonymous later denied responsibility for the NCBC and Lady Gaga hacks - but said they had hacked the sites of banking company PayPal, security software maker Symantec and Imageshack. The Anonymous team say they have the account details and passwords of 28,000 PayPal users, but the firm says it has no evidence of a software breach, and the websites all appear to be working normally. NBC hacked: Users looking for information on shows were met with this distorted page put up by a hacker known as 'pyknic' Googled: Searching for 'GAGA Daily' still shows the 'hacked' caption . Guy Fawkes (known as 'Guide Fawkes'), depicted with his co-conspirators, was tortured when the plot unraveled . The holiday is meant to mark the failed plot to blow up the country's parliament in 1605. However, conclusively determining responsibility for such attacks can be nearly impossible. Also defaced by 'pyknic' was a Lady . Gaga fan site, Gaga Daily, an act which drew a sympathetic message from . the pop star on Twitter. ""My little angels! help is on the . way,"" the message read, adding that ""haus of gaga techies will be on it . ... to the rescue. calling them now."" The site was soon restored.

A man uses Skype on an iPad: A security flaw has . been revealed that allows hackers to seize control of accounts using their . victim's email address . Skype was today forced to pull its password reset function after a vulnerability was revealed that allowed hackers to hijack accounts using just their victim's email address. The security flaw allowed an attacker to reset the password of any Skype users, locking victims out of their own accounts and giving the hacker total control. To exploit the vulnerability, all attackers needed to know was the email address tied to their victim's Skype account to persuade the Microsoft-owned service to provide a password reset token to given them access. The hack was first reveal on a Russian-language forum two months ago, The Next Web reported. A reporter for the tech site confirmed that the exploit was possible. 'We reproduced the attack, step-by-step, and managed to access the Skype accounts of TNW writer (with permission) Josh Ong (as well as editor Matt Brian to verify again) with only their email addresses,' Emil Protalinski wrote. 'Essentially, that email address is used to create a new account with your own email address tied to it. 'Then, minus a couple of key steps, you can use a password reset token to gain access to your target’s account.' The site's investigation showed that the hack then gave access to a victim's Skype account, revealing the target's username and allowing the attacker to change the password. Once the password was changed, the hacker gained exclusive access to the account, with the victim no longer able to log in. The Next Web explained that the hack . works because Skype sends password reminders to both the account . holder's email address and, crucially, the Skype app itself. This allows a third-party to intercept the token, redeem it and claim ownership of the victim's original username and account. Embarrassment: Skype has now disabled its password reset page until the flaw can be fixed . The security exploit is an embarrassment for Microsoft, last week announced it was shutting down its Live Messenger service and forcing users to migrate to SKype, which it bought last year in a massive $8.5billion takeover. Once alerted to the vulnerability, Skype moved quickly to disable its password reset page. Skype spokesman Leonas Sendrauskas told MailOnline: 'Early this morning we were notified of user concerns surrounding the security of the password reset feature on our website. This issue affected some users where multiple Skype accounts were registered to the same email address. 'We suspended the password reset feature temporarily this morning as a precaution and have made updates to the password reset process today so that it is now working properly. 'We are reaching out to a small number of users who may have been impacted to assist as necessary. 'Skype is committed to providing a safe and secure communications experience to our users and we apologise for the inconvenience.","Russian-language forum first revealed the vulnerability two months ago .

Stylish, sleek and impressive audio output - start-up company Root have created a worthy addition to the headphone market. The two models tested were the DJPro, priced at £89.99 and the T1, coming in at £29.99. At first glance, both have distinct styling clearly catering for very different audiences. Sound investment: DJPros are built to last . The DJPro, as the name suggests, wouldn't look out of place hugging the ears of some of the world's top DJs. Their chunky look is designed to catch the eye, while clever details like the coiled wire at the bottom, give the impression they could be slotted straight into a turntable. Although their brushed-metal effect is heavy-looking, the DJ Pros are surprisingly light-weight. They are easily adjustable, too, with comfortable, padded speakers that rest snugly on your head. Audio quality is on par with their aesthetics. Depth of sound is strong and noise reduction is effective. Purists may find the bass not quite 'deep' enough for headphones of this nature, but there's enough there for most to enjoy. Musical detail, in particular, is on par with headphones twice the price. Moving on to the T1s. These have a very different feel to the DJPros - catering to a much wider audience. And although the T1s may be the entry-level offering of Root headphones, there's nothing to suggest the company have let quality drop. It's a simpler design than the DJPros, one more suited to compliment most outfits rather than be a statement piece. Its looks are simple enough to be an attractive buy for teenagers and for younger children, while retaining a playful feel which will resonate with many adults. Queen of cool: The T1s compliment most outfits and boast strong audio quality . Sound quality is strong, although it's slightly more 'tinny' than the DJPros. There's a slight lack of low-end punch in the bass, but trebles are crisp and clean, allowing clear instrument distinction. For the price, very few that can match them. Roots may be new to the audio market but are clearly in tune with what consumers want. Whatever pair you go for, both are brilliant value for money and a sound investment for years to come.

Astronomers have discovered the oldest supernovae ever detected - two massive stars which exploded 12.5billion years ago. The cataclysmic events are known as ‘superluminous’ supernovae, and are up to 100 times brighter than other types of stellar blasts. They happened only 1.5billion years after the Big Bang which occurred 14billion years ago and their detection could eventually lead to finding the first stars that detonated.

A supernova begins when a star burns out the last of its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity and blasts its outer layers into space. The star’s core is left behind in the condensed form of a neutron star or black hole. Superluminous supernovae were discovered only a few years ago and are rare in the nearby Universe. Some are believed to occur when enormous stars undergo a nuclear explosion caused by light particles converting into electron-positron pairs - beams of matter and anti-matter heading in opposite directions. Such events probably happened more often in the early universe when massive stars were more common. This and their extreme brightness encouraged Dr Jeff Cooke and colleagues to search for superluminous supernovae when the Universe was less than four billion years old. Using images from the giant Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) the researchers calculated superluminous supernovae were at least ten times more common then than now. Dr Cooke, of Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, said: 'Here we report the detection of two superluminous supernovae that have slowly evolving light curves. 'The extreme luminosities of superluminous supernovae provide a way of investigating the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang. 'The detection presents the possibility of finding the explosions of the first stars to form after the Big Bang.'","The cataclysmic death blasts occurred just 1.5bn years after the Big Bang .

Barack Obama has cancelled a campaign event in Florida in order to return to Washington and oversee the response to Hurricane Sandy. Mitt Romney has followed suit, pulling out of all campaigning on Monday evening and throughout Tuesday, along with his running mate Paul Ryan. The President had been due to appear alongside Bill Clinton in Orlando this morning, but will instead take a lead in monitoring conditions on the East Coast as it is battered by the deadly storm. He has also cancelled a planned appearance in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Tuesday, indicating officials believe the damage will continue throughout the week. Scroll down for video . Into the storm: Barack Obama landed at the wet and windy Andrews Air Force base in Maryland on Monday . Braving the elements: The President plans to take charge of the national response to Hurricane Sandy . 'Due to deteriorating weather . conditions in the Washington area, the President will not attend today's . campaign event in Orlando,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a . statement. 'The President will return to the White House to monitor the preparations for and early response to Hurricane Sandy.' Obama arrived in Florida on Sunday night, coming early to try to beat the storm. He was planning to appear with Clinton at the University of Central Florida, then move on to Ohio and northern Virginia. Romney . intended to press on with campaign speeches in Ohio and Iowa today, but . announced he would cancel events planned for Monday evening and . Tuesday. Ryan has also cancelled plans to campaign in the same time frame, according to Republican officials. Refuge: The President was soaked as he landed on the White House lawn after returning from Florida . Caution: Obama warned the public to remain alert during a press conference in the White House . The President held a brief press conference in the White House at lunchtime today, warning the public to pay attention to official warnings and praising the work of first responders who would be 'working 24/7 around the clock nonstop'. 'Don't pause, don't question the instructions you are given,' he said, adding that those who disobeyed the instructions of authorities would be 'putting first responders in danger'. Despite the ravages of the 'big and powerful storm', Obama predicted that the nation would survive the disaster unscathed: 'We will clean up and we will get through this.' He dismissed a reporter's question about how the hurricane will affect the election, saying: 'I'm not worried about the impact on the election... the election will take care of itself of itself next week.' At a campaign event in Iowa, Michelle Obama said of her husband: 'He has made this storm his priority, and he is going to do whatever it . takes to make sure the American people are safe and secure.' Still going: Joe Biden and Bill Clinton landed in Ohio on Monday for a joint campaign event . Shutting down: Mitt Romney announced that he would stop campaigning on Monday evening . Instead of campaigning with the President, Clinton headed to Connecticut to appear on behalf of congressman Chris Murphy, who is locked in a fierce battle for the state's vacant Senate seat. He made reference to the hurricane, saying, 'We're coming down to the 11th hour. We're facing a violent storm.' But Clinton then added: 'It's nothing compared to the storm we'll face if you don't make the right decision in this election.' After the event in Waterbury, he flew with Vice President Joe Biden to Ohio, where the pair will make speeches to supporters in Youngstown. Heading home: Barack Obama boarded Air Force One in Orlando this morning on his way back to Washington . Crisis: The President visited FEMA headquarters on Monday to assess the hurricane threat . Obama said yesterday that the heavily populated East Coast could face power failures and other disruptions for several days. 'Don't anticipate that just because the immediate storm has passed that we're not going to have some potential problems in a lot of these communities going forward through the week,' Obama said after a visit to the federal government's storm-response centre. Romney re-routed his campaign from Virginia to join his vice-presidential running mate Paul Ryan in Ohio, one of the handful of battleground states that will decide the outcome of the November 6 election. 'You are the battleground of battlegrounds. You get to decide,' Ryan told a crowd of 1,000 people who were not able to join 2,000 others in a high school gymnasium in Celina, Ohio. Both campaigns canceled events in New Hampshire, which could face high winds and heavy rain. 'The last thing the President and I . want to do is get in the way of anything.

Drumming up support: Romney re-routed his campaign from Virginia to Ohio in the final days on the campaign trail . Officials in the path . of the storm scrambled to ensure that extended power outages would not . disrupt the early voting that appears to be critical for both candidates . this year. Obama said he did not think the storm would impact voting, but some on his campaign staff were not so certain. 'Obviously we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people that come out, the better we'll do,' top Obama adviser David Axelrod said on CNN. Republican Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell said his state plans to extend early voting hours and restore power quickly to election facilities in the event of outages. Officials in neighboring Maryland said early voting stations would close on Monday. The looming storm threw another note of uncertainty into a race that remains a statistical dead heat. Delight: President Obama fist bumps ten-year-old Treyonce Robinson, during a surprise visit to the 'Obama For America' field office in Orlando, Florida on Sunday night . Special delivery: Obama surprises campaign volunteers in Orlando with a stack of pizzas during an unannounced visit . The vast majority of voters have made up their minds at this point, and more than one in five have already cast their ballots. But the storm could throw a wrench in the campaigns' efforts to drive voters to the polls in the final days before the election and will require them to ensure that their armies of door-knocking volunteers stay safe. An extended power outage could sideline millions of dollars worth of television advertising that is set to saturate the airwaves in the final days of the race. It also scrambles their efforts to schedule rallies in the handful of states that are likely to decide the outcome. 'The poll numbers aren't changing . that much and I don't think the storm is going to change that dynamic. It's just going to present logistical challenges for the campaign,' Hunter College political science professor Jamie Chandler said. Storm brewing: Ocean water rolls over a state highway in North Carolina as Hurricane Sandy continued north . Looming: Hurricane Sandy pictured on a Nasa satellite image as it creeps up the East Coast . A . severe disruption could hurt Obama more than Romney because his . campaign has counted on early voting to lock up the support of those who . may be less likely to vote on Election Day, Chandler said. Officials . from both campaigns said they were confident they would be able to get . their message out and drive voters to the polls over the coming days. But they recognized that, after years of obsessive planning and nearly . $2billion in campaign expenditures, the storm had introduced a . last-minute element of chaos. 'There's . certain things we can't control and nature is one of them. We try to . focus on the things that we can control,' Romney adviser Kevin Madden . told reporters. There is . some evidence that natural disasters can hurt an incumbent's re-election . chances as voters often blame whoever is in office for adversity. Research by Larry Bartels of . Vanderbilt University and Christopher Achen of Princeton University . found that Vice President Al Gore may have lost the election in 2000 . because of severe drought and excessive rainfall in seven states. Bush's . approval ratings plummeted after Hurricane Katrina devastated New . Orleans in 2005, and voters could similarly blame Obama if the . government fumbles its response to this storm. Woops! Obama reacts after realizing he dialed the wrong number while making calls from a local campaign field office in Florida . Obama sits with FEMA Administrator William Craig Fugate (right) for a briefing about Hurricane Sandy . But there are also dangers for Romney, who will have to be careful to avoid being seen as politicising the disaster. His campaign's hasty response to the attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in the Middle East in September was widely criticized. The Obama campaign said it would suspend fundraising e-mails in the mid-Atlantic region on Monday and encouraged supporters to donate to the Red Cross. Opinion polls show the race to be essentially tied at the national level. A Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Sunday found Obama leading Romney among likely voters by 49 percent to 46 percent, within the online survey's credibility interval. Among all registered voters, Obama held a wider lead of 51 per cent to 39 per cent. However, Obama retains a slim advantage in many of the battleground states that will decide the election. A Washington Post poll released on Sunday found Obama leading Romney by 51 per cent to 47 per cent in Virginia, just outside the poll's margin of error. In Ohio, a poll by a group of newspapers found the two tied at 49 per cent each. Other polls have shown Obama ahead there. Romney received the endorsement of Iowa's largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register, which has not backed a Republican since 1972. He also won the endorsement of newspapers in Richmond and Cincinnati. Obama won the endorsement of newspapers in Miami, Detroit and Toledo, Ohio, as well as The New York Times.

The Vibrative Virtual Keyboard uses the iPhone 4's built-in accelerometer to read the vibrations as fingers tap a surface to work out which 'key' is being pressed. By analysing the strength and frequency of tremors through the surface the phone is resting on, the software works out the approximate location of the strike on a virtual QWERTY keyboard. Scroll down to see it in action . Good vibes: A student at Goldsmiths has developed an iPhone app which uses the gadget's built-in accelerometer to interpret taps on a tabletop as strikes on a full-size keyboard . The app has been developed by Swiss designer Florian Kräutli for his one-year cognitive computing master's degree at Goldsmiths, University of London. 'Touch screen devices, such as smartphones, lack a suitable method for text input which can compete with mechanical keyboards,' Mr Kräutli said. 'The Vibrative Virtual Keyboard aims to appease the frustration felt by smartphone users when faced with drafting lengthy emails or notes on a small onscreen keyboard. 'The keyboard requires no additional hardware as it taps into an iPhone's built-in accelerometer, which is able to measure the vibrations caused by typing on any hard surface.' A French entrepreneur is marketing carved wooden keyboards created from maple and walnut trees from the Alps. Mixing one of man's oldest materials with modern technology, each keyboard is wireless, using Bluetooth to connect to PCs and tablets. Julien Salanave said his work is an attempt to stop the 'impersonal, lifeless aesthetic' that came in with the computer. The software needs to be trained to interpret the tremors typing fingers produce on the particular surface used. After collecting examples of all the keys on the keyboard, it compares new data to this training data to roughly work out which key have been pressed. So far Mr Kräutli has been able to reach an 80 per cent accuracy using the system, so errors occur the software will 'assume' what the user intended to write using an auto-correct dictionary. Mr Kräutli, who created the system as part of studies into user interfaces, told the Telegraph: 'The signals I’m collecting are very weak. 'At the moment it’s more of a proof of concept but if you made the accelerometer more sensitive you could improve the accuracy quite easily.' The technology has been designed for iPhone 4, but Mr Kräutli was forced to use a 'jailbroken' device as Apple does not allow apps to change the way that its iOS keyboard works. He says the software could easily be developed for other operating systems or devices which use accelerometers, however. Demonstrating the technology in a video, Mr Kräutli uses a piece of paper printed with an image of a keyboard to train the software and then type out a text message. Showing how it could be used by a touch-typist, he then takes away the paper and continues to type directly on the wooden surface.","Vibrative Virtual Keyboard invented by Swiss designer for his MA project .

Reclining on his bed with an arrogant snarl, new pictures show paedophile Jimmy Savile lounging in his caravan where he may have abused a number of his victims. They emerged as it was revealed Scotland Yard investigated the pervert for molesting a young girl in a mobile home at BBC Television Centre up to 30 years ago. But they failed to act and merely warned him to stay away from children rather than take the chance to arrest him for his sick crimes. Lair: Savile looks relaxed on the bed in a feature on his motor home as more and more allegations of his abuse came out today . Black and white: Picture of Saville's Dodge 'Hustler' released on the day a woman accused him of attacking her in his caravan at BBC Television Centre . Creepy photographs show the child . abuser on his bed, while another shows its inside, where he . may have sexually assaulted or raped victims. Its front is emblazoned with the word . 'hustler' - the name of the Dodge vehicle. Another, taken for a day in the life documentary, shows inside the caravan and Savile staring at people out of its window. The . Jim’ll Fix It star faced questions in the 1980s after the child claimed . she was indecently assaulted in his caravan, which he had parked . outside the BBC’s headquarters. The allegation came to light after a retired officer from the Met’s juvenile bureau at Hammersmith and Fulham police station came forward. He said there had not been enough evidence to prosecute Savile. It is one of the earliest known full police inquiries into the entertainer and took place at the height of his abuse. It means police missed at least seven chances to expose Savile’s crimes during his lifetime. Watching the world go by: The dead disgraced broadcaster stares out of the window in the feature: 'A day in the life of Jimmy Savile' Modern: The inside of the Dodge 'Hustler' would have been very luxurious at the time, but it is also likely Savile used it to carry out his disgusting sexual abuse . Officers in forces including the Met, Surrey and Sussex investigated his activities but the claims were never made public. And it raises fresh questions about what the BBC knew about his sordid activities and whether there was a cover-up. Details of the investigation emerged as the man in charge of Scotland Yard’s investigation said it marks a ‘watershed’ in tackling child abuse. Commander Peter Spindler said 300 people have now claimed to be victims of the TV presenter and others in his circle, while the size of the team responsible for the investigation has been trebled to 30. Paedophile: Jimmy Savile, pictured a few days before his death in October last year . The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Agency has been asked to examine whether anyone named by victims is still working with children. These could include BBC staff and even doctors from some of the hospitals where Savile abused patients under the guise of charity. Mr Spindler said: ‘While Britain reflects on how Savile was able to hide in plain sight, I think it’s quite important that we focus on what’s happening today in our society. 'Our activities in the coming weeks will be a stark warning to any men out there today who think they can exploit their positions of power and influence and abuse children and young people in Britain. ‘I want them to take heed and tell them that we will  come for them. You may  believe you will get away with your crimes. 'But one day – it might not be this decade – we will come and get justice for those victims. Victims may not want to speak straight away, but when they are ready, we will be listening.’ Scotland Yard’s inquiry, Operation Yewtree, is moving into a new and more secretive phase as detectives prepare to arrest surviving suspects. The Met has also discovered a second complaint made in 2003 by a woman who said she had been abused in the 1970s, he revealed. Mr Spindler added: ‘She did not want a prosecution but wanted us to know what happened in case there was a pattern of offending.’ Allegation: Savile faced questions in the 1980s after a girl claimed she was sexually assaulted in his caravan, which he had parked outside the BBC's headquarters (above) VIDEO: Jimmy Savile denies allegations in an interview - SIX years ago...","Police missed seven chances to expose Savile's crimes during his lifetime .

More than 150,000 people took part in the demonstration in London, which heard calls for a general strike. Mr Miliband accused the Prime Minister of 'clinging' to policies which were not working. He said the coalition was cutting taxes for millionaires and raising them for everyone else. Labour leader Ed Miliband speaks on stage at Hyde Park, during the TUC organised protest against austerity measures in London . The Labour leader accused the Prime Minister of 'clinging' to policies which were not working . Hundreds of thousands of angry workers descended on the capital . He said: 'It is one rule for those at the top and one rule for everyone else.' The protesters carried banners which . read: 'Cameron Has Butchered Britain', '24 Hour General Strike Now' and .

Others waved banners saying: 'Plebs of the World Unite', in reference to the scandal which led to MP Andrew Mitchell's resignation yesterday. They booed at Downing Street and shouted 'pay your taxes' as they passed a Starbucks coffee shop. Police officers stood outside Starbucks, which has been involved in a row over its tax arrangements. Some of the marchers shouted 'no first class tickets here' in reference to the incident involving the Chancellor. Mr Miliband was booed by a small section of a rally in Hyde Park when he said Labour would have to make 'hard choices' if it was in Government. Nurses, cleaners, librarians and ambulance drivers joined the march across London . The protest is against the government's austerity policies and calls for an alternative economic strategy that puts jobs and growth first . He pledged that if he became Prime Minister he would tax bankers' bonuses, support the building of 100,000 houses and end the privatisation of the NHS. Bob Crow, leader of the RMT rail union was loudly cheered when he called for a 24-hour general strike. He also called on Mr Miliband to oppose all spending cuts. Nick Chaffey, 48, a Socialist Party campaigner married to a teacher who has taken a pay cut, said: 'If the working class strike for a day, we'll see who runs this country.' 'I've got friends who are in desperate straits, living in fear of losing their job and their house.'

A teenager has beaten an aggressive form of cancer after doctors gave her radioactive medication. Paris Tompkins, from Leicester, was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer after finding a lump in her neck. The thyroid gland is found in the neck and sets the rate at which the body produces energy. Radioactive: Paris Tompkins was diagnosed with thyroid cancer after finding two lumps in her neck. She took radioactive tablets to cure any remaining cancer cells remaining after surgery . Paris, who has a twin sister Paige, first realised something was wrong in February 2010. She said: ‘When I first felt it, it was about the size of a ping-pong ball but it didn’t hurt. ‘I went to my GP and was told to come back in six months if it hadn’t changed. ‘All the blood tests I had came back normal.’ But within six weeks the lump had become little bigger and Paris knew something wasn’t right. She also developed a sore throat. She saw a different GP at her practice and was referred to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where she was eventually diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. This is the most common type of thyroid cancer; women and young people are most often affected. Paris said: ‘It was a complete shock. I had expected the test to be normal and that I would be given some tablets. ‘No-one had brought up the word cancer and then, all of a sudden, I needed to meet an oncologist.’ In August 2010, she had surgery to remove her thyroid and doctors discovered there were actually two tumours. To kill off any cancer cells that might have been left, she was given two courses of radioactive iodine tablets. Early diagnosis: Paris has spoken of her experience to raise awareness of teenage cancer. Her twin sister Paige, right, now also has yearly scans to check for the condition . ‘It effectively made me radioactive,’ said the 17-year-old, who has shared her story as part of Teenage Cancer Week, which aims to help young people know more about the signs and symptoms of cancer. ‘I had to be in a room by myself for a week in hospital and then a further three weeks in isolation at home. ‘I had to use a different bathroom to everyone else and people couldn’t sit next to me because of the radioactivity, but I was just glad I was able to have the treatment.’ While she is slowly getting better, Paris’s twin sister has to have annual scans to make sure she is not developing the same cancer. Paris added: ‘I really didn’t know anything about cancer before this all happened and I want to help get more people aware of it. ‘Early detection is important to survival, which is another reason that awareness is so important.’ Radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment to help find and kill any cancer cells that have spread. The treatment takes place in hospital and is usually given as a drink or . capsule. The radioactive iodine circulates throughout the body in your . bloodstream. Thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are . in your body. The radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells. Other body cells aren’t affected because only thyroid cells take up the iodine. Patients must be kept in isolation as they will be slightly radioactive . for a few days; even sweat and urine will be radioactive during this . time.","Paris Tompkins found a lump the size of a ping-pong ball .

Victoria Pendleton rode tearfully into the sunset last night with her dream of a golden goodbye indelibly tainted by a final clash with her biggest rival. The Olympic sensation added a silver medal to her 2012 and 2008 golds in front of a rousing crowd at the Velodrome – then began her retirement without wearing the crown of the most highly decorated woman athlete of all time. She failed to trounce her Australian arch enemy Anna Meares – a win that would finally have laid to rest the controversy, competition and cat-fighting between them. Victoria was disqualified in the first of three finals with Meares after making contact in the final sprint to the finish, a decision that filled the arena with booing and countless faces frozen in disbelief. She appeared to mouth ‘she touched me first!’ as the judges huddled around screens and played the photo finish over and over again. Then – clearly shaken by the referee’s decision to relegate her – she was beaten to gold in the next race by a powerhouse performance from the 28-year-old Australian. But here’s the good news. Marketing experts said Pendleton could now earn £1million a year with deals promoting lifestyle, fashion and make-up, as well as earning up to £20,000 a time on the corporate speaking circuit. And her silver success yesterday – combined with another gold each for Sir Chris Hoy and 20-year-old Laura Trott – also dramatically bolstered Team GB’s ever growing medal tally. Whatever the result, the crowd still adored Vicky, Vicky, Vicky! This was Last Night of the Velodrome, a Land of Hope and Glory for the people and one last hurrah for Queen Victoria. Despite the disappointment, spectators gave a rousing, raucous send-off for the highest-profile female cyclist of all time before she effectively handed over the challenge to Laura. Holding her medal aloft, she waved farewell at precisely 6.40pm with the newcomer looking on. The Queen had stepped down. Long live the Queen. Her appearance here in the last of the cycling events at the Games will still go down as one of the most exciting finishes to an Olympic race – and to a glittering career – ever witnessed. Every lap Victoria completed on the wooden track brought the crowd alive in an arena that is also known as the Thunderdome. Every section she passed cranked the noise up like a bullet breaking the sound barrier. Pendleton failed to trounce her Australian arch enemy Anna Meares - a win that would finally have laid to rest the controversy, competition and cat-fighting between them . It came not just from the 6,000-strong crowd or from her fiancé, family, or the impressive scattering of royal and VIP onlookers who clearly decided this was the one to watch. Safe to assume it also came from the British ranks of an enormous TV audience around the world, and from a nation that has followed the 31-year-old poster girl and magazine pin-up from the moment she took the 2008 Games by storm. At one stage the cameras caught princes William and Harry leaping to their feet and bellowing.But oh, how much more satisfying for Britain it would have been if the outcome had been that little bit different.

Today a jury cleared him of sex assault . A Cathedral verger who was accused of groping a woman as she waited for a service to start  said yesterday that he was gay and ‘had no reason to touch her’. Former school housemaster  Nicholas Whitaker, 34, told a court that he was not interested in women ‘in the  slightest’. His defence clearly worked because the jury of eight women and four men at Leeds Crown Court took less than 30 minutes to find him not guilty of sexual assault. Mr Whitaker was alleged to have approached the middle-aged woman from behind as she spoke to the head verger at Wakefield Cathedral. The prosecution claimed he had put his arms around her and groped her breasts for up to a minute. Yesterday the former music teacher said that it wasn’t impossible that he touched the woman’s breasts as he hugged her, but it was ‘certainly unintentional’ on his part. He added that the hug would have lasted ‘at max two seconds, literally the time to say good morning’.Mr Whitaker, who lives with his parents in Wakefield, said: ‘I would have no reason to touch her breasts, no wish to touch her breasts. ‘It’s not impossible that as I reached round that some part of my hands or lower arms did come in to contact with her breasts, but it was certainly unintentional on my part.’ Speaking about the incident last year, he said: ‘I thought it would be a fun idea to give her a brief hug from behind and say hello.’ He added that his hands were never open but were closed fists.The court heard that Mr Whitaker had been at the cathedral to sing in the choir on July 2 last year. He had seen the woman, who was known to him, talking to another verger and it is then that he was alleged to have come from behind and groped her. Claims: The incident happened at Wakefield Cathedral before a service. Mr Whitaker maintained he did not intend to grope the woman and was today swiftly acquitted . Mr Whitaker said he didn’t know anything . about the complaint until two weeks later, when he was called into his . superior’s office and informed he was being suspended after an . allegation of sexual harassment and was asked to leave the premises . immediately. He told the court he was ‘stunned’ and ‘mortified’. Giving evidence on Thursday, the woman, who cannot be named for legal . reasons, claimed: ‘He grabbed hold of both of my breasts and groped and . felt and squeezed. ‘It was awful. I just couldn’t move. I felt like a scarecrow because I . couldn’t move my arms. He came up behind me like a shadow.’ Speaking from behind a screen, she added: ‘It wouldn’t have made a . difference if it was a man, a woman or an alien touching my breasts, I . would have still felt the same way.’ The woman went on holiday  the day after the alleged incident, reporting it to the police more than two weeks later.","Woman said she felt 'sick' after being 'groped'

Next time you get your debit card out, you might want to use it to buy some hand wash. A study has found that nearly one in 10 bank cards contains faecal matter. Cash is little better with one in seven bank notes containing high levels of bacteria similar to that found in a dirty toilet bowl. The research, carried out at Queen Mary, University of London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, showed our hands are therefore dirtier than we might think. More than a quarter (26 per cent) of hands sampled showed traces of faecal contamination including bacteria such as E.coli, the study found. And we may be making ourselves ill as a result. A further survey of the 272 participants revealed only 39 per cent washed their hands before eating. The vast majority (91 per cent) of respondents also stated that they washed their hands after using the toilet, although the levels of faecal organisms contaminating the cards and currency suggested otherwise, researchers said. Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhoeal infections by up to 42 per cent but only 69 per cent of people reported doing this whenever possible. Dr Ron Cutler, who led the research at Queen Mary, said: 'Our analysis revealed that by handling cards and money each day we are coming into contact with some potential pathogens revealing faecal contamination including E. coli and Staphylococci. 'People may tell us they wash their hands but the research shows us different, and highlights just how easily transferable these pathogens are, surviving on our money and cards.' Scroll down for video . Only 39 per cent of participants said they washed their hands before eating . Dr Val Curtis, from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'Our research shows just how important handwashing is - the surprising levels of contamination that we found on everyday objects is a sign that people are forgetting to wash their hands after the toilet, one of the key moments for infection prevention.' Nick Wilcher, marketing manager of Radox, who funded the study to raise awareness of Global Handwashing Day, said: 'Our research highlights just how much bacteria we are exposed to in our everyday lives, on objects such as money and cards. 'We hope this study makes people think twice and encourages people to wash their hands after going to the toilet and before eating.' Samples were taken from 272 people from east and west London, Birmingham and Liverpool - and in total 816 specimens were collected.

New Jersey politician Pat Delany, 42, stepped down from the state assembly this month because of the ‘offensive’ email, a GOP official said. It was sent by Jennifer Delany to the state Senate campaign team of political novice Mr Lewis, 50, who is a nine-time Olympic gold medallist. Resignation: Pat Delany stepped down from the New Jersey state assembly this month after his wife sent a 'racist' email to the campaign team of Carl Lewis . Mr Delany had originally cited an unspecified family issue as the reason for his abrupt resignation earlier this month. But Burlington County Republican Chairman Bill Layton revealed it was because he wanted to save his children from embarrassment. The email said in part: ‘Imagine having dark skin and name recognition and the nerve to think that equalled knowing something about politics.’ Mr Layton said the father-of-three decided to leave office to shield his children from ‘a hurtful and embarrassing public spectacle’. He described her email, which was in response to a routine mailing from Mr Lewis’s campaign, as ‘inexplicable’ and ‘inexcusable’. Mr Delany put forward his ‘sincere apologies’ to Mr Lewis on behalf of his family but said he does not share the same racial views as his wife. Jennifer Delany: Her husband decided to leave office to shield his children from 'a hurtful and embarrassing public spectacle involving their mother' Mr Delany holds a physics degree from Rutgers University and served in the U.S. Navy for eight years, the New Jersey Legislature website says. He was in the job for less than eight months and his wife was a Burlington County committeewoman at the time of the email, reported NJ.com. Mr Lewis is running for state Senate in a New Jersey Legislative District. Mr Delany was part of the opposing GOP Assembly slate in the district. The ex-athlete and Republicans have been . fighting over whether he meets the state's four-year residency . requirement for state Senate candidates. He grew up in Willingboro, a . middle-class town between Philadelphia and Trenton, but recently has . lived in California, where he owns a home. ‘Imagine having dark skin and name recognition and the nerve to think that equalled knowing something about politics' Email from Jennifer Delany to Carl Lewis's campaign team . He went to Texas for college and in 1984 moved from track star to celebrity when he won four gold medals at the Los Angeles Olympics. Over the next 12 years, he would collect five more golds at the Olympics. New Jersey's top elections official, Republican Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, ruled Mr Lewis ineligible to run for office this spring.

'Former Assemblyman Pat Delany's wife inexplicably sent an offensive and racist email in response to a routine email from Carl Lewis's campaign. Her actions were inexcusable' Burlington County Republican Chairman Bill Layton . Mr Lewis, who is among the greatest athletes of all time, challenged the ruling in federal and state courts. A federal appeals court allowed his name to appear on June primary ballots, and he won his party's nomination with 2,418 votes in an uncontested race. Republican Senator Dawn Addiego won her uncontested party primary with 4,350 votes, and the two would face off in November - if the courts allow. Mr Lewis contends he moved back to New Jersey in 2005, when he bought homes for himself and his mother. Champion: Carl Lewis won four gold medals at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 - and over the next 12 years collected five more golds at the Olympics . He has been a volunteer high school track coach since 2007 and has had a valid New Jersey driver's licence since 2006.

Riding on the wave of a serendipitous chart-topping single of Nick Clegg's apology for raising tuition fees, the Liberal Democrats are now selling memorabilia mugs saying 'I'm sorry'. On the official opening day of the Lib Dem conference, in Brighton, the party embraced the spoof remix of leader Nick Clegg's youtube apology, selling mugs branded with his face and what has become the catchy line to the song's chorus. The party leader's videoed apology went viral after satirical website The Poke quickly released a remix of what some feared would be a failed attempt to garner party support. Mugs depicting Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg with the words 'I'm Sorry' on at the Liberal Democrat Annual Conference in Brighton . Opposition to Clegg's tuition fees apology were concerned the video would remind Lib Dem supporters of the party's broken promise, just as it had subsided in their memories. However, the popularity of the catchy 'Autotune remix' has resulted in the sort of sort of publicity that money simply cannot buy. Seizing upon its popularity, the party has wasted no time in creating memorabilia to build on the song's success. After a year in which Lib Dem support has continued to decline, the party is likely to pounce on any opportunity to attract further interest. Will there be T-shirts, caps and key-rings branding Clegg's now infamous chorus: 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, the Liberal Democrats are sorry..' ? The mugs proved popular with party members who arrived in Brighton this weekend for the start of the Liberal Democrats' annual conference . The party's annual conference, which gets going on Sunday, has already attracted media attention after officers were spotted seizing cycles from the seafront as part of a precautionary measure to prevent terrorists from planting so-called bike bombs. The cycles were removed from bike racks just 100 yards from the Brighton Centre where Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will address the conference next week. The Lib Dem leader and other high-ranking ministers are staying at the Grand Hotel, next to the Brighton Centre. Security is tight as the spectre of the 1984 Brighton bombing, where IRA terrorists attempted to kill then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the Grand Hotel, still looms large. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will try to bolster support for his party this coming week after a year of declining support .

A suicide bomber driving a motorcycle packed with explosives rammed his bike into a patrol of Afghan and international forces on Monday morning in eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 14 people, including three NATO service members and their translator, officials said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, which came as relations between international forces and their Afghan partners have been pushed to the breaking point by a surge in insider attacks by Afghan allies. The attack comes as top Afghanistan official General John Allen blasted the rash of insider attacks, saying he was 'mad as hell' that terrorist forces were taking advantage of the United States' 'vulnerabilities' during the troop withdrawal and warned that the insider attack would be the 'signature' of the current stage. Scroll down for video . Blast: Afghan police inspect the site of a suicide bomb attack targeting a convoy of NATO's soldiers of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), in Khost, Afghanistan, 01 October 2012 . The bomber struck a group of Afghan police and international troops shortly after they got out of their vehicles to walk through a market area in Khost city, the capital of Khost province, said provincial government spokesman Baryalai Wakman. Six civilians and four police officers were killed in the blast, Wakman said. He said the police officers were part of a specialized quick-reaction force. Blood could be seen on the market road as Afghan police and soldiers tried to clean up the area after the blast. Slippers and bicycle parts were strewn about. 'I heard the explosion and came right to this area. I saw the dead bodies of policemen and of civilians right here,' said policeman Hashmat Khan, who ran to the site of the blast from his job as security for a nearby bank. Coalition spokesman Maj. Adam Wojack would only confirm that three NATO service members and their translator died in a bombing in the east on Monday, without giving an exact location or the nationalities of the dead. The international military alliance usually waits for individual nations to announce details on deaths.

Most of the troops in the east and in Khost province are American. It was not immediately clear if the translator was an Afghan citizen or a foreigner, Wojack said. Dozens of Afghan civilians were also wounded in the bombing. The city's hospital alone was treating about 30 people injured in the explosion, said Dr. Amir Pacha, a physician working there. He added there could be other victims being treated at nearby private clinics. 'In Iraq, the signature weapon . system that we hadn't seen before was the IED. We had to adjust to . that.

"By . Thomas Durante, Reuters Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:25 EST, 25 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:37 EST, 25 August 2012 . Cover: The Dutton publishing company announced on Wednesday that No Easy Day will be published on September 11 . The former Navy SEAL who authored a soon-to-be-published book about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden is now facing death threats in addition to possible criminal prosecution. An official al Qaeda website on Friday posted a photograph and the name of the former Navy commando responsible for the book, calling him 'the dog who murdered the martyr Sheikh Osama bin Laden.' Meanwhile the head of U.S. Special Operations Command told current and former troops that the military would take legal action against anyone found to have exposed sensitive information that could cause harm to fellow forces. 'We will pursue every option available to hold members accountable, including criminal prosecution where appropriate,' Admiral Bill McRaven wrote in an open, unclassified letter emailed to the active-duty special operations community. 'As current or former members of our special operations community, authors have a moral obligation, and a legal duty, to submit their works for pre-publication security review,' the admiral wrote. The book's publisher announced on Wednesday that 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' would tell the real story about the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011. The book, to be published under the pseudonym 'Mark Owen,' is scheduled to be released on September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC. But the former serviceman's attempts to remain anonymous were foiled on Thursday, when FoxNews.com identified him as Matt Bissonnette, 36, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, who retired shortly after the bin Laden mission. By early on Friday, the man's name, photograph and age had been posted on the 'the Al-Fidaa Islamic Network' online forum, one of two websites officially endorsed by al Qaeda, according to Evan Kohlmann, founder of the New York-based security firm Flashpoint Global Partners. It was followed by comments that called for the man's death, including one response that said, 'O' Allah, kill every one of them,' and another that said, 'O' Allah, make an example of him for the whole world and give him dark days ahead.' Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday. MailOnline has decided to blur the image so as not to show the soldier's face; he is now facing death threats from al Qaeda in addition to possible criminal prosecution . Publisher Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group, asked news organizations on Thursday to withhold his name. But that didn’t stop the Associated . Press, which later confirmed the the FoxNews.com report through their . own sources, and circulated the information through its subscribers. The revelation had alarm bells ringing in military circles. Pentagon spokesman Lt Col James . Gregory told MailOnline that the release of a former special ops . soldier’s identity can be worrisome. He said: ‘We protect the names of our special ops personnel for security reasons. Any time names are revealed, it’s a concern.' Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus of . U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before . Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and . former troops from spilling military matters and national security . issues. Other departments, including the CIA, . the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White . House, were also caught off-guard. That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book. Lt Col Gregory said that since he is . now a private citizen, the military could refer the investigation to the . Department of Justice. McRaven's open letter to the . active-duty special operations community said books and films about . special operations teams could be useful educational tools, and the . military would work with potential authors, but current and former . service members would be held accountable if they endangered the safety . of U.S. forces. He said there was 'a distinct line . between recounting a story for the purposes of education or . entertainment and telling a story that exposes sensitive activities just . to garner greater readership and personal profit.' Kohlmann said the former Navy SEAL . could now be in physical danger from al Qaeda sympathizers seeking . revenge for bin Laden's death, or hoping to gain prestige for . themselves. 'They have a photo of the individual, . they have his name, his age,' Kohlmann said. 'I wish that all this was . bluster, but there are a lot of would-be jihadists out there, including . some in North America. This is the ideal opportunity for those kind of . people.' In the dark: The Pentagon said that it has not seen a copy of the book, despite regulations designed to keep former and current military personnel from spilling military secrets . The book's publisher, Dutton, said . the author was 'one of the first men through the door on the third floor . of the terrorist leader's hideout and was present at his death.' It is not known whether 'No Easy Day' contains details of commando operations that the U.S. government . considers secret, but U.S. government officials said the account had not . been submitted for a required pre-publication review. 'Even if there is nothing classified . disclosed, it should have been reviewed, and it was not,' said one . official who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, the publisher said the . book had been vetted 'for tactical, technical, and procedural . information as well as information that could be considered classified . by compilation' by a former 'special operations attorney.' Jeffrey Carr, a cyber security . expert, said al Qaeda officials were adept at using the Internet for . recruitment, training and other searches, and he fully expected them to . target the former Navy SEAL now that his identity had been disclosed. 'He's going to become the poster . child for recruitment and assassination,' Carr said, noting that the . case underscored the need for anyone in a high-risk profession to take . great precautions with any information available on the Internet. Carr said the man's relatives and . former Navy SEAL colleagues could also be in danger if they could be . traced through the Internet. Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan . Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House . Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus . of U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before . Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and . former troops from spilling military matters and national security . issues. Other departments, including the CIA, . the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White . House, were also caught off-guard. That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book. Lt . Col Gregory said that since he is now a private citizen, the military . could refer the investigation to the Department of Justice. But any judicial action would hinge on the content of No Easy Day. 'We . don't know what kind of details [are in the book], so we can't make a . determination over whether it's classified or not,' Lt Col Gregory said. But the publisher maintains that . Bissonnette's writings were properly vetted by a former special . operations attorney, and will not let any military cats out of the bag. Christine Ball, a spokeswoman for the Dutton, the publisher, told Reuters: 'He vetted it for tactical, technical, and procedural information as well as information that could be considered classified by compilation and found it to be without risk to national security.' Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down . No Easy Day is co-authored by journalist Kevin . Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last . year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan. Maurer . spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and . Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer. The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported on Wednesday that the book also goes into detail about Bissonnette's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL. The blog added that the book will . culminate with a 'blow by blow' account of the dramatic raid in the . terror leader's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound.

Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama . Owen's book comes on the heels of . another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed . three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary . Clinton. That explosive allegation is . contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the .

It started as a ‘tussle,’ just a ‘skirmish,’ but at some point, Raul Barrera simply ‘lost it’. ‘You know, I just saw this blood, so much at the time,’ he added. The chilling confession of the man dubbed the Lower East Side girlfriend-butcher was played publicly for the first time at Barrera’s pre-sentencing hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court. The 33-year-old fashion publicist admitted to stabbing his beautiful girlfriend Sarah Coit, 23, some 30 times in her Clinton Street apartment last year. Slain: Raul Barrera left Lacoste sales manager Sarah Coit, pictured, bleeding in her bedroom after a 'skirmish' got 'out of control' Such were the extent of the injuries, that Miss Coit was found disembowelled and her head had almost been removed from her body. The blade of one of the knives used was still embedded in her skull. ‘I don’t know. I lost it,’ Barrera is heard mumbling to a police officer and a prosecutor just five hours after the brutal slaying of the young Lacoste sales manager. Barrera said the pair had begun arguing before the ‘tussle’ began and ‘things got out of control’. He said: ‘Then we started arguing a little bit. Got into a tussle and there was this silver cart thing next to the edge of the kitchen counter and we must have knocked it down and we must have knocked it down and all the cutlery, the knives were in the…they just all fell to the ground and then we fell to the ground. ‘And I was on top of her. Then my hand just got a cut and it was bleeding a lot profusely and I just…things got out of control.’ After stabbing Miss Coit repeatedly, he then admitted to dragging her, as she lay dying, from her living room into her bedroom before flinging his coat on her, according to the New York Post. Rather than calling the emergency services, he phoned his parents, sister and his son to ‘apologise,’ changed out of his blood-soaked clothes and left the New York apartment to hail a cab. Confession: Raul Barrera (centre) admitted to stabbing his girlfriend after they began to 'tussle' following an argument . Brutal: Miss Coit was nearly decapitated and the blade of one of the knives used by Barrera was still in her skull when police found her . All the while his girlfriend lay bleeding out in her bedroom. When asked by the prosecutor whether he thought to call 911, Barrera simply answered: ‘No.’ At no point in the interview did Barrera ask what condition Coit was in, but he did note that her condition was ‘really bad’ at the point of leaving the flat. He was then asked why he did not call an ambulance. ‘I was just afraid, panicked, scared,’ he explained of not calling an ambulance. ‘I just, I didn’t know what to expect.’ Last week Barrera pleaded guilty to Coit’s murder. Manhatten Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers presided over that plea as well as the two-day pre-sentencing hearing that concluded on Monday. Barrera will find out the sentence for his crime on October 29, and is expected to receive anything from 15 years to life in prison. The killer is hoping his mental state and his guilty plea will earn him a lesser sentence. Last week, Miss Coit’s father, Lynde Coit, laid bare  his grief at the loss of his daughter as he testified in court. In an emotional testimony, the millionaire lawyer from Greenwich, said: ‘When I identified Sarah's body in the basement of the morgue, her injuries, the look on her face, the terror, will haunt me for the rest of my life and haunt the rest of her family.' Haunted: Miss Coit's (left) father, Lynde (right), identified the mutilated body of his once-beautiful daughter in the morgue and said the terror in her face will 'haunt me for the rest of my life' Mr Coit described how he had travelled to New York, expecting to share a meal with his daughter at her favourite pizza restaurant, according to The New York Post. He read aloud his final text to his daughter - 'Love you,' which he sent as he set off for the city.But she had already been dead for eight hours and what he saw when he arrived in New York was Miss Coit's once-beautiful face criss-crossed by gashes in the city morgue, her perfect teeth grimacing in pain. Prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Carruthers, who will decide Barrera's fate, that the killer murdered the young marketer with 'breathtaking viciousness.' He also described how neighbours awoke to her screams but heart-wrenchingly couldn't work out where to send police, according to The New York Post. Cold blooded: Barrera left the apartment, with Miss Coit bleeding on her bedroom floor, and hailed a cab to leave the scene . 'There were so many soul-shattering screams that half-a-dozen New Yorkers got out of their beds at 2.30 in the morning,' Bogdanos said. 'These neighbors roamed their hallways, calling, ""Where are you? Where are you?"" Miss Coit was living in a tenement apartment in the lower Manhattan neighbourhood and the proximity of the houses to each other left neighbours thinking her blood-curdling screams were coming from the building next door. As such, Barrera was lacerating the young woman for 35 minutes before police finally knocked on the right apartment, eventually finding her breathing her last breathes in a puddle of blood, with bent and broken knives littering the floor. Prosecutors are expected to ask for the maximum sentence - 25 years to life. But defence attorney Paul Feinman is likely to argue that Barrera deserves a reduced sentence because of mental health issues.","Raul Barrera's taped confession of killing Sarah Coit, 23, details 'skirmish' that 'got out of control'

A 'dangerous' thief who told a policewoman he is HIV positive before stabbing her in the arm with a hypodermic needle has been jailed for almost three years. The incident was the third time Polish shoplifter Grzegorz Pajak, 28, had brandished a hypodermic needle when caught stealing, and the fourth time he had used his HIV status as 'a weapon', a court heard. Pc Gemma Newman - who attended a Boots store where Pajak had been caught shoplifting aftershave - is considering leaving front line policing as a result of 'deep psychological distress' caused by the attack, Gloucester Crown Court was told. 'Dangerous man': Grzegorz Pajak will be deported back to Poland after he has served his jail sentence, Gloucester Crown Court heard . Persistent thief Pajak - who will be deported to Poland once he has served his sentence - also once spat on a police officer who arrested him, and had twice been armed with knives when he went out shoplifting. Pajak pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding Pc Newman on 29 July this year, and to stealing a quantity of aftershave from Boots in Eastgate Street, Gloucester, on the same date. Prosecutor Giles Nelson said the police officer is now living with the fear that she may have been infected with HIV. Pajak jabbed a hypodermic needle into the police officer's arm . She has had tests which have already proved negative for hepatitis C but is still awaiting further test results. Judge Jamie Tabor QC jailed Pajak for 32 months after hearing that - because of the scale and seriousness of his offending in the UK over the last five years - he will be deported by the UK Borders Agency at the end of his term. 'You have caused the officer deep psychological distress by what you did,' the judge told Pajak. 'It has caused further distress in that she has reacted adversely to some of the medication she has been given to counter what you did to her. 'This was the third time you produced a needle when you were caught shoplifting and the fourth time you have used your HIV status as a weapon. 'You have spat on someone on one occasion and on two other occasions prior to that you were armed with a knife. 'You are a dangerous man, of that there is no doubt in my mind at all. 'Since coming to this country you have been perpetually immersed in criminal activity and causing serious inconvenience and worse. The judge added: 'I am very pleased to hear that the UK Borders Agency are going to send you back to your homeland once you have served your sentence.' Pajak lashed out at the police officer after he was caught shoplifting aftershave from Boots in Gloucester . The court heard that Pc Newman was called to the Boots branch after a store detective caught Pajak shoplifting and detained him. The security officer warned that Pajak had a needle. Moments later Pajak said: ‘I’m going to f*****g stab you. I’ve got HIV.' He then lashed out and punctured the officer’s arm with the needle. Pc . Newman said in a statement read out in court that it was the most . frightening incident she had been involved in during her four and a half . year police career. 'This was without question the most frightening incident I have been involved in,' her statement said. 'I had never been confronted with a needle before and I was extremely scared. 'I . have been left questioning whether I want to continue working as a . front line police officer as this incident has affected me so much. 'I am wondering what psychological effect this will have on my both personally and professionally.' Pajak was jailed for 32 months after pleading guilty to unlawful wounding and theft at Gloucester Crown Court . The . court was told that Pajak arrived in the UK between 2005 and 2007, and . that his criminal record in the country dates back to 2007. The prolific shoplifter has been before the courts 27 times. Paul . Cook, defending, said Pajak was ashamed and remorseful about what he . had done to the police officer and had written her a letter five days . after her arrest to assure her that the needle was clean and that she . was not at risk of disease. The root of his client's problem was heroin addiction dating back to 2008, Mr Cook said.","Grzegorz Pajak jabbed a needle into Pc Gemma Newman's arm after being caught stealing at Boots in Gloucester .

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 04:13 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:06 EST, 3 October 2012 . Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson received a £3.2million payout from the production company he started before selling his stake to BBC Worldwide, it has emerged. The BBC's highest paid star then landed up to £15million from the sale of his 30 per cent stake in Bedder 6. The company was a joint project with BBC Worldwide, the corporation’s commercial wing, which has now taken full control of the 50 per cent share that was split between Clarkson and Top Gear producer Andy Wilman. Wheels on fire: Clarkson and his co-stars James May, left, and Richard Hammond have signed up for another three years presenting the popular TV motoring show . Clarkson's share previously furnished the wealthy star with a hefty annual dividend - the most recent coming to £2.7million, up from £1.8m the previous year. He was also paid a talent fee of £456,000, an increase of 30 per cent on his £350,000 fee last year, according to Company House accounts seen by the Daily Telegraph. Lucrative: The firm gave Clarkson a £2.7m dividend last year, on top of his talent fee as one of the BBC's highest paid stars and the money from his books and other ventures . Bedder 6 was set up five years ago with the intention of exploiting the programme’s global brand. Clarkson has just signed a lucrative new deal to continue presenting BBC 2's popular motoring show for three more years alongside James May and Richard Hammond. Top Gear has been one of Worldwide’s . biggest moneyspinners and Bedder 6 has had huge success from merchandise, book and DVD sales, show tours and international sales rights. Clarkson is now likely to be paid a fixed annual £500,000 talent fee by the broadcaster up until 2015. A spokesman for BBC Worldwide said: 'BBC . Worldwide has agreed new commercial deals with Jeremy, James, Richard . and Andy to secure Top Gear’s international future for another three . years. 'This agreement secures the commercial . future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows . us to continue to grow the brand around the world, reinvest in Top Gear . and return profits to the BBC.' Clarkson and Wilman went to the same prestigious private school in Repton, Derbyshire, where they were two years apart, before working together on various TV projects including Top Gear. The name Bedder 6 is believed it is a pun on 'better sex' - a reference to an in-joke about one of the dormitories at Wilman and Clarkson's former school. The often controversial star caused particular outrage when it emerged that he earned £3m in the year to March because of his stake in Bedder 6,which made pre-tax profits of £15.2m and is estimated to be worth more than £50m. He is also a weekly columnist for the Sunday Times and has become a prolific book writer, mainly of best-selling collections of his columns. He is also in demand on the after dinner speaker circuit, where he can command at least £20,000 a time. The 52-year-old lives in the Cotswolds, where he has become a member of 'the Chipping Norton set', and owns a £1.2m lighthouse holiday home in an Isle of Man beauty spot, set in about 40 acres of coastland. However, the 52-year-old told a BBC interviewer in 2009: 'I'm literally not the slightest bit interested in money. I just don't pay any attention to money, it's rather vulgar.' Top Gear's success has a lot to do with Jeremy Clarkson's unique writing and presenting style, but the outspoken 52-year-old has run into plenty of controversy along the way. In November 2008 he made a joke about how tough it is to change gear in a lorry - and linked it to the Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright, who murdered sex workers in Ipswich. Clarkson (pictured right) said: 'Change gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, change gear, change gear, murder. That’s a lot of effort in a day.' In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'. A year later he illustrated dangerous driving conditions with a joke about a woman in a burka wearing a red G-string, which was branded 'distasteful'. Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied, 'I demand the right not to be bummed.' In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints. Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'. The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee this week gave him another slap on the wrist for the scripted remarks, ruling that he had 'strayed into an offensive stereotypical assumption'. Probably his most shocking moment came on The One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families'. Clarkson was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark sparked around 31,700 complaints. He was later cleared.","Received £2.7million from the firm last year .

The SAS has launched a secret  mission to poach the brightest students at Cambridge University from under the noses of MI5 and MI6. Regimental sources revealed last night that the Special Air Service has set up a secret base near the university where officers can assess undergraduates’ potential. At least 20 Cambridge students have already joined the SAS’s training programme this year. Those who pass the punishing regime of endurance marches will receive jungle training before being considered for anti-terrorist and intelligence-gathering operations. Cambridge University remains a key recruitment centre for the Intelligence Services despite its notoriety for producing traitors who passed vital information to the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Last night a former SAS officer said the regiment’s move to challenge MI5 and MI6’s ascendancy at Cambridge was an ‘operational imperative’. He added: ‘We need to bring in clever, really versatile young guys who are mustard-keen. You can achieve so much more with recruits of this high calibre. The talent pool at Cambridge is deep and the Intelligence Services have been fishing in it for years. Now we’re giving the spies a run for their money.’ The SAS’s recruitment programme at Cambridge is subject to strict security measures. Student candidates are forbidden to disclose the address of the regiment’s base and must not tell their friends they have been ‘talent-spotted’. The new recruits are undergoing SAS training on weekends and weekday evenings. They are paid £43 per day, rising to £76 if they are selected. They can complete their academic studies while training. The SAS’s entry course culminates in three weeks of endurance marches on the Brecon Beacons in Wales. Candidates must carry backpacks weighing 50lb over hundreds of miles and navigate their own course using maps and compasses. The SAS unit in Cambridge is called C Squadron and belongs to the Army’s 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve). 'Talent pool': New recruits from the prestigious university are undergoing SAS training during evenings and at weekends . The SAS has historic links with Cambridge University. Its founder, Colonel Sir David Stirling, attended Trinity College before the Second World War. The college was also attended by the quartet of agents believed to have passed top-secret information to the Soviet Union. Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt hid their communist sympathies in order to infiltrate British Intelligence and pass on MI5 documents to their masters in Moscow. The recruitment move by the regiment – whose motto is Who Dares Wins – is a bid to ease a manning crisis. In a letter leaked last year, the Army’s Director of Infantry, Brigadier Richard Dennis, admitted that finding soldiers of sufficient ability to join the SAS was ‘a challenge’. The shortage of ordinary soldiers applying for selection has led the Ministry of Defence to ring-fence the SAS from the Army’s redundancies programme. Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that 8,000 personnel will be told in January they are losing their jobs. The MoD declined to comment.","Special Air Service has a secret base close to the university to assess potential candidates .

A professional footballer kicked a taxi driver in the head and set fire to his cab after taking party drug mephedrone or M-Cat. Non-league player Oliver Edwards, 23, and Adam Wilson, 24, launched a vicious attack on 64-year-old driver Mohammed Sabir during an argument over a fare in Leek, Staffordshire. Mr Sabir was left with severe swelling, . bruising and grazing on his head, face and torso after Edwards and . Wilson repeatedly stamped on him. Violence: Oliver Edwards, left, has been sacked from Leek Town FC after attacking a cab driver along with friend Adam Wilson, right, after they had been drinking in the pub . Brutal behaviour: Edwards, a winger for non-league side Leek Town FC, pictured, was jailed for four-and-a-half years . The pair then stole Mr Sabir’s Mitsubishi Lancer taxi and sped off before dumping the car in a country lane and setting it ablaze. Edwards, a winger for Leek Town FC in Northern Premier League Division One South, was jailed for four-and-a-half . years while Wilson was caged for four years after they admitted robbery . at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday. Sentencing them, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones told the pair: 'This was a most serious offence. 'You set about Mr Sabir in a brutal fashion, kicking and stamping on his head. 'You left him bleeding and semi-conscious in the road and effectively hijacked his taxi. 'You then, quite calculatingly, set fire to it, thinking you would destroy any forensic evidence to link you to the crime.' Drug-fuelled assault: Edwards, who has now been fired from Leek Town FC, had taken M-Cat, or mephedrone . The court heard Edwards, who has convictions for unlawful wounding in 2005 and 2008, had been drinking with his then girlfriend Tiffany Garside, 26, and Wilson at the Quiet Woman pub in Leek on June 6 when they were picked up by Mr Tabir after closing time. They asked to go to a nearby petrol station but when they arrived they argued with Mr Tabir over the fare. David Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'When they arrived there was some kind of dispute. 'The three got out of the taxi and Mr Sabir drove away and parked 100 yards up the road. 'The three passengers entered the petrol station and alcohol was purchased. Mr Sabir had contacted his base and was told to stay there because the police had been called. Closing time: The cab driver picked up the pair along with Edwards's then-girlfriend from the Quiet Woman pub in Leek . 'While he was waiting he noticed the defendants approaching. 'Edwards opened the driver’s door and . pulled the complainant out of the taxi. He was attacked by Edwards and . Wilson while he was on the ground.' Edwards and Garside, both from Leek, then got into the Mitsubishi Lancer cab while Wilson drove it away. Mr Bennett added: 'The complainant was left injured by the side of the road in a semi-conscious state. 'The taxi was only driven a short distance. It was abandoned in a country lane then set on fire. The £100 takings had been taken.' The three were identified from CCTV footage taken at the petrol station and were arrested later that day. Mother-of-one Garside, 26, admitted allowing herself to be carried in a vehicle taken without consent. Nicholas Tatlow, defending, said: 'He [Edwards] had a good educational background, had excellent long-term employment prospects, and is a talented sportsman playing football at semi-professional level. He is appalled by what he has done.' Andrew Molloy, defending Wilson, of Cheddleton, said his client had written a letter of apology Mr Sabir, adding: 'He is utterly ashamed.' Garsidewas given a 12-month community order with 200 hours’ unpaid work. After the attack, Edwards wrote a grovelling apology on his club’s website saying he had made a 'massive mistake.' He has now been sacked from the team.","Oliver Edwards, 23, had been drinking and taking party drug M-Cat .

'And what we're seeing right now in my view is a trick down government approach, which as government thinking it can do things better than free people pursuing their dreams.

A property developer has been given six months to tear down a secret house which she built disguised as a garage. Carol Jones, 46, designed the plush two-storey home, complete with two double bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms and modern kitchen, under the guise of a garage workshop in her back garden. She and her builder husband Andy, 46, erected the 30ft high building in 2006 to live in while they were building their bigger house just yards away. Looks like a garage... but it's a house: Behind the garage doors is a plush two-storey home . The couple only had permission to build a garage and workshop on the plot, but went ahead and built the two-bedroom home instead - fixing a fake double garage door to . the outside in a bid to fool the authorities. But . at the back of the building, they installed a satellite dish, three . skylights on the pitched roof and a kitchen window overlooking rolling . countryside. The case bears similarities to a . couple who disguised their £500,000 home as a hay barn and . lost a four-year legal battle to save it last year. Property developer Alan Beesley and . his wife Sarah, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, had been granted permission to build a barn for . agricultural use – but then fitted it out as a luxury two-storey home. They tried to outwit council planners by disguising their house as a windowless barn and surrounding it with farmyard machinery.

A350 between Upton and Lytchett in Poole shortly after 8.15am after . reports that the bus had overturned into a field. Dorset Police have said that six people involved, including the driver and five students, sustained 'minor injuries'. The First Group bus, registered to Plymouth in Devon, was heading to Kingston Maurward College in Dorchester. The driver lost control of the bus which careered off the 50mph road, ploughed through a hedge and rolled down an embankment before landing on its side. The passengers, all aged between 16 and 18, were flung from their seats as the vehicle overturned. Passing motorists pulled over and helped some of the shocked students out of the wreckage. On hand: Fire and rescue services were on the scene and treated the three passengers and the driver for minor injuries . A fleet of ambulances and fire crews rushed to the scene and the six casualties were treated at the scene. Most of them boarded a replacement bus which took them on to the college. Inspector .

'The Trust committed a number of ambulances to the scene and a total of six casualties have been taken to Poole Hospital. 'None of the casualties is thought to . be in a life-threatening condition. There are also a number of patients . thought to be walking wounded and they were treated by ambulance . clinicians at a location near to where the incident occurred.' No other vehicles were believed to have been involved. Student Jade Elizabeth said: 'I can’t tell you how scared I was. 'It was terrifying. As the bus was tipping I thought it was a dream, but when I got to the ground all covered in glass, I thought, that’s it I’m going to die.' Georgie Davis, 18, an agriculture student from Poole, was at the back of the bus and described it as the worst moment of her life when it suddenly flipped. 'We went flying - people were going everywhere. We were hanging on for dear life. It was absolutely awful. As it turned I went to stand up and a women came flying past me and elbowed me in the ribs.

'I ended up standing on the window with a bush underneath and it started to give way so I grabbed hold of the metal and was holding on for dear life.' She said she saw a passenger with cuts to his hand, another woman was treated by the air ambulance after suffering a panic attack. 'It could have been so much worse.

British Gas and npower have provoked fury today by announcing an inflation-busting rise in energy bills – even though the price of power has fallen over the past year. British Gas today unveiled a dramatic increase of six per cent on gas and electricity prices while npower raised its prices by up to 9.1 per cent. Both will come into effect from next month. This will see a rise in the average bill for customers of around £80. The rise will affect millions of households and plunge more people into fuel poverty just as the winter months set in. Bills, bills, bills: British Gas is hiking rates by six per cent - increasing the average bill to £1,336 . Audrey Gallacher, Director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: ‘Two price hikes on the same day will just reinforce the views and prejudices of consumers – whether justified or not - about a lack of transparency and competitiveness in the market. ‘People are not convinced that they are getting a fair deal. 'Unless they can be reassured about the relationship between costs, prices and profits, consumer distrust will continue, companies won’t get their message across, and the success of the regulator will be questioned. 'Consumers need to see the Government and regulator taking big steps to help mitigate the rising cost of energy for customers.’ Millions of families are already . struggling to pay their energy bills amid the biggest squeeze on . household incomes for more than 60 years. The price rise will lead to renewed . claims that energy giants are profiteering. The firm’s parent company . Centrica has already posted profits of £1.7billion in the first half of . this year. British Gas managing director Phil Bentley defended the company's price increases, . arguing: 'Britain’s North Sea gas supplies are running out, and British . Gas has to pay the going rate for gas in a competitive global . marketplace. 'Furthermore, . the investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to . deliver energy to our customers’ homes, and the costs of the . Government’s policies for a clean, energy-efficient Britain, are all . going up. 'Unfortunately, we cannot run our business sustainably on lower margins and still make the investments in jobs and future energy sources that Britain needs, especially if the country is to grow its way out of recession. ‘Investments in the infrastructure of Britain, in the Grid, is what will keep the lights on.’ But even though the price of buying . electricity on the open market is six per cent lower than it was 12 . months ago, all the big six energy firms are all expected to hike their . prices before Christmas. Four other major gas companies – EDF, E.ON, SSE and Scottish Power – are all expected to increase . rates either before or during winter. SSE is hiking tariffs by nine per cent at the start of next week. Only E.ON has promised not to hike bills until after December 31. Stephen Fitzpatrick, managing director . of small electricity supplier OVO Energy, said industry regulator Ofgem . had failed to get the market working better. 'Out of touch': British Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Caroline Flint said families are already struggling to make ends meet and called for ministers to get to grips with energy bills . But Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy . spokesman, said people would not understand why bills had to rise when . British Gas was making so much money. ‘Hard-pressed families and businesses . need much more transparency on costs, pricing and profits to know . whether they’re getting a fair deal,’ she said. ‘Unless ministers get to grips with . spiralling energy bills, people will rightly think that this Government . is completely out of touch with families and pensioners struggling to . make ends meet.’ Michelle Mitchell, of the charity Age . UK, said: ‘Reports of price hikes as we head into winter will be leaving . many older people feeling extremely anxious about their heating bills. 'Cold homes pose a serious risk to the health of older people, yet a huge . number of older people cannot afford to heat them properly.’ Feeling the chill: Gas price rises could hit the most vulnerable, including the elderly and poor . Energy bills have doubled in the past . decade and last year each of the big six hiked prices. British Gas . pushed them up by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity. The firms blame the price hikes on the . rising cost of imported gas on international markets. However wholesale . energy prices are currently £51 per megawatt hour, compared with £54 . per megawatt hour this time last year. In the first six months of the year . Centrica posted a 23 per cent rise in operating profits for its domestic . heating and power division, making £345million before tax. 'Keeping the lights on': Managing Director of British Gas, Phil Bentley, defended the company's price hikes . The latest price increase comes just months after chief executive Sam Laidlaw received pay and perks of £4.1million for last year's work. He was also awarded shares worth an additional £5.05million which he could be entitled to receive in 2014 depending on the company's performance. His perks include a £684 discount on his annual energy bill - more than half the amount paid by the average family. Energy firms . hiking prices just before winter is a familiar story, with the prices . falling once the cold months are over. The falls tend to be much smaller . than the rises however. Ann Robinson, director of consumer . policy at uSwitch, said British Gas’s move was ‘devastating', adding: 'This is a bitter blow for consumers and comes just ahead of winter when the impact on bills will be even more acute. 'With SSE’s price hike coming into effect next Monday and now Britain’s biggest supplier announcing a hike of its own, the writing is on the wall for consumers this winter – energy bills are going skywards. 'Consumers will be very disappointed – the pressure of an extra £100 or so on energy bills will leave many buckling and forced to face another winter where they are scared to turn on the heating for fear of the cost. 'Consumers cannot afford to sit back. There’s more than £300 difference between the cheapest and most expensive energy tariffs on the market – this is like shaving a quarter off your annual bill. 'Given today’s news, I would urge consumers to switch now to get the benefit on their winter bills.' Unions and consumer groups angrily attacked British Gas and called on the Government to take urgent action to tackle rising fuel prices. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: 'With winter approaching, low-waged people will now be terrified about how they are going to find another £80. 'Money from the poor is going to the pockets of Centrica shareholders. This is further shameful abuse by out of control, greedy fuel companies, sitting on piles of profit. 'Alongside the Government's punish the poor strategy, millions of households will be forced further and further down the path to poverty. It is high time that the Government intervened to take back from these grasping companies. Why is it that when wholesale fuel prices go up, these companies take from customers, yet, when wholesale prices go down, they still take from customers?' Citizens Advice is running a Big Energy . Saving Week from October 22 to 27 to help consumers find ways . to cut their fuel bills. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian . Guy said: 'Many British Gas customers will find the possibility of a . price rise really frightening. 'Bill increases throw already stretched . budgets into turmoil, with people forced to find more ways to scrimp and . save. But there are things that people can do to save money on their . fuel bills.' Rising prices: Graph showing the difference between wholesale and retail gas prices . Dozens of new gas power stations could be built across Britain to help slash long-term energy prices. Energy Secretary Ed Davey told The Times he will propose a loophole to get around costly climate change targets to stem the ever-soaring price of electricity. Under Mr Davey’s proposals, energy companies would be allowed to dodge new emissions targets because of concerns about the cost of building wind farms and nuclear reactors. A sight to increase in Britain? The National Grid power plant based in the Isle of Grain, Kent . His plans would allow energy companies to sidestep having to cut their own carbon footprints - a key goal of environmental groups - if other sectors can instead cut emissions and go green cheaper through advances in technology. Mr Davey told The Times: 'Let’s imagine that in 2022, a new technology comes along which makes it quicker and cheaper to decarbonise in the transport sector than it would in the energy sector. 'We want to make sure that policies we put in place are flexible, so that the transport sector would take up more of the slack.' He said the UK will be forced to still rely on gas in the coming decades, saying: 'I think people need to be rather calmer about this debate. 'Gas in the next few decades is going to play a critical role in our energy and climate change strategy. It’s not gas versus renewables versus nuclear. We are going to need them all.' The idea of the loophole was criticised by environmental campaigners, who said it could be exploited.","British Gas today announced a six per cent price hike - increasing the average bill by around £80 to £1,336 a year .

Crown Court yesterday . Two con artists have been found guilty of defrauding one Britain's wealthiest men out of £12million by exploiting his deep religious beliefs. George Katcharian, 60, and Cemal Esmene, 56, were convicted at Norwich Crown Court yesterday of tricking former car dealership businessman Graham Dacre into parting with a vast chunk of his £70million fortune. After a complex four-week trial jurors took a day to convict Katcharian and Esmene of conspiring to defraud philanthropist Mr Dacre, who had been persuaded to hand over the cash after being told it would make vast sums for his charitable ventures. In addition Iranian-born Katcharian was also found guilty of conspiring to defraud a German church of £8million. Esmene was convicted of laundering the cash after a huge four-year probe by detectives. Born-again Christian Mr Dacre, who was . ranked at number 793 on the Sunday Times Rich List, was convinced by the . pair that the money would be invested in a secret trading platform that would reap huge returns. Mr Dacre, 60, made his fortune . through car dealerships and sold the Lind Automotive Group for £108m in . 2006 to fund Christian projects, which include the Open Academy and the £12million Open Youth . Venue, in his home city Norwich. Throughout the trial the pair insisted they were innocent and blamed an associate called Ian Yorkshire, 62. Earlier this year Yorkshire was convicted of laundering the money which the international gang persuaded Mr Dacre to hand over in May 2008. Police will now set about trying to retrieve the millions that has been taken from Mr Dacre through the Proceeds of Crime Act. It is believed much of the cash ended up in northern Cyprus and Australia. Norfolk detectives are understood to be talking to their counterparts in those countries as they bid to track down the money. They also believe Esmene spent some of the cash on homes in the upmarket village of East Molesey, in Surrey. Born again Christian Graham Dacre was convinced by the pair that his money would be invested in a secret trading platform which would reap huge returns . The court heard that Mr Dacre failed to heed warnings from his adviser Anthony Bunker that he was falling for a scam. The criminals transferred his money to a Swiss bank account before sending it on around the world. Mr Dacre was fed lie after lie, jurors were told. He met Cypriot Esmene at a Swiss bank in June 2008 in a desperate bid to find out why there was a delay in his money being invested in the scheme. After finally losing patience with the con artists' excuses, Mr Dacre reported the fraud to Norfolk Police in December 2008. Acting Detctive Inspector Rob Foreman, head of Norfolk Police's Economic Crime Unit, said last night: 'This is a successful conclusion to what has been a very complex and protracted investigation. 'The offenders targeted individuals and organisations that believed in ethical investment. 'They falsely persuaded them that a portion of their profits from the investments would benefit humanitarian projects aimed at helping some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people around the world. 'In reality the money funded the lifestyles of the offenders.'

Katcharian, a Danish citizen who was tracked down in Germany after an arrest warrant was issued, will be sentenced with Esmene on Monday. In May, Alan Hunt, 65, of Poole, Dorset, and Arthur Ford-Batey, 62, of Carlisle, Cumbria, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud Mr Dacre while Ian Yorkshire, of Brighton, East Sussex, was found guilty of conspiracy to money launder. They were jailed for a total of 23 years. Investigating officer Detective Constable Chris Gay, of Norfolk Police, said: 'Although the amounts lost by the victims in this matter were substantial, and the way in which they were convinced to part with their funds was complex, it was essentially a simple confidence trick. 'The principle remains that if an investment proposal looks too good to be true then it almost certainly is.'","Graham Dacre was .

Convicted child abusers will be forced to wear tracking devices upon their release, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has promised. Paedophiles will be equipped with GPS ankle tags so police can track their whereabouts after they have served their prison sentence. The new scheme will be rolled out across Britain early next year, the Ministry of Justice confirmed today. Promises: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling pledges to put GPS tracking tags on convicted paedophiles upon their release . Chris Grayling expressed his . 'horror' over the Jimmy Savile case saying no child should ever be . ignored when asking for help. After the recent scandals of Jimmy Savile and the Rochdale child sex ring he promises to ensure that child protection services, local authorities and police work together and receive proper training to deal with child sex abuse. He said: 'It is a tragedy every time a child’s trust is trashed, their vulnerability exploited and they are harmed by the adults who should be looking after them. ‘Protecting our children must be an absolute priority.’ The Ministry of Justice will be rolling out the new tracking system across England and Wales in April 2013. Shocked: Mr Grayling said he was 'horrified' by the revelations about Jimmy Savile's alleged sexual abuse of children . Repeat offenders believed to be of potential risk of harming members of the public, such as child sex offenders, will be forced to wear ankle tags similar to those used to monitor curfews. The GPS tags will be used in addition to the current system where a person convicted of sexual abuse is put on the Sex Offenders Register through contacting the police within 72 hours of their release from prison. Convicts must give their name, date of birth, home address and national insurance number as well as details of any vehicles they own. According to the Home Office, the compliance rate is around 97 per cent. Convicted sex offenders who fail to register with their local police are fined and may face a jail sentence of up to five years. Professions with responsibility for the wellbeing of children; head teachers, doctors, youth leaders, sports club managers and others, including land lords, are notified of the existence of a local sex offender on a confidential basis. UK police also use the Violent and Sex Offenders Register (ViSOR) which includes all registered sex offenders, people jailed for more than 12 months for a violent offence but also innocent people with no convictions which are thought to be at risk of offending.","Criminals convicted of child sex offences are to be monitored using GPS technology .

The family of a 17-month-old boy whose body was found buried in their backyard have been evicted from the home on the same day they lost custody of their two surviving boys. Claims that Heather Kowalczik and her boyfriend Robert Rodriguez killed her youngest of three and secretly buried him where her surviving boys would play was all the home's owners in Farmingdale, New York said they needed. 'This is my family's property for 52 years, I rented it to what I thought was a nice couple, and they turned out to do this in my family's yard,' the property's owner Angela Lancia told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Quick exit: The owners of the home where a 17-month-old boy was found buried in the backyard offered no patience in evicting the family suspected behind the boy's death . Secret burial: On Saturday the boy's body was found by police buried in this 3-foot-deep grave in the Long Island home's backyard . Shocking find: The boy was discovered in the backyard of this home after child protective services visited the family and inquired where their youngest born in 2009 was . State Police unearthed Justin . Kowalczik’s body from a shallow grave on Saturday after a child welfare . check led to an inquiry of the boy’s whereabouts. 'It's . pitiful what they did to that poor child, and then they made their . other children play in that yard. Some people got no conscience,' Mrs . Lancia said. On Tuesday every last item belonging to the couple was seen pulled from the two-family home and piled in the driveway, the same day an attorney for Rodriguez complied with a court request for the removal of his two surviving boys from his custody. Rodriguez's attorney Bryon Divins told Newsday that his client lost his . job and thought it was best for someone else to care for them. Though . neither Kowalczik or Rodriguez have been charged in the boy's . mysterious death, the home was not immediately visited by the couple leaving their belongings stacked and unclaimed outside. Parents: The boy's mother Heather Kowalczik and her boyfriend Robert Rodriguez have not been charged in the mysterious death and burial though Rodriquez, the father of Kowalczik's two older boys, is a person of interest . Outrage: The property's owner Angela Lancia says Kowalczik and Rodriguez desecrated her property by burying the boy in her backyard that has been in her family for the last 52 years . Investigation's end: After obtaining a search warrant for the home following an interview with the residents, officers found the boy's body resting along this fence line . 'Why he's not in jail? Why what kind of system do we have, what kind of system? They find him! What are they waiting for? They're waiting for evidence!' Luigi Lancia told ABC. Rodriguez who is the father of Kowalczik's two eldest boys, aged 6 and 9, but not the father of Justin, has been named a person of interest in the case. Police said Kowalczik told them Justin died in the summer of 2010 though his cause of death is currently not known while an autopsy is underway. On Tuesday a court requested the removal of Rodriguez’ two surviving boys shared with Kowalczik from his custody. Complying, Rodriguez's attorney Bryon Divins told Newsday that his client lost his job and thought it was best for someone else to care for them. Backyard party: Neighbours were shocked by the news saying they had celebrated one of the home's two surviving boy's birthday in the backyard in August . Chasing leads: State Police officers arrived in the dead of night to dig in the backyard after interviewing the boy's mother . After . Officials with Suffolk County's Child Protective Services visited the . family last week and realized one of the couple’s three boys was missing . they grew more concerned when the family couldn't account for the whereabouts of a child born in 2009. 'It is absolutely a suspicious death and it is being investigated as such,' said State Police Major Patrick Regan. 'We don't have a cause of death, and to our knowledge, there was never a report made of the child being missing.' Obtaining a search warrant and investigating the property’s backyard, it was there on the fence line they found the boy in a 3-foot grave resting near a soccer goal and children's toys. The circumstances of his death remain unclear while foul play is not suspected. Authorities said it’s still unclear why the family kept it a secret. On Saturday afternoon, after the boy's discovery, Rodriguez had refused to answer questions, Regan said. Root of the crime: Officers have made no arrests at this time though the boyfriend of the 17-month-old's mother is considered a person of interest while not cooperating with authorities . Other brothers: Officers said that the 17-month-old's surviving half-siblings, two boys, are currently in custody of county child welfare agents . 'He did not come in willingly. He is not cooperating,' Regan said. Neighbour Tekiera McCormack told Newsday that she was stunned. 'I can't see this,' she told the newspaper. 'This is crazy. She was a good mother. Those kids loved her.' Like Ms McCormack, Michelle Peavey said she's especially mortified by the news as the family held a birthday party for one of the boys in the backyard in August. 'You mean we were back there with a body? Oh my god,' Mrs Peavey told MyFoxNY. She said her own boys played in the backyard and attended that same birthday party. 'I just want to sell the house. I don't even want to come back here,' the property's landlord Louis Lancia told Fox at the time.

A bone fragment found in a mass grave could finally reveal what happened to a nine-year-old girl who was kidnapped 24 years ago. Michaela Garecht vanished in broad daylight outside a corner market in Hayward, California on November 19, 1988. The bone, which is three inches long, was originally sent with remains to another victim's family but is now undergoing DNA testing. It was removed from a well in Linden used as a dumping ground by the 'Speed Freak Killers' who went on a . methamphetamine-fueled killing spree in the 1980s and 90s. Scroll down for video .

Wesley Shermantine is on death row for four murders - Loren Herzog committed suicide in January-  but there are believed to be more victims. Earlier this year, Shermantine wrote to a local . paper saying that Herzog was behind the abduction of Michaela. On Monday, police told her mother Sharon Murch that they strongly believe the bone belongs to Michaela. It comes from a girl aged five to 13 years old from around the time that the child went missing. A detective revealed to Ms Murch that it is likely Herzog kidnapped her daughter. Ms Murch told ABC7 this is the most certain police have seemed in two decades of searching for her daughter. She said: 'I would like to have a . resolution. If Michaela died then I want to know that. It feels like it . might actually be the answer.' Snatched: The nine-year-old went missing from outside a grocery store on November 19, 1988 in downtown Hayward . Dig: Kimberly and Joann's bodies were found during this excavation in northern California . Hayward police are due to make a statement later today after DNA testing on the fragment is complete. In March, the remains of two . teenagers, missing since the 1980s, were found among hundreds of bone . fragments inside an abandoned well linked to the 'Speed Freak Killers'. Wesley Shermantine and Loren Herzog were childhood friends who embarked on a frenzied killing spree in the 1980s and are believed to be responsible for up to 20 murders. Fueled by meth, the two snatched victims for 15 years, many of whom have not been identified, before disposing bodies in remote locations across rural California. Shermantine is on death row after he was convicted in 2001 of four murders. Herzog was convicted of three murders and sentenced to 77 years to life in prison. His  sentence was reduced to 14 years after an appeals court tossed out his first-degree murder convictions because his confession had been illegally obtained. Herzog was paroled in 2010 to a trailer outside the High Desert State Prison in Susanville. He killed himself in January outside that trailer after learning Shermantine was disclosing more victims' locations. San Joaquin County Sheriff Steve Moore . identified Kimberly Billy, who went missing in 1984 at the age of 19, . and JoAnn Hobson, who disappeared in 1985 at the age of 16. Both were . from Stockton, California. Miss Hobson's mother sent her daughter's remains for further testing where it was revealed pieces belonged to up to four other victims - including Michaela. Michaela Garecht went missing shortly after 10am on November 19, 1988 when she and a friend rode their scooters to a grocery store two blocks from her home. When they came out of the store, Michaela's scooter had been moved further away in the parking lot, next to a car. When she went to retrieve it, a white male reportedly jumped out and threw her in the back seat. The little girl's friend, who was the only witness,  ran to the store for help but the kidnapper managed to escape with the child. Other families who also have waited in agony for news of missing young women may finally learn what happened to them. The family of  Ilene Misheloff, who disappeared in January 1989 when she was 13 have also been contacted. In February, Shermantine sent authorities on a massive search after he . agreed to disclose burial locations in exchange for $33,000 from a . bounty hunter. Authorities combed a remote Calaveras . County property once owned by Shermantine's family and excavated an . abandoned well near Linden. At the Calaveras County property, . they found the remains of Cyndi Vanderheiden, 25, who disappeared in . 1998, and Chevelle 'Chevy' Wheeler, 16, who disappeared in 1985.

So I . don’t think he even has an explanation.' The 20-year-old was speaking after her father, of Swindon, Wiltshire, was jailed for life after pleading guilty at Bristol Crown Court to Miss O’Callaghan’s murder. But he escaped justice over the murder of Miss Godden because of a police blunder. Halliwell, 48, admitted to a senior detective that he murdered Miss O’Callaghan and Miss Godden, and even led officers to their bodies. A High Court judge ruled that the confessions the father-of-three made during a three-hour period on the day of his arrest were inadmissible because Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher breached police guidelines governing the interviewing of suspects. The detective, who was leading the hunt for Miss O’Callaghan, failed to caution Halliwell and denied him a solicitor. The ruling by Mrs Justice Cox meant that Wiltshire Police had no other evidence against Halliwell to link him to Miss Godden’s murder and the charge was withdrawn. Ms Halliwell, speaking on ITV Daybreak, said she had received letters from her father but she has not replied to them. She said he had urged her to change her name a number of times. 'We have had quite a few letters that have said ""Sorry for putting you all through this"" and things like this,' she said. She added: 'As much as I want to hate him, I can’t.

It was hailed as one of the greatest moments in British television history but as the Queen appeared to parachute into the Olympic Stadium this summer Seb Coe thought: 'Oh my God! What have we sanctioned here!' As part of the lavish London 2012 opening ceremony Britain's Monarch was shown jumping from a helicopter with James Bond actor Daniel Craig, but ever since there has been mystery surrounding how, exactly, she was persuaded to do it - until now. Lifting the lid on her first movie role, Seb Coe has revealed the audacious stunt had been kept a secret from the Queen's own dumbstruck family who watched it unfold on July 27 this year. Iconic: The Queen was shown jumping out of a helicopter and parachuting into the Olympic Stadium in a secret sequence kept from her own family . Secret: Lord Coe has revealed in his book that he was one of a few people who knew about the audacious stunt but when it unfolded in front of him he thought 'What have we done?!' Prince Charles 'roared with laughter' and Princes Harry and William began yelling 'Go Granny!' as she was shown flying across the London sky before appearing in the Royal box, he said. In his autobiography, Running My Life and serialised in The Times, Lord Coe discusses how director Danny Boyle, LOCOG CEO Paul Deighton and even the Prime Minister had helped make it happen and admitted he was 'speechless and nervous' about it. 'When we saw those shoes and peach coloured dress disappearing into the night sky under a billowing parachute, we (he and Paul Deighton) looked at each other, both thinking ""Oh my God! What have we sanctioned here!""', he wrote. Reaction: The Queen's enthralled family, including her laughing son Prince Charles as she took her seat afterwards . During the ceremony Prince William and Prince Harry were sat behind Lord Coe, who was sat next to Prince Charles. 'Prince Charles looked at me and began laughing rather nervously, wondering where on earth this was going. And when the film cut to the shot of the Royal back, he had exactly the same reaction as everyone else, which was to assume that it was the lady who does the impersonations. But the moment she turned around and everyone realised ""My God! It really is the Queen!"" he began roaring with laughter. As for his sons, they were beside themselves. 'As she started her descent, two voices behing me (William and Harry) shouted in unison ""Go Granny!""'. Danny Boyle had the original idea and Lord Coe knew the Queen's deputy private secretary Edward Young. David Cameron was then informed, who also thought it was a great idea, so brought it up with the Queen during their weekly audience at the Palace. 'I'll never forget when Danny showed Pail (Deighton) and me the finished film.

Fox has become the latest major film producer to offer its movies for download - nearly a month before they are available on DVD or Blu-Ray. Alien: Prometheus will become the first release to be sold online at a lower price than hard copies at $15 (£9.30) instead of $20 (£12.50). The scheme will be trialled in the US but could come to the UK to as Tesco is a supporter. Prometheus is set to be the first film Fox offers weeks before its disc based release online. Some say the move could be the beginning of the end for physical discs . In America Alien: Prometheus will be downloadable from September 18, compared to October 11 for hard copies. It will be made available from the UltraViolet, a digital service which has united the film industry to combat piracy. Giants like Walmart, Microsoft, HP, and Netflix and Lovefilm along with electronic companies like Sony are in a 75-strong coalition are all hoping that quicker, high quality movies will tempt customers away from illegal downloads. James Gianopulos, chief executive of Fox . Filmed Entertainment, said that the company ‘felt it was a good time to . take a more dramatic step’ than they had been doing in the past. Prometheus is set to become the first film to be made available by Fox for download weeks before the DVD release. The e-films will be called ‘Digital HD’ or DHD to try and persuade viewers that they are getting something new. Other recently release Fox movies such as ‘Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,’ ‘The Watch’ and ‘Ice Age: Continental Drift,’ will also be available at the reduced price before discs. UV has been touted as a possible solution to stopping piracy and has won the backing of Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Films bought from one online ‘store’ will work with content bought from another, along with any apps bought from companies which are on board. There is no lock on the films either and you can stream or download the film whenever you want once you’ve paid for it. Ridley Scott's Prometheus, starring Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers, is set to be released at a digital download weeks before its DVD and Blu-Ray release. One UV account can be used by up to six people as well, meaning families need only pay for one subscription. If you buy a UV disc, then you can stream or download it as often as you like. Apple however has refused to join the consortium and instead offers films and TV shows through its iTunes service, although the restrictions on where you can play them are more onerous. Amazon and Google have also launched similar services as competition for broadband consumers heats up.","Move is seen as another nail in the coffin of traditional DVDs and Blu Rays .

But now MySpace is planning a triumphant return, and a sneak peek at the re-design suggests the pioneering social network may well be able to attract old fans and new with a new look that has already attracted admiring glances. The site - which has Justin Timberlake among its investors - is apparently vanquishing the old glitzy appearance, which was never helped by giving users control over their own colour-schemes, and brining in a sleek, minimalist experience which seems influenced by Microsoft's tile-based approach seen in the latest version of Windows. Scroll down for video: . Justin Timberlake lends his profile to the relaunch, with MySpace's Connections page displaying people's friends lists . A new interface for a new era: MySpace has been redesigned 'entirely from scratch' to take on Facebook . New tune: As before, MySpace will sell itself as a strong music destination, providing playlists and utilising its 42-million song library . A message posted yesterday on the myspace.com homepage promised: 'Coming soon. The new . MySpace'. A demonstration video showed off how the new interface both deeply integrates into Facebook and Twitter while offering its own spin on communicating online. MySpace's was one of the darlings of the internet in the early 2000s, but faltered fo0llowing a $580m purchase by News Corp in 2005. News Corp sold MySpace this June for $35million - just six per cent of its original purchase price. He played Napster entrepreneur and Facebook investor Sean Parker in the 2010 cinema hit The Social Network.And apparently the musician-turned-actor took the role home with him, as he was a key player in the $35million MySpace purchase from News Corp last year.Timberlake was announced as the leader of the business strategy during the take-over, and his profile is used within the MySpace demo video.At the time of the purchase, he said: 'There's a need for a place where fans can go to interact with their favorite entertainers, listen to music, watch videos, share and discover cool stuff and just connect. MySpace has the potential to be that place.'Art is inspired by people and vice versa, so there's a natural social component to entertainment. I'm excited to help revitalise MySpace by using its social media platform to bring artists and fans together in one community.'In another interview he said: 'They weren't successful in treating and evolving the product enough, it was basically this junkheap of bad design that persisted for many many years.'There was a period of time where if they had just copied Facebook rapidly, they would have been Facebook. They were giant, the network effects, the scale effects were enormous.' As Facebook's popularity soared, . MySpace tried to re-launch itself as a music-centric online community, . but never managed to reclaim its lost glory, and was stigmatised as a . site where people's profiles descended into a clash of colours and poor . layout. But MySpace promised to change yesterday. In a statement, the company said: 'We're hard at work building the new MySpace, entirely from scratch. 'But we're staying true to our roots in one important way - empowering people to express themselves however they want. 'So whether you're a musician, . photographer, filmmaker, designer or just a dedicated fan, we'd love for . you to be a part of our brand new community.'

Smartphone fans who rushed out to buy Apple's latest iPhone last month face an extra £5-a-month charge if they want to connect it to Britain's first 4G network, it was claimed today. Mobile network EE, which will be first to launch the new protocol on October 30, has admitted it will charge a premium for the service, which is up to five times faster than 3G. Although the company has not yet released its pricing strategy for 4G, it has been reported that customers will have to pay about £5 extra a month to connect to the network. Scroll down for video . The iPhone 5 is expected to be among the first handsets to be able to use high speed 4G networks . Over a two-year contract - typically already costing between £36 and £51 a month - that equates to a extra total charge of £120. EE is understood to be planning to offer a range of tariffs for connection to 4G. The company made no comment on speculation on the average £5 extra cost, reported in the Times today. However, a spokesman said: ‘It will be more expensive for phone users, but we really hope it will only be a fraction more expensive while also providing considerable value for money. We hope customers will be pleasantly surprised at the price.’ The company - a joint-venture between Orange and T-Mobile - announced the roll-out of the UK's first 4G network last week after spending £1.5million a day over the past year to get its infrastructure ready for the upgrade. CEO Olaf Swantee said then: 'We are . delighted to announce that the official launch of our new customer . brand, EE, offering the UK’s first superfast mobile 4G and fibre . broadband service, will take place on the 30th October 2012.

However, the threat of legal action meant it could not announce a launch date. EE said . it will offer 4G to customers by Christmas in London, Edinburgh, . Cardiff, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Derby, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, . Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and Southampton. The . group then plans to roll out the service to further towns, cities and . rural areas next year, with population coverage of 70% and rising to 98% . in 2014. The announcement came after last minute crunch talks between ministers and mobile operators lifted the threat of legal action delaying launches.

The computers look more like leftover props from a 1970s Bond film than a state-of-the-art mainframe that can shoot a missile into outer space. But this is the nerve centre where North Korean scientists will oversee the launch of a long-range rocket that they say will jettison a satellite into orbit. The take off, believed to be imminent and would be in direct contravention of UN resolutions, has spread alarm across the world as fears grow that the missile could also be used to carry a nuclear warhead capable of striking America. 007: North Korean technicians man computer terminals at North Korea's space agency's General Launch Command Center on the outskirts of Pyongyang in scenes more like those of a 70s Bond film . Fighter jets roared through the skies over downtown Pyongyang today as an American official told ABC News that the launch is expected to happen within the next 24 to 48 hours. He said, judging by the amount of fuel the North Koreans have pumped into the rocket, the trajectory could be very long - expected to fly south over the Philippines, jettison its satellite payload and splash into waters near Australia. David Cameron said he regarded the prospective firing as a breach of UN edicts. 'We need to send a very clear message to the North Korean leadership,' he told BBC Radio 5Live. 'They are not even able to feed their own people and yet they seem to be able to put satellites in the sky. 'They have a very clear choice. This regime needs to take a different path if it wants to be able to engage with the world.' The launch window opened during a week aimed at . celebrating Sunday's centennial of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the . country's late founder. Events also include high-level meetings where . new leader Kim Jong Un has received at least three new titles to further . cement his rule. Sparse surroundings: The computers look more like leftover props from a 1970s Bond film than a state-of-the-art mainframe that can shoot a missile into outer space . Final checks: A North Korean man looks down from a balcony the workers preparing for launch . North Korea had told international organizations that its rocket launch would come between Thursday and Monday, between 7 a.m. and noon local time. Poor weather made a Thursday launch unlikely, Philippine disaster managemment agency chief Benito Ramos said, citing an assessment passed on to him by the Philippine military, which is being briefed by U.S. and Japan counterparts. Wind in particular can scuttle rocket launches. North Koreans woke to details about . developments at a Workers' Party conference where leader Kim Jong Un . ascended to top posts and brought with him a new generation of . officials. His father, Kim . Jong Il, was granted the posthumous title of 'eternal general secretary' at the special one-day party conference Wednesday. The immortalization of the late leader . provided a glimpse into how North Korea will handle the nation's second . hereditary succession and indicates he will be honored much in the same . way his father, Kim Il Sung, was made 'eternal president' following his . 1994 death. Footage on . state TV on Thursday showed Kim Jong Un seated at the front of the . conference with white statues of his grandfather and a new statue of his . father in his trademark khaki work ensemble, one arm on his hip. On Mansu Hill, once the domain of a huge bronze statue of Kim Il Sung, a second covered statue awaits its unveiling. In 2009, a similar launch from an east coast site took place on the sec ond day of a five-day window. The . United States, Japan, Britain and others say the launch would . constitute a provocation and would violate U.N. Security Council . resolutions banning North Korea from developing its nuclear and missile . programs. Experts say the Unha-3 carrier is . similar to the type of rocket that could be used to fire a missile . mounted with a nuclear warhead to strike the U.S. or other targets. The . launch and Kim's formal ascension to top posts comes during a week of . events leading up to celebrations Sunday marking the 100th anniversary . of the birth of his grandfather, late President Kim Il Sung. The . centennial is a major milestone in the nation Kim founded in 1948, and . the streets of the capital, Pyongyang, were awash with new posters, . banners and the national flag. The streets were busy with women clad in traditional Korean dresses and children waving red flags. The . Taedong River flyover of fighter jets was practice for a military . parade, officials said. North Korea's army celebrates its 80th . anniversary later this month. The expected satellite launch is one of the marquee events this week. North . Korean space officials call the launch of the Unha-3 rocket, mounted . with an Earth observation satellite, a 'gift' to Kim Il Sung. They said Wednesday that the final . step of injecting fuel into the three-stage rocket was under way in the . coastal hamlet of Tongchang-ri. 'We . are injecting fuel as we speak,' Paek Chang Ho, chief of the space . committee's General Command Center, told reporters given a chance . Wednesday to visit the control center outside Pyongyang. He said the rocket was ready for liftoff as soon as engineers are given the green light. North . Korea has informed international aviation, maritime and . telecommunications authorities that the launch will take place between . Thursday and Monday. Because liquid rocket fuel is highly . volatile and corrosive, its injection into the rocket is usually one of . the final steps in the pre-launch process, experts say. But the weather, . and particularly the wind, could force delays. An . analysis of recent satellite images shows preparations appear compete, . the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced . International Studies said. Images . taken by a commercial satellite earlier in the week revealed increased . activity at an instrumentation site that would track and collect data . from the rocket to be passed to the launch control center. A mobile radar tracking antenna also was removed from its stowed position, indicating it has been checked out for operations. The . analysis for the institute's website, 38 North, also says a mobile . optical system appears to have been set up to track the rocket's flight. The . planned launch was a focus of discussions among foreign ministers from . the Group of Eight leading industrialized democracies. 'I think we all share a strong . interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, and we will be discussing . how best to achieve that as well,' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary .

A group of journalists walk down a road in front of North Korea's Unha-3 rocket which it is expected to fire in the middle of April . Paek . denied Wednesday that the launch was anything but a peaceful civilian . bid to send a satellite into space. He said the Kwangmyongsong-3 . satellite is designed to send back images and data that will be used for . weather forecasts and agricultural surveys. 'Some parties insist our peaceful . space program is a missile test,' he told foreign reporters given an . exclusive tour of the nation's main satellite command center. 'We . don't really care what the outside world thinks. This launch is . critical to developing our space program and improving our economy.'

Sage played the 66-year-old's onscreen son in Rocky V . Autopsy scheduled to take place in next 48 hours . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:23 EST, 14 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:33 EST, 15 July 2012 . The body of Sylvester Stallone's son laid undiscovered for at least three to four days before being found Friday in his Los Angeles home, according to new reports. Coroner's officials are still investigating the death of 36-year-old Sage Stallone who is understood to have overdosed on prescription pills found at the scene. According to TMZ, the filmmaker 'lived like Howard Hughes' in a room 'littered with junk' - and his body could have laid cold for as long as a week. Tragedy: Sylvester Stallone's son Sage was found dead Friday afternoon in his Los Angeles apartment after a suspected drug overdose. He was 36, pictured here in 2006 in Hollywood . A source told the website Sage was . living like a recluse at his Studio City home, and had not spoken to his . family for a week before his body was discovered. A housekeeper who is believed to have . been at the residence earlier in the week was reported to have . been instructed never to enter his room, which a law enforcement source . described as 'disgusting' and foul-smelling. Sage's mother, Sasha Czack, is said . to have called the housekeeper on Friday to check on him after she was . unable to reach her son. That is when the body was discovered, according . to TMZ. Sudden death: The body of the 36-year-old Sage Stallone was brought out to the coroner's van in Los Angeles . Recluse: Sage's body was allegedly not found for days after his death . A friend of Sylvester Stallone's late . son has meanwhile disputed reports the 36-year-old committed suicide, saying he . was 'healthy and upbeat' just two weeks before his sudden death. As coroner's officials investigate if . the death was accidental, a friend of the young filmmaker says he is . baffled by the news because he 'never knew him to do drugs'. The friend, who was not identified by RadarOnline, told the website: 'I saw him two weeks ago and he seemed great. He was healthy and upbeat and didn't seem depressed at all. At work: Sylvester Stallone appeared at a Comic-Con event in San Diego on Thursday, shortly before his son's sudden death . Grief-stricken: The star has said he is 'devastated' by the loss of his eldest child, Sage . Pronounced dead at the scene: The coroner's van was spotted at Sage's home in Los Angeles along with news crews . Unresponsive: The filmmaker's body was taken straight to the coroner's office - and not to the hospital . 'I never knew him to do drugs, not . even weed, so for him to die from an overdose is kind of shocking to me. I am totally stunned.' Radar reports an autopsy will be performed as early as Sunday, however, toxicology tests will be needed to determine cause of death. The results of such tests could take weeks. Sylvester Stallone on Friday said he is 'devastated' and 'grief-stricken' over the death of his son. A source told Radar that medics . arrived on the scene at 3.05pm Friday afternoon and spent around 25 . minutes trying to revive Sage before his death was pronounced at the . scene. Devastated: Sly's agent released a statement saying he was 'grief-striken' at the loss of his son . Mystery: An autopsy is scheduled to take place in the next 48 hours to determine the cause of death . Red carpet smiles: Sage pictured in 1996 at the Hollywood premiere of Daylight with his father Sylvester and his now-wife Jennifer Flavin . Family: Sage had become reclusive since the red carpet appearance with Jennifer and his father, Sylvester Stallone, according to reports . Walking down the aisle: Sage, pictured left, led his mother Sasha Czack down down the aisle as she wed Rich Ash in April 2000 . Double act: Sage appeared alongside his father in the 1990 movie Rocky V, playing the role of Rocky's son Robert Balboa . His body was taken straight to the coroner's office - and the insider claims no suicide note was found. 'I suspect he had been dead for quite a while when he was discovered,' the source told the website. 'Usually medics will be at the scene . for around forty-five minutes but they were out of there within half an . hour. 'There were a number of prescription bottles found at the scene but it did not appear to be suicide and no note was found.' A 9-1-1 call  was placed shortly . before 3pm and the caller said Sage wasn't breathing and indicated it . could be a drug overdose, Radar reports. An autopsy is scheduled to take place in the next 48 hours. Shortly after news of Sage's death, a . spokesman released a statement on behalf of his action hero father, 66, . who was at the Comic Con film convention in San Diego yesterday. Before the heartbreak: Stallone was pictured yesterday with Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Comic Con film convention in San Diego . 'Sylvester Stallone is devastated and . grief-stricken over the sudden loss of his son,' the actor's . spokesperson Michelle Bega said in the statement. 'His compassion and thoughts are with Sage's mother, Sasha.' 'He was a very talented and wonderful young man. His loss will be felt forever.' Police said they found the younger . Stallone in the home while responding to a 'welfare check', however . Sages' lawyer George Braunstein said he was found by a housekeeper. Friends and acquaintances had become concerned because they hadn't heard from Sage in the past day. Hand in hand: Sylvester pictured back in 1982 with his first wife Sasha Czack, Sage's mother . Braunstein said the death came as a shock, telling the New York Post this afternoon: 'He was in good spirits, and working . on all kinds of projects. 'He was planning on getting married. I am just devastated. He was an extremely wonderful, loving guy. This is a tragedy.' Sage Moonblood Stallone was the . oldest of Sylvester Stallone's children and co-starred with his father . in two films. He was the first of two sons Stallone had with first wife . Sasha Czack. He made his acting debut in 1990's . Rocky V - he played his Stallone's onscreen son - and also appeared with . his father in 1996's Daylight. Also in 1996, Sage Stallone and . veteran film editor Bob Murawski co-founded Grindhouse Releasing, a . company dedicated to preserving and promoting the B-movies and . exploitation films of the 1970s and 80s. He also directed the 2006 short Vic, which screened at the Palm Springs Film Festival. Braunstein said Sage had frequent requests to work on films. 'He was a full of life filmmaker with . his whole future ahead of him,' he said. 'He was just very up and . enthusiastic and positive. 'I think it was probably some sort of accident,' he said of the death, and claimed he had never seen Sage take drugs. He told E! News: 'I never knew him to drink alcohol. I never saw him take drugs. I never knew of anything like that.' The lawyer has also made claims that Sage in fact posted photos to his Facebook account 17 hours before his body was discovered. Braunstein added that Sage Stallone greatly admired his father but was working hard to make his own name in the film industry. 'He was very proud of his father and proud to be his father's son,' he said. Stallone's split from Sage's mother Czack in 1985 after 11 years together. They also have a another son . Seargeoh, 32, who is autistic. Big boots to fill: Sage said he always worried about living up to his father's success, seen here together again in Rocky V . He wed model and actress Brigitte . Nielsen in the following December in Beverly Hills but they split just two . years later in a very public divorce. He married third wife, Jennifer . Flavin, in 1997 after an eight-year on-again, off-again relationship and . they have three daughters: Sophia Rose, 15, Sistine Rose, 14, and . Scarlet Rose, 10. Sage, who . was raised by his mother following his parents' divorce, felt distant . from his father growing up, a theme which hit home as they were filming . Rocky V together. ‘When I was screaming, “You never spent time with me! You never spent time with my mother!” - that was true,’ he told People magazine in 1996. ‘I was looking into my father's face and really saying that.’ But it proved a turning point for the father and son, who went on to form a close bond and they acted again together in the 1996 film Daylight. ‘Between takes, Sly and Sage would roll around in the dirt like two puppies,’ the director Rob Cohen observed at the time. Sage certainly felt the pressure of growing up with such a famous father and would worry that he would never match his success. ‘I tell him, “As long as you give it your best, that's all that matters,” his mother Sasha said in that same year. Sage went on to pursue a career behind the camera and shunned the wild Hollywood party scene, preferring to watch horror zombie films instead. ‘People call me a hermit,’ he said while promoting the film. ‘But I'm happy.’","Sylvester Stallone's son, 36, found dead at Los Angeles home Friday .

'What I don’t understand why women who have flat chests can receive implants off the NHS - yet I can’t have my saggy skin removed because it is non-essential,' the former Preston College student said. Spare flesh: Anthony says the rolls of excess skin left after his rapid weight loss are making him depressed . Unemployed Mr Coulton, who said he can't afford to pay £6,000 to have the surgery privately, said he is psychologically affected by his rolls of saggy skin, and that getting rid of them would 'change my whole life'. 'No matter how much I train, nothing can get rid of this extra skin around my waist, so removing it surgically is my only option. 'The only way I can live my life to the full and forge a good career for myself in the army is having it removed. It would cost £6,000 to get it done privately, but I don’t have that kind of money. 'I can feel the saggy skin jiggle when I’m running - so I couldn’t imagine getting down to the ground to do press up in front of the guys. I wouldn’t even be able to go swimming as part of the training. 'I just want to feel normal - I’m not asking for the world. I have never asked for any help until now - I lost all the weight on my own by getting on the treadmill. 'But I now feel more miserable now than I did when I was fat because this excess skin is stopping me from what I want to do in life - it is making me so depressed.' 'I would gorge on everything and anything': Anthony, pictured holding his little brother Tom, once ate up to 100 packets of Doritos or Frazzles every week . It was depression brought on by his parents divorce that saw Anthony start to pile on the pounds at the age of 14. 'I would gorge on everything and anything, but Doritos and Frazzles crisps were my favourite - I'd eat around a hundred packets a week. 'Crisps were my favourite - I'd eat around a hundred packets a week' Anthony Caulton . 'And I’d drink a two litres bottle of coke a day - I’d have it by my bed so it was the first thing I tasted in the morning - I was so bad.' The teenager would spend all of his money on junk food and obsess about what he was going to eat next, but managed to keep his addiction hidden from those closest to him. 'I would stash all the junk in my bedroom and I wouldn’t eat anywhere else,' he said. 'I would eat beans and toast for breakfast every morning and then I’d go without food all day at school so people wouldn’t see me eat. 'I would get called all the fat jibes thrown to me at school, but I didn’t care, I just hated my life and food was my comfort. 'I remember I was 16 when the scales in my bathroom couldn’t even read my weight because I was so heavy - the dial kept going round and round. That was when I was 21 stone - I was only 16.' 'Miserable': Anthony has said he can't afford to pay thousands to have the excess skin surgically removed privately . The turning point came in May last . year when Anthony came across a shoebox full of photographs and medals . from his days of playing for a junior football team. 'I . remember putting one of the medals round my neck and felt a buzz of . happiness - it realised it had been the only in my life when I’d felt . proud of myself and I wanted to get that feeling back,' Anthony said. 'I had always wanted to join the army but was told I needed to get down to 12 and a half stone. 'My . dad would joke and say I would be on my death bed before I’d decided to . do it - and it would be too late. It was at that moment I decided to . turn my life around and lose the weight.' Anthony enrolled at a gym in Preston . the next day and devised his very own fitness plan which he followed . religiously, building up from walking to interval training then . eventually running. 'It was tough, especially the mentality needed to do it, but I was so determined,' he said. 'After a month I’d lost a stone and the weight started falling off me. 'I . felt really positive and like my life was going in a new direction. I . still felt massive, but every day I trained and every pound I lost meant . I was one step closer to my dream career.' Determined: Anthony devised his own military-style fitness regime and stuck to it religiously . 'Mortified': The Preston teenager says he would be too embarassed to take his top off or do press-ups in front of other soldiers . By February, Anthony was a stone under the army’s goal weight for entry - and his application could go through. The . delighted teenager contacted his doctor to seek advice on getting rid . of his folds of loose skin, but despite being referred to specialists . for a consultation he was told he could not have the operation due to . NHS policy. The NHS will not pay for body contouring for cosmetic reasons alone. 'I could go into the army with it but I could never feel comfortable,' said Anthony. 'I am confident in my fitness and mental ability but I have absolutely no body confidence because of it. 'I dream of going to Afghanistan one day but I could never ever take my top off in the heat - I’d be mortified.' Dr . Jim Gardner, NHS Central Lancashire medical director, said: 'The . primary care trust has a policy in place to help make clear and rational . decisions in difficult cases such as this. 'Cases are considered carefully by a panel of experts and there is always an appeals process available.' he added.","Anthony Caulton shed almost 10 stone after embarking on a military-style fitness regime to fulfill his dream of joining the army .

Telemundo model Irizarry, 34, says she was punched in the face after greeting Ebanks' boyfriend, former BET host Terence J, with a kiss on the cheek. She claims a drunken Ebanks told her 'don't be kissing my man' and struck her on the nose. Scroll down for video . Claws are out: Telemundo presenter Liza Irizarry (left) is suing Selita Ebanks (right) over claims the Victoria's Secret supermodel broke her nose in a brawl at a Miami nightclub over Ebanks' boyfriend Terence J . 'I went to swing back — that's when all her friends jumped in. I felt hair pulling and fists coming at me,' Irizarry said in an interview in her lawyer's Manhattan office. The fight, which broke out at 5am in Miami’s Dream nightclub last November, was broken up by one of Irizarry's male friends. It was only the following morning when she realised the extent of her injuries. 'I was in so much pain,' Irizarry, of the Bronx, told the New York Daily News. 'My pillow was covered in blood.' Days later, she had surgery for a complex nasal fracture. 'Don't mess with my man!': A drunken Ebanks allegedly punched Irizarry in the nose after reacting furiously when the Telemundo model greeted Terence J (left) with a kiss at the Dream nightclub in Miami last November . She said: 'I'm so angry, because she thinks she can get away with anything. Me saying hello to someone doesn’t give you the right to hit me.' Irizarry will be filing for assault and battery in Hudson Superior Court and is seeking damages for pain, suffering and medical bills. According to her lawyer Edward Steinberg, Miami police have not arrested Ebanks even though Irizarry filed a report and sent officers her medical records. Ebanks’ lawyer, Paul Rothenberg, says his client said the 'claims are baseless'. 'In so much pain': Irizarry claims she woke the next day with blood all over her pillow after suffering a complex fracture of her nose. She is claiming damages from Ebanks for pain, suffering and medical bills . In an interview earlier this month, Ebanks told how she was head over heels in love with actor Terence J, who this year has starred in Think Like A Man and Sparkle as well as taking up a new position at E! News. 'We’re just happy to be in love and be a part of each others lives,' she said. The Cayman-born model, who played a phoenix in Kanye West’s 2010 video, has worked for high fashion brands Neiman Marcus and Ralph Lauren, and appeared in magazines such as the Sports Illustrated and Vogue. She is best known for her work as one of Victoria Secret's 'Angels' from 2005 to 2009.

"By . Paul Sims . UPDATED: . 10:45 EST, 6 March 2012 . Jon Venables (pictured aged ten) abducted, tortured and then murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. He was jailed last year after he was caught with a stash of depraved images . Child killer Jon Venables is being kept in prison for his own safety – because he cannot be trusted with keeping a new identity secret. Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were ten when they were jailed for life after they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993. When they were released in 2001  amid a public outcry, they were given new identities to protect them from vigilantes. But after Venables was jailed again last year, when he was caught with of stash of child pornography, it emerged the killer had already blown his own cover. Officials have now ruled out giving him a second false identity – which costs taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds – on the grounds he would not be able to keep his real past hidden, sources have told the Mail. The extraordinary development means that Venables will remain in prison for the foreseeable future for his own safety. Denise Fergus, James’s mother, said: ‘In his twisted mind he believes the name Jon Venables makes him some kind of celebrity and he cannot resist telling people who he really is. ‘It seems he gets some kind of perverse thrill from it, and it’s clear he has no remorse about murdering my son.’ A surveillance camera shows James holding the hand of Venables as he is taken from the Bootle Stand shopping mall on February 12, 1993 . Draconian legal anonymity orders ban any information being revealed about the identities or whereabouts of Venables and Thompson, who killed James after luring him away from his mother in a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside. During Venables’s child pornography trial last year, his barrister claimed the strain of living under an assumed name and constant threats to his life had led him into drink and drug addiction. He then apparently became paranoid that friends had discovered his true identity and he began telling them who he really was, before calling his probation officer to raise the alarm. Victim: Jamie Bulger, 2, left, was murdered after being led away from a shopping centre and right, his mother Denise Fergus, who said Venables 'cannot be trusted outside prison' Officials are now convinced that if released after completing his two-year sentence he would not be able to keep secret a second identity, leaving him a sitting duck. ‘If Venables were to be given a new identity the chances are that he would compromise it,’ said a source. ‘That puts him in danger of vigilante attacks. ‘It is safer for him if he remains in custody until he no longer poses a risk of revealing his true identity. Venables received a life sentence for the murder of James Bulger, so they can keep hold of him for as long as they want.’ The decision not to give Venables a new name comes despite a High Court ruling that he was in ‘clear and present danger’ of being killed should his true identity ever be revealed. Last night, prison sources confirmed there were ‘no current plans’ to create a new identity for the 29-year-old killer, who is still using the alias he was given in 2001. ‘It would be a pointless waste of money  giving him a new identity at the moment because he is unable to keep his real name a secret,’ said one source. ‘He remains at risk of revealing his true identity, and until that is resolved he won’t be given a new name or be released from prison.’ Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: ‘Changing a criminal’s identity is an extremely expensive thing to do. The decision will not be taken if there is a risk the individual involved would fully disclose his identity to others. ‘For his own safety, to protect the individual from others, he would remain in confinement in prison.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment.","‘If Venables were to be given a new identity the chances are that he would compromise it.

Police  have now been in contact with the mother of dead superstar Michael Jackson after she was reported missing on the weekend.Katherine Jackson, the grandmother and guardian of the singer's three children, is safe and with a family member in Arizona, authorities said late on Sunday, just one day after another relative reported her missing to police.Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Mark Pope said investigators made contact with Mrs Jackson, but he did not have specifics on her whereabouts.The agency previously said they believed she was with a relative and safe, but wanted to speak with her, a request that went unanswered.Son Jermaine Jackson said in a statement: 'Mother is safe and well in Arizona with her daughter and our sister, Rebbie, resting up on doctor's advice, so it is beyond me how she can be reported ""missing.""'He said access to his mother is not being blocked but that her access to phones and computers was removed for her well being.'Furthermore, it dismays me that such an alarmist ""missing person"" report has caused unnecessary anxiety among Michael's children who will understandably react to what they misunderstand, hear or are told,' he said. Scroll down for video . Safe: Kelly Griffin, LaToya Jackson, Stephen Hill, Katherine Jackson and . daughter Rebbie (far right) who the grandmother is staying with in Arizona . Katherine's grandchildren reported losing contact with her for a week, . and nephew Trent Jackson filed a missing person . report on Saturday night. Mrs Jackson's brief disappearance occurred at the same time of a brewing . battle among other family members over his will believed faked after his . death in June of 2009. The grandmother and her three grandchildren are . the sole beneficiaries to the singer's estate, 's disappearance . Worried for her grandmother's safety, Michael Jackson’s daughter Paris . tweeted on early Sunday that she wanted her to return home. ‘Yes, my grandmother is missing. i haven't spoken with her in a week i . want her home now,' the 14-year-old tweeted adding a number to call if . there was any word. Legal guardian: Katherine Jackson, far left, is guardian to Michael's children Blanket, third left, Prince, center and Paris, right. She and his three children are also Michael's only beneficiaries. It was unclear who is taking care of the children in Mrs Jackson's absence. At the same time of Paris' pleas for help, her uncle Jermaine tweeted . his own of assurance that his mother was safe and being taken care of . during a time of medical need, naming a mini-stroke in recent months. Concerned: Paris asked for help . finding her grandmother while concerned she's in the care of a man she . disproves of . The stroke was initially disputed by the teen who tweeted that ‘nothing had happened to her.’ The tweet was later deleted. The incident demonstrated divisions in the Jackson family just days . after five of the singer's siblings once again claimed that the King of . Pop's will was a fake and that the executors of his lucrative estate . should step down. The undated letter, signed by Janet, Randy, Tito, . Rebbie and Jermaine Jackson, claimed Katherine Jackson was being . manipulated by the executors, John Branca and John McClain, her health . had been affected, and she suffered a mini-stroke. 'the same doctor that testified on . behalf of dr murray saying my father was a drug addict (a lie) is caring . for my grandmother... just saying' The estate has denied the accusations, . which have swirled since Michael Jackson died from an overdose of a . powerful anesthetic. Katherine Jackson obtained permission from a judge . to investigate the will's validity, but never pursued the matter in . court. Hearing her grandmother . was sent away on doctor's orders did little to calm Paris, . who expressed concern of a possibly more dangerous situation brewing. ‘The same doctor that testified on . behalf of dr murray saying my father was a drug addict (a lie) is caring . for my grandmother... just saying,’ she wrote. Radar Online identified that doctor . as Dr Allan Metzger, the same who wrote fraudulent prescriptions for . Michael's sister Janet Jackson leading to his 2009 reprimand by the . Medical Board of California. Appeal: Paris Jackson, Michael's 14-year-old daughter, tweeted her concerns for her grandmother on Sunday morning . Last fall he testified in Dr Conrad .

LaToya, left and Rebbie, right, are seen beside her earlier this month . while sources say the grandmother is currently staying with Rebbie in . Arizona . Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for the June 2009 propofol overdose death of Jackson at age 50. According to Radar Online, Metzger was called on specifically by . brothers Jermaine and Randy Jackson to treat their mother last week. Metzger is not Katherine Jackson's primary physician and her regular . doctor wasn't aware of his house call until concerns about Katherine . Jackson's whereabouts were raised, Jackson’s lawyer, Sandra Ribera said. Reassuring: Michael's brother Jermaine assured that his mother is resting under doctor's orders but without her grandchildren claiming to know much more . Status updates: Jermaine Jackson took to Twitter to issue statements on his mother's whereabouts through the weekend . A phone message left for Metzger at his Beverly Hills practice was not immediately returned Sunday. Earlier in the weekend he had said his mother was in Arizona resting 'on . the orders of a doctor, not us,' where he reported himself being too. He reports his mother having suffered 'a mini-stroke some months ago. Doctor's orders: Dr. Allan Metzger, Michael Jackson's former physician, . is seen last October during the Dr. Conrad Murray involuntary . manslaughter trial. He's reported to be currently caring for Katherine . Jackson in Arizona . 'She is fine now, but the timeline doesn't alter the fact it happened,' he tweeted. Michael’s three children have lived with their grandmother since their . father's untimely death. Not speaking to them for a week was unheard of, . according to Ribera.

She had been scheduled to depart on an RV trip to the Southwest to watch . her sons perform. The elder Jackson never made any of the shows and .

The boxer was cleared of a rape charge . at Norwich Crown Court last July after prosecutors offered no evidence. He had consistently denied raping a woman in November 2010. Hide said he was seeking further legal . advice to see if he had any civil redress against the woman who made . the allegation and the Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case . to court. He added after the hearing that he . felt bitter about the woman keeping her anonymity while he was named in . press reports after being charged. Hide reportedly splashed out £150,000 on antiques to furnish his new home after moving in around 15 years ago. He joked at the time that he was going . to call the house SheWish - short for She Wished She Lived Here - as a . warning to scare off gold digging women. But instead he has called it Longland Farm, the traditional name of the farmhouse which used to be on the land.

A British couple have been living in a garage for four-and-a-half years after their house in southern Spain was demolished over 'planning irregularities'. Len and Helen Prior, both 68, are now launching a landmark legal case to get compensation after their luxury villa became the first home owned by Britons to be bulldozed - despite having the correct planning permission from the Spanish authorities. The retired expats have been living in the garage on the plot of their demolished home since 2008, when the villa was destroyed. Ground-breaking: Helen and Len Prior - pictured at their partly-demolished villa in Vera - say their compensation claim is their last hope . The couple have turned the villa's former garage and workshop into a cramped dwelling - and have converted an adjacent caravan into a bathroom . Ramshackle: The couple's makeshift home, which they put together on the plot of their partly-demolished villa . The couple claim the construction of their home - in Vera on Spain's southern Costa Almeria - was above board and was given the green light by the local town hall. However, their licence was revoked by the regional government of Andalusia who claimed there were 'planning irregularities' and ordered its destruction. It is unclear precisely what these irregularities were, but - a year after their home was destroyed - the Priors won a small victory when Spain's Constitutional Court ruled demolition was illegal, the Telegraph reported. Their only option now is to sue the Spanish judiciary - but it could mean the couple spend the rest of their twilight years battling it out in the courts. Mrs Prior told The Telegraph: 'It's our last hope but we've been warned it would be a ground . breaking case. The Spanish authorities hope that we will . give up and just go home. 'But this is our home. We have . nowhere else to go to. I do wonder how many years I have left to live . and it's so upsetting to think that they will probably be spent fighting . on. But we won't give up. We can't.' Landmark case: The Priors have been warned they could spend the rest of their years battling in the courts . The Priors say they have been advised that, because the demolition order was signed by a judge, legal action should be taken against the judiciary system itself. According to the ruling by the Constitutional Court, Spanish law was broken when the destruction order was signed, not only because the authorities had failed to inform the Priors of the decision but also as an appeal was pending on their case. The couple are now awaiting a court date after travelling to Madrid to file their case against the Judiciary. However, they have been warned the legal process could take years and, even if they win, the Spanish authorities might not even be able to pay. The country is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy as the economic crisis worsens. The Priors were among the earliest . victims of a series of illegal building scandals in Spain which arose . after a development boom - fuelled mainly by British buyers - in the . 1990s swamped stretches of the Mediterranean coast with apartments and . villas. During the frenzied years of . building, many local town halls apparently turned a blind eye to . planning regulations or even took bribes to grant building licences to . thousands of homes that were constructed on protected land. After the heartbreaking ordeal of seeing their dream retirement villa destroyed, the Priors now call this home . Sign of the times: A poster saying 'make do and mend' in the couple's makeshift kitchen is an ironic nod to their ordeal . This caravan is now the couple's bathroom. They use a water pipe belonging to a neighbour and get electricity from a generator . However, crackdowns by regional and . national governments led to the arrest of dozens of planning officials, . and thousands of homes were under threat of demolition. Len and Helen Prior sold their . family home in Wokingham, Berkshire, and built a £350,000 retirement villa in the . seaside town of Vera in Almeria nine years ago. The luxury villa was built to their . own design specifications and was affectionately given the name of . 'Tranquilidad' to reflect the couple's hopes of how they would spent . their retirement. From the start they did everything by . the book, employing a reputable lawyer and obtaining a building licence . from Vera town hall before the property was built. What they didn't know was that behind . the scenes, the regional government in Seville had already warned town . hall planners that the development should not go ahead because it . entailed urbanisation of 'rustic' land. In January 2008, their home was . demolished in front of them after a dramatic stand-off during which Mr . Prior, who has a heart condition, collapsed and was taken to hospital. A bulldozer ploughs into the couple's home, back in 2008, pulling down the property they had put all of their savings into . Dashed dreams: Helen tends to Len on the ground after he collapsed when their home was bulldozed in 2008 . The Priors in front of the remains of the demolished home, a property built to their own design and was affectionately named 'Tranquilidad' After clearing the rubble, the Priors - . bit-by-bit - converted the garage and workshop once adjoining the villa . into a cramped dwelling and an old caravan has been turned into a . makeshift bathroom while a shed has become a lavatory. There is no mains electricity source, so power comes from a small generator and they use a neighbour's water pipe. Mr Prior said in a previous interview: 'We're pensioners and we shouldn't have to live like this. 'We . couldn't have done more to ensure our home was legal. What's happened . makes me extremely angry and it's the anger that keeps me going. If it . wasn't for the anger, I think I'd collapse.' In fighting the case, the couple's . legal bills in their compensation fight - as well as a new licence to . rebuild their home - has grown to 150,000 euros. Mr Prior told The Telegraph: 'I can honestly say that that . they [Andalusia government] have wrecked our lives. They have taken . everything we worked for away from us, 45 years of working hard and now . we have nothing.'","Len and Helen Prior have been told an order to bulldoze their home was 'illegal'

Two men who escaped with their lives when their twin-engine plane burst into flames and took a nose dive into the Gulf of Mexico, have not only lived to tell the tale of the harrowing ordeal but remarkably managed to document their survival with an iPad camera. As pilot Theodore Wright, 37 and his best friend, Raymond Fosdick, took off from Baytown, Texas in a tiny Baron aircraft on September 20th, they were looking forward to a smooth journey to Sarasota, Florida. But when after two hours the cockpit began filling with smoke, a high-risk emergency landing on water quickly looked inevitable for the two men. Scroll down for video . Survivors: Two men whose twin-engine plane crash landed in the Gulf of Mexico, floated in the water for three hours waiting to be rescued while filming their ordeal on an iPad recovered from the aircraft before it sank . Partners: Pilot, Theodore Wright (left) and his best friend, Raymond Fosdick (right) had been flying from Baytown, Texas to Florida when two hours after take-off, disaster struck . Rapidly descending 11,000 feet and landing some 30 miles from the Louisiana coast, the men grabbed the most important equipment for survival as the left the plane: flotation devices and of course, an iPad. Talking to the Today Show about their incredibly story, Mr Wright recalled the moment disaster struck along a route her had flown many times. Safe: Back on dry land, the pilot (left) and his passenger (right) told the Today Show how the cockpit began to fill up with smoke and before they could finish their SOS call they were covered in flames . 'We were flying along, I'm eating a bag of M&Ms, I check in with Houston centre,' he said. 'And then we see a little bit of smoke which typically is not a huge deal - usually a radio will smoke a little so you throw the electrical power off, everything's fine. 'I made a quick radio call to Houston centre, told them we have a problem. Before I finished the radio call, we were just covered, covered in smoke.' A pilot since he was just 15 years old, Mr Wright and his well-travelled friend immediately sprang into action, deciding together what steps they should take - the kind of cooperation, says Mr Fosdick, that ultimately saved them from the clutches of death. Vessel: Ted Wright's Baron twin-engine plane before it plummeted 11,000 feet into the Gulf of Mexico and sank 30 miles off the coast of Louisiana . Route: The journey from Baytown, TX to Sarasota, FL was a familiar one to Mr Wright who has been flying since he was 15 years old . 'There was no praying, there was no thinking the world was coming to an end,' he said. 'That's pretty much what saved our lives. Being able to recognise the aircraft's loss, now it's just save ourselves.' Mr Wright credited their astonishing ability to remain so calm and focussed on the problem, to training. 'You kind of go onto autopilot in these situations, no pun intended,' he joked from the comfort and safety of ABC's studio sofa. Indeed coastguards have called their emergency landing and the way they handled the terrifying ordeal as 'textbook', but what happened next was perhaps a little more improvisational and off-text than a traditional emergency plan might advise. On impact, as the plane began to sink . quickly and the men realised they had no time to waste in ejecting . themselves from the cockpit, Mr Fosnick grabbed an iPad that was . concealed in a water resistant protective case and plunged into the open . sea. Saved! After three hours floating adrift on the ocean, as the two men began to worry about the night ahead, they were spotted and airlifted to safety by a coastguard . Stoic: Mr Fosdick (left) and Mr Wright (right) kept calm throughout the ordeal comforted by the fact that they had set off an emergency beacon and rescue services should have been able to find them . Remarkably undamaged, the iPad camera was used by Mr Wright and Mr Fosnick to record moment-by-moment the events that followed their crash-landing for posterity, unsure of what fate would hold for them. The first clip was filmed within an hour of landing. With no sign of the coast guard or rescue emergency services, they calmly informed an audience: 'We did have a sport fisher on the horizon. We tried to flag him down. We tried to signal him without any luck.' What has inspired and amazed the public about the story is the unbelievable lack of panic or hysteria exhibited throughout the ordeal. 'People ask us ""were you worried?"" We . weren't worried at all,' explained Mr Wright in New York. 'We knew . there were three positioning devices that coud find us.' 'But . when the first aircraft passed over our heads and didn't see us and . we're waving and waving. And they still don't see us. And the second . aircraft shows up, they don't see us? Yes, we started to get nervous.' Modern rescue: The iPad filmed the two men as they tried to flag down a sport fisher and two planes to no avail and hope began to wane slowly . Yet with no hint of lost hope or melodrama, the pragmatic pilot spoke a final time into the Apple device. 'Hopefully this is the last recording because we will be rescued soon. Signing off,' he said before switching the iPad off. Luckily, their metaphorical prayers were answered and just before night fell, the two men were spotted and airlifted to safety by a coast guard. All involved knew that a night time rescue would have been next to impossible. Back on dry land and carrying his arm in . a sling, Mr Fosdick announced confidently to the Today Show: 'I have no . hesitation whatsoever of climbing into another aircraft again. My wife . on the hand... does not want me to do much.' Experienced: Mr Wright credited their survival to training and an ability to remain calm while focussing on the emergency at hand while his friend said working together was vital . And while his pilot friend allowed himself to admit that it was 'pretty scary,' he also informed viewers that he already has another plane and will continue his work to support the program Around the World for Life that gives aeroplane rides to kids to cancer. 'Nothing has changed, except the tail number,' he laughed. Asked a final time whether at any point they feared the worst, Mr Fosdick elaborated: 'Fear definitely plays a role. I won't lie and say I didn't have any fear... However because of experience and because we've been in stressful situations, we were both remaining calm and you begin looking at your options, even though they're very bleak and grim out there in the middle of nowhere. 'We did spot an oil rig just out on the horizon. It becomes one of those things of, ""okay if it gets dark and they leave what are we going to do?"" So there was some fear involved but it wasn't enough to overpower our patience.'

A stroke victim was forced to wait an hour for an ambulance because staff were on a 'meal break'. Carl Brown, 47, found his retired cook mum Pauline slumped in her chair when he returned to their Liverpool home. He rushed to get his sister-in-law who lived four doors down before making the first 999 call. But an hour lapsed before a crew finally arrived at the family home with  the driver admitting managers had forced them to take a break. Anguish: Retired cook Pauline Brown agonising hour wait for ambulance after suffering stroke . The delay came despite a high profile government TV advertising campaign entitled Act F.A.S.T which set out the symptoms of a stroke and the need to seek prompt medical attention. Carl said: 'We’ve all seen the adverts that say ""act fast after a stroke,"" but we had to wait an hour for the ambulance. 'The driver said to me ""this is unofficial but we saw your mum’s job pop up on our screens, but we were told you’ve got to have your 20 minute break.""

'We offer our most sincere apologies for . any distress that may have been caused for this patient and their . family, whilst waiting for an ambulance.' Angry: Son Carl Brown helpless for an hour as waited for 999 crew . Mrs Brown suffered the stroke 12 days ago when Paul returned to the home in Stonebill Road, Old Swan, on September 14. The first 999 call was made at 5.16pm as other family members and neighbours rushed around to help while the emergency operator gave instructions down the phone on what to do. When help finally arrived, his mum was rushed to hospital and later transferred to Broadgreen Hospital. Describing the lasting effects caused by the stroke he said she could answer ‘yes’ to some questions. But he added: 'She’s not going to get any better and her quality of life is not going to improve. 'She paid her taxes all her life and should have had an ambulance when she needed it.' 999: Paramedic ambulance crew taking a patient on a stretcher into hospital.

David Cameron has given ministers until the end of the week to find the money to help the heroes of Bomber Command pay for the unveiling of a memorial to their fallen comrades. The Prime Minister intervened last night to insist that the shortfall for the cost of staging the event in June, which was attended by the Queen, will be met by the Government. Anxious Second World War veterans had feared losing their homes as ministers refused to fill a £550,000 gap in funding for the poignant ceremony. Poignant: The memorial in Green Park depicts airmen returning from a raid and the PM has given ministers until the end of the week to help pay for its unveiling . Survivors had already raised £6.5million . to build their own monument to recognise the sacrifice and bravery of . the 55,573 comrades – nearly half the unit – who lost their lives during . raids against the Nazis. But the hard-pressed Bomber Command Association trustees had also found themselves liable for the outstanding bill for the unveiling ceremony in Green Park, central London, which attracted more than 6,500 veterans, widows and children. Until now, pleas to ministers for financial assistance to settle invoices from firms who provided seating, security, insurance and catering have fallen on deaf ears. But last night, Downing Street sources said Mr Cameron had ordered a U-turn. Culture Secretary Maria Miller is expected to announce that her department will make up the shortfall as early as today. ‘The Prime Minister has taken a personal interest, given all the concerns that have been raised. He has said we need to find a way to sort this out and find the money that they need,’ said one source. ‘Downing Street is working with the Culture Department and we will have a result by the end of the week. We need to have a conversation with Bomber Command to establish precisely what they need and then we will find the money across Government. ‘Given the role veterans played in the War, and the commitment of all those involved in the memorial, the Prime Minister feels strongly that this is the right thing to do.’ Earlier in the day, former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth had urged ministers to ‘bite the bullet’ and make up the difference. The Queen and Prince Philip, right, talk to a former member of Bomber Command, after unveiling the Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park in June . Praising the ‘decisive’ move, he said last night: ‘I am absolutely delighted. I know the Prime Minister has a very deep affection for the Armed Forces and it is excellent news that this now looks like it is going to be resolved. ‘The veterans made provision for a modest ceremony. But such was the public support and enthusiasm to honour those who gave their lives that the cost of the day itself increased enormously. ‘It would have been unthinkable that these guys should be required to dip into their own pockets.’ The Government has already waived £1million in VAT on building the memorial and provided £375,000-worth of support for the ceremony in the form of RAF personnel and aircraft. This was on top of £200,000 from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Earlier in the day, mobile phone tycoon and philanthropist John Caudwell, who contributed £1.8million towards the memorial, had tried to shame ministers into action by suggesting he would make a further contribution as ‘a last resort’ if necessary. The Phones4U founder said last night: ‘I have got to know a lot of these trustees as friends and the stress of all this has affected their health. If the Prime Minister has sorted it out, that is fabulous. I think it’s completely outrageous that the trustees have been in this position and I am not prepared to see them lose their homes.’ By Robert hardman . So three bold old men can now sleep more soundly in their beds – and the relatives of 55,573 heroic airmen can allow their blood pressure to return to normal. The extraordinary saga of the Bomber Command memorial would appear to have been resolved and the trustees behind this magnificent monument will not be left to shoulder a thumping £550,000 bill for the opening ceremony after all. Following an appeal by the Mail, a generous offer by the philanthropist, John Caudwell, and the wise intervention of the Prime Minister, common sense has prevailed. Saga resolved: The scene in Green Park in June when the Queen unveiled the memorial . As the Mail reminded its readers yesterday, the new memorial, opened just over three months ago by the Queen, was long overdue. While all the other notable participants in the Second World War have long had a national monument to their endeavours, there had been none to the men with the bleakest life expectancy of the lot. Nearly half of the 125,000 men in Bomber Command perished. Come peacetime, though, the bombing of German cities sat uncomfortably with the narrative of victory. There wouldn’t even be a campaign medal. Yet, the fact remained that 55,573 families had lost a father, husband, brother or son. Where were they to lay their wreaths? Four years ago, Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb – whose family had worked in the factories which built Lancaster bombers – joined forces with a team of volunteers to make amends. It was a long haul but they managed to raise the £6.5million required to build an appropriate monument. And very fine it is too – poignant, proud yet utterly non-triumphal. It even includes a dedication to all those who died, the bombed as well as the bombers. When it came to this summer’s opening ceremony, the trustees received early ministerial assurances that the Government would help cover the costs of a dignified event. But they were victims of their own success. The event ballooned into a state occasion with a huge royal, diplomatic, political and military turnout (plus all the consequent security). Applications from veterans and bereaved families were treble the original estimate. The Bomber Command Association, while delighted by all the interest, was a little overwhelmed. Bills poured in. On the eve of the ceremony, for example, the trustees were stunned to be handed a fresh insurance demand for £50,000. One of the organising committee managed to produce a personal cheque for £22,000 just to secure enough portable loos. To make things worse, it would later turn out that those ministerial assurances had not been set in stone. Some, like the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, did their bit and paid up. Others did not. The Ministry of Defence even tried to present its Lancaster Bomber flypast as payment in lieu. That was little comfort to the eight trustees – three of them veterans – this week as they found themselves liable for a £550,000 deficit. Yes, they were not as thorough as they should have been in their financial management. But who can blame them? They were organising an unveiling, not a state occasion. They aren’t clever accountants or civil servants. They are that great British institution without which civic society would fall part – a committee of volunteers. And they have achieved a great thing with their memorial. It would have been wholly unjust for them to be punished for it.","PM has given ministers until the end of the week to find the money .

'Happy and Caring': Courtney Holdcroft died after being hit by a bus outside her school in Stoke . A 12-year-old schoolgirl was killed after being pulled under the wheels of a bus as she crossed the road to join her friends on the other side. Courtney Holdcroft suffered fatal injuries after being hit by the single-decker bus - which was travelling at just 19mph - as her friends shouted at her to 'watch out'. The pupil tried to run out of the path of the bus, but was 'sucked' under the wheels and crushed, an inquest heard. Courtney was hit by the bus as she left an after-school club at Ormiston Sir Stanley Matthews Academy in Stoke, Staffordshire, on June 13 last year. The schoolgirl had spotted her friends on the other side of the road and was struck as she attempted to cross and join them. One pupil said in a statement: 'We told her to watch out for the bus. She tried to beat it but she couldn't and then she got sucked under it.' Kenneth Harper, 64, a passenger on board the bus, said: 'The bus was coming down the road slowly when two lads ran across the road. 'The driver started to brake a bit, then I saw this young girl hit the windscreen and heard a thud. 'It was just something that happened. It was very out of the blue,' he added. The 12-year-old, who was described as a 'happy and caring' girl with a talent for music, was taken to hospital by air ambulance but later died from her injuries. Bus driver Derek Oates, 62, said the tragic accident had left him traumatised. 'I am very sorry, there is nothing that can change what happened. I have been traumatised by it all.' 'Tragic accident': Schoolgirl Courtney, above left and right, had a talent for music, an inquest heard . Courtney’s mother Lyndsay . Rogers-Coates said at the inquest: 'When we got to the school the air . ambulance was just taking Courtney to the hospital. 'We were taken into the relatives’ room at the hospital where the nurse told me to go and see Courtney as . she was very poorly. 'When I went in there I was told to say my . goodbyes.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Staffordshire assistant deputy coroner David James said: 'This was a tragic accident. 'Courtney was a perfectly happy young girl who was sadly confronted with a situation like this. 'The only consolation is that she would not have known about it as she died from multiple injuries including severe head injuries. At the time of the tragedy the school's principal Mark Stanyer described the 12-year-old as a 'lovely girl who did her best at everything'. 'We were very proud of her and words cannot explain just how devastated we all feel about this tragic accident,' he said at the time. Up to 1,000 people signed a petition following Courtney’s death calling for a crossing patrol outside the school. Stoke Council has said it is awaiting a full police report detailing the causes of the accident.","Courtney Holdcroft was hit as she crossed the road outside her school in Stoke to join her friends on the other side .

The European Union said there was a ‘lost generation’ of 18 to 25-year-olds emerging, as figures showed the number out of work in the eurozone had reached a record 11.4 per cent – the 16th straight monthly rise. Some 18.2million people are unemployed in the eurozone, the highest level since the euro was introduced in 1999.

Senior Tory backbenchers will warn Andrew Mitchell that his foul-mouthed outburst at police has damaged the party and undermined support among MPs. The Tory Chief whip will get the message when he meets the six members of the executive of the influential backbench 1922 Committee on Wednesday. The meeting is one of three hurdles Mr Mitchell has to clear if he wants to hold on to his job, senior Tories have said. The Chief Whip is facing calls to quit after allegedly calling police officers ‘f******* plebs’ after they refused to let him cycle through the main gate of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell says he will sit next to David Cameron during Prime Minister’s Questions at noon on Wednesday. Labour MPs have launched a ‘Get Mitchell’ operation and are planning to cause mayhem by shouting abuse at Mr Mitchell and at Mr Cameron for refusing to sack him. Later that afternoon Tory MPs with a grievance will be able to state their views at a meeting of the 1922 committee. There will be a slot in the agenda when MPs can raise any issues of concern. Chairman Graham Brady will then lead a six strong delegation for a regular meeting with the Chief Whip. Allies of Mr Mitchell say he has the backing of the majority of ministers and MPs. But many have privately said they think he should resign. ‘It is the 1922 Committee’s role to communicate the views of MPs to the Chief Whip. You can be sure they will do that,’ one member of the committee hierarchy said. Facing a tough time: Mitchell will sit next to David Cameron during Prime Minister's questions on Wednesday when Labour MPs are planning on bringing up the issue . Mr Mitchell will come under further pressure because Labour will challenge Tory candidates for crime commissioner to say whether they think he should resign. Labour candidates for the new posts, who are elected next month, will today receive letters putting them on the spot. Delegation: Conservative chairman of the 1922 committee Graham Brady will lead the meeting . A Labour source said: ‘The letters will challenge the Tory candidates to say whether or not they agree that Andrew Mitchell should resign.’ Mr Mitchell won growing public support from the Cabinet yesterday, as a series of ministers took aim at the Police Federation for using the incident as a stick with which to beat the government in their row over cuts. They are angry the Police Federation of West Mercia called for Mr Mitchell to quit after a meeting on Friday, even though the Met officers concerned have accepted the Chief Whip’s apology. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘His conduct was unacceptable, he’s accepted that. He’s apologised. 'I think really the matter should be left there. He’s issued a full, public apology. He’s apologised to the person, to the police officer concerned. ‘I think it’s a mistake for the Police Federation to be trying to use this in the way that they are. 'I think frankly we need to get on with sorting out issues and challenges related to policing.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Clearly these instances aren’t helpful and you should never be rude to a policeman.’ But asked how many MPs had come up to him and said Mr Mitchell should go, Mr Shapps replied: ‘I cannot recall a single MP who has come to me.’","Andrew Mitchell allegedly called police officers 'f******* plebs' after they refused to let him cycle through the main gate of Downing Street .

At first glance, a cemetery on the grounds of a former boys’ reform school is nothing more than what it appears, marking graves of former students who died during influenza outbreaks and fires with simple metal crosses. But now investigators believe that there may be more bodies near the site where 31 white crosses mark where bodies of students of the Florida School for Boys were laid to rest. Though the school was shuttered last year and a 2009 investigation cleared the school of any criminal wrongdoing with the 31 unidentified boys, the bodies of up to 50 other students have not been accounted for. Scroll down for video . House of horrors? The Dozier School for Boys was a reform school on Florida's panhandle with a possibly sinister past . Little house: Former students said that they were punished in what they called the 'white house,' this small cinder block building . Marked: Also on the campus are 31 marked graves, where victims of influenza and a fire in 1914 were laid to rest . Former students of the Dozier School for Boys, now aged 60 or older have told horror stories of how they were beaten as boys, in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Though a Florida State Investigation from 2009 concluded that the 31 graves on site held victims of the flu and those who died in a 1914 fire, the story the former students tell is much more sinister. Anthropologist Erin Kimmerle, from the University of South Florida, is working with a team of experts to search the grounds, located on the Florida panhandle. Dr Kimmerle told CNN that of 100 children who died while at the school, no burial records exist for 22 of the boys. Some students, now long past boyhood, said of how boys at the institution were raped and beaten without mercy. They call the whitewashed cinder block shed where they were beaten the 'White House,' and call themselves the White House Boys. Ovell Smith Krell, now 83, said that her brother, Owen Smith, was sent to the Dozier School for Boys in the spring of 1940, after running away from home and later stealing and wrecking a car. Correctional facility: The school was in operation from the beginning of the 20th century until a few years ago . More bodies: An investigation by the University of South Florida reveals that there may be more bodies in unmarked graves; bits of red are likely human remains . According to a 2009 letter written by Mrs Krell, the family never heard from Owen again. She said that her mother wrote to the school to inquire about her son’s whereabouts, but was told Owen escaped. Lost: Owen Smith died in 1940, though accounts of his death are unclear; his sister thinks he was killed at the school . The school then said he was caught and captured by the sheriff’s department. When their father came to claim his son, he was told that he was sent back to Dozier. It is unclear what then happened to Owen. Mrs Krell said that she talked to a former student who said that he saw Owen being taken into what was known as the White House, a place where boys were disciplined on campus. She wrote: ‘When they brought him out, they were carrying him. The boy said they heard his screams and that he was taken to the infirmary.’ Mrs Krell’s mother continued to write to the detention centre for months, until the school finally said that Owen’s badly decomposed body had been found under a house. The school said that he had most likely died of pneumonia and was under the house to try to keep warm. However, the doctor and lawyer living in the house told Mrs Krell that they never heard or smelled anything. Mrs Krell told CNN that she hopes to give her brother the burial he deserves. ‘I would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in their cemetery,’ she explained. ‘I hope I get the chance.’","Campus of now-closed Dozier School for Boys contains 31 graves of those who died during influenza outbreak and fire in 1914 .

Noel Polanco, 22, was fired at when he cut off the police car near New York's LaGuardia Airport, after they shouted at him to put his hands up, a witness said. Passenger Diane DeFerrari insisted Mr Polanco never even took his hands off the wheel and the police had acted out of 'road rage.' Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Noel Polanco, 22, was shot dead by a police officer as he drove two passengers home from the bar where he works . Horrified: Passenger Diane DeFerrari, who worked at the Ice Lounge bar with Mr Polanco, said he was not given a chance to put his hands up before police shot him . Officers who had given terrifying chase in an unmarked vehicle screamed, 'Put up your hands!', and then shot Mr Polanco a split-second later, she said. 'It was simultaneous,' she added. 'There was a pop and Noel gasped.' After the shooting, Ms DeFerrari, 36, said . she and a backseat passenger, an off-duty NYPD officer, were ordered out and . told to put their hands on the car. 'The cop said, ""Your friend just shot . himself"",' said Ms DeFerrari. 'I didn’t dispute what I saw because I . was afraid. They wouldn’t let me look at him.' The officer riding in Mr Polanco’s car, . 29-year-old Vanessa Rodriguez, was waving her police ID out the window . just before the shooting, sources said. Second witness: An off-duty police officer and friend of Mr Polanco and Ms DeFerrari's was riding in the back of the Army reservist's car . Investigation begins: Veteran police officer Detective Hassam Hamdy had never shot his Glock pistol before while on duty . Detective Hassam Hamdy insisted he pulled . the trigger after Mr Polanco, from Queens, reached down for something that turned . out to be a yellow-and-black power drill, a source told the Daily News. Ms DeFarrari is a bartender at the Ice Lounge in Astoria, where Polanco worked in the club’s hookah section . Det Hamdy, a veteran police officer who had never fired his Glock pistol before on duty, shot Mr Polanco in the midsection, sources said, and the 22-year-old died at 6am at New York Hospital Queens. Mr Polanco’s devastated mother Cecilia Reyes, 46, said: 'I never had to worry about him. 'He had never been in a precinct in his life. He was in the military and would never do anything to endanger his career. Ms Reyes, clerk at Elmhurst Hospital, sobbed as she described her son as funny and outgoing. 'They are going to pay for this,' she said. 'We want justice.' Mrs Reyes was distraught, said family friend Tito Cordero, having also lost her husband in the past three months. Shocking death: Police claimed the 22-year-old made a move to pick something up from by his feet . Disturbing allegations: Ms DeFerrari said the police ordered her and her fellow passenger out of the car and told her Mr Polanco had shot himself . Mr Cordero told DNA Info: '[Mr Polanco] doesn't fight. He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. He just works to get his mind off all the problems.' Mr Polanco’s 15-year-old sister, Amanda Reyes, said: 'My brother’s dead, but I have faith that we’re going to get justice.' With the shooting under investigation, Det Hamdy’s frantic wife defended her husband. 'It’s definitely scary for me, but I have faith in him,' said Christine Hamdy outside their Long Island home. 'I don’t know, what can I say? He’s good at what he does.' Mr Polanco's police officer passenger Ms Rodriguez has a checkered history with the NYPD, according to court records. She was stripped of her gun and badge after being busted for stealing a sweater from an H&M store in June. Ms DeFerrari had served Mr Polanco and Ms Rodriguez cognac before they all left the club where she worked at 5am, said NYPD spokesman Paul Browne. The spokesman said Mr Polanco had offered to drive the two women home to save them the taxi fare because all three are from the same neighborhood. Ms DeFerrari, a mother of three, denied Mr Polanco was reaching under his seat when he was shot, insisting, 'his hands were on the steering wheel' the whole time. Conflicting stories: Police say Mr Polanco was speeding and weaving through traffic at 5am, and that they believed he was armed when he reached towards his feet, apparently to pick up a power drill . She said the trouble began after Mr Polanco tried to maneuver around slow-moving traffic. 'They tried to run us off the road,' said Ms DeFerrari, who said she was sober at the time but has been caught for drink driving before. 'They were shouting obscenities and the driver was sticking his middle finger out at us,' she said. 'Noel sped up to get away from the car. There were no sirens, just lights. I told Noel to stop the car, but we caught a clearing and took off.' She said the unmarked car caught up and blocked their path. 'All hell broke loose,' said Ms DeFerrari. 'They jumped out with rifles drawn. One guy had a handgun. They ran at us.' Police later showed her a photo of Det Hamdy, who she identified as the officer who shot her friend. Police said Mr Polanco was heading east in his Honda Fit when his speeding vehicle was spotted by two unmarked Emergency Service Unit vans. 'The car was weaving in and out, going between the vehicles,' said police commissioner Raymond Kelly. 'They turned on their lights and tried to pull him over. He didn’t pull over.' 'Afraid': Mr Polanco never even took his hands off the wheel, said Ms DeFerrari, right . Devastating: Mr Polanco has drunk a cognac at the Ice Lounge in Queens, pictured, shortly before he was killed . One of the ESU vehicles pulled in front of Mr Polanco’s car and forced him to stop. Det Hamdy and another uniformed officer climbed out and approached the Honda from opposite sides of the vehicle. 'The bartender reports hearing police telling people to keep their hands up,' said Mr Browne. 'The last time she looked at the driver, [Mr Polanco’s] hands were still on the wheel.' Ms DeFerrari told police she felt a mist on her face, which she realized was the driver’s blood. The behaviour of the detective who fired has been questioned before. He and six other police officers were accused in 2007 of beating and terrorizing a Queens couple. The city settled their claim for $235,000. In 2008, Det Hamdy and an officer were credited with convincing a Queens man to give up without a fight after he attacked a man with a machete and hurled Molotov cocktails at police. At the Ice Lounge, investigators retrieved video footage, and Mr Polanco’s co-worker, Oscar Zuniga, mourned his friend. 'I never saw him drink, I never saw him drunk,' insisted Mr Zuniga, 26.

Facebook was caught out providing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officials inaccurate and inflated estimates of the number of its users and ultimately its worth just a week . before the company's disastrous IPO, it emerged today. A flurry of 12 letters between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Facebook depict a reluctant management team repeatedly playing cat-and-mouse over official requests to release figures and in the end being forced to withdraw information that was in reality guess work at best. Most damning is the suspicion that Facebook did not have accurate figures for the number of smartphone users who use its application and intentionally held back the real, significantly lower figures, until only a week before the $104 billion IPO on May 18th. Scroll Down for Video . Amateurish: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks to the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2012 conference on September 11, 2012 in San Francisco . This information has come to light after the dozen letters dating . from February 1st through to May 17th, . were published on the . SEC's website 20 days after the company's initial public offering. The contentious exchanges were over Facebook’s apparent failure to disclose the exact figures for mobile phone user growth, where they were geographically located, and how it planned to make money from them. This has led some analysts to conclude that Facebook knew their valuation and business plan wasn't watertight before launching at $38 a share and that the company should have postponed the public offer. 'They were given the benefit of the . doubt when they went public that they were ready for prime time,' said . Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc. 'They still haven’t proved that they are.' In the initial IPO filing from February 1st, the company said smartphone usage of Facebook increased around the world and numbered 425 million 'monthly active users' in December 2011. It accepted that it hadn’t proven it could 'monetise' individuals using only mobile devices, where the absence of ads may 'negatively affect our revenue and financial results.' The SEC asked for a 'more detailed' analysis of these key challenges requesting to see the company's plan B should their attempts to corner the mobile market fail - an eventuality which the SEC described as being 'disastrous.' Replying on March 7th, Facebook's lawyer Jeffrey Vetter disclosed that Facebook's mobile monetisation strategy could run up 'excessive expenses' but still refused to number the users who 'primarily accessed' Facebook through their smartphone, saying they didn't have a 'reliable' count. Disastrous IPO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks to the TechCrunch Disrupt conference four months after the firm's shambolic share offering . When asked by the SEC to locate geographically its users it said that it couldn't do so reliably, because for instance Facebook counted most BlackBerry owners as Canadian because their servers are based in Canada. This prompted the SEC to question whether Facebook actually had 845 million individual users at the start of 2012 which the firm replied they believed was 'reasonably accurate.' They reveal a volley of messages between the commission, Facebook's Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman and their law firm Fenwick & West LLP and show that Facebook was aware of many of the issues currently unnerving investors. Central to these correspondence were the claims that Facebook made on February 1st that their mobile figures were backed by audience share accounting firm Nielsen and highlighted their ability to utlilise the burgeoning smartphone market - on which advertisement's are not as easily viewed as on a home computer or laptop. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had to fight Facebook tooth and nail on 92 points of information it wanted to see ahead of its May 2012 IPO . Barbara Jacobs, an assistant director for corporation finance at the SEC was skeptical that Facebook could deliver on these claims and questioned where they had drawn their figures from after the Internet company cited respected Nielsen as their source. After an ultimatum for Facebook to produce a Nielsen backed study, the social networking firm dropped the reference and admitted the claim was drawn from marketing materials only and subsequently ceased to mention them on February 28th - 27 days  after it filed its proposal to go public. Bloomberg News has trawled through the letters and correspondence and noted they show Facebook executives holding back crucial details which are only revealed when the SEC pushes for their disclosure. In one exchange, the SEC notes that Facebook in some cases was counting mobile users twice and Jacobs wrote on March 22nd, 'Please explain to us how you determined that your metrics are not overstated?' Fallen since May: Today's Facebook share - which is around 45 percent down on the $38 dollars it opened at in May . Furthermore, on May 9th, eight says before the IPO, Facebook finally made clear to the SEC that daily mobile customers were increasing faster than the advertising revenue growth - thereby revealing a shortfall in the expectations of the much vaunted and imminent IPO. Even though the exchanges are now months old, the issue is more relevant now than before, as the Menlo Park, California based firm how counts one billion users worldwide. This is up from 845 million at the year's start and of which the firm claims 600 million access Facebook through their mobile device. Since their disastrous IPO, Facebook has dropped to almost a half of its offering price, amid concerns over its ability to monetise the growing mobile market. Faceplant: Mark Zuckerberg on May 18th - the day of the Facebook IPO . Other's are just as critical. 'We've been growing increasingly skeptical of some of their monetisation methods,' said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research to Bloomberg Television. What investors who bought up Facebook shares in May did not have a chance to see until a month after the IPO were requests from the SEC that pushed Facebook to disclose how they planned to deal with challenges they faced such as decelerating revenue growth, user count and its growing dependency to online gaming firm Zynga Inc. Current SEC policy is to not release any messages regarding IPO's until 20 days after the share float. However, the revelations that Facebook itself was unsure of its own figures and busines plan has led industry experts to question why the IPO occurred at all. 'When you have a significant change in your forecasts it's good business practice to postpone the IPO so that the market has more time to understand what's going on,' said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Indeed, following the depth of the bungled IPO, the SEC is continuing to probe an 'in depth review of all the participants' in the IPO said SEC Chairman Mary Shapiro in an interview in September. Cleaning up: Facebook's IPO has caused a mess . that is currently being investigated by the Senate Banking Committee, . two regulatory agencies and the state of Massachusetts . The Senate Banking Committee is also looking into the matter, and has held meetings “with a range of involved parties including Facebook, Nasdaq, Morgan Stanley (MS), and the SEC,” said Sam Gilford, press secretary for the Senate committee, in an e- mailed statement to Bloomberg News. So, while questions may be asked as to why the SEC allowed the Facebook IPO to go ahead, even with concerns, the heart of the matter is growing concern within the SEC over how it audits new high-tech consumer internet firms. Among the 92 of concern that the SEC brought to Facebook was the social networking giants reliance on Zynga, which makes the five most popular games played on Facebook, including 'Texas HoldEm Poker.' At first Facebook told the SEC that Zynga accounted for 12-percent of its 2011 revenue but after deeper questioning admitted that Facebook made almost one fifth of its revenue through Zynga. In addition, the SEC had to force Facebook to admit that Zynga could end up becoming a competitor. 'Zynga may choose to try to migrate users from existing Facebook-integrated games to other websites or platforms,' Facebook disclosed. Hyped: The Facebook IPO was one of the most widely-anticipated stock offers in recent history . As a result, 'Our financial results may be adversely affected,' it said. All answers to the SEC from Facebook were signed by Jeffrey Vetter, 46, of the Mountain View, California, law firm Fenwick & West. He declined to comment. The SEC also asked Facebook why it hadn’t included data on revenue generated by each user, a 'key' indicator of performance. Vetter dismissed the request on March 7, saying that the company prefers to look at 'overall growth in users' and 'overall revenue in evaluating the business.' Undeterred, the SEC carried out their own calculations, which made Facebook file the required figures. These showed revenue worldwide from each active user falling to $1.21 in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $1.38 in the fourth. They also revealed that per-user revenue was lowest in Asia, at just 53 cents down from 56 cents in the first quarter. Company executives did little to help their cause among shareholders during Facebook’s first months as a newly public company according to financial experts. 'There should be more public appearances by the CEO, there should be ongoing media relations activities that help give confidence to investors,' said Paul Argenti a professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business in Hanover, New Hampshire. 'I don’t see any of that going on. I see the exact opposite. It’s amateurish.'","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had to fight Facebook on 92 queries it had regarding plans for its May 2012 IPO which it filed on February 1st .

A racist thug who made a Nazi salute inside a packed pub and called black people c***s and n*****s was today jailed for almost two years and branded a ‘disgrace to the values of this country’. John Hennigan, 46, of Harlow, Essex, was caught on camera delivering the fascist gesture in front of shocked drinkers in February at The Magpie pub in Bishopsgate, central London. The antics put him in breach of an Asbo imposed in 2005 when a swastika was discovered daubed on the front door of his council house. It was the seventh time he had flouted the order. Racist: John Hennigan, 46, of Harlow, Essex, was caught on camera delivering the fascist gesture in front of shocked drinkers in February at The Magpie pub in Bishopsgate, central London . Hennigan claimed he had only been raising his arm to collect his change after paying for a drink, but was convicted by a majority verdict of 10-2 after a trial at the Old Bailey in central London. Sentencing Hennigan, Judge Nicholas Cooke QC told him the court was ‘not upholding some culture of political correctness’ but ‘preserving public order’ and dealing with unacceptable behavior. He added: ‘In this crowded public house in this city you gave a Nazi salute and spoke provocatively of Jews. The Holocaust was a crime against humanity of enormous magnitude. ‘Behaving in the way you did was appalling. You spoke of black people as c***s and n*****s. ‘The use of such terms is grossly offensive and conjures up memories of the slave trade, again a crime against humanity of enormous magnitude. Behaving in such a way was likewise appalling.’ The judge said Hennigan’s antics were also an affront to those who fought against the ‘racist evil of Nazism’ in the Second World War and ‘insults the memories of those who sacrificed themselves’. London pub: Hennigan had been barred from The Magpie in central London two times before but was spotted on CCTV by manager Paul MacAllion. 'He was making Nazi salutes at the bar,' the manager said . He added: ‘You see yourself as some sort of loyal nationalist or crusader against Communism. You are in fact a disgrace to the values of this country.’ Hennigan, who attended court wearing a T-shirt with an image of left-wing Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara with a line through it, told the judge ‘no probs’ as he was led away to the cells.

That was after he launched racist abuse at a newsagent before attacking him with a sweet display. Hennigan had been barred from The Magpie two times before but was spotted on CCTV by manager Paul MacAllion. ‘He was making Nazi salutes at the bar,’ the manager said . ‘I was trying to make sure it was the same guy I had barred, staring at the CCTV, and three times I saw him do it.

Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger has backed Boris Johnson to become Prime Minister, bringing some Hollywood glamour to the London Mayor’s hopes of one day getting the keys to Number 10. The former California governor hailed Mr Johnson as a ‘visionary’ with all the qualities needed to be a great leader. The fulsome endorsement is the latest chapter in the duo’s bizarre relationship, just a week after Mr Johnson described the blockbuster actor as an ‘Austrian cyborg’. Boris Johnson has been hailed as 'charming, funny and very clever' by his one-time foe Arnold Schwarzenegger. The pair rode Boris Bikes in London last year . The Tory party conference in Birmingham last week was dominated by speculation about Mr Johnson’s leadership ambitions. Mr Johnson used a speech to a ConservativeHome rally to repeat his swipe at Schwarzenegger's Austrian accent. Despite giving fulsome backing to David Cameron, the London Mayor also attacked government policy on tax, aviation and housing. Opinion polls have suggested the Conservative share of the vote would go up with Mr Johnson at the helm, although he has promised to serve his full second term as Mayor of London until 2016. Now Schwarzenegger has backed him to one day become Prime Minister for having the key skill in politics: likeability. ‘He has the qualities that are essential for a leader,’ Schwarzenegger told the Daily Telegraph. ‘For politicians, it’s all about personality. Boris is charming, he’s funny, and he’s very clever. ‘But also he is a visionary and he’s very likeable — and that’s really important in politics.’ In August the duo took a ride on the Emirates cable car from Greenwich to the ExCeL in Docklands, after watching the Olympic basketball in Greenwich . Schwarzenegger is in London promoting his new film, The Last Stand. During his publicity tour he has also warned the Prime Minister against trying to copy Mr Johnson’s populist appeal. ‘Cameron must not try to imitate Johnson,’ he told The Spectator. ‘It would be a disaster. Johnson is authentic. It has to be organic. Cameron must just be himself.’ It would be a 'disaster' if David Cameron tried to imitate Boris Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger also warned while promoting his film in London . The Schwarzenegger-Johnson love-in is the latest stage in their flourishing relationship, which got off to a bad start in 2007 when Schwarzenegger was caught on camera describing Mr Johnson’s speech as ‘fumbling’. A year later the Tory heavyweight got his revenge, declaring: ‘It was a low moment, my friends, to have my speaking style denounced by a monosyllabic Austrian cyborg.’ The pair patched things up in 2011 when they demonstrated the popular Boris Bikes on the streets of London. And in August this year the duo took a ride on the Emirates cable car from Greenwich to the ExCeL in Docklands after watching Olympic basketball.","The Terminator star and former California governor says Boris Johnson is a 'visionary' with all the qualities needed to be PM .

A trainee hairdresser whose boss offered her £10,000 for sex has won her claim of harassment. Maryam Mashayekhi's married manager Christopher Story made the indecent proposal in his car outside a hotel where they were styling hair for a wedding. Mrs Mashayekhi, 34, said the father of two systematically humiliated, bullied and sexually harassed her over a period of six months while she was working for him at Toni & Guy in Sheffield city centre. She said he questioned her about her sex life in front of colleagues, racially abused her and told a client she was a prostitute. 'Humiliated': Maryam Mashayekhi, left, claimed married father-of-two Christopher Story, right, handed her cash and then pushed her head towards his groin . Mrs Mashayekhi described how she . and Mr Story were waiting to style a bride’s hair on her . wedding day when he asked: ‘How much money do you want to have sex?’ She told him she would not do that for anyone because she was married. She said he then asked: ‘Are you . having sex for £1,000, what about £2,000 or £10,000?’ She responded: . ‘No, not even for £20,000. I love my husband.’ Later the same day, Mr Story pulled her head down towards his groin as if she was about to engage in a sexual act and gave her cash so an onlooker would believe she was a prostitute. Weeks into the job, Mr Story asked . about her sexual preferences in front of colleagues, she claimed. ‘I . was shocked,’ said Mrs Mashayekhi, who was born in Iran and came to . Britain in 2005. ‘I don’t know the culture but in my culture you are not . talking to people like that.’ She said the 39-year-old asked her in front of other staff: 'You are Iranian, do you do it doggy style as well?' The tribunal was told sexual . banter at the salon was commonplace. Mr Story said in a statement: ‘Many . of the staff are young and the topic of conversation can sometimes . relate to sex.’ 'Discrimination': Hairdresser Maryam Mashayekhi with her husband Manouchehr Royan. The couple have been married for eight years . Mrs Mashayekhi, who has been married . for eight years, worked on average 67 hours a week for low pay after . starting in the salon in May 2010, the Sheffield employment tribunal was told. The former artist said Mr Story called her ‘stupid’ on a . daily basis, knocking her self-confidence and leading to her eventually . leaving work with depression in November 2010. Mr . Story claimed she had marriage problems and thought her husband was . beating her. When she denied this, he replied: 'Asian men are aggressive . and don't respect women's rights.' He asked if she was claiming benefits and she replied that she had to make ends meet because her wages were so low. Mr Story replied: 'You're just like these Asians that come over here to claim benefits. You're just a scrounger like the rest of them.' The tribunal heard she was asked by a . businessman in the salon one evening what she did before working there . and Mr Story interjected with the comment: ‘She is a prostitute.’ Mr Story denied calling her a prostitute and said the wedding incident allegation was 'wildly inaccurate and extremely offensive' and he did not ask her if she had sex 'doggy style'. He said: 'I did not offer to pay her in return for sex nor did I push her head towards my groin.' Upmarket: Mrs Mashayekhi worked for Mr Story at this Toni & Guy salon in Sheffield city centre . The employment judge ruled that Mrs . Mashayekhi and her husband, who supported his wife at the hearing, were . 'close as a couple' and he accepted her evidence on the main complaints . of sex and race discrimination. The panel decided the boss had joked . in a 'wholly inappropriate way' over the 'indecent proposal' and the . claimant felt 'very angry, humiliated and helpless' over the groin . incident. Mr Story's comment that Asian men did not respect women's rights was 'stereotypical, untrue and inaccurate.' He had insulted her about her marriage, which was a happy one, used racial stereotypes, harassed her through a lack of discretion and bullied her by calling her work 'rubbish'. Mr Story had developed a 'cult of the personality' at the salon and was popular with staff and customers. 'Our analysis of his character and personality led us to the conclusion that he was quite capable of lewd conduct in jest but insensitive to the feelings of those to whom it was directed,' said the judge. The tribunal panel decided Mr Story's conduct 'violated her dignity' and created an 'offensive environment' for Mrs Mashayekhi. Employment Judge Sneath said: 'We find that coupled with the incidents of racial and sexual harassment the impact was to undermine the claimant's confidence and to sap her ability to withstand long hours of work so that she became ill and succumbed to depression.' Mr Story's conduct was 'calculated or likely to destroy mutual trust and confidence' and he concluded: 'He had no reasonable or proper excuse for his conduct nor could he.' Mrs Mashayekhi, who lives in Sheffield city centre, has already been awarded £1,057 by the tribunal for a shortfall in holiday pay and wages. The panel found George Plus One Ltd, the Toni and Guy franchise of which Mr Story's accountant wife Samantha is the sole director, constructively and unfairly dismissed the claimant and Mr Story was found guilty of sex and race discrimination. A remedy hearing will be held at a later date.","Maryam Mashayekhi, 34, said her boss Christopher Story, 39, made the offer while she was shadowing him at work .

"PUBLISHED: . 08:17 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:35 EST, 18 October 2012 . The heirs of Joe Schuster, pictured in 1976 with Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel, have been told they cannot reclaim copyright for the superhero. Heirs of one of Superman's creators have been have been told their claim to a stake in the copyright of the Man Of Steel was signed away decades ago. A judge has ruled descendents of Joe Schuster gave up their rights 20 years ago. This means DC Comics - who paid $412 for the superhero - will keep all rights to use the character in books, films, television and anywhere else they want to. This will include a new film set for next year,  expected to rake in millions. DC Comics sued artist Shuster's heirs in 2010 hoping a court would rule the family had lost their chance to reclaim copyright for the superhero in 1992. US District Court judge Otis Wright II did not disappoint them. He said Shuster's sister and brother relinquished the chance to reclaim Superman's copyright in exchange for annual pension payments from DC. Shuster created Superman with writer Jerry Siegel. He made his made his comic book debut in 1938 in Action Comics. Throughout their lives Siegel and Shuster fought for more cash for the part they played in bringing the world's most famous superhero to life. Siegel's heirs have also fought DC for a stake in copyrights to Superman. A judge said Shuster's brother and sister had given up any chance of a claim when they agreed to a bigger pension from DC. Siegel and Shuster fought for more cash for Superman when they were alive . DC Bought the rights to Superman and other creations for just $412. the actual cheque sold for $160,000 in an online auction . Shuster's family argued an agreement changing copyright interests would have been longer than the one-page agreement from 1992. This latest twist in Superman's legacy will be pounced on by some as the latest evidence of 'Superman's Curse.' This dates back to the creators being paid a pittance for their character. Misfortunes have also included illness and death. Adventures of Superman star George Reeves died of a gunshot wound under disputed circumstances. Lee Quigley - baby Superman in the 1978 movie - died of solvent abuse. Most famously Christopher Reeve was paralysed after a horse riding accident. That was between DC and Shuster's sister, Joan Shuster Peavy, and her brother, Frank. The family claimed copyright agreements could be nulled under laws allowing creators of work made before 1978 to reclaim rights. Judge Wright disagreed. He ruled Shuster's sister's decision to accept higher pension payments created a new agreement. The pre-1978 rights were now irrelevant. The Shuster's lawyer, Marc Toberoff, claimed 'we respectfully disagree' with the judge's 'factual and legal conclusions'. He said: 'It is surprising given that the judge appeared to emphatically agree with our position at the summary judgment hearing.' Warner Bros owns DC. It and the firm's lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, declined to comment.The new Superman movie, called 'Man of Steel' is expected to be released in 2013. Director Zach Snyder told fans this year at convention Comic-Con his film would make the superhero easier to relate to. He claimed previous depictions showed him as 'a big blue boy scout up on the throne and you can't really touch him.' In April, the $412 cheque DC wrote to buy Superman and other creations by Shuster and Siegel sold for $160,000 - almost £100,000 - in an online auction.","Descendants of creator told they lost chance to stake in superhero in 1992 .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 21:43 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:01 EST, 16 October 2012 . Dying patients who need hospital treatment in England cost the NHS an average of £7,415 each, a research report said yesterday. The bill covers care over the patient’s last year of life, and most of it is spent on emergency admission to hospital and then treatment in the final month, it found. The report by independent research group the Nuffield Trust put the total cost to hospitals and social services of looking after dying patients at just under £5 billion a year, with nearly two thirds of the bill falling to the NHS. Rising costs: Nearly two thirds of the £5million bill for caring for the dying is met by hospitals - with nearly two thirds of that cost falling to the NHS (posed by models) It said the finding raised the question of whether it would be cheaper for people to die outside hospital, adding ‘now more than ever this type of analysis is critical if more value is to be extracted from public funds.’ The inquiry comes at a time of growing controversy over the way hospitals routinely withdraw treatment from patients judged to be dying and allegations that the cost of caring for very seriously ill patents is one of the reasons why. NHS hospitals have adopted methods such as the Liverpool Care Pathway that are meant to ease the suffering of the dying during their last hours of life. But families have complained that LCP has been applied to patients who were not dying. One senior NHS consultant, Professor Patrick Pullicino, has said that predicting death in advance is not medically possible, that the Pathway has become a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, and that it is being used to free hospital beds or deal with difficult patients. The criticism suggests that the cost of treatment and care has become a factor in determining the way hospitals deal with the most severely ill and vulnerable patients. The Nuffield report, called Understanding Patterns of Health and Social Care at the End of Life, said costs for hospitals were much higher than for local councils because many more of the dying use hospitals than social care. Nearly half of all costs go on emergency admissions to hospital . Nearly nine out of 10 people in their last months of life go into hospital, but few more than a quarter use social care services. Overall, nearly two thirds of the total bill for caring for the dying is met by hospitals. But the report said that for each individual the cost of care of the dying in hospital was less than 60 per cent of the bill for local councils for social care of people in their last year of life, which covers both people in residential care homes and those who are given help to live in their own homes. Those who get social care in their last year of life on average cost the taxpayer £12,559, the report said. The costs are mainly spent helping people with low incomes because the care means test system means the better off have to pay their own care and care home bills, usually out of the value of their homes. The report said that extra spending on social care - for example by easing the means test system so homeowners are required to spend less of their assets on a care home place - could save hospitals money. Nuffield research head Dr Martin Bardsley said: ‘People are very vulnerable in the last months of their lives, and achieving appropriate and well-co-ordinated care across health and social care is critical. Our study suggests how social care might be effectively substituting for hospital care for this group of people. He warned that the Coalition and local authorities should not cut back on social care spending. ‘The worry is that if funding for social care is cut back, people may have no option but to use hospital care. This may not be the best care for people who wish to be at home in their last months of life, as well as cost far more for the NHS. ‘Given the financial climate, this type of analysis is critical now more than ever if more value for patients is to be extracted from public funds.’ The report, based on the care of 73,243 people in seven English cities, said that £486.6 million was spent on their hospital care and £255.3 million on their social care. ‘Many more people used hospital care than social care in the last year of life, and total hospital costs in this period were approximately double those of social care services,’ it said. Nearly half of all hospital costs were incurred by emergency inpatient admissions, and more than £2,000 of the cost of a hospital death was built up in the last month of life. ‘With this very large rise in activity towards the very end of life, over half of all hospital costs were due to activity in the last three months of life,’ the report said.","Total cost of looking after dying patients nearly £5 billion a .

A ‘possessed’ woman who was beaten with a walking stick in a home exorcism successfully begged a judge not to jail her husband even though he planned the black magic ceremony, a court heard today. Asma Hussain, 50, was tied to a bed, whipped and doused with holy water after family members became convinced her body was filled with demons. Wheelchair-bound Ahmed Hussain, 60, instigated the exorcism by a local Muslim imam and encouraged him to hit his wife harder 'to beat the demon out', Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. But today he was spared jail after his forgiving wife Asma asked for his freedom and said: 'It would be the end of my life if Ahmed lost his liberty.' Convicted: Asma Hussain loyally pushed her husband Ahmed in a wheelchair today after she begged a judge not to jail him for plotting her home exorcism . Holy water was also thrown on Mrs . Hussain during the eight-hour ordeal, also witnessed by Hussain’s son, . Mohammed Kayes Hussain, 28, and son-in-law Mohammed Aziz, 21. Hussain was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for two years and will also be supervised for a year. Mohammed Kayes Hussain was jailed for 12 months while Aziz was locked up for nine months. Asma suffered injuries to her hands and face including a bloody nose, and her back was described as ‘one massive bruise’ after the cruel attack, last January 7. But Mrs Hussain was unwilling to give evidence against her husband. She continues to play the role of husband’s loyal servant throughout the trial - pushing him to and from the court house in a wheelchair. Assault: . The victim's son-in-law Muhammed Aziz (left) was also found guilty of . taking part in the attack while a judge advised a jury not to convict . her daughter Salma, 22, (right) who had also faced charges . Mrs Hussain made an impassioned plea to Judge Neil Sanders urging him to be merciful when sentencing her husband and son. 'I don't believe Ahmed can cope with life if he loses . his liberty,' she wrote. 'Any prison sentence for Ahmed would be a prison sentence for me. 'It would be the end of my life if Ahmed lost his liberty.' ‘Mohammed Kayes has always been a good son and has shown me nothing but love and respect. ‘My family has already been blown apart by these proceedings. ‘Since his father’s health has declined considerably, I need my son’s help. ‘The fact is I have no one else to rely upon. In sending him to prison, it is me who will be punished.’ Family: . The victim's son, Mohammed Kayes Hussain (right) was also convicted, . while the jury was advised to find her daughter-in-law Halima Khatun . (left) not guilty . The alarm was raised after another daughter of Mrs Hussain visited and called paramedics, the court heard. Going home: The judge agreed that Ahmed Hussain needed his wife's care . Mrs Hussain had been suffering from stress due to caring for Ahmed Hussain, which was interpreted by the family as her being possessed, a police spokesperson said. The imam has mysteriously vanished. Sentencing, Judge Neil Sanders said: 'During the course of the attack, Mrs Hussain was screaming and was obviously in a great deal of pain. 'I'm quite satisfied that Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Ahmed Hussain were parties to the engagement of the imam. 'I accept that none of you knew the imam was going to resort to violence however by the jury's decision, evidence and having conducted the trial I am quite sure you were all party to this dreadful assault. 'You, Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Mohammed Aziz, held her down while she was being beaten and you, Ahmed Hussain, encouraged the imam in terms of words. 'You ignored the pleas of others who were present to stop what was happening. 'It's clear the imam struck the blows but whatever your beliefs, you were all party to this sustained assault. 'Mrs Hussain was vulnerable at the time, she had been acting strangely in the days leading up to the events but the assistance required was medical. 'I have carefully considered in each case whether I can suspend any sentence of imprisonment. 'In your cases, Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Mohammed Aziz, I have come to the conclusion that the seriousness of this offence merits an immediate sentence of imprisonment.' Ahmed Hussain, Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Aziz all denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm. But a jury of eight women and four men convicted the trio after deliberating for six hours and 24 minutes, following an eight day trial at the court last month. Allegations: Asma's husband Ahmed, 60, summoned the . local Muslim preacher to carry out the ceremony and encouraged him to . hit his wife harder, Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) was told . Prosecutor Babtunde Alabi told the jury the exorcism was performed at the family home in Bethnal Green, east London. ‘It appears that members of Asma Hussain’s family believed she was possessed by demons. ‘They also arranged for an imam to carry out an exorcism on her. ‘During the course of the exorcism, she was held down, had water poured all over her and was beaten with a cane. ‘For some unknown reason, it appears the defendants thought that Asma was possessed by a demon. ‘They claimed her behaviour had changed and her condition had deteriorated over a matter of weeks. ‘Faced with this seeming deterioration, they decided to deal with the matter by spiritual means. ‘Asma was tied to the bed while the imam prayed,’ Mr Alabi added. ‘The imam started beating Asma with her husband’s walking stick. ‘This was done, apparently, to ""beat the demon out”.' Ahmed Hussain, who sat outside the dock throughout the draped in a blanket due to his disability, refused to give evidence. Wearing traditional Muslim attire, Mohammed Kayes Hussain, who has previous convictions for drugs, dishonesty and assaulting a sister, also did not take to the witness box. Earlier, Judge Sanders directed the jury to clear the three men, together with Ahmed Hussain’s daughter, Salma, 22, and daughter-in-law Halima Khatun, 28, of false imprisonment. Salma Hussain and Khatun were also acquitted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the judge’s direction.","Asma Hussain was 'tied to a bed and covered with holy water after relations become convinced she was possessed'

Resignation: Andrew Mitchell MP looking very damp as he made his way home this afternoon just hours before sending his letter of resignation . Andrew Mitchell sensationally quit as David Cameron’s chief whip last night –  exactly a month after launching a foul-mouthed tirade at police officers in  Downing Street. Mr Mitchell travelled to Chequers at 4pm yesterday to tell the Prime Minister  he had lost the confidence of Tory MPs and was resigning immediately after just  six weeks in the job. The move came after senior ministers, including Theresa May, Iain Duncan Smith  and Mr Mitchell’s own deputy John Randall told him his position was untenable. His departure caps another dismal week for the Government, in which good news on unemployment was overshadowed by a shambolic announcement on energy bills and revelations last night that the Chancellor George Osborne had been caught  travelling in a first class rail carriage with a standard ticket. In an extraordinary resignation letter Mr Mitchell denied calling police officers ‘plebs’, as they have claimed, but admitted swearing at them, telling the Prime Minister he had said: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to ****ing  help us.’ This appears to contradict an appearance in the Commons earlier this week when he was seen mouthing the words ‘I didn’t swear’. He said in his letter: ‘Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we would both wish.’ Senior Tories were last night hoping his departure would draw a line under the damaging affair, which has revived the toxic suggestion that the party does not care about ordinary people. But it raises serious questions about the Prime Minister’s judgment in trying  to shield Mr Mitchell in the first place. Scroll down for Mitchell's resignation letter... and PM's response . Quit: The letter Mitchell sent to David Cameron as he handed in his resignation today . Denial: Despite his resignation Andrew Mitchell maintains that he didn't call a police officer a 'pleb' Calling for his head: Labour leader Ed Miliband had urged the Tories to sack Mitchell and even called for him to be arrested . Last night former Commons Leader Sir George Young was brought back into Cabinet as Chief Whip. The appointment will avert the need . for Mr Cameron to make other changes as Sir George does not currently . hold a ministerial post. The Tory grandee was thought to have . retired to the backbenches after giving up his position as Leader of the . House to make way for former health secretary Andrew Lansley. Sir George has been an MP since 1974 and held a variety of ministerial posts in the 1980s and 1990s. Mr Cameron had repeatedly defended Mr Mitchell, saying that although his outburst had been unacceptable, he had apologised. But the row refused to die down, with the Police Federation, Labour, and many Tories continuing to press for the Chief Whip to go. Theresa May and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith are understood to have been instrumental in Mr Mitchell’s departure. A Cabinet source said the pair had been ‘deeply unimpressed’ by his outburst. Mr Mitchell’s deputy John Randall was also a key figure in his downfall but other members of the whips’ office also made clear their unhappiness at  having to work under Mr Mitchell. ‘Andrew has had a succession of colleagues coming to him since Parliament  returned this week saying they think it would be difficult for him to go on,’  said the Cabinet source. A Downing Street source said: ‘The Prime Minister’s view of the original episode was that he had apologised, and most importantly the police officer concerned had accepted that apology. ‘But Andrew Mitchell had come to the conclusion that he was unable to continue to do his job properly, which is a different issue.’ Mr Mitchell’s resignation came exactly a month after he lost his temper with police officers who stopped him riding his bicycle out of the gates of Downing  Street. In a police report, the officer involved said Mr Mitchell  told him: ‘Best you learn your ****ing place. You don’t run this ****ing  government. You’re ****ing plebs.’ He then added: ‘You haven’t heard the last of this.’ In his resignation letter he maintained that his outburst had not been as bad as portrayed. The Prime Minister said he was ‘sorry’ to lose Mr Mitchell but understood why he was leaving. Michael Dugher MP, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister said: ‘What  people will want to know is why, when the entire country could see that what Andrew Mitchell did was wrong, the Prime Minister totally failed to act.' Dear David, . It is with enormous regret - not least because of the tremendous support and loyalty you have shown me during recent weeks - that I am writing to resign as your Chief Whip. Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we both would wish. Nor is it fair to continue to put my family and colleagues through this upsetting and damaging publicity. I have made clear to you - and I give you my categorical assurance again - that I did not, never have, and never would call a police officer a ""pleb"" or a ""moron"" or used any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me. The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark ""I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us"". It was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and I am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology. I am immensely grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your Development Secretary for seven and a half years, both in Opposition and in Government. I believe Britain, under your leadership, has made real progress in transforming the lives and the opportunities of some of the world's poorest people and that we will continue to do so as we deploy an expertise and commitment which show Britain at its best. I now intend to concentrate on serving my constituents in the Royal town of Sutton Coldfield to the best of my ability and giving you the strong support you rightly deserve from all members of the Conservative Party. With every good wish, . yours ever, . Andrew Mitchell. Dear Andrew, . Thank you for your letter. I was sorry to receive it, but I . understand why you have reached the conclusion that you have, and why you have . decided to resign from the Government. I regret that this has become necessary, and am very . grateful for all you have done, both in Government and in Opposition - as well . as for the kind words in your letter. I am in no doubt that your work in the field of . international development has made a really important contribution - not only . to the Conservative Party, but more importantly to Britain's standing in the . world, and above all to international efforts to tackle deep and sustained . poverty. You brought real passion to the job in Opposition, which you . turned into more than two years of very successful work in Government. You brought immense energy and dedication to the role, a . focus on the world's poorest, and decisive progress on the key issues of . vaccination against preventable diseases, maternal health and family planning . that make the greatest difference to the greatest number of people. You have also brought a proper accountability and . transparency to the Department for International Development's work. Under your leadership of the Department, Britain achieved a . leading global role, which will be continued as Britain chairs the United . Nations High Level Panel. As we discussed in advance of the reshuffle, I wanted you to . bring your organisational skill and energy to the important job of Chief Whip. It was clear to me that you had already made a strong start. As you have acknowledged, the incident in Downing Street was . not acceptable and you were right to apologise for it. You have much to be proud of from your service on the . Frontbench both in Opposition and in Government, and in your continued service . to your constituents in Sutton Coldfield.

Police in Brazil had to break up a crowd of angry dog owners after images of their pets being tortured in a grooming centre were broadcast on TV, it was reported today. The Quatro Patas pet shop offered a wash and grooming service for dogs in Rio de Janeiro. Many clients told how they would take their beloved pets for a pampering session every week because they believed staff at the store treated the animals so well. Torture: The member of staff, identified as Daniel Barroso, the son of the owner, ties up a dog's snout before forcing water down its nose . But secretly recorded footage shows a worker, identified as the son of the store's owner, repeatedly punching and beating the dogs as he bathes them. Daniel Barroso, 20, is also seen hitting the animals over the head with objects, violently banging their heads against the wall, and tying up their feet and snouts before forcing water down their noses. The video was shot by an anonymous witness, who claims she became outraged by the daily torture of pets in the establishment. She told Brazil's RJTV: 'The aggression and mistreatment was constant and the animals cried with pain. Some left the room injured and traumatised by the beatings.' Animal abuse: Mr Barroso lifts his hand to strike the cream coloured dog he is meant to treat to a pampering . Horror: This moment in the video shows the young man beating friendly labrador Thor with a shampoo bottle, repeatedly hitting him over the head . In one of the most shocking scenes, a black labrador called Thor, known for being gentle, receives punches and blows for the duration of his bath. Barroso is seen striking the five-year-old dog with a bottle of shampoo and knocking his head against the wall, even though he never reacts to the aggression. After seeing the video, the dog's owner, Vera Fernandes, said: 'I'm absolutely horrified. I took him there every week, it was his treat. 'I never imagined something like this could ever have happened there.' Canine nightmare: Owners of the dogs seen in the video visited Quatro Patas, which is Portuguese for Four Paws, trying to vandalise the shop . The owner of a crossbreed called Pink, . which is seen being thrown into the bath and having water forced into . its muzzle, cried as she said: 'I can't bear to see it. I never . suspected anything. The owner of the shop seemed like a lovely woman. Distraught: Vera Fernandez said she took labrador Thor to the pet shop every week as a treat . 'I want justice for my dog and I'll be taking them to court.' Police were called yesterday afternoon to the city's northern district of Engenho de Dentro after enraged owners of other dogs seen being maltreated in the video tried to smash the store's windows. The shop's owner, Solange Barroso, insisted she had no idea about the abuse, even though she is seen at some points in the video. She said: 'They are things that happen in one moment which I didn't have knowledge of. 'That's all I can say. I want to say a thousand sorrys because, really, I have nothing else to say.' Authorities in Rio de Janeiro confirmed today they have temporarily suspended the pet shop's licence. A police spokesman today said an investigation has been opened into the abuse claims. If convicted Daniel Barroso could received a six-month jail sentence. VIDEO: Warning graphic content.

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 14:06 EST, 19 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:06 EST, 19 October 2012 . A solo cyclist was the first victim of the Alpine gun massacre – and not the British al-Hilli family. The hugely significant development throws the focus of the entire investigation back on to 45-year-old Sylvain Mollier, a Frenchman who was hit by up to seven bullets in the attack in eastern France. Mr Mollier, who worked in the nuclear industry, died in an isolated wooden lay by near Lake Annecy on September 5. New developments: Investigators now believe French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was killed before the Al-Hilli family . Until now he was regularly described by detectives as ‘collateral damage’ to what looked like the professional assassination of Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf. All were all found dead in the family BMW in an attack which left Mr Al-Hilli’s seven year old daughter Zainab severely wounded, and his four-year-old Zeena traumatised. But the latest ballistic report into the atrocity reveals that Mr Mollier was the first to be attacked. Forensic examinations of the soles of victims’ shoes combined with a detailed analysis of bullet trajectories reveal that Mr Al-Hilli was outside the car with Zainab while the gunman was targeting Mr Mollier. Burial: Relatives of Sylvain Mollier at Ugine Funeral Home after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation . Mr Al-Hilli is said to have been ‘surprised’ by what he saw, and tried to get back into the car, where the rest of the family were waiting. But, in his haste and panic, Mr Al-Hilli reversed the BMW into a muddy bank where the rear axle of the estate car got stuck. Violent killings: Aerospace engineer Saad Al-Hilli from Surrey, was murdered in a suspected assassination alongside his wife and mother-in-law . It was then that the killer shot him repeatedly in the head, and also used a semi-automatic gun to murder his mother and mother-in-law, sitting in the back seat of the  car. The assassin then returned to ‘finish the cyclist off’, said an investigating source who made details of the ballistics report public. The report also shows that the cyclist’s body was moved at some point. The long waited report appears to confirm that just one gunman was involved in the attack, and that he turned from ‘one victim to another in quick succession’. Police now believe that this modus operandi suggests the work of an amateur, rather than a ‘professional assassin’. A month ago Mr Mollier’s body was ‘temporarily buried’ in a secret ceremony, even though this went against the wishes of his family, who had asked for him to be cremated. Thirty people attended the funeral, which took place in a closed burial site which was deliberately kept hidden from the media. French investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘double life’ and been the intended target of the shooting. Mr Mollier worked for Cezus, a subsidiary of the Areva Group, specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers. He had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his new partner, a pharmacist, gave birth in June. French police inspect a drain under the road to the murder scene at Cheverlaine during their investigations . Mr Mollier was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside. Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute . with his brother, Zaid, over their father’ s will, and had changed the . locks on the family home before they went on holiday to keep his sibling . out. Mr Al-Hilli also kept an illegal Taser defence weapon at home – . suggesting that he lived in fear of attack. Both Zainab and Zeena are now back in Britain and being kept at a secret location. Brett Martin, a 53-year-old Englishman who used to be in the RAF, was . the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle. The family left their Europa campsite after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy .

It is one of the strangest photographs returned from Mars yet - giving a snapshot of what Mars was like when it had a dynamic surface. The small spherical objects in this image from Opportunity - still scouring the surface of Mars after nearly 10 years on the Red Planet - are tiny mineral-rich nodules, nicknamed 'blueberries' by NASA, which are sticking out of the face of a crater. Now the Opportunity has been joined by the Curiosity - but the older brother is still proving its worth, capturing the geological formations which show how Mars was once a wet world with surface water. The 'spherules' are small - only three millimetres across each - and have been magnified for this image, which shows an area only 2.4inches (6 centimeters) across. They appeared on an outcrop called 'Kirkwood' in the Cape York segment of the western rim of Endeavour Crater. Martnan 'blueberries': This is a 2.4inches (6cms) patch of outcrop on the western rim of Endeavour Crater. The individual spherules are up to about three millimeters in diameter . The Microscopic Imager took the . component images during the 3,064th Martian day of Opportunity's travels . - September 6th by Earth time. Opportunity discovered spherules at . its landing site more than eight-and-a-half years earlier, and they were . promptly nicknamed 'blueberries'. They provided important evidence . about long-ago wet environmental conditions on Mars because researchers . using Opportunity's science instruments identified them as concretions . rich in the mineral 'hematite', which was deposited by water saturating . the bedrock. However these spherules are different . - they do not have the iron-rich composition of the blueberries, and . also differ in concentration, distribution and structure. Some of the spherules in this image have been partially eroded away, revealing concentric internal structure. Landscape: Opportunity captured this image of rock fins near Kirkwood in July . Opportunity's science team plans to . use the rover for further investigation of these spherules to determine . what evidence they can provide about ancient Martian environmental . conditions. Opportunity’s principal investigator, Steve Squyres of Cornell University, said: 'This is one of the most extraordinary pictures from the whole mission. Self-portrait: This picture shows Opportunity casting a shadow on the rim of Endeavour Crater . 'Kirkwood is chock full of a dense . accumulation of these small spherical objects. Of course, we immediately . thought of the blueberries, but this is something different. We never . have seen such a dense accumulation of spherules in a rock outcrop on . Mars.' The Martian blueberries found . elsewhere by Opportunity are concretions formed by action of . mineral-laden water inside rocks, evidence of a wet environment on early . Mars. Concretions result when minerals . precipitate out of water to become hard masses inside sedimentary rocks. Many of the Kirkwood spheres are broken and eroded by the wind. Where . wind has partially etched them away, a concentric structure is evident. Opportunity used the microscopic . imagern its arm to look closely at Kirkwood. Researchers checked the . spheres’ composition by using an instrument called the Alpha Particle . X-Ray Spectrometer on Opportunity’s arm. Squyres added: 'They seem to be . crunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle.,They are different in . concentration. They are different in structure. They are different in . composition. They are different in distribution. 'So, we have a wonderful geological . puzzle in front of us. We have multiple working hypotheses, and we have . no favorite hypothesis at this time. It’s going to take a while to work . this out, so the thing to do now is keep an open mind and let the rocks . do the talking.' Just past Kirkwood lies another science target area for Opportunity. The location is an extensive . pale-toned outcrop in an area of Cape York where observations from orbit . have detected signs of clay minerals. That may be the rover’s next study . site after Kirkwood. Four years ago, Opportunity departed Victoria . Crater, which it had investigated for two years, to reach different . types of geological evidence at the rim of the much larger Endeavour . Crater.

Watchdogs have ruled that a TV ad featuring a naked man strolling through the countryside wearing nothing but a cap was not offensive. The commercial for Richmond ham was supposed to be a light-hearted attempt to present the product as natural and wholesome. However, it drew 370 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) from shocked viewers with many arguing it was both offensive and unsuitable to be seen by children. Natural look: The nude picknickers in the advertisment that prompted 370 complaints . The TV ad showed the man standing in a field admiring a sandwich before strolling past a group of naked people who were eating a picnic. As he walked, the man sang: ‘Oh Richmond ham, as nature intended, you've nothing to hide Richmond ham, to me you taste blooming splendid.’ A voice-over then added: ‘New Richmond ham. Britain's only ham made with 100 per cent natural ingredients.’ The company said the ad demonstrated a ‘well-adjusted, comfortable, and completely non-sexual attitude to the human body’, while surveys with mums had received a positive response.

The company said the advert demonstrated a 'well adjusted, comfortable and completely non-sexual attitude to the human body' The ASA accepted that defence and said customers would understand the 'light-hearted reference' Misleading: The ASA took issue with the fact that the ham was made in Ireland and not Britain . That defence has been accepted by the ASA in a ruling published today. The watchdog said: ‘Consumers would understand that it was a light-hearted reference to the product being 'as nature intended'. ‘Whilst we understood the ad may not appeal to everyone, we considered that it was not sexual in tone and we concluded that it was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence.’ But, while the ASA was happy with the nudity, it has decided to ban the commercial on the basis it gave a misleading impression about where the ham was made. For while the advertisement described it has ‘Britain’s only ham made with 100 per cent natural ingredients’, the product is actually made in Ireland by Kerry Foods. The ASA said: ‘Whilst we accepted the ad did not refer directly to the provenance of the product, we considered that describing the product as Britain's only ham was likely to be interpreted by consumers as meaning the product was British in origin, when in fact that was not the case. ‘We therefore concluded that the claim was misleading.’","Advert drew 370 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)

Shocked investment bankers learnt they had lost their jobs yesterday – when they were refused entry to their offices. Traders at financial services firm UBS said they arrived for work in the morning to find their security passes wouldn’t work. A source claims the dramatic steps . were taken amid fears employees might squander vast sums of the . company’s money in ‘kamikaze’ spending sprees if they knew they were . about to lose their jobs. Scroll down for video . UBS, which has around 6,500 staff in its London office (pictured), said the restructuring would deliver savings of 5.4 billion Swiss francs . The redundancies came as part of a worldwide cull of 10,000 staff at Swiss banking giant UBS. More than 1,000 London-based staff are . expected to be axed in one of the biggest bank layoffs since Lehman . Brothers went bankrupt at the start of the financial crisis four years . ago. The first 100 British-based traders to lose their jobs discovered their fate when they turned up at work yesterday. Human resources staff clutching . clipboards led them from the building’s reception into meeting rooms, . where they were told they were being put on ‘special leave’ on full pay . while the terms of their redundancies were worked out. A source said bosses could not risk . allowing them to get to their desks and start trading huge sums of the . company’s money on the stock market knowing they were due be laid off. One trader based at the  bank’s . offices in Liverpool Street said: ‘We all knew it was coming because . there have been various stories in the press, but I don’t think anyone . expected it to be as brutal as it was. UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti called the decision a 'difficult one' ‘Basically some people turned up to . the building and found their passes weren’t working – that’s how they . found out they were sacked. ‘They were just kind of ushered off into side rooms by these HR people with clipboards and told that that was it. ‘They weren’t even allowed up to the trading floors to clear their desks. It was horrendous. ‘Even for those of us who haven’t been . sacked it’s really upsetting. It makes you think twice about whether . you want to work for a company like that anyway. I  suppose there’s no . good way of doing it but whatever the best way is, it certainly wasn’t . this. It’s no way to treat people.’ The mass redundancies come  just a . year after it emerged the bank had lost £1.4billion following alleged . illicit dealing by former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli, who is currently . standing trial. But UBS blamed the job losses on . tougher financial regulation in the aftermath of the global economic . crisis, which has made investment banking less profitable. The Zurich-based bank plans to cut . staff from 64,000 to 54,000 globally by 2015, with three-quarters of the . job losses expected to be made in London, the US and Asia. The company’s chief executive Sergio . Ermotti said: ‘This decision has been a difficult one, particularly in a . business such as ours that is all about its people. Some reductions . will result from natural attrition and we will take whatever measures we . can to mitigate the overall effect. ‘Throughout the process we will ensure that our people will be supported and treated with care.’ However, UBS denied deactivating the security passes of staff being made redundant before they arrived at work. The bank, which has around 6,500 staff in London, said the job cuts would save £3.5billion by 2015. The cull follows a 40 per cent plunge in its pre-tax operating profits to £1.5billion in the six months to June 30. UBS claimed the fall was caused by the . botched stock market listing of social network Facebook, which cost the . bank £227million. It blamed the loss on the ‘gross mishandling’ of the . flotation by Nasdaq, which involved a series of technical errors that . caused a delay in the start of trading of Facebook shares in May. Former UBS banker Adoboli is accused . of gambling away £1.4billion during the financial crisis, in the UK’s . biggest ever fraud trial.

A flower shop seller has told how he came face-to-face with 'John Doe Duffle Bags' serial killer Salvatore Perrone. Luis Reyes, 42, was working the register at New Events Flower Shop in Brooklyn, New York, when the man charged with killing of three shopkeepers walked in last week. 'I feel lucky. It's surprising. That kind of person is crazy. You never know what they can do,' Mr Reyes told the New York Daily News. Scroll down for videos . Is this 'John Doe Duffel Bags'? Salvatore Perrone, a businessman from Staten Island, has been named in connection with the Brooklyn murders . 'He was walking slow, just looking . into all the stores,' Mr Reyes added. 'I thought he was one of those . guys that begs for money.' Salvatore Perrone, 63, of Staten Island, has confessed to two of the killings after turning himself in to police. Officers said he put himself at all three scenes but his motive is still unclear. Before police knew his . identity, the suspect was dubbed the 'John Doe Duffel Bags' for the bag . that he was seen carrying the most recent attack, which . was visible in surveillance videos. Perrone carried clothing in the duffel bag, which he had tried to tried to sell to the shopkeepers, police said. NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly on Wednesday called Perrone a 'serial killer' who is likely to have continued the murder spree. 'I think it's reasonable to assume . that he was going to continue doing this, and, by arresting him, we . saved lives,' Commissioner  Kelly said. Weapon: Police say that Perrone used this rifle to kill three New York shop keepers . 'We know that he went to other locations and . asked questions that indicated that. Now that we look at them, he may . very well have been planning to come back.' NYPD spokesman Paul Browne echoed Commissioner Kelly's sentiment, saying Perrone did not show signs of stopping the mayhem on his own. 'There was some concern he may have targeted another merchant,' Mr Browne said. The realization that the alleged sawed-off psycho was mere steps away sent chills through Reyes' veins. 'It's surprising. I bet those people (who he shot) didn't think anything was going to happen, either,' Reyes said. Police recovered a bag containing a . sawed-off rifle believed to have been used in the killings. The other . killings happened in July and August. All three shopkeepers were men . alone in stores that had no video cameras. After being questioned by detectives . for hours, Peronne admitted to the slayings of Mohammed Gebeli, 65, . in Bay Ridge and Isaac Kadare, 59, in Bensonhurst. In the most recent killing, . Rahmatollah Vahidipour, an Iranian, was shot three times in the head and . chest at his store, the She She Boutique. After that killing, detectives . discovered the same gun was used in the fatal shootings of two other . shopkeepers when ballistics matched the .22-caliber gun shell casings on . all three. On July 6, Gebeli, an Egyptian, was found shot in . the back of his shop, Valentino Fashion Inc. On August 6, Kadare, . also Egyptian, was shot in the head in his store, Amazing 99 Cent Deal. The suspect was taken into police custody after he voluntarily entered the 68th Precinct in Bay Ridge. He was . later transferred to another police location for additional questioning. Revealed: The balding, mustachioed man dubbed 'John Doe Duffle Bags' who was seen near at least two crime scenes in Brooklyn voluntarily submitted himself for questioning . Ballistics tests matched in each killing, all of which occurred in Brooklyn shops with an '8' in the address. Peronne was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the Flatbush store where Rahmatollah Vahidipour was killed on last Friday evening. Minutes later, the same moustachioed-man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store. Murdered: Vahidipour Rahmatollah was killed with three gunshots, but it seems nothing was stolen . The New York Post reports that a different surveillance camera, located by the scene of the second murder in Bensonhurst also shows the same man. The video is of poorer quality, but they feel confident that the same duffel bag-toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper Isaac Kadare was killed on August 2. ‘”John Doe Duffel Bag” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag,’ police commissioner Ray Kelly said. ‘He was seen in the vicinity of Vahidipour’s store just after 6pm. The shop owner’s body was found at 7.11pm.’ This is not the first person-of-interest in the case, and a number have since been ruled out. Previously unidentified suspects, dubbed ‘Jane Doe Green Jacket’ and ‘John Doe Bubble Jacket’, were on the police’s watch list since they were seen in the area of Vahidipour’s shop at the time of the murder. They have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘Green Jacket’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘Bubble Jacket’ who was chasing after her following the theft. Two remaining possibilities are ‘Jane Doe Long Coat’, a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf. Looking for the man: He appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months . Near the scene: None of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside . There also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left Mohammed Gebeli dead on July 6. That possible suspect was a man with . dark skin and wearing sunglasses, who witnesses described as being . ‘disturbed’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone’s . head. That man is said to be roughly 5ft 5in and around 140lbs. The Daily News reports that the shop owner Vahidipour of Great Neck was behind the counter of She She in Brooklyn's . Flatbush section when he was shot. The gunman . dragged the victim's body toward the back of the store and covered it . with clothing. Victims: Isaac Kadare and Mohammed Gebeli were killed by the same handgun earlier this year . Police found the 78-year-old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso, DNA Info reported. On . the floor of the shop were the killer's calling card: shell casings . matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides. 'Now it's like he's telling us, 'It's me again,'' a police source told the New York Daily News. casings that police have matched to two other murders. “Now it’s like he’s telling us, ‘It’s me again,’ ” a police source said. The way Rahmatollah's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings. On July 6, Mohammed Gebeli, 65, was found shot through the neck in his Bay Ridge clothing shop. His body was also hidden. Police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies. 'I hope they catch the son of a b****,' Gebeli's son, Mourad said. When Rahmoatollah didn't come home at the usual time Friday his family called the police, who discovered his body. It wasn't not clear if the killer actually took anything, or if the murder was his sole motivation. 'He never had in his whole life one enemy, he didn't have, he was a very . kind man,' his sobbing wife, Naima Rahmatollah, told reporters. Suspect: Following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun, police released this sketch of the suspect . He was supposed to be at his grandson’s Bar Mitzvah last Saturday. Police believe the murderer had been . watching the store in preparation for the attack, noting that he'd . chosen a shop with no security cameras. Issac Kadare, 59, was found dead in his Bensonhurst store at 1877 . 86th Street, was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck. Besides owning stores, each victim was of Middle Eastern descent, prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated. It appeared nothing was taken from Rahmatollah's shop but both Kadare and Gebeli had money taken from them, and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive. Unguarded: believe the killer was attracted to the store because, as with previous crime scenes, there were no cameras . Fernando Mateo, of the Bodega Association of the U.S., said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim's description. 'The only members that we would be concerned about are Middle Easterners,' he said. It's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology, as the address for each homicide includes the number 8: Kadare at 1877 86th Streer, Gebeli at 7718 5th Avenue, and Rahmatollah at 834 Flatbush Avenue. None of the stores had working surveillance cameras. Scene: Police believe the killer may have been casing the shop, as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act . Neighbors called Rahmoatollah a 'neighborhood staple.' 'He was a regular guy,' said customer Xanius Patterson. 'He never hurt nobody.'

"His next film role in Thin Man is delayed because actor 'needs a break' By . Amelia Proud and Kimberley Dadds . PUBLISHED: . 02:57 EST, 22 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:15 EST, 22 June 2012 . He confirmed to the world he's split from Vanessa Paradis after 14 years together earlier this week. And Johnny Depp is ensuring he takes his mind off the break-up and intense scrutiny into his love life doing what he does best. The Pirates of the Caribbean star has thrown himself back into work, attempting to hide from the crowds deep in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. First sighting: Johnny Depp is spotted for the first time since announcing his split from Vanessa Paradis on set of The Lone Ranger in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado . Johnny, 49, was spotted in full character on set of The Lone Ranger yesterday. He wore full Native American face paint with a headscarf and was shirtless as he walked along with a crew member. The actor has been working steadily on the film and as yet has made no comment following recent events regarding his private life. Taking a break: The actor almost looked unrecognisable in full face paint as he walked along with a crew member while still dressed in character . Back to work: The Hollywood star is concentrating on filming his role as Native American tribe member Tonto in his latest film . However, it seems that the problems for Depp are not confined to his personal life. Filming on his next movie the Thin Man has been delayed. The remake of the 1934 comic detective film was set to star Depp as retired detective Nick Charles, with Rob Marshall directing. But Deadline.com reports the studio are willing to put the project on hold so Depp can take a break, so Marshall has pulled out. Also Warner Bros were said to have been unhappy with the box office performance of his last release the Tim Burton movie Dark Shadows, which only earned a slim profit margin following mixed reviews. Since Depp's split from Vanessa was confirmed, revelations regarding the actor's closeness to other women have emerged. Close: It's been reported that Johnny Depp and his publicist Robin Baum formed a relationship that went beyond work . Not only has it been reported that . he's growing closer to his Rum Diary star Amber Heard, it's also being . claimed that Depp was spending time with other beautiful women as his 14 . year union with Paradis crumbled. Be-Witched: Johnny described Dark Shadows co-star Eva Green as a 'different level of human' Depp . was forced to deny rumours that he was involved with his Dark Shadows . co-star Eva Green who he shared a sensational, supernatural love scene . with in the Tim Burton film. But a report suggests that he has struck up a more serious bond with his pretty publicist, Robin Baum. 'Robin and Johnny spend a lot of time together obviously because of work but their relationship seems to be getting much closer than just business,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'Robin is twice divorced and a mom but she and Johnny really seem to have some kind of crazy connection that goes way beyond a professional level. 'They travel a lot together for work and get to spend a lot of time together and they definitely have a total flirty vibe between them. I would put money on them having more than just a friendly relationship.' They added that Johnny's French . partner Paradis was aware of the close relationship between her partner . and Robin... and wasn't happy about it. 'She . knew that Johnny and Robin were together a lot and she didn’t like it, . but there was nothing she could do because it was a working relationship . she was told,' the source said. But . currently, bisexual actress Heard, 26, is a 'regular visitor' to the . New Mexico set of The Lone Ranger where Depp is currently filming. And . Johnny, who made an official . announcement that he had split from partner of 14 years Vanessa Paradis . on Tuesday, is even said to have bought Heard a horse so they can ride . together, according to a report in Globe magazine. On set: As the speculation about his love life heightens, Johnny is staying in the Rocky Mountains as he films more scenes . A source claims Depp is smitten by . the Hitchcock blonde, and reportedly said: 'When I first saw Amber, it . was like seeing an old-time movie star like Lauren Bacall.' The American actress who was born in Austin, Texas, previously worked as a model and before starring in The Rum Diary, had had small roles in a number of films. She attended a Catholic school in Austin until her junior year, then the ambitious teen left to pursue a career in Hollywood. Heard was active in her school's drama department and appeared in local commercials and campaigns. More than friends? Amber has been visiting Johnny on the New Mexico set of The Lone Ranger, it has been reported . On screen romance: Depp and Heard seen in a scene from movie The Rum Diary . While she was raised a Catholic, after the death of her best friend died in a car crash Heard declared herself an atheist. Heard has described her role as Johnny Depp's love interest in the film, The Rum Diary, as 'the best experience of my life'. She gushed to magazine Dazed about Depp: 'He’s such a wonderful presence; he is enigmatic and compelling and a true artist, seriously intelligent and incredibly sensitive. 'Everybody on set respects and likes him, which says a lot about an actor. It’s a gruelling job at times and the stress level that everybody feels in the industry is intense – but it doesn’t affect Johnny. 'It seems like he has time to look everybody in the eye and I like that, it was wonderful to see.' The 26-year-old actress's profile is . set to rise as she recently joined the case of  thriller Paranoia as the . female lead alongside Gary . Oldman, Harrison Ford, and Liam Hemsworth. She also recently . landed a role as an assassin in the sequel Machete Kills. Vanessa and Johnny had not been . pictured together in public for months, but the Dark Shadows star . insisted last month that there was no truth to talk of a split. 'The rumours are not true,' he told The Sun newspaper. 'They are absolutely not true.' 'No matter what I say about this, people believe the opposite. I can’t say enough about it not being over,' he said. It's over: Depp's spokesperson finally ended months of speculation by revealing that Depp and Paradis, seen here in 2010, had split . Despite . Johnny's denials, a number of publications carried pictures and reports . that he and Heard enjoyed a trip together to Las Vegas on a private . plane. Depp was in town promoting Dark Shadows, and Vanessa was nowhere to be seen. It's unclear why Amber was in the gambling town. Amber was alleged to have joined Johnny in Vegas, and was pictured boarding his private plane the next day. Johnny and Vanessa have declined to appear at their respective premieres and public events together recently, with the French actress attending her premiere, of Café de Flore in Paris alone, and not accompanying the actor on promotional duties for Dark Shadows. They are parents to Lily Rose,12, and ten-year-old Jack. Romance?

Researchers also discovered that mental perks associated with pregnancy were negated by chronic stress. Lead author Doctor Benedetta Leuner said the findings increased understanding of postnatal depression which was a 'devastating' condition. New findings: Mothers who experience chronic stress during pregnancy are more likely to suffer from depression (posed by model) Dr Leuner said rat mothers, not exposed to stress, showed an increase in brain cell connections in regions associated with learning, memory and mood. In contrast, the brains of mother rats that were stressed twice a day - by being put in water or having their mobility restricted - did not show this increase. Researchers looked at the rats' dendritic spines - hair-like growths on brain cells that are used to exchange information with other neurons and found they increased almost 20 per cent in new mothers. The boost improves cognitive functioning, especially multitasking. The rats that were stressed show no boost in dendritic spines and also had less physical interaction with their babies. This behaviour is observed in human mothers who experience postnatal depression. Making progress: Researchers believe the findings could help to understand postnatal depression (posed by model) Dr Leuner, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at Ohio State University in the United States, said: 'Animal mothers in our research that are unstressed show an increase in the number of connections between neurons. Stressed mothers don't. 'We think that makes the stressed mothers more vulnerable. They don't have the capacity for brain plasticity that the unstressed mothers do, and somehow that's contributing to their susceptibility to depression. And they were not very good mothers. 'After separation from pups for 30 minutes, unstressed mothers would gather up their babies, put them in the nest and nurse them. 'Stressed mother rats left the pups scattered around, wandered around the cage and fed the babies less frequently. 'The stressed mother rats also exhibited more floating than unstressed rats in a water test; animals that float rather than swim are showing depressive-like symptoms. 'These findings in rats mimic some of the symptoms that are seen in women with postpartum depression,' Leuner said. Dr Leuner described the research during a talk in New Orleans at Neuroscience 2012, the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. She said postpartum depression was a devastating condition and understanding it better may help prevent some of its damaging effects. 'It's devastating not only for the mother, because it affects her well-being, but previous research also has shown that children of depressed mothers have impaired cognitive and social development, may have impaired physical development, and are more likely as adults to have depression or anxiety,' she said. 'A better understanding of postpartum depression is important to help the mother but also to prevent some of the damaging effects that this disorder can have on the child.'","Those stressed twice a day showed 'depressive-like symptoms'

No stopping him: Jacob Edwards took his first steps just after his first birthday . A baby who  suffered a massive stroke after a 'ticking time bomb' of malformed blood vessels burst in his brain, has made a miraculous recovery. Jacob Edwards fell ill when he was just two weeks old. He was rushed to hospital where surgeons had to perform a risky operation to remove a blood clot from his brain to reduce the pressure. However, they were unable to remove all of it because it was too deep in Jacob’s brain. His parents Hayley Leon and Lee . Edwards, from Coventry, were warned it could burst again and their son . may be left with with brain damage. But doctors were left stunned when a brain scan showed the venous anomaly had vanished. Now Jacob, 15 months, has beat the odds by learning to walk and talk - something his parents feared he may never do. Hayley, 30, said: 'It’s amazing. We’re so proud of him. Not a day goes by when I don’t think about what happened. It could have been so different. 'We were very close to losing him.' Jacob seemed healthy when he was born in July last year. But when he was two weeks old, he woke up screaming and vomiting. The . couple, who also have two older sons, Callum, 11, and five-year-old . Jack, immediately took him to University Hospital, Coventry, where . doctors thought he had gastroenteritis. Hayley . said: 'Jacob was getting worse by the hour. He was slipping in and out . of consciousness. Lee noticed his left eye was lifeless. 'He asked the doctors to check it and that’s when they knew something was seriously wrong. 'They did a CT scan and told us they had found a bleed on his brain. Lee and I didn’t know what to say. It’s not something that happens to you. It happens to other people. We were in total shock.' Jacob was placed on a life support machine before being rushed to Birmingham Children’s Hospital for more specialist care. Full time mother Hayley said: 'A special ambulance came to pick him up. We weren’t allowed to go with him because there wasn’t enough room. 'It was horrible leaving him. I just wanted to be with him and to make him better. 'When we got there, they took him for an MRI scan. We were taken into a side room and the surgeon came to see us. After his operation: Surgeons didn't manage to remove all of the AVM, but the rest disappeared by itself . 'We had to sign a consent form for emergency surgery. It said the main risk was death but without surgery, he would die. 'My heart was breaking as the word death was mentioned a lot. 'Lee likes to keep his emotions to himself but he was the most upset. He kept saying: ‘he can’t leave us yet.’ He was really panicking. But it was out of our hands so we just had to trust the surgeon.' Doctors explained to the couple they still didn’t know what had caused the bleed but that they needed to remove it and reduce the pressure in his brain immediately to stop any further damage. Amazingly, Jacob survived the six-hour operation but he remained in a critical condition in intensive care. Jacob's brain before the operation: The malformed area can be seen bottom right . Hayley said: 'A nurse brought us to see him. It was horrible. It didn’t look like him. His head was really swollen and so were his eyes. 'He had a tube coming out of his head to drain all the fluid from his brain. He had so many wires coming out of him I was scared to touch him.' A scan showed the operation had been a success but surgeons were unable to remove all of the AVM. Three days later, Jacob was taken off his life support machine to see if he could breathe on his own.To everyone’s amazement, he took his first breaths unaided and was later moved to the high dependency unit, where he continued to make progress. Due to the stroke, Jacob suffered weakness on his left side so severe he couldn’t even hold his head up and he needed intensive physiotherapy. After two weeks in hospital, doctors were so pleased with Jacob’s progress, he was discharged. Hayley said: 'I was so scared to bring him home as at this time he still had the AVM inside his brain and there was a very high chance of it bleeding again. I didn’t sleep and didn’t leave the house for weeks. 'We had to go back and forth to hospital for scans, which was awful as he had to be put to sleep. They had to check his brain for any damage.' In February this year, Jacob had an angiogram, where a special dye is used to take pictures of blood flow to the brain. Hayley said: 'The doctor came to see us and said it had gone. He told us Jacob had a healthy brain. He was gob-smacked and so were we. 'But he was still having difficulty lifting his head and he couldn’t crawl. 'At his development check, we were told he probably had cerebral palsy and he may not walk. We didn’t know what the future held for our brave boy.' Hayley and Lee (left) could only watch and wait while their son underwent emergency surgery that could have killed him . But three days after his first birthday, Jacob took his first steps. Now there is no stopping him and he continues to amaze his parents and doctors. Hayley said: 'He’s going from strength to strength and is reaching all his milestones. He’s so determined. 'I can’t thank the staff at both hospitals enough for saving my baby’s life. They are my heroes.' Neurosurgeon Mr Desiderio Rodrigues, from Birmimgham Childrens Hospital, who performed life-saving surgery on Jacob . Jacob’s neurosurgeon, Mr Desiderio Rodrigues, from Birmimgham Children’s Hospital said: 'Jacob was in a very poor state in coma when he was presented to the hospital and had to be intubated and ventilated prior to transfer. 'The scan showed a large blood clot in the back of his brain. It was obstructing the flow of the cerebro spinal fluid, which travels from the brain to the spine. 'I performed an operation to relieve the pressure and then remove the clot from the back of the brain. 'I spoke to the parents prior to the operation and told them it was a high risk operation. The child could even bleed profusely and die during surgery, as the emergency scan had not identified the cause for the bleed. 'There was no choice but as a life saving measure to take the risk and operate. 'During surgery I found a leash of abnormal blood vessels which were the cause of the clot. 'I only removed part of it and follow up MRI scans have showed whatever was left has now gone. The angiogram has confirmed that Jacob has no residual AVM.

A man wielding a machete who cut off his victim’s earlobe with scissors in a brutal robbery has been jailed for life. Richard Wiggins, 38, burst into Christopher Holloway’s home armed with a machete in search of drugs and money on March 21 last year. He handcuffed a terrified Holloway and threatened him with the blade before cutting off his earlobe with a pair of scissors in his house in Folkestone, Kent. Judge Adele Williams described Wiggins as ‘devoid of conscience’ as the court heard how he and another man broke into Mr Holloway’s home hoping to find a ‘substantial amount of drugs and money’, the prosecutor said. Wiggins, whose girlfriend is pregnant, carried a machete while his accomplice, who is still at large, carried an axe in the robbery. Unable to find what they were looking for, the pair stole a wallet and a watch. Wiggins, who has no fixed address, was found guilty and will serve at least six years in prison in what Judge Williams called a ‘cold, calculated and cruel crime’ that would generate ‘great revulsion by the public’.

Benjamin Allerton, 25, has pleaded guilty to one count of GBH and one count of attempted GBH . A drunk driver is facing a lengthy jail sentence after he deliberately drove over a group of youngsters in a tent, after giving them a five-second countdown to escape. A judge was told how Benjamin Allerton, 25, targeted the group with his Peugeot van following an argument with them in Selby, North Yorks, in March this year. The youngsters miraculously survived, but one boy who couldn't escape in time was hit by the van and later needed surgery for a broken arm and broken collarbone . York Crown Court heard today how Allerton approached the youngsters, who had been camping in a field next to the River Ouse in Selby and asked them if he could have a cigarette on the evening of March 10. Allerton began chatting with the group and stayed for a while before attempting  to put his arm around one of the girls while in her tent. An 18-year-old member of the group took offence at his actions and a fight ensued resulting in Allerton being knocked to the floor twice before getting into his van and fleeing. The court was told that, a short while later, the group heard an engine’s roar  - which was Allerton’s van careering towards the two tents. The van smashed into a river bank where Allerton then got out and issued his harrowing  countdown before ploughing into a tent and injuring the youngster. Prosecuting, Andrew Dallas said the group had initially welcomed Allerton, who  had been ‘showing off’ and chopping wood for their fire.Mr Dallas said: 'The evening started off amiably but as the witnesses recall, Allerton began to get nasty as he became drunker. 'He went into one of the tents and was seemingly asleep before he put his arm around the waist of a young girl. 'An older member of the group went to remonstrate with Allerton. It’s not known  who threw the first punch but it is clear that Allerton was knocked to the  ground on two occasions before being put into his van.' Allerton is due to be sentenced at York Crown Court tomorrow and has been told to expect a lengthy jail sentence . Mr Dallas said Allerton returned a short time later. 'He drove straight at the tents but missed them and hit a bank at the side of the river,' said Mr Dallas. 'One of the witnesses recalls Allerton yelling ""You’ve got five seconds to get  off my field"" before beginning the countdown, missing out four and ploughing into one of the tents. 'One witness said the group assembled as quickly as they could but a member of the party could not be roused as he was severely intoxicated. 'The van then smashed into the tent and the young boy who was in it was found by his friends a short while later, some distance from his former position.' The teenager sustained a fractured collar bone and fractured arm and had to  endure surgery on two occasions. He had to have pins and plates inserted. Allerton pleaded guilty to one charge of GBH with intent in relation to the 16-year-old boy and one charge of attempted GBH with intent in relation to a 13-year-old girl. The court heard Allerton had stumbled across the group while he was walking  home after having an argument with his sister. He was found on her sofa at around 8am the following day. He was breathalysed and was found to be two times the legal drink-drive limit.

Potts left the house without taking anything but was arrested by police a short time later, walking and drinking a can of beer. Pc Fahd Nassar said on Monday that burglary was an ‘incredibly intrusive and disturbing crime’. He added that it often left the victims feeling ‘violated and no longer safe in their own home, whether anything was stolen of not’. Potts pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison for the attempted burglary in the early hours of July 10.

Butt-sted: A DNA sample from a discarded cigarette led the police to solve the 14-year-old crime . A man has been convicted of a violent rape committed 14 years ago after police found his DNA on a cigarette. Lerio Guerrero, 34, pleaded guilty to the rape and robbery of a 28-year-old college professor in the Lower East Village, Manhattan in 1998 after police linked him to the crime over a decade later. The cigarette was found whilst police investigated the scene of another sexual assault in 2011 where they encountered Mr Guerrero. After arresting him for trespassing and possession of a knife, they took DNA from the cigarette – and discovered a match with the 1998 case. According to reports, Mr Guerrero had nothing to do with the 2011 case and was merely trying to get a closer look at the crime scene. In November 1998, Leiro Guerrero, of Staten Island, attacked the college professor as she entered her New York apartment building. After pushing in through the door, he raped her before robbing her. When he found the contents of her wallet unsatisfying, Mr Guerrero held a piece of broken glass against her neck and forced her to take him to an ATM, where she emptied her account. She managed to retrieve $800 but, still unhappy, Mr Guerrero dragged her to a second cash machine. She was able to break free and seek help. Police say DNA was recovered from blood found on the victim's jacket, left there when her assailant cut himself on the shard of glass he was using as a weapon. At the time, no-one was convicted of the attack and the case went cold. Caught: The NYPD were able to match the DNA found on the scene of a 2011 sexual assault to Mr Guerrero after which he admitted to the 1998 crime . Mr Guerrero was arrested several . times over the following years, including a drink-driving conviction and . possession of marijuana. Each time, however, he was not linked to the 1998 case. It was not until he trespassed at the 2011 rape scene and left behind the remains of his cigarette that New York . Police could link him to the crime 13 years earlier. Mr Guerrero was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty which reduced the sentence from 25 years. The case echoes a similar situation in Montgomery County, Maryland, where a DNA sample from a convicted serial rapist helped solve a 25-year-old case. DNA obtained from a scene where a 20-year-old woman had been brutally raped in 1988 was matched to a sample in the national DNA database CODIS from William Joseph Trice. In turn, this sample could be linked to two more cold case rapes of which Mr Trice had been convicted in 2008.","Lerio Guerrero raped and robbed a 28-year-old college professor in Manhattan in 1998 .

The flag at Cheltenham College flew at half-mast yesterday after the discovery of Jack Bowlby's body on Friday morning. Ms Pitman, 66, was last night believed to be at the side of Jack's mother and her youngest sister Mandy, 54, at her home near Lambourn, Berkshire. Support: Jenny Pitman was believed to be at the side of Jack's mother Mandy . Jack was described as a 'star pupil' by staff at the £30,000-a-year school where a spokesman said it appeared he had died in the night. Headmaster . Dr Alex Peterken said: 'This has been a terrible shock for the whole college. We are a close-knit boarding community and it has hit us all very hard indeed. 'A chapel service has already been held for him and our prayers and thoughts go out to his family, friends and peers.' Jack's housemaster Simon Conner said of him: 'This was a top boy – a star pupil of whom we were all very proud.' The Bowlbys, like Jenny Pitman, are steeped in racing and Jack had competed at the Royal International Horse Show at Hickstead. His mother is a former trainer and his father Mike, 48, an ex-jockey.

Barratts Priceless, one of Britain's best-known shoe chains, will axe 1,600 jobs after attempts to find a buyer for the concessions business failed, administrators said today. It was announced last week that nearly 200 jobs were being lost with the closure of 18 stores in the UK and Ireland. Administrator Deloitte said today it had been unsuccessful in finding a buyer for the concession business, meaning eight times as many jobs will be lost. Going under: Around 1,600 jobs will go at shoe retailer Barratts Priceless, but mostly affect concessions . The firm will continue to trade the . remaining 173 stores as it sought a buyer for all or parts of the . Bradford-based business as a going concern. The concessions are mainly in Dorothy Perkins and Outfit stores. The administrators said failure to find a buyer for the concessions 'will unfortunately result in redundancies of Barratts Priceless staff across units in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'. Daniel Butters, joint administrator and partner in Deloitte's restructuring services practice, said: 'Following a marketing of the Barratts Priceless businesses it is clear that a satisfactory sale of the concession to a new party will not be achieved. Jobs under threat are mostly working on concessions at stores like Dorothy Perkins and Outfit . Under owner Stylo, Barratts and Priceless survived being put into administration in 2009 when 220 of its 380 stores closed . 'Accordingly, the joint administrators have regretfully had to make approximately 1,610 Barratts Priceless Group full and part- time employees working in the various concessions redundant.' The joint administrators are in conversation with the various concessionaires to see how many of the affected people they could either employ or absorb into their existing businesses. They are also in active discussions to rescue a significant part of the remaining business, they added. It was announced last Wednesday that 18 stores would shut two days later. High Street staple: Barratts shoe shops have been a feature of British High Streets and shopping centres for decades. Here is one in 2000, at Bluewater Shopping Arcade in Kent . Online retailer Hawkin's Bazaar said it had collapsed into administration, putting nearly 400 jobs at risk . Five Barratts and 13 Priceless stores were closing last Friday, with the loss of 127 jobs, and a further 60 staff members at the head office in Bradford, West Yorkshire, were also being made redundant. The shoe chain collapsed into administration earlier this month, after unseasonably mild weather further exacerbated already difficult trading conditions. Amid the many shoe factories of  Northampton, William Barratt started his mail order company. W Barratt & Co invited customers to 'Walk the Barratt Way' in advertisements that first appeared in 1903 in the Carpenter and Builder journal. The company's Boots-by-Post service boasted that it sold 'the World’s Best Brogues at Barratt's Factory Price'. In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works, designed to look more like a big country house than a factory. The company flourished to the extent that in 1964 it was bought by rival shoe company Stylo and made the firm’s principle brand. In 2008, Stylo – which had been founded in 1917 by Fanny Ziff, a 27-year-old Russian immigrant – purchased 24 stores from collapsed retailer Dolcis and rebranded them as Barratts. But in 2009, Stylo put Barratts and its other brand Priceless shoes into administration, with 220 of its 380 stores closed down. The remaining 160 stores were bought by current Barratts owner Michael Ziff, former chairman of Stylo and a descendant of its founder. Also today, the owner of Hawkin's Bazaar said it had collapsed into administration, putting nearly 400 jobs at risk. Zolfo Cooper was appointed as . administrator of Tobar, which owns Hawkin's, as well as toys and . children’s accessories retailer Letterbox, and its wholesale, mail . order, and online businesses. The group employs 380 full-time staff . at its 65 permanent stores and at its head office in Beccles, Suffolk, . which are now in jeopardy as the retailer seeks to sell all or part of . the business. The business will continue to be traded . as a going concern by the administrator but a further 55 'pop-up' Hawkin's stores, which opened over Christmas and employ some 400 . temporary staff, will be closed in coming days in line with its previous . plans. Hawkin's was set up in 1973 and sells unusual toys, gifts, games, gadgets and curiosities. It describes its offer as 'things you thought had gone forever, things you never even knew existed'. A spokesman for Zolfo said: 'The directors have worked very hard to turn the business around but have concluded that administration is the best route forward.' Hawkin’s collapse, following the crucial Christmas trading period, comes after D2 Jeans appointed administrators earlier this week. There are fears that many more chains could fold in coming weeks as businesses are sunk by their quarterly rent demands from landlords amid tough trading conditions. Lingerie chain La Senza, originally set up by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, is also expected to appoint administrators in coming days, and there is speculation Blacks Leisure will meet a similar end after it put itself up for sale.","Job loses will mostly be at concessions in Dorothy Perkins and Outfit stores .

Mangled: The £150,000 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder ended up in a garden after hurtling off a runway at 100mph . Mr Padmore was flung from the car and suffered serious head and chest injuries. In a statement, the Padmore family said the drive was intended as a once-in-a-lifetime treat for Mark, who has cerebral palsy. 'It was the first run at the aerodrome . and Graham was driving in a straight line, not round and round when he . crashed,' they said. 'We have not had any details back yet . about the car. Graham is a sensible family man who is very safety . conscious and would never do anything to put himself or Mark in danger. 'Sadly, this was a birthday treat . which has gone tragically wrong. We would like to thank the staff at the . aerodrome who risked their lives to drag Mark from the car, all the . emergency services and the staff at Wythenshawe Hospital. 'Our main priority now is to concentrate on hoping for our dad’s recovery.' Mr Padmore, who was also celebrating his birthday, had hired the car, which has a top speed of 200mph, as a treat. The pair had been given special permission to use the runway by the owners of the site, Avro Heritage. A Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, like the one Mr Padmore crashed . The . crash happened on Monday at the western end of the airfield, with the . Lamborghini smashing through two fences and a ditch before ending up on . its roof in the garden of a large farmhouse. Graham's wife Georgina and daughters Helen, 28, and Claire, 30, were watching, it is believed. Adam . Jones, 37, a birdwatcher from Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, who . witnessed the aftermath, said: 'There were a dozen police cars on the . airfield which, considering it has been closed for a year, I thought was . a bit strange. 'I got out of my car and in the garden was an up-turned Lamborghini with about half-a-dozen police officers standing near it. 'I’m surprised anyone got out of that car because it was so badly mangled and upside down. 'It seemed to have jumped over a ditch and into the back garden. 'To be honest, I assumed it had been a high-speed chase. Now it turns out it wasn’t like that. It was a tragic accident.' Graham is being treated for severe chest and head injuries at Wythenshawe hospital. The Lamborghini left the road towards the western end of the runway, flipping over a ditch and two fences to land in a garden . A . neighbour told the Sun: 'Graham is a sensible driver and didn't want to . break the speed limit on public roads so he tried to organise doing it . as safely as possible. 'He wanted to treat his son. They were driving it all weekend and were having a fantastic time.' Avro Heritage spokesman James Fletcher said their thoughts were with the family of the two men. He said: 'I can confirm that there were no other vehicles involved.' It is understood the pair were allowed to use the runway for free at their own risk. Sergeant . Danny Byrne from Greater Manchester Police's Serious Collision .

Jail time: Ronnie Barker's son Adam Barker has been sentenced to 12 months behind bars after he admitted making indecent images of children . Ronnie Barker’s son caused his father ‘unquantifiable distress’ after going on the run for eight years to avoid being prosecuted  for child porn offences, a judge  said yesterday. Adam Barker missed both his parents’ funerals and was not even aware of their deaths until ‘relatively recently’ as he hid in Hungary, a court heard. The 44-year-old’s whereabouts  remained a mystery until he finally returned home to face justice earlier this year after running out of cash. Yesterday he was jailed for a year after  admitting having 1,675 indecent images of children at his home, including child rape. Sentencing, Judge Rosa Dean told him: ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.’ Referring to a letter written by Barker’s sister to the court, she said it was clear his decision to flee ‘caused an unquantifiable distress to your family, and that must of course remain on your conscience. 'But for the court’s processes it means you prevented justice taking its course’. Barker, a bit-part actor, was arrested in 2003 as part of Operation Ore after police traced credit card payments he made for some of the images. During a dawn raid  on his home in Ealing, West London, he told a detective examining his computer:  ‘You’d better take it otherwise it would a dereliction of your duty.’ Barker, who appeared in the ITV detective series Wycliffe and had small parts in Monarch of the Glen, Casualty and the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, was released on bail while officers liaised with prosecutors about what charges to bring. Family ties: Adam Barker (left) with his famous father (right) and mother in 1997. Both of his parents have since died . Actor: Adam Barker has appeared in TV programmes including Wycliffe, pictured as DS Ian Potter, far right, Monarch Of The Glen and the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies . But he vanished leaving a note for . his parents, which read: ‘Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police . came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my . computer. I was arrested. ‘I . must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents. Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away. You . must understand that I won’t be able to contact you for quite some . time.’ Ravinder Johal, . prosecuting, told Isleworth Crown Court: ‘What we know now is that Mr . Barker fled to Hungary where he stayed for eight years, returning in . July when it appears that he ran out of funds.’ An artist impression of a much thinner Adam Barker in July, during his first appearance in court . Barker’s father, star of Porridge, The Two Ronnies and Open All Hours, died in 2005, the year after his son jumped bail. He never spoke publicly about his son’s disappearance and friends said that he ‘died of a broken  heart’. Detectives were waiting to question his son at the memorial service held at Westminster Abbey, but he did not turn up. He also missed the funeral of his mother Joy, who died aged 78 after a short illness last January, leaving him an inheritance of £2million. It remains unclear whether he will collect it. Simon Ray, defending, said Barker had not been aware of their deaths until recently. ‘This is a source of sorrow and grief for him. He is profoundly sorry for the fact that is caused distress for his family. He accepts that what he did was wholly wrong.’ Barker claims that he did not  own a computer and never viewed child pornography during his time in Budapest. However, the judge said: ‘Nobody is in a position to know what he was up to in Hungary.’ Barker pleaded guilty to 20 counts of child porn between January 1999 and June 2003.Of the 1,675 images and videos in his possession, 92 were graded level four – the second highest category. Barker showed no emotion as he was jailed yesterday. None of his family attended the hearing.

A woman cleaning out a home for a future episode of reality show ""Hoarding: Buried Alive"" has developed a respiratory illness caused by deadly hantavirus. Officials have placed the home in Houston under quarantine. As many as 30 people, including the film crew and neighbours who volunteered to clean up the home, have been in the house and could have been exposed to the virus. Contamination: A worker helping to clean out a Texas house for an episode of TCL's Hoarding: Buried Alive is suffering from hantavirus, a rodent-related respiratory disease . Infection with the hantavirus comes from inhaling or ingesting particles of mice droppings, or urine, and has a 40per cent mortality rate. Three visitors to Yosemite National Park died from the same virus after staying in infested cabins. Danger: Neighbours have been warned to stay away while the victim, who has not been named, undergoes further tests . Symptoms: National Park pamphlets on the virus describe its flu-like symptoms including headache, fever, muscle ache, shortness of breath and cough . More than 10,000 tourists were warned to watch for symptoms. Hantaviruses are spread through rodent bites, urine or saliva. Humans infected can develop potentially fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever  and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Early symptoms are similar to the flu and include chills, fever and muscle aches. Sufferers . may may begin to feel better for a short  time, but within 1-2 days, . experience breathing difficulties, a dry cough vomiting and headaches. Of . the 587 documented U.S. cases since the virus was identified in 1993, . about one-third proved fatal. There is no specific treatment for the . virus. Almost . all cases involving humans have been linked to contact with rodent . excrement. However human-to-human transmission has been reported with the . Andes mountains in South America. The . name hantavirus comes from the Hantan River area in South Korea, from . where the first cases were identified in the late 1970s. The disease was formerly known as Korean hemorrhagic fever. The home in the Houston suburb of Woodlands has a sheriff's deputy stationed outside. Neighbours have been warned to stay away while the victim, who has not been named, undergoes further tests. A woman who had been in the home to . help in the cleanup effort tested positive for the disease and is now . recovering and being placed on a course of antibiotics. A second test on the woman by the state health department will determine whether she does in fact have hantavirus. 'This particular area, it's an . extreme case of rodent infestation. There's evidence of rodents, mice, . snakes, possums in and around the home, which is not unusual in a . hoarding situation because there's so much material. 'It's impossible to keep it clean and . track the rodent population,' said Dr. Mark Escott with the Montgomery . County Health Department. Hantavirus is a disease that's . carried by rodents, and when you go through processes like cleaning the . home, sweeping, vacuuming, that sort of thing, it goes into the air. The hantavirus takes one to six weeks to incubate. Flu-like symptoms initially appear, and the disease progresses rapidly.

Thousands of young jobless Europeans are being offered £1,000 in taxpayers’ cash to come and work in Britain. The European Commission will pay £250 towards the cost of crossing the continent for an interview and £830 in moving expenses if they get a job. Critics will ask why Brussels is offering to subsidise unemployed Europeans to travel to the UK when nearly a million young Britons are without work here. Controversial: Thousands of young jobless Europeans are being offered £1,000 in taxpayers' cash to come and work in Britain . The scheme, which aims to match jobseekers with suitable jobs, is being piloted in Spain, where youth unemployment exceeds 50 per cent. The young jobless from Germany, Denmark . and Italy are also set to benefit – with the plan likely to be rolled . out across the entire EU. In this financial year alone, some 5,000 people are expected to profit from the ‘Your First EURES Job’ scheme, run by EURES – the European Employment Services. Its website says the scheme could soon be open to ‘all young people aged 18 to 30, nationals of any of the EU 27 member states and legally resident in any of the EU 27 member states who wish to find a job in a member state other than their country of residence’. Participation is open to the under-30s ‘irrespective of their level of qualification, work experience or social and economic background’. ‘The purpose of Your First EURES Job is to make it easier for young people to access actual jobs and for employers to find the workforce they are unable to find at local, regional or national level,’ said the website. It adds that jobseekers can claim 1,000 euros from the European Commission – £830 – if they get a job in Britain. Worries: Critics will ask why Brussels is offering to subsidise unemployed Europeans to travel to the UK when nearly a million young Britons are without work here . Critics fear it will see an influx of youngsters from countries with high unemployment, such as  Spain and Greece, flocking to the UK. Earlier this month David Cameron said he wanted a crackdown on the free movement of workers across the EU. He said: ‘I believe in the single market, I believe in free movement.But you know, two weeks ago, I visited two factories in a week, and I asked the question, “How many people do you employ from other EU countries, what’s the balance?”. ‘In one, it was 60 per cent; in the other it was 50 per cent. Now, heaven’s above, we have got so many unemployed people in our country that we want to train and educate and give apprentices to and get back into work.’ Official figures show there are 2.53million unemployed in the UK, including almost one million jobless young adults. Long-term youth unemployment has been steadily rising for the last 18 months. Tim Aker, from the Get Britain Out campaign, said the fact that the scheme was taxpayer-funded was ‘astonishing’. ‘No wonder we’re all fed up with the EU,’ he said. ‘Mass unemployment caused by the eurozone is the eurozone’s problem. The EU shouldn’t undercut British workers by offering British jobs to unemployed Europeans.’ The Department for Work and Pensions said the scheme, also open to young Britons who want to move to other EU countries, tried to avoid sectors with ‘high unemployment’.","The European Commission will pay £250 .

A baby boy is one of just 63 people in the world with a rare condition causing his heart to squirt  blood around his body instead of pumping it. Six-month-old Jack Renton's heart  could stop at any moment as blood is only squirted around his body intermittently and not constantly pumped around it. He was diagnosed with extremely rare condition '8p23 deletion', which causes heart conditions, learning difficulties and behavioural  issues such as hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Little fighter: Six month old baby Jack Renton, from Elsdon, Northumberland, is one of just 63 people in the world with a heart that squirts blood instead of pumping it after being born with the extremely rare condition '8p23 deletion' Brave: Jack Renton, pictured with his mother Joanne Wright and father Davey Renton, is now due to have an operation to secure an elastic band around a heart valve to stop it squirting blood rather than pumping it . The condition is caused by cells in the body having a small but variable  amount of genetic material missing from one of their 46 chromosomes -  chromosome eight. The toddler will soon undergo surgery to tie an  elastic band around the valve in his heart to stop it squirting and force it to  pump instead. His parents, farmers Joanne Wright and Davey Renton, from Elsdon, near Hexham,  Northumberland, found out they were  expecting last September but quickly realised something wasn't right at a 20-week scan when the baby was tested for Down's Syndrome. Risk: Jack Renton's heart could stop at any moment because of his condition . Ms Wright, 30, said: 'The blood test for Down's syndrome came back as very high so  I had an amniocentesis. 'It was then that they found the 8p23 deletion. The doctors and nurses were fantastic, talking it all through, helping us to  understand. 'Basically it meant Jack's heart wasn't right. There was no way I was going to have a termination. We were already in love  with our baby, and I felt, in my heart of hearts, that he or she was a survivor. 'We knew that the right chamber of his heart is very small and that blood is  squirted around his body rather than pumped. 'He also has a hole in the middle of both chambers in his heart. It all sounds  very scary.' Jack was born prematurely in May at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary Hospital weighing just 4lb 14ozs. Ms Wright said: 'Davey kept telling me it would all be OK. He told me it would be just like  lambing a ewe, which made me laugh. 'Jack came out with a loud cry and promptly weed all over the midwife. I was expecting him to be so vulnerable, so quiet and weak, but he's a  fighter. He has defied all the odds and we are all just amazed by him.' Following his birth, Jack was taken from the couple and immediately transferred to  the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for specialist treatment, where he stayed for  21 days. Mrs Wright said: 'I knew that he was getting the help he needed, but I missed him  desperately. 'I remember sobbing through the night - I just wanted to be with him.' Now that Jack is six months old, doctors have scheduled surgery in the next few  months on his heart. Early diagnosis: Jack's parents found out that he had the rare condition when his mother Joanne Wright, pictured, went for her 20 week scan . Mr Renton, 34, said: 'Jack is putting on weight - he's getting stronger and stronger  every day. He's our little fighter and we're so proud of him.' The couple hope to get married next autumn and christen baby Jack on the same day. Ms Wright said: 'We want to celebrate Jack and our life together in one big day,  with all the people we love around us. 'We're hoping Jack's surgery will all be over with by the time of the wedding  and christening next autumn. 'I'm only just allowing myself to get excited about it.'","Six-month-old Jack Renton suffers from '8p23 deletion' causing blood to be squirted around his body intermittently .

The camera used to capture the most iconic image of the Second World War has turned up at a car boot sale in Wales, experts believe. The emotive picture taken on June 6, 1944, has come to symbolise the D-Day landings, regularly appearing in newspapers and magazines even to this day. A 1940s museum in West Wales thinks it may have stumbled across the very camera used by war journalist Jim Mapham to take the photo from Sword Beach in Normandy. The image of battle-weary troops, described by the U.S. press as 'the greatest picture of the war', is now kept at the Imperial War Museum in London. Piece of history: The Super Ikonta B Camera that is thought to have once belonged to Jim Mapham, and a print of the famous Sword beach photograph . Famous image: A print of the famous photograph, which was described by the U.S. press as 'the greatest picture of World War II' Investigations are underway to establish whether the standard-issue military camera, spotted on a table at the car boot sale in Carmarthenshire, was indeed the one that captured the image. Efforts are being made to match up serial numbers held by the Imperial war Museum. Officials at the museum say that, if authentic, the camera would be an 'important discovery'. Documents sold with the camera confirm that it was sold in Leicester, where Mapham had lived and worked as a news reporter after the war. Since then it has only had two other owners. 'It was buried with a load of junk at a car boot sale,' said cameraman and photographer Seimon Pugh Jones, director of Tin Shed Experience, a 1940s museum in Laugharne. Mr Jones’s background in vintage and war photography sparked his interest in the item. Window into history: The standard-issue camera was found on sale in Carmarthenshire along with documents that confirm it was sold in Leicester, where Mapham lived and worked as a news reporter after the war .

'I was at a stall at the United . Counties Showground in Carmarthen chatting to a guy with some . interesting bits and pieces,' he said. Sergeant James Mapham, of the Army Film and Photographic Unit, took a series of pictures of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944. The most famous was 'Operation Overlord', which Mapham captured at 8.30am under intermittent enemy gunfire and shelling on on Queen Red Beach, Sword Area. In the foreground of the picture taken near la Breche, Hermanville-sur-Mer, are sappers of 84 Field Company Royal Engineers, part of No.5 Beach Group. Behind them, heavily laden medical orderlies of 8 Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps (some assisting wounded men) prepare to move off the beach. In the background, weary men of the 1st Battalion, the Suffolk Regiment and the Lord Lovat's No. 4 Army Commando are landing on the beach. The image is now filed away in the Photographic Archive of the Imperial War Museum in south London. Source: The Imperial War Museum . 'He . happened to mention that he had a camera with some documentation and . that it looked like the camera of a war photographer. We have a couple . of models here in the museum so I bought it.' Having . studied the papers, Mr Jones said: 'They show it is a standard issue . camera for the British Army photographers and correspondents. With it is . a receipt which shows the camera was sold in photographic shop in . Leicester in 1965. 'It looks like there have only ever been three owners before us, the second being a W Atkinson in Leicester. 'When we looked at it, we think it could very well have belonged to Mapham because the location and timing of sale fits.' Mr . Jones and the team at the Tin Shed have bee in contact with the . Leicester Mercury, the newspaper where Mapham later worked as a . photographer, to find out more.The memorable photo was just one of numerous images from many rolls of film shot on June 6. Mapham's lens captured the invasion from start to finish, from a panoramic shot . of a moored fleet to his sunset shots of troops moving inland. Mapham had been made Field Marshal Montgomery's official photographer and had also taken pictures of Winston Churchill. After the invasion, he stuck to the front lines, breaking off to spend time documenting the French Resistance, where he was made an honorary member of the Maquis. Having returned to his home in Leicester and work at the local daily paper, he died aged 59 at his cottage in Oadby in September 1968. A spokeswoman from the Imperial War Museum said the find, if confirmed, could be a coup for the West Wales museum. 'In the context of Second World War photography, Jim Mapham is best remembered for his coverage of the British landings on Sword Beach during June 6, 1944,' she said. Puzzle: Experts are trying to verify whether this is the same camera and efforts are being made to match up serial numbers held by the Imperial war Museum . 'Arriving with Sherman tanks of the 13/18th Hussars as part of the initial assault wave, Mapham was in an ideal position to capture the start of the D-Day landings. 'His photographs take one through the dramatic events of June 6-7 from approaching Sword Beach under fire, through the drama of the landings to the initial push inland. 'Amongst the images captured by Mapham is one of the iconic photographs taken on D-Day showing British troops coming ashore whilst under German mortar and artillery fire. That medics are seen assisting men wounded whilst landing gives the photograph a real immediacy. 'From his original notes we can tell that Mapham used a camera with the serial number WD 51 in Normandy. If the camera discovered by the Tin Shed Museum turned out to be one and the same, it would be an important discovery.' The Tin Shed Museum is now appealing for more information about Jim Mapham, and looking for any photos that may exist of Jim Mapham during the war holding the Super Ikonta B camera.","The photo has come to represent the D-Day landings .

One of Britain’s oldest shops is closing after the recession left owners unable to renew the 126-year-old lease. The Famous, a menswear shop in Cheltenham, opened in 1886 selling trousers for 13 shillings (65p), a suit for 30 shillings (£1.50) and overcoats at 4/11 (24p). It is one of the last shops in the country to operate the once popular Lamson vacuum system, which sends money to a cashier’s office. Much loved: The menswear shop called The Famous, in Cheltenham, opened in 1886 but will shut at the end of the year . But owners of the family-run business selling men’s clothing now say it must close - because they cannot afford to renew the lease. The Cole family have been renting the property from a private landlord since it opened but now cannot afford to keep it going. It will close at the end of the year after 126 years of trading in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Chairman Ross Cole, the great grandson of AN Cole, who bought the business in 1896, has worked at the shop for more than 50 years. Are you being served? The Famous has become an iconic shop in the spa town . Closing down: The current chairman Ross Cole has said the lease has become unaffordable for the much loved business . He said: 'The building is very expensive to maintain and stay in and obviously we have felt the pinch quite a bit. 'This has been offering for the last two years and we knew we had reached the point where we had to make a decision either way. 'The business is still going well but we decided, after discussing among ourselves, that we simply couldn’t replicate what we have here in a modern shop premises. 'It’s a very sad day and I have already umpteen letters and phone calls from customers which brings tears to my eyes. Colourful character: Richard Cole, 36, one of the owners of The Famous, stands before shelves filled with bright jumpers . Part pf history: Wendy Gray has been an employee at The Famous for 24 years . Suits you, sir: Mr Cole checks over some of the many jackets and blazers on sale . 'We are very grateful for the tremendous support and loyalty we have received from our customers over so many years.' The Famous opened its doors at the present site in the same year as Coca Cola was launched and both Cheltenham Town and Arsenal football clubs were founded. Menswear director, Richard Cole, 36, said: 'It is a shame and it will be missed by our customers, we have had some very long standing ones. 'We have had the lease since the opening of the shop, but the price of the lease has gone up in the recession.' Down the tube: Cashier Dawn Hodges picks up a money capsule sent from the shop floor via a suction tube system, which can be seen on the wall behind her. Cash flow: The tube system was installed in 1930 and is thought to be one of the oldest of its type in the country, moving capsules filled with cash using vacuum technology . Landmark: The Famous store is to close its doors for the last time after 126 years . The shop will be holding a closing down sale from November 1. It will still operate a children’s clothing store in new premises in the spa town. Martin Quantock, Cheltenham’s town centre manager, said: 'The Famous menswear store is something of a landmark. 'There are not many people who went to school in Cheltenham who have not worn school uniform from there.' The Famous opened its doors in 1886, when Queen Victoria (pictured right) was on the throne. It was also the year of the first ever Crufts dog show in London and the year that Arsenal Football Club was established. Despite proudly being a north London team nowadays, it was set up by workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London, under the name Dial Square. Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novel Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde was also first published in 1886. There were some similarities to modern Britain though. In February there were two days of rioting in London, which led later that year to the introduction of the Riot (Damages) Act that enabled property owners to claim compensation from police in the event of damage due to a riot.

While America's Curiosity rover has excelled at sending back pictures of rocks on the Martian surface, Europe has not been left behind - as these stunning images of the Martian landscape show. On 8 June, the high-resolution stereo camera on Mars Express captured a region within the 1800 km-wide and 5 km-deep Argyre basin, which was created by a gigantic impact in the planet’s early history. It reveals the astonishing beauty of the red planet, with mountains frosted in carbon dioxide, and vast craters in an area researchers have dubbed the 'island of silver' due to the frost topped peaks. The Argyre and Hooke Craters on mars, with a frosting of carbon dioxide clearly visible in the top right of the image, taken from the Mars Express spacecraft. The area covered by the new images . After Hellas, the Argyre impact basin is the second largest on the Red Planet. The name stems from the Greek word ‘argyros’ (silver) and Argyre was . an ‘island of silver’ in Greek and Roman mythology. Giovanni . Schiaparelli, the famed Italian astronomer, gave the name to this bright . region on Mars in his detailed 1877 map. At the centre of the larger impact basin is a flat region known as Argyre Planitia. The . Mars Express images in this release all show a portion of the northern . part of this area, with a large portion of each image dominated by the . western half of the 138 km-wide Hooke Crater, named after the British . physicist and astronomer Robert Hooke. Most . of Argyre Planitia has been shaped by wind, glacial and lacustrine . (lake-based) processes, creating the smoother appearance of the . landscape surrounding Hooke Crater.

The most striking feature of this image release, shown clearly in . the first image at the top of the page, is the icing sugar-like covering . of the surface to the south (left) of the image. This is frost, but . made of carbon dioxide, not water.

Jay Whiston, 17, whose funeral was today after he was stabbed while attending a house party that spiralled out of control . A teenager stabbed to death after a party advertised on Facebook spiralled out of control has been buried in a Cookie Monster coffin. Jay Whiston, 17, died from a single stab wound to his heart after he attended a party being held by a 15-year-old schoolgirl in an upmarket neighbourhood in Colchester, Essex. Despite efforts from the girl’s family to keep the revellers closely monitored, the event became overrun with up to 100 gatecrashers after it was leaked onto Facebook. Jay, a student who lived in nearby Clacton, was stabbed to death in the road just yards away from the house. Police, who are still hunting for the teenager’s killer, have released five teenagers on bail on suspicion of murder. More than 300 of Jay’s friends and his heartbroken family attended his funeral today held at Weeley Crematorium. There were so many mourners at the funeral that they spilled out of the chapel and onto the surrounding grounds where they listened to the emotional service from a loud speaker. A hush descended over the mourners as a horse-drawn hearse arrived with Jay’s electric blue coloured coffin. The coffin was adorned with images of the Sesame Street character, the Cookie Monster, who was a favourite of Jay’s when he was growing up. The teenager even had a tattoo of the character and since his tragic death, many of his friends and family have had the same image inked on their bodies in tribute. Reverend Alan Wright described how Jay’s family had been living 'hell on earth' in the weeks since the killing of their 'hero'. He said: 'Jay could not tolerate violence, least of all could be stand and remain aloof when his friends were being bullied.' Jay's body was carried in a Cookie Monster coffin as he was a massive fan of the character and had a tattoo of it on his arm . R.I.P: A Cookie Monster floral tribute outside the crematorium . Speaking on behalf of Jay’s father, . Stafford Whiston, he said: 'Jay, you were my inspiration - you would . have been one of this country’s great entrepreneurs who would have . helped get the country back on its feet.' Reverend . Wright said Jay believed those who carried knives were 'cowards' and . called on society to turn their back on those who carry them. Jay’s . sister Holly broke down in tears as she read a tribute to her brother . who had hoped to go on to university to do business studies and dreamed . one day of having two little girls. Since . the tragedy Jay’s mum Caroline Shearer, 47, has hit out at Britain’s . soft justice for allowing knives to become rife on the streets. She . said: 'I have no forgiveness for those that are allowed to roam and . terrorise our streets. This sort of thing is what you see on the news . but parents have got to realise that it can happen to you. Tragic: Jay's mother Caroline Shearer being comforted by her brother .

'It . isn’t right that parents cannot send their children to a party without . fearing for their safety due to these knife-wielding thugs. Judges need to be given the powers to give punishment that is equal to the crime.' It is still not clear what triggered the killing which happened earlier this month on September 9. Alhough police have looked into the possibility that Jay stepped in to help a friend who was being picked on. Heartbroken: Jay's dad Stafford Whiston at the service today . Hundreds of mourners gather to pay their respect to the teenager . Jay was going into his second year studying A-levels at Frinton Technical College having achieved nine grade As from his 11 GCSEs. He lived with his mum and step dad Michael Shearer, 57, and family, including foster children at their home in Clacton and was described as 'a loving boy dedicated to his family'. He was already making plans for university next year and had worked at his dad’s pawn broker business since the age of 13 instead of claiming weekly pocket money. Five teenage boys from Colchester are currently on bail, on suspicion of Jay’s murder. Two of the suspects are 18 whilst the remaining three are all 17. They are all due to answer bail next month.

Scientists say they are now '99% certain' the Sun is surrounded by dark matter, a phenomenon first proposed in the 1930s by a Swiss astronomer. Fritz Zwicky, who came up with the theory decades ago, believes that clusters of galaxies were filled with a mysterious dark matter that kept them from flying apart. At nearly the same time, Jan Oort in the Netherlands discovered that the density of matter near the Sun was nearly twice what could be explained by the presence of stars and gas alone. Yet even today, mystery surrounds whether dark matter actually exists at all, let alone where it is. The team in Zurich created a high resolution simulation of the milky way to test their theory, and found that large quantities of dark matter existed around the sun. However, an international team led by researchers of the University of Zürich have developed a new theory - and built a state-of-the-art simulation of the Milky Way to test their mass-measuring method before applying it to real data. They found that techniques used over the past twenty years were biased, always tending to underestimate the amount of dark matter in the universe. The researchers then developed a new unbiased technique that recovered the correct answer from the simulated data. Applying their technique to the positions and velocities of thousands of orange K dwarf stars near the Sun, they obtained a new measure of the local dark matter density. The high resolution simulation measured the amount of mass in the galaxy to predict where dark matter was . 'We are 99% confident that there is dark matter near the Sun,"" says the lead author Silvia Garbari. In fact, if anything, the authors' favoured dark matter density is a little high: they find more dark matter than expected at 90% confidence. There is a 10% chance that this is merely a statistical fluke, but if future data confirms this high value the implications are exciting as Silvia explains: . 'This could be the first evidence for a ""disc"" of dark matter in our Galaxy, as recently predicted by theory and numerical simulations of galaxy formation, or it could mean that the dark matter halo of our galaxy is squashed, boosting the local dark matter density.' Co-author Prof. George Lake said: 'If dark matter is a fundamental particle, billions of these particles will have passed through your body by the time your finish reading this article . 'Experimental physicists hope to capture just a few of these particles each year in experiments like XENON and CDMS currently in operation. 'Knowing the local properties of dark matter is the key to revealing just what kind of particle it consists of.'","Researchers recreated the Milky Way inside a computer to try and find signs of dark matter .

French oyster buyers have turned to the British market because their own supplies have been obliterated by herpes, it emerged yesterday. British oyster sellers claim they are experiencing a huge increase in sales after French suppliers started buying up their stock. They are purchasing as many oysters as they can to replace their own dwindling numbers, caused by a new micro-variant of the infection - oyster herpesvirus.

The disease has always been present, but the new strain has become lethal and is now widespread in France - killing off the popular aphrodisiac. Britain annually produces 1,100 tonnes of oysters and now around 15 per cent are immediately going abroad - with France the biggest market. With Oyster sellers claiming the British market is finally picking up after being 'stagnant' for 30 years. However, some are warning of a price hike in British stocks with Kent supplying the most and best quality shellfish in Britain.

He said: 'Yes, the French are coming over and buying in large numbers. 'Prices have been stagnant for 30 years, but over the past year, they have risen to a half decent level. 'It’s not as good as it used to be, but it’s getting better and we are just about matching inflation rises now. 'I have worked hard setting up links with French companies and that is going well. 'We are also setting up a new building to sell market oysters, which is an exciting project.'

Butterflies in Japan are suffering from 'serious abnormality' following the radioactive fallout after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Scientists found unusually small wings and mutations in the legs and antennae of insects collected in May last year, two months after the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck. The radiation exposure harmed their genes and the damage could be passed on to future generations, according the journal Scientific Reports. Contrast: A healthy adult pale grass blue butterfly (top) and a mutated variety (bottom) with shriveled wings. It said that 'artificial radionuclides . from the Fukushima (No 1) nuclear power plant caused physiological and . genetic damage' to pale grass blue butterflies, a common species in . Japan. 'Sensitivity (to . irradiation) varies between species, so research should be conducted on . other animals,' said Joji Otaki, a team member and associate professor . at the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa. 'Humans . are totally different from butterflies and they should be far more . resistant' to the health effects of radiation, Otaki noted. Genetically altered: One of the mutated adult pale grass blue butterflies found in Fukushima, Japan . The researchers collected 121 adult pale grass blue butterflies in and outside Fukushima Prefecture in May 2011, two months after the nuclear crisis started. Abnormalities such as unusually small wings were found in 12 per cent of the total. But the rate rose to 18 per cent in a second generation produced through mating among the butterflies collected and some even died before reaching adulthood. When second generation butterflies with abnormal traits mated with healthy ones, the rate of abnormalities rose to 34 percent in the third generation, according to the article. The team collected another 238 butterflies last September and determined that the abnormality rate stood at 28 per cent. 'To blame': The researchers collected 121 butterflies in and outside Fukushima Prefecture two months after the power plant meltdown (above) in March last year . However, it nearly doubled to 52 per cent among a second generation born to the original butterflies caught. It was after breeding them, they  noticed various abnormalities that hadn't been seen in the previous generation, such as malformed antennae. The researchers said the butterflies collected in May were heavily exposed to radiation as larvae. The impact was apparently more severe on the second generation, as well as on the butterflies collected in September, because they suffered heavy exposure at a far earlier stage while they were still fertilized eggs or just reproduction cells, according to the team. The impact of artificial radiation exposure on the species was also investigated using larvae collected in Okinawa, one of the prefectures least affected by fallout from the nuclear disaster. After the larvae were exposed to radiation and fed with leaves contaminated with radioactive materials, similar rates of abnormalities and premature deaths were observed, the article said.","Abnormal wings and antennae found in Japan's insects .

If you use popular file-sharing programs to download films and music from the internet, the chances are that your computer's virtual address has been logged, a study has claimed. Computer scientists at the University of Birmingham monitored what is perhaps the largest file sharing site, The Pirates Bay, over the last three years. The team discovered that the most popular files on the site, often illegal copies of hit TV shows or films, were monitored by, on average, three secretive parties - including copyright enforcement agencies, security companies and even government research labs. The monitors are believed to be logging the IP address of the user - potentially identifying where the file is downloaded to. A user downloads files from The Pirate Bay (posed image): Research at the University of Birmingham suggests there users are being logged on behalf of copyright holders . However, for anyone now worried about a knock at the door, the researchers say it is unlikely the evidence gathered would be sufficient to lead to court proceedings. When a user chooses to download a file, the users join a 'swarm' of other users who are either downloading the file, of have successfully received it. But by downloading a file, the user's IP address is available to other members of the swarm, and the Birmingham University team found monitors actively grabbing this information. The researchers found that: . The research was carried out by developing software that acted like a BitTorrent file sharing client, and logging all the connections made to it. The team say careful analysis of the logs revealed the presence and behaviour of file-sharing monitors. A torrent file by itself is just a small document, smaller than a Word document. But when you download a torrent, you are then connected to a 'swarm' of other users who are either downloading the file, of have successfully received it. As the users downloads, he or she in turn uploads the file back to other users, a clever innovation which, when used for legal purposes, ensures files stay available and that people can get the best download speed possible. But by downloading a file, the user's IP address is available to other members of the swarm, and the Birmingham University team found monitors actively grabbing this information. Proponents of the technology praises its speed, and there are plenty of legitimate uses, from downloading large software updates to non-copyrighted materials. But, with media companies being slow on the digital uptake, many users turned to the technology for both the ease-of-use and the lack of a price-tag. The report said: 'Most large-scale monitors hide their identity by using third party hosting companies to run the searches for them, but other monitors are identifiable as copyright enforcement organisations, security companies and even government research labs. 'The researchers also found that the use of third party hosting companies allowed the monitors to avoid ""block lists"",that attempted to stop known monitors from connecting to file sharers.' Dr Tom Chothia, researcher at the School of Computer Science, said: 'This work reveals the full scale of the monitoring of illegal file sharers. 'Almost everyone that shares popular films and music illegally will be connected to by a monitor and will have their IP address logged. What is done with this information in the long term only time will tell'. With the number of prosecutions of file sharers increasing there is a legitimate concern of the standard of evidence used in these cases. Dr Chothia added: 'All the monitors observed during the study would connect to file sharers believed to be sharing illegal content and verify that they were running the BitTorrent software, however they would not actually collect any of the files being shared. 'Therefore, it is questionable whether the monitors observed would actually have evidence of file sharing that would stand up in court.'","University's three-year study shows an average of 'three secretive monitors' watching you download .

A former detective who helped catch the Yorkshire Ripper has tonight made the shocking claim that Jimmy Savile was quizzed over the serial murderer's crimes. Former West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible killer. Mr Stainthorpe, who worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who spent years trying to catch Peter Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put forward by members of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may seem. Scroll down for video . Savile, seen at Broadmoor in 1991, as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe meets boxer Frank Bruno, who was on a visit to open a new gym . John Stainthorpe said a member of the public named Savile as a suspect . 'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.' Today, however, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman . said: 'Hundreds of people were identified in the operation, we cannot be . more specific than that at this time. 'Details of all who were questioned . in connection with the crimes are in storage, so we cannot confirm that . Jimmy Savile was spoken to.' Mr Stainthorpe said the person who gave police the anonymous tip-off was 'aiming in the right direction'. 'Child perverts soon become child killers,' he added. The detective's shocking revelation comes as the killer claimed today that Savile regularly visited him in custody and the pair became friends. Rubbishing claims the late DJ abused . around 300 victims over six decades, Sutcliffe said those making allegations . were 'jumping on the bandwagon'. The Yorkshire Ripper's horrific crimes shocked the nation as he embarked on a  murderous rampage across the country, slashing his victims, mutilating them and killing them. Between 1975 and 1980, the vicious murderer attacked women, stabbed his victims with screwdrivers, stamped on them, left notes with their bodies taunting police for not catching him and killed in total 13 women. Officers desperate to catch him cast their net far and wide as they hunted for the man who signed his notes as 'Jack The Ripper' and launched a huge campaign, publishing his notes and voice recordings in a bid to have someone identify the murderer by his writing or voice. In 1981 he was convicted of  murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. Sutcliffe, 66, who will never be released from Broadmoor mental hospital, told the Sun that the claims made against his 'friend' Savile were just exaggerations. Jimmy Savile, shown relaxing at his penthouse flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in 2006, lived just yards from where Sutcliffe killed his third victim . A victim of Savile has demanded police instigate any links between him and the Yorkshire Ripper . Peter Sutcliffe has defended Savile . He said: 'It's a load of rubbish. People are just getting carried away. 'He visited a lot. He'd always come and chat with me on visits and I would introduce him to my visitors. Several times he left £500 for charities I was supporting.' One of Savile’s abuse victims urged police to investigate any links between the pair, The Sun reported. The victim told the newspaper: 'Sutcliffe and Savile are two peas in a pod. 'It's quite fitting the only person to stick up for Savile is Sutcliffe.' Sutcliffe's 'friend' Savile was said to have been given his own set of gold-plated keys to high-security Broadmoor mental hospital, where Sutcliffe is a patient. He was allegedly given bedrooms or an office at . three hospitals, and yesterday more former patients came forward to say . he abused them on children’s wards. The details come after it was reported that Sutcliffe killed his third victim, . Irene Richardson, mere yards from Savile’s flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in . 1977. Miss Richardson was killed near the disgraced paedophile's three-bedroom penthouse, which overlooks Roundhay Park. It is three miles outside Leeds city . centre, with floor to ceiling windows, and has been put on the market . for £325,000, with the proceeds intended for the Jimmy Savile Charitable . Trust. Savile's relatives said they do not . want a penny of his £4.3million estate and called for the cash to be . donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes. Mental hospital: A gold-plated set of keys to Broadmoor was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed . At . Broadmoor, Savile boasted that he was actually responsible for getting . some mentally ill patients - among them murderers - freed from their . sentences. He called himself the ‘Governor’ of the . hospital and was made chairman of a hospital taskforce by the Department . of Health in the 1980s. Savile, who died a year ago aged 84 in his Leeds flat, is now believed by police to be one of the UK's most prolific child abusers. Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into the television and radio star's activities. Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse. Savile was allegedly questioned by police about the crimes of Peter Sutcliffe. Seen here are twelve of his 13 victims . Police are pictured searching the grounds of a property where the body of Marguerite Walls, the 12th victim of Peter Sutcliffe, was discovered. A detective claims the disgraced DJ was quizzed by police in connection with the terrible deaths . Police and forensic experts, seen examining the place where another victim was killed by the Yorkshire Ripper, spoke to hundreds in their hunt for the killer . The police launched a huge campaign to track down the killer who hurt so many women, and were given Savile's name by a member of the public during the inquiry . Last month health chiefs announced an inquiry into Jimmy Savile’s reign of abuse at three NHS hospitals. It will be run by the Department of Health itself, raising fears it cannot be truly independent. Former barrister Kate Lampard will oversee the investigation to provide ‘independent oversight’, Downing Street pledged. It will examine why the paedophile presenter was allegedly given the keys to Broadmoor mental hospital, a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville and free rein at Leeds General Infirmary. He allegedly raped and molested young victims for decades without anyone stopping him. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘[Kate Lampard] will provide oversight of the Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor inquiries as well as the Department of Health’s inquiries into the appointment and role Savile held at Broadmoor Hospital. ‘All relevant information from these inquiries will be passed to the police.’ Unlike the BBC, which has issued several grovelling apologies, none of the hospitals has yet said sorry for the alleged abuse. Savile, who raised £40million for the hospital in his lifetime, boasted that he ‘lived’ in a bedroom managers had given him at Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, and said he could do as he pleased.","Member of the public named Savile as a 'potential Ripper suspect'

This picture shows a nine-year-old boy happily posing for a holiday snap next to Jimmy Savile’s Rolls-Royce - just hours before the child alleges the disgraced TV star abused him. Members of the boy’s family took the photograph of him by the iconic luxury motor while on holiday in Southsea, Hampshire, unaware that the occasion would go on to haunt the youngster for years. It’s believed Savile was in the area for a charity event in aid of disabled sports people when he allegedly preyed on the child in 1972. Family holiday: The young boy pictured posing next to Jimmy Savile's Rolls-Royce, left, claims he was later abused by the TV star, right . Lawyers representing the alleged . victim, who is now middle-aged, have released the picture in a bid to . jog people’s memories as they seek more information. The . alleged victim has reported the incident to a police force in the north . east and is putting together a statement for the Metropolitan Police. He was aged about nine at the time and his face has been blurred as he cannot be identified for legal reasons. Solicitor Alan Collins specialises in child abuse cases for Pannone Solicitors, the legal firm representing the man. Mr Collins said: 'We want to know more about what this event in Southsea was. The victim remembers it being a charity event for disabled sports people. Mystery event: The alleged victim believed Jimmy Savile, pictured on Top Of The Pops in 1976, was in Southsea, Hants, in 1972 for a charity event in aid of disabled sports stars . Scene of the alleged crime: The alleged victim claims Savile abused him on Southsea common, in Hampshire, pictured above . The estate of Jimmy Savile has been frozen in response to the mounting sexual abuse claims against the late television and radio star. NatWest Bank, which is acting as the Jim'll Fix It presenter's will executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold because of the allegations. Savile's estate is reportedly worth £4.3 million. NatWest said in a statement: 'Given the claims raised, distribution of the estate has been put on hold.' Savile's will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to 26 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times. The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the document which instructs that £20,000 in cash was to be shared between 20 of the celebrity's friends, family and neighbours. It says a further £600,000 was to be put into a trust fund, with the interest shared between eight people. The remainder - just under £3.7 million before expenses - was to be held by NatWest on behalf of The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust. 'We want to know specifically if Savile was the guest of honour and who was involved in arranging his visit. 'An organiser wouldn’t get into trouble because they may not be the person or organisation who employed Mr Savile.' He is being assessed by a psychiatrist before Pannone decides how much compensation to seek from Savile’s estate. Mr Collins said: 'It appears Mr Savile was able to have direct access with young people and do terrible things to them. 'This is a typical child abuse case and the victim has for many years been able to suppress what happened to him. 'Now with all the attention surrounding Mr Savile the memories have come back.' Pannone is following up other lines . of inquiry from victims across the country, after reports that more than . 200 people say Savile abused them. It comes as Savile's niece today told how she 'cried for a week' after hearing accusations that her uncle had abused hundreds of girls. Pam .

Huge investigation: Police are now investigating hundreds of reports of abuse by Jimmy Savile, pictured in the Yorkshire town of Ilkley in September 2010 . Mrs Ward, 66, said she was in a state . of 'disbelief' when she first heard what the 'kind and charismatic' uncle she knew was accused of doing. The married mum of four said she is . ashamed of her uncle's alleged actions, and she has no idea what she . would say to the victims. 'Shocked': Pam Ward, from Edinburgh, said she had been left in turmoil over the recent revelations about her shamed uncle Jimmy Savile . Speaking to an Edinburgh evening paper she said: 'It was disbelief at first. It’s like I’ve lived a sheltered life and never known any of these things were going on. 'The first week, well I practically spent the first week crying. I’ve been sent lots of flowers, had phone calls and cards, with people offering support. 'It’s nothing to do with me, but in a sense I feel ashamed. I’m sure it’s the same with the rest of the family, although I wouldn’t like to speak for them. 'Everyone has been talking about all the awful stuff. The good work he committed himself to all his life has been quickly forgotten. 'What can I say, what would you say to the victims if it was your relative?' Mrs Ward was 43 when she discovered that Savile was her long-lost uncle. Adopted at 18 months, she waited until her adoptive parents had died before starting to search for her birth parents. It was then she discovered her father was Jimmy’s older brother, John Henry Savile. Mrs Ward had cut ties with her father in the years before his death in 1998, but said she was completely unaware of the allegations until they were reported in a Sunday newspaper on October 14. The walls of her home remain decorated with several of her uncle Jimmy’s pictures, which Mrs Ward has felt unable to take down. She added: 'Hopefully in years to come they will look back at some of the good work he did, but I understand it’s pretty unlikely.'","Boy's parents took this photo of him next to Savile's Rolls-Royce while on a family holiday Southsea, Hants, in 1972 .

A major earthquake in Spain that killed nine people and injured more than a hundred was man-made following the extraction of groundwater, say scientists. The magnitude 5.1 tremor struck the historic town of Lorca in south-east Spain last May. Despite being 1,000 times smaller than the devastating 9.0 earthquake that struck Japan and triggered a tsunami a few months earlier in March 2011, the Lorca earthquake caused lives to be lost, reduced buildings to large piles of rubble and left cars flattened. Devastated: A policewoman consoled the daughter of a victim (pictured middle) following the Lorca earthquake in May 2011, which claimed nine lives. Now scientists say they have found evidence the disaster was man-made and believe it was the result of water being sucked out of the ground to feed domestic supplies. The loss of the water caused stress changes in the earth's crust along a major faultline, triggering a rupture in the rock and leading to the earthquake, according to the research. The findings, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, highlight the extent to which human activity can influence seismic shocks. Scientists led by Dr Pablo Gonzalez, from the University of Western Ontario in Canada, used satellite data to map the ground deformation caused by the Lorca earthquake. They then carried out computer simulations of the fault slip. The results showed a pattern that correlated with stress changes due to loss of groundwater. Since the 1960s, natural groundwater levels in the region have reduced by 250 metres. Cause of the quake: Scientists believe water extraction may have resulted in the earthquake that devastated Lorca last May. The researchers wrote: 'We conclude the presented data and modelling results are consistent with a groundwater crustal unloading process, providing a reasonable explanation for the observed fault slip pattern.' The findings implied that 'anthropogenic activities could influence how and when earthquakes occur'. In an accompanying commentary article, Professor Jean-Philippe Avouac, from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, US, wrote: 'We should remain cautious of human-induced stress perturbations. We know how to start earthquakes, but we are still far from being able to keep them under control.' Crushed: A car stands destroyed by debris following the 5.1 tremor. Collapse: Historic buildings were reduced to rubble, destroyed cars in Lorca in May 2011. Professor Peter Styles, from Keele University, said the findings could have wider implications for extracting shale gas, which uses hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking' as it is commonly known. He said: 'This is a very exciting and stimulating paper. The authors comment on the role which anthropogenic activity can play in stimulating the response of the crust and there will no doubt be speculation as to the implications of this for hydraulic fracturing in the context of shale gas exploration.' Evacuation: Residents fled for their lives following the disaster, which may have been man-made, according to new research. Damaged: Birds fly over the cracked bell tower of the church in Lorca, following the tremor which claimed the largest number of earthquake-related deaths in Spain for more than 50 years. Reduced to rubble: Hundreds of residents were forced to leave their homes, which crumbled during the quake.","The magnitude 5.1 tremor struck historic town of Lorca in May 2011 .

Talk about late post, this card took 49 years to arrive from Germany, but its rightful recipient Derek Lewis is grateful he finally got it . Now, after putting out an appeal, the couple have tracked down the rightful recipient, Derek Lewis, 71, a retired grandfather who used to live in their house. Mr Crabtree, 37, said: 'We were surprised that the original stamp was intact and it was in such good condition. 'We thought it was pretty funny that the Royal Mail decided to deliver it and that there wasn’t even a note on it. 'We are also wondering where it could have been all these years. It would be quite interesting if we could track its very long journey.' Despite its long and delayed journey, the card is in good condition, with the stamp still intact. Intended recipient Derek Lewis points out that postcodes weren't in general use at the time . A delighted Mr Lewis said the card had come from an old pen pal, Gudrun Rentrope, who he’d been writing to since he was 17. Gudrun had sent the postcard as a thank you after Mr Lewis had looked after her father during a visit to England. Dear Derek, . First thank you very much for the presents, which you have given to my father and thank you that you met my father. Today I am with my class in Bad Godesberg and Rhondorf. There lives our chancellor.

Mr Lewis, who also lives in Maidenhead, said he was ‘totally surprised’ when it finally reached him 49 years after it was posted. 'The postcard thanked me for looking after her dad and passing on gifts. She was a very dear friend. It was quite a pleasant time in my life. 'In those days people didn’t have postcodes and I think this could have been one of the reasons it went missing. I can’t imagine how it got back into the system again.'

Amateur astronomers across the U.S. who keept their eyes peeled this weekend to saw a dazzling light show as the second grand meteor shower of the year peaked early Saturday. Amateur photographers captured gorgeous images of the meteors as dozens per hour fell across the night skies. As amateur Scott Tully in rural Conecticut told MSNBC after capturing a shot of a blazing Leonid meteor streaking overhead: 'Amazing!' Shooting: In Freeland, Maryland, amateur observers snapped beautiful pics of the Leonids before dawn . The best nights to view the Leonid meteor shower, pictured, will be 17 and 20 November . Budding astronomers could see between 10 and 15 bright meteors an hour as the shower reaches its peak . Star gazers should not concentrate on the area around constellation Leo but keep their eyes moving across the sky. The best time to look for the Leonid meteors will be after midnight. It is thought to be the best time to watch out for shooting stars too.The Leonids move around the sun in the direction opposite to that of Earth so they slam into our atmosphere almost head-on. It causes the fastest meteor velocities possible: 45 miles per second. The Leonid meteors are cosmic dust and debris, shed into space by comet Tempel-Tuttle,  which was . discovered by German astronomer Ernst Tempel in 1865. Experts predicted sky watchers could be treated to between 10 and 15 bright meteors an hour. The comet orbits the sun once every 33 years. Every time it completes an orbit, it leaves behind a trail of dust in its wake. These orbit around the sun and the earth usually hits a different trail every year. Experts predicted this year would be a . particularly good year to look for the Leonids because the . moon will be only crescent and will have set in the west long before the . constellation Leo begins to rise. With the moon out of the sky completely, viewing conditions could be ideal for sky watchers with clear weather and dark skies. It was a rare opportunity to see meteors up to 600 years old. The Leonids have a reputation for their . brightness. The show follows hot on the heels of the Perseid meteor shower back in August.

As the American Red Cross continues to draw heat for not adequately meeting the needs brought on by Hurricane Sandy, the organization is responding that its relief efforts have been ‘near flawless.’ The organization, which calls itself ‘the world's largest humanitarian network,’ took that stance in an interview with an NBC reporter on Sunday. ‘Given the magnitude of this storm, the American Red Cross is very proud of its response - our largest U.S. relief effort in more than five years,’ Laura Howe, a Red Cross spokeswoman told the Daily Mail in an email exchange. On the job: (A handout image from the American Red Cross) A volunteer walks from a Red Cross emergency response vehicle after accepting a 'no-heat' hot meal in Staten Island, New York, on November 7 . Double checking: Volunteers with the American Red Cross review their notes as they distribute relief supplies to Hurricane Sandy victims in Ocean County, New Jersey on November 5 . The Red Cross recently got caught up in a media storm that has shaken its public image over the past two weeks. The New York Times on November 2 ran a story under the headline: ‘Anger Grows at Response by Red Cross’ The Associated Press on November 4 ran a story under the headline: ‘Red Cross Carries on After Drawing Criticism — Again — for Its Response to a Major Disaster’ Thirteen days have passed since Hurricane Sandy ravaged the East Coast, killing at least 120 people and causing an estimated $50 billion in damage from South Carolina to Maine. Helping out: Staten Island resident, Robert Munoz, collects supplies from a mobile Red Cross unit on November 7 . The storm destroyed homes around New York City and along the New Jersey Shore, cut off power for more than 8 million people and delivered a major blow to public transportation systems. Several hundred thousand people in New York and New Jersey are still without electricity, including an estimated 170,000 on Long Island. Volunteers, public officials and those who have been impacted by the storm are directing some of their anger at the Red Cross. 'I saw them up at FEMA (a claim center . outside Breezy Point),’ a 79-year-old storm victim in Queens told an NBC . reporter. ‘What would they do? Were they offering anything? No. I need . services, I don’t need them to give me coffee.’ Devastation: A volunteer passes a damaged home emblazoned with U.S. flags in the Rockaways . James Molinaro, Staten Island’s borough president, took a recent opportunity to chastise the organization, calling its ‘absence from the relief effort’ an ‘absolute disgrace.’ Molinaro told a New York Times reporter that he had visited a shelter after the storm and witnessed people arriving barefoot. ‘They were in desperate need,’ he said. ‘Their housing was destroyed. They were crying. Where was the Red Cross? Isn’t that their function?’ The Red Cross and its president, Gail McGovern, are now juggling relief efforts with efforts to keep criticism at bay. The organization publicly apologized last Sunday for not responding sooner to get food, water . and other supplies to storm victims in New York and New Jersey. ‘No disaster response is perfect, and we understand the frustration people feel,’ Howe told the Daily Mail. ‘But with nearly 6,000 volunteers delivering millions of meals and hundreds of thousands of supplies, we are serving more neighborhoods and more people every day.’ On site: (A handout image from the American Red Cross) Residents in Long Beach, New York, lining up in a grocery store parking lot to receive meals from the organization on November 3 .","The Red Cross responds to growing criticism calling its hurricane relief efforts ‘near flawless’

Unrepentant: Elliot Jackson went on Facebook to say he 'wished' Cregan would come to Wales and 'take out our pigs' A man has been arrested for allegedly setting up a Facebook site praising murder suspect Dale Cregan. Detectives took jobless Neil Swinburne, 22, away for questioning after they traced the website ‘Dale Cregan is a Hero’ to his home in Liverpool. The page contained posts which mocked the deaths of WPCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes. One read: ‘So a pair of coppers got killed who gives a s***?’ Another, making reference to the Hillsborough report which criticised the police for the disaster in which 96 fans died, added: ‘Justice for the 96 not the two.’ Swinburne was arrested under the Communications Act 2003. If found guilty, he faces a six month jail sentence. He was bailed last night. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘I think [the public] would have wanted us to take positive action and that’s exactly what ourselves and Merseyside Police have done.’ Elsewhere, an internet troll who described Cregan as a ‘legend’ stood by his comments, comparing the murder suspect to crazed killer Raoul Moat. Jobless Elliot Jackson of Newtown, Powys, went on Facebook to say he ‘wished’ Cregan would come to Wales and ‘take out our pigs’. When confronted by the Mail, the 20-year-old said he had no sympathy for the two WPCs because police officers are ‘all dirty scumbags’. Speaking about Cregan, he added: ‘He is a legend. He shot down two police. Move over Raoul Moat, there’s a new guy on the block.’ Jackson, who admits he has been to jail for violent crimes, initially demanded money for an interview, but spoke even though he was assured he would not receive a penny. Later his mother, Alison, said: ‘They are disgusting things to say. Two families are suffering because two policewomen have died. They have all my sympathy.’ The Facebook arrest comes after .

NBA rock star Jeremy Lin hit the court for his first game with Houston on Wednesday night, helping the Rockets score a 105-96 victory over the Detroit Pistons. The Harvard alum and former New York Knicks sensation had 12 points and eight assists during the game. Lin, 24, had a meteoric rise from bench warmer to starting point guard for the Knicks. Rock star: Houston Rockets guard Jeremy Lin is forced to pass the ball against the defensive play of Detroit Pistons forward Kyle Singler, left, and forward Andre Drummond (left) The Taiwanese-American, who never received an athletic scholarship and was repeatedly overlooked by college basketball recruiters, started his NBA career in 2010 with the Golden State Warriors and received little playtime in his first season. Last season, he saw the fame and sponsorships pour in while playing for the Knicks. The Rockets acquired Lin in July on a four-year, $28.8million contract. Houston’s other big acquisition, James Harden, took center stage on Wednesday night with 37 points and 12 assists, and Carlos Delfino made four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to lead the Rockets to victory. Detroit led 83-72 early in the fourth, but Harden and Delfino brought the Rockets back. Houston acquired Harden on Saturday night in a trade with Oklahoma City and yesterday agreed on a five-year, $80million contract extension with him. The reigning Sixth Man Of The Year certainly looked worth it in the season opener. Harden fell just short of his career high of 40 points, and his 12 assists were a career best. Brandon Knight led Detroit with 15 points. The Rockets won without Patrick Patterson, who was out with a left quad strain. With Houston down 11 points, Harden started the comeback with a 3-pointer, and Greg Smith followed with a dunk. Detroit led only 85-83 after consecutive 3-pointers by Delfino, then a layup by Chandler Parsons tied it. Direction: Houston Rockets head coach Kevin McHale gives Lin some pointers in a game last week . Smith dunked to put the Rockets ahead 89-87, and he dunked again to make it a four-point game before hobbling off with an apparent injury. A dunk by Detroit's Jonas Jerebko cut the lead to two, but Delfino made two more 3-pointers to make it 97-89. Harden pretty much put the game away with a three-point play with 1:27 remaining that put Houston ahead 104-94. Attendance was announced at 16,646, and there were plenty of empty seats on Halloween. The fans who did turn out saw an entertaining performance by the Pistons that ultimately fell short. Harden scored 19 points in the first half, but Detroit led 58-55 after a 36-point second quarter. The Rockets led 65-58 after Harden's two-handed dunk off a nice one-handed bounce pass from Lin. The Pistons looked terrific for the rest of the quarter. They scored 13 straight points - including consecutive dunks by Greg Monroe and Jason Maxiell - to take a 71-65 lead. A 3-pointer by Harden cut the deficit to two, but Detroit ran off another eight straight points and led 79-69 following a basket by Kyle Singler. It was 81-72 after three quarters.","Lin scores 12 points with eight assists in first Houston Rockets game .

"Julia Edgecox had A-cup breasts enlarged to C-cup after breastfeeding made chest sag . Five years later PIP implants burst, poisoning body with liquid silicone . Replacement implants also ruptured - now silicon lumps invading tissue . Describes operation as 'biggest regret' By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 09:28 EST, 8 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:18 EST, 8 October 2012 . A mother of two has spoken out to tell how her burst breast implants ruined her life - after undergoing ten operations in 16 years to correct them. Julia Edgecox, 55, went under the knife in 1991 to boost her breast size from an A to a C-cup after breastfeeding left her with a saggy chest. But five years later they burst and poisoned her body with liquid silicone - and the replacement implants also ruptured. Julia Edgecox went under the knife in 1991 to boost her cust from an A cup to C cup after breastfeeding left her with a saggy chest . Since then Julia has undergone eight operations to drain silicone from her lymph nodes and is now dependent on antihistamines to control her body's reaction to the poison. She said: 'They are my greatest regret - they have ruined my life. 'When my first implants burst it was awful, they were liquid silicone so it went everywhere. 'Doctors tried to mop up what they could but they couldn't get out what they couldn't see. It's like an oil spillage in sea. 'The rest of the silicone migrated around my system and from then onwards, there was no going back.' Julia's second silicone breast implants were taken out following a rupture in 2003 . Julia Edgecox in 1996, following her first breast enlargement surgery, on holiday in Cornwall. A few months after this picture was taken the implants ruptured . Housekeeper Julia, from Stratford-upon-Avon, had her first implants fitted at Warwick Hospital in 1991 after she was left unhappy with the shape of her breasts after breastfeeding her children. The hospital felt her case was strong enough for her to be put forward for the operation on the NHS. But five years after undergoing her breast augmentation surgery Julia experienced a searing pain through her left breast. Worried, she returned to Warwick Hospital, where she was told her implant had burst. Julia underwent another operation to replace the burst implants, but after having having the new implants put in, says she was left with what she describes as a crisp packet-shaped crease visible through the skin. Unhappy with how it looked, she begged her doctor to replace them. The doctors at Warwick hospital didn't feel Julia's case warranted further surgery and refused to treat her further. Instead, Julia transferred to the George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton where a surgeon was prepared to replace the implants eight weeks later. Julia believes that her breast implants ruined her life - saying they have been her greatest regret . It was then discovered that the left implant had burst again - and doctors were forced to give Julia a full breast reconstruction when she said she no longer wanted to have implants. But the saga was not yet over. Following the reconstruction surgery, Julia noticed mysterious lumps appearing under her arms and went under the knife in Warwick Hospital to have them removed. Doctors discovered the lumps contained silicone and drained them - but informed Julia that she may face the problem for the rest of her life. The lumps have returned every two or three years ever since - her body's attempt to rid itself of the silicone - and has Julia has to undergo repeated operations to drain the fluid. Julia claims she has spent the last 16 years being poisoned by her implants after two sets burst and flooded her system with silicone . In 2009 she had the lymph nodes under her arms removed completely but the lumps still appeared. Doctors have recently diagnosed Julia with silicone granuloma, a skin condition that occurs as a reaction to liquid silicone. Medics are baffled as to how they can rectify the problem. Julia underwent two MRI scans at Warwick Hospital to enable doctors to work out why the silicone is migrating to her arms. She is now due to undergo another operation at Coventry Hospital to remove yet more silicone, and doctors hope to use the MRI results to stop the problem. She said: 'I feel a little bit like an alien now. I just feel like my body is not mine any more. 'It's hard to explain to people because nobody knows. Some days I feel OK and some days I feel like I have run a marathon. 'My body doesn't like itself any more it is so confused. 'I have to take antihistamines to stop it attacking itself. 'I get lumps every two to three years now. My body is desperate for these to be removed - they are a foreign object that my body doesn't like at all. 'Doctors have removed most of my lymph nodes now but now the silicone has n where to go any longer so it is depositing itself into tissue. 'I have two MRI scans scheduled to plan what they need to do to stop this, I don't quite know what they are going to do though, it is a bit scary. 'I am just sick and tired with the pain under my arm, it is just constant.' Julia also believes that the stress of what she has been through has not only ruined her health but has also cost her her marriage of 25 years to husband Peter. Julia recovered in 1999 after her first silicone implants were removed following a rupture but says she now feels alien . She added: 'My husband decided to walk out on me after 25 years of marriage with not even an acknowledgement that I was sick. 'I don't know if he was fed up with me because I got this problem. I had no support from him or his family. 'It was absolutely awful. At the same time I lost my sister and then my mother. I didn't know how I was going to get through it.' Julia hopes her case can act as warning to others in light of the PIP breast implants scandal. 'It is really quite scary,' she said. 'The PIP scandal opened the issue up for a lot of woman, why should I keep silent forever? Why shouldn't people know about this? 'I really feel they should have some sort of warning on this - a post like on a packet of cigarettes so they can tell you.' 'I don't even dream of going swimming, I can't do things like I did before, it has affected my life entirely.'","Julia Edgecox had A-cup breasts enlarged to C-cup after breastfeeding made chest sag .

Holding fort: The Chelsea skipper's home was attacked while he played this away game against Tottenham . Family: John Terry with his wife Toni and children Georgie John Terry and Summer Rose after winning the Premier League in 2010 . Terry had hired the extra security due to the intensity of the media spotlight on him following being charged by the Crown Prosecution Service with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's game against QPR at Loftus Road in October. It is unclear whether the attackers were intent on damaging the property or attempting burglary. A friend of Terry said: 'They were all completely shocked at what happened, especially with young children in the house and two grandmothers. It was a very scary experience for all of them at a hugely difficult time for the family.' In the dock: The Chelsea captain is under scrutiny for alleged comments made towards Anton Ferdinand . It is understood that the attack has not been reported to the police. Terry was playing at White Hart Lane in his first match since the charges were announced.

A detailed picture of how a teacher and schoolgirl lived while on the run in France has today emerged as he appeared at an extradition hearing. Jeremy Forrest, 30, appeared before magistrates in Bordeaux, four days after he was arrested on suspicion of child abduction. He will return to Britain after the French court agreed to his extradition. The married maths teacher from Ringmer, East Sussex, travelled to France with pupil Megan Stammers, 15, on September 20. The pair checked into one Bordeaux hotel for a night and then spent six nights in another, where they subsisted almost entirely on a diet of takeaway kebabs. Scroll down for video . Undercover: British teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, is escorted out of a Bordeaux court today, four days after he was arrested on suspicion of abducting his 15-year-old pupil Megan Stammers . Tight security: Forrest will return to Britain on Thursday after the French court agreed to his extradition . Mario Remi, the owner of a Lebanese . kebab shop near the Britons' hotel, said: 'They came several times. He . always took the food away for both of them.' A European arrest warrant was issued for Forrest after the pair failed to use return ferry tickets on September 23. Forrest, who this morning appeared in court . wearing a T-shirt, checked shirt and trousers, confirmed his name and . nationality before agreeing to return to Britain on Thursday morning. The decision to extradite him to the UK came as it emerged that a British expat had told police where Forrest and Megan were staying days before they were finally located. Builder Ian Loveridge, 48, said he tipped off British police last Tuesday after seeing television news coverage about the missing pair and then spotting Megan in a Bordeaux street. He said: 'I saw a young girl standing at the top of the street and recognised it was Megan straight away mainly because she looked so out of place. ‘Forrest was standing next to the entrance and she gave him a big hug. ‘They then disappeared into the hotel. They both looked very comfortable in each other’s company and clearly wanted to be with each other.' Accommodation: The pair stayed at the Huguerie Hotel (pictured) for six nights.

On their first night in Bordeaux, Forrest and Megan stayed at the two-star Hotel Choiseul (pictured), before moving on to the Huguerie . Fast food: Mario Remi, who runs a Lebanese kebab shop, said the pair dropped by a number of times . But it was two days later before . French police finally stopped by the Huguerie Hotel - and the owner . failed to recognise a photo of Megan and so they left empty-handed. Owner Gerald Agier said Forrest had arrived alone and checked in using the name 'Dean'. The pair stayed at the Huguerie for six nights. On . their first night in the city, Forrest and Megan stayed at the two-star . Hotel Choiseul, before moving on to the Huguerie Hotel. Outside court today, Forrest's British . lawyer, Phil Smith, said: 'Now that he has agreed to be extradited to . the UK, we look forward to the full story emerging. 'He is very appreciative of the support of his family and concerned about the impact of this on all those concerned.' Forrest, Megan's teacher at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, was being kept in detention until his removal.

Bordeaux by a member of the public who recognised the teacher from . television coverage as he touted a bogus CV around bars in Bordeaux . seeking cash-in-hand work. They had spent eight days apparently dodging police and staying in budget hotels as they planned a new life together.

Lord Carey, pictured, is certain any moves to change the law on gay marriage will put society 'on a slippery slope where the unintended consequences could be shocking' David Cameron's plans to allow gay marriage could have ‘drastic’ consequences, even allowing men to marry more than one woman, the former Archbishop of Canterbury will warn Conservatives tomorrow. In a speech at this week’s party conference, Lord Carey will say same-sex marriages ‘strike at the very fabric of society’. He will say it is difficult to know at this stage what the consequences would be if gay marriage were introduced, according to a draft seen by The Mail on Sunday. But he will cite developments in other countries where the law is being liberalised, including France, where the government intends to ban the words ‘mother and father’ from official documents, replacing them with ‘parents’. Lord Carey, who also writes in The Mail on Sunday today that the Government needs to confront the ‘divisive’ issue of immigration, will add: ‘We can be sure any move away from our traditional understanding of marriage is to put our society on a slippery slope where the unintended consequences could be shocking. 'I note, for example, that on August 28 the BBC reported that a public notary in Sao Paulo has accepted a civil union between a man and two women. 'Once we move from the solid ground of marriage earthed in that time-honoured relationship of a man and woman, in a loving relationship open to procreation, we can be sure the result will not strengthen the life of society and will not greatly help the life chances of our children.’ Lord Carey will cite developments in other countries where gay marriage has been legalised as reasons why it should be blocked in the UK .",The former Archbishop of Canterbury will set out his reasons why he believes gay marriage would 'strike at the very fabric of society' at the Tory party conference .

Her eldest son Joseph, 18, testified yesterday as jurors were shown a surveillance video of Coello taking the large bag out of his car, which looked as if it contained a body. As the video played, he told the court: 'Eddy is walking out of my house with my mom. It's my mom,' according to the New York Post. He said that he had heard his mother arguing with Coello over the phone earlier in the day and he later came home to find his mother wasn't there.

It . was another day of damning testimony against Coello, who was fired by . the NYPD in 2000 after a violent confrontation with an ex-girlfriend. Last month, texts sent by the murdered wife to Coello were revealed. Prosecutors say Coello, 41, flew into a violent rage after Ms Adovasio told him in text messages she wanted a divorce because she suspected him of cheating. In one, she told him that if he wanted to 'live his life as a single guy’ he should 'take his s**t' and get out. The texts were read at a pre-trial hearing on a defense motion to keep the jury from seeing the confrontational texts. The . angry missives about Coello’s alleged cheating were retrieved from . Coello’s phone by Detective John Fennelli shortly after the former . policeman was arrested at his home, according to the Post. In one, Coello told his suspicious wife that he was having trouble getting home because of flooded highways.

Free: Janette Mercer, who lied to police to protect her son Sean Mercer, has been released from prison . The mother of the killer of 11-year-old Rhys Jones, who lied to police in an attempt to protect her son, is enjoying her freedom following her release from prison. Jannette Mercer, 54, was sentenced to three years in jail in 2009, for perverting the course of justice in an attempt to protect her son Sean Mercer. But she has now completed her sentence, and was seen shopping in Liverpool, the Sunday Mirror reported. Sean Mercer, now 21, was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years for the killing of Rhys Jones who was shot in the back on his way home from football training in 2007. Tragic Rhys became the innocent victim of a bloody turf war fought between two notorious Liverpool gangs the Croxteth Crew and the Strand Gang from Norris Green. After hearing rival gangsters were near the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park, Mercer, just 16 at the time, armed himself with a gun and rode to the pub before letting off three shots at his intended targets. Rhys was hit by the second shot. Janette Mercer had backed up her son's denial of the shooting telling police he did not own a silver bicycle that he was captured on CCTV using to flee the scene. But investigators were able to prove that the bicycle had been delivered to her home five months earlier. Jeanette Mercer, who reportedly worked as a £50-a-day prostitute, quickly changed her plea from not guilty on the first day of her trail but the Judge told the court she had told 'a pack of lies'. After being evicted from the family home during her time inside she is now living in a terraced house around four miles from the scene of the murder. She is one of seven people linked to the murder to have since been freed from prison. Tragedy: Rhys Jones (left)  was shot and killed in 2007 by Liverpool gang member Sean Mercer (right) Last year Gary Kays and Melvin Coy, both 29, walked free after serving half their seven-year sentences. Kays was said to have made the phone call to killer Mercer telling him rival Norris Green gang members were at the Fir Tree pub, in Croxteth Park. Nathan Quinn, who disposed of the murder weapon and clothes worn by Shaun Mercer, has also been released. And it has also now emerged that the gang member who provided the gun that killed Everton fan Rhys could also be released after serving just four years. Murder weapon: The gun used in the fatal shooting . James Yates was jailed for 12 years for supplying the Smith and Wesson revolver used in the shooting. Yates, 23, who helped Mercer cover his tracks following the shooting, was originally jailed for seven years for assisting an offender and possessing a firearm, but the sentence was increased to 12 years by the High Court as it was 'unduly lenient'. Yates is now set to be put on a day release programme after being moved to Hatfield Open Prison in South Yorkshire this week. Rhys's dad Steve said: 'What you see on the outside is not necessarily what you get on the inside. 'We never really knew how the probation service and the prison service worked. 'If someone gets 12 years you expect them to serve a good wedge of that rather than serving four years and then being given the opportunity to get out. It's not what it says on the tin. 'We know he's eventually going to be . coming out but we don't feel he has served long enough or has been . punished suitably for what he's done. 'Is he going to learn his lesson? Probably not.' James Yates, (left)  who was jailed for 12 years for providing the gun, could be freed after serving just four years. Nathan Quinn (right) who disposed of the murder weapon and clothes worn by Shaun Mercer has also been released . Yates could be reunited with members of notorious gang the Croxteth Crew as he is to be assessed with a view to being granted five days on release each month. Julian Linskill, Yates's solicitor, said: 'Obviously he has conducted himself properly in prison otherwise this opportunity would not have been given to him.' A spokesman from the HM Prison Service said: 'Only prisoners representing minimal risk of escape and harm to the public are eligible for release on temporary licence.'They must pass a rigorous risk assessment.'","Janette Mercer served three years for perverting the course of justice .

Pope Benedict XVI has delivered a prayer in Arabic for the first time during his weekly general audience. More than 20,000 people heard the Pope's prayers in Arabic, part of a new effort by the Vatican to show support for Christians in the Middle East. The Pope today first delivered his own brief greeting in Arabic: 'The pope prays for all the Arabic-speaking people. God bless you all.' Then a priest translated the Pope's prayers into Arabic. Pope Benedict XVI added the Arabic language to his weekly prayers and added that he prayed for all Arabic-speaking people . The Vatican said it was adding Arabic to the six languages, aside from the original Italian, typically spoken during the general audience, to remind Catholics to pray for peace in the Middle East. The prayers are usually delivered in English, French, Spanish. German, Polish and Portuguese. Khalid Hussain, a Pakistani-born Muslim tourist visiting St. Peter's Square, praised the initiative, saying 'I think it will bring a lot of audience into what the pope is saying'. The Pope also praised the Second Vatican Council, which began 50 years ago this week and ran for three years, calling it a 'compass' for the Catholic Church 'in the . middle of the storms'. The Council brought 2,250 bishops together and created 15 'constitutions' which helped reform the Vatican. A mass in St . Peter's Square on Thursday will launch a 'Year of Faith', to celebrate the exact . anniversary of the start of Vatican II. The Vatican is reaching out to Middle Eastern Christians, making Arabic the seventh translated language, alongside the original Italian . Last week, Pope Benedict’s ex-butler Paolo Gabriele was found guilty of stealing confidential papers from the pope and sentenced to 18 months in jail - but he is expected to shortly be granted a pardon. Gabriele, 46, was given the prison term on October 5 for his role in one of the worst scandals to hit the Vatican in recent years, involving allegations of infighting, intrigue and nepotism, and corruption. Prosecutors in the so-called ‘Vatileaks’ case had asked the Vatican court for a three-year sentence for the ex-butler - who had collected a huge number of stolen documents at his apartment within the Vatican. But the presiding judge Giuseppe Dalla Torre reduced the sentence on the grounds of Gabriele’s  service to the Church and his apology to the Pope for betraying him. The Vatican’s spokesman Federico Lombardi said after the verdict that the Pope was ‘very likely’ to pardon Gabriele, who claimed he had been motivated by a desire to root out 'corruption and evil' at the heart of the Church.",Arabic becomes seventh language added to Pope's weekly prayers .

Gypsy Jyll Willis detailed the clandestine relationship as she took the stand in the fifth day of a preliminary hearing of Martin MacNeill, 56, in Provo, Utah on Wednesday. As she left the stand, she locked eyes with MacNeill, staring adoringly at him as she walked past. MacNeill, a former Mormon Sunday school teacher and father of seven is accused of murdering his wife Michele, who was found drowned in the bathtub at their Pleasant Grove, Utah home in 2007. He is accused of forcing her to have a face lift before giving her a cocktail of lethal drugs, which he claimed would help her recovery. She was found dead eight days later. Look of love: Gypsy Willis passes Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of murdering his wife, after testifying against him on Wednesday. They had an affair for more than a year before the death . Willis revealed to the court that she met him online in 2005 and for the first time in person that . November, before beginning a sexual relationship in January 2006, the Deseret News reported. Yet when they began their relationship, she did not see it having a future, she said. 'It was just for fun,' Willis said. 'It was whenever we could get together. It was just friendly.' As they continued their relationship, she continued to see other men and never considered there was any chance that MacNeill would leave his wife for her, she said. 'He had great respect and love for Michele,' she said. 'He said he had a family and was very happy.' She moved into a duplex that MacNeill owned and provided her with an unlimited credit card to help her get through nursing school, she said. She used it for gas, groceries and coffee.

After the death of Michele MacNeill, which was initially ruled as natural causes, the circumstances of their . relationship changed and Willis said she and her lover began talking . about a future together. 'Martin told me he felt very sorry we . had been involved prior to Michele's death,' she said. 'He was embarrassed about . that. He wanted me to come help him and support him.' But he wanted the children to meet their new nanny in a neutral place, which led to the bizarre circumstances of their first meeting. One of his daughters, Rachel MacNeill, told the court that three days after her mother's funeral, her father asked her to meet him at . the LDS Mount Timpanogos Temple in American Fork. 'He thought it would be a nice place and a calming environment... a conducive way to be introduced to Rachel,' Willis explained. At the temple, he told her he wanted them to pray for guidance about getting a new nanny and, as they left, a woman named Jyllian walked by them, Rachel MacNeill said. Unhappy marriage: Martin MacNeill, left, allegedly gave his wife Michele, right, a cocktail of lethal drugs as she recovered from a face lift. She was found drowned in the bathtub eight days after the operation . Heartbroken: Rachael MacNeill, one of MacNeill's daughters, testified that her father took her to a temple to pray for a nanny before 'bumping' into Willis, who he pretended not to know . Her father pretended as if he could not remember the woman well and did not know her name. He later told his children that he wanted the woman to work as their nanny. 'She didn't do anything that a nanny would do,' Rachel MacNeill said. 'I expected to see what I had seen before (with those who) had been hired as nannies, that their main focus was the children. That they were there to work ... not just sitting and staring at my dad.' After the death of his wife, MacNeill and Willis were convicted of identity fraud and served years in prison for stealing . the identity of MacNeill's 16-year-old adopted daughter. When she left federal prison, Willis was convicted on a state charge but prosecutors agreed not to seek extra jail time - provided she testified against her lover. Yet defense attorney Randy Spencer said he thinks the testimony did little to help their case. Fraud: Martin MacNeill (left) and Willis (right) were convicted of thieving the identity of one of his daughters. In exchange for reduced prison time, Willis agreed to testify in the murder trial . Big family: MacNeill, a doctor and Mormon Sunday school teacher, adopted four children with his wife . 'Mr. MacNeill has done a lot . of bad things in his life,' he said. 'Just because you're a bad man, however, does . not make you a murderer.' While . they were imprisoned, the couple wrote to each other and planned to . make a future but now, 'quite honestly, we have both lost everything', . she said. After the murder, the MacNeill . children fought relentless for police to re-open the case into their . mother's death, certain their father had killed her. An autopsy indicated she died of . natural causes, but a 2010 addendum to that report questioned the manner . of death and authorities . now believe she was drugged by her husband. The unravelling of the MacNeill family . began in 2005 when her father started losing weight, tanning and acting . strangely, even disappearing for days at a time. Stunning: MacNeill allegedly forced his wife Michele, pictured, into having a facelift and gave her a lethal mix of drugs as she was recovering. He found her dead in the bathtub of their home . Doting: Michele was described as a loving mother who did everything for her children and her husband . In 2007, Michele became convinced her husband was . having an affair after she found out the same number had been called over . and over again at strange hours of the morning. A few days later, MacNeill came to his wife with a strange request: He wanted her to have a facelift. Two weeks later, she had the surgery and was back at home recovering with Valium, Percocet, Phenergan and Ambien pills, supplied by her husband. A . few days later, as she struggled with her recovery, she told her daughter: 'In case anything happens to me, . make sure it was not your father.' Michele was found dead in the bathtub just eight days after the surgery. MacNeill . claimed his wife slipped and fell, and he discovered her on returning home from collecting his then six-year-old daughter. 'Killed': Prosecutors say MacNeill did not give his wife CPR, as he had claimed, and purposefully gave the 911 dispatcher the wrong address to further delay emergency responders . In a series of frantic 911 calls, he hung up on the . operator three times in five minutes. He lied to the dispatcher about performing CPR . and gave the wrong address of his residence, which delayed emergency . responders, prosecutors claim. According to an affidavit, Utah State Medical Examiner Todd Grey said the . combination of medicines found in her body, which may have been forced . upon her and could have been lethal. 'When . my father called I knew he'd killed her,' Alexis Somers said. 'I just started screaming he killed her. My father planned . and orchestrated my mother's death and thought he could get away . with it.' Family members have said . they suspect Willis was also involved in Michele MacNeill's death, but . she has not been charged in the case. The . preliminary hearing is expected to finish on Thursday when Judge Samuel . McVey will determine if there is enough evidence to order MacNeill to . stand trial.","Martin MacNeill, 56, 'gave wife Michele lethal cocktail of drugs before she was found drowned in the bath at their home' in 2007 .

A 29-year-old aspiring model and actor who is also believed to be a martial arts expert with a black belt in karate has been charged with the killing of 19-year-old University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott. Although her body has not yet been found, police announced that Marriott is believed to be dead, Assistant Attorney General . James Vara said on Saturday. And today, Seth Mazzaglia, 29, of Dover, was charged with the second-degree murder of the missing student as her distraught family were tragically told to call off their frantic search. University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth . 'Lizzi' Marriott vanished on her way to visit a friend on Tuesday - . police now believe she is dead . Last night hundreds of friends and family members attended an emotional candlelit vigil for Lizzi at the Bay State Commons. Her devastated father Robert Marriott and best friend Meghan Hoyt were among those pictured at the solemn evening held in tribute to the young student. Aspiring actor and model Seth Mazzaglia is scheduled to appear on Monday morning at Dover District Court on a second degree murder charge.

Seth Mazzaglia (left and right) of Dover, who is . a struggling actor has been arrested and charged with the murder of . missing student Lizzi Marriott . The announcement of the arrest and declaration that Marriott was in all probability dead came at 1 p.m., and family members were informed that they should 'stand down' their search for their loved one. Marriott's aunt, Rebecca Tyning, confirmed that authorities told them to stop their search before the afternoon announcement. In a phone interview with Foster's Daily Democrat, Tyning called the announcement of her niece's death 'surreal.' Marriott was a marine biology major who lived with her aunt in Chester. She was a 2011 graduate of Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She had attended a class at the university on Tuesday night and made plans to visit a friend in Dover. Police tracked down the friends, who said Lizzi never arrived that evening. Hunt: New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jane Young holds a 'missing' flyer of Lizzi on Friday . Authorities have also analysed her cell phone records - and those of her friends - and discovered she texted a friend at 10.11pm on Tuesday, saying she was on her way to Dover. But that was the last activity on her phone and her bank accounts have not been accessed since. The suspect, Seth J. Mazzaglia is listed as living at apartment 341 in the complex of 1 Mill St. in Dover. His website indicates that he is an 'experienced actor, writer and fight choreographer' who stands 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 220 pounds. He claims that his 'special skills and talents' include a third degree black belt in Okinawan karate and that he is proficient with a samurai sword, butterfly swords and other hand held weapons. Robert Modee, who is a Kittery, Maine, martial arts instructor, confirmed that Mazzaglia is an expert in karate and that he trained with the suspect for almost 20-years. 'He's been with me, training with me, since he was probably 10 or 12 years old,' Modee said. Indeed, just before his arrest, Mazzaglia had been giving martial arts lessons to children at the Kittery Community Center said Modee. 'I don't understand what's going on right now,' Modee said. 'I'm completely floored with all this. I don't even know what to think.' Scene: She was last seen at an evening class at the University of New Hampshire before driving to Dover . As well as his expertise in hand to hand combat, Mazzaglia claimed to have performed in 17 theater productions between 2000 and 2010. In 2005, Mazzaglia played the role of Richie Valens in a July performance of 'The Buddy Holly Story,' at Seacoast Repertory Theatre. One former cast member, Brett Wulfson said she remembered Mazzaglia as a pleasant man, 'very involved with self-defence.' In addition, Mazzaglia claims to have a 750 hour certification in massage therapy awarded by McIntosh College in 2007. Marriott was a 2011 graduate of Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She lived with an aunt in Chester and commuted to the Durham campus. A message seeking comment was left with her parents, Robert and Melissa Marriott of Westborough, Mass.

Emergency surgery: Gaby Scanlon was celebrating her 18th birthday when she fell ill . A teenage girl who had her stomach . removed and 'nearly died' after drinking a cocktail containing liquid . nitrogen was the victim of a 'irresponsible alcohol industry,' according . to senior health bosses. Gaby Scanlon had been drinking with . friends at a wine bar to celebrate her 18th birthday when she was bought . two 'Nitro Jagermeister' cocktails. She downed both drinks in quick succession and very quickly felt unwell. The A-level student became very breathless and then doubled over with 'horrendous stomach pains' before an ambulance was called. The teenager was rushed to hospital where doctors diagnosed a perforated stomach. Suffering intense pain, she was rushed into theatre where surgeons were forced to remove most of her stomach to save her life. The student was said to be 'doing . well' after the emergency operation but is set to remain in hospital for . some time and will face specialist medical treatment for the rest of . her life. At the weekend the teenager was . apparently well enough last night to write on Twitter: 'Maybe stay off . the liquid nitrogen' is not a f****** funny thing to say to me.' She . also tweeted: 'I nearly died.' Both tweets were later removed from the website. But last night Dr John Ashton, . director of public health for Cumbria, said she was a victim of a . dangerous gimmick used to sell more alcohol. He said: 'This girl is the victim of an irresponsible alcohol industry that's now competing on gimmicks. 'People should not be playing . chemistry in public houses. This is a very, very cold substance and it . is similar to subjecting your oesophagus and stomach to frost bite. Cooling cocktail:  Liquid nitrogen is used in some luxury cocktails and is known for freezing everything it comes into contact with . 'As this case highlights there are . major safety implications and it is time there was better regulation put . in place to prevent things like this dreadful incident happening . again.' He said a total ban would only lead to . increased demand for the dangerous cocktails but said there should be . 'stringent regulation.' Consultant gastroenterologists say the . teenager will face a lifetime of specialist medical treatment in order . to live a normal life. As well as being unable to digest . certain things Miss Scanlon will have to avoid some sugary foods and . drinks and have regular vitamin injections. Investigation: Lancashire Police said the Oscars wine bar have ceased selling the liquid nitrogen cocktail . Popularised by celebrity chef, Heston . Blumenthal, liquid nitrogen - which vapourises at -196C - has been . increasingly used in recent years in the preparation of drinks. It is used to chill glasses and is a crowd-pleaser thanks to the dramatic-looking water vapour it releases at room temperature. But it is highly dangerous and can . cause very serious cold burns if it comes into contact with skin or . tissue and should never be ingested. It is believed the cocktails drunk by . the Miss Scanlon still contained drops of the liquid nitrogen which then . caused horrendous burns to her stomach. Last night her mother Lisa Hensall, . 38, was said to be too upset about the incident to speak but her . stepfather Ian Henshall, 40, said the family were hoping for a quick . recovery. Trendy: TV chef Heston Blumenthal has pioneered the use of liquid nitrogen in his restaurants including making ice-cream using it . Mr Henshall said: 'She is our main concern at the moment and we are just concentrating on her getting better.' Dr Ashton said it was time the Government brought in better regulation of the drinks industry to stop such tragic incidents. He said: 'It is shocking that a . teenage girl goes out to celebrate her 18th birthday and ends up in . intensive care with life-changing injuries. 'The alcohol industry uses these types . of gimmicks to make alcoholic drinks more enticing - yet staff can use . liquid nitrogen without any proper training. Liquid nitrogen is formed by cooling down the harmless gas nitrogen to such a low temperature that it becomes liquid. It is intensely cold (-196°C) and if not used properly can cause frostbite or cryogenic burns when it comes into contact with living tissue. Professor Peter Barham, of the University of Bristol's School of Physics, said: 'As with any very hot or very cold liquid proper safety measures must be taken - just as no-one would drink boiling water or oil or pour it over themselves, so no-one should ingest liquid nitrogen. 'Liquid nitrogen can be used safely in the preparation of foods. However, since it is not safe to ingest liquid nitrogen due care must be taken to ensure that the liquid has all evaporated before serving any food or drink that was prepared with liquid nitrogen.' In fact, liquid nitrogen is used in cryotherapy medical treatment to burn away skin abnormalities, such as warts. But it will have the same effect if consumed, burning internal tissue in the stomach. Where the burn causes a hole or perforation in the stomach wall it will allow gastric acid to leak into the abdominal cavity, which can be fatal. This is a surgical emergency and in cases where the damage can't be repaired, the stomach will have to be removed. The oesophagus, the muscular tube that transports the food, is connected directly to the small bowel. In the short term a feeding tube may be necessary. But surprisingly, the body soon adapts to digesting food without a stomach, where the food is normally stored and mixed during the initial phase of digestion. The small intestine will act more like a stomach over time and keep food there for longer while it is broken down. Most normal foods can be eaten after a total gastrectomy - whole stomach removal - but in smaller portions and more frequently. The operation is most often performed in cancer patients. Doctors may advise avoiding meals made up of foods high in added sugar. This is because food will be entering the bowel rapidly and sugar-laden foods exacerbate the problem, potentially causing a transitory drop in blood pressure and unpleasant symptoms such as feeling dizzy or faint. People without a stomach need to have regular injections of vitamin B12 as the stomach controls its absorption and deficiency can lead to anaemia. 'These things are allowed to continue in this country because of the Government's lack on control over the drinks industry. 'Essentially it amounts to a form of . cowardice because there are drinks industry interests in every . constituency and the Government is worried about repercussions.' He said it was time dangerous . substances like liquid nitrogen formed part of the licensing application . with staff being properly trained to handle it. The incident happened last Thursday . when Miss Scanlon went out to Oscar's winebar in Lancaster with friends . to celebrate her 18th birthday. Shortly before 11pm she was bought two . 'Nitro Jagermeister' cocktails costing £8.95 and she downed them both . with the space of a few minutes. She very quickly began to complain of a . horrific pain in her stomach and severe breathlessness and was rushed . to Lancaster Royal Infirmary by paramedics. The management of the wine bar has . stopped all liquid nitrogen cocktails and were said to be 'tremendously . concerned' for the teenager. The sixth-form student lives with her . family in a quiet cul-de-sac in a semi-detached home on the outskirts of . Lancaster in the village of Heysham. Liz Nicholls, principal at Ripley St . Thomas Church of England Academy, says the teenager is one of their . 'most hardworking and mature students' She said: 'Our whole school community . is shocked and upset at what has happened. 'Our thoughts and prayers are . with Gaby, her family and her friends who are obviously upset and . distressed. We are pleased to hear that she is making better than . expected progress.' Coun Paul Aitchison, chairman of . Lancaster City Council's Licensing Act Committee, said that he was at . the same bar a few months ago and tried the Nitro Jagermeister drink. Mr Aitchison, who at 20 is one of the . country's youngest councillors, said: 'I heard about this and I was . quite shocked because I have actually tried it myself. 'I thought it sounded interesting, . that's probably one of the draws. You assume the drinks served in . licensed premises will be safe. 'I didn't have an adverse reaction to it. It was quite scary to think that it could have possibly happened to me.' A number of witnesses at the wine bar . were interviewed by police and the premises has stopped selling drinks . containing the liquid gas. A spokesman for Lancashire Police . said: 'Medical opinion is that this would have proved fatal had the . operation not been carried out urgently. 'The investigation is still in its . early stages and we are still interviewing witnesses to establish the . full facts. The premises involved have fully co-operated with all . agencies and have suspended drinks involving liquid nitrogen.'","Gaby Scanlon had been drinking at a bar in Lancaster to celebrate her 18th birthday when she was left feeling breathless .

Police have for the first time released photos of the couple who were jailed for breaking a baby girl’s legs and fracturing her skull, leaving her with permanent brain damage. Grzegorze Lis, 35, was jailed for 10 years nine months last week for the attack on an eight-week-old girl which has left her blind and deaf and in need of around-the-clock care. His partner Joanna Skrodzka, 22, will spend two years in jail for child cruelty after refusing to alert authorities while the child was left in agony for almost a week in a bid to protect Lis, St Albans Crown Court heard. Pictured for the first time: Police have released these photos of Grzegorze Lis (right) and Joanna Skrodzka (left) after they were jailed last week following a brutal attack on an eight-week-old girl . Hertfordshire Police released the pictures of the couple, who shared a flat in The Maltings, Hemel Hempstead, today. The court heard last Friday that the injuries to the baby, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were inflicted by Lis. Both the baby’s legs were broken at the lower shin area close to the ankles. Both thigh bones had also been broken. Jane Bickerstaff QC, prosecuting, told how in March the girl - born just two months earlier - was attacked and violently assaulted by unemployed Lis on a number of occasions. Child cruelty: Lis, 35, was jailed for 10 years nine months at St Albans Crown Court (pictured) for the attack which left the baby with permanent brain damage requiring 24-hour care while Skrodzka was jailed for two years for refusing to alert authorities . The child suffered a fractured skull caused by a massive impact injury and there was evidence that she had been violently shaken in a separate incident causing bleeding on the brain and leaving her starved of oxygen, which left her blind. The child had been severely bitten on her left forearm by Polish-born Lis. But Skrodzka, who is also Polish-born, turned a blind eye to the terrible pain the baby was suffering, the judge was told. As a result, no medical help was given to the little girl. It was not until almost a week later that staff at Watford General Hospital saw the baby for the first time and she was immediately transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. In passing sentence, recorder Amanda Tipples, who had presided over Skrodzka’s trial, told her: 'You failed to get any medical help for her even though you were aware something terrible had happened to her and she was unwell.' Violently shaken: Left without medical care for almost a week, the child was eventually taken to Watford General Hospital before being transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital (pictured) with 'one of the worst cases of brain damage,' a doctor said at the trial . She said a 'right thinking person' would not have waited more than five minutes once they was realised the child was ill. Recorder Tipples said that she thought the injuries had been inflicted sometime between Thursday, March 1, or Friday, March 2, this year by Lis. Lis was jailed last Monday for two offences of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the baby girl with intent and causing her actual bodily harm. During Skrodzka’s trial, expert evidence was given by a doctor that in 600 cases he had been involved in, this was one of the worst cases of brain damage he had ever seen where the child had survived. The court heard how the child is now incontinent because of her injuries and will need 24-hour care for the rest of her life.","Grzegorze Lis was jailed for 10 years for attacking an eight-week-old girl .

He may fall foul of the new guidelines if it spreads to other forces . Police recruits to Britain's largest force were banned yesterday from having visible tattoos in a sweeping reform of its public image. Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said body art that can be seen by the public 'damages the professional image' of the service. And he ordered a 'tattoo amnesty' in which anyone who already has marks on their hands, neck or face must declare them within weeks or be sacked.The ban comes amid increasing concern among senior ranks nationwide over complaints from crime victims that some young officers appear 'thuggish'. They are particularly worried about the trend for tattoo 'sleeves' in which wrap-around tattoos are inked along the arm. But rank-and-file representatives claim associating tattoos with criminals is old-fashioned and police should reflect the public they serve. One Police Federation official said: 'If tattoos are offensive they should be covered but there is a bit of a generational attitude to them. 'Some see them as artwork and some don't. Tattoos are popular with high-profile footballers and pop stars. Many people we deal with also have them.' Mr Hogan-Howe announced the tattoo diktat in a message to all 52,000 officers and staff yesterday. He said: 'All visible tattoos damage the professional image of the Metropolitan Police Service. Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe reviews some of the newly graduated police officers at the Hendon police academy, London. He has banned police recruits from having visible tattoos . Rank-and-file representatives of the police claim associating tattoos with criminals is old-fashioned and police should reflect the public they serve . The Met is believed to be the first force to actively ban people with visible tattoos of any kind from joining the frontline . 'This corporate announcement discusses a specific requirement from the Met dress code policy in relation to the display of tattoos. 'With effect from the date of this announcement, tattoos on the face, or visible above a collar line, or on the hands are not permitted. All other tattoos must be covered. 'It's an old-fashioned attitude to ban . tattoos, so many have them done now that people do not look twice. It's . very strange thing to do in 2012.' Tattooist Lionel Titchener . 'The Met is aware that some officers . and staff already have prohibited visible tattoos. These are defined as . tattoos that cannot be covered by everyday clothing. 'It will be a requirement, by the . Commissioner, that all officers and police staff with existing tattoos . defined as 'visible' must register such tattoos as a formal written . declaration to their line manager before November 12. 'Any . officer or member of police staff who fails, without reasonable excuse, . to declare and register an existing visible tattoo will be liable to . disciplinary action. 'Such a failure is liable to be considered to be gross misconduct.' Police officers are banned from having offensive tattoos, including ones with discriminatory, violent or intimidating slogans. Many forces say they will deal with tattooed recruits on a case by case basis, with the quantity, size and prominence of markings taken into consideration. But the Met is believed to be the . first force to actively ban people with visible tattoos of any kind from . joining the frontline and other forces may follow its lead. The . 'tattoo amnesty' means officers who already have such tattoos will not . be able to secretly add to them without breaking the new rule. Met . officers have already questioned how officers from islands in the South . Pacific where cultural tattoos are common will be affected. And they highlighted that many servicemen may find they are unable to join the police after leaving the Armed Forces. Last year, Ian Pointon, chairman of the Kent Police Federation, said tattoos can act as an 'icebreaker' when dealing with the public. He said tattoos can be a 'good way' of opening a line of communication with the public and do not carry a stigma. A police officer in London said: 'A lot of my colleagues have tattoos on their arms but they just have to wear long sleeve shirts. 'I fail to see how tattoos offend people. 'Saying someone is thuggish because they have a tattoo is like saying someone is a racist because they have a shaved head.' Lionel Titchener, 59, founder of the Tattoo Club of Great Britain, said he has tattooed dozens of police officers during his career. He said: 'I'm based in Oxford and when Thames Valley Police changed their badge we had a lot of people come in to have it done. 'I've tattooed police women as well. Often they go back to work and their colleagues turn up a few days later asking for the same thing. 'It's an old-fashioned attitude to ban tattoos, so many have them done now that people do not look twice. It's very strange thing to do in 2012.'","Bernard .

"PUBLISHED: . 07:31 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:22 EST, 18 October 2012 . A British woman and an Irishman facing three years in jail for allegedly having sex in the back of a Dubai taxi today denied the charges in court. High-flying executive Rebecca Blake and Irish welder Conor McRedmond appeared before a judge to face charges of having sex before marriage - a crime punishable by jail in the Islamic United Arab Emirates - indecency and drinking alcohol. They pleaded not guilty to the two sex charges but admitted they had been drinking for ten hours before they were arrested. The court had earlier heard that Blake had been seen removing clothing and 'going up and down on McRedmond's thigh'. Allegations: Welder Conor McRedmond and Rebecca Blake pictured at a previous court appearance . Pretty Blake, 29, who wore an Islamic hijab at her last court appearance but attended today with her head uncovered, was summonsed to stand before the judges' bench at Dubai Criminal Court with McRedmond, 28, instead of standing in the defendants' dock. Judge Abdulaziz Mohammad Al Saadni said via a court translator: 'You are charged with a breach of honour by carrying out a consensual illegal act and that in a taxi you took off your clothes on Sheikh Zayed road and engaged in an indecent act.' The pair shook their heads when the two charges - the first relating to having consensual sex and the second to stripping off in public - were read out in court. When the translator read out a third charge relating to consumption of alcohol, Blake, who pleaded guilty, said: 'I had been drinking all day.' Grey-suited McRedmond, of Tullamore, County Offaly, added: 'I had been drinking all day too.' Emotional rollercoaster: The strain is obvious on Blake's face as she learns she has lost her job over the incident (left) - a far cry from the happy-go-lucky girl she was in this earlier picture (right) But the court heard Blake stripped naked and was seen 'going up and down on McRedmond's thigh' on the back seat of the taxi. The Pakistani driver alleges he heard Blake 'making the sounds of a woman having sex'. Their lawyer Shaker Al Shammary asked to present their defence but the judge, who was standing in as a substitute, adjourned the case to give them a chance of a fair trial before a permanent judge. Blake, who was smartly dressed in a beige tailored jacket and black skirt for the five-minute hearing, was sacked from her £100,000-a-year job as a recruitment consultant for Manpower in Dubai following the scandal. The pair were arrested on May 4 after a 10-hour drinking binge when a taxi driver, apparently disgusted by their frolicking on the back seat, pulled over and called on a patrolling policeman to intervene. In a police statement, the taxi driver said: ‘I saw the man drinking alcohol and I told him it’s not allowed. But he drank it and threw the glass out of the window. ‘I looked in the mirror and saw the woman sitting on the man’s thighs. She was naked and going up and down, making sounds of a woman having sex.’ The driver stopped on the side of the road when he spotted a police officer. He added: ‘The policeman asked me to follow him to the police station and on the way the woman offered me a big amount of money if I just said that they were kissing and not having sex. But I refused and told the truth to the investigators.’ In his statement, the police officer added: ‘The male defendant’s trousers was down to the knee and the woman wasn’t wearing any underwear. ‘They had sex for four minutes and then I knocked on the glass so they stopped and got dressed.’ Blake was . sacked from her £100,000-a-year job as a recruitment consultant for . Manpower in Dubai following the scandal . Strict Islamic state: Briton Rebecca Black and . Irishman Conor McRedmond are said to have engaged in a drunken tryst . after leaving a bar in Dubai . Both the taxi driver and policeman are . expected to give evidence. Although the couple have denied having sex . or stripping in the cab, Blake admitted after her arrest that she was . 'no saint' and had drunk so much, the whole incident was a 'blur'. Blake . from Dorking, Surrey, had started drinking at midday at a hotel brunch . with free-flowing wine, then indulged in a happy hour session at the bar . before moving to the Irish Village, where she met McRedmond and carried . on drinking with him. They . left the bar at 10.30pm and were arrested within minutes. The policeman . who approached the cab said he saw Blake naked on the back seat with . 'the man hugging her'. When he was arrested, McRedmond told officers he had been hugging Blake because she was 'sad'. Blake, . who has been living in Dubai for a year and has had her passport . confiscated, previously told The Sun newspaper: 'I like to party and I . like to drink. I'm a single girl with a good job and I am no saint.' The pair were held for five days in cockroach-infested Dubai custody cells after their arrest, described by Blake as 'hell'. 'It was vile - the worst nightmare you could possibly imagine,' she said at the time. Both defendants have been released on bail. Consensual sex and indecency each carry a prison term of between one month and three years while consumption of alcohol is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to £340. Foreigners who spend time behind bars are deported as soon as their sentence is completed. The case was adjourned until November 1. Mr Al Shammary said outside court that he expects the pair to be acquitted of the sex-related charges.","Taxi driver claims Rebecca Blake had sex with Irish welder Conor McRedmond's thigh during cab ride .

Forza has long been the jewel in Microsoft's crown - a racing series renowned for its poise and technical grace. But from the moment you’re plunged into the seat of a Dodge Viper racing to a techno-filled race festival, it’s clear that Forza has had a complete engine overhaul. What's immediately apparent is Forza Horizon’s vast open world. This forms the backdrop of a narrative - which, although predictable, is a welcome addition to the series. Stunning: The game boasts a smooth frame-rate backed up with beautiful looks . It gives an RPG feel to proceedings with a focus on attaining XP. This can be achieved in a number of ways, from racing and showcase events, to the more bizarre knocking down road signs and getting clocked on speed cameras. The points you earn can then be spent on buying new cars, upgrading your existing vehicle and unlocking new events. There are also lots of hidden cars, often degrading in some barren part of the map. Once found, you can get them fixed - and with classics such as the BMW M1 or Aston Martin DB5 available, there's plenty of incentive to find them. Although racing in Horizon is sharp and responsive, it hasn't evolved as much as expected. It is still relatively linear (bar changes in track surface) but feels more arcade-like than its previous incarnates. There’s even a popularity mechanic that keeps a tally on how you are driving. Burnouts, drifts, slipstreaming and other flashy moves earn you points. You start as the lowest ranked racer, No 250, but as you move up the ladder, extra events and perks are unlocked. Head to head: Races can be tough at first but AI is easily tweaked . Some events require different cars to enter, and there's the ability to change AI difficulty and driving assists before each one. The showcase events, however, are wonderfully inventive. These see you racing planes, hot air balloons and performing tricks to win popularity. Online, the showcase events are event better, with a car version of hide and seek a particular highlight. To stave off monotony, there are lots of different outposts to discover which can teleport you around the game world. Also, any other racers that you encounter during your travels can be challenged. This brings about a mini game where you race to a point on your GPS as fast as possible. Graphically, the game is wonderful. There’s a well-constructed day and night cycle which really impacts the races, while draw distance is impressive-enough to not ruin any of the sweeping vistas. Although a barren land, Horizon does offer small settlements dotted around the map. It’s these that are the game’s graphical weakness, coming across as bland, lifeless and lacking any real detail. Dangerous driver: You'll be awarded popularity points for driving recklessly . However, you’ll often be driving through them so fast that it doesn't really take away from the experience. But this is one of the finest racing games ever made – providing a much-needed spark to a lagging series and making the most out of its open-nature premise.

It is the first time the social networking site has implemented its local censorship policy, which came into force in January. 'Injustice': Besseres Hanover, or Better Hanover, have hit back over their tweets being censored in Germany - writing in English on Twitter, where they normally tweet in their own language . Only visible abroad: The account is the first to be banned by the social networking site under its local censorship rules, which came in at the start of this year . Besseres Hannover - Better Hanover - is an outlawed Hitler-worshipping group that routinely called for a Fourth Reich, the expulsion of immigrants and new round-ups of Jews. Several of its members are facing criminal charges for denying the Holocaust and promoting racial hatred. It was police in the state of Lower Saxony who approached central government in Berlin asking it to silence the 'voices of racial abuse.' The coalition administration led by Chancellor Angela Merkel then instructed lawyers to contact Twitter. Twitter's chief lawyer, Alex Macgillivray, said: 'We are acting against a group deemed illegal in Germany. With hundreds of millions of Tweets posted every day around the world, our goal is to respect our users' expression, while also taking into consideration applicable local laws. 'Many countries, including the United States, have laws that may apply to Tweets and/or Twitter account content.

Modern technologies such as social networking sites are useful tools for German neo-Nazis, who are growing in strength on the back of the euro crisis and xenophobia stoked by Germany bearing the financial brunt of bailing out struggling countries such as Greece. While they are severely restricted in what they can say and do in Germany, because of postwar laws designed to prevent the future glorification of the Nazis and their works, the Internet links them to literature, songs and like-minded souls across the globe where laws are not so strict - particularly in America. The move in Germany to silence hatemongers came after a controversy over anti-Semitic tweets in France.","Account is now only visible to users outside Germany .

Ayman al-Zawahri the leader of Al Qaeda has urged Muslims to wage holy war against the United States and Israel over a film that insulted Islam's Prophet Muhammad . The recording appeared on the Mujahedin al-Ansar website which carries statements from al Qaeda leaders.

A mother claims she has spent a tiring three years struggling to make her 12-year-old son attend school because he doesn't like homework and finds it 'boring'. When her son Ajay was younger, Miranda Hammond used to pull him out of bed, dress him and push him through the school gates. But as he is nearly a teen, Ms Hammond, 37, says he is 'much bigger and stronger' and 'built like a mini rugby player', making it physically impossible for her to force him to learn. Miranda Hammond, left, has battled for three years to get her son Ajay, 12, right, to attend school but he refuses . She now faces hefty fines and being . hauled before a court because of her son's truancy. And surprisingly, . the mother-of-four says she would welcome the decision. Ms Hammond, from Plymouth, Devon, said: 'I’m happy to go to court if that means I will get some help.' She said she needs help to force her . son to go to school and insists she will go to court if that is what it . takes. She said: 'There has got to be 'some sort of change'. She added: 'I’ve been trying my hardest, I used to . pull him out of bed and get him dressed, push him in the car and . through the school gates, but I can’t do that anymore. Mischievous: Despite Ajay's mother, right, facing hefty fines and court action, he still won't go to school . Ivybridge Community College, Devon, which Ajay attends just once a week . A mother who refused to pay a fine for taking her son out of school in term time to attend her wedding in the Caribbean lost her court battle today. Frances Harden (pictured), 31, fell foul of anti truancy laws after teenager Harrison Thorpe (left) was taken out of classes for 11 days so he could walk his mother down the aisle. Mrs Harden had originally booked her £8,000 ceremony at a four star hotel in St Lucia in 2011 in the belief this year's event would be taking place during the Easter holidays. But when she realised the Easter holidays for 2012 differed by up to two weeks, Mrs Harden repeatedly tried to email Harrison's headmistress Dr Rose Hegan at the 1,397 pupil Marple Hall School in Stockport, Greater Manchester to alert her. She was eventually refused permission to take Harrison to the paradise ceremony - only a month before it was due to take place. Mrs Harden pressed ahead and took Harrison anyway and was then issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice under anti truancy laws upon her return from the 14 day trip. Her younger son Alex, six, was allowed out of classes by his primary school for the luxury ceremony. Today at Stockport Magistrates' Court Mrs Harden pleaded guilty under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act after she refused to pay the fixed penalty. 'I’m 5ft 3in and he’s much bigger and stronger, he’s built like a mini rugby player. 'He also knows the law and says that if I touch him that it’s assault. I’m at my wits’ end.' Ms Hammond was given an official warning last week and if her son's truancy is not curbed she has been told she could face the courts. Ajay is in Year 8 at Ivybridge . Community College but attends on average just one day a week. Ms Hammond . said she called a meeting on Friday to discuss the issue further. The meeting was held in Ms . Hammond’s car because Ajay refused to get out and go into the school . building. Now Ajay needs to attend school every day for four weeks under the ‘fast track to attendance’ scheme. Any unauthorised absence will result in a £60 penalty notice which Ms Hammond will have to pay. Miss Hammond said: 'However Ajay did not go in to school on Monday or Tuesday. 'Why are they prosecuting me when it should be him?' 'If you’ve got a child that’s stronger and bigger than you then what more can I do?' Miranda . has three other children aged 20, 18, and seven, and she said all of . them have regularly attended school with one currently at college. She . said: 'I’ve had enough and I’m absolutely sick of it. I’m going to . write a letter to David Cameron. 'I don’t understand what the problem is, . something needs to be done, there must be other parents in my position. There’s just got to be some sort of change. 'It’s . not fair, we need to fight back for changes to get some help. Why . should I be prosecuted when I haven’t done anything wrong?' She said the problems started when she fell 30ft down a quarry while Ajay and her youngest son were there. 'I thought he may be worried about me but it’s been going on for years now. 'Then it was homework, then it was boring. He’s very headstrong and does what he wants.' Miranda has tried to make Ajay’s life . at home unappealing in a hope that will make him go in, but she says . that’s not helping either. 'I’m . doing everything I possibly can, I take everything away to make it . boring for him and I don’t let him go to football training. 'Meetings . are all well and good but where is the action? Police officers have . come and he runs off, he hides in the woods, and then they go,' she . said. He still finds it funny: Ms Hammond held a meeting with school officials in her car because her stubborn son won't go near the building . Plymouth City Council prosecuted 67 parents for their child’s irregular attendance during the last academic year. Of the 67 council prosecutions this year, 24 were as a result of parents not paying the penalty notice. Devon County Council issued 203 penalty notices during the last academic year, with 143 prosecutions. Asked about Ms Hammond’s case, a spokesman for Devon County Council said: 'Parents have the ultimate responsibility to ensure their child attends school. 'Education welfare officers will work with schools and colleges to try and help with specific issues resulting in why students are not attending.' A spokeswoman for Ivybridge Community College said: 'We monitor attendance on a daily basis to promote the good habit of punctuality and good attendance. 'We have a robust system to track and support any students who may be absent. This begins with parents contacting the college if their child is absent and is further supported by an automated service to our parents.'","Miranda Hammond has spent 3 years trying to make son Ajay go to school .

Law enforcement sources have revealed that authorities investigating the death of Sage Stallone believe he was a drug dealer. Insiders have apparently  told TMZ that it is thought that a 'likely scenario' is Sage was dealing Hydrocodone- more commonly known as Vicodin- but not an addict himself. A key factor in this theory is said to be the late actor's weight. At 188lbs and 5'7"", Sage didn't have the thin frame which is usually a trait of addicts. TMZ was reportedly  told: 'He was pudgy, and drug addicts are almost always rail thin.' New evidence: Law enforcement sources have revealed that authorities investigating the death of Sage Stallone believe he was a drug dealer . The website's source claims that no . Hydrocodone tablets were found in Sages house, but that there were over . 60 gigantic empty prescription bottles. Each of these would have held 500 pills, meaning that Sage would have had over 30,000. LAPD detectives and L.A. County Coroner investigators will apparently . use batch numbers and serial numbers to track down the bottles, but it . is thought highly probably that they were shipped from abroad. The bags of white powder found in the room where Sage died have not yet been tested, but it is said to be likely that they contained Hydrocodone. Sage will reportedly be laid to rest in a private service at the weekend. A source told RadarOnline.com: 'Sage will be buried on Saturday. His body was picked up from the coroner by a mortuary that is based in Westwood earlier this week. The funeral will be private and it will be family and friends only and will be celebration of his life.' Meanwhile a close friend of Sylvester Stallone's late son has come forward to say that the 36-year-old did not take his own life. Stephen Wozniak claims that Sage Stallone had no intention of . committing suicide, and had been making plans for the future with him . shortly before his demise. Wozniak told TMZ: 'It was absolutely not suicide.' He added: ' I'm certain that this really . horrible thing that happened was an accident. It could have been . anything - but nothing like suicide. I knew him pretty well.' 'I spoke to him a few weeks ago. We talked about resurrecting a film we worked on, other projects, talked about his girlfriend and time they'd spent together. We talked about my wedding and he seemed to be thinking about it.' Searching for the truth: A grief-stricken Sylvester Stallone is claimed to have hired a private investigator to look into what happened to son Sage . While Wozniak does believe that Sage . suffered from depression, he is adamant that the actor and director did . not react to the problem with substance abuse. 'He would have withdrawal and get depressed,' he told E! News. 'He . would try to overcompensate. He would try to clown around and I know . that those are things people do, medicate or wake up. He was no . different. Very few people were telling him, 'Don't do that.' I did. He . was very resistant when you would tell him that. It was a sore point . with him.' Wozniak's claims . are at odds with those of Sage's mother, Sylvester's first wife Sasha . Czack, who has blamed the painkillers her son was using after recent . dental surgery for his death. Probe: The actor has hired Scott Ross, who has previously worked on the Chris Brown and Rihanna case, and Michael Jackson molestation case . Bags of white powder were found in the room where Sage Stallone died, it has been claimed. Law enforcement sources allegedly told TMZ . that detectives at the scene discovered 'several little baggies'. Tests . are being conducted to see if it could be cocaine or crushed Vicodin, . the website reports. There were no obvious signs of the white powder of Sage's body, when he was found dead in his Los Angeles apartment last Friday. It was earlier reported how huge empty . prescription bottles were found in Sage's bedroom. It is now being . claimed that '60 gigantic bottles, like the ones in pharmacies,' were . unearthed, TMZ reports. Part of the investigation is finding . out how Sage got hold of such a large quantity of prescription . medication - which included Hydrocodone, generic Vicodin - a . prescription medication used to treat moderate to severe pain, but which . is also used as a recreational drug. The news comes as Sage's father . Sylvester Stallone hired a private investigator to discover exactly what . happened to his late son. According to TMZ, . the actor, 66, has met with top P.I. Scott Ross in an effort to . understand what led to the tragic death of Sage Stallone last week. The website reports that Ross was . called to Stallone's home to discuss the investigation with the actor, . his brother Frank and an L.A. County Coroner representative. Ross was behind the probes into the Chris Brown/Rihanna battery case and Michael Jackson molestation case. While . it is widely believed that Sage, who was 36, overdosed on painkillers . following dental surgery, Stallone wants to know if he was using drugs . or drinking alcohol in the lead up to his death, it is claimed. According to TMZ, Ross has a history of working with Stallone and is a trusted friend. Sage . was found dead in his home last Friday night, with bottles of pills . scattered all over his room, the L.A. County Coroner reported. Life cut short: Sage died in his Hollywood home from a suspected drug overdose . Toxicology results are expected within four to six weeks. Yesterday, . Sage's mother Sasha Czak revealed her belief that he had accidentally . overdosed on pain medication following extensive dental work. In . her first public comments on her son Sage's death, Czak said she had . begged him not to have so much dental work carried out in one day. She said her son had five teeth extracted two weeks before he was found dead at his Hollywood home last Friday. Czak, Stallone's first wife, said she had warned her son about having so much dental work carried out in one sitting. A mother's agony: Sage's mother Sasha Czak, seen here with him in February 1991, said yesterday that her son may have overdosed on painkillers after undergoing extensive dental surgery . 'I . told him not to do that. I've heard about people dying having multiple . procedures done to you mouth. Do not have more than one tooth (pulled),' she told the New York Post. When asked if her son would be taking pain medication, she added: 'Wouldn't you be.' Hollywood . star Stallone who is said to be grief stricken by Sage’s death released . an emotional statement talking about  his 'agonising' loss. He said: 'When a parent loses a child there is no greater pain... This agonizing loss will be felt for the rest of our lives. 'Sage . was our first child and the centre of our universe and I am humbly . begging for all to have my son's memory in full left in peace.' Father and son: Sage starred alongside Sly in the 1990 film Rocky V . Los Angeles coroner Ed Winter has denied reports that Sage was living in squalor when his body was found. One report said he was surrounded by rubbish and cigarette butts and had become a recluse. 'Sage . Stallone wasn't living in squalor. His home wasn't unordinarily messy. It seemed to be a typical male messiness. Mr. Stallone did have a . housekeeper,' Winter told website Radaronline. Although foul play is not suspected Los Angeles detectives are helping out in the investigation. Sage’s lawyer has said he was planning to get married and was not depressed.

A zoo where keepers killed animals using baseball bats and crowbars - in a bid to save on veterinary fees - has now been accused of feeding parts of the dead creatures to Polish guest workers. Former employees at the park revealed the horrific living conditions of the animals at Ölands Animal and Amusement Park in Sweden earlier this week, but now it seems the atrocious treatment extend to the staff as well. Employees at the popular tourist attraction were forced to work under ‘slave like’ conditions and were fed goats, hens and even a pig that had been put down at the park. Accusations: Staff at Ölands Zoo allegedly beat an Brazilian aardvark to death, starved lion cubs and fed Polish workers zoo-animals . One worker, identified as Anna, said: ‘Sometimes we would give the animals a . small injection afterwards. If there was an inspection no one would . notice that they had been put down the wrong way. They often kill goats with a simple knife to the throat.' Guest workers from Poland and Bulgaria . work in the zoo over the summer and live in cramped . conditions close to the park, located on the popular tourist island in the Baltic sea. Animal carer Mats told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet: ‘People say the animals are treated badly, but if they only knew what the situation is like for the employees. ‘The guest staff work under slave-like . conditions, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, with no entitlement to . sick leave or days off. Those who complain have to take the return bus . back home.’ Horrible conditions: Guest workers were fed goats and hens which had been killed in the park (file photo) Food is included in the contract and . Niclas, another former employee, revealed that the guest workers were fed animals that had been put down in the park, giving . examples of a goat and hens. He reveals he once butchered a pig at the zoo to give the workers meat, adding: ‘They were so hungry and hadn't had any nutritious food for weeks.' Anna added: ‘They often had to eat monkey food. Old bread and old fruit which had been donated to the park by local . grocers on the island, or nearby Kalmar on the mainland.' The stories from behind the cheery facade of the zoo, which welcomes visitors with a sign of two playing chimpanzees, has horrified and sickened the nation and animal lovers worldwide. Torture: When the mother of four lion cubs stopped feeding them, two of them starved to death before staff was allowed to bottle feed the other two . On Wednesday Pia Westen, 19, revealed . that the park had refused to let carers bottle feed a litter of lion . cubs ignored by their mother. Two of them starved to death before carers were allowed to feed the other two. Staff were ordered to hide the suffering lion cubs behind tarpaulin sheets, with Westen saying: '[Supervisors] didn’t want visitors seeing them lying there, dying. The animal caretakers really wanted to save them . but they weren't allowed until two of them had starved to death.’ Caroline Ryding worked at the park for . two months in 2011 and claims she quit her job after witnessing 'permanent maltreatment of the animals'. She said: 'A coati - a Brazilian aardvark - was . beaten to death with a baseball bat or a crowbar. And we were told . afterwards not to tell the zoo vet.' Clubbed to death: A Coati - a Brazilian aardvark - was allegedly beaten to death using a baseball bat or a crowbar . 'They had no room for them and couldn't afford a vet. The owners told us not to say anything because what they did was illegal.' Last year the company made a £1.2m . profit and the park’s director Barbro Hägg has been given an estimated £2.4m in salary and shares in the past five years. Zoo spokesman Hans Uhrus claimed the care was of high standard and that the zoo was regularly checked by vets and the County Administration Board. He said: 'We always take great care in dealing with . our animals. We have regular controls of our business under the animal . protection act through inspections. The board has received no complaints regarding the park.' Happy face: Meerkats are photographed playing in their pen at Oland's zoo, an image the directors are keen to portray to visitors . This claim was backed up by the park’s veterinarian Karl Johan Nordfelt. He said: 'As the park's veterinary surgeon I visit the park at least once a week to see the animals and how they are kept. 'The animals' well-being is checked every day by the staff on site and I control how they are kept during my regular visits. 'I have nothing to comment on regarding the care of the animals in the park.' The animal park, on the Baltic island . of Öland, off Sweden's east coast, is home to around 650 . animals of over 100 different species.","Swedish zoo clubbed animals to death in a bid to save on veterinary costs .

The grandfather of Ben Needham, who went missing 21 years ago on a Greek holiday island, joined a major search operation today. Eddie Needham has arrived at Kos to meet Greek and British police officers to trawl through land close to the farmhouse on the Greek island where Ben went missing in 1991. As he joined a 50-strong team of experts excavating a mound of earth he said he was overwhelmed by the support he had received. Mystery: Baby Ben, who was just 21 months old when he vanished in July 1991. Right, his mother Kerry . Eddie Needham (centre), grandfather of Ben, is flanked by British police officers during a search operation for the remains of the British toddler on the Greek island of Kos . Mr Needham (centre) said although he found it difficult to return to Kos, he was 'pleased' he had to help in the search . Ben, from Sheffield, vanished after he . travelled to the island with his mother and grandparents, Eddie and . Christine, who were renovating the building in the village of Iraklise. Local people have joined the operation, and Mr Needham said although he found it difficult to return to Kos, he was 'pleased' he had. In a statement issued by South Yorkshire Police, he said: 'I would like to thank the Greek authorities for their investigation and South Yorkshire Police for their support. 'I also can't believe the support we're getting from the local community. 'Can I please thank the local teachers, council workers, factory workers and everyone who is giving up their own time to volunteer to help. 'I have in the past found it hard to return to the island but today, seeing the efforts being made by everyone, especially the search team, and seeing the support from all the media, I was so pleased. 'Many thanks.' Despite a number of possible sightings . and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the . youngster has been found. The new police operation is focusing on a mound of earth and rubble close to where Ben was last seen. Mr Needham, told ITV Calendar News: 'It's a massive operation. Members of a Greek rescue team search for the remains of Ben Needham, who went missing near the home where his grandparents and mother were holidaying . A new search began on Friday to look for the toddler who some believe may have been accidentally buried beneath rubble that was dumped near the farmhouse where he was staying . Hunt: British police search of a field slowly and carefully with the help of sniffer dogs as the 10 day search gets underway this morning following an 18-month review of the case by South Yorkshire Police . Crime scene: Rescue workers in red overalls slowly search the grassy field near where Ben went missing . 'The least I can do is what the police . ask me to do and come and show them where we did initially search the . area and to point out where this mound was.' Mr Needham said he has been back to the location over the years. He said: 'It was a very traumatic experience but I'm sure this time it is for an absolute reason.' A JCB driver said he was dumping earth in . an overgrown field next door to the farmhouse on the afternoon that . 21-month-old Ben went missing. Yesterday, Kerry Needham, 41, told the Daily Mirror: 'If they find his bones my life is finished'. The search of a mound in the field in the village of Iraklise is involving up to 22 British experts, scientists and officers, as well as the . latest scanning technology – including instruments which detect bones. Twenty five Greek rescuers will also be assisting with the 10-day dig on the plot of land which has now become a crime scene. The . dig follows an 18-month review of the case by South Yorkshire Police. It is the first time in 21 years that the land has been properly . searched. Greek and British police officers inspect a field where a bulldozer is set to dig up the mound of earth . South Yorkshire Police detective superintendent Matt Fenwick who is leading the search addresses the media . Authorities on Kos have granted a permit for the excavation based on ‘reasonable suspicions’ by British police. The cost of the operation – certain . to be a substantial five figure sum – will be paid by British taxpayers. Ms Needham, who is on the . island awaiting developments, said yesterday that she does not . believe he was buried there. She dismisses claims he died by accident. She is supporting the excavation as . it will ‘eliminate speculation’ about an accidental death. She said she . was pleased it would be going ahead ‘and it’s going to be a thorough and . proper investigation’.

The cost of the operation – certain . to be a substantial five figure sum – will be paid by British taxpayers . Authorities on Kos have granted a permit for the excavation based on 'reasonable suspicions' by British police . She added: ‘Once they know that Ben . is not in the area where he went missing from, then a full worldwide . search is going to be done. 'When this search goes ahead it will prove that – and then everybody can concentrate on the real investigation.’ Police are confident the boy’s remains . will be found if he was buried there. Their search involves . expensive sonar ground-scanning equipment not available to the Greek . authorities, two sniffer dogs trained to look for human remains, and a forensic . archaeologist from a UK university.

Right is a picture of what he might look like today aged 23 . Holiday home: The house where the Needhams were staying at the time of Ben's disappearance . Theories: Police believed that Ben may have wandered into tangled undergrowth and ended up under rubble the builders were dumping there . Ben’s DNA profile was obtained from a . hospital blood test taken at birth and will be compared with any remains . that may be found. Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who is . leading the inquiry, said: ‘We want to clear the ground from where Ben . originally went missing to, if you like, finalise that as a line of . inquiry.’ Ben vanished in July 1991 when Miss . Needham, 19 at the time, left him with her parents Eddie and  Christine . while she worked at a local hotel. The boy’s grandparents had emigrated . to Kos and Mr Needham, a builder, was renovating the farmhouse next to . the ‘mound’ which is about to be searched by police. Ben wandered off at . around 2.30pm. Police were not contacted for at least . three hours because his grandparents thought he must have gone with . Kerry’s brother Stephen, then 17, who left the farmhouse on his moped . around the time Ben was last seen. Police found no clues to explain what had happened. Over the years there have been hundreds of reported sightings of Ben. Images showing what he would look like . as he grew up have been released. The latest was issued by the official . Ben Needham website and showed what he might have looked like in 2010 . aged 21. Kerry Needham has dismissed previous claims that Ben was buried under rubble and insists he is still alive . Never found: Ben, who slipped out of his grandparents' sight at a farmhouse, would be 23 this year . Nightmare: Grandparents Eddie (left) and Christine (right) were looking after Ben while Kerry was at work . Interest in the mound increased . earlier this year when the JCB driver Konstantinos Barkas, 61, told how . he had been excavating earth for a new property on the day Ben vanished. He said: ‘Loads of earth were being taken to clear the ground. I think people were misled in thinking the child was abducted. 'Could there have been an accident? The little boy was two years old and the thorns in that field were as high as my waist.’ His account increased speculation Ben may have been buried by accident or murdered and then buried.","Police are examining mound of rubble where toddler might have been accidentally buried on island of Kos in 1991 .

Gardeners and ‘allotment amateurs’ have been accused of fuelling a national potato shortage by spreading a devastating fungal blight. Farmers across the UK have suffered amid the wettest summer in 100 years, with waterlogged fields and many crops left to rot. The weather has made potatoes vulnerable to fungal infections that damage and stunt their growth. Commercial farmers across the UK have suffered amid the wettest summer in 100 years, with downpours that have left fields waterlogged. Here a farmer shows some freshly dug new potatoes . Farmers say the situation has been made worse by the army of ‘grow-your-own’ gardeners. The Potato Council says they are . responsible for spreading the blight because they can’t identify it . quickly and do not know how to control outbreaks. The so-called ‘late blight’ affecting . potato crops is caused by fungal spores that reproduce rapidly in warm . and moist conditions and are then spread on the wind. This sort of fungal blight – . phytophthora infestans – was responsible for the Irish Potato Famine and . the devastation of crops in the Highlands and much of Europe in the . 1800s. To blame? 'Grow your own' gardeners, like this woman on an allotment in Peckham, south London, have been accused of unwittingly helping to spread a disease affecting potatoes . The Duchess of Cambridge recently told a group of gardeners in Newcastle that she grew her own potatoes, but had suffered a poor crop this year . While farmers routinely douse crops in fungicides to kill off the spores, gardeners tend to avoid using such chemicals. The potato blight fungus was responsible for the Irish potato famine between 1845 and 1852. The famine, referred to as the Great Famine in Ireland, devastated the country, where one in three people depended on potatoes as their main, if not only, source of food. Many starved or died from related illness and the famine saw the population fall by at least a fifth due to the deaths and resulting emigration. As a result, even small garden or allotment plots of infected potatoes can threaten farms across a wide area. The Potato Council warned they were responsible for a ‘disproportionate amount of overall blight pressure’ in warm, wet seasons. Council chairman Allan Stevenson said it would be better if amateurs left the growing of potatoes to the professionals. He told The Grocer magazine: ‘People should be encouraged to grow their own vegetables to learn about the origins of their food. ‘But the blight risk is real, and it . would be preferable if people bought healthy, well-produced potatoes . from their retailer, rather than grow their own.’ The spores can survive through the . winter months on vegetation, in the soil and on any potato plants that . are not properly cleared at the end of the harvest. Farmers will routinely douse their crops in fungicides in order to kill off the spores but that has not helped this year . Tesco and Sainsbury’s have warned of shortages of UK-grown vegetables and higher prices in the run-up to Christmas. Stores have doubled the price of . popular varieties such as Maris Piper over the past year, while further . increases on all types of root vegetables are expected. Some retailers have even put up . warning notices saying that fresh produce was not up to the normal . ‘beauty pageant’ standard because of the rain. The Potato Council has contacted . amateur gardening organisations to produce a special blight fact-sheet . and other guidance and advice on growing potatoes. It has also recruited hundreds of . ‘blight monitors’ to check on the development of late blight both on . allotments and in commercial crops.","Commercial farmers have suffered wettest summer in 100 years .

"David Kirchhoff, 45, labelled himself a 'slow learner' after becoming familiar with the company's calorie-counting system in 2000 . By . Kristie Lau . PUBLISHED: . 15:16 EST, 9 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:40 EST, 9 May 2012 . Shedding unwanted weight is a struggle many are familiar with and that includes the head of Weight Watchers. David Kirchhoff, the 45-year-old president and chief executive officer of Weight Watchers, has written a book that reveals how he struggled to adapt to the company's famous calorie-counting points system. Although he first learned of the system when he joined the company in 2000, the New York-based CEO told the Today show this morning that he was a 'slow learner' when it came to shedding his own unwanted weight. Now and then: David Kirchhoff, the CEO of Weight Watchers, has revealed his own weight loss battle in a new book titled Weight Loss Boss. It took him a long nine years to shed 40lbs . The book, titled Weight Loss Boss, details how it took Mr Kirchhoff, who has served as CEO since 2006, almost a decade to shed 40lbs. The weight loss finally came as a result of adapting to healthy eating habits rather than focusing on quick-fix solutions such as dieting. It is an ethos that Weight Watchers promotes. He said of the extensive struggle: 'Honestly, I . think because I was in the dieting mentality, which is to be hard-core . for two or three months and then… go back to my old life.' Mr Kirchhoff, who has weighed 203lbs for the past three years, believes the real key to weight loss is to address an individual's 'underlying behaviour' that may work as a contributor to weight gain. Weight loss king: He went on this morning's Today show (above) to speak about the book, which aims to educate people about healthy eating habits and how to stick to them . He . said: 'Establish routines and habits, try to avoid temptation, try to . rely less on willpower. These are the things I've learned… lessons that I . wasn't following for the first nine years that have been saving my skin . for the last three.' Motivational: The book (above) reveals his own personal weight weight loss awakening . The book also reveals how he put on 45lbs in one year of attending college. A doctor's appointment in 1999 sparked initial health concerns but it was not enough to push him to shed the weight entirely. He wrote in the book: 'My first shock was stepping . onto my doctor's scale. Watching the nurse slide weight after weight to . the right before finally landing on 242lbs was a punch to my expanding . gut. How did this happen? 'As a tall guy, I could carry my baggage pretty well, and I'd almost convinced myself that I didn't weigh all that much.' He was offered a job at Weight Watchers at the end of 1999 and while  the role was less significant than the one he currently holds, the Weight Watchers work environment forced him to evaluate his unhealthy weight even further. He said: 'In taking the job, I thought it would be a nice perk to maybe lose that weight in the process. 'Nine years later - yes, that's right: nine years - I reached my goal weight.' He added that obesity is no longer just a women's issue. He said: 'Men suffer the same ill health effects that women do yet they're half as likely to do something about it.'","David Kirchhoff, 45, labelled himself a 'slow learner' after becoming familiar with the company's calorie-counting system in 2000 ."

Along with Captain Sig, stars driving the trend include David Beckham and Robbie Williams - both of whom have been spotted sporting cosy cable knit cardigans recently.

One Direction's Liam Payne is also a fan, recently having been snapped heading into the ITV Daybreak studio clad in his trusty grey cable knit. Sales figures released by Debenhams show that British men are particularly partial to a pair of chunky boots, which are up 81 per cent, duffle coats, striped t-shirts, thermal underwear and heavy knits. According to the retailer, Deadliest Catch and other fishing-focused TV shows such as Extreme Fishing with Robson Green, are the driving force behind the trend.'No longer just the hobby of a solitary riverbank dweller, these TV shows have made ‘fisherman fashion’ mainstream,' says Lizzie Singleton, spokesman for Debenhams. With designers such as . Acne's Jonny Johansson, Burberry's Christopher Bailey and Paul Smith all showing angling-inspired pieces too, the trend looks set to stay. 'The humble duffle coat, waterproof trousers and obligatory chunky socks [are] the must have look for autumn/winter 2012,' says Singleton, who adds that the coolest way to wear . fisherman . fashion is to work in bold colours toned down with neutral . boots and a classic navy beanie.

'time out' method of discipline, then you have not yet discovered Honest . Toddler. The sharp-tongued . tot, who will not reveal their identity, has earned a huge following on . Twitter thanks to musings on Mommy's Pinterest recipes, getting lost in . the Ikea kitchen department and potty training. Now, in an exclusive interview,  Honest Toddler reveals diet and fashion tips, as well as the secrets to success. Lifestyle tips: Honest Toddler has shared advice on diet, fashion and getting your own way . 'Know when to say ""no"",' HT tells MailOnline. 'If you're not sure say it anyway.' In . terms of style, HT has some sage advice: 'Don't be peer pressured into . wearing unnecessary items like hats or pants or shoes. Like Russell . Simmons says, ""Do you.""' A good fit is also essential, and skinny denim is a serious no-no. 'Never wear jeans so tight you can't . put several smooths rocks inside your pockets. The road to hipsterdom is . paved with bad decisions at Baby Gap,' HT warns. 'Don't be peer pressured into wearing unnecessary items like hats or pants or shoes. Like Russell Simmons says, ""Do you""' 'Stay . vigilant. Get naked. Also, if you weren't even conceived when a band . was playing don't wear their toddler-sized T-shirts because it makes you . a liar.' Diet is another . subject important to HT. Twitter informs us of a love of chocolate (no . matter where it may have been found) and cookies - especially if they . come from Grandma, however the scope is (slightly) broader, so take . heed, Mommy. '[I eat] refined carbohydrates (no brown rice) and milk. I enjoy bananas with the strings removed or burned off,' HT says. 'Exercise is . important to me which is why I try not to ever stop moving. Yesterday I . popped and locked in a grocery store check-out line for five full . minutes. A sign broke. It might be on YouTube I dunno.' Fashion faux pas: Honest Toddler warns . against skinny jeans (left), baby band tees (centre, 'it makes you a . liar') and being peer pressured into wearing unnecessary items like . shoes (right) 198 . Of course a degree of downtime is key, . and when one is absolutely forced to go to bed, stories do make the . process easier to handle. HT's current book of choice is If You Give a . Mouse A Cookie, apparently 'a story about greed and enabling rodents to . obesity'. Why one should be expected to sleep all night long is beyond HT though. 'I've . always been (in)famous in my family on account of me causing the most . problems at night due to repeated small requests. A trophy ceremony has . not been formally arranged but I can feel one on the horizon. Fingers . crossed. :)' Honest Toddler, which also exists as a blog and Facebook page with a 46,000-strong fan-base, is described as: 'Not potty trained. Not trying.' General mischief is a popular theme; a tweet yesterday read: 'Breaking glass sounds like applause. That can't be an accident.' Another, posted on Tuesday, said: 'Ripped up some paper money. You should see her face.' Regular readers of the posts have . become familiar with themes, such as Mommy's penchant for childrenswear . purchased on Etsy and recipes found on Pinterest. Neither, as one can imagine, have been well-received. 'Pinterest recipes should include instructions on how to break the news to your family,' HT writes. 'Pizza with cauliflower crust for . dinner Jesus take the wheel... Mommy's Pinterest abomination came out of . the oven smelling like lies.' Use of Twitter terminology such as retweets, hashtags and 'Follow Friday' is also used to great effect. 'RT if you're awake before five and hoping for pancakes,' reads one. Another . suggests: '#FF Daddy. You were born a tattle but I forgive you. See me . later about some chocolate I found. I think it's chocolate.' Even . current events come into play, such as the scandal surrounding the . publication of photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing . topless. 'Revealing photos of me are all over Facebook and Instagram so I know how Kate Middleton feels right now,' he comments. Last month it emerged that Honest Toddler had signed a book deal with Simon & Schuster in the U.S., HarperCollins Canada and Orion UK.

On trial: Radovan Karadzic appeared relaxed as he gave a 90-minute statement to defend himself against charges of genocide and war crimes . Former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic claimed at his genocide trial yesterday that he was a ‘mild’ and ‘tolerant’ man, who sought peace and reduced the ‘suffering of all civilians’. The statement met with cries of outrage from survivors of the Bosnian war packed into the public gallery at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Some wept at what they branded the ‘cruel, empty’ words of the man they blame for masterminding the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of Muslims in the 1990s. A relaxed-looking  Karadzic, 67, opened his defence by insisting he had done ‘everything within human power’ to avoid the war, adding: ‘Instead of being accused of the events in our war, I should be rewarded for all the good things I have done.’ Karadzic was arrested in Serbia in 2008 after 13 years living in disguise as a new age health guru. He denies blame for atrocities including the 1995 Srebrenica massacre when more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were executed. Karadzic told judges he was a reluctant player in the break-up of Yugoslavia, adding that before the war many of his friends were Muslims. Until his arrest in 2008, Karadzic . had been one of the most wanted men in the world, accused of . orchestrating the murders of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats . during a war that ultimately claimed the lives of an estimated 100,000 . people between 1992 and 1995. He is also being prosecuted for his role in the shelling and 44-month siege of Sarajevo which left 12,000 civilians dead and forced thousands to eat . grass to survive, and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in . May and June 1995. Scroll down for video . Speaking: The former Bosnian-Serb leader is attempting to sidestep allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity during the conflict, including the wholesale massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys from Srebrenica in July 1995 . The Butcher and the Beast: Radovan Karadzic, right, walks with Ratko Mladic, known as the 'Butcher of Bosnia' on Mount Vlasic frontline in Serbia in 1995. Mladic went on trial this year facing the same charges . As Supreme Commander of the . Bosnian Serb armed forces and President of the National Security Council . of the Republika Srpska, prosecutors have claimed Karadzic was ultimately responsible for numerous massacres and war crimes carried out by his army. Current charges include: . Karadzic was acquitted over the following massacres carried out by the Republika Srpska army after prosecutors failed to provide enough evidence to support claims that he was directly responsible. But the former psychologist and poet, . told judges he was a 'physician and literary man' who was a reluctant . player in the violent breakup of Yugoslavia. He said Muslims had faked the . circumstances of two shellings of a marketplace in the Bosnian capital . Sarajevo during a siege by Serb forces where more than 100 people were . killed. 'Sarajevo is my city, and any story that we would shell Sarajevo without . any reason is untrue,' he said, reiterating long-standing allegations . by the Serb side which have already been refuted by the Hague tribunal . in an earlier case. Karadzic said Sarajevo was his adopted home and that 'every shell that fell on Sarajevo hurt me personally.' Branding the first market shelling a 'shameless orchestration', he added: 'Obviously some people got killed by that explosion but we also saw mannequins being thrown onto trucks creating this show for the world.' Leaning forward in his chair, he emphasised points with jabs of his right hand and paused occasionally to adjust his rimless glasses. He said the first marketplace . shelling, in February 1994, in which 68 people were killed and 144 were . injured, had been orchestrated, as was a second a few days later. Prosecutors have painted a starkly . different picture of Karadzic during months of witness testimony, . portraying him as a political leader who masterminded Serb atrocities . throughout the war. Karadzic, 67, denied that portrait of him. The . statement was not made under oath, meaning Karadzic could not be . cross-examined by prosecutors but will later be permitted to . cross-examine witnesses himself. His speech coincided with a historic moment for the tribunal as one of the last of the tribunal's 161 indicted suspects to face justice as his trial gets under way in a neighbouring courtroom. Goran Hadzic, a former leader of . rebel Serbs in Croatia, was arrested last year in northern Serbia after . more than seven years on the run and pleaded not guilty to charges of . murdering hundreds of Croats and expelling tens of thousands more. But all eyes were on Karadzic today . as he tried to dodge claims that he masterminded some of the most . horrific wartime atrocities since the Second World War. Karadzic was arrested in 2008 on a bus in Belgrade after he had been on the run for almost 13 years. He . had been living in disguise as a new age health guru. The trained . psychiatrist worked for a private clinic, posing as a specialist in . alternative medicine under the assumed name of Dragan Dabic. Unrecognisable: Following his arrest in 2008, . pictures beamed around the world revealed not the flamboyant, . bouffant-haired leader of armies, right, but a bedraggled pensioner with . a bushy white beard down to his chest . Power: Karadzic inspects members of special forces from the Bosnian Serb Army lines up for review in eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik. He faces allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity during the conflict that left an estimated 100,000 people dead between 1992 and 1995 . The Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal began trying its last suspect today, opening the final chapter for an institution that has broken new ground in the investigation of conflicts and paved the way for a permanent global war crimes court. Goran Hadzic (pictured), the last of 161 suspects still alive and at large after the wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia, was arrested last year and is accused of murder, torture and forcible deportation at the very outset of those wars. Prosecutors say Hadzic, president of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina from 1992-94, was responsible for killings and forced deportations of minority ethnic Croats from the region after the Croatian government in Zagreb broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991. Already sentenced in his absence to a total of 40 years in prison by Croatian courts in the mid-1990s, Hadzic was finally detained by Serbian authorities in 2011. Pictures . beamed around the world revealed not the flamboyant, bouffant-haired . leader of armies but a bedraggled and washed-up pensioner with a bushy . white beard down to his chest. His trial began at the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in October the following year. But he boycotted the start of his . trial in October 2009 saying he had not been given enough time to . prepare. The first witness did not testify until April 2010 and . prosecutors rested their case on May 25 this year. Just . over a month later, judges acquitted Karadzic of one count of genocide, . saying prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to establish that a . campaign of murder and persecution early in the Bosnian War amounted to . genocide. Prosecutors have appealed the acquittal. Karadzic still faces 10 more charges, including one genocide count relating to the Srebrenica massacre. Karadzic . is one of a trio of architects of the Balkan wars brought to trial in . The Hague for wars among the successor countries and the peoples of . multi-ethnic Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1999, in which well over . 100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced. His . wartime military chief, General Ratko Mladic, went on trial this year, . facing the same charges, and former Yugoslav and Serbian president . Slobodan Milosevic died in 2006 before the end of his trial. For years it seemed . that the main suspects would stay out of the tribunal's reach, until . political changes in the countries of southeastern Europe made it ever . more difficult for suspects to hide. In July, Serbia announced it was . investigating 13 people on suspicion of helping war criminals evade . justice. Grief: A Bosnian Muslim woman weeps as she squats next to the grave of her relative in the foggy morning during a memorial ceremony for victims of the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 . Grim task: International forensic experts examine dozens of bodies in a mass grave linked to the Srebrenica massacre that left 8,000 Muslim men and boys dead in a U.N.-protected enclave . Both men face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. After being cleared of the first genocide charge in June, he now faces the second relating to the deaths of more than 7,000 Bosniak (Bosnian . Muslim) men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995. It was the worst atrocity in . Europe since the end of World War II. He is also being prosecuted over the 44-month siege of Sarajevo, in which more than 12,000 civilians died. The trial continues. Humble beginnings: Radovan Karadzic was born in a stable in Savnik, Montenegro in 1945 . Poet, psychologist and relentless Serb patriot, Radovan Karadzic was born in a stable in Savnik, Montenegro in 1945. His father, Vuk, was in jail during much of his childhood. Vuk . had been a member of the Chetniks, the Serb nationalist guerillas who . fought for the Allies against both Nazi occupiers and communist . partisans in the Second World War. Karadzic's mother Jovanka has described her son as loyal, serious and . a hard worker, who used to help her in the home and in the field. He was respectful towards the elderly and helped his school friends with their homework. In 1960, Karadzic moved to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, where he . graduated as a doctor and became a psychologist in a city hospital. It . was in Sarajevo that Karadzic met his wife, Ljiljana. But he also . became a poet and fell under the influence of the Serb nationalist . writer Dobrica Cosic, who encouraged him to go into politics. Karadzic, . who was also an enthusiastic player of a single-string Serbian . instrument known as the 'gusle', became head of the Bosnian Serb . Democratic Party in 1989. The flamboyant, bouffant-haired leader showed few signs of the hatred . to come. He regularly played high-stakes poker with his Muslim and . Croat neighbours. But amid the chaos and violence of Yugoslavia's . disintegration, his assertion of 'historic Serbian rights' allegedly led to . appalling slaughter.","The former Bosnian-Serb leader began his defence against allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 Bosnian war .

Moira Gleed has a painful eye condition which causes her eyes to close against her will. She used to spend her entire day in darkness until she realised bursting into song could relieve her of the condition . Mrs Gleed said: 'My eyes used to get incredibly red and inflamed and were always itchy and sore.'Then I began to realise that my eye lids would just involuntary close. There was no way I could move them - apart from prising them open with my fingers. 'It was awful. I had to give up my job as a careers advisor, I couldn’t drive. I felt really lost. But then one day at my local choir practice, I was singing my heart out and all of a sudden I realised I could see the conductor. My eyes were open! Focal dystonia is a neurological condition which affects the muscles around the eyes, causing muscle spasms that make them close, twitch and blink. Mrs Gleed now walks with the aid of a stick and wears dark glasses and a visor. She said: 'It all started off with extreme light sensitivity. I didn’t question it at first but then my eyes started to get really sore and dry. 'I went to an optician and they thought I had inflammation of the eyes, but any medication I was given just made no difference. Mrs Gleed suffers from focal dystonia, a rare muscle complaint which causes her eye lids to spasm shut. The only way she can see is by prising them open - or singing . 'It was hard because I’d explain to my doctor what was happening but he had no idea what it was. I had so many referrals and appointments. 'Except for when I’m singing I almost feel like I’ve got sand in my eyes every minute of the day. They’re gritty and dry all the time. 'They don’t open properly but they don’t close properly either so that adds to pain.' Various over-the-counter remedies have failed to work. Mrs Gleed also has Botox injections every 10 weeks to relax the muscles around her eyes, but the success is variable. Thanks to her remarkable discovery, Mrs Gleed says she has a new lease of life. 'Singing just lets me forget about my problems and recharge my batteries for a bit,' she said. 'I suppose it is quite unusual. As soon as we stop singing and there’s the piano accompaniment or the introduction of the song my eyes are closed. And then as soon as I start singing, they open again. It's thought that activities such as singing can act as a distraction, causing the symptoms of dystonia to disappear temporarily . 'There seems to be something to do with music that forms a connection with me. I feel an incredible bond to it. I even find myself singing all the time now just to get a bit of relief.' Focal dystonia is just one type of the condition which affects at least 70,000 children and adults in the UK. Paul King, chief executive of the Dystonia Society said: 'Dystonia is a neurological condition where incorrect messages from the brain cause muscles to become over-active. 'It can affect many different parts of the body - and causes disabling and often painful postures or movements. 'For reasons that are not fully understood, shifts in attention can sometimes cause the symptoms to disappear temporarily. This can lead to people affected by dystonia finding relief in unexpected ways. 'Other examples we’ve been told about include being able to shout at the dog but not talk properly, being able to dance fine but not put the foot down flat normally, and being able to run for the washing when it’s raining, but find it extremely painful to walk. 'Unfortunately, the symptoms tend to reappear as soon as the activity causing the distraction finishes.' Moira now hopes to set up a support group in North Wales to help others affected by the condition. Thanks to her new found love of singing, Moira has even got her family and friends to get involved in belting out a song or two. 'My family are so proud of me and they see how happy singing makes me. I even managed to get my husband, Mike, to join the choir. 'The other day my grandson wanted to see my eyes. So I sang a little song and they popped open. It’s marvellous!

Hopes of an early jail release for the Pussy Riot punk protesters dimmed last night after Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a scathing attack on the three women singers. The trio are to appeal their two years prison sentences for staging a cathedral stunt opposing the strongman leader. Supporters of the women - who have called for a revolution against Putin - fear his hardline stance will sway judges and rule out their punishments being reduced. Members of the all-girl punk band Pussy Riot are to appeal their prison sentences . 'First they went to the Yelokhovsky Cathedral and conducted an orgy there and then they went to the other cathedral and had another orgy,' he said in a major TV interview. 'The state is obliged to protect the feelings of the faithful.' The women were found guilty of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' for dancing and singing in Christ the Saviour Cathedral. He also chided the police for taking no action when one of the three - Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22 - was involved in a sexually explicit protest four years ago in a biological museum. President Vladimir Putin criticised police for not taking action when Nadeshda Tolokonnikova, a member of Pussy Riot, was involved in a protest four years ago . 'They had a group sex session in a public place. They then uploaded it onto the Internet. The authorities should have looked at this too,' he stressed. Recalled a Soviet-era joke, he said: 'Some fans say that group sex is better than one-on-one because - like in any collective work - you can take it easy a bit.' But he stressed: 'Uploading it onto the Internet is controversial and can be subject to legal proceedings.' Putin asked his interviewer if he knew what the band's name meant. 'There is no need to pretend that you don't know. It's indecent,' he said. He claimed the repression suffered by the church in Soviet times meant it had to be respected now. But he denied behind the scenes pressure to send the women to jail, despite suspicions of this among the opposition and in the West. 'I know what is going on with Pussy Riot, but I am staying out of it completely', he said. Supporters of Pussy Riot fear that Vladimir Putin's hardline stance will sway judges . Putin also denied he was clamping down on protest, declaring: 'What is ""tightening the screws""? If this means the demand that everyone, including representatives of the opposition, obey the law, then yes, this demand will be consistently implemented.' Putin also blasted Britain for 'double standards' in the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, alleging political interference in the attempt to extradite him to Sweden for sexual offences. Assange is holed up in the Ecuador embassy and has been granted political asylum by the South American country. 'They decided to extradite him. What is this? Of course it is double standards, that is clear,' he told Russia Today television. 'As far as I know, Ecuador asked Sweden for guarantees that Assange will not be extradited from Sweden to the United States. It has received no such guarantees. 'Of course this leads one to think that this is a political case.' The decision made a mockery of Britain's claim of judicial independence, he said.","The feminist band are set to appeal their two year prison sentences but supporters fear Putin's hardline stance will stop their punishments being reduced .

The Russian banker shot six times near Canary Wharf in March is back on his feet again – and vowing to defy his enemies by continuing to live and work in London. This exclusive photograph shows German Gorbuntsov, 46, who was gunned down in an apparent contract hit, learning to walk again in a privately funded room at an NHS hospital. He revealed that he faces major new surgery this week on his wounds – but hopes to be discharged in about a month. Yet his determination to remain in Britain could potentially run up a huge bill for the taxpayer in police protection. ‘They wanted me dead but now I’m walking,’  he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I can now manage about a third of a mile if I stay on the same level, and even climb 20 steps.’ A wound in his abdomen, where he was sprayed with bullets, will be treated during the latest operation. He attributed his progress to the care of ‘the best medics in the world’ in an NHS hospital that cannot be identified. The millionaire was treated without charge by the NHS for three months before moving into a private room at the same hospital under the care of the same doctors. Mr Gorbuntsov is guarded round the clock by a Metropolitan Police team who will remain with him for the duration of the investigation. ‘I’ve already changed where I will live and organised a new office, so I will be simply doing the same as before at a different location,’ he said. Recalling the shooting, he added: ‘The bullets started hitting my body and it was very painful.  I should have avoided moving to that location. 'It’s so quiet at night – now I will live in an area where it will be much more difficult to do the same.’ Mr Gorbuntsov’s asylum application, along with those of his wife Larisa, 46, and son Vladislav, 26, is pending. So are applications from Russian Natasha Semchenkova, 36, with whom he was living when he was shot, and their baby son. Safety: The 46-year-old is claiming political asylum in Britain for himself and his family, something which, if granted, could mean huge bills for the British taxpayer in police protection .",German Gorbuntsov was shot outside his flat in the Isle of Dogs in March .

It's 8am on a brisk Wednesday morning, and 100 nimble-footed participants have gathered in central London to take part in a giant 'flashmob' - a sudden choreographed dance routine set to music, aimed at surprising passers-by - and we're all getting dressed up as enormous breasts. The event has been organised by breast cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel!, the organisation founded by 26-year-old identical twins Kris and Maren Hallenga, whose lives were turned upside down in 2009. Kris and Maren Hallenga, centre front right and left, stand either side of choreographer Zoe Jackson, founder of Living The Dream, to lead the CoppaFeel! flashmob troupe in St Christopher's Place . That year, when the girls were just 23, Kris was diagnosed with breast cancer - a horrifying eight months after first going to her GP with concerns about lumps she was finding in her painful chest. Dismissed as 'hormones' and told she was far too young to have the disease, the cancer went undiagnosed for so long that it spread to her spine, only finally diagnosed when the twins' no-nonsense mother marched Kris to the doctor and demanded to be taken seriously. Kris now has stage four cancer, explaining that 'you can't go back a stage, and there is no stage five.' Despite all this, Kris is 'living with cancer' and doing OK. She still has treatment, but so far it's all going well. (What's more, her work has not gone unnoticed. She carried the Olympic torch through Tower Hamlets on 21 July, she's been given a Pride of Britain award, she's attended a Downing Street reception and was shortlisted for the Women of the Future Awards in 2011.) Zoe Jackson, centre front, choreographer and founder of Living The Dream, leads the CoppaFeel! flashmob in London's West End this morning . And on this crisp October morning . just off Oxford Street, she and her sister are virtually indistinguishable: two gorgeous leggy blondes who . both look the picture of glowing health. (In fact, the only way many of us are able to tell them apart is by Kris's jazzy leggings.) But both Kris and Maren are insistent that no . more young women get such a rude awakening as theirs, and so here we are, on St . Christopher's Place, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, determined to bring attention to CoppaFeel!, with . inflatable breasts strapped to our fronts. Kris, left, and Maren Hallenga, right, and their enormous breasts receive some admiring glances on St Christopher's Place . All 100 participants (me included) have . been given an online link to a video of the routine which was put . together by choreographer extraordinaire - and friend of the Hallengas Zoe . Jackson - founder of Living The Dream performing arts company, and winner of 2011 Women of the Future Award in the arts category. So we've all had time to practice and there is no excuse for putting a foot wrong. (That said, any neighbours who witnessed me clod-hopping around my sitting room at 5am this morning to James Brown's I Feel Good and Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out by Freak Power  would probably attest to the fact that I still needed much, much, much more practice.) Zoe Jackson and her giant inflatable breast, centre, lead the others through the routine to the delight of passers-by . After a quick run-through, we're ready to go, positioned around the various mews entrances onto St Christopher's Place, which is itself marking Breast Cancer Awareness Month by getting 'pink'd', adorning the streets with pink bunting and running a number of themed events. Kris, left, and Maren Hallenga, identical twins and founders of CoppaFeel! By now it's just before 9am, and the rush hour crowd is making its way to work, pausing to see what in the name of inflatable breasts is going on. The camera phones are coming out. We can hear the giggles over our nervous heartbeats. The music kicks in and the first gang of bouncing breasts run out, high-kicking, clapping, twisting, turning, rolling, jumping, leaping, grinning and, on occasion, whooping. Right on cue (My Humps by the Black-Eyed Peas; are you sensing a theme to the aural selections yet?), the second batch of breasts make a beeline for the front, pointing at their inflatable friends when Fergie hollers 'check it out!'. 'Checking it out' is, after all, the point of our flashmob and the modus operandi of CoppaFeel!. Kris didn't check her breasts until it was too late. Now she and Maren want us all - both women and men, for the disease can attack men, too - to cop a feel of ours. 'The charity is particularly about getting young people to check their boobs,' Kris, told MailOnline. 'I thought I was too young to get breast cancer and that it would never happen to me. I was wrong. Young people need to become familiar with their breasts so they can sense when something changes.' But there's no time for breast-checking just now in St Christopher's Place: right now it's time for me and my fellow breasts to bolt out of our starting blocks and into the melee. Three dancers run out to join the CoppaFeel! flashmob . It all comes together and looks amazing - at least from where I'm standing at the back of this sea of breasts. 'We like doing fun things like this,' said Kris, who prefers the term Boob Chief to CEO when it comes to her charity. 'The whole point of Coppafeel! is that . we go about awareness in different and engaging ways. We like causing a bit of a stir. 'We use these inflatable boobs stuffed with balloons for publicity events. The last thing we did was the BoobTube where 50 people from AOL wore them on the underground during rush hour. And people use them to run half marathons. 'We have a big cinema advert coming out soon which is terrific because the more people who are aware of us and aware of the importance of checking your boobs the better. 'The giant inflatable boobs really cause an impact which is why we like them. We have them made in different shades by a man in China - It's funny because I don't know if he has any idea what we use them for!'

'However you go about it, there is no right or wrong way to check your boobs, you just need to do it regularly. 'Get familiar with your breasts so you can spot any changes in them. 'Don't do it during your period because lots of women get lumpy boobs during that time, so wait until it settles down. 'It's not just lumps you're looking for. I had shooting pains in my armpit and a friend of mine who was diagnosed had incredibly painful breasts. 'But you're also looking for rashes on the breast, areas of thickening, nipple inversions or changes in size and shape, and discharge. 'Changes in the texture of your breast are important to look for, any sort of puckering of the skin. 'And make sure you look all the way up to your armpits and collarbone - lots of people think breast cancer doesn't go that far, but it does. 'And the sooner you catch it the better.'

Concern: Claire Perry Conservative MP has described the internet as a 'Wild West' Tens of thousands have joined the crusade to protect children by imposing an automatic block on online pornography. A petition containing more than 110,000 names will be handed in to Downing Street next week, putting huge pressure on David Cameron to take tough action to make the internet a safer place. More than 140 MPs from all parties have joined parents, teachers and church leaders to sign the petition, organised by the Safetynet campaign. It represents an unprecedented groundswell of opinion in favour of stricter controls. Last night campaigning MP Claire Perry delivered a ‘call to arms’ to parents, urging even more of them to sign the petition and respond to the government consultation to ensure their voice is heard. Under the scheme preferred by Safetynet, and backed by the Daily Mail, over-18s would only be able to access adult material if they specifically ‘opt in’ and go through an age check. A wide range of children’s charities, including the NSPCC and ChildLine, are demanding an ‘opt-in’ system. Last week ChildLine published disturbing statistics showing that the number of children calling the helpline after having encountered hardcore porn on the internet had soared by a third in just one year. The petition will be handed in next Thursday, to mark the end of a government consultation into whether parental controls should be strengthened. Campaigners, led by Tory MP Mrs Perry, will also hand in a letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is in charge of internet policy. It will highlight some alarming facts, including that one-in-three ten-year-olds have stumbled on pornography online, and that the largest group of internet pornography consumers are aged 12 to 17. Opt in: More and more people are signing the petition for stricter online controls for porn . Safetynet is a partnership between Premier Christian Radio and pressure group Safermedia. Peter Kerridge, chief executive of Premier Christian Radio, said the petition demonstrated the clear and growing resolve among people from all sections of society to ensure that internet service providers are required to block hardcore contact, including violent and abusive images. Pippa Smith, founder and chairman of Safermedia, said: ‘This petition is all about children – the most precious resource of any country. Back the campaign . ‘Overwhelming research shows that the internet is exposing millions of our children to the most hardcore pornography and on a scale never before seen. ‘It is totally within the power of the Government and ISPs to provide the best protection, which a universally adopted opt-in network-level filter would give. Our children deserve the best and the opt-in is the best protection.’ Mrs Perry, who earlier this year led a cross-party inquiry into the effect of online porn, said: ‘The internet is a Wild West where there are no built-in barriers to stop even the youngest children stumbling across or seeking out porn websites, as well as pro-anorexia, suicide or self-harm material.’ In a message to parents, she said: ‘If you can do one more thing this weekend in the hurly burly of back to school preparations, I would urge you to log on to the Department for Education website, download the consultation document and make your voice heard too. Or go to the Safermedia website and add your name to the petition.’ The consultation, on the Department for Education website, ends on Thursday. It can be reached on www.education.gov.uk. The petition can still be signed at www.safetynet.org.uk.","Pressure on PM David Cameron to act on concerns .

Pledge: David Cameron has pledged to end the heartache of tens of thousands of elderly people who are forced to sell their homes to fund long-term care . David Cameron has pledged to end the heartache of tens of thousands of elderly people who are forced to sell their homes to fund long-term care. He has told Nick Clegg and senior Tories that he will implement recommendations that cap the amount individuals pay at £35,000 – with the taxpayer picking up any further bills. Senior Coalition sources say the Prime Minister will find the £1.7billion annual costs of the plan in the next public spending review. Last month Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced that the Dilnot proposals were being put on ice after the Treasury said they were unaffordable. But the Mail has learned from senior Tories and Liberal Democrats that Mr Cameron has had a dramatic change of heart and is determined to press ahead with the plans. The Prime Minister and Mr Clegg both want to announce this autumn that they will implement the Dilnot recommendations in order to put the Coalition back on track. They plan to insert the pledge to enforce the proposals in 2017 into the Government’s Care and Support Bill. They see it as a key legacy project for the Government that will show the two parties working together to solve a major problem that affects millions. At the moment anyone with assets over £23,250 has to bear the cost of their own care. Last year more than 24,500 people had to sell their homes to pay the bills – a rise of 20 per cent in a decade. Under the proposals drawn up by economist Andrew Dilnot, the cap would be set at £35,000, after which the Government would pick up the tab. The initial £35,000 could be funded by an insurance policy taken out by people while they are still working. He also recommended that the £23,250 means test threshold should go up to £100,000. It is understood the Coalition will also honour this proposal. The Mail has learned that Mr Cameron decided to implement the Dilnot report a week after Mr Lansley put it on the back burner. Tough: At the moment anyone with assets over £23,250 has to bear the cost of their own care, which leads to many distressed pensioners selling their homes (file picture) He informed Mr Clegg of his decision and . then told senior Tories, including the Health Secretary, before . revealing his decision to the rest of the Cabinet at a meeting before . the summer break. Since then intensive discussions have . been going on behind the scenes between Downing Street, the Department . of Health and the Treasury. A senior Conservative source said: ‘The Prime Minister told the Cabinet before the recess. He said “We’ve got to do Dilnot. We’re going to do this”.’ A senior Lib Dem source added: ‘It’s definitely on. Cameron came to us and said… “Will you back me?” and we were thinking “that’s what we’ve been pushing for months and months”.’ Mr Clegg hinted at the change of heart last week when he said: ‘I personally have also felt we should go further and faster to deliver a properly funded system of social care for the elderly.’ Changes: Cameron has told Nick Clegg and senior Tories that he will implement recommendations that cap the amount individuals pay at £35,000 - with the taxpayer picking up any further bills . In addition to the Dilnot proposals, which primarily benefit pensioners with large homes, Lib Dems are also trying to win Tory support for moves to do more to help the poorest pensioners who have few assets. A Whitehall source added: ‘They’ve come to the conclusion they’d be mad not to do it. It’s all about the legacy. ‘It means both the Conservatives and Lib Dems can turn round in 2015 and say – we sorted out social care. No one will have to lose their homes to pay for nursing home care any more. ‘That’s a pretty big achievement – . and would appeal to both sets of voters.’ Ministers have considered . raising the £35,000 threshold in order to reduce the costs of the Dilnot . plan. But officials . say that the Coalition is minded to implement the proposals in full . since they command the support of charities and other care pressure . groups. Such a move would also make it more difficult for Labour to object, since they have also called for a deal. By . delaying the implementation of the plans until 2017, the Chancellor . will not have to find the extra cash until the spending review in 2014. ‘The . debate is not about the size of the cap, it’s about when you bring it . in,’ one source with knowledge of the discussions said. The Treasury is expected to argue that the plan should be paid for out of the general NHS budget. But that could create problems for Mr Cameron because Labour could argue that funding care was robbing hospitals and frontline services of cash. ‘The idea is to announce that the money will be found,’ one Whitehall official said. Heartbreaking: Last year more than 24,500 people had to sell their homes to pay the bills - a rise of 20 per cent in a decade . ‘If the Prime Minister says we’ll find the money then George will have to find the money.’ A Downing Street spokesman denied a date had been set for an announcement but confirmed Mr Cameron wanted to act and that serious discussions were under way. He said: ‘We are keen to get social care right for the long-term. It is not in the long grass.’","Cameron has told Nick Clegg that he will implement recommendations that cap the amount individuals .

Labour got it wrong: Ed Miliband admits today that his party became disconnected from the concerns of working people about immigration during their 13 years in power . Ed Miliband today promised new measures to prevent British people being 'locked out' of jobs by foreign workers, including forcing firms to declare if they employ high numbers of immigrants. Overseas-only employment agencies would be banned and an early-warning system set up to highlight areas where locals are 'dominated' by an influx of overseas labour under the proposals. While there cannot be set quotas on home-grown workers, urgent action is required to identify where British jobseekers need better training to compete, the Labour leader said. In a major U-turn, Mr Miliband said the party became 'disconnected from the concerns . of working people' during its 13 years in power. Labour often tried to silence criticism of its immigration policy by suggesting it was inspired by racism while in office. The announcement represents a . major change of direction for the party after Gordon Brown branded voter . Gillian Duffy a 'bigoted woman' for raising concerns about the impact of immigration during the 2010 election campaign. Mr Brown was forced to apologise to Mrs Duffy, 65, after he met her to smooth over her anger after insulting her. It was one of the key moments in the election campaign and was see to signify how out of touch Labour had become on immigration. As . he got into his car, Brown was still wired to a Sky News microphone and . was overheard telling an aide: 'That was a disaster.. They should never . have put me with that woman. Whose idea was that? Ridiculous.' Asked what was wrong, Brown responded: 'Everything, she was just a bigoted woman.' Mr Miliband said Labour made a mistake by allowing . uncontrolled migration into Britain in 2004 when Poland and other . eastern European states joined the EU. He said demanding that job centres be . told of all firms where more than one in four staff is from overseas . would form part of the new system to provide Whitehall and town halls . with vital information. Mr Miliband hopes to shift the focus . of the debate from border controls, and what he says are ineffective . Government caps on arrivals, towards the impact on people’s daily lives. While restrictions on new arrivals, . including caps on people from any new EU member state, are necessary, . reforming the jobs market is just as important, he argued. Stricter enforcement of minimum wage . laws and doubling fines to £10,000 would also form part of an effort to . stop firms using cheap foreign labour to undercut domestic jobseekers. Scroll down for video... Flashpoint: Gordon Brown was caught calling Gillian Duffy (right) a 'bigoted woman' after she raised the issue of migrant workers with him on the campaign trail . Mr Miliband distanced himself from . the rhetoric of his predecessor Gordon Brown, saying: 'I am not going to . promise ""British jobs for British workers"". 'But we need an economy which offers . working people a fair crack of the whip. The problem we need to address . is in those areas and sectors where local talent is locked out of . opportunity.' He said Labour had to change its approach to immigration and recognise 'the costs as well as the benefits'. The last Labour government under Mr Brown became 'too disconnected from the concerns of working people', he said. 'We too easily assumed those who . worried about immigration were stuck in the past, unrealistic about how . things could be different, even prejudiced,' he said. 'But Britain was experiencing the largest peacetime migration in recent history, and people’s concerns were genuine. 'Why didn’t we listen more? At least . by the end of our time in office, we were too dazzled by globalisation . and too sanguine about its price. Polish only: Workers after being dropped off at the Bernard Matthew's factory in Great Witchingham, Norfolk . One of Asda's biggest meat suppliers caused controversy when it was caught advertising for Polish-speaking staff only. Forza AW sent the advert to hundreds of job hunters on the books of a Norfolk-based employment agency. One was told: 'You have to be fluent because the health and safety training is done in Polish.' The ban on British applicants, which is illegal under the Race Relations Act, happened in 2010. Forza chief executive Max Hilliard said at the time the advert went out as a result of a 'breakdown in communications'. Job hunters in the area yesterday complained they often lose out to foreigners. Sarah Davies, 32, from Norwich, who lost her cleaning job four months ago, said: 'There are a lot of foreign workers and you are competing against them for even the most basic jobs. 'It means people like me are being left on the scrapheap. I don't want to be a burden on the taxpayer.' Does Ed Miliband's immigrant family past make him best placed to understand the issue? 'By focusing too much on . globalisation and migration’s impact on growth, we lost sight of who was . benefiting from that growth - and the people who were being squeezed. And, to those who lost out, Labour was too quick to say ‘Like it or lump . it’.' Mr Miliband said the numbers of low-skilled immigrants coming to the UK 'are probably still too high and I would like to do something about it'. But many of those arrivals were from the EU and so the answer had to lie in reducing the demand for cheap labour rather than any 'blanket promise about numbers'. That problem, he added, was being worsened by the Government's proposals - on the back of the Beecroft review - to relax employment laws. 'Of course overall numbers matter but it does also depend on who is coming in and what impact they are having,' he said when he took questions after the speech. 'On the question of low-skilled migration, I think numbers are probably still too high and I would like to do something about it. 'But most of that is from within the EU - because we have tightened up the other routes - and therefore the question on this is how to you change the way your economy works so that employers do not resort to that as their response.' A Tory spokesman said Labour continued to lack 'credibility' on immigration. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the . MigrationWatch think-tank, last night welcomed the change of heart, but . said it needed to be followed by a change of strategy. He said: 'Mumbled apologies are not . enough. Having caused the mass immigration of recent years, will Labour . now pledge to cut back future immigration, and if so how?' Mr Miliband suggested that Labour under Tony Blair became 'dazzled by globalisation and too sanguine about its price'. He said the impact of immigration has . had a class divide, with the well-off benefiting from cheap labour, . while others find their own jobs and incomes are undercut. The Labour leader will also outline a string of changes to the party's approach to immigration. He will acknowledge the party made 'a mistake' in not putting controls on the number of migrants who flocked here from Poland and other Eastern European countries after they joined the EU. Countries joining in future, such as Croatia and Turkey, should face curbs.","Labour 'disconnected from concerns of working people' during 13 years in power, says Ed Miliband .

The Eastridges say that fateful day, October 29, 2010, changed their lives forever and as they grieve for the son they never knew - they have a new found joy with the arrival of a baby girl this year. Injured: Matt and Meredith Eastridge (pictured in 2010) suffered severe injuries and spent nearly 60 days in the hospital after the tragic car crash . Our Angel: The Eastridges lost their unborn son, Elijah Dean, in the crash on October 29 . Meredith Eastridge was six months pregnant when she and her husband drove to pick up their other vehicle, that had been towed, from an impound lot around 12:30am on a Thursday in October 2010. The pair saw a speeding Volvo coming towards them and in a flash, everything in their life would change. The driver, David Canter Huffman, was going 100 mph when he crossed the center line and hit the Eastridges head-on in their Toyota RAV4. The impact flipped their SUV and it was knocked back 25 feet. The driver: David Canter Huffman had a blood-alcohol content of nearly three times the legal limit on Oct. 29, 2010. The 25-year-old died in the crash . Huffman had a blood-alcohol content of nearly three times the legal limit at the time of the collision. The 25-year-old driver died in the crash. Both Matt and Meredith were severely injured and they lost their son. The couple, who married in April . 2009, were hospitalized for several months. They underwent several . surgeries and had to relearn how to complete basic tasks. '10/28/10 . changed my life forever, life is simply too short to never really . live,' Matt Eastridge, who runs an online marketing company in . Charlotte, wrote on his Facebook profile. 'Carpe Diem my friends, for tomorrow is far short of a guarantee,' he added. But in the aftermath of the tragedy, . details emerged about Huffman's movements before he landed behind the . wheel of his car and the couple brought a case against the bar where he . had been before he went out on the road.

Moving forward: The couple (pictured drinking sparkling grape juice for New Year's 2011) underwent multiple surgeries and had to relearn how to complete basic tasks . Before . the crash, Huffman had stopped by Eddie’s Place Restaurant and Bar, in . south Charlotte, to unwind at the end of the day and surveillance video . shows the man downing shots with the bar's owner, according to The Charlotte Observer. He . had been served at least eight drinks, according to the restaurant, but . an attorney for the Eastridges estimate it was closer to 15 drinks. Huffman was clearly drunk and even walked into a chair as he tried to move about, footage showed. An . attorney for the restaurant, Rick Pinto, said the restaurant's . employees had arranged for Huffman to catch a ride with someone but in . his altered mental state, he went to his own car instead.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:28 EST, 5 October 2012 . A Portuguese male model accused of brutally murdering his older lover during a fight castrated the victim and then wore his testicles on his wrists to harness their power, the defendant's lawyer told the jury Friday. According to attorney Rubin Sinins, Renato Seabra murdered noted Portuguese fashion journalist Carlos Castro, 65, during an hour-long psychotic fit that took place at the InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan last year. After hitting the older man with a computer monitor and stomping on his head, Sinins said his client cut off his testicles using a corkscrew and slit his own wrists. Accused: Renato Seabra, a former Portuguese model, is charged with murdering a Portuguese journalist in a Times Square hotel room in 2011 . Insanity defense: Seabra's attorney claims the 21-year-old man snapped and killed Castro in a psychotic fit during which he castrated the older man with a corkscrew and wore his testicles on his own wrists . 'He put one [testicle] on each wrist,' Sinins told the court. 'He did this for his protection. He could also harness the power. He wandered the streets of Manhattan, touching people, because he had the power to cure people from AIDS, because he had the power to cure them.' The lawyer went on, telling the jury that Seabra explained to police the day after the murder that ‘he believed Mr. Castro's testicles were demons, and that by pulling them out everything would be right with the world,’ the New York Post reported. Slain: Carlos Castro, 65, a well-known Portuguese fashion writer and gay rights activist, was bludgeoned to death and mutilated . Seabra's attorney revealed the sensational details of the murder during his opening statment in an attempt to bolster the 21-year-old’s insanity defense, which hinges on a claim that the male model suddenly snapped. 'He willingly told police. He wanted to explain why he killed Mr. Castro, because he thought what he had done was right, Sinins said. The lawyer asked the jury to acquit Seabra by reason of insanity, with the possibility of being committed to a psychiatric facility, according to the New York Daily News. ‘He was in another world,’ Sinins told jurors. ‘He was deluded into thinking that he was a special messenger from God, on a mission to make the world a better place.’ However, the prosecution implored the panel not to believe the psychotic episode story, insisting that there was nothing in the 21-year-old’ medical history to suggest even a hint of mental illness. District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal described Seabra as a hot-headed gold-digger who realized that his free ride was over and killed Castro out of anger, not insanity. Castro met the ambitious male model in Portugal in May of 2011 and the two started seeing each other. In January, the 65-year-old TV journalist and gay activist flew Seabra to New York, where the younger man was hoping to find modelling work through a Manhattan agency. 'He want[ed] to be famous and make money. He also wanted nice things — clothes, electronics, gifts for his family. He wanted to eat in nice restaurants. When Carlos Castro showed up in Renato Seabra's life, he saw a means to an end and he got on board.' But the relationship between the two began turning sour when Castro caught Seabra going out with a group of young women. On . January 7, tensions came to a head when Seabra and Castro got into a . fight over the older man's plans to send his lover home, thus signalling . the end of their whirlwind romance. Luxury: Castro and Seabra had a huge fight while staying at the high-end InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan which ended in Castro's brutal death . Seabra picked up a computer monitor and bashed Castro over the head before stomping on his face and strangling him until the older man was dead. ‘This anger came from the end of a relationship with Carlos Castro,’ Rosenthal said. ‘He knew he was beating, stomping and mutilating Carlos Castro. And he knew it was wrong.’ Court papers presented by prosecutors described a statement police said Seabra gave after the January 7 death of Mr Castro while the two were on holiday in Manhattan. The account depicted an argument in a . hotel room that turned vicious and escalated into a prolonged hour-long . frenzy, with Seabra first choking his companion, then stabbing him with a . corkscrew in his face and groin. Seabra . also admitted to hitting Mr Castro on the head with a computer monitor . and stamping on his face while wearing shoes, the papers said. After the attack Seabra told police, he showered, put on a suit and left. Ambitious: Castro brought Seabra out to New York where the 21-year-old was hoping to get modeling jobs through a Manhattan agency . The 21-year-old, Seabra, was a contestant in 2010 on a Portuguese television show called A Procura Do Sonho, or 'Pursuit Of A Dream', which hunts for modelling talent. Although he did not win the show, he gained a modelling contract with an agency founded by designer Fatima Lopes, who developed the show and was a judge. Testimony begins Wednesday, with . Castro’s friend Wanda Perez expected to take the stand to describe the . victim’s growing fear of his young lover in the days leading up to the . murder.","Portuguese fashion journalist Carlos Castro, 65, was found murdered at the interContenial hotel in Manhattan in 2011 .

A manager at a homeless people’s charity helped herself to £361,000 by writing herself cheques and used the cash to renovate her house and go shopping at Marks and Spencer. Samantha Wilding, from Bristol, forged signatures to write herself cheques and used a company credit card at Marks & Spencer and to stay at a hotel. The mother-of-three stole the money when she worked for Way Ahead Housing, which merged into charity Independent People, Bristol Crown Court heard. Caught out: Samantha Wilding, pictured outside Bristol Crown Court, admitted stealing more than £350,000 from the homeless charity she worked at as a manager . The court also heard that the cost of her home renovations got out of hand and that she needed the extra money to tide her over. Wilding, 46, pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud as well as a charge of theft, spanning from 2005 to last year. Judge Carol Hagen told her: 'This was a very substantial fraud over a long period of time. It represents a gross breach of trust.' Caighli Taylor, prosecuting, said Wilding was employed as a corporate services director from 2001, dealing with finance, human resources and administration. Audacious: Wilding spent the cash on renovations to her home and trips to Marks and Spencer, Bristol Crown Court, pictured, heard . Miss Taylor said: 'She had access to bank accounts, financial systems, the company chequebook and credit card. She was a signatory to the company’s bank accounts.' When forged cheques were noticed by the company, Wilding offered to resign, the court heard. Further forged cheques materialised, including one in which Wilding forged the signature of a colleague on maternity leave. Miss Taylor said Wilding put £452.01 on the company credit card with a trip to Liverpool, Marks & Spencer and a hotel. The theft charge related to her taking £60 from a 'staff rent tin', the court heard. The long-term fraud meant the charity lost means for future investment, Miss Taylor told the court.Jason Taylor, defending, said: “Clearly, this has to be custody. 'Miss Wilding has said she needs to face the consequences. She understands she should be punished.' Theft: Ms Wilding spent some of the stolen money from the charity in the Marks and Spencer chain. File photo . Mr Taylor said his client had wanted to extend her house for £25,000, but the project escalated to £45,000. He said: 'Her intention was that money borrowed would be just to tide her over. She did not lead an extravagant lifestyle. She replaced the bathroom and they went to Spain for a week. 'Over time the money mounted up. A trail would always lead back to her because her signature was on the cheques. It took six years and she has now admitted the offences completely.' Wilding was sentenced to two years in prison last Friday.","Samantha Wilding, 46, from Bristol, forged cheques while manager at charity Way Ahead Housing ."

Eight people are dead and at least 105 are ill as from an outbreak of fungal meningitis sweeping America after tainted steroid injections. The eighth fatality was in Tennessee. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the count on Monday. The list of nine states with reported cases stayed the same. Tennessee, Michigan, Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina and Ohio previously reported cases. Health officials investigating the cause of the rare inflammatory disease discovered fungal contamination of a batch of spinal steroid injections, often used for pain, made by The New England Compounding Center and have advised health professionals against using any of its products. Beware: Health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections from July to September could be at risk. At least 8 have died (stock photo) Identifying: The pharmacy's products can be identified by its acronym NECC or its logo, pictured . The pharmacy issued a recall of all its products on Saturday calling their decision a precautionary measure with no other products indicated as being contaminated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted updated figures to its website on Monday showing there are 101 confirmed cases of the rare form of fungal meningitis. The steroid linked to the outbreak had already been recalled, and health officials have been scrambling to notify anyone who may have received an injection of it. Dr. Benjamin Park of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised: If patients are concerned, they should contact their physician to find out if they received a medicine from one of these lots. Outbreak: Aspergillus meningitis, pictured, is caused by the inflammation of protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord and is not contagious . He went on to say that most cases have occurred in older adults seeking treatment for back pain who were otherwise healthy. The Massachusetts pharmacy that made it has said it is cooperating with investigators. It is not yet known exactly how many people may have been affected, though it could affect hundreds or even thousands of people who received the steroid injections for back pain from July to September. Meningitis is caused by the inflammation of protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Fungal meningitis is not contagious as are its more common viral and bacterial counterparts. The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the FDA. The sixth and seventh fatalities were reported in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths over the weekend. The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis . The fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs . Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee . hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical . treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across . the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee . 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. The injectable steroids responsible . for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a . specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. An unknown number of their 17,676 single-dose vials of . the steroid reached 75 clinics . and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal . health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have . been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. Stepping back: The FDA previously told specialists not to administer New England Compounding Center's products but only on Saturday did the pharmacy admit a potential problem . However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported . Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths . Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota . Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid . Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very . seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan . said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the . meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found . the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center . released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to . discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist . Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company . web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the . state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the . broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. The pharmacy has produced questionable . products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of . four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease . producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave . reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock . That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled.","Two more deaths were reported on Saturday and another Monday bringing total to 8 .

The slaughter of a British family in the Alps could be linked to money found hidden in a Geneva bank account. The cash was in the name of Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his dentist wife Iqbal, 47. The couple died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire that also killed Mr Al-Hilli’s Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, and Sylvain Mollier, a passing cyclist. Policemen investigate the scene of the murder in the forest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps. Money found in bank accounts belonging to the family has now been seized . The couple’s two young daughters survived the attack, although the elder was seriously injured. Detectives admitted this week they . were still baffled by the motive for the attack close to Lake Annecy, in . eastern France, on September 5. But Swiss prosecutor Dario Zanni is . working on the theory that the secret bank account is linked with the . quadruple murder – and that Mr Al-Hilli may have been in a Geneva bank . shortly before the slaughter. Last night a source close to the case . speculated that the ‘sizeable amount of cash’ could provide the key to . the killings, and that Mr Al-Hilli could even have had large sums of . money from the account on him when he was killed. One report from Switzerland suggested that Mr Al-Hilli had visited the bank shortly before he was killed. Victim: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was murdered near the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie region of France alongside his wife and mother-in-law . Geneva is just an hour’s drive from . where the massacre took place, in an isolated layby on the outskirts of . the village of Chevaline. Mr Zanni, who was appointed by French . investigators, believes the entire family may have been returning from . the Swiss city when the ambush took place. The Al-Hillis were shot repeatedly in . the head and body as they sat in the family’s BMW. The bank account . seized in Geneva was once in the name of Mr Al-Hilli’s recently deceased . father, Kadhim. Mr Al-Hilli has been said to have been involved in a dispute with his elder brother, Zaid, 53, over their father’s will. While Saad was an engineer on . satellite and electronics projects, Zaid works for the Burhill Group, a . golf and leisure company, at its head office in Walton-on-Thames in . Surrey, close to where he owns a home. The brothers are joint owners of the . family home, worth about £1million, in Claygate, Surrey, although Zaid . moved out about a year ago, around the time their father died in Spain. A legal document appears to show that Saad had attempted to block the terms of his father’s will being carried out. And the engineer had told a childhood . friend he had cut links with his older brother after ‘underhand things’ took place over their late father’s estate, . The family is said to be worth many millions, with reports of further properties in Spain, France and Iraq. Zaid has not spoken publicly about the . tragedy but has been interviewed by police on a number of occasions, . each time denying he was in dispute with his brother. Poignant: Cyclists ride past flowers left at the scene of the killing outside the nearby village of Chevaline . Concern: The Al-Hilli's home in Claygate, Surrey. Speculation still surrounds the motive for the shootings in which three members of the family died . It has emerged that colour photographs . showing the Al-Hillis minutes before the attack have been found by . detectives inside the family’s BMW. All were taken in front of a picturesque house covered in flowers outside Doussard, a town close to the village of Chevaline. The Al-Hillis’ four-year-old daughter, Zeena, survived the attack unscathed after hiding under her mother’s corpse. Her seven-year-old sister, Zainab, was badly injured, suffering serious head injuries and a bullet wound in a shoulder. According to others who have seen the . photographs, dates and times are shown, meaning they can be placed in a . series of events which ended up with the quadruple murder. Detectives fear all were drawn into a suspected ambush by one or more professional hitmen on the outskirts of Chevaline. As 100 officers on both sides of the . Channel struggle with the case, Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud said on . Thursday: ‘We’re investigating everything but it all takes a lot of . time, trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have . died.’","Money seized after investigators discovered bank accounts linked to Al-Hilli family in Geneva .

Luke Walker, 24, from Brierley Hill, . near Dudley, West Midlands, is accused of attacking girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, inflicting fatal injuries. His previous bail conditions stated that he must remain on the island, but he was today told he could await the next stage in his trial at home - because judges in Greece are on strike. Scroll down for video . Tense moment: Luke Walker, 22, arrives at court today, left, at the start of his trial for allegedly murdering his 20-year-old girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, right . Downcast: Walker, right, will present 11 witnesses to the court in an effort to prove his girlfriend died from a fall rather than from him attacking her . His family looked emotional and some burst into tears as they heard the news at Heraklion Mixed Court today. Walker denies murder and claims that Ms Hyndman, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, . fell after a night out in the resort town of Malia, Crete, where . they both lived and worked in bars. The 20-year-old waitress died after she was admitted to hospital in Heraklion with abdominal pains in May 2010. Two post-mortem examinations have been carried out on her body, evidence from which is expected to play a key role in the trial. After the four jurors were sworn in today, Walker spoke through an interpreter to confirm his identity. He gave his occupation as 'electrician' and told the three judges he lived in Stalis, a coastal resort in Crete. The court sat for less than an hour before adjourning because key prosecution witnesses had not been summoned. Carefree: Ms Hyndman and Walker were both living on the Greek island and working in bars . Many of the witnesses in the case had flown in from Britain. Ms Hyndman's mother, Heather, and her family sat in the front rows of the public gallery. Walker's solicitor, George Pyromallis, asked that the defendant be allowed to return to England on bail. The 24-year-old has spent the last two-and-a-half years in Crete, initially on remand for five months before he was granted bail at on the condition he did not leave the island. Speaking after the hearing, Walker said it was the 'best outcome so far'. He said: 'I expected the trial to go ahead today - I thought this would be it now. 'I haven't even thought about what I'll do when I get home. It hasn't crossed my mind. 'I'm actually feeling a bit scared about it but it's amazing news. Frustrating: The family of Ms Hyndman, right, left the court without speaking to the media after the trial was adjourned to an unspecified date . 'All I want to do is clear my name. It's been a nightmare; horrible. Work has been difficult, I can't get jobs. 'But my family and friends have been amazing and really supported me. I can't thank them enough.' Walker said he was 'chuffed' to be coming home, and paid tribute to the girlfriend he is accused of beating to death - saying she was the 'love of my life.' 'I had fully prepared myself to fight my case - but I'm chuffed that I'll be going home,' he said. 'I haven't felt safe here since my arrest. I've been stuck in a prison cell where nobody speaks English. 'There were about 18 people in a 10 man cell, and I had to climb over people to even get to a toilet. It's been hell. Nights out: Walker said he had been in 'hell' since Ms Hyndman's death, and that she was the 'love of his life' 'It has been such a mental battle to deal with all this. Chelsea was the love of my life and I'm determined to protest my innocence in court. 'But right now, all I want to do is go back home. I came to Crete to enjoy the sun and sand - I never thought I could miss the Black Country so much.' He will return to Brierley Hill with his family and may work in the family's electrical business. His parents, who have been regularly visiting him at his apartment in Crete, said they were relieved at the development. 'I'm just so glad he's going home,' said his father, Patrick. 'But to know it's not over and we still have the trial to come is hard. 'It's going to be hard for Luke too. He hasn't been to England in two-and-a-half years so it'll take some settling in.' Party town: Walker has now been in Crete for two-and-a-half years, where he originally worked in a bar in Malia, pictured . He added that the family will return home from Stalis, a 25-minute drive from Heraklion, as soon as bail has been arranged. Ms Hyndman's family left without speaking to the media. The first stage of the trial was . originally scheduled for today and tomorrow, but a strike by Greek . judges reduced it to a day, with a date for further hearings yet to be . set. Judges will be on strike each day in . Greece until October 31 as industrial action continues across the . country, with metro workers and doctors also staging walkouts in protest . at Government cuts. Walker . intends to present 11 witnesses as he tries to disprove the . prosecution’s claims that Ms Hyndman's injuries were caused after he . flew into a fit of jealous rage.

Sunday’s attempts to use human rights legislation to prevent Home Office . ministers from removing him to Nigeria for a third time were . 'breathtaking' An exasperated judge yesterday attacked a failed asylum seeker's bid to use human rights law to stay in Britain as 'breathtaking'. Nigerian Gbenga Sunday has already cost the taxpayer more than £100,000 after being kicked out of the country twice, only to re-enter Britain within months. But in an astonishing example of the immigration merry-go-round, his lawyers went to court yesterday to argue he should be allowed to stay here – this time because he said he was in a relationship with a Lithuanian woman. As a result, they claimed, sending Mr Sunday home would breach his right to a private and family life under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. The application for judicial review was dismissed out of hand by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, who said the applicant's attempt to use human rights laws to prevent him from being flown back to Nigeria for a third time was 'breathtaking'. 'This is an incredible case,' said the judge, at a High Court hearing in London. 'This is a case where the claimant has not been removed once but twice. This is the third time. What on earth is going on? 'Why should the court waste any more public money?' He added: 'This case is so ... utterly without merit that no further public money should be wasted in dealing with it.' Mr Sunday, 38, first came to the notice of immigration officials in 2004 when he applied for indefinite leave to remain in Britain. This was refused the following year and he was served with illegal entry papers telling him he would be sent home. He then launched an asylum application, but withdrew it within a year. In 2005, he was put on a plane to Nigeria by the Home Office and told he would not be allowed back in. However by 2006 he had returned to the UK and made a second asylum application. This too was withdrawn. The same year he was put on a plane and sent home. Despite twice having been removed, he was able to return to the UK within a year in November 2006. In 2007, he was arrested when he tried to open a bank account with a forged passport. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the case was 'incredible' and 'breath-taking' at the High Court in London . Again he was served with illegal entry . papers and told he would be kicked out. But instead of being put in . detention he was granted bail and went on the run. He lived freely in the UK until this . year when he was arrested by chance during a raid by immigration . officers. He was set to be deported for the third time in May, but . launched yet another appeal just weeks before his flight date. He claimed he had started a . relationship with a woman from Lithuania. Marriage to an EU national can . confer rights to live in Britain. But this appeal was rejected by officials because they found no evidence of any relationship. His lawyers then applied for a . judicial review in June, which was refused, but Mr Sunday applied again . in July and the case finally came before a judge yesterday. Last year nearly 3,200 migrants were given the right to stay in Britain as a result of Article 8 rulings. Home Secretary Theresa May has made . changes to immigration rules which will make it harder for migrants to . use Article 8 as a reason to remain in Britain. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: . 'This demonstrates why we're determined to deal with these cases more . quickly. Our tough new immigration rules will prevent individuals from . abusing the legal process with frivolous claims. We are pursuing his . removal as a matter of urgency.'","Judge said Gbenga .

Man with money: Andy Ashkar, 34, of Camillus, came forward on March 1, just 11 days before the top prize in the '$500,000,000 Extravaganza' scratch-off game would have expired . A lottery winner waited six years to claim his  $5million prize to ensure his fiancee married him for love and not his money. Andy Ashkar, 34, of Camillus, came forward on March 1, just 11 days before the '$500,000,000 Extravaganza' scratch-off card would have . expired, New York Lottery said. Mr Ashkar said he bought the ticket at . his parents' convenience store in Syracuse in 2006 and has decided to share . the winnings with his brother Nayel. The agency said the younger brother . said he waited so long to claim his prize because he was concerned the . windfall could 'negatively influence' his life if he didn't plan . properly before being publicly introduced as the winner. Andy . Ashkar also told lottery officials that he also didn't want the . windfall to influence his engagement and subsequent marriage. Calls to phone numbers listed for the Ashkar brothers went unanswered Wednesday morning. The . brothers' mother, Wasa Ashkar, said her husband, Neyef, sold the . winning ticket to Andy at the couple's Green Ale Market, but she . couldn't remember exactly when. In an interview with MailOnline, Mrs Ashkar said that they are now known as 'the good luck' store because of her son's big win. She said that while they have never had a similar multi-million dollar win, there have been a number of smaller victories in their shop. A few years ago, a woman won $700,000 in a similar scratch-off game. Scroll down for video . Lucky win: Andy Ashkar bought the ticket at his parents' convenience store in Syracuse in 2006, pictured .

Of course I'm happy,' she told The Associated Press over the . phone before ending the conversation because she was busy with customers . Wednesday morning. Nayel Ashkar's wife, Sara, told The . Post-Standard of Syracuse on Tuesday that news of the winnings was . spreading fast, with family and friends calling to express their . surprise and excitement. 'It's crazy,' she said. 'Hard to believe. It's still sinking in.' According to The Post-Standard, the big winner splurged on a $290,000 house in his hometown last year. His brother Nayel and his wife Sara spent $236,000 for their house in Cicero in 2008. Lottery spokeswoman Carolyn Hapeman said the brothers claimed their prize at the agency's Schenectady headquarters on March 1. Organized: Ashkar, whose brother is pictured here, waited so long to claim his prize because he was concerned the windfall could 'negatively influence' his life if he didn't plan properly before being publicly introduced as the winner . Big purchase: Andy Ashkar reportedly bought this house on Cobbler Way in Camillus for $290,000 in 2011 . Unlike winning tickets for games such as . Lotto and Mega Million that expire in a year, tickets for scratch-off . games expire a year after a game is retired. The Extravaganza game was retired on March 12, 2011, Hapeman said. As is routine whenever a winner is related to the owner of the store that sold the ticket, the agency conducted an investigation. The inquiry determined Ashkar's scratch-off ticket was bought legitimately, Hapeman said. The Ashkar brothers, both employed as managers at separate central New York auto dealerships, will be introduced at a news conference at a later date, the lottery spokeswoman said.","Andy Ashkar, 34, and Nayel Ashkar, 36, came forward  just 11 days before the top prize would have expired .

If so, you could be suffering from a deficiency from the sunshine vitamin - vitamin D. New figures have revealed the true extent of what the UK's so-called vitamin D deficiency 'epidemic', with one in nine people classed as 'deficient' and two thirds as 'severely lacking'. A deficiency in vitamin D, 90 per cent of which is generated by sunlight, can cause depression, migraines, joint pain and low energy levels . Vitamin D is generated by sunlight (90 per cent) and diet (10 per cent). But the survey by BetterYou found that 77 per cent of adults spend most of their . day indoors in office jobs, seldom seeing the sunshine. Vitamin D boosts the immune system, and without sufficient intake, the body's cells are not able to react and fight off serious . infections in the body. Common medical conditions associated with vitamin D . deficiency include fatigue, bone pain, muscle pain, joint pain, migraines, skin pigmentation problems and even rickets. Many people with a vitamin D deficiency develop Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and become depressed. National Vitamin D Awareness Week, which begins on 28 October, aims to raise public understanding of the dangers of developing the deficiency through lack of sunlight . Over 70 per cent of people questioned in the survey for BetterYou said they spend most of their day indoors, a factor which can contribute to a deficiency in Vitamin D . Almost half of those surveyed also said . they regularly suffer with low energy levels, and 40 per . cent experienced regular aches and pains in their bones and joints. Both . are key symptoms of deficiency. The findings, announced ahead of a National . Vitamin D Awareness Week, suggest a massive proportion of the UK population are at risk . of these debilitating symptoms. Office lifestyles have contributed to the British vitamin D epidemic, with people spending less time in the sunshine than ever before . Of . those diagnosed as severely deficient, 71 per cent do not . take any form of supplement - highlighting a clear link between . deficiency and supplementation. The findings come from a survey . by health pioneers BetterYou, who are supporting National Vitamin D . Awareness Week, which aims to raise public understanding of the dangers . of deficiency. Andrew Thomas, founder and managing director at . BetterYou, said: 'Our findings further confirm what we have long . suspected, that our nation is far more deficient in vitamin D than we . would care to admit. 'Almost ninety per cent of people . interviewed provided either classic symptoms of advanced vitamin D . deficiency or listed multiple lifestyle conditions which would . predispose them to be deficient. 'These include a combination of having . darker skin pigmentation, spending daylight hours indoors and excessive . use of UV sun cream. 'These findings simply reinforce our support . of the UK's first National Vitamin D Awareness Week. The subject has . been discussed in the House of Commons, leading to ""at risk"" groups . being identified and supplementation recommendations made by our . Department of Health. 'The awareness week is the natural next step to . raise understanding with the general public.' Earlier this year the . Chief Medical Officer for England, Dame Sally Davies announced her . concerns to health professionals regarding a rise in vitamin D-related . conditions, asking them to consider vitamin D supplementation for at . risk groups, including pregnant mothers.

Killed: Aya Hadir Ghais, who was in the UAE to study, died after the high-powered Lamborghini she was driving crashed and caught fire . An American teenage student has died after the Lamborghini she was driving crashed and caught fire in Abu Dhabi. Authorities in the United Arab Emirate's capital said that Aya Hadir Ghais, 19, was travelling in the high-powered vehicle alone when the horrific accident happened on Saturday. Despite firefighters arriving on the scene in Defence Road within four minutes and extinguishing the fire, she could not be freed in time. The teenager, who friends say dreamed of one day being a mother, had been married for two years. Her Lebanese husband Makram Ghais flew to his home country on Sunday with her body to prepare for the funeral. The couple married when Aya was 17 and she took up her studies at the Paris Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi when he moved there to work for a UAE-based company. Aya is the eldest sibling to a sister, Sarah, 18, and two brothers, all of whom live with her parents in Lebanon. Speaking to The National, . Captain Abdullah Al Tamimi, from Abu Dhabi Civil Defence, said: 'She . must have been driving too fast. Her car hit the kerb, overturned and . caught fire.' Mrs Ghais was studying law and economics at and was extremely popular. On Monday around 100 of the teenager's grieving friends held a memorial walk for Aya, where they recited verses from the Quran, read poetry, carried candles and roses and released white balloons in memory of their friend. 'She was always cheerful, very dedicated and hardworking. She was on her way to the campus library on Saturday when the incident happened,' said Ruba Obaid, a 20-year-old student of economics at the university. Beauty: Mrs Ghais was married to husband Makram when she was 17 and the couple lived in the UAE . Family: Aya with her sister Sarah (pictured left) had left her family in Lebanon to go with her husband to Abu Dhabi . Loss: The young woman, who holds both American and Lebanese passports, was killed in her sports car on Saturday afternoon . 'We used to see each other every day in university. She was always happy, always smiling and I am sure she never, ever hurt anyone. 'If she saw anyone crying, whether she knew that person or not, she would go ahead and help them,” said Rama Hattab, an 18-year-old student who was also Aya’s roommate during a ski trip. Rama said it was only the second time she had driven the powerful car. 'It was her second time to ride this . car which came for her from Lebanon. I thank God that she died instantly . at the crash and did not suffer for long,' she said. Ms . Ghais crashed on a bridge entering Al Reem Island, described as a 'chic . urban metropolis' of shopping, hotels and luxurious homes. Memorial walk organiser, Issam Kabbara, told 7 Days in Dubai that he hopes the walk will become an annual event to remember Aya and others killed in road traffic accidents. Horrific: Pictures from the scene of the crash show the Lamborghini going up in flames after it crashed on Saturday . Desperate battle: Firefighters put out the flames but were unable to save the student . 'I had a crash when the same bridge was being built. My car turned over on its roof and was written off. 'I . know how dangerous it can be. Be remembering our friend Aya, we can . also highlight road safety too,' said Kabbara, a Romanian-Lebanese . student. He described her . as 'a wonderful person who always had a smile for everyone and who was . really admired'. He knew her when he trained the university women’s . football team when Aya was a member. 'She played football very well, she played basketball and she was a great student,' he added.

Awkward sex scenes. Size 12 bodies. Spanx. Naked cake-eating. Uncomfortable jokes about sexually transmitted diseases. Described as 'a show for smart people'. This certainly ain't Friends. This is Girls, the new hit comedy series about a group of four 'real' twenty-something female friends living in New York. (So it's obviously not Sex And The City, either). It has proved an unequivocal - and deliciously controversial - smash hit across America since its April premiere. And now it is finally coming to Britain. Lena Dunham is the 26-year-old creative whizz-kid behind (and, as it happens, in the front of) HBO's groundbreaking new show. Not only did she write, produce and direct Girls - with the executive production assistance of Judd Apatow - she also stars in it as protagonist Hannah Horvath. Describing her show, Dunham says: 'I always thought the saddest feeling in life is when you're dancing in a really joyful way and then you hit your head on something. 'It's sad and embarrassing and I feel like Hannah's entire life is like dancing and then hitting her head on something.' Dunham - who has just signed a publishing deal worth over $3.5million (£2.2million) with Random House for her first book, and who appeared in the opening sketch for this year's Emmys sitting naked on a loo, eating cake - received initial hostility from some critics. Scroll down for video . They're here! Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke, Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet in Girls, crossing the Atlantic and coming to Sky Atlantic this month . They complained she appeared naked too much in the comedy - particularly for someone who, they felt, did not fit the standard Hollywood 'size zero' mould. Speaking to The Times' Caitlin Moran on the Girls set in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Dunham explained that her motives for such a wealth of scantily clad dancing scenes are 'varied'. She said: 'There's a part of me that . goes, ""You think I'm chubby? Well, LOOK AT ME NAKED."" Then there's also . sometimes some feeling of rage.

The girls: The actresses - Dunham is far left - film a scene on the steps of a SoHo townhouse in lower Manhattan . But . Dunham confesses that she never intended Girls to be so keenly focused . on the idea of a 'normal', healthy-looking woman: 'It’s funny, because . it didn't come out exactly the way I saw it in my head. 'When . I imagine myself walking down the street, and then see footage of . myself walking down the street, it doesn't look the same. 'In . my brain, I've always been ten notches more classically beautiful than I . am. In my brain, I've always been really gorgeous – and they just don’t . get it yet.
