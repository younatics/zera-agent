"Nigel Pearson’s default mood is bullish. Troublesome fan? Tell him to **** off and die. Upended in the technical area by a rival player? Grab him by the throat while he lies on the floor. The enduring image from 24 hours which do not put anyone at Leicester City in a good light will be of their manager bending over Crystal Palace’s James McArthur, his hands round the player’s neck. Smiling, certainly, a bit of banter, perhaps. Yet it appears the choke has backfired spectacularly.

McArthur (centre) slides into Pearson after he is upended by Leicester midfielder Marc Albrighton . McArthur (right) tries to walk away from Pearson, who keeps his hand grasped on to the shirt . Palace midfielder McArthur pulls away, trying to move from Pearson, who keeps a hold . 6.30PM The story breaks that Nigel Pearson has been sacked by Leicester . 8.00PM Fans and ex-players react, with Gary Lineker tweeting: ‘Not surprised Pearson has been fired.’ 9.45PM After hours of silence from the club, reports begin to leak that Pearson may still be in charge. 10.07PM Leicester finally release a statement saying that Pearson has NOT been sacked... 10.12PM ... but too late to stop ITV News reporting that he has gone. Leicester’s Thai owners, the Srivaddhanaprabha family, have been a patient lot, backing Pearson earlier in the season and sacking director of football Terry Robinson instead, blaming him for failures in the transfer market last summer. In January the club went out on a limb and paid a record £9million for Andrej Kramaric, who started on the bench against Palace in what was billed as a must-win game. That’s a very expensive backside and one can only imagine what Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who made his fortune through duty free franchises, thought when he bowled up on Saturday. By the final whistle there were other factors to consider, not least the fact that Leicester, who take on Arsenal away on Tuesday, are in danger of being cast adrift at the bottom of the table. Then there was that extraordinary moment involving McArthur which started as a laugh and finished with a snarl. Pearson smilingly put his hands round McArthur’s throat while the Palace man lay on the floor after he had accidentally sent Pearson flying in the final minutes of Palace’s win at the King Power Stadium. Pearson then hauled the player to his feet before grabbing McArthur’s shirt and refusing to release him.

'Leicester City Football Club would like to clarify its position relative to its manager, Nigel Pearson. 'Contrary to media speculation on Sunday evening, Nigel remains the Club’s First Team Manager. Reports to the contrary are inaccurate and without foundation. 'Nigel, his staff and the first team squad are entirely focused on Tuesday night’s trip to Arsenal and our continued efforts to secure our position in the Barclays Premier League.' A clearly rattled McArthur pulled away, mouthing ‘Get off me’ and rival manager Alan Pardew came over to see what was happening. When Pearson said he was only playing around, McArthur is understood to have replied that the stranglehold was hurting his throat. Afterwards Pearson, who failed in an attempt to sign McArthur from Wigan last summer, only managed to muddy the waters even more. ‘He said something to me,’ said Pearson. ‘I don’t have to reveal anything, do I? I think I’m more than capable of looking after myself.’ The Leicester manager added: ‘I have no problem with the lad. He’s a likeable lad. I’m as disappointed as he was with how things (his transfer) panned out. ‘But it’s the other football club (Wigan) which was involved in it who take absolute responsibility for anything that wasn’t quite right. And a certain manager (then Wigan boss Uwe Rosler), who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut.’ The fourth official (centre) intervenes as McArthur (right) and Pearson clash on the touchline . Pearson (centre) keeps having words with McArthur (left) as the fourth official urges for calm . Pearson shouts instructions at his Foxes side during the 1-0 loss against Palace on Saturday . 1 - Leicester have won just one of their past nine Premier League home games. 38 - Goals conceded this season — only QPR (43) and Burnley (40) have shipped more. 3 - Only three teams with 17 points or fewer at this stage in the season have ever escaped relegation from the Premier League — Wigan (11-12), West Brom (04-05) and Fulham (07-08). 21 - Goals scored this season — only Aston Villa (12) have scored fewer. 16.7 - Leicester’s win percentage this season from 24 matches. That has been the Pearson mantra. In private, with a cup of tea and an off-the-record agenda, he is good company but the public persona loves to pick a fight. On Saturday, he berated a young local reporter for not asking tough enough questions about the failure to start Kramaric, which was somewhat strange, too, as if he was using it as a dress rehearsal for the owners. They stood by him when he got involved with a serial abuser behind the technical area. His argument was that he was defending his staff and he accepted the fine and ban for telling the fan ‘**** off and die’. He retained the support of his employers, who stuck by him when he missed out on promotion the first time and who expected nothing less than a relegation battle this season, if ultimately a successful one. He also had most of the fans and players on his side. In fact, there was nothing in the body language to suggest anything untoward on Saturday night, although Pearson was not particularly chatty with the media. Pearson (centre) helps McArthur (left) back to his feet following the incident at the King Power Stadium . McArthur (right) tries to pull away from Leicester boss Pearson on Saturday . Perhaps the owners stayed up to watch Match of the Day on which there were plenty of scratched heads after what happened with McArthur. Presenter Gary Lineker, who  tweeted he wasn’t surprised Pearson had been ‘axed on Sunday’, said of Saturday’s incident: ‘It was a bizarre piece of behaviour. Peculiar circumstances.’ Jermaine Jenas commented: ‘Completely bizarre. It looked a total accident but it’s that point, where he grabs him round the throat, that’s where it changes. The whole reaction in the interview shocked me a little bit. I thought it would be a lot more jovial. You can see McArthur is not happy.’ Danny Murphy added: ‘Maybe there is something underlying about the proposed transfer that did not happen.’ McArthur took to social media, tweeting: ‘Situation with me and Nigel Pearson is getting blown out of proportion.’ On the pitch, Joe Ledley’s headed goal kept Leicester rooted to the bottom of the Premier League.","Leicester manager Nigel Pearson appeared to grab James McArthur .

"More than 25 people are believed to have died after a riot broke out before a top-flight football match in Egypt on Sunday. The riot, only three years after similar violence killed 74 people, began ahead of a match between Egyptian Premier League clubs Zamalek and ENPPI at Air Defense Stadium east of Cairo. Such attacks in the past have sparked days of violent protests pitting the country's hardcore fans against police officers in a nation already on edge after years of revolt and turmoil. An Egyptian man wearing a mask of the anonymous movement gestures near a burning car . A burning car is shown outside the Air Defense Stadium following clashes between fans and police . Firefighters try to extinguish a fire on a truck as a riot broke out outside of a major football match . Fans flock in droves outside the Air Defense Stadium to watch a match between Zamalek and ENPPI . Policemen and fans are seen through barbed wire as fans attempt to enter the stadium . Two security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least 25 people were killed. All football fixtures in Egypt have been postponed with immediate effect. What caused the violence wasn't immediately clear. Security officials said Zamalek fans tried to force their way into the match without tickets, sparking clashes. Fans have only recently been allowed back at matches and the Interior Ministry planned to only let 10,000 fans into the stadium, which has a capacity of about 30,000, the officials said. Zamalek fans, known as 'White Knights,' posted on their group's official Facebook page that the violence began because authorities only opened one narrow, barbed-wire door to let them in. They said that sparked pushing and shoving that later saw police officers fire tear gas and birdshot. A fan who tried to attend the game, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted by police, said that the stampede was caused by police who fired tear gas at the tightly packed crowd. 'Those who fell down could not get back up again,' the man said. The Zamalek fan group later posted pictures on Facebook it claimed were of dead fans, including the names of 22 people it said had been killed. The AP could not immediately verify the images, nor their casualty count. Policemen and  fans argue during a scuffle as fans attempt to enter a stadium to watch the match . Football fans argue with security personnel as they attempt to enter the stadium before a riot broke out . More than 20 people are believed to have been killed after riots broke out on the outskirts of Cairo . Egypt's hard-core soccer fans, known as Ultras, frequently clash with police inside and outside of stadiums. They are deeply politicized and many participated in the country's 2011 uprising that forced out President Hosni Mubarak. Many consider them as one of the most organized movements in Egypt after the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, which the government later outlawed as a terrorist organization following the 2013 military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. The violence comes as police come under increasing scrutiny following the shooting death of a female protester in Cairo and the arrest of protesters under a law largely banning demonstrations. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has pledged bring stability to Egypt amid bombings and attacks by Islamic militants, but also has said Egypt's emergency situation meant that some violations of human rights were inevitable, if regrettable. One of the burning vehicles outside the stadium as football fans clashed with police and security forces . The deadliest riot in Egyptian football history came during a 2012 match when Port Said's Al-Masry team hosted Cairo's Al-Ahly. That riot, at the time the deadliest worldwide since 1996, killed 74 people, mostly Al-Ahly fans. Two police officers later received 15-year prison sentences for gross negligence and failure to stop the Port Said killings, a rare incident of security officials being held responsible for deaths in the country. Seven other officers were acquitted, angering soccer fans who wanted more police officers to be held accountable for the incident and other episodes of violence. In response, angry fans burned down the headquarters of Egypt's Football Association, also protesting its decision to resume matches before bringing those behind that 2012 riot to justice. They've also protested and fought officers outside of the country's Interior Ministry, which oversees police in the country.","Riots broke out in Cairo ahead of Zamalek's clash with ENPPI on Sunday .

"A Spanish pilot was killed today when his Eurofighter jet smashed into the ground as it came in to land. It is not yet clear why the jet crashed just next to the runway of the Moron de la Frontera airbase, near Seville, at 2pm this afternoon. The 30-year-old pilot, who was from Madrid, had logged 600 hours of experience flying the combat jet. Tragic: The scene where a pilot of a Eurofighter combat jet fatally crashed his fighter just short of the runway at Spanish air force base Moron de la Frontera near Seville, Andalusia, Spain earlier today . The accident was the third involving a Eurofighter in Spain in just under a decade, Spanish media reported. A Saudi national died in a Eurofighter crash in 2010, also at the Moron base, just after taking off during a training flight with a Spanish co-pilot, who was injured. There was also a previous accident with a Eurofighter prototype at another base in Spain, with no casualties, according to local media. Eurofighters are built by British defence company BAE Systems, European aerospace group Airbus and Italy's Finmeccanica. The RAF currently operates 95 Eurofighters, known in the service as Typhoons, across five squadrons. They make up part of the permanent garrison on the Falklands as well as operating out of two bases on the UK mainland. While the RAF's Typhoon fleet was temporarily grounded following the 2010 crash at Moron de la Frontera, there have been no accidents involving the UK pilots save for one incident in the U.S. in 2008 when one crash landed after, it was suspected, its pilot forgot to lower his landing gear.

Spain agreed to acquire 87 Eurofighters just over a decade ago, and has an option to buy 16 more between 2003 and 2018, according to the Defence Ministry. Makers of the Eurofighter have faced tough competition for overseas jet orders from manufacturers of rival models such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the U.S. and Saab of Sweden.","It is not yet clear why the jet crashed just next to the runway at the airbase .

"Ivory Coast won their first Africa Cup of Nations since 1992 in dramatic fashion, beating Ghana 9-8 on penalties. Wilfried Bony smashed his spot-kick against the crossbar but the Elephants recovered in the shoot-out, eventually taking the title when goalkeeper Boubacar Barry saved from his opposite number Razak Braimah and then stepped up to score. It was an exciting end to a game that had been anything but, with Premier League stars Bony and Yaya Toure unable to create enough to win the game in 90, or even 120 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Ivory Coast 0(9)-0(8) Ghana . The Ivory Coast team and staff pose with their Africa Cup of Nations trophy having defeated Ghana 9-8 on penalties on Sunday night . Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony holds up hero Boubacar Barry (centre), who scored the winning penalty in the final in Bata . The Ivory Coast team celebrate landing the Africa Cup of Nations on penalties, their first AFCON title since 1992 . Ghana (4-3-3): Razak; Boye, Rahman, Mensah, Afful; Mubarak, Acquah, Ayew; Atsu (Acheampong, 115), Gyan (Agyemang-Badu, 120) Appiah (Ayew, 98) Subs not used: Sowah, Gyimah, Awal, Rabiu, Asante, Otoo, Amartey, Accam, Dauda . Ivory Coast (4-4-2): Barry; Bailly, Aurier, Kanon, Toure; Tiene (Kalou, 114), Die, Toure, Gradel (Doumbia, 66); Bony, Gervinho (Tallo, 120) Subs not used: Mande, Viera, Roger, Doukoure, Akpa Akpro, Diomande, Traore . Booked: Die, Tiene, Kanon, Bailly . Referee: Bakary Gassama . Toure forced Razak Brimah into a save from an early free kick, and was generally more involved than he has been in the tournament’s previous games. However, once again, the Ivorian captain was less than the star we know he can be when played further forward. Ahead of him Bony was even more frustrated, unable to get into the game and carrying none of the goal-threat that saw him become the Premier League’s top scorer in 2014. Time after time City’s newest striker failed to hold the ball, or to find a team-mate once he had got it under control. Indeed, as has been the case for much of this season, the City stars were outshone for most of the game by a Chelsea counterpart. Christian Atsu, who has shown throughout this tournament why Everton made such an effort to secure him on loan this season, was the best player on the pitch for much of the game. His excellent play on the right wing brought most of Ghana’s attacking joy, most notably when he got in behind and crossed for captain Asamoah Gyan in the 70th minute, only for the former Sunderland striker to miss his kick. And it was Atsu who came closest to finding the net during the 90 minutes which occasionally promised much but eventually delivered little. The Everton winger struck the post with a lovely dipping shot that had beaten Boubacar Barry completely, but didn’t quite have enough bend to take it into the corner of the net. The Black stars hit the upright again not long after, Andre Ayew getting in behind the defence and wrong-footing Barry, only to see his shot go behind off the frame of the goal. Yaya Toure (centre) celebrates having won the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast, following a penalty shoot-out win over Ghana . Ivory Coast captain and Manchester star Yaya Toure is presented with the Africa Cup of Nations trophy on Sunday evening . Those near-misses aside, neither side looked much like breaking the deadlock. Neither Barry, playing for the first time in the tournament in the absence of the injured Sylvain Gbohouo, nor Brimah was forced to make too taxing a save, even as the game ticked into extra time. Asamoah Gyan missed his kick when well-placed, John Boye saw a header go just wide, and Jordan Ayew, off the bench to replace Cambridge United’s Kwesi Appiah, wasted a decent half chance for the Black Stars. The Elephants, for their part, were once again content to sit back and let Ghana have the majority of possession, playing much of their best football on the break.

Former Arsenal forward Gervinho attempts to keep possession for the favourites in the AFCON final against Ghana . Gervinho was a menace from the start, running at defenders with the mix of skilful play and uncontrolled chaos that has become his speciality. The former Arsenal man, as is his way, rarely had much in the way of end product, but he was always a threat for the Ghanain defence. He really should have scored in the second period of extra time, but took a poor touch when he was through on goal. The one time that that Gervinho did pick the perfect pass the opportunity was spurned by Max Gradel, the winger who once plied his trade for Leeds. Following a dreadful mistake from Baba Rahman, Gradel was played in on goal, only to blast over from 15 yards.

Ivory Coast and Manchester City talisman Yaya Toure drives forward under the attention of Ghana's midfielder Afriyie Acquah . It was the Ivorians’ best chance in a game noticeable more for the three red cards that didn’t happen than for anything that did. Asamoah Gyan was the first beneficiary, when he stamped on Eric Bailly off the ball, unspotted by referee Bakary Gassama. Gyan’s team-mate John Boye was equally lucky when he headbutted Eric Bailly in the second half, and Gassama again failed to notice. A referee can only give what he sees, however, so both Ghanaian incidents, though wrong, can be understood. How the official contrived to let Serey Die stay on the pitch, however, is another matter. There is no question he saw the kick to Wakaso Mubarak’s groin, which though not malicious was certainly painful for the Celtic man, and prompted a yellow card.

Ghana's midfielder Andre Ayew (right) challenges Ivory Coast's midfielder Serey Die as their sides vie for the AFCON 2015 title . He also awarded a free kick when the Ivorian midfield cynically chopped down Atsu to stop an attack, but inexplicably decided it was not worthy of a second yellow card. It was the closest we came to drama at Estadio de Bata until the shoot-out. But as the remnants of the Ivorian ‘golden generation’ now know, waiting a long time for success makes it all the sweeter.

"Fanatic: Zahoor Iqbal worked at Saltley School in Birmingham until his arrest in 2008 . A state school allegedly infiltrated by Muslim  fundamentalists had on its staff an extremist who was jailed for his involvement in a terror cell which planned to behead a British soldier, it emerged yesterday. Zahoor Iqbal, 36, was arrested while working for Saltley School, Birmingham, as an attendance officer and ‘achievement mentor’. Saltley is one of several schools allegedly targeted for takeover by Islamic fanatics. A leaked letter, seemingly from one plotter to another, has revealed an extraordinary operation in Birmingham to oust head teachers who did not comply with ‘Islamic principles’. Yesterday, it was also claimed that Saltley’s head, Bulwant Bains, was forced to quit by bullying governors when he opposed the introduction of halal-only school dinners. A teaching assistant, who worked at Saltley School for ten years, also told yesterday that terrorism convict Iqbal was just one of several extremists at the school. She said a group of male teachers and governors who called themselves The Brotherhood sought to make Saltley ‘an Islamic school’. The woman, who worked there until 2012, said: ‘Everyone was intimidated by The Brotherhood. They were the ones really running the school. They excluded moderate Muslims from their group and would talk in Urdu to each other and to the children. ‘More non-Muslims left every year until there were hardly any left. The Brotherhood would criticise anyone who wasn’t as strict as them. ‘I heard one Muslim teacher call another “a Bounty” because they were supposedly brown on the outside and white on the inside. Even how staff dressed was moderated to fit their beliefs.’ The source said she suspected Iqbal and other teachers took older pupils on ‘school trips’ to radicalise them. She said: ‘One teacher was suspended because he never kept records of where he was taking children. He would just take them away for weekends on his own.’ Iqbal was jailed for seven years in 2008 for supplying equipment for terrorist acts and supplying money or property for use in terrorism. Balwant Bains, former headmaster of Saltley School, said: 'I had to leave. I am trying to move away from a very horrible, horrible experience, and I am pleased that it has been exposed' Investigation: There have been allegations of faked resignation letters at Adderley Primary School in Birmingham, possibly connected to a reported Trojan Horse operation by Islamic fundamentalists . He was one of five men in a terrorist cell, led by Parviz Khan. Khan was outraged that Muslims were serving in the British Army and wanted to kidnap and behead one. Khan admitted the execution plot, although there was no suggestion that Iqbal was aware of it. Saltley’s head Mr Bains was ousted after opposing plans by governors to scrap sex education and allow only halal food. Friends said he faced  ‘bullying and intimidation’. The respected head, who is of Sikh origin, was also allegedly undermined when governors overturned his decision to expel a Muslim pupil found with a knife. The author of the leaked letter even admits targeting Mr Bains, writing: ‘At Saltley School we had a Sikh Head running a Muslim school. ‘This was perfect as we have been able to play the religion and India/Pakistan card and stirred up a real fuss about a Pakistani boy who had been excluded whilst an English boy had not.’ The undated letter, which is believed to have been written sometime last year, continues: ‘Balwant Bains will soon be sacked and we will move in. This is all about causing the maximum amount of organized (sic) chaos and we have fine tuned this as part of Trojan Horse.’ Birmingham City Council has launched an investigation which is being monitored by police and the Department for Education.","Zahoor Iqbal, 36, used to work at Saltley School in Birmingham .

"A successful researcher and science writer was asked to contribute to an obscure blog, but when she turned down the offer she was accused of being a 'whore.'

Offended: Lee's blog, called The Urban Scientist is focused on urban science outreach. As a black woman, she took particular offense to 'Ofek's' accusations and created a widely viewed online response . 'If you¿re a woman, a person of color, or from a lower socio-economic status, folks think they can get you, your talent, your expertise, and your energy for free,' said Lee. 'That¿s not available. So I hope you know that from now on.' 'I pimp game,' Lee said in her video response. 'I know how this works.' She was referring to the game of scientific research and blogging.

"Another hoard of lost masterpieces has been discovered in Austria by investigators looking into art looting by the Nazis. More than 180 masterpieces have been found in the latest raid, including a 1903 Monet oil painting of London’s Tower Bridge worth £8 million. The extraordinary collection also includes a bronze sculpture by Renoir and drawings by Gauguin, Cezanne and Picasso. Another hoard of lost masterpieces has been discovered in Austria by investigators looking into art looting by the Nazis. The works were allegedly recovered from a property belonging to the reclusive son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of Hitler's aides . The works were allegedly recovered from a property belonging to the reclusive son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of Hitler’s aides. Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, claimed he had inherited the collection from his father, who took orders from the dictator to buy and sell ‘degenerate art’ during the Second World War. He aroused suspicion in 2010 when German customs officials stopped him on a train from Switzerland carrying a large sum in cash. When authorities raided his Munich apartment in February 2012 on suspicion of tax evasion, they stumbled upon the vast art collection. Investigators were then led to another property owned by Mr Gurlitt in Salzburg, western Austria, where they discovered a further 60 paintings. An artwork by the German painter Franz Marc: At the end of the war 'Monuments Men' - the American army's art sleuths - quizzed Gurlitt's father on suspicion of criminal art dealing but he was never charged . Last week, a Vienna-based journalist revealed the existence of the third house linked to Mr Gurlitt, which is thought to have been used as a storage depot for the family collection. The large estate in the village of Bad Aussee, Styria, is home to Roman salt mines that were used to store some 6,000 artworks, which Hitler tried to destroy shortly before the war ended. It is estimated that less than half of the collection, recently featured in the George Clooney film The Monuments Men, was returned to the original owners. The total number of works recovered now stands at 238.","The extraordinary collection also includes a bronze sculpture by Renoir .

One of the drawings shows two female figures begging for help while another shows an asylum seeker in a cage as an Australian family look on. The common theme in most of the pictures is sad looking figures looking through bars at a world they have been dreaming of since leaving their home countries. A drawing taken by a child held in immigration detention expressing blood red tears . The drawing strongly expresses the two girls pleading for someone to help them to be released from the detention centre . The child's drawing depicts the contrast between living in a detention centre and the free life that Australians experience . These compelling images, which were used as part of the first stage of the Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into children in detention earlier in the year, have resurfaced as the federal government's medical health provider fronts the inquiry today. The commission's president Dr Gillian Triggs told the Sydney Morning Herald that the International Health and Medical Service had been widely criticised for the treatment of children living in detention centres across Australia and the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Dr Triggs gave the examples of the girl who could lose her eyesight because she wasn't given glasses for 11 months, and another child who was not given access to a specialist for a spinal deformity for six months. Meanwhile, the Federal Government is still refusing to confirm reports that two boats were intercepted by Australian authorities off Christmas Island on Saturday. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison insisted he would only confirm incidents that involve safety of life at sea. One of the boats is reportedly carrying 153 Tamil asylum seekers, including about 30 children - many of them sick - while the other has 50 people aboard. Prime Minister Tony Abbott says his government was determined to maintain its record of six months without an asylum seeker boat. 'I'm not going to comment on the operational detail of what happens on the water but obviously we have been successful up to now,' he said. 'It's more than six months since a successful people-smuggling venture made it to Australia and that's a record that the government is determined to maintain.' Write caption here .

"A radical shift in NHS policy will see hundreds of thousands more women encouraged to give birth at home. Mothers-to-be will be told that unless there is a high risk of complications they do not need a hospital delivery. First-time mothers are to be advised they are just as safe having their baby in a small midwife-led unit as on the labour ward. A radical shift in NHS policy will see hundreds of thousands more women encouraged to give birth at home . For most of those having their second child, giving birth at home is as safe as hospital – and far more pleasant – say new draft NHS guidelines revealed today. The encouragement for home births marks a major change in NHS guidance, which previously advised mothers to be ‘cautious’ about having their baby at home. NICE, the NHS watchdog, says its proposals reflect recent evidence. But the change of policy at a time when many hospital labour wards are struggling to cope with the highest birth rate in 40 years, will lead to concerns the NHS is simply trying to save money. Only last month, new president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Dr David Richmond warned that up to 300 babies a year are dying needlessly due to NHS staff shortages. Union leaders have repeatedly told ministers that the health service needs an extra 5,000 midwives to ensure proper standards of care. Currently, 94 per cent of the 730,000 women who go into labour in England and Wales each year give birth in hospital. Only 2.5 per cent give birth at home with the remainder going to midwife-run centres. Union leaders have repeatedly told ministers that the health service needs an extra 5,000 midwives . In the early 1900s nearly all women had babies at home but this fell rapidly after the creation of the NHS in 1948. Most women say they prefer to be in hospital to give birth in case anything goes wrong. But having a baby at home or in a midwife-led centre is far cheaper than having a hospital birth as women do not need a hospital bed. Staffing costs in midwifery units are also lower and they tend to rely less on pain relief or other interventions. Studies have shown a birth at home costs the NHS an average of £1,066, compared with £1,450 at midwife-led centres and £1,631 in hospital. Studies have shown a birth at home costs the NHS an average of £1,066, compared with £1,450 at midwife-led centres and £1,631 in hospital . Previously, NHS guidelines said mothers should be free to choose where they gave birth but urged caution over home births for women having their first child. Women will now be advised to give birth outside hospital as long as their pregnancy is considered low risk and they do not suffer from asthma, diabetes, epilepsy or other chronic health conditions. The draft guidelines say: ‘Midwives should explain to the mother-to-be that she may choose any birth setting... and support her in her choice. ‘Midwives should advise low-risk women who have already had at least one child to plan to give birth either at home or in a midwife-led unit. ‘Midwives should advise low risk women who are expecting their first baby to plan to give birth in a midwife-led unit. This is because women tend to have a better experience in this setting than a traditional labour ward.’ Midwife-led units aim to create a more homely environment and there are typically between four and ten beds and water-birth facilities. They are either stand-alone centres in the community or attached to hospitals. Doctors are summoned only in an emergency. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said women had too often been denied a choice of where to give birth. This should be at the heart of maternity strategy, she said. A spokesman from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said: ‘We support choice for low-risk women who have had successful previous births to give birth at home provided transport arrangements are in place for hospital transfer in the event of an emergency or should there be a request for pain relief.’","First-time mothers 'just as safe having baby in a small midwife-led unit'

"Researchers found that susceptibility to bowel cancer was strongly influenced both by iron and a gene called APC . Scientists claim high levels of iron may be one reason why eating red meat raises the risk of bowel cancer. Iron may switch on the disease process via a faulty gene in the gut which would normally resist the disease. Red meat contains large amounts of iron and is also known to increase the likelihood of bowel cancer. The discovery could lead to new treatments that can ‘mop up’ iron in the bowel in people who develop cells affected by the defective gene. In studies of mice, researchers found that susceptibility to bowel cancer was strongly influenced both by iron and a gene called APC. When the APC gene was faulty, mice with a high iron intake were two to three times more likely to develop the disease. Mice fed a low iron diet remained cancer free even if the gene was defective, but when it functioned normally, high iron levels did no harm. Lead scientist Professor Owen Sansom, deputy director of the Cancer Research UK Institute in Glasgow, said ‘We’ve made a huge step in understanding how bowel cancer develops. ‘The APC gene is faulty in around eight out of 10 bowel cancers but until now we haven’t known how this causes the disease. ‘It’s clear that iron is playing a critical role in controlling the development of bowel cancer in people with a faulty APC gene. ‘And, intriguingly, our study shows that even very high levels of iron in the diet don’t cause cancer by itself, but rely on the APC gene.’ Each year, more than 41,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer and around 16,000 die from the disease. Previously, researchers have estimated that red meat contributes to around 17,000 cases of bowel cancer a year. But this estimate was based on two different dietary factors thought to play a part in promoting bowel cancer because a substance called haem, which gives red meat its colour, can damage the lining of the colon, while burning meat produces cancer-causing compounds. The latest laboratory study proposes another mechanism that, if confirmed in people, might help explain why people’s risk of bowel cancer increases with age. Over time, cells in the bowel would be increasingly likely to develop APC gene faults and thus react to iron in the diet. Researchers say that when the APC gene doesn’t work, iron is allowed to build up in the cells lining the gut. This activates a genetic cancer ‘switch’ called wnt that causes cells to multiply out of control. But consumption of iron also aids the growth of cells with defective APC over time, says the study published in the journal Cell reports. In mice fed a diet with no iron, cells with a faulty APC gene were killed off and bowel cancer did not develop. Mice with a fully functioning APC gene did not grow tumours even when fed high amounts of iron in their diet. In these animals, the wnt signalling pathway remained switched ‘off’. Co-author Dr Chris Tselepis, a Cancer Research UK scientist at the University of Birmingham, said ‘Our results also suggest that iron could be raising the risk of bowel cancer by increasing the number of cells in the bowel with APC faults. ‘The more of these cells in the bowel, the greater the chance that one of these will become a starting point for cancer. ‘We’re now planning to develop treatments that reduce the amount of iron in the bowel and so could lower the risk of developing bowel cancer. ‘We hope to start using these in trials in the next few years in people who are at a greater risk.’ Dr Julie Sharp, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said ‘Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK. ‘These findings suggest a potentially effective way of reducing the chances of bowel cancer developing in people who are at high risk. ‘Finding ways of ‘mopping up’ the iron that is in the bowel could have a real impact on the number of people who develop the disease.’","Scientists found when a gene called APC doesn’t work, it allows a build up of iron in the cells lining the gut ."
"What started out as a heart-warming tale about the kindness of strangers and the love of a man and his dog, has turned into a war of words and impending lawsuit. Dave Thomas, from San Bernardino, California, had his impounded dog returned to him due to the actions of shelter photographer Maria Sanchez - who posted a heartbreaking picture of the separated pair on Facebook in a bid to raise money to have the dog released. Donations flooded in and Thomas was reunited with Buzz Lightyear earlier this week. But now, he has allegedly repaid the favor by threatening to sue Sanchez for embezzlement, slander and grand larceny. Scroll down for video . Best of friends: Dave Thomas, from San Bernardino, couldn't afford to have his impounded dog Buzz Lightyear released so sat and held his beloved pet's paw . Emotion: Mr Thomas, 36, was helped out by Good Samaritans including Maria Sanchez (left) who he has repaid by threatening to sue her . By your side: Mr Thomas sat alongside his pet Buzz Lightyear but was not allowed to have his dog back because he could not pay $400 fees at the pound . Thomas was jailed for a few days for traffic violations on February 13 - leading to Buzz Lightyear being impounded. When he was released from prison, he could not afford the $400 fees to have the two-year-old pit bull mix released from its cage at the shelter. When he visited his pooch, he weeped as he fed Buzz Lightyear water and Cheetos, and stroked his paw through the cage. When Ms Sanchez saw the exchange, she took pictures and posted them on Facebook. Not only was the $400 for the release fee raised, but an extra $1,600 on top. Because Thomas, 36, did not leave his details at the pound, Ms Sanchez went out of her way to find him, posting fliers all over the local area and appealing for help online. She finally tracked him down on Monday evening and a highly emotional and relieved Mr Thomas was reunited with his beloved Buzz the following day. Now, however, Thomas has threatened to sue Sanchez for not handing over the rest of the cash left over from the donations after the shelter fee was covered. In a voice mail allegedly left by Thomas, he tells her: 'You are dead wrong and I will be getting in touch with the lawyer and if . you do anything with my money that is slander one, embezzlement . two…what’s the other one? Oh grand larceny because it’s over $1,000.' Ms Sanchez posted the phone call on YouTube and defended herself. Despair: Mr Thomas, 36, didn't have the funds to release his dog before he was pictured by a Good Samaritan animal lover . Overwhelmed: It took days to track down Mr Thomas who was extremely emotional when he realized that strangers had donated to have him reunited with his dog . She wrote: 'Dave has called to inform . them that I am keeping the money raised for his dog. I have transferred . $842.07 into my bank to reimburse myself for the shelter fees, vet and . PetSmart shopping spree that I put onto my personal credit card. 'I had a discussion regarding the remainder of the donations and how he would like to spend them. I . asked if he had any bills that were due at the time. I told him that . every dime that was donated would go to him and Buzz, but that I would . not be giving him the cash. 'I explained to him that the money . that was donated was a blessing for him, I wanted to be sure that we . respected that and used the donations responsibly. He sat next to me and . nodded his head, Not one response, question or concern.' She then revealed she was going to return the money to those who donated or else give it to an animal shelter. 'I have been reimbursed for all . expense to rescue Buzz from the high kill San Bernardino City Shelter . and reunite him with his owner Dave Thomas,' she added. 'There are donations leftover. The . donations will NOT go to Dave after the stunt he has pulled. If you . still want Dave to have your donation, I will have to ask you to send it . to him personally.

"Thania Sayne was pregnant with her second child when her husband, a sergeant in the U.S. Army, was killed in Afghanistan. The Effingham, Illinois, mother wept at her husband's grave on Wednesday, the day before what would have been the couple's third wedding anniversary. Two years after Sergeant Timothy Sayne . was buried at Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, his widow has revealed she . still doesn't know how to tell her young son that his father will never . be coming home. Grieving: Thania weeps at the grave of her husband, Sergeant Timothy Sayne, who was killed in Afghanistan . Mrs Sayne gave birth to the couple's second son, Douglas, a few months after her 31-year-old husband was killed in a bomb attack in Afghanistan's Kandahar province on September 18, 2011. 'It was really hard. There’s no words to explain what it was like not having him next to me,' she told the Effingham Daily News a few months after her husband's death. Killed in action: Sergeant Sayne died in a bomb attack in Afghanistan . She said yesterday that she still doesn't know how to tell her little boy, who will turn two in January, that his father was killed in action. But she is keen to keep her husband's memory alive, saying that despite her overwhelming grief she is proud of what he did for his country. 'He always wanted to serve his country and protect us, and for that I am proud, but I’m also angry because he’s not here,' she said. The widow said that although visiting her husband's graveside is emotional, she finds solace from the other families at the cemetery. 'There was a comfort in knowing I’m not the only one this happened to. There’s other single moms and kids without daddies and other wives without husbands and other moms without sons,' she said. She added that Sergeant Sayne had requested to be buried at Arlington after showing his wife old movies of fallen heroes being carried to the cemetery by horse-drawn hearses. Mrs Sayne's latest visit to Arlington coincided with the national cemetery easing restrictions it had recently imposed on mementos being left on soldiers' graves. A spokesman for the cemetery said small mementos and photographs will now be allowed to be left in memory of fallen servicemen and women. Staff at the graveyard had recently cleared personal tributes from headstones, saying they weren't in keeping with the cemetery's policies. But, after grieving relatives who have lost loved ones in recent conflicts complained, Arlington announced it would ease its rules.

"They were the club who openly neglected the cup competitions with a manager embarrassed by his record. Now, however, Newcastle United and Alan Pardew are two ties from Wembley and are going all out for their first domestic trophy in 60 years. It was during a fans’ forum meeting last season that club hierarchy upset supporters when they admitted that the FA Cup and League Cup were not a priority. Alan Pardew vows to pick a strong team to face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup quarters on Wednesday . Newcastle are looking to bounce back after a 4-1 defeat by Arsenal on Saturday after their win over Chelsea . Indeed, before this campaign Pardew had never made it beyond the fourth round of either competition, a failure he conceded was ‘embarrassing’. On Wednesday night, they face Spurs at White Hart Lane in the Capital One Cup quarter-final with debate on Tyneside raging over which match – this or Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby – takes precedence. That the majority of supporters have sided with the chance of a first Wembley appearance since 2000 and first piece of domestic silverware since the FA Cup in 1955 and their first trophy since the 1969 Inter-City Fairs Cup, serves to highlight the significance of the trip to north London. And that is not lost on Pardew. ‘It's about grasping this opportunity,’ said the former Crystal Palace midfielder, who was an FA Cup finalist in 1990. ‘I have played in quarter-finals before and there is just extra meaning to it. You just sense it. You are close. You are eight teams away. ‘It's like going to the funfair, I guess. When you are young, you are really looking forward to it because it's going to be exciting and that's the sense you get – and there's where we are. Rookie keeper Jack Alnwick is set to keep his spot with Tim Krul and Rob Elliott still injured . ‘I can feel the squad bubbling under in terms of the excitement and looking forward to the two games.’ He added: ‘Look, the derby is a Premier League game and an important one. We are all aware of that. It carries more significance in this area, and maybe in the football world because of the fixture's history. ‘But a quarter-final of the League Cup doesn't come around too often for this club and there is a spring in the step.’ Pardew’s record in the FA Cup, in particular, has been a source of shame. Newcastle have lost to Stevenage, Brighton (twice) and Cardiff during his four-year tenure. Progression tonight, however, could represent payback to supporters who were so disgusted when a weakened team were beaten by Cardiff in January. To that end, Pardew will be naming his strongest XI. ‘This run has eased the embarrassment a little bit,’ he said. ‘I don't think it will take away the pain of Brighton and Stevenage, and the Cardiff game which we should have won. That was such a disappointment and we carried that for a little while in our mood and personality. ‘I just hope that whatever happens that we put a performance on for our 4,000 fans. There are not many clubs who would go to Arsenal (on Saturday), come all the way back up, have a rest and then go back down to London again. Newcastle captain Jimmy Schoular is raised above boss Duggie Livingstone with the FA Cup in 1955 . The 1955 FA Cup, brought home to Newcastle here, is the last time the club won domestic silverware . ‘I appreciate that and their support is important.’ He went on: ‘We will be very strong (in terms of selection). ‘It's an exciting few days for us, and this is what we are in football for. We have got ourselves here. We have now got this moment, so let's grasp it. Hopefully this team can. ‘I think this team may be more geared up for football than past ones, so that helps, but we have also played very well and the cup competition has been key to the turn-around in our season. ‘If we win this, we have got all the momentum we need going into the derby. It can work in our favour.’","Newcastle face Tottenham in Capital One Cup quarter-final on Wednesday .

"At least 10 people have been injured by piranhas in the same Argentine river where a similar attack by the carnivorous fish occurred last month. The vicious creatures, known as palometas, have been attacking bathers since Thursday at the Parana River in Rosario, which is 186 miles north-east of Buenos Aires. Seventy people were bitten by the shoal of meat-eating fish in late December as they attempted to cool off from the unusually high summer temperatures. Vicious: A shoal of sharp-toothed palometas have been blamed for recent attacks on swimmers in Argentina . During that attack, a seven-year-old girl lost part of a finger, while other swimmers suffered deep cuts to their ankles, fingers and hands. Palometas have been described as 'a type of piranha, big, voracious and with sharp teeth that can really bite.' They have been known to target humans in Rosario before, with 40 swimmers hurt during a mass-attack in 2008. Media reports said the latest injuries include a boy who suffered a foot wound while floating in the river. Experts say a combination of hot weather and lower numbers of species such as caiman, which prey on the fish, could be causing the attacks. Fatalities are however rare, with the majority of attacks occurring as nips and bites to the extremities, such as hands and feet. Injured: A man is treated following the attack in December . Attack victim: This man sustained a bite on his foot following the vicious fish attack in the Parana River in December . Under attack: The Parana river in Rosario, where the fish have been attacking swimmers since December . On alert: The city of Rosario in Argentina, which has been subject to attacks by the piranha-like fish . Ready to bite: Piranhas have strong teeth and jaws . Piranhas are omnivorous freshwater fish native to South American rivers, but they have also been spotted in Bangladesh and China. They are known for their sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for meat. The exact number of piranha species is unknown, as new species continue to be discovered, but estimates range from 30 to 60. Piranhas are normally 14cm to 26cm long, though some have been reported up to 43cm in length. Attacks in the Amazon basin have been on the increase in recent years. In 2011, a drunk 18-year-old man was attacked and killed in Rosario del Yata, Bolivia. In 2012, a five-year-old Brazilian girl was attacked and killed by a shoal of piranhas, while recurring attacks in Piaui in 2011 resulted in 100 people being injured. Piranha attacks peak in the dry season when there is less food and the water levels are lower. Fatalities are rare, with the majority of attacks taking the form of bites to the feet and hands. Splashing tends to make piranhas more likely to attack, explaining why children are often injured during mass attacks of these creatures.","Attack occurred in same Argentine river where 70 were injured last month .

"The benefits of the annual flu jab have been ‘over-hyped’, scientists claim. They say the vaccine is far less effective than is widely believed, with some studies showing it protects less than two-thirds of the population. The US researchers say ministers  in Britain as well as America are ‘wasting taxpayers’ money’ on the jab. And they claim that because the benefits have been so ‘over-promoted’, scientists have been deterred from inventing vaccines that would be far more effective. Flu jabs are a waste of taxpayer's money due to the protective effects of the vaccine being over-hyped, it has been claimed . Is the flu jab a waste of taxpayers' money? Is the flu jab a waste of taxpayers' money? Now share your opinion . But the Department of Health has . insisted the flu jabs ‘save lives’ and urged the elderly and patients . with long-term conditions to come forward for their vaccinations. Researchers from the University of . Minnesota looked at 12,000 studies on the effectiveness and safety of . the flu jab, going back to the 1930s. They say that although Government . officials claim it protects between 70 and 90 per cent of the . population, this is actually not the case. In fact, they say, it protects just 59 per cent of adults aged 18 to 65, but is far less effective in the elderly. Professor Michael Osterholm, who was . involved in the study, said: ‘I have been a strong proponent of . vaccination in general, and flu vaccine in particular, for many years. I . still recommend its use as the best we have. The report's author, Professor Michael Osterholm, said he still recommended the vaccine, but its benefits were over-reported . ‘But we have over-promoted this . vaccine. For certain age groups in some years its effectiveness has been . severely limited relative to what has been previously reported. ‘That has had a very dampening effect . on the development of new vaccines.’ And Douglas Fleming, of the Royal . College of General Practitioners’ Influenza Monitoring Unit in . Birmingham, said: ‘No vaccines are perfect. Last year’s flu vaccine was a . bad match with the circulating strains. Its effectiveness varies from . year to year and with different age groups. ‘Among the elderly it is widely . recognised that its effectiveness decreases. Better vaccines are needed . for this reason particularly. It has been over-hyped by many people.’ At present the flu jab is offered . free to the over-65s, pregnant women and anyone with an underlying . health condition such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy. The immunisation programme is  estimated to cost the taxpayer £115million a year. The latest figures from the Health . Protection Agency show that 61 per cent of the over-65s have been . vaccinated this year, as well as 30 per cent of pregnant women and 37.5 . per cent of those with long-term conditions. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘There is no doubt that the flu programme saves lives. ‘Evidence on the effectiveness of the . vaccine is reviewed by the Joint Committee of Vaccination and . Immunisation and this year the committee undertook a detailed review of . the flu vaccine programme. ‘We strongly encourage scientists and . the vaccine industry in their efforts to develop new and more effective . flu vaccine and do not agree that these efforts are being discouraged. ‘Each year thousands of people die after catching flu and we urge everyone that is in an at-risk group to get the vaccine.’ Professor Osterholm added: ‘We . support using flu vaccine in all age groups.

"BP and Shell are being investigated over allegations that they have fixed petrol prices for more than a decade. European Commission investigators raided the offices of several major oil companies yesterday as they launched a far-reaching probe into price manipulation. They fear prices have been driven up at the pumps for millions of motorists. The AA responded to news of the swoop by declaring: ‘The lid is about to be blown off.’ The European Commission fears prices at the pumps may have been driven up for millions of motorists . Shell confirmed it was one of several companies in three countries being investigated . The commission said it suspected firms had ‘colluded in reporting distorted prices’ to agencies that publish the data used to set the price of oil and petrol. Tory MP Robert Halfon, a long-time campaigner against high petrol prices, said: ‘These latest allegations underline why action is required urgently in the UK. High oil prices are crushing families across Britain. Motorists are being taken for a very expensive ride.’ Oil companies ‘must come clean and show some responsibility for what is happening to the international oil price’, he added. Motoring organisations, who have complained about a lack of transparency in the way oil prices are set, welcomed the probe. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ‘The AA has been warning since 2005 about the activity of speculation in oil and fuel markets.’ The investigation is reminiscent of the Libor scandal, in which bankers were found to have manipulated interest rates. But while City pundits believe Libor-rigging had little impact on ordinary people, the European Commission said oil price fixing may have hit motorists in the pocket directly. It warned that even small distortions could have ‘a huge impact on the prices of crude oil . . . potentially harming final consumers’. Brian Madderson, of the Petrol Retailers’ Association (PRA), criticised the UK’s Office of Fair Trading, saying it had failed to take action after his organisation submitted a complaint in January 2012. He said the PRA raised concerns earlier this year about an 8p increase in wholesale prices between December and February that ‘could not be explained by new geo-political issues or other economic factors’. BP and Shell admitted they were among several companies in three countries being investigated. BP, whose offices in Canary Wharf were raided yesterday morning, said it was ‘co-operating fully with the investigation and unable to comment further at this time’. BP said it is 'co-operating fully' with the European Commission after its Canary Wharf offices were raided . Norwegian state oil firm Statoil is also . under investigation. It said that ‘suspected violations . . . may have . been going on since 2002’. The probe relates to the process used by price reporting agency Platts, which publishes prices for crude oil, petroleum products and financial instruments linked to oil. Platts’ so-called Market On Close (MOC) method works by asking oil traders – some of whom work for major firms such as BP and Shell – to submit the prices they pay to buy and sell oil and other products. The agency assesses traders’ submissions during a ‘window’ of time, relying on the data to publish prices at the end of each day. Those prices are used as a reference point, affecting the wholesale price that petrol retailers pay – about 47p a litre at the moment. That cost is then passed on to motorists, who currently pay an average of £1.33 for a litre of unleaded – nearly double the 71p it cost in 2002. A spokesman said: ‘Platts is co-operating fully with the European Commission’s review.’ The commission said it was looking not only at false reporting of price information, but also at concerns that companies ‘may have prevented others from participating in the price assessment process, with a view to distorting published prices’.","European Commission launched inquiry into price manipulation .

"The state pension is a ‘right’ earned over a lifetime and not a benefit, a minister has said. Pensions minister Steve Webb said the elderly were driven ‘up the wall’ by politicians lumping the weekly payment with other welfare payments. Mr Webb said the government was going to stop referring to the state pension, worth £113 a week, as a benefit because of the stigma attached to claiming welfare. Pensions minister Steve Webb said it was 'shocking' to lump the state pension in with other benefits . Labour has previously suggested that the state pension could be included in a future welfare cap after the election. But Mr Webb said that defining it as a benefit in that way would be ‘shocking’. He said: ‘Labour want to put it in the welfare cap, which is shocking really. If you have an over-spend on [one benefit], then you might cut the state pension to make up the shortfall. ‘That completely undermines what the state pension is. To include it in the welfare cap would be quite wrong.’ The Lib Dem minister told The Telegraph: ‘The law refers to the state pension as a benefit and has done since the war. ‘As our research shows, it drives pensioners up the wall if you talk about claiming a benefit rather than the state pension. ‘Absolutely rightly, it is yours by right, you have paid your national insurance contributions. There's a certain amount of stigma about claiming benefits, when people draw their state pension that's not how they think of it.’ The Government's annual 'benefits' bill is dominated by state pension payments, which accounts for more than £1 in every £2 spent on welfare . The Department for Work and Pensions has accepted that it needs to consider the ‘tone and wording’ it uses when discussing the state pension. The state pension is something that elderly people feel that they have ‘built up entitlement to’ by working, the Government has said.","Steve Webb said pensioners were driven 'up the wall' by comparison .

"Sheffield Wednesday are interested in former Chelsea forward Filipe Morais. The 29-year-old, who currently plays for Bradford City, is attracting interest from a host of Championship sides following a string of impressive displays for the Bantams. Morais signed a short-term deal with Bradford in the summer - but the contract is due to expire next month. Bradford City forward Filipe Morais celebrates after scoring against Dartford in the FA Cup second round . And his contract situation has alerted Wednesday and Championship rivals Bolton to his availability. Bradford manager Phil Parkinson is hopeful of keeping Morais, but could face an uphill battle should those higher in the English football pyramid solidify their interest. Morais played in Jose Mourinho's first-ever match as Chelsea manager in a pre-season friendly against Oxford in 2004. Bradford manager Phil Parkinson (above) is hopeful of holding onto his in-form forward Morais . He signed his first professional deal in 2005, but never made a senior appearance for the Blues before rejecting another 12 month deal ahead of leaving for Millwall in 2006. 'It's incredibly hard, almost impossible, for youngsters to break through at Chelsea,' he said in 2007. 'There was the offer of another year, but I knew it was time to move on.

"The Great British people are wrong about almost everything, a new poll reveals today. From religion to age, jobs to pregnancy, what people think about the country and the reality are wildly different. A new survey by IpsosMORI shows the public think immigration, teenage pregnancies and unemployment are all much higher than reality, while they underestimate the number of Christians in the UK and turnout at elections. Scroll down for video . The pollster's global survey looks at key issues facing 14 countries and whether the public perception is matched by the facts. It concludes: 'In Great Britain we get a lot of things very wrong.' For example, people think that as many as one in six (16 per cent) teenage girls aged 15-19 give birth each year, when the true figure is just 3 per cent. People also think we will live longer than reality suggests, expecting a baby born in 2014 to live to 83, when official forecasts predict only 80. Repeated warnings about an ageing population have led us to think that 37 per cent of people are aged 65 or over, when the true figure is less than half: just 17 per cent. Immigration has become the dominat political theme, with David Cameron josliting with other party leaders to show he has the toughest approach. But the problem might not be as serious as some think. Britons believe that almost a quarter – some 24 per cent - of the population are immigrants – which is almost double twice the true figure of 13 per cent, the poll found. The social make-up of the UK is also different to the public perception. For example, we 'hugely over-estimate' the proportion of Muslims in Britain, believing one in five British people are Muslims (21 per cent) when the actual figure is 5 per cent (one in twenty), Ipsos Mori said. At the same time we underestimate the proportion of Christians, believing that 39 per cent of the country identify themselves as Christian compared with the true figure of 59 per cent. Unemployment has fallen dramatically in recent months to just 7 per cent, with record numbers of people now in work. But the public still thinks that 24 per cent of the working age population do not have a job. And on elections, on average people think just 49 per cent turned out for the 2010 general election, when turnout was actually much higher at 66 per cent. Bobby Duffy, Managing Director of Ipsos MORI Social Research Institute, said: 'These misperceptions present clear issues for informed public debate and policy-making. For example, public priorities may well be different if we had a clearer view of the scale of immigration and the real incidence of teenage mothers. 'People also under-estimate 'positive' behaviours like voting, which may be important if people think it is more 'normal' not to vote than it actually is. 'This is the first international study to look at these misperceptions across a range of issues and countries – and it shows the British are far from alone in being wrong. 'In fact we're among the better informed countries – but there are still huge gaps between perceptions and reality on a number of key issues in Britain.'","New poll reveals the vast gap between what the public think and reality .

"Everton are nervously awaiting results of tests that could leave Kevin Mirallas and Leon Osman facing lengthy absences. Mirallas had tests on Tuesday after he was carried off during Monday’s 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers with ankle ligament damage.

Osman’s situation is also causing concern for Martinez, ahead of Saturday’s trip to Southampton. He has not played since coming off the bench against Manchester City on December 6 and has had his ankle in a protective boot. The former England midfielder was due to see a specialist for further tests and the fear is that he will require an operation. Martinez’s options in midfield have been hit in recent weeks with James McCarthy recovering from a hamstring problem and Darron Gibson also injured. Gareth Barry, meanwhile, was suspended against QPR having been booked five times. Mirallas scores Everton's second goal with a heavily deflected free-kick in the fist-half . Ross Barkley opened the scoring with a wonder goal on his return to the starting line-up . That meant Martinez had to use Ross Barkley in central midfield alongside Muhamed Besic, having previously said the England international was not ready for the responsibility of that position. Despite Barkley capping his most complete display of the season with a superb goal, team-mate Steven Naismith has urged caution when considering his progress. ‘Ross and Mo did fantastically well,’ he said. ‘Ross is a terrific talent with a lot going for him but he has a lot to learn.’ Barkley wheels away to celebrate his blistering strike, which left manager Roberto Martinez purring .

"A Good Samaritan who stopped to help Clarke Carlisle after he jumped in front of a lorry has been left so traumatised that he has been forced to quit his job. Chris Kilbride was driving along the A64 near York on his way to work when the former footballer launched himself into the path of an oncoming lorry in a bid to take his own life. The 24-year-old was forced to swerve to avoid the sports star, as he lay fighting for his life in the middle of the road. He then rushed to his side and phoned 999. Scroll down for video . Chris Kilbride, 24, (left) has revealed how he stopped to help Clarke Carlisle (right) after he attempted to end his life by jumping in front of a lorry on the A64 near York in December . But the father-of-two revealed today how the terrifying incident has left him in a 'dark place', which includes flashbacks and nightmares. He says he is so disturbed about what happened that he cannot drive past the same spot, meaning he has had to give up his work. He also told how he made a promise - while tending to Carlisle - to try and meet him, should he ever pulled through from the horrific crash. At the time, he did not know who the man. He told the Sunday People: 'I can't believe he ­survived. I expected him to pass away. 'I said to myself, ""If he survives I would like to meet the man"". I don't have any hatred towards him. He did what he did because he was in a bad place. 'But the consequences of his actions have now put me in a similar place. I'm not angry at him. 'Everyone deals with things differently. But because he did that, I've now got to deal with it.' Carlisle, the former Leeds, Burnley and QPR defender, bravely revealed earlier this year how he jumped in front of the lorry in December in a failed suicide attempt. Carlisle was recently released from hospital. six weeks after he was injured in the collision with a lorry . The 35-year-old former footballer played for QPR (left) and Burnley (right) during his playing days . The 35-year-old had previously spoken about how he had struggled with mounting depression and a sense of worthlessness after he retired from professional sport in 2013. He attempted to build a career as a pundit but lost a £100,000 role with ITV. He was then arrested for drink-driving just 36 hours before his suicide attempt. Carlisle was critically injured during the collision and was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary. He finally returned home from hospital earlier this year, after suffering internal bleeding, a broken rib and cuts and bruises. Today, Mr Kilbride described how he rushed to Carlisle's side as he lay in the middle of the road, in a pool of blood. Clarke Carlisle's wife Gemma has spoken of her horror at witnessing the former footballer's injuries after he jumped in front of a lorry. The pair are pictured together in 2013 . The former footballer attempted to build a career as a pundit but lost a £100,000 role with ITV. He was then arrested for drink-driving just 36 hours before his suicide attempt . He told how instinct kicked in and that he immediately leapt out of his car to phone an ambulance. He described how Carlisle was so still that he believed he was was dead. But he then saw Carlisle's arm move and realised he was conscious. Another passer-by then stopped to help and Mr Kilbride continued talking to the call handler. When the police arrived, he says he went to comfort the lorry driver, who was 'hysterical' and also had glass in his eye. A few hours later, he received a voicemail from the lorry driver's wife, thanking him for comforting her husband. Meanwhile, the footballer's wife Gemma Carlisle had previously told how she begged her husband not to die as he lay disfigured in a hospital bed because she was 'too young to be a widow'. Brave: The former Leeds, Burnley and QPR defender has spoken about his depression in the past . He suffered internal bleeding, a broken rib and cuts and bruises following the incident in December . Recalling her first visit to see him in hospital, she said: 'Nothing could prepare me for what I saw. There was so much blood. It was everywhere. 'I went to hold his hand but his hands and his arms had bits hanging off. I remember saying to him ""don’t you dare die, please get better, please live"". I thought I'm too young to be a widow.' She told how she had Carlisle missing two days before the collision and tried desperately to contact him through his mobile but had only managed to reach the answer phone every time. When officers knocked on her door to reveal he had been found, she was taken in a police car to hospital and could see the helicopter that was carrying her husband. Earlier this week, Twitter users had leapt to Carlisle's defence  after actor Ralf Little accused his former friend of not telling the 'full story'. The Royle Family star was branded 'crass' and 'insensitive' for tweeting that Carlisle was going to 'get away with it again' in reference to his interview about his battle with depression. The actor had earlier tweeted a picture of the article, commenting: 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN. #Teflon #nonstick.' He also wrote: 'Seems people want context about previous tweet. So let me say, I know the full story and it's not what's portrayed in the media. That's all.' The pair had become friends in the early 2000s, but are thought to have fallen out when Carlisle took the actor's bank card to fill Little's car with petrol. Instead, according to Carlisle's autobiography, he used the card to fund a drinking spree. Little did not refer to the incident, thought to have taken place in 2003, but admitted he should not have used a forum such as Twitter to make the comment.

"More than 26,000 suspected criminals, including alleged rapists and paedophiles, have gone on the run after being bailed in the past three years, figures show. A member of the Prison Officers' Association said the figures were shocking and indicated overcrowding in jails is leading to people being granted bail due to lack of space. The information from the Metropolitan Police showed 26,312 suspects who had disappeared after being released on bail, and covers the London area only. Fugitive terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed was on bail when he escaped by dressing in a burka . Portuguese child rapist Antonio Pedro De Alves went on the run last month after he was given bail and allowed to keep his passport while awaiting trial . Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association said prison closures and staff cuts have put pressure on the system. He told the Mirror: ‘People appear to be getting granted bail to cope with the lack of space inside our prisons. That isn't right.’ A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘The figures include Crown Court bench warrants, failure to appear magistrates' warrants, breaches of court orders and orders by other prosecuting agencies that are not issued by the Metropolitan Police Service.' The spokesman added: ‘The figures also include those individuals who have subsequently been arrested. ‘The MPS recognises that pre-charge bail decisions impact on victims, witnesses and suspects. ‘We are committed to maximising every investigative opportunity to bring offenders to justice swiftly and we aim to finalise investigations wherever possible during the first period of detention. ‘The MPS is committed to finding people who fail to attend court or attempt to evade justice. We will not give up in the search and we will use every means available to find them. Active operations are in place to find wanted suspects and bring them back before the courts.’ Fugitive drug trafficker Mark Lilley (pictured left, being caught last year and right after being arrested in 1995) went on the run in 2000 when he skipped bail during a trial and was only caught last year hiding out in Spain . Yesterday it was revealed that 77 prisoners have escaped from British jails in the last 10 years without being recaptured. International drugs traffickers and firearms owners sentenced to life are also among the absconded prisoners who escaped between April 2004 and March 2014 and remain unlawfully at large, the Ministry of Justice data showed.

He's a tax exile.' Barton continued: 'Tax exile's should be exempt from winning trophies paid and voted for by the tax/licence payer. He should never have won.

I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here as well.

"Lewis Thelwall, 19, who killed himself after being bullied on Facebook - the coroner warned of the dangers of online bullying . Two young women have been cautioned by police after a young man who was being bullied online hanged himself. At the inquest into the death of 19-year-old Lewis Thelwall, who committed suicide after false rumours about him were put on Facebook, a coroner warned users of social networking sites to 'think of the consequences'. Philip Rogers, coroner for Neath and Port Talbot, said the two women had written 'malicious and completely unfounded' posts about 'colourful' Mr Thelwall on the site. The inquest into the death of the budding photographer from Port Talbot who was known for dyeing his hair bright colours heard how he was targeted by others who posted false rumours about him online. Police studied his Facebook messages to discover 'malicious and completely unfounded' allegations against Mr Thelwall, the inquest heard. Detective Constable Lee Stephens, of South Wales police, described Mr Thelwall as a 'happy-go-lucky character' who was upset at Facebook slurs. He said he interviewed several young people after Mr Thelwall's death and investigated the Facebook comments before cautioning two young women, who can't be identified for legal reasons, for malicious communication. Det Con Stephens said: 'The two have apologised for their actions.' The coroner said there was a 'long and complicated' story involving Facebook messages which he could 'only describe as Facebook bullying'. He added: 'I would urge anyone who uses this sort of social media to think of the consequences.' Mr Rogers said comments made online caused Mr Thelwall, who was originally from Swindon but moved to Wales when he was nine, great distress.  He said the effect was exacerbated because Mr Thelwall was vulnerable after the death of his father. 'Vulnerable': The inquest into Mr Thelwall's death heard how he was upset by his father's death . The coroner said: 'Two young women known to Lewis have taken it upon themselves to make entries on Facebook which they now accept as malicious and completely unfounded. 'Sadly he was a young man who was vulnerable because of the death of his father. 'The two young women have accepted their responsibility for these messages.  They accepted they had little idea of what affect it would have on Lewis.' Mr Rogers said he was satisfied that Mr Thelwall, who was studying forensics and photography when he died on 26 November last year, hanged himself and recorded a verdict of suicide. Mr Thelwall's mother Tina Thelwall also warned against online bullying, saying: 'Be careful what you write. 'Behind closed doors you don’t know what is going on. They did not understand what Lewis was going through.' Reverend Matthew Trick of St Paul's church in Aberavon, which Mr Thelwall's family attended, said the young man was 'thought of very highly'. He said: 'He fell in love with photography and was inseparable from his camera.' More than 200 people joined the RIP Lewis Facebook group set up in Mr Thelwall's memory, and described him as 'charming', 'cheeky', 'warm-hearted' and 'fun'.

"The report's authors found the elderly - as well as patients with cancer and heart problems who are more at risk of complications - have been 'seriously underprioritised' and 'forgotten' by the NHS . Tens of thousands of patients are dying needlessly after routine operations because they are not being properly looked after in hospitals, leading surgeons warn. They are left 'languishing' on wards run by junior doctors rather than being moved to specialised units tended to by teams of consultants and nurses. The Royal College of Surgeons warns that care is so poor that these patients are four times more likely to die in British hospitals compared to the U.S. They say the elderly – as well as patients with cancer and heart problems who are more at risk of complications – have been 'seriously underprioritised' and 'forgotten' by the NHS. The report looked at more than 50 existing studies into care of these high-risk patients in NHS hospitals who had undergone common operations on their abdomen such as cancer and hernia operations, and removal of blockages in the bowel. It did not including heart surgery. Of the 170,000 elderly and other high-risk patients who have these procedures every year more than half - 100,000 – will suffer some complication. And 25,000 – one in seven – will die. Many develop infections – including life-threatening blood poisoning sepsis - which is not spotted by inexperienced junior doctors. The surgeons warn that the death-rate . is far higher than other countries in the Western world – and four . times more than in the US. They also say the failings are partly due to an obsession with meeting targets. 'Seriously underprioritised': The report looked at the care of high-risk patients who had undergone common operations . Managers and doctors are more . concerned with getting patients booked into surgery within the required . 18 weeks waiting-time, rather than ensuring the most vulnerable receive . the highest standard of care. Norman . Williams, President of the Royal College of Surgeons said: ‘The focus . on reducing waiting times for elective procedures has resulted in a . large group, of mostly elderly patients, becoming seriously under . prioritised to the point of neglect in the some NHS hospitals. All patients should have a clear diagnostic and monitoring plan when admitted to hospital. Seniority of staff involved and urgency of treatment must reflect estimated risk to patient. Each patient should have expected risk of death documented prior to surgery or other intervention. Surgical procedures with a death risk greater than 10% should be supervised by a consultant surgeon and consultant anaesthetist. Patients with estimated risk higher than 10% following surgery must be admitted to critical care. Complications must be managed with an 'escalation strategy' with defined time-points and involvement of senior staff. Resulting care plans must be routinely recorded and reviewed. 'These . changes won’t happen on their own and we are calling on all surgeons . and managers to work together to deliver the high quality care that . these patients need and which some hospitals are already proving can be . delivered.' Mr Iain Anderson, report author and . Consultant General Surgeon at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, said: . 'Every single emergency patient who comes through the door of an NHS . hospital should have an individual risk assessment, diagnosis, treatment . plan and post-operative care plan prioritised according to need. 'Instead . we have some of the NHS’ sickest patients languishing on inappropriate . wards, treated by juniors and with no plan in place to deal promptly . with unexpected complications. 'These tend to be the patients who end up in intensive care units for lengthy periods of time or, sadly too sick to be helped.' The Mail has long highlighted the poor care of those in old age as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Michelle . Mitchell, Charity Director of Age UK, said: 'This is just more evidence . that the NHS is not responding to the needs of older people who . constitute the bulk of its patients. 'It’s shocking that some of the UK’s sickest and most vulnerable men and women are not receiving the  emergency surgical and post operative care they need – care which can mean the difference between life and death. 'Improved  care and treatment  and routine risk assessments should be the right of every vulnerable patient not just those lucky enough to be  in the right hospital.' Grandmother Jean Dawson (pictured, right) went into hospital in to have a thigh fracture fixed. But the 84-year-old died seven weeks later after losing two stones in weight. Her daughters Julie and Lynne were appalled by her care as they watched their mother waste away at Furness Hospital, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Julie Jones, 58, who is a nurse and has two children, said: ‘She was neglected in every way. ‘She was difficult to look after because she had severe vascular dementia but that’s no excuse, she wasn’t fed or washed, it was horrendous. We felt increasing despair as she was slipping away. 'We wanted to share some quality time with her but it was spent on nagging and complaining as we tried to get the staff to look after her.’ Mrs Dawson weighed just 4st 6lb when she died in April 2009. The family has received a ‘partial’ apology for her care. ‘I hope she didn’t know what was happening to her,’ said Mrs Jones. ‘We don’t want anyone else’s mother to go through the same ordeal.’ A spokesperson from the Department of Health said: 'We have made clear that safety must be at the heart of the NHS. It is essential that hospitals provide the safest possible care for patients. 'Hospitals should follow this guidance and monitor the quality of care they are giving to their patients and ensure that they are providing appropriate levels of services and staffing. 'We want our NHS to be truly-world class and that’s why we are modernising the health service to improve results for patients and safeguard the NHS for future generations.'",Patients who have abdominal surgery are four times more likely to die in British hospitals compared to U.S .
"Its 6million festive ad was dubbed 'one of the greatest ever' and became a social media sensation . And it seems the popularity of the 90-second clip has translated into sales success for John Lewis. The department store group enjoyed an ‘outstanding’ festive period, smashing its December sales record. The ad that shows a boy impatiently waiting for Christmas to give a present to his parents ends with the line 'for gifts you can't wait to give' and certainly seems to have struck a chord with the British public. Strong sales of clothes and electrical items helped the department store take more than £500million in the festive build-up. Scroll down to watch the ad again . The John Lewis advert cost £6million to make - but helped bring in almost £600million in pre-Christmas sales . The retail bellwether, which operates 35 stores, said sales were up 9.3 per cent to £596million in the five weeks to December 31, up 9.3 per cent on last year and 6.2 per cent higher on a directly comparable basis. Online revenues rose 28 per cent, . boosted by a near doubling in the number of shoppers using its click and . collect service, while like-for-like sales, which exclude new store . openings, were up 6 per cent. The . ad, which features a seven-year-old boy impatiently counting down the . days until he can give his parents their present on Christmas morning, . became a social media sensation after its November launch. Retail . experts said the fantastic success of the ad, called The Long Wait, . contributed to John Lewis’s remarkable sales figures which dramatically . bucked the depressed trend elsewhere on the High Street. In contrast Next's refusal to follow the high street trend of huge pre-Christmas discounts led to a drop in sales. The . fashion chain admitted to a 'disappointing' sales performance today for . high street sales between August and Christmas Eve, triggering a slump . in its share price. Strong sales of clothes and electrical items helped department store John Lewis take more than £500million . Figures . showed that sales at Next were down 2.7 per cent on a year earlier, . despite the previous year's figures being hit by cold weather. But the group, which operates 520 stores, was cheered by the strength of internet trading, with a 16.9 per cent rise in its online and catalogue Directory business. Overall sales for the Next brand were 3.1 per cent higher, in line with its guidance in November. Although the final week before . Christmas was strong, overall sales in November and December were . 'disappointing', as it refused to discount stock and maintained its . profit margins. But more people left their shopping until after Christmas when Next put on a high profile sale, which it said 'went well'. Next, . which has been one of the best-performing stocks in the FTSE 100 Index . over the past year, saw shares slump 5 per cent. Rival Marks & . Spencer fell 2 per cent. The group narrowed its full-year . profits guidance to £7million either side of £565 million, compared to . £551million a year earlier. However, it said profits next year would only show a slight improvement amid challenging conditions for consumers. Next up: Fashion chain Next is the first of a clutch of big name retailers to update the market on their Christmas performances . John Lewis’s  strongest sellers included iPads and Kindles, cashmere sweaters and bedding and linen. The period saw it smash its previous weekly sales record, when it took £133.1 million in the seven days to December 17. However, it has seen a fall in sales . in the week after Christmas as it came up against strong comparisons . with the year before when people rushed to buy big ticket items ahead of . the hike in VAT to 20 per cent. Managing director Andy Street said: 'Sales during the four weeks to Christmas Eve were outstanding.' John Lewis's pre-Christmas sales were . also flattered by softer figures from last year when the Arctic weather . kept shoppers at home. Perfumes proved a popular gift ahead . of Christmas and accounted for half of all beauty sales in one week. The . group said it sold enough Chanel No 5 and Coco Mademoiselle to fill . 3,600 champagne glasses. Next had enjoyed a strong year until the pre-Christmas slump . Other popular gifts included lingerie, speciality chocolate and Champagne. Sales of toys were strong, with a storage unit shaped like a giant Lego . man's head and Hexbug mini-robotic creatures among the favourites. Baking gadgets and brightly coloured . kitchen utensils such as cookie cutters, measures and cupcake cases and . pudding bowls were also snapped up. And sales of boys' and girls' hats, gloves and scarves and snowboots benefited from the recent cold snap. Its post-Christmas sale has seen . strong demand for laptops, TVs, Apple MacBooks, Dyson vacuum cleaners, . iPod speakers and homewares such as mattresses and duvets. Meanwhile, Matthew McEachran, an . analyst at Singer Capital Markets, said the weaker-than-expected . performance from Next may lead the City to downgrade its profits . forecasts by 3 per cent. But Next had some good news for consumers as it confirmed that it does not expect to hike prices over the coming year. The group last year openly passed on price rises, such as the soaring cost of cotton, to shoppers as it maintained its margins. It predicted that the squeeze on consumers will ease this year, with inflation dropping close to average wage growth. But it warned that the eurozone crisis and rising unemployment would continue to drag on confidence. The group said its stock levels at Christmas were 10 per cent higher than a year ago, reflecting the weak festive trade. But the strong post-Christmas sale, . which saw consumers queuing outside stores across the country after many . of its goods were reduced to half price or less, was expected to help . shift the stock. It said: 'A number of factors have . subdued sales in the final quarter and it is hard to judge to what . extent warm winter weather and higher levels of competitor discounting . masked the deeper, longer-lasting economic effects.' As a result, it was cautious about . its performance over the coming year, but said it expected to generate . £200million surplus cash to return to shareholders.",Bucks trend of gloom on the High Street that saw Next sales fall 2.7% .
"England have sprung a surprise here ahead of their World Cup campaign by making Jos Buttler their vice-captain. It emerged in Sydney that Buttler, the softy-spoken but extremely gifted keeper-batsman, was Eoin Morgan's personal choice to be his deputy on this tour. Stuart Broad is England's Twenty20 captain while Joe Root was a strong contender to become one-day captain after the sacking of Alastair Cook and is expected to become Test skipper at the end of Cook's reign. Jos Buttler has been appointed as vice-captain to Eoin Morgan for the forthcoming World Cup . Buttler bats during the final of the Tri-series tournament with Australia in Perth on February 1 . Captain Eoin Morgan personally selected Buttler as his deputy for the upcoming tournament . But Morgan clearly sees something in Buttler that makes him leadership material and it is the Lancashire man who would take over should Morgan be injured at any time during the World Cup. England were in action at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Monday in a World Cup warm-up match against West Indies when Buttler was in immediate action, taking two catches in the first over off Chris Woakes. Buttler (left) pictured with Chris Woakes (centre) and Morgan during Monday's warm-up with the West Indies . Wicketkeeper Buttler keeps a close watch as the West Indies Lendl Simmons bats in Sydney on Monday . West Indies, who quit their tour of India in October over a pay dispute and left out Dwayne Bravo and Keiron Pollard from their World Cup squad as a consequence, did not have much heart for the battle under cloudy Sydney skies and with England's bowlers gaining seam movement and bounce from the green surface. West Indies crashed to 122 all out, with Woakes taking five of the wickets for just 19 in his first match since being mauled by Australia in the final of the Tri-series in Perth eight days ago.","Jos Buttler appointed vice-captain for the upcoming World Cup .

Ozil is my idol so when I got to meet him, it was incredible. Yet I did meet all the first team players every day at the training ground when they were in, for example, the restaurant and the pool. 'The most sociable was Jack Wilshere. He always came down and talked with the young players and gave advice and tips.'

"An airplane carrying 150 terrified passengers nearly crashed at Cologne airport in Germany after the pilots were almost knocked unconscious by toxic fumes in the cockpit. And budget airline Germanwings – a subsidiary of Lufthansa – has now been accused of deliberately playing down the frightening ordeal in a bid to avoid an investigation. The near-fatal crash on 20 December 2010 was reported to the air safety authorities. However, an investigation was not launched. A Germanwings plane carrying 150 passengers nearly crashed at Cologne, Germany, in December 2010 after the cockpit filled with toxic fumes . Germany's Die Welt newspaper then teamed up with broadcaster NDR to dig up reports on the potential catastrophe. The two pilots were crippled by nausea and were barely conscious as flight 753 from Vienna began its descent into Cologne. The 26-year-old co-pilot told the captain, 35 years old, to land the airplane as his arms and legs went numb and he reached for an oxygen mask. The captain's own hands and feet then started to tingle as he took control of the airbus. The two pilots were crippled by nausea and were barely conscious as they landed flight 753 from Vienna, Austria . He began to get tunnel vision and became badly dizzy as the Germanwings plane hurtled towards the runway at more than 400 kmph. According to a medical examination afterwards, the captain had a blood oxygen level of just 70 per cent and his co-pilot's was less than 80 per cent. Healthy people have a blood saturation level of around 100 per cent. The petrified captain said he feared for his life. According to Der Spiegel magazine in Germany, the pair successfully landed the airplane and were taken away in an ambulance, watched by passengers. Germanwings submitted a report to the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation. However, the incident did not appear in the BFU’s monthly bulletin and no further action was taken. Experts only received new information on the near-fatal crash a year later by which time the black box and cockpit recorder information were no longer available. Germanwings submitted a report about the flight from Vienna, pictured, to the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation. However, no further action was taken . A spokesman for Germanwings told Die Welt that there had not been a problem. But the newspaper said it had seen a medical report from Lufthansa referring to an examination of the co-pilot six months after the incident. It said he was fully capable of service - after six months of being incapable. Experts only received fresh information on the near-fatal crash at Cologne, pictured, a year later.

"JK Rowling has accepted a substantial donation to charity from a law firm which breached her confidentiality by outing her as the author of a crime novel she wrote under a false name. Harry Potter's creator brought proceedings in London's High Court against Chris Gossage, a partner at Russells and a friend of his, Judith Callegari. The court heard Rowling had been left 'dismayed and distressed' by the 'betrayal of trust' that saw her revealed as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling, which had been published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. 'Substantial donation': Rowling, left, was 'dismayed and distressed' when she was revealed as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling, seen right . Her solicitor, Jenny Afia, told Mr . Justice Tugendhat that Rowling was revealed in the Sunday Times as the . writer of the novel. A few days later, Russells contacted her agent disclosing that it was Mr Gossage who had divulged the confidential information to Ms Callegari, who then communicated it in the course of a Twitter exchange with a journalist. Ms Afia said that Ms Rowling, who was not in court, 'has been left dismayed and distressed by such a fundamental betrayal of trust'. Mr Gossage, Ms Callegari and Russells all apologised, with the firm agreeing to reimburse Ms Rowling's legal costs and make a payment, by way of damages, to the the Soldiers' Charity, formerly the Army Benevolent Fund. Cat out of the bag: Copies of The Cuckoo's Calling began to fly off the shelves when the author's true identity was revealed . Afterwards, a statement issued on the author's behalf said that all global net royalties which would otherwise have been paid to her from book sales of The Cuckoo's Calling would be donated to The Soldiers' Charity for a period of three years, dating from July 14 - the day that Galbraith's identity was made known. Before its author's true identity was revealed, crime novel The Cuckoo's Calling was languishing at number 4,709 in Amazon's bestsellers list having sold a meagre 1,500 copies. But demand for the book went through the roof overnight after it was leaked that the name on the cover - Robert Galbraith - was in fact a pseudonym for revered Harry Potter creator JK Rowling. Her secret was revealed by The Sunday Times on July 14, which said it enlisted the services of a linguistics expert among others to analyse the assured debut novel. It later emerged that the truth came out after a partner at law firm Russells, Chris Gossage, had disclosed Robert Galbraith's true identity to his wife's best friend, Judith Callegari, during a 'private conversation' over a dinner. Ms Callegari, a mother-of-two, then revealed in a Twitter exchange with a journalist that The Cuckoo's Calling was not a debut and that 47-year-old Rowling was the real author. Within hours of the story coming out, the book leapt thousands of places to top Amazon's bestsellers list. Rowling, who some accused of setting up the leak as a marketing ploy, said she had wanted to release the book 'without hype or expectation'. She said: 'This donation is being made to The Soldiers' Charity partly as a thank you to the Army people who helped me with research, but also because writing a hero who is a veteran has given me an even greater appreciation and understanding of exactly how much this charity does for ex-servicemen and their families, and how much that support is needed. 'I always intended to give The Soldiers' Charity a donation out of Robert's royalties but I had not anticipated him making the bestseller list a mere three months after publication - indeed, I had not counted on him ever being there!' Major General Martin Rutledge, chief executive of the charity, said: 'We are absolutely thrilled by the extraordinary generosity of JK Rowling who is such an internationally renowned author. 'This donation will make a huge difference to the lives of thousands of soldiers, former soldiers and their families who are in real need. 'Her tremendous show of support for The Soldiers' Charity will help to remind people of the many sacrifices made by our soldiers, long after any news of Afghanistan has left the front page.' Ms Afia told the court that the author used the pseudonym to release the book in April free from the unprecedented publicity and expectation that accompanied her work. Only a handful of trusted advisers, family and friends were aware of Galbraith's true identity until the front-page story made headlines worldwide. 'The claimant was angry and distressed that her confidences had been betrayed and this was very much aggravated by repeated speculation that the leak had, in fact, been a carefully co-ordinated publicity stunt by her, her agent and her publishers designed to increase sales. 'The claimant has been left dismayed and distressed by such a fundamental betrayal of trust. 'As a reflection of their regret for breach of the claimant's confidence, including frustrating the claimant's ability to continue to write anonymously under the name Robert Galbraith, the defendants are here today to apologise publicly to the claimant.'","Author wrote The Cuckoo's Calling under pseudonym Robert Galbraith .

"The Qatar World Cup in 2022 could be played safely between May 5 and June 4 rather than in the winter, the European Club Association has argued. Football's world governing body FIFA announced last month that the most likely time slots for the tournament would be either January/February or November/December 2022, with the organisation's medical chief warning that temperatures in the Middle East state between May and September posed a 'highly critical risk'. However, the ECA, in conjunction with the European Professional Football Leagues (EPFL), has put together a proposal which it feels demonstrates how the tournament could be played in May and June without putting the health of players, supporters and officials at risk. FIFA President Sepp Blatter pictured announcing that Qatar will be hosting the 2022 World Cup . Qatar  2022 could be played between May 5 and June 4 rather than in winter, argue European Club Association . The organisations also argue that their proposal would have the least impact on the 2021-22 or 2022-23 club calendars, which would need to be seriously revised if either of the options favoured by FIFA is ratified. A section of the proposal from the ECA and EPFL reads: 'The May option is the best alternative to the traditional June-July timing, since it retains the logical calendar order and avoids compressing such an important competition as the World Cup in the middle of the traditional and busy club football season (winter season). 'As such, simply avoiding this concentration makes the May option by far less intrusive compared to all winter proposals.' The ECA and EPFL propose matches in the group stages - which under their plans would run from May 5 to 19, 2022 - would be played between 6pm and 11pm local time. Knockout matches, starting from May 21, would kick off at either 7pm or 10pm local time. Under the wet-bulb globe temperature (WGBT) reading, a measure used to determine the level of risk caused by exposure to certain climatic conditions, they argue only games kicking off at 6pm or 7pm could be classified as 'high risk', with other games under the WGBT measurement deemed 'moderate risk'. An artist's illustration provided by Qatar 2022 of the 45,330 capacity Al Khor stadium . The organisations argue their proposal would have the least impact on the 2021-22 or 2022-23 club calendars . They cite two games played at last summer's World Cup in Brazil - Germany vs Portugal in Salvador and the United States vs Portugal clash in Manaus, as posing the same high risk, and also report that on-field temperatures at the 1994 World Cup final between Italy and Brazil in Pasadena reached 48 degrees Celsius, far higher than any they anticipate being encountered at those kick-off times in Qatar, based on past data. The proposal document continued: 'The May 2022 option provides acceptable climatic conditions with regard to both players and fans. In May the average temperature in Qatar as of 6pm local time is between 30 to 35 degrees Celsius (source: Meteosuisse) and the WBGT index would be 'green' (moderate) for most World Cup games. 'In worst case, games would be played in circumstances similar to some cities in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup (Fortaleza, Manaus) and still better than some games played at the World Cups in Mexico (1986) and the USA (1994). FIFA announced last month  the likely time slots would be  January/February or November/December 2022 . 'Moreover, with the support of the cooling systems that the Qatar Local Organising Committee committed to, temperature in the stadiums would be perfect.' FIFA's chief medical officer Jiri Dvorak made a presentation to the FIFA task force considering dates for the tournament last month. He said at that time: 'What I have said is that for the players, the accompanying staff and the fans the months June till August are highly critical in terms of risk, due to the climatic conditions in Qatar. 'In May and September it is borderline when it comes to the temperature of high risk but from the medical point of view it is not recommended. 'The months from October until March are actually optimal in terms of the temperature.' The ECA and EPFL will present their proposal at the next task force meeting early next year, on a date yet to be confirmed.","The ECA have put together a proposal for the tournament to be played in May and June without putting health of players, fans and officials at risk .

"Chasing mice is a distant memory, and her fur isn’t as fluffy as it used to be. But at the grand age of 24, Poppy has reason to celebrate – after being crowned the oldest cat in the world. Guinness World Records announced that the tortoiseshell pet has clocked up 114 ‘cat years’ since her birth in February 1990. Birthday: Poppy from Bournemouth, Dorset, has now been recognised as the world's oldest living cat . Family: Poppy the cat with owner Jacqui West and her two sons Joe (left), 12, and Toby (right), eight . Poppy is now frail and spends most of . her time indoors, but she has been recognised by Guinness World Records - . and is two years younger than Misao Okawa of Japan, the world’s oldest . person. The cat - who . was originally called Popsy and had two owners in her early days - has . picked up the title following the death of Pinky, a cat from Hoyt in . Kansas, US, who passed away aged 23 last year. At . the age of five Poppy was adopted by Marguerite Corner and her daughter . Jacqui. When she was ten she went with Jacqui, who had moved in with . future husband Andy West. The . couple now have two sons - Joe,11 and Toby, eight - and Poppy shares . their home with four other cats, two rabbits and a hamster. Frail: Poppy, who is now aged 24, was born in February 1990 and has lived through five British prime ministers . She is deaf and blind, but despite her age and frailty she is still said to be the boss of the house. 'She . is partial to the odd takeaway. We sometimes give her a bit of KFC . chicken, fish and chips and even the odd bit of kebab meat' Jacqui West, owner . Mrs West, 43, said: ‘People . always ask what we put Poppy’s longevity down to and I guess she has a . good diet and lots of exercise.  She keeps herself fit by walking around . and she eats a lot. ‘She . has biscuits in the morning and tinned food later on. She’s never been a . big cat though.  She is partial to the odd takeaway. We sometimes give . her a bit of KFC chicken, fish and chips and even the odd bit of kebab . meat.’ Mrs West, an . accountant, wrote to Guinness World Records in February after Poppy . turned 24, submitting her into the category of ‘Oldest Cat Currently . Living’. Days gone by: A photograph of Poppy the cat taken in 1997, when she was aged seven in cat years . Early days:  Poppy (left) was adopted aged five by Marguerite Corner (pictured) and her daughter Jacqui . They investigated their claim and have now confirmed Poppy as the world’s oldest living cat. Craig . Glenday, Guinness World Records editor-in-chief, said: ‘We’ve been . overwhelmed with claims for the “oldest living cat”, with owners from . across the globe making applications on behalf of their cats. ‘Today, though, I’m pleased to confirm that we’re recognising Poppy from Bournemouth in the UK as the world’s oldest living cat, at the age of 24 years. ‘If anyone thinks their cat beats this, and can prove it, then we’d encourage them to get in touch with us.’ Difference: At 24 in cat years, Poppy has lived twice as long as Joe (right) and three times as long as Toby (left) The oldest cat in history was a feline called Creme Puff who lived in Austin, Texas, and survived for an astonishing 38 years and three days. 'I’m pleased to confirm that we’re recognising Poppy from Bournemouth in the UK as the world’s oldest living cat, at the age of 24 years' Craig Glenday, Guinness World Records . Mrs West added: ‘Poppy is definitely the top cat and she is still quite feisty. If one of the other cats tries to eat her food she will bite them on the ear. ‘She’s deaf and blind and meows for everything. We call her stroppy Poppy sometimes.  She can get up the stairs but we won’t let her walk down. Over the last year her health has gone down and we know the end is near. ‘We knew she is old but to be officially recognised is just great. We are all chuffed for her. I think all old cats deserve recognition of their achievement. As a family, we are so pleased that she is still with us as well. Record holder: Poppy's age of 24 in cat years is equivalent to 114 in human years - two years younger than Misao Okawa of Japan, the world's oldest person . ‘There have been times in this last year when her health has declined and I’ve thought it was the end on several occasions but then she recovers and carries on. 'Poppy does seem to be out-living all our other pets too. We unfortunately had a hamster and bunny die on us last year.

"Turns out it wasn’t all va-va-voom. Thierry Henry put his success down to hard work and dedication, with a little inspiration from Arsene Wenger, Pep Guardiola and others, as he hung up his shooting boots and prepared for a new life in television. Henry will shelve his coaching ambitions to accept a six-year deal with Sky Sports, worth £4million a year, starting in the new year with the 37-year-old Frenchman operating as an expert pundit and global ambassador. It means a return to London, the city where he achieved status as a living legend and where a statue in his honour stands outside Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to see the tributes flooding in for Arsenal legend Thierry Henry . Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has retired from football to become a fox on the box with Sky Sports . Henry moved from Juventus to Arsenal in August 1999 for a fee of about £11m under Arsene Wenger . Henry became such a living legend in north London that he earned his very own statue at the Emirates . Henry has joined Sky Sports with Jamie Redknapp, Jamie Carragher, Gary Neville, Graeme Souness and Co . After two decades scoring goals, Henry said: ‘It feels like a logical step. It gives me the possibility to stay close to the game and help people understand it better.’ He has in the past spoken of his desire to coach, and Wenger said the door would always be open for him at Arsenal. ‘To become a coach you need to get your badges,’ said Henry. ‘That is the plan, to go through that process, but we are far from that at the moment. Everyone is busy at Arsenal and nobody is going to stop what they’re doing for me. ‘I’ve taken my decision and the next chapter is coming. I love London, where everything changed in my life. The Premier League made me grow as a player. It is still competitive and demanding. You see goals and the passion of the fans everywhere. 'I can’t wait to get back. My thing will be talking about the game, not to have a go at anyone or talk about what the guy did in the morning or his haircut or the shirt he wears or his boots.’ Henry's effortless technique on show as he shoots during the 2004 Champions League quarter-final .

FRANCE 1997-2010 . 123 appearances, 51 goals . Henry’s announcement was met with an outpouring of affection for one of the greatest footballers of the Premier League era. ‘A true inspiration,’ said Theo Walcott. ‘Top player, top guy,’ said Aaron Ramsey. ‘My idol,’ said Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. ‘A true legend,’ said Cesc Fabregas. It was a reminder of the magnitude of his achievements, which also include world and European titles with France. ‘Playing for 20 years will be the biggest achievement,’ said Henry. ‘Not many strikers last that long. I have a lot of amazing memories — and some bad memories — along the way. ‘I was told at the start of my career that if you worked hard and dedicated yourself to the game, you would win some things along the way. That’s what I did and it did happen.’ Chief among those who mentored this fabulous talent was Wenger. ‘He’s been a father-figure,’ said Henry. ‘Everybody knows what he’s done for Arsenal and he helped me a lot. I hope I helped him a bit. I can talk to him about anything. He has always been the guy who inspired me.’ Henry has admitted Arsenal manager Wenger has 'been a father-figure' to him in north London and Monaco .

Why Henry is one of the best players eve . Wenger was Monaco manager when Henry emerged at the French club and signed him again for Arsenal from Juventus in 1999, converting him from a winger into a striker who was the club’s top scorer by the time he left North London for Barcelona, eight years later. During this time, his goals fuelled two Barclays Premier League titles, the Invincibles, a 49-game unbeaten run, and a Champions League final. He returned on loan from New York Red Bulls in 2012, and rates the first of his two goals in this brief second coming, in the FA Cup against Leeds, as his favourite. ‘I enjoyed scoring any goal that counted for something in the game,’ he said. ‘The one against Leeds, when I came back, stands out. It was a dream.’ He finished with 228 goals in 377 appearances for Arsenal and a total of 360 goals for his five clubs in five different countries, including 49 for Barcelona, when he played for Guardiola in one of the best club teams ever assembled.

"A fire chief has caused outrage after striking a deal to quit his £200,000-a-year post, receive an estimated £700,000 payoff and then walk straight back into his former job. London Fire Brigade Commissioner Ron Dobson has been allowed to ‘retire’ and gain access to his pension entitlements – giving him a maximum of £133,000 a year, two thirds of his salary. But the 52-year-old has been instantly re-employed into his old position, albeit on lower pay. Laughing all the way to the bank: Dobson (far left), shares a joke with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair and Mayor Boris Johnson . His total earnings are now likely to be . close to what they were before he retired. The deal has sparked fury . from the Fire Brigades Union, which has branded it ‘deeply unethical’ at . a time when many firefighters are facing job cuts and pay freezes. Officials believe Mr Dobson has been allowed to dodge any future cuts to . pensions and increases in tax to his lump sum by being allowed to leave . early. They are also angry that he was allowed to walk back into his old post . without other candidates being considered for the position. Payout: London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson retired with a generous payout only to walk back into his old job . The Press and the public were asked to leave a meeting of the fire . authority before the retirement and re-employment of Mr Dobson were . discussed under an item listed as ‘continuity arrangements’. Paul Embery, regional official of the union, said: . ‘It appears deeply . unethical for a deal like this to be hammered out in secret at a time . when ordinary firefighters are suffering tough austerity measures. ‘When firefighters are subject to a pay freeze and 25 per cent cuts in spending, this is obscene. ‘It shows there’s one rule for fat cats and another for the rest of us. ‘This kind of decision should be made in public so that it can be . properly scrutinised instead of being made in a cloak and dagger way.’ Emma Boon, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This practice of . double-dipping – claiming pay and a pension – has happened in other . parts of the public sector and is costing taxpayers dearly. It must . stop.’ The firefighters’ pension scheme allows for a two-thirds salary pension, . which would give Mr Dobson £133,333 annually, based on his final salary . of around £200,000 a year. Workers may convert up to quarter of their pension into a lump sum . called a ‘commutation’ – which would allow Mr Dobson to draw £716,000. If he takes this, his annual pension would be reduced to about £100,000. Last night a London Fire Brigade spokesman declined to discuss the . figures, but insisted the move represented a ‘cost saving’ because of Mr . Dobson’s lower salary. It ensured a highly regarded commissioner was in office during the run-up to the 2012 Olympics and beyond, he added. Mr Dobson is married with three children and oversees 7,000 staff in the . world’s third-largest fire and rescue service. He joined in 1979 and . became commissioner in 2007. In May, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service’s chief fire officer, Peter . Holland, retired on a £425,000 payout and was re-hired on a £75,000 . salary. Strathclyde Fire and Rescue chief Brian Sweeney retired with an . estimated £500,000 pension lump sum and walked back into his old job . with a salary of £150,000. Under a three-year contract, he was unable to touch his £75,000 annual pension. At the time, he said: ‘People need to understand it’s not taxpayers’ money – it’s my private pension.’","Commissioner Ron Dobson is able to draw a yearly six-figure sum after receiving the huge pay-out, plus his new salary .

"Women who use the internet to seek boyfriends will win the right to force the police to reveal if they have a history of violence under plans being considered by Home Secretary Theresa May. The controversial move is in response to fears that the growing phenomenon of internet dating means more and more women are going out with men whose backgrounds they know little about. The proposal has been called ‘Clare’s Law’, after the horrific killing of 36-year-old mother Clare Wood by a man she met on Facebook. George Appleton strangled Ms Wood and set her body on fire before hanging himself. Horrific killing: Clare Wood was strangled and set on fire by her former boyfriend George Appleton, who she met on Facebook . Friends and family were shocked to discover that the killer had a history of violence against women, including repeated harassment, threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his other ex-girlfriends. A Clare’s Law campaign is to be launched tomorrow. It is modelled on Sarah’s Law’, the successful fight to give parents the right to check on paedophiles in their area after the murder of schoolgirl  Sarah Payne. In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mrs May indicates she is considering introducing Clare’s Law and will make an announcement in the next few weeks. She says: ‘Tackling violence against women and girls is a priority for this Government.’ However, some believe the well-intentioned plan could jeopardise civil liberties. Tory MP Robert Buckland, a member of the Commons Justice Committee, said: ‘We’re all in favour of curbing violence against women but we have to be certain this will not lead to fishing expeditions by women demanding confidential information about potential boyfriends without proper justification. History of violence: George Appleton was discovered hanged six days after Clare's body was found . ‘You cannot have a carte blanche . system where people can simply turn up at a police station, give the . name of a boyfriend or potential boyfriend, and expect the police to . open up all the files on him. There will have to be strict controls on . any proposal of this nature.’ Supporters of Clare’s Law insist that there would be safeguards to prevent any such abuse. But Louise Casey, the Government’s . victims’ commissioner, said: ‘Our priority should not be protecting a . perpetrator’s privacy at the expense of costing a woman’s life.’ The Clare’s Law campaign is being led by former Labour Cabinet Minister Hazel Blears and Ms Wood’s father, Michael Brown. Mr Brown, 67, a former prison officer, . last night told The Mail on Sunday he would do ‘anything I can’ to get . the proposals agreed, adding: ‘There needs to be greater protection.’ He also said: ‘My daughter wasn’t stupid. If she had known about that man’s past, she would have taken herself out of there in a heartbeat.’ Former Home Office Minister  Ms Blears, who was Ms Wood’s  MP, said the launch just a few weeks ago of a national police database made Clare’s Law checks simple to carry out. The Salford MP said: ‘Women in Clare’s situation often are unaware of their partner’s previous relationships and this can mean they start a relationship with someone with no idea if they have a violent past. Until women are given the right to know if their partner has a history of serial domestic abuse, they can’t be sure of the risk that they face. ‘By changing the law we can empower women so that they can take informed action about their relationship and give them the chance to protect themselves.’ Inspiration: 'Clare's Law' has been modelled on Sarah's Law', which was introduced after the murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne . Ms Blears pointed out that a survey showed overwhelming backing for Clare’s Law, with 91 per cent of women consulted saying a person had the right to know if their partner had a recorded history of domestic violence. The radical proposals are based on recommendations by Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Brian Moore, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on violence against women. The draft Clare’s Law scheme would . include allowing women with concerns about their partners to apply to . their local police station for information on any violent past. More . controversially, police would proactively warn women that their partner . was a potential danger. Police . sources stressed that information would be released only by police . officers of inspector rank and above, and after they were fully . satisfied someone’s concerns about their partner was genuine. Home Secretary Theresa May is considering introducing 'Clare's Law', which will force the police to tell women if their partner has a history of violence . After the inquest into Ms Wood’s death, coroner Jennifer Leeming wrote to the Home Office to recommend a system of checks which has become the basis of Clare’s Law. Ms Wood was initially charmed by Appleton’s persona after meeting him online, but his violent side soon surfaced and he subjected her to a string of sexual assaults. After they split he strangled her and set on fire in Salford in February 2009. When he went on the run he was quickly dubbed the ‘Facebook Fugitive’. Six days after Ms Wood’s body was found, Appleton was discovered hanged in a derelict pub. Ms Wood had first called police in October 2008 after he damaged her front door, threatened her with an iron and threatened to kill her. The Independent Police Complaints Commission later ruled she had been badly let down by police. Last night, sources close to the Home Secretary said: ‘We’re looking into this although no final decision has yet been made.’ Sarah’s Law was rolled out last year to give parents the legal right to know if anyone with regular access to children posed a risk. It followed the murder of Sarah Payne by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000.","Fears that growth of internet dating means more women are meeting strangers .

"Esteban Gutierrez has been named as Ferrari's test and reserve driver for the 2015 Formula One campaign after being axed by Sauber.

"A suspected art thief has been photographed trying to hack a Banksy - potentially worth thousands of dollars - from the wall of a rundown building in New Orleans. The man, who identified himself only as Chris, claimed he was a 'private art handler' moving it to the Tate Modern art gallery in London for an upcoming retrospective in April. The world famous gallery insisted no such exhibition was scheduled, when contacted by MailOnline. Chipping away: A man, who identified himself only as Chris but claimed to be a 'private art handler' from Los Angeles, takes a heavy duty drill to the Banksy art work 'Girl with Umbrella' on a wall in New Orleans . Suspicions were aroused on Friday when . a team of men, brandishing heavy duty drilling tools, erected a wooden . screen to obscure the view of the precious art work. Photographer Charlie Varley recounted his conversation with one of the men outside the drop-in center. 'He called himself Chris and said it would be shipped to Tate Modern in London,' he said. Residents said the group of at least four people spent hours smashing away bricks holding the work titled Girl with Umbrella from the wall. Denial: The man claimed the Girl with Umbrella would be shipped to London for a Tate Modern retrospective of Banksy's work in April - though the museum confirmed that no such exhibition is scheduled . Hidden: Neighbours watched men erect a wooden screen, pictured, around the Banksy on the side of a drop-in centre, so they could work without being seen . When concerned neighbours approached the work party, they were told the Banksy was being donated to 'the museum', according to another resident. 'They said they were removing the piece to take it to a museum,' Tracie Ashe told WWLTV.COM . 'They didn’t specify which museum, and then he asked them for their permit. They didn’t have a permit. 'He . also asked them who the owner was and if they had the owner’s . permission and they wouldn’t give the owner’s name.  When he kept . questioning them about that, they packed up their equipment and left. ‘It’s a little bit scary because the wall definitely needs to be repaired. It could possibly be a load-bearing corner.' In demand: As the value of Banksy works have spiraled - with one selling for $1.8m - thieves have increasingly targeted the art . A security guard has now been stationed on the site to protect it from any further attempt to remove it. The man claimed they had permission of the building's owner to remove the work - a claim local media have not been able to verify. Representatives . from the New Orleans Museum of Art and Ogden Museum of Southern Art both . said their institutions had no plans to acquire the work, according to the NOLA Defender. The . street art stencil first appeared in 2008 before the third . anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. As the value of Banksy works have spiraled into the stratosphere - with one selling for $1.8m - fears have grown that they will be targeted by thieves. A Banksy mural which was controversially ripped from the wall of a north London shop was withdrawn from sale at an auction in Miami amid claims it had been stolen. Slave Labour, which shows a young boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, appeared on the wall in Wood Green, north London, in May, 2012, just before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. It disappeared from the side of the Poundland store and was due to be auctioned thousands of miles away in Miami but was withdrawn hours before the sale.","Concerned residents challenged the group of men hacking at the art work .

"Real Madrid skipper Iker Casillas and vice-captain Sergio Ramos were left unimpressed by a number of first-team players' decision to go out and celebrate Cristiano Ronaldo's 30th birthday just hours after Saturday's heavy defeat to rivals Atletico, according to Marca. The general feeling among the squad after seeing pictures of the gathering was that the party was inappropriate so soon after the 4-0 defeat at the Vicente Calderon. Ronaldo was reportedly joined by close friends Pepe, Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao as well as James Rodriguez, Luka Modric, Sami Khedira and Keylor Navas at the party. Assistant managers Paul Clement and Fernando Hierro were also said to be in attendance. Cristiano Ronaldo was criticised after being filmed partying hours after Real Madrid were thrashed by Atletico . The Portuguese star, pictured with singing with Kevin Roldan (left), was celebrating his 30th birthday . However, Casillas and Ramos decided against attending and it is expected players will demand an explanation from Ronaldo and Co. It is believed several first-teamers were also angered by the player's willingness to sing on stage and pose for pictures. Meanwhile, Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has insisted the player was far from in the party spirit. After a video showing Ronaldo enjoying his birthday celebrations appeared in the Spanish media, Mendes told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: 'He (Ronaldo) was very angry. Any player that loses a game and more so, Ronaldo, who is a great professional, who continues to be the best professional in the world, would be angry. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes defended the Ballon d'Or winners decision to go ahead with the party . 'The fact is that his birthday party had been organised more than a month ago and he had family coming from abroad. 'He didn't want to cancel out of respect for the people that came. 'What is inadmissible is that somebody takes advantage of a private affair to release a video. 'Ronaldo was devastated after the defeat and people spent two hours trying to cheer him up.' Ronaldo was crowned World Player of the Year last month for the third time in his career, and the Portugal international has enjoyed an impressive campaign so far.

The striker (right) had played the full 90 minutes of their defeat to rivals Atletico on Saturday . A disgruntled Ronaldo looks on after Atletico players celebrate scoring their first of four goals . 'It's very difficult to be Cristiano, honestly,' Mendes said. 'In life, there are good times and times when things don't go as well. 'The problem is that Cristiano has accustomed people badly because 99 per cent of the times he does extremely well. 'He decides games, he does everything. 'But when he goes through a spell when things don't go as well, people should stand behind him because we are talking about the best player in the world. 'He is a human being.

"Everyone knows that eating a supersize pizza, bulging burger or ice cream sundae is bad for you. But now scientists have warned that bingeing on junk food on a regular basis can scar a person's DNA. The new research poses the possibility for bad diets and unhealthy eating habits to be passed on to the next generation. The study, published in Nutrition Journal, found that eating fast food can lead to a greater risk of cancer, inflammation, infections and allergic reactions. A new study has revealed that binging on junk food, such as fatty burgers (pictured) on a regular basis scars our DNA and can lead to a greater risk of cancer, inflammation, infections and allergic reactions . And worse still, if a poor diet of junk food becomes a regular habit, the dietary choices become encoded in DNA and damage the gut’s microbiome, or environment, too, Medical Daily reported. ‘Our bodies are a kind of mini-ecosystem and anything that disturbs our bacteria can alter our health in profound ways,’ Ian Myles of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Maryland, told Time. If a poor diet of junk food becomes a regular habit, the dietary choices become encoded in DNA, scientists said . The study suggests that food choices permanently change the balance of bacteria in the gut and can weaken the immune system. He explained that the Western diet is particularly bad at upsetting people’s immune systems and guts and could even potentially lead to more people suffering from auto immune diseases. The study says: ‘[It] appears unlikely that synthetic supplements or probiotics will be able to fully counterbalance the damage of our dietary choices, let alone undo them, if they are not accompanied by lifestyle modifications. ‘Of potentially greatest concern, our poor dietary behaviours are encoded into both our DNA scaffolding and gut microbiome and thus these harmful immune modifications are passed to our offspring during their most critical developmental window.' Previous research has shown that the bacteria in the gut adapts to suit a person’s diet. The scientists have now found that there are adjustments in both the types of bacteria found and their gene expressions. Dr Myles advises that people should cut out sugar and fat in processed from their diets and instead focus on fresh sources of protein – and fat – such as fish and meat.","Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Maryland have warned that bad diets can be encoded into DNA .
Eating fast food regularly can lead to a greater risk of cancer, inflammation, infections and allergic reactions .

"Liverpool are sweating on the fitness of key midfielder Lucas Leiva amid fears that he could be set for a month on the sidelines. The Brazil international only lasted 15 minutes of Saturday's 0-0 draw with Everton after damaging his thigh and he will undergo a scan on Monday to discover the full extent of the problem. Lucas was absent for the 2-1 win over Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup with an abductor problem but this is a different, more serious issue and is almost certain to keep him out of a sequence of key fixtures. Liverpool are sweating on the fitness of key midfielder Lucas Leiva (left, pictured on Saturday) The Brazil international  lasted just 15 minutes of Saturday's 0-0 draw with Everton after damaging his thigh . Lucas, who was replaced by Joe Allen, will undergo a scan to discover the full extent of the problem . Starting with Tuesday night's Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham, Liverpool have an FA Cup fifth-round tie at Crystal Palace, two Europa League games with Besiktas and a trip to Southampton on their schedule in February and how they fare in those games will have a bearing on their ambitions. Should Lucas be absent for all those matches, it would be a major blow for manager Brendan Rodgers, as Liverpool's form had significantly improved since he restored the 28-year-old to the starting line-up. Lucas had been a target for Inter Milan in the January transfer window but Rodgers made it clear that he wanted to keep him and it has not gone unnoticed that the only Premier League defeat they have suffered in the last two months - at Manchester United on December 14 - came when Lucas was not in the team. Lucas had been a target for Inter Milan in the January transfer window following his fine form for the Reds . Lucas's absence through injury would be a major blow for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . There is a concern, though, that Liverpool will have to do without Lucas for a sustained period. This is not the first time Lucas has had a thigh injury ruin his progress: during Rodgers' second Premier League game in charge of Liverpool against Manchester City in August 2012, he ruptured his quad muscle and ended up being sidelined for three months. Both player and manager - who is giving a scheduled press conference on Monday afternoon - will be desperate to avoid a similar lay-off. Injuries are starting to have an impact on Rodgers' plans. He hopes Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho will be fit to face Tottenham after they picked up knocks against Everton, while Adam Lallana is also battling to be fit after missing the trip to Goodison Park. 'The only downfall of being in cup competitions is the number of games,' Rodgers said after the 0-0 draw. 'But whatever happens with injuries to players the squad will be better for the experience. 'If we are playing one game a week we are not in cup competitions and not doing as well as we would want. We want the games to come, this is a challenging year, but we will be better when we come out of this year and so will the players. 'Phil Coutinho had a knock on his knee and Raheem had a knock on his foot. We had fresh players on the bench to bring on and hopefully they will be fit for Tuesday.'

"For a goalkeeper widely viewed as a liability in the first part of the season, Simon Mignolet's transformation has been quite remarkable. The Liverpool stopper hasn't conceded a Premier League goal in 390 minutes, playing his role in a New Year resurgence that sees the Reds thinking about the top four again. The Belgian hasn't let in a goal since the hour mark of their New Year's Day draw With Leicester City, subsequently keeping clean sheets in the league fixtures with Sunderland, Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Star Men Stats: Simon Mignolet vs David de Gea . Simon Mignolet's form has greatly improved for Liverpool and he has gone 390 minutes without conceding . Mignolet makes a flying save during Liverpool's goalless draw at Everton on Saturday evening . Mignolet has not conceded in the Premier League since the New Year's Day draw with Leicester City . Premier League goalkeeper clean sheet record this season - statistics courtesy of Opta . For all the criticism levelled at him, Mignolet's clean sheet record compares favourably with his Premier League peers. Only Southampton's Fraser Forster (11) and Swansea's Lukasz Fabianski (9) have recorded more shutouts than Mignolet's eight. West Brom's Ben Foster has also kept eight clean sheets and has played one game more than Mignolet. But the Liverpool man still has a better record of clean sheets than the likes of David de Gea, Thibaut Courtois and Hugo Lloris. Mignolet's form had become so patchy he was dropped by Rodgers for the match with Manchester United at Old Trafford back in December. Mignolet fails to keep out an effort from Eduardo Vargas during Liverpool's match with QPR in October . Mignolet was at fault for this Dani Abalo goal for Ludogorets in the Champions League earlier this season . Brad Jones took over for that game and subsequent matches with Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup and Arsenal in the league before suffering an injury at Burnley. Since being restored to the side, Mignolet seems to have eradicated some of the mistakes, especially with crosses and in one-on-one situations, that had caused Rodgers such anxiety. The manager noted his improvement in comments made last week: 'Simon's shown the benefits of having a bit of time out of the side. 'He looks like a different goalkeeper. Simons's spell out was for him to take a step back, analyse performance and the areas where he could improve. Mignolet has kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Manchester United's David de Gea . Mignolet has also kept more clean sheets than Chelsea stopper and compatriot Thibaut Courtois . Brendan Rodgers has been impressed by Mignolet's transformation since he was dropped from the team . 'He's a wonderful shot-stopper, he's starting to be more aggressive with crosses and is probably thinking less. 'I'm delighted for him because he has worked very hard at his game.' Mignolet will be vital as Liverpool hurtle into an important phase of the season - they play fellow top-four contenders Tottenham at Anfield on Tuesday night, then head to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fifth round. Next week also sees the resumption of their Europa League campaign with two legs against Turkish side Besiktas.","Mignolet has gone 390 minutes without conceding in Premier League .

"Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The Venezuelan became friends with Murray during their time together at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona and had worked with the Scot for the past five years. Murray announced last month that Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green had left the team, describing the split as 'mutual' in a short statement. Dani Vallverdu (right) works with Andy Murray on the practice court at this year's French Open in Paris . Vallverdu's role in Murray's team increased under Ivan Lendl but the 28-year-old found himself taking a step back when Amelie Mauresmo succeeded Lendl as coach in the summer. Vallverdu has wasted no time finding a new job, and landing a lead coaching position with world No 7 Berdych shows the high regard in which he is held. In a statement on his Facebook page, Berdych said: 'Dear fans and friends ...my new coach for next year will be Danny Vallverdu and Azuz Simcich...thank you to Tomas Krupa and David Vydra for great time and fantastic work.' World No 7 Tomas Berdych in action for the Singapore Slammers at the International Premier Tennis League . Berdych began working with fellow Czech Krupa in 2009 but had been searching for a new influence after seeing most of his rivals appoint big-name coaches. Lendl was his number one choice but the eight-time grand slam champion has so far resisted attempts to lure him back into coaching on the tour. It seems very likely, however, that Lendl's appreciation for Vallverdu's talents will have played a part in Berdych's decision. Murray, who is currently at his pre-season training camp in Miami, intends to appoint a replacement for Vallverdu to work alongside Mauresmo .

"For a club defined by its offensive flair and imagination, Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United look to have ran out of ideas in the final third. They had to rely on defensive midfielder Daley Blind to rescue a stoppage-time point at West Ham on Sunday after another lethargic attacking display. So what is going wrong up top for United? Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at their four frontmen… . VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Star Men Stats: Wayne Rooney vs Robin van Persie . Radamel Falcao (15 Premier League apps, four goals, three assists) The chances of United signing Falcao on a permanent basis are now about as slim as the Colombian embarking on a scoring streak. For the numbers just do not add up; age, transfer fee, salary and goals. It will cost United £50million to sign a four-goal 28-year-old on wages north of £150,000 a week. That makes about as much sense as some of Van Gaal’s team selections and tactics. Radamel Falcao has failed to impress in attack for Manchester United since his loan move from Monaco . Falcao (centre) wasted a glorious chance to score for United against West Ham when he shot wide on Sunday . The Colombia international (centre) watches on as hit shot goes wide of the post instead of towards goal . Goals aside, even, Falcao’s overall contribution has been disappointing and he is averaging just one shot per game. Where is that devastating striker who smashed a hat-trick past Chelsea in the colours of Atletico Madrid in the European Super Cup of 2012? He’s certainly not at Old Trafford. For injury has undoubtedly diminished his powers. Falcao seems at odds with himself, unable to impact in the manner he once could. Gone is the swagger which made him the most coveted striker in Europe. Falcao's heat map in United's 1-1 draw away at West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday . The 28-year-old's heat map wasn't much better in United's 3-1 win at home to Leicester on January 31 . There is a disconnect with team-mates, too, a failure to strike any sort of understanding with those around him. With 15 league appearances he cannot blame a lack of opportunity, either. The only saving grace for United is the ‘try before you buy’ nature of his loan deal from Monaco. At this rate, they’ve had a try, and they won’t be buying. United boss Louis van Gaal consoles his forward at full-time as United salvage a point on Sunday . Robin van Persie (22 apps, nine goals, two assists) Look at a season-by-season record of Van Persie’s time in England. His career very evidently peaks in 2012, the year which straddles 30 Premier League goals for Arsenal and 26 for United, the latter of which won Sir Alex Ferguson a farewell title. Those two years apart, his best returns read; 18, 12, 11, 11, 9. The point is this: Van Persie is by no means a guaranteed source of goals, primarily because his fitness record hasn’t allowed him to be. On his day, of course, he was the best. But therein lies the problem, his best days are behind him. Even at the relatively young age of 31, Van Persie is a fading force. Falcao partnered  Robin van Persie (centre) in attack but the duo failed to work effectively in tandem . Against West Ham on Sunday, Van Persie (left) failed to offer much in attack for Manchester United . Most of Van Persie's work came from the right hand side against West Ham on Sunday . Despite scoring at home to Leicester, the Dutchman's heat map shows he had little involvement in play . Perhaps his team-mates have not aided his cause this season or last, but Van Persie has not bailed them out of trouble, either. He has one goal – the opener in a comfortable 3-1 home victory over Leicester – in his last seven matches. The ‘partnership’ with Falcao barely merits such description and the pair were again out of sync at Upton Park. Even under mentor and compatriot Van Gaal, Van Persie’s body language betrays what appears to be frustration – be that with himself or the system. Van Persie (right) has scored nine goals this term - with his last strike coming at home to Leicester in January . Van Persie (right) scored 26 league goals in his debut United campaign as they won the 2012-13 title . Wayne Rooney (20 apps, eight goals, four assists) The problem for Rooney, it seems, is that Van Gaal has made him something of a project, using the re-positioning of the captain to prove his skill as master manager. Rooney, of course, has spoken positively of his new midfield berth, but what else would he say? Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher was not happy with the deployment of Rooney during the draw at West Ham. Wayne Rooney (centre) was used out of position again for United as they drew 1-1 at West Ham . Rooney (left) was played on right of a narrow diamond midfield formation - instead of his natural role up front . Rooney (right) cut a frustrated figure at times during the match and was booked for dissent on Sunday . ‘I was watching Wayne Rooney today and the position he’s in is not right,’ Carragher said. ‘Rooney has got to get back up front, that’s his best position, or, in this system, you’d want him behind the front two.’ The numbers support Carragher’s concern. From 11 midfield outings he has scored just three times and is now without a goal in his last eight matches. In attack, his record reads far more favourably – five goals from nine games. Rooney's heat map against West Ham shows the 29-year-old was largely deployed on the right . In January's win against Leicester, Rooney was highly effective in midfield but didn't charge forward in attack . Rooney's heat map in a 2-0 win at QPR last month also shows his little productiveness in the opposition box . Given Rooney’s nature and thirst for goals and glory, it won’t be long before frustration kicks in, and that in turn will unsettle the team. If Rooney is United’s best striker – and the numbers would suggest he is – then that is where he should play. Van Gaal’s persistence with his midfield experiment is counter-productive, to the team and the individual. Rooney (centre) scored on the opening day against Swansea - where he was played in attack by Van Gaal . James Wilson (11 apps, one goal, no assists) Talent clearly resides within the 19-year-old and his involvement, in some sense, must be applauded. But is it too soon? Should he not be on loan in the Championship - scoring goals and chasing promotion in much the same manner as Chelsea’s Patrick Bamford at Middlesbrough. James Wilson (centre) is highly-rated by Van Gaal but has been used as a substitute mainly this season . Wilson (second right) scored in his last game as United beat Cambridge 3-0 in a FA Cup fourth round replay . While he is bright and purposeful and undoubtedly gaining invaluable experience with every minute, a return of one league goal has done little to convince he is ready for the senior stage at United. What he does inject, however, is an energy all too absent when Falcao and Van Persie are paired. But does that not say more about United’s offensive struggles that a rookie frontman is at times a better bet than the those senior stars? Wilson could well mature into United’s next No9 and there is a raw enthusiasm about him which has its part to play amid their current toil. But to rely on the teenager would be asking too much. Rather, his comrades need to step up. Overall this campaign Wilson has scored twice in 15 appearances in all competitions for United .","Manchester United drew 1-1 at West Ham in the Premier League .

"If things hadn't turned out quite so magical during a trip to the Home of Golf last October, this festive period would have been an agonising one for Oli Wilson. The season of giving had been earmarked to talk honestly with his wife Lauren about what the sport had brutally stripped away - and what to do next. 'It was going to be the big moment, and whether I took a break from golf or even whether I stopped doing it altogether,' said the 34-year-old from Nottingham. Oliver Wilson poses with his wife Lauren at St Andrews after winning the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship . Wilson, pictured in action at St Andrews, is now looking forward to proving himself on the European Tour . Lauren plants a kiss on her husband's lips after his stunning victory on The Old Course in early October . 'My slump had gone on for so long it had got to the stage where I couldn't keep doing it. My results were terrible, I was playing with people on the Challenge Tour who didn't know I was quite good once who were thinking: ""He's rubbish"". It had become embarrassing.' Now, thanks to his incredible victory at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, he's swapped all the negativity for rubbing shoulders with the Rorys, the Justins and the Henriks once more. Instead of contemplating another profession, he can pore over the European Tour schedule and pick the glamour places to play. 'Christmas will certainly have a different tone for Lauren and myself,' he said, smiling. Remember Oli, the good guy who appeared to have the world at his feet? Back in 2008, he was good enough to be a member of Europe's Ryder Cup team. The following year he finished seventh in the Order of Merit. How on earth could it go so badly wrong? But it did. Over the next four years his Race to Dubai ranking plummeted from 48th to 130th to 137th to 236th. Wilson gets another kiss from his caddie after ending his wait for a win on the European Tour . Wilson celebrates after holing a decisive putt for Europe during the 2008 Ryder Cup at Valhalla . Wilson, pictured in action at the Madeira Islands Open in 2012, was forced to return to the Challenge Tour . 'The low point was last year in terms of the way I was playing,' he said. 'I was not coming close to making cuts on the Challenge Tour, never mind the main tour. I was snap-hooking it off the tee and it was horrific. I was reduced to hitting a driver off the deck because if I teed it up it went off the planet. Even hitting it in the rough was progress.' What happened this year might have been mentally worse. 'I started to tee it up again because I knew there was no way back to the big stage if I didn't,' he said. 'I got my game back in OK shape but the transition of getting any confidence was horrible. My swing would look good on the video but on the course it was still rubbish.' That was when he put a big circle around Christmas as the time to decide whether it was worth carrying on. 'Part of it was financial,' he admitted. 'I'd made a bit of money during the good years but how long can you keep going when you're earning nothing and it's costing two grand a week to play? 'Basically, you're gambling on yourself and I'd lost that gamble for three years. How long was I prepared to keep on gambling?' Wilson reacts on the 18th green at St Andrews after winning the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship . The 34-year-old proudly holds his trophy after sealing a shock victory in Scotland earlier this year . In September, Wilson was faced with the decision that would change his life. 'I'd got an invitation to play in the Alfred Dunhill Links, which was very nice of them, but I was genuinely in two minds as to whether to accept,' he said. 'I thought I might be better off sticking to the Challenge Tour and earning playing rights for the main tour that way. But I wasn't really enjoying the Challenge Tour, so why not play in a big event and give myself a shot of adrenaline? You can go on about the bad decisions you make and I certainly made plenty during my three poor years. But that was one of the best decisions I've ever made.' Wilson arrived in Scotland greatly encouraged by some coaching advice from Robert Rock, who runs his own driving range in his spare time and loves teaching almost as much as he does playing. Even so, Wilson had no great expectations. 'If you'd offered me a top-30 finish I'd have bitten your hand off,' he said. 'Even when I led after the first round I was still thinking in terms of making the halfway cut. Then I led by three shots after three rounds and now I'm thinking a top-10 gets me into the field for Portugal the following week.' How does a player who has fallen all the way to 792nd in the world keep all the demons at bay, with the golfing world now enthralled? His nearest challenger was none other than Rory McIlroy. Rory McIlroy, pictured during the final round of the Alfred Dunhill Links (left), was rooting for Wilson . McIlroy ended up finished tied second at St Andrews as Wilson secured victory by just a single shot . Halfway through the final round, the world No 1 crossed a fairway to talk to Oli and tell him he was rooting for him. 'That was so good of Rory, I think we all know he's a class act,' said Wilson. 'But it was all the struggles I'd been through that really helped down the stretch. For three years people had been telling me that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and, to be honest, I'd never believed it. But it was true during those last nine holes.' At the 16th and 17th Wilson played two of the gutsiest shots struck all year. The man who had never won on tour, even during the good years when he amassed nine runner-up finishes, was on the brink. There was still one more moment of agony, as fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood had a 12ft birdie putt on the 18th to tie. But when it slipped by all the emotion came pouring out. In the recorder's hut he hugged his wife and the tears fell freely. Wilson admits he considered quitting golf but he is now looking forward to a bright future . It says everything about the popular Wilson that a sport rose to applaud as one. 'Mind you, I don't know what the guys on the Challenge Tour must have been thinking,' he said with a huge grin on his face. As he says himself, in 72 fairytale holes, Wilson moved up about five levels. Instead of a visit to the qualifying school last month, he played in the four-event Final Series. Not only did the £500,000 first prize wipe out three years of debts, he can look to a future filled with possibility once more. 'I definitely feel capable of going further than I did,' he says. 'The standard has gone up massively in the three years I've been away. It's such an exciting time.' None more so than for the man who thought he'd lost it all.","Oliver Wilson won the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in October .

"By . Dinesh C Sharma . Updated: . 03:28 EST, 23 January 2012 . Almost two and a half decades after entering the supercomputing race but losing ground thereafter, India is now rebooting with a vengeance. The government has discreetly embarked upon a billiondollar initiative to create next-generation supercomputers. But unlike the `1,750 ($35) tablet PC, which is unfolding under the glare of high-voltage publicity, the supercomputing programme is shrouded in secrecy. So much so, the plan details have not yet been shared with scientists who have developed such mega machines in the past. The government has committed `5,000 crore (nearly $1billion) for the plan, making it the largest ever grant for a single research programme since Independence. The money is likely to start flowing during the 12th five-year plan period. Super: A series of supercomputers titled PARAM was launched by the CDAC, Pune . The only jarring aspect of the project is that its reins are being handed over to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, which has only been a user and not a designer or developer of supercomputers. India had begun its foray in supercomputing nearly 25 years ago after the U.S. denied it a supercomputer meant for weather research. When the first Indian supercomputer, PARAM, was launched in 1991, India was only the third country in the world to possess supercomputing power after the U.S. and Japan. China joined the race 10 years later than India but surpassed it soon. The current initiative, conceived in the Prime Minister's Office and nurtured by the Planning Commission, is a direct response to the Chinese challenge. Currently, Indian supercomputers are at a teraflop stage. This means they can perform several trillion floating point operations per second. China, Japan and the U.S. have already achieved petaflop capability. Such supercomputers are able to perform a thousand trillion floating point operations per second. Committed: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is determined that India should catch up . These countries have also begun work . on the next level - exascale - to develop machines with the capacity of . an exaflop or one million teraflops. In . order to remain in the race, India would first need to develop a . petaflop machine and then aim for exascale. When contacted, Dr T. Ramasami, secretary, department of science and technology, confirmed the . development, revealing that the programme had been conceived with a . view 'to position India strongly in supercomputing' and would be . implemented in mission mode. A detailed project report was ready and loose ends, if any, would be tied up soon. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced at the Indian Science Congress at Bhubaneswar in Odisha that the IISc would spearhead the project. 'All knowledge institutions would be linked, but will be coordinated by the IISc,' Ramasami elaborated. While the decision to rejoin the race could be a good strategic move, the choice of IISc as the leader of this ambitious programme has left experts baffled. The institute has never planned, designed and developed supercomputers in the past. In fact, its supercomputer centre is mostly focused on academic research and education. The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) - it has developed a series of supercomputers, including PARAM, and already prepared a roadmap for a petaflop machine - would strangely have to play second fiddle to the IISc. Other scientific agencies such as those working in the fields of defence, atomic energy, space and aerospace labs, too, have proven expertise in supercomputer design and architecture. In the private sector, Eka - a supercomputer developed by Tata's Computational Research Laboratories - became the world's fourth most powerful system in 2007. First of the few: The Indian Institute of Science (IISC) Campus in Bangalore . 'We lost ground to late entrants such as . China only because of inadequate investment and a fragmented approach . to supercomputing. And when the government is ready to invest, it has . decided to make a non-player the captain of the game,' a leading . scientist, who has been involved in developing supercomputers, said. The government, he added, had overlooked indigenous design expertise developed over the past 25 years. Supercomputer consists of thousands of integrated computersin a single room. They can solve complex problems in astrophysics, climate modeling, etc.Its power is measured by howmany floating point operations or‘flops’ it can complete per secondA teraflop is one trillion floating point operations per second. This measure describes multiplicationsthat can be performed per secondPARAM Padma, built by CDAC in 2002, reached the peak of 1 teraflop performance. Eka, developed by the CRL, achieved 117.9 teraflop in 2007A petaflop is the next level of computing, which indicates a processing speed of one thousandtrillion flop . Japan’s K computer achieves 10 petaflopsThe current summit of supercomputing is achieving the exascale or capacity of an exaflop -one quintillion flops. The U.S.,Japan and China are working onexascale machinesIn 2007, India & China had ninesupercomps in the Top 500 list.In 2011, India had only two whileChina’s shot up to 74 in the list . 'The IISc has its own strengths, but somehow it doesn't spring to mind as the first choice for the nodal agency,' Anand Parthasarathy, formerly a scientist in the supercomputing team of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), felt. He is currently the editor of IndiaTechOnline.com. The idea of bringing back India into the mainstream of high performance computing, he said, could be best implemented through a consortium of agencies such as CDAC, DRDO, BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) and Tata's CRL. All of them have proven expertise in designing and developing supercomputers. 'They should come together in an ""ego-less"" public-private alliance to pool their strengths and deliver a truly Indian platform for exascale computing,' Parthasarathy added. After China emerged a global leader in supercomputing in 2010, sources said the pioneer of CDAC supercomputers, Dr Vijay Bhatkar, had shared a blueprint on 'Building Exascale Supercomputing Capability' with government agencies. The plan had mentioned an investment of Rs 500 crore to build a petascale facility in two years and Rs 5000 crore for reaching the exascale capacity by 2020. Bhatkar, however, did not comment on the latest development. 'Right now, we are in the dark about what the PM's initiative is all about. No timelines, responsibilities and technological options have been revealed to anyone. Such a large scientific programme should be carried out in an open, transparent manner and should be peer-reviewed,' a Bangalore- based scientist said.",China's advance spurs government to commit biggest ever research grant .
"In the hometown of The Greatest, it seemed only appropriate to talk about 12 rounds. Twelve rounds of golf that have changed the sport’s landscape entirely and will go down in the annals as creating a new standard for the European game. Spread over three tournaments, what began in bright sunlight on the ancient links at Hoylake at The Open in July ended on Sunday in darkness on the modern stadium course at Valhalla in Louisville. Rory McIlroy went into those trio of events with doubts about his ability to play the most venerable form of the game; with freaky Fridays swirling his conscience. VIDEO Scroll down to watch The Open Championship highlights . Man of the moment: Rory McIlroy parades the Wanamaker Trophy and Claret Jug on his Instagram account . Job done: Rory McIlroy celebrates his dramatic victory in the darkness in Valhalla on Sunday evening . VIDEO The Open Championship highlights . He ends them the complete player, having shown a mastery of every shot and emotion. The only players he will ever be compared to again are Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. While he will surely never reach the majors total of the former, or assume quite the level of dominance of the latter, he might actually have more strings to his bow than either. For even the two guardians of the record books had weaknesses. Nicklaus was never a great chipper or bunker player while Woods never won a major coming from behind on the final day. But where is Rory’s weakness, after these 12 rounds? At Hoylake he showed his ability to learn an alien form, for links play was never his forte; at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, a prowess to dominate an event from start to finish. And then at Valhalla came the gossamer touch and all the guts and heart a golfer can display. Pure theatre: The US PGA Championship ended in virtual darkness following the earlier rain delay . McIlroy went into the stretch as a two-time major champion and ends it having doubled his haul and claimed his first WGC title. He has now pulled alongside the likes of Raymond Floyd and Ernie Els on the all-time majors list with seemingly all his best years to come. He played those 12 rounds in a cumulative total of 48 under, never once going over par and only once — in the final round of The Open, where he shot 71 — did he fail to break 70. It is worth printing in mind-boggling sequence, for we may never see the like again, given the stature of the tournaments they were delivered in: 66, 66, 68, 71, 69, 64, 66, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68. The weekend we have just witnessed is right up there with any major you care to mention. It boiled down to four ball strikers performing close to the peak of their powers. We had a five-time major champion in Phil Mickelson; Henrik Stenson rewinding the clock a year and Rickie Fowler hoping to show that while the future might be Rory green, it will have a fairly prominent hue of orange. Eyes on the prize: McIlroy will now only ever be compared to Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods after his latest win . When the back nine began, McIlroy trailed Fowler and Stenson by three strokes and Mickelson by two. He was out of sorts and looking fatigued after his wondrous stretch of form. Hope was fading as fast as the light. They say the hardest thing is leading a tournament from start to finish but being able to shift momentum over the back nine on Sunday might come close. After a good drive on the par five 10th, McIlroy still had 284 yards to reach the green. If truth be told, on these saturated fairways, if he had flushed it he wouldn’t have reached. But he caught it a fraction thin, causing it to roll on impact, and when the ball stopped it was just seven feet from the flag. Talk about a shot that changed everything. After the resultant eagle he could have birdied the next two holes, then did seize an opportunity at the 13th. At the 15th he holed from 20ft to put enormous pressure on the other three. Come here, you: Rory celebrates with his father Gerry McIlroy after winning the US PGA Championship . Superior technique and belief told on the final holes. The 16th is a monstrous par four and it showed, as the two Americans flailed wildly. Mickelson ran up his first bogey in 22 holes. Fowler, who had bogeyed the 14th, was fortunate not to pay a similar price. McIlroy? He drilled his tee shot so far it finished 17 yards further than anyone else managed on that hole. Mickelson went for the green with a wood; McIlroy had a nine iron. He had another at the 17th from a fairway bunker and played it so beautifully it set up another birdie. Two strokes ahead with just the par five 18th to negotiate. They drove off and then allowed McIlroy and his playing partner Bernd Wiesberger to play their teeshots. Here, McIlroy got his second piece of luck. Without the deluge that had caused a suspension and provoked the desperate race against time to finish, his ball would have plunged into a creek; instead it stayed on the bank. Elation: McIlroy ranks as the third most successful European golfer in majors. Only Seve Ballesteros (five) and Sir Nick Faldo (six) have won more . The two Yankee gentlemen allowed McIlroy to play his second shot as well, which finished in a greenside bunker. Mickelson now had to hole an eagle pitch and came mighty close. Fowler, unable to see clearly, cruelly lipped out from short range for a birdie. He is just the third man alongside Woods and Nicklaus (those two again) to finish in the top five in all four majors in the same season — but the only one not to win one. McIlroy came out of the sand and had two putts from 25ft to win. Normally, it would have been routine, although not when you can barely see a hand in front of you. But he pulled it off and let out a roar of elation. At the prize presentation, Ted Bishop, the PGA of America president, dropped the lid of the massive Wanamaker Trophy — but trust Rory to stoop with all the reflexes of a slip fielder and catch it. So ended the 12 rounds of greatness. Next year the majors are at his two favourite courses — Augusta and St Andrews — while the PGA is at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin, where he was third in 2010. Do you think there might be a bit of interest as he heads to the Masters in April, halfway to the Rory Slam and seeking to become only the sixth player to win all four majors? Do feel free to join the ride if you’re not a golfer. All that is needed is an appreciation for someone doing something extraordinarily well. We’re in Roger Federer territory here, or Lionel Messi. And the most glorious thing of all? He has only just begun. Good save: McIlroy dives in to catch the lid of the Wanamaker Trophy after Ted Bishop let it slip .","McIlroy will now only be compared to Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods .

"All England have to do, it seems, to go a long way in the World Cup is play anyone other than Australia. They romped to an emphatic nine-wicket victory over an awful West Indies here at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the first of two warm-up games that are supposed to provide preparation for the big challenges ahead. Instead England would have gained little other than a confidence boost from thrashing opponents who looked even more uninterested than the India side who sleepwalked their way through the Tri-series. Chris Woakes (right) is congratulated by team-mate Chris Jordan after his five-wicket haul . Woakes led the England team off after his five-wicket haul reduced the West Indies to 122 all out . Steven Finn also offered his congratulations to Woakes following his excellent performance . At the centre of the walkover was Chris Woakes, who went wicketless while conceding 89 runs against Australia last week but who now bounced back with a five-wicket haul gained at the expense of just 19 as West Indies were bundled out for 122 in under 30 overs. Ian Bell then led England home in company with James Taylor in the most comfortable of run chases after Moeen Ali, reprieved when caught off a Jason Holder no ball on seven, had hit 46 off 43 balls. West Indies bad attitude was summed up by the fact that Chris Gayle, who hardly exerted himself when he was dismissed by his first ball, did not bother taking to the field for England's reply. England have now won five out of eight matches on this tour but the trouble is that the three defeats have all come against an Australian side who will start as hot favourites for this World Cup that begins in Melbourne on Saturday.

Jordan (second right) celebrates with his team-mates after taking the wicket of Denesh Ramdin . Ian Bell plays a shot as England successfully chased down the Windies total of 122 for a nine-wicket win . Still, if England continue the habit of dismissing inferior opposition then they can afford to lose at the MCG and still exceed expectations which saw them dismissed as complete no-hopers before they came here a month ago. This was a quite dreadful performance from West Indies. They simply did not appear to have any heart for the battle under cloudy Sydney skies and with the greenish pitch offering seam movement and a little bounce. That was no real excuse for some of the pathetic shots played by a West Indies team who on days like this are little short of an embarrassment to a region with such a rich and proud cricketing heritage. All, of course, is not well with the modern day West Indies. They quit their tour of India in October over a pay dispute and have arrived here without two of their best players in Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard as a consequence. Woakes also removed opener Dwayne Smith for 21 runs as England stamped their authority . Jordan appeals for a leg before wicket decision against Denesh Ramdin . Finn bowls Marlon Samuels for 10 runs as the West Indies collapsed to 122 all out in Sydney . England celebrate after Chris Gayle is caught by Jos Buttler off the bowling of Woakes for a duck . Andre Russell reaches for his sunglasses during the match in Sydney . Even their opening press conference here on Sunday was a tetchy affair with their normally affable media manager stepping in to stop innocuous questions to their new and very raw young captain Jason Holder about Gayle. They will have to bat a lot better than this if they are to avoid falling victims to the ‘minnows’ in their World Cup group in Ireland, Zimbabwe and the UAE. On this form a quarter-final place is far from certain for West Indies. The tone was set at the off when Woakes, mauled by Australia in his last outing eight days ago, took two wickets with successive balls in the first over, Gayle and Darren Bravo both being undone by a little extra bounce. This was an important day for Woakes, who has had a good winter but who risks losing the new ball to Stuart Broad when the World Cup begins in front of 90,000 on Saturday. West Indies certainly had much more difficulty in playing the Warwickshire man than Australia did in the Tri-series final in Perth, with only Lendl Simmons displaying any degree of permanence. West Indies batsman Lendl Simmons tries to lead the fightback - he made 45 before being dismissed . Jonathan Carter is bowled by James Tredwell for seven runs as the Windies slumped to 67-6 at that point . Woakes was the standout England bowler as they made light work of the West Indies in Sydney . Moeen Ali hits out as England set off on their run chase of 123 at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Bell plays a shot as England easily reached their victory target for the loss of only one wicket . Simmons did hit one huge six into the famous SCG pavilion off James Tredwell, who had bowled Jonathan Carter with his first ball, but fell five runs short of his half century when he became one of Woakes' five victims. Perhaps the worst of a catalogue of poor shots came from Marlon Samuels, who played all round a straight ball from Steven Finn, who was not at his best and was perhaps flattered by taking two wickets. Other than Finn, England bowled well in the absence of the rested Broad and Jimmy Anderson, with both Tredwell and Chris Jordan taking the chances presented them by gaining practice against pliable opponents. There were also an important seven overs for Ravi Bopara who, according to coach Peter Moores, had ‘not taken’ the bowling opportunities presented to him so far on tour and came into this warm-up under a little pressure. There were no such concerns here, with Bell finishing unbeaten on 35, and England can only hope for a more testing time when they face Pakistan here on Wednesday. Then it is the small matter of Australia again when it will really count.","England defeated the West Indies by nine wickets in World Cup warm-up .

"Among the five American troops killed this week during a friendly fire airstrike in Afghanistan were a soldier from northern Illinois who deployed a month after his father died and a soldier from Ohio who was engaged to be married. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said the five American troops were killed Monday 'during a security operation in southern Afghanistan. Officials said an airstrike was called in after the unit was ambushed by the Taliban. It is one of the deadliest friendly fire incidents in nearly 13 years of war. One of those killed was Aaron Toppen, 19, family spokeswoman Jennie Swartz told The Associated Press from the family's Mokena home, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago. Another was Justin Helton, 25. Scroll down for videos . Tragic: Justin Helton, 25, of Ohio, (left) and Aaron Toppen, 19, of Illinois, (right) are among the five American servicemen who were killed in a friendly fire airstrike . Helton's family says he was engaged to be married when he was killed. He had been in Afghanistan for just two months . Toppen, pictured here with his girlfriend, always wanted to be a soldier, his sister said: 'My brother lost his life doing what he always wanted to do since he was a little boy' The other three casualties have not been named. Swartz said representatives from the U.S. Army came to the door of Toppen's mother, Pam Toppen, in the middle of the night to deliver the news. Military representatives also went to the home of Justin Helton's parents in Beaver, Ohio, early Tuesday to inform them of their son's death, a relative said. Mindy Helton said her cousin specialized in dealing with explosives and was based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Helton had been in Afghanistan about two months and was engaged to be married, she said. He had been in the Army since 2010. Toppen was the youngest of three children. 'At midnight last night my moms . doorbell rang and we received the news that my little brother was one of . the five involved in friendly fire in Afghanistan,' his sister Amanda . Gralewski wrote on Facebook. 'My brother lost his life doing what he always wanted to do since he was a little boy.' Toppen was from Mokena, a suburb 35 miles southwest of downtown Chicago. As Toppen's family and friends gathered at the home, painted a light blue, his uncle, Jack Winter, described the high school graduate as a caring and funny man who had aspired to a career in the military or law enforcement. Toppen's family says they were informed Monday night that he had been killed in a friendly-fire incident in Afghanistan . 'Aaron was predisposed to serve. He was very keen to be in the military,' Winter said. 'He was quite proud to be there.' 'He . was something somewhat rare in youth culture today. ... In a word, I . would summarize what he had as ""class,""' Winter added. 'So rarely now do . you see somebody like that who truly does have class who's polite, . humble, loyal, who's a kind-hearted soul, generous.' It . was the second death of a loved one for the family this year. Toppen . was set to leave for Afghanistan in February, but his gravely ill father . died that month and he stayed for the funeral. He deployed in March. Toppen . was a graduate of Lincoln-Way East High in Frankfort, Illinois, and . loved the outdoors, especially fishing. Family members at the home — . where friends continued to stop by and bring food Tuesday evening — . circulated a picture of Toppen as a young child sitting next to his . father in a fishing boat. Military members provided few details of the attack to the family, Winter said. Helton was an explosives disposal technician based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He had been in the Army since 2010 . 'A . military representative came to my sister's home ... and broke her . heart,' Winter said. 'It just tears your world apart. That's the . situation my sister is in.' The Taliban claimed responsibility for Monday's ambush in Zabul. A . Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place between . foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district, and a . ""huge number"" of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims. Pentagon reports say the troops were all . special operations, though Toppen's Facebook page says he is in the . regular U.S. Army infantry. Fox News . reported that the aircraft in question is a B-1 Lancer, a strategic . Cold War-era bomber that can carry a payload of up to 125,000 pounds of . explosives. 'Five American . troops were killed yesterday during a security operation in southern . Afghanistan. Investigators are looking into the likelihood that friendly . fire was the cause. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of . these fallen,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. If confirmed, it would be one of the most serious cases involving coalition-on-coalition friendly fire during the war. 'The casualties occurred during a security operation when their unit came into contact with enemy forces. Tragically, there is the possibility that fratricide may have been involved. The incident is under investigation,' the coalition said in an earlier announcement. One of the worst such incidents came in April 2002 when four Canadian soldiers were killed by an American F-16 jet fighter which dropped a bomb on a group of troops during night firing exercise in southern Kandahar. A senior police official in southern Zabul said the coalition soldiers were killed when they called for close air support. The deadly airstrike happened in southern Zabul Province as American troops were leading security missions in the run-up to the Afghan elections . Provincial police chief Gen. Ghulam Sakhi Rooghlawanay said there was a joint operation by Afghan and NATO troops in the area's Arghandab district early Monday. After that operation was over, the troops came under attack from the Taliban and called in air support, he said. 'After the operation was over on the way back, the joint forces came under the attack of insurgents, and then foreign forces called for air support. Unfortunately five NATO soldiers and one Afghan army officer were killed mistakenly by NATO air strike,' Rooghlawanay said. There was no way to independently confirm Rooghlawanay's comments. The coalition would not comment and NATO headquarters in Brussels also declined to comment. The only U.S. troops now involved in combat operations are usually Special Operations Forces that mentor their Afghan counterparts. They often come under fire and are responsible for calling in air support when needed. Because of constraints placed by outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai, such air strikes are usually called 'in extremis,' or when troops fear they are about to be killed. Karzai blamed a similar airstrike called in by special forces mentoring an Afghan operation for killing a dozen civilians during an operation in northern Parwan province. The U.S. military vehemently denied the charge, saying that two civilians were killed in crossfire with Taliban militants and that airstrike was called in when forces thought they were about to be killed by insurgents. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack against the joint force in Zabul. Deadly airstrike: A U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancer bomber (like the one pictured) reportedly dropped the bombs that killed the U.S. troops Monday night . A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place on Monday night between foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district. Ahmadi claimed a 'huge number' of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims. Separately, a NATO statement said a service member died Monday as a result of a non-battle injury in eastern Afghanistan. The deaths bring to 36 the number of NATO soldiers killed so far this year in Afghanistan, with eight service members killed in June. The insurgents have intensified attacks on Afghan and foreign forces ahead of the country's presidential election runoff Saturday. Officials are concerned there could be more violence around the time of the vote, although the first round in April passed relatively peacefully. Casualties have been falling in the U.S.-led military coalition as its forces pull back to allow the Afghan army and police to fight the Taliban insurgency. All combat troops are scheduled to be withdrawn from the country by the end of this year.","Deaths on Monday worst single most deadly incident since helicopter crash on April 26 .

"Michael Bradley led the United States to a 2-0 victory against Panama in Los Angeles on Sunday in spectacular fashion - by scoring the opening goal directly from a corner kick. Bradley's goal came in the 27th minute, as he looped the ball perfectly over Panama goalkeeper Jaime Penedo and perfectly into the far corner of the net.

"Nigel Pearson's job as manager of Leicester City appears to have been doing the hokey cokey where one moment he's in, and the next he's out. The club sitting bottom of the Barclays Premier League issued a statement on Sunday night, insisting they had not sacked Pearson following his altercation with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur. Even members of Pearson's backroom staff were told he'd been fired after grabbing McArthur by the throat in what is surely among the strangest touchline meltdowns in Premier League history. But how does it compare? Sportsmail pick five touchline bust-ups between managers and players. Nigel Pearson was involved in a bizarre incident with Crystal Palace's James McArthur on Saturday .

Pearson also grabbed hold of McArthur's shirt as the midfielder tried to get back on the pitch . Alan Pardew headbutts David Meyler, 2014 . If we needed to compile a list for bust-ups between managers, Pardew would feature. If we needed examples for bust-ups between managers and officials, Pardew would feature. Yet again, in scraps between managers and players, Pardew is never far away. The then-Newcastle United boss was sent to the stands after headbutting Hull City's David Meyler at the KC Stadium. He received a £100,000 fine, was given a formal warning by Newcastle and was slapped with a three-match stadium ban with a touchline ban for a further four games by the Football Association. The FA also fined him £60,000 as the now-Crystal Palace manager made history for the wrong reasons. Alan Pardew, then-Newcastle United manager, headbutts Hull City's David Meyler in March 2014 .

You may be thinking 'Who?' but you're more than likely to recognise the video. MSV Duisburg manager Meier had an altercation with Koln player Streit on the touchline during their match. Referee Manuel Grafe sent Streit off with a straight red, only for replays to show it was in fact Meier that went for the headbutt. Still, both went to ground like they'd been shot, play-acting. Meier was sacked by the club two days later, and banned by the German FA for three months from any managerial activities. Delio Rossi punches and slaps own player Adem Ljajic, 2012 . Fiorentina manager Rossi launched slaps and punches at his own player Ljajic in 2012 after the midfielder was substituted just half hour into their 2-2 draw with Novara. Ljajic, once on trial at Manchester United, appeared to sarcastically clap Rossi's decision to take him off - bad move. Rossi responded by attacking his player, having to be restrained by his own staff. Rossi apologised for his part in the fight afterwards. 'My gesture was ugly, disgraceful and I am very saddened,' he said. 'I have never said that I am a saint but you can ask the children and all the players that I have coached in the past what type of person I am. I have never allowed myself to hit anyone, not even my children.'

Paolo di Canio is never far from controversy, and the Swindon manager got into a scrap with his own player Leon Clarke down the tunnel in 2011. It started on the pitch where Clarke got into an argument with fitness coach Claudio Donatelli. Di Canio intervened, only to pick a fight himself. They rowed as they entered the tunnel, before it turned ugly. Afterwards, Di Canio said Clarke would never play for Swindon again. 'Fortunately, he's out now even if he's under contract. He's never going to play with my team, never,' Di Canio insisted. Paolo di Canio exchanges words with his Swindon player Leon Clarke on the touchline in 2011 .

"Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne claims the return of Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian to the SPFL Premiership cannot come soon enough. Speaking after the Pittodrie club did a deal to wipe out their £14.5 million debt at their AGM on Monday night, Milne claimed it would be easier to attract sponsors to the flagship league with the biggest clubs there. Aberdeen’s turnover for last season was up to £11.158m from £7.85m the previous year but they still made a small operating loss. Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne wants to see the return of the Scottish heavyweights to the SPFL . And, in an eyebrow-raising claim, the Dons chief insists most Aberdeen fans want a resumption of their bitter rivalry with Rangers after a period he describes as the most challenging in Scottish football history. ‘We all want to see Rangers, Hibs and Hearts back up in the top league again and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later,’ said Milne. ‘Without any question it would be easier to attract significant sponsorship back to our game with these clubs in the Premiership. ‘There’s no doubt that it makes the game an easier sell if we have all the major clubs competing in the same division. Rangers confirmed on Monday that manager Ally McCoist had resigned from the club . ‘Some fans like seeing big teams struggling, but I think the majority want to see their team going to Tynecastle, Ibrox and Easter Road again. ‘I’m sure our supporters want to see Rangers back at Pittodrie after what has been the most challenging period in Scottish football’s history in the last few years. It’s happened at a time when it’s been the most challenging time economically for the country as a whole which has put additional strain on the clubs. ‘I think there is a bit of stability in the game lately and we can be hopeful about things moving forward.’ At the recent SFA Convention in Glasgow, sports promoter Barry Hearn launched a verbal attack on the SPFL hierarchy for their failure to land blue chip sponsors. Championship leaders Hearts are progressing well both on and off the pitch . Defending league figureheads, however, Milne said: ‘People have to put in context what Barry Hearn said recently as it is always easy for someone to fly in and make statements, then fly off again. ‘It’s a totally different thing to live with it and make things happen in a tough environment. ‘There will be pressures on in the months ahead to do whatever we can to bring more money into the game at a national level, as well as at the individual clubs. But having those big teams back in the top flight would certainly be a help towards that.’ Milne used the AGM to promise progress on a new training complex for the club. Plans for a new stadium at Loirston Loch will be also be revived. As the Rangers future of Ally McCoist hangs in the balance, however, Milne also vowed to do his utmost to hang on to League Cup-winning manager Derek McInnes. ‘We have achieved a lot lately and the major factor in that has been the impact Derek has made since coming into the club,’ he said. Hibernian chief executive Leeann Dempster says a deal to put the club in the black is not close . ‘What happens on the pitch gives us momentum and is the driving force for everything else. ‘A lot of the groundwork for our plans was done a while back but not doing as much as a club like Aberdeen needs to be doing on the pitch makes it extremely difficult. ‘But it’s part and parcel of football that a successful manager will attract attention from elsewhere and we know we have to work hard to keep Derek here. ‘However, I think that Derek would be the first to admit that when he took on the job he was taking on a big task. ‘He wasn’t coming in to be a one or two-year wonder as he has just started something at Aberdeen. ‘We made really good progress on that journey in the last 18 months but he knows there is still a long way to go. ‘I have no reason not to believe anything other than the fact that Derek has every intention of seeing that through. ‘There are a whole new set of opportunities for everyone at the club and as a board we have to do what we can to help the manager keep making that progress to where we want to be.’","Stewart Milne is chairman of Aberdeen .

"Ronny Deila fears Celtic will eventually be forced to play a game behind closed doors if delinquent fans continue to put them in the UEFA dock. Europe’s governing body have opened another disciplinary case against the Scottish champions following crowd disorder during the Europa League match against Dinamo Zagreb last week. Visiting fans set off a firework and reportedly clashed with riot police during the 4-3 loss in Croatia. UEFA have confirmed their disciplinary panel will judge the case on February 19 - the same day Celtic host Inter Milan in the first leg of their Europa League knockout tie. Celtic supporters wave flags and spark flares ahead of the match at the Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb . Celtic fans set off a firework and reportedly clashed with riot police during the 4-3 loss in Croatia . Celtic manager Ronny Deila has warned the delinquent Celtic fans that their behaviour is harming the club . It is the fifth time in three years Celtic have faced charges as a result of supporters’ behaviour during European matches. Deila feels if such behavour isn’t brought to an abrupt halt, the club will be forced to play in an empty stadium. ‘It is very sad if this is the consequence because 99 per cent are very good supporters with a very good reputation - and that one per cent we have to stop,’ Deila said. ‘Because if that (a closed stadium) could be the end product, that is not good for the club or Scottish football. If you continue making the same mistakes you will get consequences.’ Marco Pjaca (centre) scored superb hat-trick for Dinamo Zagbreb that condemned  Celtic to a 4-3 loss . Asked if there was much more the club could do, Deila replied: ‘That’s very hard for the club to control. That’s the responsibility of the supporters and the supporters clubs. ‘We need to be finished with it and concentrate on football. It’s about values and how we want other nations and teams and people to look at Celtic. It’s been fantastic for so many years and 99.9 per cent is good now as well. That’s one of the biggest things about Celtic – the supporters – and we have to keep up that reputation.’ Last year the club was fined £42,000 after fans displayed an ‘illicit’ banner at a Champions League clash with AC Milan. Earlier that season, UEFA fined them £4,221 after fireworks were set off during a qualifier with Cliftonville. Celtic players look dejected after conceding another goal, despite the result being ultimately meaningless . During the 2011/12 Europa League campaign, Celtic were fined £21,000 for an offensive banner and setting off of flares at Udinese and £13,000 for ‘illicit chanting’ against Rennes. Celtic denounced the behaviour of the one fan they said was responsible for the flare - and urged supporters to take more responsibility. A statement read: ‘Around 1,200 Celtic supporters enjoyed an excellent visit to Zagreb and were welcomed warmly by the city, enjoying a very friendly atmosphere. It is extremely disappointing therefore that the actions of one individual have had such a negative impact. ‘There can be absolutely no excuse for the use of flares or any other pyrotechnics. The threat to the health and safety of supporters caused by their use in football grounds is well known and we have repeatedly asked for this practice to stop. ‘The small handful of individuals who have been involved in behaviour of this kind in Zagreb and on other occasions have done nothing but embarrass the Club and tarnish the excellent and hard-earned reputation of Celtic supporters. ‘We try to do all we can to stop such behaviour, however, we can only do so much - people must take responsibility. Clearly we will deal with any individuals identified in the strongest terms.’ Meanwhile, Deila remains hopeful that John Guidetti, who will train with the first-team squad for the first time today since picking up a minor knee injury against St Mirren, can be a permanent Celtic player before the Inter tie. ‘We’re talking and have an arrangement with the agent, so it’s going the right way,’ he said.","UEFA have opened another disciplinary case against Celtic .

But a Rangers decision to appeal the matter via an SFA judicial panel will now see the costs of the action spiral as the club wrestle with a growing cash crisis.

"Ajax were gifted victory at Go Ahead Eagles in the Eredivisie on Sunday after their on-loan goalkeeper, Mickey van der Hart, assisted a bizarre own goal for the home side. With the score locked at 1-1, Van der Hart completely missed his kick when receiving a back pass from Wesley Verhoek and allowed the ball to roll into his empty net.

The Amsterdam club had broken the deadlock against The Eagles in the 24th miute with Ricardo Kishna powering down the flank before pulling the ball back to Anwar El Ghazi, who prodded home from close range. Go Ahead leveled midway through the second-half when Sjoerd Overgoor let rip with a shot from 25 yards that flew into the top corner. But just as a draw was looking likely, Van der Hart's error proved costly for the hosts. The gaffe has already become a viral sensation and there are plenty of conspiracy theories doing the rounds on internet message boards as to how convenient the mistake seems for Frank de Boer's side. The theories, however, are purely speculative, and it seems more likely that this was simply another freakish moment in football that those involved will want to forget, but fans will always remember.

"Facebook’s ill-fated purchase of Instagram stumbles from one disaster to the next after new figures revealed that the photo-sharing service has lost almost 50 per cent of its daily users in less than a month. The dramatic drop in traffic has been attributed to an attempt made before Christmas to introduce new terms and conditions which sparked an outcry from users including celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. Instagram’s active daily users – the highest frequency user group – has dropped to 8.42 million this week, from 16.35 million on Dec 17, the day the controversial news broke. User backlash: Instagram's attempt to introduce controversial new terms last month has backfired as the photo-sharing service has lost almost 50 per cent of its daily users in less than a month . Instagram's number of active daily users has almost halved since it announced that it was changing it's usage terms on Dec 17 . Wrong person to mess with: Kim Kardashian was one of a number of celebrities who strongly objected to Instagram's attempt to change it's terms . Instagram, which Facebook acquired in a deal worth $1 billion in April, sparked anger reactions from users when it attempted to introduce new terms of use which suggested it could sell users’ photos to advertisers. The company quickly backtracked on the announcement and reverted to its old terms of use, but not before it received a huge amount of negative publicity. Instagram described the whole matter as a 'misunderstanding.' The active daily user statistics have been compiled by AppStats, which measures app usage by tracking users who are logged into Instagram via Facebook. ‘The . main loss will be most likely due to the terms of service changes, . given how much attention and controversy the terms of service change has . brought, and seeing how clearly the Instagram app dropped after the . terms of service change,' AppStats CEO Sebastian Sujka told The New York . Post. Facebook has been quick to release a statement describing the data as ‘inaccurate’. ‘We continue to see strong and steady growth in both registered and active users of Instagram,' it read. It claims that Instagram has 100 million registered users, but has declined to provide any alternative metrics. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acquired Instagram in a deal worth $1 billion last April . AppData, an alternative measurement service, has also recorded a decline in Instagram usage. It's results show a 25 percent drop in Instagram’s active daily users, to 12.4 million, from 16.4 million from Dec. 19 to 26. Facebook has also called that data 'inaccurate.' The company this week told developers that it is moving away from the daily statistics of the sort that showed Instagram’s slip in favor of less detailed rankings. There was outrage amongst Instagram users in December when it published new terms which appeared to give it rights over all its users' photos and data to promote 'sponsored content'. The terms also included a controversial provision which implied . that if a child under the age of 18 used the service, his or . her parents had tacitly agreed to Instagram's terms. Anyone who did not agree with the new terms was invited to delete their account. But the aggressive strategy failed . when a string of high-profile celebrities users, including reality TV . star Kim Kardashian and actor Seth Green, took to Twitter to say they . would delete their Instagram accounts. The service's celebrity users were . among the many to join a chorus of criticism as a widespread media and . public backlash quickly gathered pace and forced the company to backtrack.","New figures reveal the photo sharing service has lost almost 50 per cent of its daily users in less than a month .

"A British backpacker was fatally poisoned after drinking gin which had been mixed with methanol. Beautician Cheznye Emmons, 23, from Great Wakering, Essex, died after buying the alcohol while travelling in Indonesia with her boyfriend Joe Cook in April last year. Her father says his daughter had not realised the danger she was in because the symptoms of methanol poisoning are similar to a hangover - so victims often attempt to just sleep it off. Today an inquest in Chelmsford heard she had the drink, bought from a shop and with a seemingly legitimate label, with friends in Bukit Lawang, northern Sumatra. Cheznye Emmons, who died after drinking gin while travelling in Indonesia. The alcohol had been mixed with methanol and the beautician died in hospital five days later . Cheznye Emmons, 23, was travelling across Indonesia with her boyfriend, Joe Cook (right) when the pair became ill after drinking gin which had methanol in it . She was rushed to hospital after experiencing sudden blindness and convulsions and died five days later. High taxes on recognised brands of . wine, beer and spirits in Indonesia have prompted shop owners to mix the . drinks with a locally brewed substance called arak. Some, like in Cheznye's tragic case, are using methanol, which is colourless, to try and keep costs down. Father Brenton Emmons said: 'The . problem is the symptoms of methanol poisoning are a lot like a hangover . and people think they can just sleep it off,' he added . 'That’s what Cheznye tried to do and she died as a result.' Now her parents have spoken of their determination to prevent further deaths and prevent other families experiencing such heartbreak. Mother Pamela Emmons described her daughter as 'lively and outgoing'. The 23-year-old beautician was drinking with friends in Bukit Lawang, northern Sumatra, when she was poisoned. File picture . She added: 'She was focused on what she wanted to do with her life. She had lots of friends and had raised money for charity. 'It was like having a chunk of your heart ripped out but we know that she’d be proud of what we’re doing to try to save lives.' Mr Emmons said: 'In a lot of these countries they mix methanol with spirits and wine without a thought for the dangers. Cheznye was taken to hospital after suffering loss of sight and seizures. She was kept there for five days until her parents, Brenton and Pamela Emmons, were told there was no more doctors could do for her . Beautician Cheznye and her boyfriend, Joe Cook, both drank from the bottle which they had purchased in a local store. Mr Cook survived the alcohol poisoning in April . 'It’s very hard to tell the difference - sometimes there are bits floating in it, sometimes it might smell funny. 'This is being sold in shops, restaurants and bars - places where you might think it is safe. But the message is really ""stick to beer"" because otherwise you don’t know what risk you are taking.' Cheznye's parents have spoken of their determination to prevent further deaths and prevent other families experiencing such heartbreak . The family launched their Save a Life Campaign soon after the death and soon hope to distribute 20,000 posters highlighting the dangers to doctors’ surgeries. Because of how such deaths are recorded abroad, the family say it is impossible to know how many others have died in the same way. Mr Emmons said that since launching the campaign they have become aware of hundreds of other cases of people falling ill, with some dying. Ms Emmons was on a six-month trip travelling around Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. She had been staying in the local Rain Forrest Lodge when she fell ill, the inquest heard. Others in her group also reported feeling ill. Coroner Eleanor McGann concluded Ms Emmons died as a result of misadventure. She said: 'It is clear that she went off travelling expecting to enjoy life and to learn. Sadly this ended in her tragic death.' Methanol, which is also called methyl . alcohol, is used in numerous industrial applications, including the . production of formaldehyde, acetic acid and as a fuel component. In 2009 two Britons were among 25 people to die in Indonesia after drinking palm wine spiked with methanol. Alan Cole, 59, and Rose Johnson, 48, died in separate incidents after consuming traditional arak. Rachel Craig, 22, from Ireland and her boyfriend Rene Puper, 23, who was Dutch, were also among the dead. In June last year Swede Johan Lundin, 28, was poisoned by a mojito laced with methanol. His fiancee, Michaela Pechac, watched in horror as he died. In December an Australian schoolgirl was blinded after drinking a tainted cocktail while on a trip to Bali. An 18-year-old boy was also temporarily blinded during a trip to Bali in November. In February 19 year-old Liam Davies from Perth died after a vodka mixer was laced with methanol in Lombok.","Cheznye Emmons, 23, died on trip to Indonesia with boyfriend Joe Cook .

"Ever been told by a new neighbour ‘You must come for dinner’ then spent weeks waiting for a follow-up invitation that never arrives? Or been thrilled when the boss said he’d bear your ‘very interesting’ idea in mind and been surprised when it was never mentioned again. Then you’ve been victim of the uniquely British trait of being too prim and polite to say what we really mean. And if it can be baffling for us, imagine what it must be like for foreigners who take our every word at face value. Now there’s help in the form of a translation table which has become a huge hit on the internet. It reveals that when a British person begins a sentence ‘With the greatest respect...’, they’re really saying ‘I think you are an idiot.’ ‘I hear what you say’ means ‘I disagree and do not want to discuss it further’ while ‘That is a very brave proposal’ translates as ‘You are insane’. The table, which has been posted on numerous internet blogs, has received thousands of comments acknowledging that it’s spot on – from foreigners and Britons alike. New York-based Joanne Goddard who writes a blog called A Cup of Jo, says her English father often left her baffled. ‘When we were in high school, my sister asked him if she could drive to Detroit with her boyfriend to see a band. He said, “I’d rather you not.” She went anyway. When he got mad later, she was confused: “But you never said I couldn’t go”.’ The author of the table is a mystery, although some say it was drawn up a few years ago by a Dutch firm as a light-hearted help for executives working in the UK. It has since been added to. Lost in the post? The table demonstrates that it is common for a British person to say 'You must come for dinner' out of politeness but not make a real offer . One of the first people to post it was Duncan Green, a strategic adviser for Oxfam, who described it as ‘a handy guide for our fellow Europeans and others trying to fathom weaselly Brit-speak’. Mr Green said: ‘Sadly, I didn’t write it. It’s just one of those great things that is being passed around on the internet.’ Internet posters have been busy coming up with their own translations. Pam Burton wrote that ‘Leave it with me’ means ‘Hell will freeze over before you see a solution to this problem’. Another said ‘When you get a minute’ means ‘Do this immediately’ while a third says ‘Let’s keep in touch’ tends to mean ‘I never want to see or hear from you again’. And Peter Atkin wrote: ‘I came across this article while trying to find a way of explaining to a French company why their letter of recommendation, which seemed excellent on the face of it, would basically have damned me to the deepest pit of hell to any English company.’","Spoof translation table deciphering the truth behind British niceties is an internet hit .

Alexander said: ‘I had planned to propose to Marieke this summer, but this was a chance of a lifetime. I always had told Marieke that my proposal would be spectacular, well I think I succeeded. ‘It was the biggest moment of my life so it wasn't the right time to be nervous. It just had to be perfect.’ Marieke, who was told she had won a trip to Rhodes, which was being filmed by Thomas Cook, with her sister, said: ‘I honestly thought he would pop the question in a soccer stadium.

"Alex Song has paid a glowing tribute to Thierry Henry, hailing his former Arsenal team-mate as 'The King' after the France legend announced his retirement from football. World Cup winner Henry was a member of Arsenal's 'Invincible' Premier League-winning side in 2004 and won the Champions League with Barcelona as part of their treble-winning team in 2009 during his illustrious playing days.

"There have been times when Ryan Mason has made an instant impression. Micky Hazard knew it when he first saw him play aged seven. ‘It was the football brain,’ said Hazard, the former Tottenham midfielder who whisked Mason straight off to White Hart Lane. Mauricio Pochettino was quickly on to it, too. But there have been times when Mason must have felt invisible, as injuries and ill-conceived loan spells delayed his breakthrough. He came close to turning his back on the club he loves, but then Pochettino arrived and, after 16 years at Spurs, he is finally an overnight sensation. Mason (left) tussles with Marouane Chamakh during Tottenham's clash with Crystal Palace in December . Mason (left) and Ben Davies give out Christmas presents at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow . Mason celebrates his goal against Nottingham Forest in the Capital One Cup in September . Tottenham (2008 - ): 17 games, 1 goal . Yeovil (loan, 2009-10): 29 games, 6 goals . Doncaster (loan, 2010-11): 20 games, 1 goal . Millwall (loan, 2011-12): 6 games, 0 goals . Lorient (loan, 2013): 0 games . Swindon (loan, 2013-14): 22 games, 5 goals . Total: 91 games, 13 goals . ‘It’s something I’ve been waiting for,’ said Mason. ‘If this manager had been in charge two or three years ago, I would probably have 50 or 60 Premier League games under my belt by now. I’m in the team now and I can’t complain. It’s a great feeling. I’ve always believed I could play for this club.’ There were times when he had to fight the urge to leave. It was tempting when Eddie Howe wanted him at Burnley and Sean O’Driscoll tried to lure him to Doncaster, but he believed in his own ability. ‘It’s difficult to take when you don’t get the chance,’ said Mason. He speaks quietly but clearly and his words have meaning. He is not afraid of expressing his opinion. ‘There were times when I just wanted to leave and have a fresh start. I wasn’t getting the opportunities I thought I deserved. ‘I thought maybe going to a new club would change all that and that if I moved permanently instead of going on loan, I’d get treated differently. There were a few clubs in the Championship and I spoke to some managers, but I wanted to play for Tottenham. There was always that doubt that if I left I’d end up regretting it, and I would have definitely regretted it.’ During a frustrating spell at Spurs, Mason was tempted to take up an offer from Eddie Howe at Burnley . His story is a triumph for patience and faith, which are the attributes prompting some to tip him as a future Spurs captain. ‘He’s shown character and resilience,’ said Hazard. ‘There are not many opportunities in modern football — not like in my day — but I’m surprised he’s taken so long and it’s not easy to be patient. He clearly had the ability. From the age of six or seven, he stood out. He always knew what to do and where to do it. He had a natural understanding, and football intelligence separates the good from the great. ‘If you have a good football brain you can reach the very highest level, because the brain tells the feet what to do. He has good feet, good skill, he’s a good passer. You can still see he rarely gets caught.’ Mason had just turned seven when he attended one of Hazard’s soccer schools in Hertfordshire and, before he knew it, he was training at Tottenham, pocketing free tickets and marvelling at Teddy Sheringham from the stands. Mason's career at Tottenham has transformed since the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino (right) at the club . He was a No 10 like Sheringham until he went on loan to Yeovil where manager Terry Skiverton moved him deeper into the role he now plays. ‘I was a luxury player,’ said Mason. ‘Having been pampered at Tottenham for so long, I went into League One and had to graft and learn the ugly side of the game. I grew as a player.’ He was just 17 when Harry Redknapp gave him his Tottenham debut as a late substitute in a UEFA Cup tie, at the start of a season when he would score 58 goals for the youth team. But it was nearly six years before Mason started his first Premier League game, a north London derby at Arsenal. Between the dates there were loans at Yeovil, Millwall, Doncaster and Swindon and a disastrous five months at French club Lorient. He did not make a single appearance. ‘That was a bad experience,’ says Mason. ‘I was pretty close to the Tottenham first team and I’d been on the bench quite a bit, made my first start in the League Cup and then got a knee injury. ‘It was nothing major but I was out for a couple weeks and I fell down the pecking order. It probably wasn’t a good idea to pick Lorient but I thought playing in the top league in France would be better than playing in the Championship again. It just didn’t work out. I couldn’t wait to get home. I was there on my own from January until the end of the season. Mason has been at Tottenham since he was age seven and marveled at Teddy Sheringham from the stands . ‘I picked up a bit of French — that was the best part about it. I spent that season hardly kicking a ball.’ Others might have stormed home, but Mason was determined to see it out. A loan to Swindon eased the pain, but niggling injuries went on and his efforts to beef up didn’t help. ‘Between 18 and 21, a lot of people said I needed to put on weight,’ he said. ‘In England there’s a philosophy that it’s better to be bigger and stronger. I was in the gym doing bench-presses which had no relevance and it wasn’t helping me on the pitch. It was extra weight I didn’t need and I couldn’t carry. A lot of injuries came through that. Now I’m in a better place. I’m just under 6ft, I’m wiry and probably the lightest I’ve been, but the strongest.’ Pochettino’s arrival last summer from Southampton changed everything. Mason, now a box-to-box midfielder, has started the past 11 league games, keeping out expensive signings such as Paulinho and Mousa Dembele. Mason's good from has kept the likes of Paulinho (left) and Mousa Dembele out of the first team . It has been a spluttering Spurs season but there are signs of progress, climbing the Premier League and in a Capital One Cup quarter-final against Newcastle for which Pochettino, mindful of the heavy holiday fixture list ahead, may well shuffle his pack . Mason said: ‘This club needs to win trophies. It’s important to aim for the Champions League as well. Though we’ve had a pretty poor start we’re close to fourth and if we can get consistency it can happen.’ Mature and confident, he has embraced responsibilities on and off the pitch. Last week, he joined team-mates to deliver Christmas gifts to children in Harlow’s Princess Alexandra Hospital. ‘Two or three weeks into pre- season, I realised it might be different,’ said Mason. ‘Maybe it came down to a bit of trust. The gaffer recognised I had a good pre-season and was training well. He said I’d play for him in the Premier League this season. To hear that was great. Mason was just 17 when Harry Redknapp  (above) gave him his Spurs debut as a substitute in a UEFA Cup tie . ‘He’s a strong believer in giving 100 per cent in training. If you’re training well, you’ll play and I was one of the better players in training. 'He’s showed a lot of faith in me. I’m 23 and I feel like I deserve to be playing. It’s not like I’m a kid being thrown in. At the same time, not many managers would put an inexperienced player into the Premier League. ‘It’s such a big league, not many young, English, homegrown players get a fair crack of the whip, but this gaffer brought young players through at Southampton. Hopefully I can continue to pay him back. I don’t want to be one of these players who have a good little spell.’ Mason (left) has a transformed into a box-to-box midfielder and has started the past 11 league games .

"It was once a distant dream found only in sci-fi books. But 50 years on, satellite television pictures are now beamed into millions of homes around the world. Today marks the half-century anniversary of the first public satellite television broadcast across the Atlantic from the United States to Britain and mainland Europe. The transmissions using a space satellite launched into orbit revolutionised popular entertainment and sparked an explosion in technological development. Historic: Television monitors in New York on July 12 1962 show the first images broadcast by satellite from the UK to to the U.S. 'It wasn't actually the first . satellite broadcast but because it was seen by so many people when it . was on, it had a tremendous impact on people's perception of distance . and extension of their consciousness,' said Iain Logie Baird, grandson of television . pioneer John Logie Baird and curator of broadcast culture at the . National Media Museum in Bradford. 'Their perception of the world had changed. Suddenly you could see across the ocean as easily as you could make a phone call.' Three years after the first satellite broadcast, a child watched the first televised pictures of the moon in 1965 thanks to the technology introduced a few years earlier . The first transatlantic face-to-face television broadcast from Europe to the U.S. takes place on October 15, 1963. They are discussing 'The Christian Revolution' The . first ever satellite broadcast came against the backdrop of the Cold . War, a year after Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first man . in space. In the same year, The Beatles released their first hit . single, Love Me Do, Steptoe and Son was beginning on BBC, and Britain's . first legal casino had opened in Brighton. Domestic . television - broadcasts on electromechanical signals - had been airing . since 1920s and tens of thousands of families had TV sets. The signals were sent by ground broadcasts from TV towers but satellite was delivered from space.

Footballers in Greece watch this year's Euro 2012 football tournament on a TV set receiving the same footage beamed around the world . But the satellite images were a changing point for British culture, according to Mr Baird. A . Telstar staellite was launched by Nasa into space from Maine in New . York and a British receiver was built on Goonhilly Downs in Cornwall. Mr . Baird said that before Telstar, TV stations had to record on to tapes, . which would then be flown to the destination country, meaning there . could be a delay of hours if not days before they were broadcast. With live footage beamed from all corners . of the globe today, it is hard to grasp how much faster . satellite transmissions made delivering news and other images, he added. The Telstar satellite, which belonged to . telecommunications giant AT&T, was launched by Nasa at 4.35am on . July 10 1962, and the first television picture relayed from earth to . space and back occurred later the same day, with a transmission of the . American flag waving in front of the Earth Station in Andover, Maine. Technology breakthrough: Engineers work on the Telstar satellite, which Nasa launched into Orbit in 1962 in order to make the first ever satellite TV broadcast . Control staff at Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall, which used Antenna One, right, to receive the first live television signals from the U.S. through the Telstar satellite . Advance: The completed Antenna One at Goonhilly Earth Station. It is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first satellite TV broadcast . The first public images beamed from . New York to the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station in Cornwall on July 23 . should have been of President John F Kennedy, but because of a delay in . the United States viewers were first treated to footage of a baseball . game which was being shown on US television. Despite . the seeming simplicity of what could be seen, the broadcast was the . largest outside broadcast ever surpassing the BBC operation covering the . coronation of the Queen in 1953,  Mr Baird said. A television set from the 1940s that would have been able to pick up the first satellite broadcast . An AT&T spokesman said the idea of an active satellite, which does not simply reflect signals but amplifies and retransmits them, was conceived by science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke in 1945. Ten years later John Pierce, of Bell Telephone Laboratories, published a scientific paper outlining the possibilities for satellite communications. But it was the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 that really lit a fire under the plans. In January 1960, AT&T and Nasa agreed to a joint project. AT&T would design and construct an experimental satellite and pay Nasa to launch it in what would be the first privately sponsored space launch. 'The 34.5in (1.1m), 170lb (77kg) satellite fit Nasa's Delta rocket and once in orbit would receive microwave signals from a ground station, amplify them and rebroadcast them,"" the spokesman said. 'The team calculated an orbital path the rocket could reach, and located an ideal site for the US ground station near Andover. 'Here they built a massive 160-foot-diameter horn antenna, protected from the elements by the largest air-supported structure ever built. 'On that morning in July 1962, the team held its collective breath as countdown led to a perfect blast-off. Telstar was in space.' That evening vice president Lyndon Johnson, later president of the United States, received the first satellite telephone call and within 30 minutes, Telstar produced several other firsts: successfully transmitting faxes, high-speed data and both live and taped television. The satellite was used for several television demonstrations before going out of service on February 21 the following year.","Signals were broadcast from space instead of BBC's existing ground transmissions .

"Ronnie Moore has been confirmed as manager of the Football League’s bottom club Hartlepool United, eight months after he was sacked by Tranmere Rovers for a breach of betting rules. Sportsmail revealed last week that the 61-year-old was set for a return to the dugout at Victoria Park. And, on the same day the club confirmed that TMH 2014 had completed their takeover from Norwegian owners IOR, they unveiled Moore as the new boss. Ronnie Moore has returned to management with League Two's bottom club Hartlepool United . Moore broke the rules after placing 95 bets via a family member’s account, including a £1 stake on Tranmere . New chairman Peter Harris said: 'We believe that having Ronnie in charge will give the club the best possible chance of remaining in the Football League and we will provide him with all the support he needs to help him achieve that. ‘He is a very experienced manager which is something we felt was needed but he’s also a tough character who is very much prepared for the battle ahead.’ Moore was fired by Tranmere in April after he admitted an FA charge relating to betting on competitions and matches in which his club was involved. He broke the rules after placing bets via a family member’s account, including a £1 stake on Tranmere to win in a double with Manchester United, which returned £3.93. The final straw for Hartlepool's hierarchy came when non-League Blyth Spartans beat them in the FA Cup . Following his dismissal, Moore said: ‘The only thing I’m guilty of really is I’m embarrassed because as a manager of Tranmere Rovers I should have known (the rules) – so I hold my hands up, it was my fault.’ Speaking at the time, his solicitor, Steve Smith, added: ‘The prosecution accepted there were no integrity issues against him.’ Moore was fined £2,000 and given a one-month suspension, suspended for two years. His new club, meanwhile, are six points from safety at the bottom of League Two and have not won in the league for two months. He replaces Paul Murray – sacked after just seven games – and will be assisted by current caretaker Sam Collins.

"Less than two years ago Wasps’ players reached the end of each month not knowing if they would even get paid. Losing money at a rate of close to £4million a season and unable to identify a suitable site around the M25 to build a new stadium, one of the most successful clubs in the history of English rugby was sinking. In massive debt to the taxman and with no means of generating profit as tenants of Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park, Wasps’ decline appeared terminal. On Tuesday, following major investment from Irish businessman Derek Richardson and a new sponsorship deal with Land Rover, Wasps conducted a first training session at their new, 32,000 capacity Ricoh Arena home in Coventry. The sun shines on a new dawn for the Wasps as Dai Young's side train at their new Ricoh Arena, Coventry .

The former England playmaker and lynchpin for the former London side practises his kicking from the tee . There is talk of significant further investment, ‘world-class’ training facilities, record crowds and a major recruitment drive. Despite early resistance from a significant number of fans when the plan to relocate to the Midlands was first announced in October, it is hard to escape a sense that the good times are once again just around the corner for the two-time European champions. ‘It’s just a massive sigh of relief,’ said fit-again winger Christian Wade, who is expected to feature in the club’s first Aviva Premiership clash at the Ricoh on Sunday against London Irish, when a record home crowd of more than 27,000 is expected. Joe Simpson enjoys some space on the new temporary surface laid by Wasps ahead of their arrival .

Pretty much all the time we were always worrying about what was going to happen. Are we moving or are we going to have a club next year? Do I need to speak to my agent? Do I need to move clubs? ‘This facility is amazing. It’s probably the dream for any player in the world to have your own stadium and your own training ground in the same area.’ Sportsmail understands Wasps have already secured the services of Leinster fly-half Jimmy Gopperth, and chief executive Nick Eastwood confirmed that the club will be in a position to spend up to the £5.5million salary cap next season for the first time.

In October the club announced a contract extension with England lock Joe Launchbury — who will see a specialist tomorrow to discover if he needs surgery on a persistent neck injury which is threatening his Six Nations. Director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘Everyone realises now that we are in the market for top quality international players, whereas probably 18 months ago we weren’t. ‘Teams are built, you can’t just buy teams, but it certainly helps if you can buy a little bit of stardust to sprinkle on solid foundations.’ Revenue from ticket sales for Sunday’s opener against the Exiles has already passed £500,000 and with the possibility of a winner-takes-all final European Cup pool game in January, the business logic behind the move is evident.

Sportsmail understands Wasps have already secured the services of Leinster fly-half Jimmy Gopperth . ‘This will be the most successful game we have ever staged,’ said Eastwood, who is predicting a massive increase in the club’s annual turnover from £7m to more than £20m. ‘The revenue will be three times the highest grossing game we had at Adams Park. ‘In 18 months we have gone from being bust, tenants in a fourth division football ground to owning probably the best arena in club rugby in Europe and financial security. It is pretty remarkable.’ n London Irish are today expected to announce that director of rugby Brian Smith will leave at the end of the season.

"'Forced out': Stephen Clements, 51, is suing Lloyds Banking Group for £1 million in lost earnings . A senior Lloyds executive was forced out of his job because he blew the whistle on 'shocking' failures in the bank’s IT systems that would have cost £200 million to fix, a tribunal has heard. Stephen Clements, 51, the former head of the business continuity at Lloyds Banking Group, alleges there was a . deliberate cover-up to stop the flaws being dealt with due to the cost of repairing the problem and the potential damage to the bank's reputation. Mr Clements claims he discovered 'startling' failures in the bank’s IT Disaster Recovery back-up system that left the bank vulnerable to failures that could bring it down. The problems were so severe they threatened to 'destabilise the British economy', it was said today. But he said that when he tried to flag up the worrying deficiencies to his boss last March he was told to 'burn the paper' it was written on and the issue was effectively buried. Mr Clements says he was forced from his job as the senior executive in charge of protecting Lloyds’ systems from crises just four months after raising his concerns. He had already been warned he could be moved to another post, and he alleges the unwanted move was because of his age and the boss’s desire to replace him with a woman. The bank denies his allegations. The father-of-three from Bristol, who earned £130,000 a year in pay and benefits, is suing the bank for £1 million in lost earnings. He alleged whistleblowing and sex and age discrimination. In documents submitted to the Central London Employment Tribunal, the 51-year-old said he was 'startled' to discover that only a third of the bank’s systems had undergone crucial testing, leaving 'very serious gaps in our ability to recover critical IT systems'. Mr Clements said the failure to undertake the risk assessments could have a potentially catastrophic impact on the country’s economy. He said the impact would dwarf a similar glitch at the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) last June that left millions of customers unable to access their accounts. He said: 'The LBG issues are much bigger and could potentially send the bank out of business, thereby destabilising the British economy. I raised a really serious concern.' However, when he told his boss Jonathon Shawcross, director of group security and fraud, about his fears in an email in March 2012, he claimed the executive 'took great exception' and told him to 'burn the paper and never bring it out again’. 'Failings': Mr Clements claims to have discovered deficiencies in Lloyds Banking Group's IT back-up system . Mr Clements added: 'Effectively this issue was buried. Jonathon had responsibility for ensuring these [assessments] were carried out. The statistic that only 37 per cent of systems had a BIA (business impact assessment) completed is both startling and shocking. 'It was the responsibility of information risk to ensure that these essential risk assessments were being carried out and it had failed to do so.' Mr Clements claims he repeatedly wrote to his manager urging him to tell other senior executives of the urgent need to strengthen these security tests. But when he confided his fears in another senior employee at Lloyds, Mr Clements claims he was told that top executives at the state bailed out bank were engaged in a cover up because they feared the cost of rectifying the problem would cost a staggering £200million. In his statement he said Cheryl Newton, a peer of Mr Shawcross and equally responsible for IT Disaster Recovery at Lloyds, told him of the cover up. He said she 'told me that if she had escalated this issue up the line, she 'would lose [her] job’ because Mark Fisher (Director of Operations), Alan Peacock (IT Service Delivery Director) and Jonathan wanted the problem 'covered up’, not only because of the potential cost to remedy the problems (over £200m) but also because of the extensive damage to the public’s confidence in the bank.' Potential: Mr Clements said the impact would dwarf a similar glitch at the Royal Bank of Scotland last June . A Lloyds employee for more than 20 years, Mr Clements was a successful executive with a string of achievements to his name. But he claims his job turned sour in 2011 and believes his boss was scheming to out him from his job so he could give it to a woman, Nicola Nicols, who Mr Shawcross had worked with at RBS. Mr Clements alleges he was ordered by Mr Shawcross to place Miss Nicols as his possible successor on an internal document - despite major concerns about her lack of experience. Former employee: The former head of the business continuity earned £130,000 a year . In his statement he said: 'In April 2011 Jonathon instructed me to include Nicola’s name against my name/role in the 0-2 years column. 'I replied that I did not think she was ready to take over in my role within that time. Jonathan leant across the table and said aggressively 'I will be the judge of that’. That was the end of the conversation and her name was duly included.' Nine months later in his yearly assessment meeting on January 5 2012, Mr Clements claims his boss subjected him to a litany of ageist comments and told him: 'It is difficult for you because you are not 25 anymore' and 'you have been here too long'. He claims Mr Shawcross then told him he wanted to remove him from his post within the next two months and get in a 'fresh pair of eyes' to take up his job. Following two failed grievance hearings against his boss, Mr Clements resigned in July last year.Lloyds and Mr Shawcross strongly deny any wrongdoing and insist that Mr Clements was treated properly. In a statement Mr Shawcross said: 'I categorically deny any suggestion that I have treated Steve detrimentally on the basis of his gender or his age and there is no truth in Steve’s suggestion that I ought to replace him with Nocola Nicol. 'I further strongly refute any suggestion that Steve has been treated to his detriment by me or Lloyds in any way as a result of either raising a grievance, filing litigation or raising concerns surrounding the ITDR report. 'I am very regretful that the situation has come to this.' A Lloyds banking group spokesman said: 'We take the continuous provision of service to our customers very seriously. 'As this is the subject of an ongoing employment tribunal it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.' The tribunal continues.","Stephen Clements told a tribunal he had raised the issue with his boss .

When Ms Cotterill fell ill, the cancer, which grew primarily in her placenta, spread quickly to her lungs. By the time she was diagnosed, doctors gave her 24 hours to live and her consultant said she was . the most dangerously ill patient he had seen in 20 years. Diagnosis is based on levels of a pregnancy hormone called HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin). Ms Cotterill's levels of the hormone were by far the highest that Barry Hancock, professor of clinical oncology, had ever seen.

Her train - which was around 28 times the length of Manchester United's Old Trafford pitch - was carried by an army of volunteers as Miss De Angelis was driven through the streets in a vintage car. Around 20,000 people attended her wedding to Ferdinand Pucci last year to see the outfit that took dozens of seamstresses months to make. Made from 1.86-mile (three kilometres) of tulle bordered by six miles of silk, the endless train is apparently tied for the title of world's longest with a design by Andree Salon for this year's Wedding Fair in Bucharest.

Mr Molaro said of his creation last year: 'I was really grateful to be asked to design this veil. I met tens of thousands of people on the way to the church who complimented my idea. 'I wanted this veil to symbolise peace and hope and I think we have achieved this. 'This has been one of the biggest moments in my career as a designer.'

"With dazzling flashes of green, blue and white, a mysterious object lit up the Utah sky early this morning. It silently soared over the state at around 4.40am, seemingly lingering for a few seconds. But while some excitedly rushed to report a UFO, one astronomer claims it was a burning meteor that was so far away it couldn't be heard. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mysterious: A star gazer noticed a mysterious white object (top right) looming into view at 4.40am in Utah . Dazzling: It silently flashed brighter than the moon, lighting up the sky for a number of seconds . A video captured the a burning white ball's passage through the sky. Seconds later, neighbours took to Twitter reporting flashes of blue and green. One wrote on UFO Stalker: 'At approximately 4:43 am I was in my back yard having a cigarette. 'The sky was crystal clear, and as usual I was looking up at the sky, looking at the Orion constellation. 'Then in front of me I saw a bright green, white, blue, light with a tail. 'Reminding me of a falling star, except much larger, and slower. Strange: The light slowly faded as the object drifted out of view slowly and steady as others saw it to be blue . 'Then I thought of the meteor over Russia. As I watched this object, I had time to think how big it appeared, and that it was traveling silently. 'It lasted several seconds, four to eight. As it moved across my field of vision the tail seemed to be sparking, or breaking off in pieces. 'It was close enough that I expected to hear a crash, as it seemed to be traveling in a downward direction. 'As it travelled (sic) behind structures and out of my sight, I thought I should go see if I could find it, thinking that it would have come down very close. 'I did not go though. I do not know what it was. I know it was not a simple falling star. It was way to big, and moving way to slow.' Speck: It then inexplicably lost all its light before gradually lighting up again, which many said is like a UFO . Contradicted: An astronomer claims this behavior is typical of a bolide meteor which is about to combust . According to Patrick Wiggins, the NASA/JPL solar system ambassador to Utah, the variety of flashing colours is typical of a bolide meteor, which combusts at the end of its flight. It is caused by the rock cooling down as it passes through the atmosphere. Once the bolide explodes, it will likely send pieces hurling down to earth - which could be very valuable. If nearby, the sheer pace of the bolide could be so loud it could crack windows . But Wiggins explained, despite shining brighter than the moon, it was lightyears away because it was silent. .","Utah residents reported flashing white, blue, green lights at 4.40am .

"Blackpool wants to use new anti-lout powers to ban 'inappropriate dress' on stag and hen weekends.

For years stag and hen nights have been held in Blackpool but now the local council could use sweeping new powers to outlaw any activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life (File photo) The Daily Mail reported last month how Town Halls were being given sweeping new powers to outlaw any activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life. Ministers insist the so-called public spaces protection orders (PSPO) are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and aggressive begging. But the rules have been so widely drawn that councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of 'nuisance parking', children playing ball games and parents parking outside schools. Council officers can put up signs banning an activity in a specified area, either round the clock or during specific hours. Anybody flouting the order will be liable for an on-the-spot fine, normally ranging from £70 to £100, issued by a police officer, PCSO, council worker or private security guard employed by the local Town Hall. Blackpool has long been regarded as fun town and in what is often thought of as its heyday (1900–1950), it thrived as the factory workers of northern England took their annual holidays there (File photo) Refusing to pay will be a criminal offence that can land the person responsible in court.

Josie Appleton, of the Manifesto Club, said: 'This move to regulate public dress - and to make it a criminal offence to dress inappropriately - represents a worrying move of the state into questions of fashion and mores. 'There are laws against public disorder - a measure such as this will make the mere showing of cleavage into a criminal offence.

Amid an outcry from tourism firms, Mr Cain later clarified that he only wanted to deter the more unruly groups who behave in a lewd and drunken way, putting off other visitors. The town also rebuffed a bid by TV reality show Geordie Shore to come to Blackpool and restrictions have been placed on its lap-dancing clubs, insisting dancers do not remove all their clothing. In a statement, Mrs Campbell said yesterday: 'We have a strong record of tackling anti-social behaviour, however, we know that doing so is a never ending process and we cannot rest on our laurels. Blackpool's image to the rest of the UK is typified by the hat this holidaymaker is wearing (File photo) 'We won't hesitate to use and test these new powers to send a message loud and clear; anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated in Blackpool.'

"It’s the kind of gadget to have Patsy and Edina purring with approval… Champagne at the press of a button. But this vending machine is not a prop from Absolutely Fabulous. It has been installed in the luxury department store Selfridges. Well-heeled customers can enjoy chilled 200ml bottles of Moët & Chandon at £18 a pop. The vending machine holds 350 bottles, each of which is coated in mini Swarovski crystals  – without any of the more usual fizzy drinks in sight. Scroll down for video . The Moet and Chandon dispenser is the first champagne vending machine in the world . It holds 350 200ml bottles of the fizzy tipple - and each one is coated in mini Swarovski crystals. The golden Moet and Chandon vending machine has taken pride of place at famous London department store Selfridge’s. The vending machine is so flash that it doesn’t accept coins. Instead shoppers have to pre-pay for the champagne at a special counter in the heart of the Oxford Street store’s ‘Christmas Emporium’. And, unlike normal vending machines where items are dropped from a height, clattering down into a tray below, the Moet dispenser delivers its spoils with a golden robotic arm. The 200ml bottles are coated in mini Swarovski crystals and cost £18 each . But buyers will have to bring their own glasses if they want to enjoy their posh purchase on the go. Dawn Davies, wine and spirits buyer at Selfridges, said: 'Working with Moet & Chandon to unveil the world’s first champagne vending machine has been an exciting collaboration for Selfridges. 'The timing couldn’t be more perfect - they make a lovely little stocking filler. 'The installation forms part of our bespoke, personlised gifting taking place throughout the store. 'This year, Selfridges have taken Christmas to a whole new level, transforming the entire fourth floor into a one-stop destination for gifting. 'The inclusion of the world’s first Moet vending machine makes a decadent addition to our Christmas Emporium.' The Moet and Chandon dispenser is the first champagne vending machine in the world, and the latest in a line of luxury vending machines to be unveiled. Westfield Shopping Centre in London has a machine that dispenses gold bars while its LA malls are stocked with dispensers selling caviar, truffles and snails. A vending machine at the Mondrian South Beach hotel in Miami sells luxury items such as Bentley cars, Jean Paul Gaultier dresses and 24 carat gold handcuffs.

The Hollywood pair’s first vintage, made at their 1,000-acre estate in the South of France, came 84th in Wine Spectator magazine’s Top 100. It is the first rosé to ever make the list. The £18 bottle was described as ‘refined and elegant’ and given an ‘outstanding’ 90 out of 100. French experts helped produce the wine, but Jolie, 38, and 49-year-old Pitt - nicknamed Brangelina - had a role in the blending process at their £20million Château Miraval estate in Provence. Bottles of the 2012 Jolie-Pitt & Perrin Côtes de Provence Rosé Miraval sold out within hours when it was released in March.","Machine holds 350 200ml bottles of Moet & Chandon .

Anchor Max Bretos has been taken off-air for 30 days for using the phrase 'Chink in the armor' when talking about the basketball player who is of Asian descent. ESPN writer Antony Federico was fired after using the same phrase in a story headline on their mobile website after the Knicks lost to New Orleans on Friday. New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin filed for trademark protection over the word 'Linsanity' this week . On Twitter Bretos said: 'My wife is Asian, would never intentionally say anything to disrespect her and that community. 'Wanted 2 apologize 2 all those I have upset. Not done with any racial reference. Despite intention, phrase was inappropriate in this context.' Bretos said he had learned from the gaffe and that he would make 'every effort' to avoid something like this happening again. Federico also apologised for his blunder - and said he was not trying to be offensive. 'This had nothing to do with me being cute or punny,' he told the New York Daily News. 'I'm so sorry that I offended people. I'm so sorry if I offended Jeremy.' The headline appeared on the ESPN mobile website between 2.30am and 3.05am on Saturday morning. He added that he had used the same headline on stories at least a hundred times before and did not think anything of it.

Have to learn to forgive, and I don't even think that was . intentional. Or hopefully not.' In a statement released yesterday, ESPN apologized . for the headline and also said they are aware of other ‘offensive and . inappropriate’ comments on ESPN outlets. ESPN says a similar reference was made on Friday on ESPN Radio New York, but the commentator was not one of their employees. Lin is the NBA's first American-born . player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent. He has captivated fans by . leading the Knicks to seven straight wins before Friday's loss against New Orleans. This is not the first time that his ethnicity has sparked some racial taboos.

While also knowing the lucrative business opportunity before him, Mr Chang admits . potential willingness to sell the ownership to Mr Lin or any other if gained. 'I'll think about it when that time comes,' he said. 'Right . now, I just want to have some fun with it.' The second man to file trademark rights is Andrew W Slayton . who filed on February 9. Mr Slayton said he once coached Mr Lin in high school but . now works as a physical education teacher at a Los Altos high school.

"Julie Spence, the former chief constable of Cambridgeshire, says the force spent ‘far more on the team doing the CRB checks  than we were actually putting into child protection' More police resources are devoted to vetting law-abiding volunteers and job applicants than pursuing and monitoring sex offenders, a former chief constable warns today. Last year, 843,000 volunteers were given criminal record checks, including parents who go into school to help children read or assist on trips. A study today for the Civitas think-tank finds that the Coalition has failed in its pledge to more than halve Disclosure and Barring Service checks, formerly known as Criminal Record Bureau checks, from 4million to 1.7million a year. Some 3.9million checks were carried out last year on volunteers and job applicants who could have unsupervised contact with children. Julie Spence, the former chief constable of Cambridgeshire, says the force spent ‘far more on the team doing the CRB checks – because they were funded by government – than we were actually putting into child protection’. She told researchers: ‘In most forces, more money goes into checks than investigation.’ Mrs Spence claimed armies of staff worked on vetting nationwide, but the monitoring of sex offenders was generally the responsibility of a ‘small team’ of officers who ‘don’t have an enormous budget’. Offenders deemed to present the highest risk could get visits weekly or a couple of times a month, she said, while the least risky would be seen perhaps once ‘every few months’. After coming to power in 2010, the Coalition pledged to slash the use of checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service. But anyone who could have unsupervised contact with children at least once a month must still be checked. Town halls made 661,092 checks last year on those such as parents running the school disco and volunteers who drive the elderly to the shops. The report’s author, Josie Appleton, said public bodies appeared to be going beyond what was required by the law, with local authorities carrying out checks on public sector jobs such as tree surgeons and a beauty therapy lecturer. There are 23 types of checks, depending on the type of position involved. The most basic service costs £26. An enhanced check for a teacher, nurse or care home worker costs £46. Overzealous: Local authorities carrying out checks on public sector jobs such as tree surgeons and a beauty therapy lecturer. File picture . The total cost has been £2billion in a decade, including £211.6million last year. Much of this goes to the consultancy firms making the checks. Among others, there are 730 people employed by the DBS, hundreds of police staff, workers from 3,688 bodies who submit checks, and 300 employees at Tata Consultancy Services. But Miss Appleton said that often the worst offenders would not be picked up anyway, adding: ‘It is notable that many of the shocking cases of child abuse in recent years – from Jimmy Savile to the Catholic Church – involved individuals without criminal records. The failure was a failure to report and to investigate allegations, rather than a lack of checking.’ The Home Office said: ‘Criminal records checks are essential. We changed the vetting and barring arrangements because the old system was disproportionate and excessive. Without these changes the number of checks would have increased significantly.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . Rapes recorded by the police have hit their highest level ever, with an average of 60 attacks every day. Shocking figures, disclosed yesterday, showed that rapes in England and Wales rose by almost 30 per cent to 22,116 in the year to June. Knifepoint rapes were up by 48 per cent to 294 attacks – almost six a week. According to the Office for National Statistics figures, 13,455 of the victims were women, the rest being men and children. Ministers said victims were ‘more willing’ to report sex crimes and police were more likely to take complaints seriously, partly due to greater scrutiny following the Jimmy Savile scandal. Police recording practices had also improved. ONS head of crime John Flatley said: ‘We have seen over the last few years a notable rise in victims coming forward to report historical offences. So victims are coming forward now to report recent occurrences rather than historical ones.’ The total number of crimes reported to forces in England and Wales was 3.7million, the same as the previous year. Violent crime surged by 11 per cent to 666,700 offences, but the ONS said this could be due to police recording complaints more accurately after accusations of ‘fiddling’ figures to meet targets. The picture was complicated by the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which indicated violent crime had fallen by 23 per cent. The survey, which is based on people’s experiences of crime, found a 16 per cent fall in overall crime to 7.1million incidents, the lowest since 1981, but it did not include 300,000 frauds. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘These figures show a shocking failure to help rape victims and bring dangerous criminals to justice.’","Last year 843,000 volunteers had criminal record checks - costing £211m .

"Imagine living in a sustainable city with legs that could move anywhere in search of better jobs and resources. Your postcode would constantly change as you’re taken around the world on board a gigantic caterpillar-like metropolis. It might seem like an absurd concept, but this is exactly what is being proposed by Madrid-based architectural student Manuel Dominguez. Architectural student Manuel Dominguez has proposed the development of a sustainable city with legs that could move anywhere in search of a better resources . In his vision, the nomadic city would use caterpillar tracks – similar to the ones used for tanks – to move to areas were work for residents is easily available. 'I wanted to built territorial management between matter and energy, that will bring several positive effects,' Mr Dominguez told MailOnline. 'These include re-equilibrating the population between rural and cities, environment renewal and offering new employment,' Named the ‘Very Large Structure’, the walking metropolis would have everything you’d expect from a city, including sports facilities, restaurants, universities, hospitals and libraries. The nomadic city would use caterpillar tracks - similar to the ones used for tanks - to move to areas were work for residents is easily available . Named the 'Very Large Structure', the walking metropolis would have everything you'd expect from a city, including sports facilities, restaurants and universities . This basic structure, built on caterpillar tracks, could provide one way of moving an entire city around the world in search of resources . This isn’t the first time someone . has come up with the idea of a moving city. British architect Ron . Herron’s ‘Walking City’ was first proposed in the 1960s. In the architecture journal Archigram, Mr Herron suggested building huge intelligent robotic structures that could freely roam the world. He proposed that various walking cities could interconnect with each other to form larger 'walking metropolises' when needed, and then disperse. The ‘Very Large Structure’ develops Herron’s vision by proposing clean energy generation on board using wind turbines, solar panels and hydrogen energy plants. Mr Dominguez said that the fact that the city moves around could be a way to encourage reforestation rather than destroying the surrounding environment.

The design may look like a bizarre concept, but with a number of the world's major cities in the midst of a slowdown, it may not be as futuristic as you might think . It can be easy to dismiss the design as yet another student project. But according to Mr Dominguez, the Very Large Structure is theoretically possible to build. 'Even though I am very attracted to science fiction and utopical and distopical architecture, I was more interested in investigating real life technology,'  Mr Dominguez told MailOnline. 'These included open-air mining machinery, shipyard installations, logistic and management in super-ports and super vessels, space technology and  eco-villages.' The design may look like a bizarre concept, but with a number of the world’s major cities in the midst of a slowdown, it may not be as futuristic as you might think. 'I think it could exist some day maybe at other scale,' added Mr Dominguez. 'Maybe in the way it relates and deals with territory, maybe the way in which we built and think about architecture and urbanism, maybe in the way we manage energy and waste.'

"Digital cameras have revolutionised photography, making photography cheap, easier and readily available to all. However, one photographer has shunned modern equipment to use a 160-year-old method that requires a portable dark room and an enormous camera that   captures just one image every 15 minutes. The collodion process - otherwise known as the wet plate process - was wildly popular from the 1850s to the 1880s. Invented by Frederick Scott Archer,   it was known for giving fine detail but also for being highly impractical. Echoes of history: A street scene in modern Newcastle city centre near the Quayside area taken by Jonathan Keys using the collodion process - an archaic photographic method . Clash: The historic buildings of the north-east city jar with the modern cars because of the archaic photographic method . Jonathan Keys, 41, from Newcastle, has been practicing the process for three years and says the results are highly satisfying.  'It's definitely far more rewarding than digital photography because of the time and attention needed for each picture,' he said. Mr Keys will only take two to six photographs per day when using the wet plate process and reckons there are only around 50 people doing it in the UK. While this style of photography may be completely baffling to most who simply press a button on their phone for instant snaps, Mr Keys takes a lot of   joy from it. He said: 'The fun part of it for myself is the need to be near a darkroom to process each shot.  'It's similar to a polaroid, once it's been shot you can move onto the next shot without thinking about the time you have to spend in Photoshop.' 'In theory it's actually quicker because many working photographers will spend hours on Photoshop, however you do end up with less images.' Mr Keys will only take two to six photographs per day when using the wet plate process and reckons there are only around 50 people doing it in the UK. Pictured, a busy stree in Newcastle city centre . Clash of cultures: A Roman re-enactor in front of modern cars, captured using a 160-year-old photographic method. Right, cars sit incongruously in the street scene . The process starts in the darkroom by pouring collodion onto one side of glass and then dipping it into silver nitrate, which makes it sensitive to   light.  While still under dark room conditions, the plate is then loaded into a camera and taken to Jonathan's desired location. Jonathan will then take his lens cap off the camera to expose the plate to light and guess how long the cap needs to be off for to obtain correct   exposure. The plate is then taken back to a dark room and developed in a similar way to conventional film negatives.  Unlike negatives and digital photos, the finished plate can be sealed with varnish to stop the silver oxidising and achieves a permanent record, as   proven by stills taken 150 years ago. Mr Keys admits that he's often quizzed by curious members of the public about using such an unusual camera, including famous comedian Johnny Vegas. A portrait of a couple in Newcastle city centre. While this style of photography may be completely baffling to most who simply press a button on their phone for instant snaps, Mr Keys takes a lot of joy from it . The full-time photographer explains: 'I use a wooden 10x8 Circa camera from the 1880s so I get questions all the time, especially in Newcastle city   centre. 'I'm always with another person whilst shooting, that way one of us can concentrate on the process whilst the other answers the inquisitive public.' Johnny Vegas was dumbfounded when I took the camera to book launch. He couldn't stop laughing and was expecting some flash powder! 'It's also a great way for making contacts as I've got a few photography jobs from a result of hanging around Newcastle with a big wooden box.'

"Senior doctors have expressed outrage at an NHS Trust's plans to move a unit which treats vulnerable children to just metres away from a paedophile therapy centre. The Tavistock Children's Day Unit, currently located in Gloucester House in Hampstead, north London, treats children up to the age of 16 with mental health problems including specialist services for those who have suffered trauma or have special educational needs. But Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust is giving serious consideration to building a new unit for the children in the gardens of the nearby Portman Clinic, the Camden New Journal reports. Hospital bosses are considering relocating this children's unit in north London to within a few metres of a clinic which treats paedophiles . It is one of the only places in the country where paedophiles can receive treatment on the NHS. Patients, who refer themselves voluntarily, are given 'forensic psychotherapy' in a bid to restrict their urges. The possible relocation of the children's unit has been met with disbelief by some clinicians. One therapist, who asked not to be named, told the Camden New Journal: 'This is very disturbing indeed – it is tantamount to trying to treat alcoholics in a brewery.' The therapist claimed that the move is particularly dangerous because group therapy sessions for paedophiles are held in a room which looks out directly into the garden. The source claimed that paedophiles could potentially be asked to talk about their fantasies while children are running around just metres away. However this claim has been denied by the Trust which insists the new unit would be self-contained and there would be no direct access from the Portman Clinic. Donald Campbell, a former consultant psychotherapist and former chair of the Portman Clinic, was among those to express concern. The proposed new location is to the rear of the Portman Clinic which is part of this hospital in north London . He said moving the unit into the Portman Clinic gardens could 'unwittingly put children at risk'. The Trust's chief executive Dr Matthew Patrick said the plans to move the unit had not yet been finalised, but insisted the proposed new site would not put children at risk. A spokesman for the Trust said: 'We would, of course, do nothing that endangered or disturbed our patients and we take our responsibilities very seriously. 'Our record for safety and quality has been acknowledged over many years by a wide range of official inspectors as well as by the health and local authorities which commission our services, and by our patients themselves. 'All the patients that we see here are living and being treated within the community. We have robust safeguarding and reporting measures, and work closely with partner organisations, to ensure the safe management of all our patients in the community. The Portman Clinic has a long, established history of successful treatment with its patients that attend the clinic. 'We fully risk-assess every activity that takes place in the Trust and as part of our planning we have conducted a full risk assessment on the potential new build. 'We do not currently perceive this potential move to pose any significant risk to anyone that we see. 'We have safely managed children, adult and forensic services for many years and will continue to do so. Both the Day Unit, the Tavistock Centre and the Portman Clinic have their own rigorous internalsafeguarding policies and procedures and we would expect, as with any other matters, any concerns.'","Tavistock Children's Day Unit treats vulnerable children under 16 .

"Wolfsburg midfielder Kevin De Bruyne was fined £15,000 by the German Football Federation on Monday after calling a ballboy a 'm*****f*****' during his side's 1-1 Bundesliga draw with Eintracht Frankfurt last week. The unsavory incident occurred in the latter stages of the second half with the visitors trailing 1-0 and chasing the game in search of an equaliser.

De Bruyne, who joined the Bundesliga side for £18million from Chelsea last January said he intends to send a signed shirt to the ballboy in question by way of saying sorry, Bild adds. 'So much of what you hear from Bundesliga players is questionable,' said Eintracht's Under-16 coach Jürgen Hickert, who has organised ballboys for the senior team for a decade. 'In spite of their money and success they should be role models. [Wolfsburg sporting director] Klaus Allofs said he is a good boy normally. Then he should talk to him about certain practices.'

"Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has confirmed there is no clause making him play Tom Cleverley after the on-loan midfielder's substitution against Chelsea was greeted with ironic cheers by sections of supporters. Lambert believes Cleverley, on a season-long loan from Manchester United, is 'trying too hard' but has backed the player to win frustrated fans over.

After another disappointing performance, sections of the home crowd cheered when Cleverley was taken off . He closed his Twitter account after suffering abuse from United fans, while an online petition was set up last year calling for him to be banned from England's World Cup squad. Cleveley subsequently missed out on a place - yet the petition came in for criticism from Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson. Lambert said: 'Tom is one of these guys who never hides from the ball. I never criticise anybody for looking for the ball if they make a mistake. 'As long as you don’t hide - and Tom never hides. 'He gives it everything he has got, everything to try and do well. He wants to do well here and sometimes that is part and parcel of football. It is not nice to hear.

"A Shetland pony described by the Queen as her favourite retires today after nearly two decades of military service. Cruachan III, who stands at just 90cm tall, has led a colourful career as a military mascot after leading the Royal Regiment of Scotland at dozens of Highland games, fairs and military parades. The 23-year-old pony, who has an unusually content temperament for the species, is a personal favourite of the Queen, who always requested that he be present at Balmoral when she visited Scotland. Last meeting: The Queen's favourite Cruachan III and Corporal Joe Walker meet the monarch in 2012 . Captain Dougie McDougall said Cruachan III can now look forward to a well-earned rest and the regiment is looking forward to welcoming his replacement, Cruachan IV. He said: 'The Tattoo was his last official show so from now on he can just relax in his field. 'He comes from a long line of tradition as the first Cruachan was a mascot of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders from 1928 to 1942, then Cruachan II was the mascot from 1950 to 1985 and finally Cruachan III served as the Argyll’s mascot from 1995 to 2009. 'He was then adopted as the Royal Regiment of Scotland’s mascot after the Argylls joined with The Royal Scots Borderers, The Royal Highland Fusiliers, The Black Watch and The Highlanders to form the Royal Regiment. Last call of duty: Cruachan III with Major Corporal Joseph Walker last month at the Shetland's last Tattoo . L/Cpl Moonan, left, with Cruachan III in the early days of his career at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh in 1995, and right, Pony Major Corporal Joseph Walker celebrates the pony's retirement at his last Tattoo in August . 'He’s done a lot of parades in his time and he was a real favourite of the Queen. 'If she was ever on holiday and knew Cruachan was around she would make sure he was there on the day that she arrived. She loves him to bits. 'We’ve got Cruachan IV coming down soon to start heading the parades which we are looking forward to.' Cruachan III performed at this years 63rd Tattoo which sold out for the 14th consecutive year, generating £8.4m at the box office. Captain Dougie McDougall is happy to see the 23-year-old Shetland Pony retire from service after 19 years as the mascot of the Royal Regiment of Scotland . Retired: Cruachan III has now retired from ceremonial duties and spends his time munching grass in a field . Lifelong friends: Placid Cruachan III lives with his feistier companion, piebald Shetland pony Islay . The show had a Diamond Jubilee theme, with more than 1,000 pipers, drummers and other musicians performing on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle to celebrate 60 years of the Queen’s reign. In 2008, when the Argylls returned from a gruelling six-month deployment to Afghanistan, Cruachan III led the Homecoming Parades through Stirling, Dumbarton and Alloa and also the Freedom of Canterbury Parade through Canterbury in England. Corporal Grant Rumbles looks after Cruachan III and Islay in their field at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh. Number one: The first Shetland pony mascot, Cruachan I, served with the regiment from 1928 to 1942 . Well trained: Cruachan II welcomes the regiment home from Cyprus in Southampton in 1959 . He said: 'He is as placid as they come, one of the best natured animals I have ever looked after. 'Shetland ponies have a reputation for being moody and a bit feisty; his companion Islay gets the hump all the time. 'But Cruachan is great and now has plenty of time to relax in his field and take it easy. 'He was the centre of attention every night at the tattoo but he is getting on a bit now, it’s time to give the next pony a go and Cruachan can go at his own pace.'","Cruachan III has served as mascot for the Royal Regiment of Scotland for 19 years .

"Lionel Messi and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho would not have a problem working together, according to Manchester United star Angel di Maria. Messi has been continually linked with a move away from Barcelona after rumours of a rift with boss Luis Enrique, but despite hearsay of a possible move to Chelsea among others, Di Maria expects the 27-year-old to stay put in the Catalonian capital. However, the former Real Madrid winger, who worked under Mourinho at the Santiago Bernabeu, was confident that compatriot and fellow Argentina international Messi would fit in well if he were ever to switch the Nou Camp for Stamford Bridge. Angel di Maria (left) said Lionel Messi would fit in well if he ever worked with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . 'In principle, I don’t think Leo wants to leave Barcelona. It’s hard to walk away from a club that’s given you everything, where you effectively grew up. 'But  no I don’t think he’d have any problem working with Mourinho,' he said. After Manchester United's frustrated performance against West Ham on Sunday, boss Louis van Gaal was widely criticised for not utilising Di Maria to his full potential as a pacy wide man. But the 26-year-old admitted he is enjoying his time in England since he made his £60million move from Madrid to Old Trafford. Di Maria joined Louis van Gaal's Manchester United for £60m last summer and is enjoying life in England . 'The weather is the only thing [I don't like]… it doesn’t help a lot. But I’m very content here. 'The people have a lot of affection for me, which is the most important thing. It’s what I value most, and I have that here'. When quizzed about his progress in learning English, the Rosario-born winger spoke with slightly less optimism. 'It’s very bad. [I’ve learned] very little and only understand a small bit. That said, I’m trying to learn it bit by bit and I’m taking classes. Hopefully I’ll pick it up quickly,' he admitted. The former Real Madrid winger (second right) compared Barcelona's Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (front) Unperturbed by the prospect of sounding  like a broken record, the Argentine was asked if he minded having to make constant comparisons of Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the latter with whom he played alongside in the whites of Real. 'No, because I always say the same thing: that they're two completely different players,' he remarked. 'Leo features in every game, making short bursts and nonchalantly dribbling past one, two or three players with great ball control in tight spaces. Cristiano is more about power and long range shots. They're different. 'If I were FIFA, I'd have two Ballon d'Or prizes; one for that pair to fight over and another for everyone else.'","Di Maria said he could see Lionel Messi and Jose Mourinho getting on .

"Sheffield Wednesday supporter Mark Ablett has been banned from football matches for three years after he threw a tangerine at Fulham fans during his side's 4-0 defeat at Craven Cottage last year . A Sheffield Wednesday fan who threw a tangerine at Fulham supporters as his team crashed to a 4-0 defeat has been banned from attending football matches for three years. Mark Ablett, 29, hurled the citrus fruit into the home crowd during the fixture on December 20 last year and was removed from Craven Cottage by stewards. Ablett, who was spotted throwing the ‘missile’ by CCTV, said after he was pulled from the stands: ‘I may have been stupid and thrown a tangerine or whatever’. A judge handed the charity financial officer a three-year football banning order and £360 in fines and costs after he admitted throwing a missile under the Football Offences Act. Prosecutor Malachy Packenham said Ablett could not give a proper reason for throwing the fruit into Fulham's Riverside Stand. Mr Packenham told Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court: ‘The home team Fulham were playing Sheffield Wednesday at Craven Cottage when Ablett was seen to throw this item at the Fulham fans. ‘He was identified by stewards and ejected from the stadium for the offence, which was captured on CCTV.' The prosecutor added: ‘It probably does not matter but it’s very difficult to get tangerines at this time of year, so this was possibly an orange.' Jyothi Somavarapu, defending, called for Ablett to be given a conditional discharge instead of an ‘unreasonable’ football banning order. Cauley Woodrow scores from the spot to make it 4-0 to Fulham against Sheffield Wednesday in December . The incident at Fulham's Craven Cottage was picked up by CCTV and Ablett was ejected by stewards . Ablett earns £16,000-a-year working for a local government funded charitable organisation which trains school leavers in ‘employability skills’ and has no previous convictions, the court heard. Ms Somavarapu said: ‘My client’s explanation was it was silly behaviour and he threw a tangerine, which he said landed on the pitch. ‘His only explanation is that the game was not going that well and that’s the only reason he can think of. Ms Somavarapu added: ‘He says it was a silly thing to do and he would not do again - otherwise he is a sensible person and is remorseful for what he did. ‘He is somebody who actually gives a lot to the community in his organisation’s projects and all he needs is a warning to him not to get into trouble again.’ Lasse Vigen Christensen of Fulham signals to the fans at full time after their crushing victory . Shaun Hutchinson makes it 2-0 to Fulham as Keiren Westwood dives in vain . But Deputy District Judge Kate Tulk said she had no other option but to ban Ablett from matches nationwide and abroad for three years. Judge Tulk told Ablett: ‘You said this was a silly thing but I do not take that view - it had incredibly serious consequences. ‘If that fruit had landed amongst opposing fans it had potential for them to respond badly and react and a whole load of consequences could have occurred. ‘The throwing of a missile is a very serious offence.' Ablett, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, was also ordered to pay £360, made up of a £250 fine, £85 prosecution costs and a £25 victim surcharge.

Refusing to vacate his decrepit, 350-square-foot room until his demands were met, Sukenik, staged a two-year masterclass in Big Apple tenant's rights that ended with him landing the huge check and a $2 million replacement apartment for which he paid $1 a month in rent until the day he died. The revelations of Sukenik's intransigent and stubborn refusal to move in 2005 have been outlined for the first time by Michael Gross in his new book 'House of Outrageous Fortune' which chronicles the construction of 15 Central Park West. Billion dollar development: This 15 Central Park West - which began construction in 2005 after Dr. Herbert Sukenik was paid $17 million to leave the Mayflower hotel which stood in its place . Home to the stars: Celebrities such as Sting and Alex Rodriguez live in !5 Central Park West . Sukenik is painted to be academically brilliant, the nephew of the man who recognized the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Born in The Bronx in 1930, Sukenik graduated from Cornell University with a physics degree, then went on to get a master's in physics and then a Ph.D before qualifying as a doctor. He worked for General Electric's Research laboratory and was named chief of space medicine at Martin Company's Space Systems Division. He moved into the Mayflower Hotel in 1974 - by which time he had become angry with the world - despite having been bequeathed a fortune by his father - who he had a difficult relationship with.'Herbert Sukenik’s profile was a nightmare,' said Will Zeckendorf, one of the two Manhattan real estate developers who built 15 Central Park West. 'Hugely intelligent, a Ph.D., unmarried, embittered, a loner, disconnected from society, and too smart for his own good. He was not a poor man; he had independent means.' Indeed, after taking control of the Mayflower Hotel, the Zeckendorf brothers set about removing the last four men who remained in the rent-controlled apartments in the top floors - each of whom had been living up there for the best part of 40-years. One man was 98 and left with only one suitcase and a million-dollar check. Another was an aging show-business agent, also in his 90s, who took a million dollars and then left according to the New York Post. Brothers: Real estate developers William Lie Zeckendorf, left, and Arthur W. Zeckendorf pose for photographers during the topping off of one of their ambitious New York City projects . The third was registered as David Jordan, but the Zeckendorf brothers were shocked to discover that that his real name for Arthur MacArthur IV - the son of World War II General and 'American Caesar', Douglas MacArthur. Born in Manila in 1938m Arthur was a minor celebrity as a child - and graced the cover of Life magazine while his father was running the Pacific war for the United States. However, it is claimed that he wanted to escape the shadow of his father's fame, changed his name and dropped out of the public eye when his father died in 1964. The gifted musician was paid $650,000 to leave the Mayflower and moved to Greenwich Village - where he remains to this day. However, for Michael Grabow, the attorney charged with removing the tenants, no one was more stubborn than Sukenik. 'He knew the last man standing was very valuable,' said Grabow. When Grabow first met Sukenik, he was struck by the mess of his tiny room, which had a kitchenette, a bathroom and views of Central Park and the East and Hudson Rivers - but the windows were so filthy they could not be seen. It was 'a wreck, a mess,' Grabow says. 'Clothes everywhere. Papers, magazines, two computers. He had to clear chairs to sit on.' Describing Sukenik, then aged 73, as having 'an old man smell' of someone who 'didn't shower much', Grabow conceded that the old man was clearly brilliant. Sukenik connection: Herbert Sukenik's uncle was one of the first men to recognize the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls . However, he was bitter. Annoyed that he had wasted his life idling away in his rent-controlled apartment. Grabow discovered that Sukenik was disliked by the Mayflower staff, 'He was a bitcher, a complainer,' said a former Mayflower manager. However, Sukenik knew the value of everything attached to his tiny room as compared to the value the Zeckendorf brothers expected to attach to 15 Central Park West. He demanded a replacement apartment in Essex House on Central Park South that was 2,200 square-foot, had two bedrooms and was on the 16th floor. The deal was that the Zeckendorf brothers would buy the apartment, retain ownership, but that he could have it for life at a rent of $1 a month. Famous father: Touring the U.S. for his first significant look at the country, Arthur MacArthur (right), 16-year-old son of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, queries Cary Grant about movie making on the set off ""To Catch a Thief"" Washington, DC - General MacArthur with his wife Jean and son Arthur IV as they wave to cheering crowds that lined the motor route between the Capitol and the Washington Monument grounds . However, just as it seemed that Sukenik was ready to leave, he told Grabow that he had got himself a lawyer and that he now wanted money - and lots of it. The Zeckendorf's refused to budge and even began the demolition of the Mayflower hotel around the room of Sukenik. Undeterred, Sukenik told the real estate developers that he loved the noise and the commotion. The game of waiting paid-off and in 2005 he left to move into the apartment on Central Park South and was gifted $17 million dollars. The first wrecking ball hit the Mayflower two days after Michael Grabow delivered Sukenik’s check. He died aged 80 living inside his new luxurious $1 a month apartment and left his fortune to his brother.","In 2003, Herbert J. Sukenik played hard ball with developers the Zeckendorf brothers .

"Follow Sportsmail's coverage as Manchester United host Chelsea in the Barclays Under 21 Premier League. The Blues currently lead the way in the youth league, however Manchester United could take top spot with a victory by a two-goal margin at Leigh Sports Village. Andy Kellett, a surprise transfer deadline day loan signing from Bolton, is on the Manchester United bench. It's a strong line-up from the hosts which includes keeper Victor Valdes and Ashley Young. Host commentator . That's all from us tonight. Thanks for joining and be sure to return soon for more live coverage. In terms of the table- Manchester United join Chelsea level on points to lead the Under 21 Premier League on 21 points along with Southampton (who were beaten by Everton tonight). So three at the helm thanks to United's dogged display. That's it! Manchester United have defeated the Under 21 league leaders Chelsea thanks to an impressive second-half comeback. Brown has a chance, a very tough one, to volley Chelsea back level but he can't keep his effort down as the Blues pour forward to equalise. The magnificent Charly Musonda is taken off, with Olna Aina nearly providing an assist with his first touch- a sublime cross on the right, but it evades Solanke. Christensen comes off for Dion Conroy as the Blues search for an equaliser . Nick Powell finds himself through on goal 12 yards out but he scuffs his shot and misses the chance to secure the three points . Pereira steps up and whips in a teasing cross. United captain Tom Thorpe rises unmarked to head the hosts into the lead. James Weir has been a fine addition to the United midfield since coming on and he plays through Pereira who is hauled down on the run . We're set for a pulsating final 10 minutes as both sides seem determined to find a winner... Tammy Abrahams replaces Kasey Palmer, who has had a decent outing for the Blues, linking up well with Brown in the Chelsea attack. Pereira is at it again. The Brazilian curls in a superb long distance strike but Beeney manages to tip it around the post to keep the scores level. The equaliser has rejuvenated the hosts. Rafael wins a freekick for the hosts and Andreas Pereira takes the honour. His effort deflects cruelly off Jay Dasilva in the Chelsea wall and flies into the net to level the match, wrong footing Mitchell Beeney. Izzy Brown is in full flow now. The Blues forward jinks past three challenges before whipping in a fierce drive from the edge of the United box. Fortunately for the home side Valdes was ready to react and tip the shot around the post with a smart save. Ashley Fletcher makes way for Donald Love (what a name)! Nick Powell is handed a yellow card as Manchester United continue to struggle to dictate the game in the middle, relying upon last ditch tackles. Charly Musonda shows off some silky skills to back heel Kasey Palmer through on goal on the left hand side of the pitch but his effort is clawed away by Valdes . Ashley Young makes way for James Weir after an hour on the park. The England international managed to ride several rough tackles and improve his match fitness after five matches out with a hamstring injury. Was he taken off immediately after being culpable in the Chelsea opener? The Blues have the lead! 1-0 to Chelsea. Ashley Young leaves Tyler Blackett under unnecessary pressure with a poor back pass and the lively Izzy Brown steals the ball off Blackett to find Dominic Solanke at the back post and tap in from a few yards. Nick Powell is slashed down by Christensen on the edge of the Chelsea area but Ashley Young whips the resulting freekick well over the bar. Six of the starting XI at Manchester United have played under first team manager Louis van Gaal this season. You'd think that would be enough quality to see off Chelsea this evening but the Blues are controlling the opening exchanges this half. We're back under way. Chelsea have been beaten just twice this season. Let's see what United can do about that . Andy Kellett (centre, back row) is currently on the Manchester United bench. Remember the 21-year-old defender was plucked from the Bolton reserves on loan on transfer deadline day in a shock swoop by Louis van Gaal's side. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE . That's the half-time break at the Leigh Sports Village Stadium. It's been tense and well fought but very few clear chances to rave about . The referee is perhaps a bit trigger happy with the cards as Andreas Pereira enters the book. Charly Musonda uses his pace to skip past the United midfielder but the 19-year-old's challenge is mistimed and costs him a card. It's Izzy Brown again. The England under 19 international rides two challenges and takes aim from 20 yards out on the right of the penalty area. His crisp strike goes wide but narrowly misses the United woodwork. Well as soon as I speak there is a chance. Kasey Palmer capitalises on a poor United clearance to take fire from the edge of the box but his effort is comfortably saved by Victor Valdes. The reason why you haven't heard much in terms of chances is due to the lack of width in the game. Both sides are determined to play down the middle but have thus far failed to find the intricate pass. Ashley Young is on the deck again and it's nasty. Chelsea skipper Houghton is lucky not to pick up a second booking after his lunge on Young lands right on the winger's ankle. That must have hurt! Well it's been a quiet night so far for Victor Valdes in the United goal but a couple of clearances have kept the 33-year-old on his toes . Izzy Brown is impressing with his link up play for the Blues but the majority of the play is in the middle of the park as both sides are struggling for momentum and penetration going forward . Jordan Houghton is the first in the book after the Blues captain takes down Young. The United winger is getting numerous hard hits from the Chelsea youngsters but this one was deemed a step too far. Liam Grimshaw then quickly follows into the book for a late challenge for United. After quarter of an hour it's Chelsea who are dominating possession and managing to stretch the United defence . The away side win a corner and Andreas Christensen is presented with the game's best chance thus far. Tyler Blackett fails to deal with the Chelsea delivery and the ball falls to the Dane from eight yards out but he fires wide from a tight angle. It's getting spicy already. Chelsea's Fankaty Dabo is clearly not intimidated coming up against an England international as he clatters into Ashley Young with the pair exchanging a few feisty words. Andreas Pereira swings in a smart ball for the hosts from the right but his cross evades the United frontline. Rafael leaves Victor Valdes in the lurch with a miss-cued back pass, which the Spaniard can't prevent going for an early corner. Chelsea lead the Under 21 Premier League but the hosts can top the table with a win of a two-goal margin or more . Chelsea start proceedings with the kick-off... Three-time Champions League winner Victor Valdes has gone from the Nou Camp to Leigh Sports Village Stadium... All 11 of the Chelsea starting line-up are FA Youth Cup winners with the Blues . Chelsea starting XI: Beeney; Dabo, Christensen, Clarke-Salter, Dasilva; Colkett, Houghton (c), Palmer; Brown, Solanke, Musonda . Chelsea substitutes: Conroy, Collins, Abraham, Aina, Wright . It's an experienced side from the Red Devils with former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes between the sticks and England international Ashley Young within the ranks. Manchester United starting XI: Valdes; Rafael, Thorpe, Blackett, James; Harrop, Grimshaw, A. Pereira, Young; Powell, Fletcher . Manchester United substitutes: J.

"Parents could be banned from parking near their children’s school and fined up to £100 if they disobey. From next month, town halls will be given sweeping powers to outlaw any activity which may have a ‘detrimental effect’ on the quality of local life. Ministers insist so-called public spaces protection orders (PSPOs) are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and aggressive begging. Scroll down for video . Parents could be banned from parking near their children's school and fined up to £100 if they disobey . But the rules have been so widely drawn that councils are planning to apply them to ‘nuisance parking’, ball games in public car parks and even ‘inappropriate dress’. Anyone flouting the order will be liable for an on-the-spot fine, normally between £70 and £100, from a police officer, PCSO, council worker or security guard employed by the town hall. Refusing to pay will be a criminal offence that can land the person in court. The Manifesto Club think-tank asked a string of council enforcement teams how they plan to use the legislation. Examples included prohibiting parking outside schools. Streets close to the entrance would be  made ‘no parking’ areas for non-residents at drop-off and pick- up times. A zone would most likely be designated after complaints from nearby residents. The think-tank said it had been told parking in front of a home with a ‘for sale’ sign may be banned, as well as busking, begging, skateboarding and ball games. Councils are also considering restricting when ‘chuggers’ – charity collectors – can operate in town centres. Authorities in areas popular for stag and hen parties told researchers they may use the powers to outlaw ‘inappropriate dress’. The British Nudist Society said it was concerned about bans on beaches. From next month, town halls will be given sweeping powers to outlaw any activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life - including playing all games in public places . Josie Appleton, Manifesto Club director, said: ‘The possibilities for the use of these powers are endless … PSPOs amount to a blank cheque for councils to ban anything that is unusual or unpopular, or with which officials disagree.’ Lib Dem peer Timothy Clement-Jones, who hopes to get busking exempted from PSPOs, said he feared they would be used in a ‘heavy-handed’ way. He added: ‘These are very  wide-ranging powers and it is  vital that it is made very clear  to local authorities that they  should have proper grounds for invoking them.’ PSPOs replace three existing powers: gating orders to close alleys used for anti-social behaviour; designated public place orders confiscating alcohol; and dog control orders that ban dogs or require them to be on leads. Anyone flouting the order will be liable for an on-the-spot fine, normally between £70 and £100, from a police officer, PCSO, council worker or security guard employed by the town hall. Refusing to pay will be a criminal offence that can land the person in court . But the new legislation, in force from October 20, can regulate any activities in public spaces which the local authority believes have a ‘detrimental effect on the quality of life of those in the locality’ – or is likely to do so. The Manifesto Club said while the scope of the orders is similar to that of bylaws, they can be obtained much more easily. Bylaws must go through a democratic process and be sanctioned by  the secretary of state, while PSPOs are made in a summary manner  by councils. A Manifesto Club report warns the range of activities that could be deemed detrimental is ‘extremely broad’, adding: ‘One person’s favourite busker could be another person’s awful racket.’ Once an order is imposed, any appeal to the High Court must be made within six weeks. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said the Home Office wanted the orders to tackle anti-social behaviour rather than parking and that councils had been given this advice.","The orders were intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour .
So called PSPOs were used for behaviour like spitting and begging .
But councils are now planning to roll them out to ‘nuisance parking’, ball games in public car parks and even ‘inappropriate dress’"
"From admiring Lassie's intelligence  to cooing over the puppies in 101 Dalmatians, experts have found that films significantly influence the popularity of dog breeds chosen as pets. And the effect can last for up to a decade, with the general success of the films mirroring the amount of a specific breed purchased. For example, the 1943 blockbuster Lassie Come Home triggered a 40 per cent increase of collie registrations over the following two years. The effect of doggie films such as The Shaggy Dog and Lassie (pictured) can effect the breeds of dogs that owners choose as pets for up to 10 years after their release, a study claims. These graphs show how Old English Sheepdogs, Collies, Dalmatians and other breeds soared in popularity after people saw the films (pictured right). Many people bought St Bernards after seeing Beethoven, but their popularity was short-lived . An even more dramatic example was the 100-fold increase in Old English Sheepdog registrations following the 1959 Disney movie The Shaggy Dog. The influence of films on people’s choice of dog was strongest in the early 20th century and has since declined - but people still rushed out to buy St Bernard dogs after the 1992 film Beethoven. Researchers used data from the American Kennel Club - which maintains the world’s largest dog registry totalling over 65 million dogs - for their study. They looked at 87 films featuring dogs, The Shaggy Dog, Lassie Come Home, 101 Dalmatians, The Incredible Journey and Beethoven. The scientists found that the release of films is often associated to an increase in popularity of featured breeds over periods of one, two, five and ten years. However, some films bucked the trend, with the number of people choosing Cocker Spaniels, for example falling after seeing the original version of Lady and the Tramp . This graph shows how the top 10 films affected the purchase of Dalmatians and Collies among other breeds and how the overall influence of films lessens over the years . The number of people choosing Dalmatians as pets soared dramatically as shown in this graph from the study (pictured left) after the release of the film in 1985 (illustration pictured right) Scinetists found the 1943 blockbuster Lassie Come Home triggered a 40 per cent increase of Collie registrations over the following two years. A still from the 2005 Lassie film is pictured . The was the 100-fold increase in Old English Sheepdog registrations following the 1959 Disney movie The Shaggy Dog. The poster for the recent re-make is pictured left and an image of the breed, right . They also discovered that the trends correlated with the how many people had seen the film on its opening weekend. Viewing a movie may cause a long-lasting preference for a breed that can be expressed years later, when the time comes to buy a new dog, the study suggests. The research was carried out by scientists from the University of Bristol, the City University of New York, and Western Carolina University and published in the journal PLOS One. The 10 films with the strongest effect over a decade saw more than 800,000 dogs in total registered in the decade after their breed starred in a popular film. ‘We focused on changes in trend popularity rather than on popularity itself to avoid attributing to movies trends that were already ongoing before movie release, as up-trending breeds may have been chosen more often for movies,’ study lead author Professor Stefano Ghirlanda explained. The influence of films on people’s choice of dog was strongest in the early 20th century and has since declined, but this graph shows the effect across the 87 films studied by the researchers, demonstrating that people are swayed by which breeds are popular in the media . There was a vast rise in the number of St Bernard dogs  chosen as pets in the five years following  the popular film, Beethoven released in 1992 (pictured left) - but the trend declined again afterwards with only a slight rise in popularity for the breed shown in a  decade (pictured in the graph, right) They looked at 87 films featuring dogs, The Shaggy Dog, Lassie Come Home, 101 Dalmatians, The Incredible Journey  and Beethoven. After cinema goers watched the original Incredible Journey in 1963, the popularity of Retrievers (pictured centre) soared, while they fell after seeing the more modern version (still pictured) The team discovered a general decrease during the century of movies’ influence on the success of dog breeds. Earlier movies are associated with generally larger trend changes than later films and the researchers said this might be due to an increased competition with other media, such as television, and more recently, the internet, - but also increased competition among movies. Movies featuring dogs were released at a rate of less than one per year until about 1940, but a rate of more than seven per year by 2005. The researchers had previously shown how dynamics in dog breed popularity are subject to the ‘erratic fluctuations’ typical of fashion and fads. Surprisingly, Lady and The Tramp (film poster pictured left) was among the movies that saw the popularity of certain breeds decrease. Less people registered Cocker Spaniels (Lady's breed)  as pets than they did before watching the original 1955 film . Viewing a movie may cause a long-lasting preference for a breed that can be expressed years later, when the time comes to buy a new dog, the study suggests. There have been a number of 101 Dalmatians films since the first was released in 161 and saw a huge rise in the popularity of the breed . There has been a rise in the number of 'Wolf breed' dogs such as huskies up for adoption in pet rehoming centres. The trend has been blamed on the Twilight films and Game of Thrones as people rushed out to buy a puppy, not realising how energetic the breeds can be. Blue Cross, which cares for ill and abandoned pets, said the number of huskies and similar breeds taken to its 12 rehoming centres across the UK had increased by 700 per cent over the past five years. Animal charity Dogs Trust has a total of 34 Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies at its 19 rehoming centres. Lynn Barber, its head of training and behaviour, said yesterday: ‘These dogs are beautiful creatures and can make wonderful companions, but they need owners who understand the demands of this breed and are in a position to offer a lifetime commitment.’ For example, they discovered that the more rapidly puppy registrations increased, the more rapidly their popularity declined, a phenomena also found for the popularity of baby names. The study demonstrated that the popularity of breeds is unrelated to breed temperament and health. Hal Herzog, co-author of the paper, said: ‘On the whole, breeds with more desirable behaviours, greater longevity, and fewer inherited genetic disorders did not become more popular than other breeds. ‘In short, cultural shifts in types of pets largely reflect ephemeral changes in fashion rather than selection for functional traits.” Dr Alberto Acerbi, of Bristol University, said: ‘If people buy en masse dogs because they appear in movies the consequences can be negative for the dogs themselves. ‘Our previous study found that the most popular breeds had the greatest number of inherited disorders. It’s not surprising that we tend to follow social cues and fashions, as this is a quite effective strategy in many situations. ‘However, in particular cases the outcomes can be negative. When choosing a new pet, we may want to act differently.’ There has been a rise in the number of 'Wolf breed' dogs such as huskies up for adoption in pet rehoming centres and the trend has been blamed on the Twilight films (illustrated) as well as TV series Game of Thrones .","Effect can last for up to a decade and is correlated with the general success of the films, a study led by the University of Bristol claims .

He has always got that about him when he goes up with his hands a lot. ‘It is tough to say that he does it deliberately, but with the Van Persie one, I think he had a look at me first and then he has gone for me.

"Brendan Rodgers has revealed Raheem Sterling has been offered a 'wonderful deal' and warned the player's advisors that Liverpool will not be held to ransom over his future. The England international has yet to agree new terms after talks stalled  for a number of months. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said at the weekend it was imperative that the futures of Sterling and Jordan Henderson, Liverpool's vice captain, were sorted out quickly to end any lingering uncertainty about their futures. Brendan Rodgers has revealed Raheem Sterling has been offered a 'wonderful deal' at Liverpool . The England international has yet to agree new terms but talks have been stalling . Sterling has just over  two years left on his current deal while Henderson is in the final 18 months of his terms, but Rodgers is confident that both issues will get finalised sooner rather than later. Liverpool's manager has, though, made it clear that the terms offered to Sterling are both generous and reflect his position at the club. 'Steven is relaying what the club is wanting. Both players are very important for the future. I'm sure it will be resolved fairly soon,' he said. Liverpool manager Rodgers says Liverpool won't be held to ransom over a new deal for Sterling . 'Raheem is going to get rewarded. He has been offered a wonderful deal, an incredible deal for a young player. He is very happy here and you can see that in his play. 'We are certainly not going to be a club that gives out way, way above what they are worth. We reward our best players. 'It is very important for young players to have something to strive for and if they get too much too soon it will sabotage their development. Raheem has been outstanding since he was put in the team but you have to remember this was a 17-year-old who was put into the team. 'We believe this is the best place for him. But you have to leave something there for the next one for them to progress.' Sterling has just over two years left on his current deal at Liverpool .

"It is photo in which German artist Andreas Gursky wanted to capture a desolate but ‘accurate image of a modern river’. He even turned to computer trickery to remove any intrusive features – dog walkers, cyclists, a factory building – until it was bleak enough to satisfy him. And while it is hard to argue that he has achieved his aim - it is even harder to see why someone would pay a substantial sum of money to own the piece. But the digitally altered - and some might say visually uninteresting - 'Rhine II' has become the most expensive photograph ever sold at auction.

"It may be one of the most stylish uniforms in the skies, but Virgin Atlantic’s cabin crew have been getting a bit hot under the collar about their new look. The striking red outfits were designed by Vivienne Westwood and launched to much fanfare on September 1. But the airline's crew members have since complained that the uniforms are too tight and that the shoes give them blisters. Red alert: The new uniforms were handed out to over 7,500 Virgin Atlantic staff in September . The uniform features a double-breasted ‘drape coat’, which can be worn fastened or open . Staff also complained that the skirts are too high-waisted and don't fit properly, while the collars are so tight they make them bleed, according to union Unite. A Unite spokesperson told The Sun: ‘We’ve had members complaining of poor comfort and injury caused by the new uniform and mainly as a result of blistering from shoes and garment fit.’ But Virgin Atlantic said the initial feedback from staff had been 'fantastic' and that the uniform could be tailored to fit all shapes and sizes. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Virgin Atlantic is extremely excited to launch its new uniform collection and initial feedback from staff has been fantastic . 'To ensure the uniform was fit for purpose across our network, we conducted wearer trials globally for six months with over 150 staff volunteers who provided daily feedback on the fabric, fit, practicality and wearability of the uniform. 'Adjustments were then made accordingly before the designs and fabrics were finalised. 'We recognise that the fit is different to the previous uniform and to ensure correct sizing, all staff tried on the uniform and were fitted by our expert team upon collection. We have uniforms available in sizes from 6 to 30 and garments can be tailored to fit all shapes and sizes.' Fanfare: Virgin Atlantic's boss Sir Richard Branson hosted a launch party for the new uniforms in July . VIP guests: Singer Debbie Harry and Vivienne Westwood joined Sir Richard Branson at the launch party . Sir Richard Branson’s airline launched the new uniforms at a star-studded party in July. Among the guests at the event in London were former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, Bond girl Naomi Harris, singer Debbie Harry and Vivienne Westwood herself. The uniforms were made using recycled polyester clothing and took inspiration from some of Westwood’s most iconic pieces. Female cabin crew wear a red pencil skirt, with a double pleat at the back, and a dramatic asymmetric frill-front blouse. The look is completed by a red jacket with a nipped in waist and high collar that was inspired by Westwood’s early 90s 'Bettina' jacket. There is also a double-breasted ‘drape coat’ with an oversized collar, which can be worn fastened or open. The red shoe worn by female crew is available in three heights. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: 'We understand the importance of comfortable footwear therefore the shoes were trialled extensively on the ground and in the air. 'We offer a choice of low, medium and high heels for the women and based on feedback, looking to bring in a wider-fitting shoe. However, with all leather footwear, it will take time for them to wear in and be comfortable.' The hand-drawn wing designs are a recurring theme across all members of the team and male crew members wear a Savile Row-inspired three piece suit in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool. Going green: The stylish new uniforms were made using recycled polyester clothing . Male crew members wear a Savile Row-inspired three piece suit in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool . Over 7,500 staff including cabin crew, pilots, Clubhouse staff and Virgin Holidays employees received the new uniform consisting of 22 pieces in total. On a blog on its website, Virgin Atlantic said the uniforms were 'comfortable and practical' and had undergone a trial before their introduction on September 1. It also stated that staff provided feedback after each flight or shift so that adjustments could be made ahead of the full launch. The uniform was assessed on 'fit, comfort, breathability, ease of movement, creasing before and after the shift, look and feel of the uniform after laundering and how the uniform handles marks and stains'. Virgin Atlantic said: 'We take all feedback very seriously and are working really hard with our uniform wearers to offer a uniform they feel proud to wear and to ensure they are happy and comfortable in their working environment.'","Striking Vivienne Westwood uniforms were launched on September 1 .

"The adult film industry in Los Angeles was shut down on Thursday after another porn performer's HIV test came back positive. The moratorium will last until 'all performers who the positive performer worked with or had sexual contact with test negative' according to guidelines set by the adult film industry trade group. This is the third such moratorium imposed in the last year. Scroll down for video . Another porn moratorium: An adult film performer has tested positive for HIV. It is the first such occurrence for the industry in 2014, though three performers tested positive for the virus in 2013 . 'We take the health of our performers very seriously and felt that it was better to err on the side of caution while we determine whether anyone else may have been exposed,' Diane Duke of the Freedom of Speech Coalition wrote in a release. The moratorium calls for an immediate halt to all productions until further notice. The last moratorium ended last September, at which point performers became required to test for HIV and other STIs every 14 days instead of every 28. Prior to that, a performer who goes by the name Cameron Bay made national headlines when she tested positive for HIV followed by her adult film actor boyfriend. The moratorium ended after one week. Performers in Los Angeles county have been legally required to wear condoms since 2012. Shoots in the porn capital have plummeted since the enactment of the law . This is the industry's first reported case of HIV in 2014 after three in 2013. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which successfully fought to require condoms for porn actors in Los Angeles city and county, calls it 'tragic' repeat of last year's cases and says it underscores the need for statewide action. The county requirement has reportedly caused the number of porn shoots in Los Angeles, an area where the industry once famously flourished, to plummet. Only 20 filmmakers had applied for permits as of the start of August, according to Film LA, which issues them. Last year 40 adult filmmakers took out permits, compared with 485 in 2012, the last year before the ordinance took effect.","The unnamed performer's HIV status is not yet confirmed but all filming in Los Angeles was put on hold Thursday .

"An ex-General Electric employee from New York has been indicted on federal charges of plotting to use a weapon of mass destruction. Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, was arrested with Eric Feight, 54, in June after the FBI alleged the pair tried to sell a homemade weapon of mass destruction to Jewish groups and a branch of the KKK. The men are accused of trying to create a remote controlled weapon that would emit radioactive waves that would cause those around the device to die from radiation poisoning within days. Charges: Glendon Crawford, seen at an Albany court last year, has been indicted for conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction . Lethal: The alleged plot involved remotely firing a death ray that would kill victims with radiation poisoning . On Thursday a federal grand jury charged Crawford was attempting to produce and use a radiological device, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, and distribution of information relating to weapons of mass destruction. Crawford's role was to design and build the radiation device and its power supply, according to a federal complaint. Crawford allegedly planned to turn an industrial-grade X-ray machine into a remote-controlled laser gun. The laser gun would be mounted in a truck and driven to an area near the intended victims. After . parking the truck, the driver would leave the scene and activate the . laser via a remote control from about half a mile away. Everyone near the truck would receive a lethal dose of radiation and die within two weeks of the attack. The FBI says the device would have worked if it had been completed. The remote controlled aspect of the . device had been tested, but a radiation source had not been secured, . according to the FBI report seen by the Times Union. The . FBI started investigating Crawford in April 2012, after he allegedly . approached Schenectady's Congregation Gates of Heaven synagogue. He allegedly 'asked to speak . with a person who might be willing to help him with a type of . technology that could be used by Israel to defeat its enemies, . specifically, by killing Israel's enemies while they slept'. The same day, the married industrial mechanic allegedly called an Albany Jewish group to make a similar offer. An official at the synagogue contacted police, who informed the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Crawford . and Feight were arrested in June after the FBI used undercover . informants posing as members of a KKK group who were interested in funding the . weapon. Crawford had allegedly approached a senior member of a KKK group to ask for funding. The contact had then informed the FBI. The alleged weapon had not been finished, but the FBI report said the pair planned to hide the converted X-ray system in a truck, according to ABC News. The device would have been detonated using the vehicle's cigarette lighter, the report claimed. Feight, who was allegedly going to design and build the remote-controlled detonator, has not been indicted, but is under a federal complaint.

"A poster advertising Rihanna’s perfume Rogue has been banned in areas where children are likely to see it because it presents the pop star in a 'sexually suggestive' way. The advert features an image of the Barbados-born singer sitting on the floor with her head and shoulders leaning against a wall and her legs raised against a large bottle of perfume. The Advertising Standards Agency said it imposed a placement restriction on the poster, which was produced on behalf of perfume company Parlux Fragrances, after a single complaint that it was offensively sexual, demeaning to women and featured images not suitable for children to see. Scroll down for video . Unsuitable: The restricted advert features an image Rihanna sitting on the floor with her head and shoulders leaning against a wall and her legs raised against a large bottle of perfume . Parlux Fragrances said they had received no other complaints, adding that Rihanna was known for her provocative songs and persona, which the advert sought to capture . The company said it had done so without featuring improper nudity or offensive or suggestive imagery, adding that the majority of women would not consider the photo of Rihanna demeaning. Rather, they claim, Rihanna is depicted as being in a position of power, as indicated by the name Rogue, which the company claims suggests 'one with the courage to challenge boundaries'. The Advertising Standards Authority noted that the image showed Rihanna wearing clothes, and showed her looking directly at the viewer with an expression 'of defiance rather than vulnerability'. It said the overall impression of the singer was one of confidence, and concluded that the ad was 'unlikely to be demeaning to women or to cause serious or widespread offence'. Controversy: The Advertising Standards Agency said a single complaint was made saying Rihanna's advert was offensively sexual, demeaning to women and featured images not suitable for children . Parlux Fragrances said Rihanna was known for her provocative songs and persona. On Monday the singer left nothing to the imagination in a racy dress at the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards . However it noted that the advert was not given a placement restriction and had appeared in a number of places where it was likely to be seen by children. In a statement the Advertising Standards Authority said: 'While we did not consider the image to be overtly sexual, we considered that Rihanna’s pose, with her legs raised in the air, was provocative.' 'Because of this, and the fact that Rihanna appeared to be naked except for high heels, we concluded that the ad was sexually suggestive and should have been given a placement restriction to reduce the possibility of it being seen by children.' It ruled that the ad must not appear again without a placement restriction to reduce the possibility of it being seen by children. Not the first time: To promote her perfume 'Rebelle' in June 2012, this large poster showing a completely nude Rihanna was erected in New York's Times Square .

'Nude', another perfume released later that year, featured an advert showing Rihanna wearing nothing but cream lace lingerie, a piece of gauze fabric draped strategically over her crotch. She posted the image on her Twitter account, accompanied by the caption: 'Make sure you smell sexy, especially naked, this fall.' Also in 2012 the cosmetic tycoon Stefan Heidenreich - the head of Nivea’s parent firm Beiersdorf - complained that the brand had been tainted by the singer promoting its products. Branding her 'too sexy', Heidenreich said the singer should have been considered a 'no go' for the brand’s family image.

"Malala Yousafzai is to have a book published which will tell the story of how she was shot by the Taliban and her long-running campaign to promote children's education . A 15-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban as she returned home from school has signed a book deal worth a reported £2m. Malala Yousafzai's book will tell the story about the traumatic event and her long-running campaign to promote children's education. Publisher Weidenfeld and Nicolson announced that it would release 'I Am Malala' in Britain and Commonwealth countries in the autumn. Little, Brown and Co. will publish the 15-year-old's memoir in the United States and much of the rest of the world. A Taliban gunman shot Malala last October in north western Pakistan. The militant group said it targeted her because she promoted 'Western thinking' and, through a blog, had been an outspoken critic of the Taliban's opposition to educating girls. The shooting sparked outrage in Pakistan and many other countries, and her story drew global attention to the struggle for women's rights in Malala's homeland. The teen even made the shortlist for Time magazine's 'Person of the Year' in 2012. The teenager said she hoped telling her story would be 'part of the campaign to give every boy and girl the right to go to school.' 'I hope the book will reach people around the world, so they realize how difficult it is for some children to get access to education,' she said. 'I want to tell my story, but it will also be the story of 61 million children who can't get education.' The Guardian has reported the book deal to be worth £2 million.

"A packed jumbo jet experienced such extreme turbulence that nine passengers and a cabin crew member were injured, an accident report for Virgin Atlantic has revealed. The London-bound Boeing 747 ran into extreme turbulence after the pilots' study of weather radar returns led them to alter course to avoid bad weather on their intended route. The radar monitoring by the pilots 'appeared to indicate a line of weather across the aircraft's intended track', said the report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). Scroll down for video . The Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the Boeing 747 ran into turbulence when trying to avoid bad weather no a flight from Jamaica to London . Having altered course, crew and passengers ran into 'a brief period of severe turbulence' with the injured crew member and two of the injured passengers later being treated in hospital. The aircraft, which had 400 passengers on board, safely landed at Gatwick, but one of the passengers suffered a knee injury and the cabin crew member, who was in the crew rest area at the time, had head and neck injuries. At one point the turbulence was so severe that a stewardess had difficulty securing herself in her harness, the report says. Most passengers were already seated with their seatbelts fastened and all those who suffered injury were in the rear, right side of the plane. The incident happened in the early hours of November 14 last year when the aircraft, which had taken off from Montego Bay in Jamaica, was around 345 miles south of St John's in Newfoundland. After their monitoring of the weather radar, the pilots had requested a deviation to the left, (north), to avoid the weather. This was not approved but a deviation to the right of track was, and the crew altered course. The report said the wind at this stage was from astern, 'so the crew were not concerned that their new track would be downwind of the observed weather and thus possibly subject to turbulence'. The AAIB said that as the aircraft flew on, 'returns on the radar reduced and disappeared altogether'. The flight had taken off from Montego Bay in Jamaica and was heading for the UK when the incident happened . But turbulence then started and there were 'significant climbs and descents'. Once it was over, the cabin crew attended to the injured passengers and crew member, assisted by medically-qualified volunteers from among the passengers. After the plane landed, medical staff came on board and treated the injured passengers. In another incident reported by the AAIB, severe turbulence aboard a Dash 8 aircraft being flown from Birmingham to Belfast City Airport led to a stewardess being seriously injured. She was knocked off her feet during the flight on the morning of February 7 this year. She was treated by a doctor who was travelling as a passenger and later taken to hospital. One of the 71 passengers on board also suffered a minor injury.","Air Accidents Investigation Branch report says three were later hospitalised .

"Many people might associate roses with romance novels, but in fact the smell of chocolate tempts readers to buy loved-up fiction. Researchers at Antwerp University in Belgium found that while a chocolatey smell makes people hungry to buy romance novels, it does not necessarily tempt people to buy grittier genres such as crime or business books. The scientists, who permeated a bookshop with the perfume of chocolate, also found that the scent encouraged customers to browse through titles. The government funded study found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel if they smelt chocolate - and the same results applied to cookery books too . They studied the behaviour of 201 customers in a popular chain bookshop over ten days to find that customers were 3.5 times more likely to pick up romance novels when they smelt chocolate, The Guardian reported. The government funded study also found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel - and the same results applied to cookery books too. Belgium scientists found the smell of chocolate makes people buy romance books written by novelists such as Dame Barbara Cartland (pictured) Lieve Douché, who led the study told the newspaper: 'When consumers smell chocolate, concepts . associated with chocolate, such as cooking, become more readily . accessible to the consumer's mind and cause consumers to react . differently when encountering a cookbook than if they had not smelled . chocolate.' The researchers concluded romance, food and drink books were strongly linked with the smell of chocolate, but other categories of literature were not, such as comic and graphic novels, travel, art, gardening, crime, law and business books. However, perhaps sue to the scent encouraging customers to browse and deviate from their usual purchasing habits, sales of the 'incongruent' books also increased, with customers 1.2 times more likely to buy any of the books on offer in the chain bookshop. Previous research has found that the smell of chocolate has a positive effect on a person's mood, sparking feelings of pleasure or even arousal when shopping for goods. The Belgium study said: 'The presence of a chocolate scent has a . positive influence on general approach behaviour and a negative impact . on goal-directed behaviour in the store.' Retail experts already exploit customers' sense of smell to influence their attention span and buying behaviour. The new research has taken it a step further by marrying a specific scent with products - even if the books themselves do not have a distinctive smell.","Belgium scientists flooded a bookshop with a chocolatey smell to find customers were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel .

"Republican revelers at a summer barbecue watched in horror as a small plane performing an aerial stunt crashed and burst into flames, killing the pilot. Randy Humble was said to be throwing toilet paper out the window of his Lake Amphibian airplane on Saturday, when witnesses said they heard the plane’s engine revving loudly and it suddenly dropped out of view. The aircraft crashed in an open field near the picnic in Viola, Idaho, killing the 60-year-old pilot. Tragic: Randy Humble's Lake Amphibian airplane crashed in an open field near a picnic in Viola, Idaho, killing the 60-year-old pilot . Humble was the only occupant of the plane. He was a well-known businessman who owned a local construction company in Moscow, Idaho, Humble Homes, and was known by many of those attending the Summer Barbecue for the Latah County Republicans, according to a Latah County Sheriff spokesman. ‘He had been around here a long time,’ the spokesman said, ‘for the people at the picnic it was pretty tragic when they saw his plane crash.’ Humble's plane was one of two aircrafts that were performing for the event. Sudden drop: Humble's plane had attempted an aerial stunt but then fell out of the sky . The second plane, described as a small . Piper Cub aircraft, had performed a low altitude stall just minutes . before Humble seemed to try and replicate the move. Walter Steed, Chairman of the Latah . County Republican Party, witnessed the incident and said it looked as if . Humble's plane was just not equipped to perform that kind of stunt. 'I was standing there watching,' Steed . said, '[Humble's plane] just fell off to the side, I was hoping that there was a deeper . canyon and that he would have enough altitude to recover but he . didn’t.' Raging flames: Guests at the picnic rushed to the crash site and tried to control the flames with fire extinguishers . A local news station, KHQ-TV, reported that Humble appeared to be throwing toilet paper out of his plane window shortly before the crash and Steed said he believed the paper was the pilot's attempt to make a streamer. FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer only said that Humble’s airplane ‘stalled while dropping something at a gathering and crashed.’ Both the FAA and NTSB are now investigating the accident. Community: Farm equipment was brought in to control the flames in the pasture where the plane crashed . A coterie of 60 to 70 people were gathered on an outdoor deck enjoying the air show when the plane suddenly dropped. ‘We did not see it hit, we saw it . fall off to the right, into a rolling ridge and behind some trees ... but . we heard it,' Steed explained. Several guests jumped in their . vehicles and rushed to the crash site. They attempted to use fire extinguishers to . control the flames, but they soon ran out. Then local farm equipment was brought in to keep the fire from spreading in the pasture where the plane had crashed and people used blankets to beat down flames. Shock: Close to 60 to 70 guests were gathered for the Summer Barbecue for the Latah County Republicans when the tragedy occurred . Guests had gathered on . Saturday in Viola, a town with a population of just a few hundred . people, for the local GOP shindig. The party, held at a private residence, kicked off at 4pm and was just getting in full swing when the tragedy occurred around 5:30pm. The air show had been arranged by the owners of the home where the party was held and the local Republican group was not involved in the air show's planning. The outdoor event was billed as the highlight of the local GOP’s fall social calendar - offering live music, a guest speaker, ‘time for visiting and lots of good food,’ according to the group’s website. Candidates running for the state legislature and for the County Commissioner's Office were in attendance. 'Things got pretty quiet,' Steed said about the mood after the tragedy, 'We were going to have candidate speeches but after the crash, that was the end.'","Pilot believed to have used toilet paper to make a streamer .

"With just over seven months to go until he becomes a father for the second time, the Duke of Cambridge has clearly decided some extra help is required. During an investiture at Windsor Castle, a 'charming' Prince William asked one of the nation’s most senior midwives if she would like to 'come and help' him and his wife. Professor Lesley Page, president of the Royal College of Midwives spoke to the royal about the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy when he presented her with a CBE. Scroll down for video . Proud: Professor Lesley Page, who said Prince William spoke about Kate's pregnancy, with her CBE . 'Well I’m a midwife so he talked about Catherine’s pregnancy,' explained Professor Page following the investiture. 'We talked about my being a midwife for well over 30 years and what’s changed, and what I’m doing now after becoming president of the Royal College of Midwives.' Asked whether she gave the prince any advice, she said: 'I almost said to him the second is much easier but I don’t think I quite got that out. 'He actually said to me, ""Would you like to come and help us?""' Unsurprisingly, Professor Page's response was: 'Yes, of course.' Professor Page received her CBE for services to midwifery and delightedly told journalists afterwards that she is 'very proud' of her profession. Help for Kate: According to Professor Page, William asked her to 'come and help' Kate during her pregnancy . Thrilled: Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland and Mrs Emma Saysell were invested with MBEs at the same time . Speaking about meeting William at what was the first investiture ceremony he has held at Windsor Castle, the professor said he was 'very charming', adding: 'and he said he was well looked after by midwives'. The Duchess of Cambridge, who is pregnant with her second child, is being treated for hyperemesis gravidarum, a form of acute morning sickness. As a result, Kate has not been seen in public since the news of a second royal baby was announced and has had to scale back her engagements on the advice of doctors. But although William was happy to discuss the royal pregnancy with Professor Page, she revealed that he said nothing about she is currently doing. Yesterday the duchess sent a message of support to a children’s art therapy charity after having to cancel a visit.

She had hoped to attend the launch of The Clore Art Room at Barlby Primary School in London. In a message read out at the school on her behalf, the Duchess said she was 'truly sorry' to have missed the launch. Others receiving awards at the ceremony today included head coach of the Wales rugby team Warren Gatland who was awarded an OBE, the headteacher of Wellington College Sir Anthony Seldon who received a knighthood, and former football referee David Elleray who received an MBE. During the ceremony, William chose not to stand on a riser  as he wanted to make it more comfortable for the recipients, according to a royal spokesman. Hyperemesis gravidarum afflicts one in 50 pregnancies and is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers. The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. Pregnant mothers expecting twins are often more likely to suffer the condition, due to the higher levels of hormones in their system. Miss Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline 'twice the hormones' often means 'twice the sickness'. She said: 'The condition is extremely common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'It is associated with the changes in hormonal levels in the body, where the pregnancy hormones are quite high and it is the effect of those on the expectant mother. 'If anything it is associated with a normal, healthy pregnancy. Every so often, in extreme cases it is necessary to scan the mother to see if she could be expecting twins. 'In twins expectant mothers experience twice the hormones, and so often twice the sickness.' She said the condition is usually diagnosed around the six week mark and in most cases carries on until 12 weeks. 'The majority of ladies feel much better after 12 weeks, but a small group do carry on suffering the symptoms well into their second trimester, up to 24 weeks,' Miss Hanna told MailOnline. Hyperemesis gravidarum leads to severe dehydration and puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients. Sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences. They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week. This can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food. Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated. In less severe cases the condition can be managed with supplementary hydration, medication and nurtrients. Some women take vitamin B6 – which prevents sickness – as soon as they know they are pregnant. Others may take stronger anti-nausea tablets such as cyclizine, which is also used to treat travel sickness and is said to be very effective. Sufferers are advised to take plenty of fluids and try to have small snacks throughout the day as an empty stomach can trigger nausea. If they cannot keep food down they will need anti-sickness medication and to be put on a drip. Miss Hanna said Kate is more susceptible to suffering hyperemesis gravidarum, having endured the acute sickness during her pregnancy with Prince George. She said: 'If you have suffered this condition before, it is more likely you will again. 'If you have already reacted once to the raised hormone levels in the way she has, it is quite normal during subsequent pregnancies.' She said in most cases pregnant women are given advice to avoid spicy foods and eat a diet of bland food including toast, bananas and mashed potato, little and often. 'Women suffering the condition are at risk of dehydration and so we often advise they keep their water levels up and avoid fizzy drinks,' said Miss Hanna. 'For the majority of women these simple measures will make them feel better, but in some more extreme cases we would prescribe anti-sickness medication, something like Stemetil or Maxolon (metoclopramide). 'If, despite everything, the expectant mother is not keeping anything down, and is suffering bloating, they are often taken into hospital where they can be closely monitored, given regular fluids and more regular anti-sickness drugs. 'In very extreme cases, steroids can be given.' Hyperemesis gravidarum can cause serious complications for mother and baby. Those who are hospitalised, as the Duchess was with Prince George, before 12 weeks are around 20 per cent more likely to be at risk of pre-eclampsia, according to some studies. But Miss Hanna, who has 35 years of experience and has been a consultant for the last 25 years, said the risk of any complications for Kate is reduced given the fact she did not experience any during her first pregnancy. She told MailOnline: 'She did very well during her first pregnancy, and as a result there is no reason to think anything will be different this time around. 'Second pregnancies are kinder and easier on the body, because the body has done it before. 'Kate will know what to expect and there is no reason she will face any complications.","William asked Professor Lesley Page for help during an investiture .

"'So lucky': Princess Eugenie, seen here at Royal Ascot, has earned a 2:1 in English literature and history of art from Newcastle University . Princess Eugenie is to join the queue of job-hunting graduates after being awarded a degree by Newcastle University. The Duke of York's younger daughter, who is sixth in line to the throne, earned a 2:1 in her combined English Literature and History of Art BA Honours, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday. The 22-year-old royal described her time in the North East as a 'fantastic experience' and her parents declared they were 'immensely proud' of her. Senior royal sources exclusively told the Mail tonight that she planned to get a job rather than become a full time royal and hoped to work 'in the art world'. 'Art is her love and she plans to look around and get as much experience in different fields before deciding which route to go down,' said one. 'She already has people keen to speak to her not least because of her results, which were very good indeed.' Eugenie achieved a First in her final year dissertation in history of art. The former Marlborough College student also has three good A levels under her belt - an A in each of English and art and a B in history of art. Eugenie's elder sister, Princess Beatrice, graduated from Goldsmiths in London last year also with a 2:1 in History and History of Ideas -  making them the brainiest siblings in the royal family. The Mail understands that Beatrice - who has battled dyslexia since she was a child - has also finally found a job herself a year after graduating. She is currently studying for her financial services exams and will start work at an as yet unnamed company in the industry in September. In a short statement Eugenie, who 'slummed' it in typical student digs while she was studying, said: 'Newcastle University has given me such an incredible three years. I have had a wonderful time in the North East, learning and having a fantastic experience. 'The staff and tutors at Newcastle have guided me through my years there and given me great support. I am so lucky to have spent time there. New adventures: Eugenie arrives at Newcastle University student induction to start her university life along with thousands of other freshers in September 2009 . 'I wish all the students graduating this year the very best of luck in the future.' Her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, who remain close after their divorce, issued a joint statement saying: 'Eugenie has worked incredibly hard to achieve this excellent result and we are immensely proud of what she has done, particularly gaining a first in her dissertation. 'She has had a wonderful time at Newcastle University and has greatly enjoyed her time in the North East.' Asked about Eugenie's plans for the future a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'She's considering her options like many graduates at the moment.' Delighted: The Duke and Duchess of York, pictured with Eugenie on her first day at school in 2001, said they were immensely proud of their daughter . Newcastle has long been popular with students from top public schools and the leafy suburb of Jesmond has been seen as an enclave for the young well-to-do. Former students include actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, singer Bryan Ferry and journalist Kate . As well as being a top-class student, Eugenie also has something of a reputation for partying. In recent weeks she has frequently been seen out on the town with her cousin, Prince Harry. At Marlborough she was said to be among a group of students seen celebrating the end of their exams by streaking through the grounds. She was also reported to have visited a lap dancing club in London with a group of friends when she was just 18. Controversially, she and her sister still receive round the clock police protection at an estimated cost of more than half a million pounds a year despite not being full-time working royals.","Princess read English literature and history of art .

"It’s one of the most frustrating challenges every passenger encounters when they board a plane – the mad dash to find a generous spot for their hand baggage. Placing luggage in the overhead lockers is often a tight squeeze as passengers skirt the rules with bags that barely fit, and it’s no surprise that some airlines are better than others when it comes to cabin baggage allowances. It turns out Spanish carrier Iberia is the most generous – allowing larger bags with no weight restrictions – while UK airlines Thomas Cook and Thomson and Dublin-based Ryanair are among the stingiest, according to a BBC survey. Room for everyone? Many passengers face a mad dash to find a generous spot for their hand luggage . With passengers bringing on larger and heavier bags to avoid surcharges for checked baggage, the dimensions and weight of allowable cabin luggage vary per airline and the rules aren’t always enforced by airline staff. The BBC’s survey of 17 major European airlines found that Iberia, British Airlines, Jet2 and Monarch Airlines all allow the largest bags – with dimensions of 22 x 17 x 9 inches (56 x 45 x 25 centimetres) for a fully-packed bag – but Iberia is the only one without a weight restriction. Size matters: Some airlines are more generous than others when it comes to cabin luggage allowances . Iberia: 22 x 17 x 9 inches, unlimited weight . British Airways: 22 x 17 x 9 inches, 50lbs . Jet2: 22 x 17 x 9 inches, 22lbs . Monarch Airways: 22 x 17 x 9 inches, 22lbs . Flybe: 21 x 15 x 9 inches, 22lbs . Norwegian Air: 21 x 15 x 9 inches, 22lbs . Lufthansa: 21 x 15 x 9 inches, 17lbs . Scandinavian Airlines: 21 x 15 x 9 inches, 17lbs . Air France: 21 x 13 x 9 inches, 26lbs . KLM: 21 x 13 x 9 inches, 26lbs . Virgin Atlantic: 22 x 14 x 9 inches, 22lbs . Ryanair: 21 x 15 x 7 inches, 22lbs . Air Berlin: 21 x 15 x 7 inches, 17lbs . Germanwings: 21 x 15 x 7 inches, 17lbs . Thomas Cook: 21 x 15 x 7 inches, 11lbs . Thomson: 21 x 15 x 7 inches, 11lbs . easyJet: 19 x 15 x 7 inches, unlimited weight . *easyJet will allow up to 22 x 17 x 9 inches . UK budget airline easyJet will allow a bag up to that size, but it will be placed in the luggage hold at no cost if there is not enough room for it. Otherwise, its dimensions are 19 x 15 x 7ins 50 x 40 x 20cms). The airline doesn’t have a weight limit. Ryanair, its chief rival, found itself near the bottom of the survey. The airline that is notorious for checked baggage fees as high as £75 allows bags as large as 21 x 15 x 7ins (55 x 40 x 20cms) with a maximum weight of 22lbs (10kg). 'Most generous': Spanish carrier Iberia allows larger bags and does not have a weight restriction . Frank Brehany, consumer director of HolidayTravelWatch, told the BBC that airline employees are not doing enough checks at the gate and that is putting the safety of passengers and crew in jeopardy. He said: ‘There have been occasions when consumers have reported an injury as a result of a heavy item falling down on arrival. ‘Others have been hurt because the owner cannot manage the weight of the bag. The weight can even cause the overhead bin to open.’","Spanish carrier Iberia allows larger bags with no weight restrictions .

"Sensitive: The controversial appointment had to be rubber-stamped by the Prime Minister David Cameron . Britain's top taxman – who stepped down after he was accused by MPs of lying – has been hired by HSBC to advise it on honesty, it emerged last night. In an explosive move, the bank has appointed Dave Hartnett, the former head of HM Revenue and Customs, as an adviser to ‘enforce the highest standards’ at the firm. The decision to recruit the 61-year-old, who retired last July, was so sensitive that the Prime Minister had to rubber-stamp the former civil servant’s new job. Mr Hartnett has pledged not to advise the bank on its tax affairs although he has permission to lobby the Government on behalf of his new employer after a two-year cooling-off period. The move triggered fury because Mr Hartnett was embroiled in a series of ‘sweetheart deals’ with firms such as Goldman Sachs which allowed them to slash their tax bills by millions. Last night, it emerged that he also had dealings with HSBC during his time at HMRC. In documents seen by the Daily Mail, David Cameron was advised that ‘while working in government Mr Hartnett had official dealings with HSBC over a number of years’. Scroll down for video . Deal: The banking giant last month agreed a £1.2 billion settlement in the US over accusations it had allowed drug cartels and rogue states to launder money . While there are no suggestions of . wrongdoing, Murray Worthy, from tax avoidance campaigners UK Uncut, . said: ‘I think it is absolutely no surprise for someone who spent so . many years cosying up to big business that he has now found himself a . very lucrative job at a firm that has itself been embroiled with many . cases of tax avoidance.’ MPs on the influential public . administration committee repeatedly accused Mr Hartnett of lying over a . £10million settlement with Goldman Sachs as well as being ‘cavalier’ with taxpayers’ money. Described as Britain’s most ‘wined . and dined’ civil servant, Mr Hartnett also sparked controversy over a . total of 107 meals he enjoyed with corporate giants over a three-year . period. Spoof: A protest group entered a dinner at which Mr Hartnett was speaking last year and attempted to present him a spoof award, called the Golden Handshake . The protest group The Intruders presented the award at New College, Oxford . One of these included a ‘sandwich lunch’ with executives at HSBC which took place in February 2010. But the Prime Minister was told that the contacts Mr Hartnett had with . HSBC ‘were no more significant than the contacts he had with other banks . operating in the UK’. Pay consultants who advise banks on their salary packages make prostitutes look ‘respectable’,  a former Chancellor of the Exchequer said yesterday. Tory peer Lord Lawson gave his forthright opinion as MPs took evidence on standards in the banking industry. He said: ‘In my experience, they [pay consultants] are a profession which makes prostitution seem thoroughly respectable.’ And Lord Lawson refused to back down even when a witness giving evidence to him took exception to the characterisation. Carol Arrowsmith, a pay consultant with Deloitte, said it was ‘difficult’ to accept the suggestion her profession was worse than prostitution. Lord Lawson replied: ‘It may be difficult but it may be true.’ Mr Hartnett is one of five . independent advisers hired by the bank to enforce what it says will be . ‘the highest standards, in particular in relation to combating financial . crime’. HSBC said the committee on which he will serve will have a remit to cover group standards ‘regarding tax transparency’. A spokesman for the bank said this was more about checking the tax affairs of prospective clients, rather than the bank itself. HSBC refused to disclose how much it . will pay Mr Hartnett, who earned a salary of between £160,000 and . £165,000 before he left HMRC. HSBC has been forced to beef up its . team combating financial crime after being fined £1.2billion for ‘turning a blind eye’ to large-scale money laundering by drug cartels, . terrorists and rogue regimes. The bank was attacked by American authorities for ‘stunning failures’ last month. The US Department of Justice accused . HSBC of an ‘astonishing record of dysfunction’ in allowing hundreds of . millions of illicit dollars through its branches. In other damning details, it emerged . that Mexican drug gangs used the bank so often they built special boxes . to fit into the HSBC tellers’ slots. Washington said at least £550million . in proceeds from drug trafficking from Mexican and drug cartels was . laundered through HSBC in the US. It also accused the bank of helping . countries evade sanctions with £410million from Sudan, Libya and others . sent to HSBC accounts in the US. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver . said: ‘The new committee, which will benefit from the experience of the . expert advisers, will provide invaluable guidance and advice as we . strengthen our capabilities and enforce the highest standards.’ At a corporate tax planning conference last year, where Mr Hartnett was giving a speech, eight protesters presented the former HMRC boss with a spoof award. They presented an award for a 'lifetime's service to corporate tax planning' - called the Golden Handshake - to Mr Hartnett at the lavish dinner at New College, Oxford. The other guests at the dinner were delighted, giving the news a round of applause. But it slowly dawned on Mr Hartnett that the prize was a stunt. The group, known as WeAreTheIntruders, launched into a rendition of 'Oh for he's a jolly good fellow... and so say Goldman Sachs' as they were escorted out. About 1.5million people have not . filed their self-assessment tax return with just hours to go before . tonight’s deadline, HMRC said. By last night, about 10.6million . Britons, including millions of self-employed workers, should have filed . their return for the 2011/12 tax year, or face a £100 penalty. But HMRC said it had received only 9.1million tax returns. The fines will escalate dramatically. After three months, they will be charged £10 for each following day. After six months, they are also charged £300 or 5 per cent of the tax . that is owed, whichever is higher.","Dave Hartnett, former head of HMRC, will work for the bank as an adviser .

"Pregnant women could be given the anti-impotence drug Viagra to boost the growth of underweight babies. A trial is underway to see if the little blue pill can boost survival in babies that are not growing properly in the womb. More than 120 women carrying extremely low-growth babies will be given regular doses of sildenafil citrate, a generic version of Viagra, during their pregnancy. A previous study found that the sex drug Viagra boosted blood flow to the placenta, which in turn promoted baby growth . The results will then be compared with those from a similar group of women given an identical looking dummy tablet. The trial has been set up after laboratory studies suggested Viagra, which was launched in the UK in 1998 as the world's first pill for erectile dysfunction, could help babies thrive in the womb by boosting the blood supply to the placenta. Around 600 babies a year in the UK are stillborn because of a pregnancy disorder called pre-eclampsia. The arteries feeding the placenta do not widen enough to deliver all the blood the baby needs. But during tests foetal deaths dropped sharply in pregnant mice given Viagra. The drug helps by relaxing muscles in the artery walls and allowing more nutrient-rich blood to pump through. Now scientists in New Zealand and Australia are recruiting pregnant women for the first human trial of Viagra for foetal growth. Around 600 babies a year in the UK are stillborn because of a pregnancy disorder called pre-eclampsia. The arteries feeding the placenta do not widen enough to deliver all the blood the baby needs . There is currently no treatment for growth restriction, other than early delivery once a baby is in danger,' said Dr Kate Groom, who is leading the research at the University of Auckland. 'If we can enhance foetal growth and delay delivery, we will improve babies' survival rates and reduce the many complications that can lead to life-long disability or disease.' Similar trials are planned for the UK in the next few years. Although Viagra was launched to help men's flagging sex lives, it has since found several other uses. The drug has been used to save the lives of both babies and adults suffering from a condition called pulmonary arterial hypertension, which affects around 4,000 people in the UK. Blood pressure becomes dangerously high in the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the right side of the heart to the small arteries in the lungs. But a Viagra-based drug, called Revatio, is extending the lives of some sufferers by boosting blood flow to the lungs, reducing the workload on the heart. The drug has also shown potential as a treatment for everything from breast cancer and diabetes to cold hands and heart attacks. Findings from the initial trials in New Zealand and Australia are expected to emerge by early 2017.","Study is underway to see if sex drug can boost survival of babies who are not growing the womb .

"The belief that a good night's sleep boosts memory has been shown in countless tests. But up until now, direct evidence has been lacking on how exactly sleep strengthens the brains' neural connections. Now researchers in New York have, for the first time, provided clear physical evidence that sleep fortifies learning. A new study has revealed that sleep after learning strengthens connections between brain cells and enhances memory. The finding adds to evidence that a lack of shut-eye causes rogue proteins to build up in the eye increasing the risk for Alzheimer's disease . The finding adds to research that a lack of shut eye causes rogue proteins to build up in the eye, increasing the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Using a microscope, scientists looked inside the brains of mice to see what happened when they were either asleep, or sleep-deprived, after being trained to walk on top of a rotating rod for the first time. They found learning led to the formation of new dendritic spines - tiny structures that project from the end of nerve cells and help pass electric signals from one neuron to another - but only in the mice left to sleep. The study, published in Science, provides the first physical evidence of how sleep helps to consolidate and strengthen new memories. Brain cells that spark as we digest new information during waking hours, replay during deep sleep. The study reveals hows learning and sleep cause changes in the motor cortex area of the brain (shown in orange) - a region responsible for voluntary movements . It revealed learning and sleep cause changes in the motor cortex area of the brain, a region responsible for voluntary movements. Professor Wen-Biao Gan, of New York University, said: 'We have known for a long time sleep plays an important role in learning and memory. If you do not sleep well you will not learn well. 'Here we have shown how sleep helps neurons form very specific connections on dendritic branches that may facilitate long-term memory. 'We also show how different types of learning form synapses on different branches of the same neurons, suggesting that learning causes very specific structural changes in the brain.' On the cellular level, sleep is anything but restful. Brain cells that spark as we digest new information during waking hours replay during deep sleep, also known as slow wave sleep. This is when brain waves slow down and rapid-eye movement, as well as dreaming, stops. Scientists found learning led to the formation of new dendritic spines - tiny structures that project from the end of nerve cells and help pass electric signals from one neuron to another. These structures are crucial for improving memory . Bosses should allow staff to take naps at work to boost productivity and creativity, a leading academic has suggested. Vincent Walsh, professor of human brain research at University College London, also proposed they should be allowed to set their own work times, arriving whenever they want. We have become obsessed with sleeping only during the night and fail to appreciate the benefits of an afternoon siesta, he told Cheltenham Science Festival. ‘It’s best to give your brain downtime. I have a nap every afternoon,’ he said. ‘It’s only since the industrial revolution we have been obsessed with squeezing all our sleep into the night rather than having one or two sleeps through the day.’ The professor said a nap of between 30 and 90 minutes in the afternoon could help companies improve productivity. ‘If we want people to be more creative we need people to be able to do less,’ he said. ‘Companies should allow naps in the afternoon. They should get rid of the habit of clocking in and clocking out. ‘Let people come in when they want. If they want to work through the night, let them.’ Scientists have long believed this nocturnal replay helps us form and recall new memories, yet the structural changes underpinning this process have remained poorly understood. So Dr Gan and colleagues used mice genetically engineered to express a fluorescent protein in neurons to find out exactly what is going on. A laser scanning microscope illuminated the glowing fluorescent proteins in the motor cortex, allowing the scientists to track and image the growth of dendritic spines before and after the mice learned to balance on a spin rod. Dr Gan said: 'It is like learning to ride a bike. Once you learn it, you never forget.' The researchers trained one set of mice to sleep for seven hours and another to stay awake for the same period of time, after both groups practised for 60 minutes. The mice lacking in sleep experienced significantly less dendritic spine growth than the well rested ones. Furthermore, the type of task learned determined which dendritic branches spines would grow. Running forward on the spinning rod, for instance, produced spine growth on different dendritic branches than running backward on it, suggesting learning specific tasks causes specific structural changes in the brain. Dr Gan said: 'Now we know when we learn something new, a neuron will grow new connections on a specific branch. 'Imagine a tree that grows leaves on one branch but not another branch. When we learn something new, it is like we are sprouting leaves on a specific branch.' Finally, the scientists showed that brain cells in the motor cortex that activate when mice learn a task reactivate during slow-wave deep sleep. Disrupting this process, they found, prevents dendritic spine growth. Their findings offer an important insight into the functional role of neuronal replay, the process by which the sleeping brain rehearses tasks learned during the day observed in the motor cortex. Dr Gan: 'Our data suggest neuronal reactivation during sleep is quite important for growing specific connections within the motor cortex.'","Scientists studied the brains of mice to see what happened during sleep .

"A cruel couple have been banned from owning animals after they bought their children a pony - and kept it in a dark shed in the back garden of their small terraced home. Lisa and Wayne Badger stored the cute animal in the locked 6ft x 4ft shed in their rubbish-strewn garden with no natural light at their house in the middle of Dudley town centre, West Midlands. A court heard the couple purchased two-year-old Diddy as a present for their kids - but only fed him on bits of vegetables and potato peelings. When RSPCA inspectors found Diddy on February 20, 2011 following a tip-off, he was so emaciated that his backbone was visible. Forlorn: Diddy the pony in the back garden of a home in Dudley where it was kept in appalling conditions after being brought as a present for two children . Cramped: The shabby shed surrounded by junk where Diddy was kept at night time . Dudley Magistrates Court heard how the poorly pony was discovered dirty and lice-infested in the couple’s 15ft long garden surrounded by a quad bike and gas canisters. Inspectors originally cautioned Mr Badger, 28, and told him to visit a vet and move Diddy to a field. But when they returned two days later the pony was found in exactly the same state. The pony was seized and taken to a vet where it was treated for lice and malnourishment. On Wednesday, the couple pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and failing to take reasonable steps to ensure its needs were met. District Judge Graham Wilkinson banned the pair from owning animals for 10 years. Lice-infested Diddy wanders through the garden. Former owner Lisa Badger said they took on more than they could handle . Diddy was so malnourished when rescued by RSPCA inspectors that his backbone was visible. He had been fed on vegetables and water . He also gave the pair a 12 month supervision order and ordered them to pay £1,150 in vet and court costs. Judge Wilkinson said: 'Every young girl wants a pony, but everyone knows that they are expensive and that they have complex needs. 'But you put one into a back yard and took little care of it. 'Naively, you tried to provide the horse with food and water, but you were totally ill-equipped to deal with the animal.' The court heard the pony, which had been bought by the couple for their six-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter, had been living in the shed and had been fed on a diet of vegetables for at least four weeks. Nick Sutton, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: 'A inspector called round and was shown through the house to the garden where there was a garden area with rubbish and a shed. Cramped: Hay is strewn on the floor of the shed alongside scraps of vegetables and a bucket of water . Urban: The small terraced home in Dudley where parents Lisa and Wayne Badger live, and somehow thought it would be acceptable for a pony to live in the back garden . 'Inside the shed was the pony. It was emaciated with its back bone clearly visible. It was dirty and lice infested. 'The shed had no natural light, on the floor there was a bowl that had vegetables within it.' Lisa, 31, who is as a full time carer for her son, said yesterday (Fri) they did not realise how much care the pony would need. She said: 'We bought Diddy from a man we knew because we wanted to treat our little children. 'We didn’t realise he would be such a handful. But he did see daylight - it was only at night that we put him in the shed. 'I have learnt my lesson, we were trying to find Diddy alternative accommodation because we knew we had taken on too much. 'The kids miss him very much - but they know it is for the best.' RSPCA Inspector Paul Seddon said the pony had since been rehomed. He said: 'A small garden at a terraced house in the middle of Dudley full of hazardous paraphernalia is by no means a place for a complicated animal like a pony - they need a field. 'Diddy could hardly turn around in the shed and the conditions were completely unsuitable. 'He was living in darkness as the window was boarded up. 'It was a sad case but at least it has a happy ending as Diddy has now found a new place to live and is doing well.'","Lisa and Wayne Badger bought Diddy the pony for their two children .

"The blue light emitted by phones, tablets and energy efficient lightbulbs are known to disrupt sleep, but U.S. engineers claim to have developed a solution. Named Drift Light, the LED reduces the amount of blue light that is traditionally emitted from a modern bulb, and also fades to darkness gradually to mimic sunset and even moonlight. By changing light levels slowly, the company claims the $29 (£17) bulb promotes relaxation and increases levels of the sleep hormone melatonin. The Drift Light costs $29 (£17) and reduces the amount of blue light emitted compared to phone screens and other energy efficient bulbs. In Midnight and Moonlight mode, the light gradually fades over the course of 37 minutes, pictured, to mimic a sunset and help people get to sleep naturally . Research shows that almost six in ten people are not getting enough sleep - a 50 per cent increase on just a year ago. Experts blame the rise on growing numbers of us using smartphones, tablet computers and other gadgets in bed and in the hour or two before turning in. The blue light emitted by the screens reduces drowsiness and so makes it harder to fall asleep. Psychologist Professor Wiseman said: ‘The blue light from these devices suppresses the production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and so it’s important to avoid them before bedtime.’ According to the firm’s website: ‘Falling asleep is highly dependent on behaviour. ‘Our bodies don’t adjust well to abrupt changes. Having an easy transition from waking to sleeping helps prepare you for sleep.’ The Drift Light was designed to fade over 37 minutes, which is the average duration of a sunset. It comes with three modes, all controlled via a light switch on the wall. In Daylight mode, the switch is used in the same way as a standard light.

"It is not an airline often associated with comfort. So it will perhaps surprise some travellers to learn that Ryanair can actually lay claim to providing its passengers with more legroom than most of its rivals. The budget airline's smallest seats were behind only British Airways and Aer Lingus in offering the most room among Britain’s airlines. Scroll down for video . Ryanair has signed a £13bn deal to buy up to 200 new Boeing 737 Max 200 planes, which will include slimmer seats and reduced galley space to fit in eight additional seats . The Irish carrier boasts between 30 and 34ins of leg space in its economy-class seats compared to easyJet with 29ins, Thomas Cook with between 28 and 30ins and Monarch with 28-34ins. Thomson flights offer between 28-34ins while Aer Lingus provided 31-32ins and British Airways between 31 and 34ins, according to review site SeatGuru.com. The airline, which has been much maligned by passengers over the years for its poor customer service, has seat widths of 17ins on its Boeing 737-800 jets - only narrowly smaller than British Airways who offer up to 18ins in its economy class cabins. easyJet gives passengers 29ins of legroom on its fleet of Airbus A319 and A320 planes . The width of easyJet's seats are 18ins, slightly wider than Ryanair and the same as British Airways . Monarch was revealed to have the smallest seat widths at 16.25-17.5ins. The figures are revealed at a time when seat space on flights has become a controversial issue after a spate of air rage incidents were reported on US flights in recent weeks. Legroom (inches)   Seat width . British Airways         31-34                   18 . Aer Lingus                31-32                   17 .

Monarch                   28-34            16.25-17.5 . Thomas Cook           28-30                   17 . Rows between passengers over legroom forced three pilots to divert planes, while the International Air Transport Association said its members reported a 'clear, general upward trend in instances of unruly and disruptive behaviour on board aircraft' around the world last year. On Monday, Ryanair signed a £13billion deal to buy up to 200 new Boeing 737 Max 200 planes, a new design which includes slimmer seats and reduced galley space which will be able to squeeze additional seats into the American plane maker's popular single-aisle aircraft. They will feature a total of 197 seats – eight more than the 189 seats possible in the 737-800 planes currently being used. The airline also said the new configuration would provide passengers with even more legroom than the average of 30ins on its current fleet, although it did not reveal exactly how much more legroom would be available. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said the extra seats would generate almost £1m of additional revenue per plane per year. British Airways offers its passengers between 31in and 34in of legroom in its economy class cabins . Ryanair's deal to buy the new planes, which are set to arrive in 2019, are part of O'Leary’s plan to expand their flights to accommodate 150million passengers each year by 2024. The company has grown from a single Ireland-England service in 1985 to the biggest short-haul airline in Europe today, currently carrying more than 80 million customers annually. While customers say they like the Ryanair's cheap ticket prices and huge selection of destinations across Europe, they have frequently vented their frustration over poor customer service. It was last year that consumer magazine Which? published a survey of more than 3,300 readers that placed Ryanair last among 100 top brands in quality of customer service.","Budget airline provides 30-34ins of legroom compared to easyJet's 29ins .

"Legend: Wildlife broadcaster Terry Nutkins died yesterday after a nine-month battle with cancer . Television legend Terry Nutkins has died after a battle with leukaemia. The father of eight, 66, became a household name after presenting BBC shows The Really Wild Show and Animal Magic. He died on Thursday and his passion for the animal kingdom and nature was an inspiration to millions of children. Well known for his ebullient personality and unruly long hair,  he also lost the tops of two fingers after they were chewed off by an otter called Edal when he was 15. His big break came when he joined Johnny Morris on BBC favourite Animal Magic. He then took on a role on the The Really Wild Show in 1986 and enjoyed seven years of great success alongside Chris Packham, Nicola Davies and Sue Dawson. Mr Nutkins also appeared on Growing Up Wild and Pets Win Prizes. Speaking about how his passion for animals was born, Nutkins would bunk off school and then climb over the fence of London Zoo. The keepers took him under their wing and allowed him to muck out the elephant enclosure. 'It all came about after one day I decided I didn't want to go to . school, so instead I crossed Regent's Park, climbed over the fence of . the zoo and ended up near the elephant enclosure. That's when my love of . animals was completely confirmed,' he said. 'The keepers liked . my enthusiasm and cheek, and so I learned all I could from them, about . some of the most dangerous animals in the world. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Terry, pictured with his wife Jackie, who lived together with their family in rural Scotland . Happy family: Nutkins surrounded by the people he loved, including six of his eight children, his wife and dogs . 'I had . this instinctive bond with these animals. I used . to go home at night and when I went to bed, I didn't wash my hands . because I liked to smell the elephants on them,' he told the Guardian. His agent John Miles said Mr Nutkins died at home in Scotland. 'He had fought for about nine months or so with acute leukaemia, he said. The Londoner, who is survived by his wife, eight children and eight grandchildren, made his home in Glenelg on the west coast of Scotland, near the Isle of Skye. Mr Miles said: 'He was an absolutely . lovely guy and just loved animals, and he was never happier than when he . was with animals. We will all miss him very, very much.' Likeness: Terry with a bust made for him in 2010 at the Royal Horticultural Society Show in Cheshire . Loved: Celebrities have rushed to pay tribute the the wildlife expert who inspired millions of children . Fellow television presenters paid tribute to Mr Nutkins last night. Philip Schofield described him as a 'delightful man and a passionate naturalist', while Ben Fogle said the animal lover was one of his 'childhood inspirations'. Nutkins grew up near Marylebone . station and bunked off school to help out at London Zoo, where his . expertise with animals became obvious. He was sent to Scotland at the age of 11 to work with Ring Of Bright Water author Gavin Maxwell and help care for wild otters. Maxwell eventually became his legal guardian and Nutkins made the west coast of Scotland his home. Animal lover: Terry had an affinity with wildlife that children loved - pictured here with a baby seal . @TVsSimonKing: . So sad to Learn that Terry Nutkins has passed away. Sincere condolences . to all his loved ones. He was a true enthusiast and fine naturalist . @SonaliShah: RIP Terry Nutkins.

"Obese people are at greater risk of developing a serious lung disease, scientists have today warned. Researchers found excessive fat around the waist and low levels of physical activity are linked to the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A team of experts in Germany and the U.S. looked at the relationship between waist and hip circumference, body mass index (BMI) and exercise levels to COPD cases. They assessed the link in more than 113,000 men and women in the U.S. aged between 50 and 70, who did not have COPD, cancer or heart disease  at the beginning of the study in 1995. A new study conducted by scientists in Germany and the U.S. has found the larger a person's waistline, the more likely they are to develop a serious lung disease . During the 10-year study, COPD developed in 3,648 of those taking part. People with larger waists - measuring 110cm or 43.3ins or more in women and 118cm or 46.4ins or more in men - had a 72 per cent increased risk of COPD. Study co-author Dr Gundula Behrens of Regensburg University in Germany, said: 'We observed a stronger positive relation with abdominal body fat than with total body fat and COPD. 'In particular, overweight as measured by BMI emerged as a significant predictor of increased risk of COPD only among those with a large waist circumference.' Dr Behrens said a large waist was a robust predictor of COPD in smokers as well as in people who had never smoked. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for the collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease. Pictured is an X-ray of someone suffering the disease . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for the collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease. People with COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways. Typical symptoms of COPD include increasing breathlessness when a person is active, a persistent cough with phlegm and frequent chest infections. The main cause of COPD is smoking, the longer you smoke the more likely you are to develop the disease. This is because smoking irritates the lungs, which results in scarring. Over many years the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung, thickening the airways, producing more mucus. COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually affects people over the age of 35, although most cases are not diagnosed until a person is in their 50s. There are thought to be three million people living with the disease in the UK. Source: NHS Choices . Pollution, smoking and toxic . particles in workplace dust are thought to cause COPD through chronic . inflammation and impaired ability to heal injury to the lungs. Dr . Behrens said: 'Increased local, abdominal and overall fat depots . increase local and systemic inflammation, thus potentially stimulating . COPD-related processes in the lung.' People . with a large hip circumference and who were physically active at least . five times a week were 29 per cent less likely to experience COPD. Exercise can reduce inflammation, oxidative stress and enhance healing. The findings, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, also showed that underweight people had a 56 per cent increased risk of COPD. Dr Behrens said possible reasons include malnutrition and reduced muscle mass leading to increased COPD susceptibility and progression through inflammatory processes and impaired lung repair capacity. Dr Behrens added: 'Our findings suggest that next to smoking cessation and the prevention of smoking initiation, meeting guidelines for body weight, body shape and physical activity level may represent important individual and public health opportunities to decrease the risk of COPD. 'Physicians should encourage their patients to adhere to these guidelines as a means of preventing chronic diseases in general and possibly COPD in particular.'","Team of scientists in Germany studied more than 113,000 men and women aged 50 to 70 over a period of 10 years .

"It's one of the most iconic bridges in the world - and apparently the most lethal. Operators of San Francisco's famous Golden Gate Bridge have been busy trying to implement new safety measures to prevent suicides after 2013 was reportedly its deadliest year. According to The Telegraph, 46 people were known to have jumped to their deaths from the 425-foot high structure last year. Suicides on the bridge are not officially recorded, so the number could be higher. If 46 is the figure, however, it means that over 1,500 people have killed themselves at the site since the bridge opened in 1937. Deadly: A reported 46 people died by jumping off San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge last year, prompting authorities to finally implement more effective safety measures . A proposed $66 million project has been put forward to raise the railings and install sweeping nets under the public walkway and cycle path. There has been disagreement lengthening the railings for decades, principally because it would inhibit the view. Now that the main focus is on a 20-foot wide, plastic-covered steel net under the walkway, authorities are close to providing funding. The bridge is the second most popular suicide spot in the world. Of those who jump, 98 percent do not survive the impact. The drop takes four seconds and the jumper hits the water at 75 mph. Only five percent survive that impact, then drown or die of cold in the treacherous waters. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China, which has seen more than 2,000 people kill themselves by jumping since it opened in 1968, is the world's most notorious suicide bridge. Number one: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge - across the Yangtze River between Pukou and Xiaguan in Nanjing, China - is the world's most common suicide site. It is 40 meters high . Britain's infamous Beachy Head cliff in East Sussex is the scene of around 20 suicides a year. Suicides occur occasionally at the Empire State Building in New York - which has fences well above head height on the outdoor observation deck - as well as from other skyscrapers. The Grand Canyon is often also the scene of suicides. However the Golden Gate is by far America's top site. The steel bridge is famous for its distinctive orange-vermillion hue, with the tops of its towers often the only portion visible above San Francisco’s notorious, billowing sea fog. The Beachy Head headland in Britain's East Sussex is the world's second most common suicide spot . But from the beginning it has drawn the despondent from near and far. California Highway Patrol police officers swoop whenever anyone is spotted over the railing. Kevin Briggs, one of the officers, has talked hundreds of people out of leaping – or grabbed them as they wavered, once spending seven hours persuading a depressed father not to throw himself off. 'But I remember one man who, after I talked to him for 40 to 60 minutes, just said ''Kevin, I have to go now'' and he jumped,' he said.

"A burka ban will be brought in by the government of Spain’s Catalonia region in the wake of a European Court of Human Rights ruling that banning veils does not breach human rights laws. Ramon Espadaler, Interior Minister for Catalonia, said that the ban, first proposed in 2013, was in no way an attack on religious freedom as the wearing of helmets and masks in public will also be forbidden. Espadaler announced that the Catalan government aimed to get the ban approved after the summer 2014 recess, The Local reported. Reasoning: Ramon Espadaler, Interior Minister for Catalonia, said that the burka ban, first proposed in 2013, was in no way an attack on religious freedom . The European Court of Human Rights based its ruling on a test case from France. It was brought by a French woman in her mid-20s who is a devout Muslim no longer allowed to wear in public the burka, which covers the whole body, or the full-face niqab veil, because a new French law prohibits concealment of the face in public places. She complained that the new law, which came into force in April 2011, infringed the European Convention on Human Rights because it amounted to discrimination on grounds of sex, religion and ethnic origin. But the European Court ruled that promoting respect for the conditions in which people 'live together' in public places was a legitimate aim justifying the ban and did not breach the convention. Following the ruling, Austria, Norway and Denmark may also ban the burka. Members of Austria's Freedom Party said that there was no compulsion in Islam to wear a full-face veil, and so any ban would not constitute an attack on religious freedoms. Freedom Party spokeswoman Carmen Gartelgruber told The Local that in the 'wide, conservative circles of Islamic immigration society', the opinion prevails that women are second-class citizens. One of the many instruments for oppressing women is the burka, she added. Conclusion: The European Court of Human Rights (pictured) based its ruling that a burka ban does not breach human rights on a test case from France . In Denmark a ban was last discussed between 2009 and 2010 but was quickly shot down in the belief that the European Court would rule against it. But now Martin Henriksen, a member of the anti-immigration People's Party, says the legal framework for a ban has been laid down. He told Politiken: '[A ban] would send the signal that we do not accept parallel societies and isolation. We see [the burka] as a rejection of Danish society. 'It is a sign that one wishes to distance themselves from the rest of society.' Meanwhile the Labour and Progress parties in Norway welcomed the ban, and suggested they may also raise the issue again. Former Labour Party leader Thorbjørn Jagland said the judgement was positive, and recognised that hiding behind a veil meant other members of your community struggled to relate to you. Tory MP Philip Hollobone, meanwhile, urged the Government to press on with banning the veil in Britain. He said: 'Finally, at long last, we have had a sensible decision from the European Court of Human Rights about something. 'We will never have a fully functioning, fully integrated multi-cultural society if growing numbers of our citizens go around with their faces covered.'","Catalonia Interior Minister said ban was not an attack on religious freedom .

"Apple has strenuously denied it played any role in the National Security Agency's alleged efforts to hack the iPhone, after it emerged that the spy agency had developed a system to hack into and monitor the devices. Documents released on Monday and published in Germany's Der Spiegel reveal that the NSA actively worked on software that enabled it to remotely access iPhones and their text messages, photographs, contacts, location, voice mail and even their video. The report included an NSA graphic dated 2008 that outlined a system in development called DROPOUTJEEP, described as a 'software implant' that allows infiltrators to push and pull and retrieve data from iPhones such as contact lists. Der Spiegel referred to it as a 'trojan,' or malware that helps hackers get into protected systems. Denials: Apple Inc. and their CEO Tim Cook have strenuously denied any collusion with the NSA in a backdoor spying program aimed at users of iPhones . It is not clear where Der Spiegel acquired this information - however the magazine has worked with whistleblower Edward Snowden in the past. The report, which surfaced on Sunday, did not suggest that Apple had cooperated with the U.S. spying agency on so-called backdoors. The Cupertino, California-based, company said Tuesday it had never worked with the NSA to deliberately weaken its products, promising that it would 'defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who's behind them.' In a statement issued Tuesday, the NSA did not comment on any specific allegations but said that its interest 'in any given technology is driven by the use of that technology by foreign intelligence targets.' 'The United States pursues its intelligence mission with care to ensure that innocent users of those same technologies are not affected,' the agency added. The iPhone was a relatively innovative gadget in 2008. It hit the market in 2007 and proceeded to help revolutionize the mobile phone industry. 'Apple has never worked with the NSA to create a backdoor in any of our products, including iPhone. Additionally, we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products,' the company said in a statement. 'We will continue to use our resources to stay ahead of malicious hackers and defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who's behind them.' A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device (stock image pictured) that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection . The controversial report could not have come at a worse time for Apple, which announced a deal earlier this month to sell iPhones on China Mobile's network, thereby allowing the tech-giant to enter a market that has 700 million customers. Obviously, any suggestion that Apple could be vulnerable to U.S. government surveillance snooping could damage any such deal. According to Der Spiegel, the NSA's trojan program allows the intelligence agency to read text messages and listen to voicemails and had a 100 percent success rate on iOS devices. And on Monday, journalist and security expert Jacob Appelbaum revealed how exactly the NSA can turn your iPhone into an eavesdropping tool. Appelbaum used his slot at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference for hackers, to pull back the curtain on the National Security Agency's arsenal of high-tech spy gear including how it can use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computers, even if they aren't online. He told hundreds of computer experts at the conference that the NSA's capabilities ‘are even worse than your worst nightmares.’ ‘What I am going to show you today is wrist-slittingly depressing,’ he said. The investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA (headquarters pictured) spying on Apple products, which suggested a 'backdoor' in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. Apple said at the time that it had never worked with the NSA to deliberately weaken its products . Even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the NSA and its methods, Appelbaum's claims - supported by what appeared to be internal NSA slideshows - still caused a stir. One of the slides described how the NSA can plant malicious software onto Apple's iPhone, giving American intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket-sized spy. ‘Apple has never worked with the NSA to create a backdoor in any of our products, including iPhone,’ the company said in a statement to AllThingsD. ‘Additionally, we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products.’ Another slide showcased a futuristic-sounding device described as a ‘portable continuous wave generator,’ a remote-controlled device which - when paired with tiny electronic implants - can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed, even if the target device isn't connected to the internet. A third slide showcased a piece of equipment called NIGHTSTAND, which can tamper with wireless internet connections from up to eight miles (13 kilometers) away. An NSA spokeswoman, Vanee Vines, said that she wasn't aware of Appelbaum's presentation, but that in general should would not comment on ‘alleged foreign intelligence activities.’ Appelbaum told hundreds of computer experts gathered at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference that his revelations about the NSA's capabilities 'are even worse than your worst nightmares' ‘As we've said before, NSA's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets - not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the U.S. government.’ The documents included in Appelbaum's presentation were first published by German magazine Der Spiegel on Sunday and revealed details about the undercover work carried out for the NSA by an elite team of hackers known as Tailored Access Operations (TAO). TAO's mission is ‘Getting the ungettable,’ and an unnamed intelligence official had said that TAO had gathered ‘some of the most significant intelligence our country has ever seen.’ When agents with the TAO division want to infiltrate a network or a computer, they turn to their technical experts known as Advanced Network Technology (ANT), which produces tools for penetrating network equipment and monitoring mobile phones and computers. ANT's products have helped TAO agents infiltrate networks and divert or even modify data wherever the NSA's usual methods aren't enough. TAO has a catalog of high-tech gadgets for hard-to-crack cases, including computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed across the screen, USB sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves, and fake base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go. GSM base stations, for example, make it possible to monitor mobile phones, such as that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel . In the catalog a rigged monitor cable, which allows ‘TAO personnel to see what is displayed on the targeted monitor,’ goes for $30. An ‘active GSM base station’ that makes it possible to mimic the cell phone tower of a target network and thus monitor mobile phones, is available for $40,000. Computer bugging devices disguised as normal USB plugs, capable of sending and receiving data undetected via radio link, are available in packs of 50, for over $1 million. These tools haven't just been used exclusively to track suspected terrorists. GSM base stations, for example, make it possible to monitor mobile phones, such as that belonging to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Radar systems such as the one known as DROPMIRE have also been used to spy on allies, for example EU representatives in Washington. And the hardware 'implants' found in the ANT catalog evidently have been used to tap encrypted faxes. Protestors hold up placards featuring a picture of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and with the world Asylum on it during a march against the spying methods of the US in Hamburg, northern Germany on Sunday . The catalog isn't up to date and many of the software solutions on offer date from 2008. As a result some apply to server systems or mobile phone models that are no longer on the market. A Trojan for gaining total access to iPhones, which was still new at that time, was still in development, though its specifications were still listed in the catalog. One internal NSA document dating from 2004 describes a spyware program called VALIDATOR that it provides 'unique backdoor access to personal computers of targets of national interest, including but not limited to terrorist targets.'

"Dr Ali Mao-Aweys faces being struck off after he told an undercover reporter that he could arrange for female circumcision to be carried out on two girls aged 10 and 13 . A doctor faces being struck off after he told an undercover reporter that he could arrange for female circumcision to be carried out on two girls aged 10 and 13. Dr Ali Mao-Aweys was caught on camera discussing female genital mutilation (FGM) with a female investigator, who posed as an aunt asking about the procedure for her nieces. The practice, which in its most extreme form can . involve the almost complete sewing up of a girl's vagina, has been . illegal in the UK since 1985. Dr Mao-Aweys denied offering to assist in arranging female genital mutilation, and was released without charge by police following an investigation. However, a fitness to practise panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester today ruled that he had offered to help the undercover reporter, and will now consider whether he should be allowed to continue to work as a doctor. Dr Mao-Aweys, who has private clinics in Birmingham and . Haringey, north London, was targeted in an undercover Sunday Times . sting masterminded by 'Fake Sheikh' Mahzer Mahmood in April 2012. The Somalian national was filmed discussing the barbaric procedure on a camera hidden in the handbag of an unknown female investigator. Posing as a patient 'Ms A', the reporter told the GP she wanted her two fictional nieces, aged 10 and 13, circumcised during a visit from Ghana. The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 made it an offence to carry out the procedure on a British female anywhere in the world. Mao-Aweys was arrested along with Birmingham dentist Omar Addow in May 2012 following the publication of the story on the investigation in the Sunday Times. Both were released without charge, but Addow was struck off by the General Dental Council last year after he was found to have offered to perform circumcision on the girls. Mao-Aweys, who denied the charges, is now facing the same fate after the fitness to practise panel ruled against him today. 'The panel decided that the recordings indicate that Dr Mao-Aweys initially considered doing the operations himself,' said chairman Dr Anthony Morgan. 'Even if Dr Mao-Aweys did not understand the English word 'nieces' he quickly established the ages and genders of the children to whom Ms A was referring. 'He then described an FGM procedure by drawing a diagram, which he referred to as a pharaonic cut [the most extreme form of FGM].' Dr Morgan added: 'It is clear that Dr Mao-Aweys knew that all FGM operations are illegal in the United Kingdom by the references he made to this fact in the consultation and by the comments of it being 'dangerous' with the possibility of going to jail. 'At no point in the consultation did he raise the issue of safeguarding children or any objections on his part to FGM. 'He did not seek to dissuade Ms A from continuing with her plans and only suggested that it would be safer (in the sense of not being illegal) for her to go abroad to have the operation carried out.' The panel saw video footage from two consultations at Mao-Aweys' Birmingham clinic as well as the transcript from a phone call made by the journalist. Target: Dr Mao-Aweys, who has private clinics in Birmingham and Haringey, north London, was targeted in an undercover sting in April 2012 . Sometimes called female circumcision, female genitial mutilation (FGM) refers to procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice, described by charity Orchid Project as an 'abuse of human, women’s and child rights', is illegal in the UK. However, it has been estimated that more than 20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk in Britain every year, and that 66,000 women in the UK are living with the consequences of FGM. The true figure is unknown due to the 'hidden' nature of the crime. FGM is usually carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15, most commonly before puberty starts, and many are taken overseas to undergo the procedure. It is illegal to arrange for a child to . be taken abroad for FGM. If caught, offenders face a large fine and a . prison sentence of up to 14 years. Often FGM is carried out by women with no medical training using knives, scissors, or even pieces of glass, while anaesthetics and antiseptic treatments are not generally used. There are four main types of FGM: Clitoridectomy, where all or part of the clitoris is removed, excision, where all or part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia are removed,  infibulation, which is the narrowing of the vaginal opening, and other harmful procedures such as pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping and burning the area. There are no health benefits to FGM. Removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies, causing pain, bleeding, risk of infection and even death. FGM is carried out for cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities, and is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl properly, and as a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage. FGM is often motivated by the belief that it is beneficial for the girl or woman. Many communities believe it will reduce a woman's libido and discourage sexual activity before marriage. Source: NHS . When asked about the procedure, sometimes referred to as 'cutting', he can be heard to say: 'Ah yes. I can help you.' At one point he also said: 'A Girl. Yes I do girl.' During . their meetings Mao-Aweys offered to assist the investigator in her . efforts to have two girls circumcised and said he knew a doctor in . Birmingham who could help. He told her it was a very short procedure, lasting less than ten minutes, as well as explaining the potential psychological problems and risks if the girls talked to friends or teachers. At times the doctor seems reluctant to discuss performing the operation and warns the reporter of the legal ramifications if caught. He said: 'In Gambia, Somalia - my country - it's no problem, but here they talk too much,' adding: 'I think it's best you go to Africa.' Between 12 April 2012 and 19 April . 2012 in meetings and during a telephone conversation with a reporter . working for the Sunday Times you: . a. Offered to assist in arranging an operation within the UK to effect the . genital mutilation of a female child or children knowing that such an . operation was illegal in the United Kingdom; PROVED . b. Provided information relating to a person whom you knew or believed . could arrange or undertake such an operation which you knew to be . illegal in the United Kingdom; PROVED . c. Gave advice to the journalist as to the arrangement of such an . operation outside the United Kingdom in order to assist her or another . to avoid UK legislation banning such a practice within the UK; PROVED . d. Offered to provide medication to facilitate such an operation outside . the United Kingdom in order to assist her or another to avoid UK . legislation banning such a practice within the United Kingdom. PROVED . When Mazher Mahmood phoned Mao-Aweys on April 21 to put the allegations to the doctor he denied offering to assist in FGM. He continued to deny the claims in interviews with police after he was arrested on 4 May 2012 and said he thought the reporter was referring to boys when she said nieces. During the hearing, Mao-Aweys, whose first language is German, claimed he had been 'entrapped' by the journalist and had thought he was discussing a legal FGM 'reversal' procedure or circumcision on boys. He failed to mount a full defence case when he walked out of the hearing after splitting with his legal team and losing a string of legal challenges to halt proceedings, claiming he had racked up around £250,000 in legal fees since the allegations emerged. The panel found his version of events was 'not credible or reliable' and that the recordings show he quickly established they were talking about females. 'Dr Mao-Aweys' own account of the tone of the consultation with Ms A appears to be at odds with what is seen and heard in the video footage,' said Dr Morgan. The panel will now decide if his fitness to practise is impaired due to misconduct before considering what sanction to impose. FGM is most common among some African, Asian and Middle Eastern communities and it is thought at least 66,000 girls and women in the UK are believed to be victims of FGM. The term FGM applies to a range of procedures that alter the female genitals for non-medical reasons, the most serious of which is the almost complete sewing up of the vagina. Although the practice has been banned in the UK since 1985 no successful prosecutions have been brought under British law, although two men face trial for FGM offences in January next year. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 31, is accused of carrying out the procedure on a woman after she gave birth at Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, on 24 November 2012. The alleged victim's husband, Hasan Mohamed, 40, will also face trial for allegedly encouraging FGM restoration. The hearing continues.","Dr Ali Mao-Aweys caught on camera discussing procedure with investigator .

According to The German Centre for Urology and Phalloplasty, which performs around 6,000 operations a year, penile enlargement surgery leaves the recipient with an extra three to six centimetres in length. Surgery can also give the patient an increased two to three centimetres in girth. Men can also choose to have their glans penis - otherwise known as the tip - made 30 to 50 per cent larger. But recipients don't need to worry that their secret will be discovered in the bedroom, as no visible scar being left by the deft surgeons' handiwork.

"A University football society has been accused of racism after more than 30 members 'blacked up' for an Africa Cup of Nations themed party. The male players from Stirling University FC were spotted wearing kilts, football kit and black face paint for a social in the Scottish town last night. An investigation has been launched after complaints were made about the 'boisterous' behaviour of the 'drunk' students as many were seen taking their tops off near popular bar The Crossed Peels.

'I happened to be in the flat across the road from Cape and I saw them leave around half 11, quarter to 12.' An anti-racism campaigner from Show Racism the Red Card said: 'The practice of blacking up was usually as part of a show by white entertainers for white audiences which relied on mocking black people's skin colour and culture.

"Juventus and Chile star Arturo Vidal insists he will only decide his future once he returns to Italy from his holidays. Vidal has been strongly linked with a move away from Turin this summer with Manchester United and Real Madrid among the top clubs keen to acquire the 27-year-old's services. 'It's difficult to speak of other teams when you are already at a top club,' Vidal said to Chilean newspaper La Cuarta. 'I have won the Serie A title three times and I respect my team-mates.

Hands off: Juventus are keen on keeping hold of star midfielder Arturo Vidal (left) 'I have heard about the interest shown by Real Madrid and (Manchester) United in me but there is someone (Vidal's agent) who deals with this.' Vidal moved to Juve from Bayer Leverkusen in 2011 and scored 11 goals in 32 league appearances to help the Turin giants win their third straight league title last season. Juve stated earlier this week that they have no intention of selling Vidal unless the midfielder expresses his wish to leave. Key target: Chile international Vidal had been on Louis van Gaal's summer wish-list . VIDEO United looking to add Vidal . Vidal, who has three years left on his contract with the Bianconeri, has not ruled out staying at Juve for the long term. 'Have I completed a cycle (at Juve)? I don't feel that way,' he said. 'Perhaps I will remain at Juventus all my life. 'Once I arrive to Italy I will speak to the coach and see what happens. New era: Manchester United are looking to the future under Louis van Gaal . 'Now the only thing on my mind on is that I have seven or eight days of holiday left and I want to go away from Chile in order to have a good rest.' The South American, who competed at the World Cup and helped his country reach the last 16 of the tournament, is expected to return to Turin for pre-season training on July 28.

"Pippa Middleton today made her 2012 debut in the Wimbledon royal box as she arrived to watch the day's action on Centre Court. Neat in a navy Orla Kiely dress and buttoned-up macrame jacket, the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister took her seat in the box with her brother James to watch Andy Murray battle for his place in the third round. Pippa, 28, a keen tennis fan, sat alongside Felicity Kendal and her son Jake Rudman, and the three soon struck up conversation. Chic: Pippa Middleton arrives with brother James to watch the action at Wimbledon from the royal box on Centre Court . Classic style: Pippa wore a chic navy Orla Kiely dress with an Orla Kiely macrame jacket buttoned over the top. She carried an Ermanno Scervino bag and wore Givenchy's Obsedia sunglasses, £159 . The Middletons, who attracted a flurry of attention as they entered the grounds earlier today, had clearly made an effort to put across a polished appearance in the hallowed royal box. Pippa is a member of the Queen's Tennis Club and a regular face at the tournament. Last year she attended with her ex-boyfriend, Alex Louden and her parents Michael and Carole, all of whom watched the action from the royal box. This year, Carole Middleton also attended - she watched Roger Federer take on Fabio Fognini on Centre Court yesterday. Unlike last year, Mrs Middleton did not sit in the royal box, where . Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined by Bruce Forsyth . and his wife Wilnelia. Instead, she joined the general public in the stands. Among the other guests in the royal box today was actress Felicity Kendal. New friends: Pippa sat alongside Felicity Kendal, left, and her son Jake Rudman . Getting along famously: Pippa and Jake seemed to be having a great time as they chatted courtside . Polished: Pippa and James made sure they were perfectly turned-out for their royal box appearance . Stylish: Pippa wore a summery ink and white jacket over her cotton dress . Like mother, like daughter: Carole also chose navy and white when she attended Wimbledon yesterday. Carole did not sit in the royal box, instead joining her friends in the stands . Pippa today wore a navy and white macrame jacket by Irish designer Orla Kiely, a designer she has chosen before - namely for her appearance at the Thames pageant, when she wore the same navy blue dress she wore today with another Orla Kiely jacket on top. Orla Kiely is a designer frequently chosen by the Duchess of Cambridge too, who wore a green Orla Kiely coat-dress on St Patrick's Day, and chose a brown dress for one of her public appearances during the Jubilee tour of Britain. Pippa's Orla Kiely macrame jacket, which was initially £265, is currently on sale for £132.50 . Pippa's sunglasses are Givenchy's Obsedia, available from Harvey Nichols at £159 . FASHION VERDICT BY NICOLE MOWBRAY, EDITOR OF LIFE & STYLE . Ascot wasn’t alone in launching a new dress code to keep out the scruffs this year. Wimbledon too has issued stricter rules about acceptable clothing in a bid to raise the sartorial standards of spectators. But it seems Pippa took the smart style dictat rather too literally on Centre Court today. Her buttoned-up formal look is not only way too old for her 28 years, but it’s also rather climate inappropriate - the temperature on Centre Court is expected to reach a whopping 28 degrees this afternoon; not really the weather for a knitted jacket. This new demure Pippa has been seen several times since the debacle in Paris where her friend pointed a gun at photographers. She wore the same rather frumpy Orla Kiely ensemble at the Jubilee river pageant earlier this month. Let’s not even talk about her sandals. This is the first public outing of the ‘Middleton wedge’ this summer, but don’t expect it to be the last. All the Middleton women wear the open-toed wedge style so often during the warm months they almost have to be surgically removed by the time autumn comes around.","Duchess of Cambridge's sister invited into royal box for second year running .

"Brendan Rodgers has predicted Liverpool will benefit from Harry Kane’s spectacular rise — as it will spur Daniel Sturridge on to cement himself as England’s No 1 striker. The biggest game in the Barclays Premier League this week takes place at Anfield tonight, with man-of- the-moment Kane and Tottenham’s rapidly improving side looking to derail Liverpool’s hopes of clambering back into the top four. Rodgers, a keen admirer of Kane, believes it is a question of when, rather than if, he gets a senior England call-up but he has given the 21-year-old an idea of how much further he has to climb by labelling Sturridge the best English forward in the business. Daniel Sturridge (centre) scored against West Ham on his return from a long injury lay-off . Harry Kane scored both of Tottenham's goals as they came from behind to beat Arsenal 2-1 on Saturday . Rodgers says the competition posed by Kane to Sturridge's England place will improve the Liverpool man . After Sturridge’s three appearances off the bench in a week, Rodgers is considering whether his striker is fit enough to start. The 25-year-old has had to watch as a number of players have staked their claim for inclusion in Roy Hodgson’s squad for next month’s games against Lithuania and Italy. However, Liverpool boss Rodgers does not feel any of those players have shown they are ready to match the standards Sturridge (right) has set in his career at Anfield. ‘I’m sure Daniel is happy there’s another English striker there,’ said Rodgers. ‘If Harry Kane’s going to be of the level to go on and play for England — which I believe he is — that helps Daniel and the other Liverpool players who play for England because it means you get another top-quality striker. But, for me, there is not anyone better than Daniel Sturridge. ‘He’s got everything in his game if he’s playing consistently. His goalscoring record, his pace, his power — he’s got everything and as an English striker there’s no-one better than him. ‘I’m sure Daniel will look at it that there’s another young English striker coming through and that will really help him when they come together at international level. When Daniel is on the field he gives the opponents’ defence a real problem but also he’s a natural goalscorer.’ Liverpool have carefully managed Sturridge’s rehabilitation and while the stakes against Tottenham are high, he will only start if Rodgers is satisfied he can stand the strain. ‘He has got a big, big talent,’ said Rodgers. ‘He’s going to have to try and work his way back to fitness in games as there’s so little time in between games to train.’ Kane (centre) heads Tottenham's winner four minutes from full-time against rivals Arsenal on Saturday . Midfielder Lucas Leiva (right) could be out for around a month after injuring his thigh against Everton . Liverpool owner John Henry (right) will be in attendance at Anfield for Liverpool's game with Tottenham . Rodgers’s preparations for the clash with Tottenham have been hindered by a thigh injury to key midfielder Lucas Leiva, which will keep him out for at least a month. It is a blow for the manager as Liverpool have been unbeaten in the last 11 Premier League games he has started. That run has helped them get into contention for a Champions League place but, equally, their poor start to the campaign means they have given themselves no margin for error. Rodgers insists he is under no pressure from Fenway Sports Group, the club’s owners. ‘We had a good chat after training,’ said Rodgers, referring to a visit to Melwood from John W Henry and Tom Werner. ‘They are on a flying visit for the game. I’ve never been set any targets but they know the type of manager they employed was a manager who wants to succeed. ‘For us, (the top four) is where we want to be and, after not such a good start to the season, we are picking up. We want to continue with the momentum and that’s all we can focus on.’","Harry Kane has 22 goals for Tottenham and is tipped to play for England .

"Guilty: Stephanie Knight, pictured outside court at an earlier hearing, was jailed for seven years after being found guilty of conspiracy to rape . A teenage girl who lured two young white girls on a night out to be raped by three Asian men was jailed for seven years yesterday. Stephanie Knight, then 17, told the 16-year-olds they were going for an 'exciting night' clubbing but instead plied them with vodka and drugs before forcing them to have sex with 'her boys'. The girls had been taken in a large 4x4 vehicle to a derelict house where they were subjected to a sickening sex attack by the three men, one of whom was on licence after being let out early from an eight-year prison sentence for robbery. Yesterday as the three attackers, Amjad Hussain, 34, Shahid Hussain, 37, and Tanveer Butt, 39, were jailed indefinitely at Preston Crown Court and ordered to serve at least seven-and-a-half years, a judge also sentenced Knight to seven years in a young offenders institute, saying she played a vital role. Judge Beverley Lunt said the teenager, who had been in care most of her life, had distorted views on morality and knew exactly what she was doing when she led them into the trap. She told Knight: 'You knew what has likely to happen when instructed by Amjad Hussain. 'You lured these two 16-year-girls from the safety of their homes and lured them into the clutches. 'You lied to them you said you were going on an exciting night out when there was no such intention.' She added: 'It is clear you have had a difficult life so there is no doubt you have distorted views on morality and appropriate behaviour. 'There is no question that you were badly used by these men. 'But this means that you knew what they were like and what their interests were yet your lured the girls into their clutches. 'But for you neither girl would have been exposed to the danger of that night and subjected to humiliating rapes. 'You played a vital part in this conspiracy and knew what you were doing.' Yesterday Knight, now 19, fought back tears as she stood in the dock alongside brothers Amjad and Shahid Hussain, and their cousin, father-of-four Butt. Addressing all four defendants Judge Lunt continued: 'It is a total lack of humanity shown by any of you as this girl was repeatedly raped which disturbing and horrifying in this case.' The case is the latest featuring Asian sex attackers preying on vulnerable young girls which has prompted former Home Secretary Jack Straw to warn that some Pakistani men in Britain see white teenagers as 'easy meat' for sexual abuse. Knight met the three attackers after one pulled up in the street beside her six months earlier in his car and asked for her number. Jailed indefinitely: From left, all pictured at a . previous court appearance, Tanveer Butt, Amjad Hussain and Shahid . Hussain were told they must serve at least seven-and-a-half years before . they are considered for parole . Soon she was regularly performing sex acts on them. Friends said the men would lavish her with attention, pay for her meals and take her for rides in their cars. One source said she was 'plasticine in their hands' and had been living on the streets and sofas for six months before the rapes. Knight befriended the two girls a week before the attack in her home town of Blackburn, Lancashire. After arranging to meet up with them in December 2009, she received a call thought to be from one of the gang during which she was heard to say 'got them'. The girls were made to down vodka and coke and smoke drugs, leaving one victim 'feeling smashed'. They were then taken to a derelict house with no electricity. Derelict: The run-down house in Accrington, Lancashire, without electricity where the two 16-year-olds were attacked by three Asian men . Knight ordered one girl to perform a sex act on one of the man, before holding her back as the other girl screamed as she was raped. As the screaming continued, Knight told the girl her friend would suffer even more if she did not comply, telling the victim that her friend was only 'chilling with my boys'. The men took turns to rape the second girl throughout the night after she was barricaded inside a room. Both girls were then raped again as Amjad Hussain drove them home. He also threatened them with a knife. The court heard that one of traumatised victims now felt invisible and often woke up crying. The girl said she suffered from anxiety attacks, was still frightened by a knock at the door and 'at the time hated Stephanie with every bone in her body.' Convicted: . Amjad Hussain, his brother Shahid and Tanveer Butt protested their . innocence but were found guilty of their parts in the girls' horrific . ordeal . But Elizabeth Nicholls, defending, said her client was as much of a victim. 'One does not have to look far for an explanation as to why this young lady has been drawn into the offences. At some stage she was much a victim as those that later become victim to her,' she said. Miss Nicholls gave a 'chilling account' of Knight's life in 23 different placements between the age of 11 and 17. She added: 'It is little wonder that she became a child deprived of love, affection and emotion support. 'She was a victim herself but did not regard herself as a victim but rather welcomed the attention of the men who preyed on her and these men.' In April 2009, Knight made a complaint to the police that she had been raped but no charges were brought and she continued on her 'destructive and chaotic lifestyle', Miss Nicholls said, adding: 'She was and still is vulnerable.' Squalid: The interior of the terraced house where a 16-year-old girl was subjected to a 'terrifying ordeal' after being lured there by Stephanie Knight . The court was told Amjad Hussain was on licence at the time of the attack after he was jailed for eight years for robbery in 2004. The father of one, whose partner was pregnant at the time of the attacks, had become hooked on alcohol and cannabis after his fabric shop closed due to be debts. Yesterday the three attackers were ordered to serve seven-and-a-half years for rape. Knight, of Rawtenstall, was jailed for seven years for conspiracy to rape and aiding and abetting. All defendants were told to sign the sex offenders' register. Following the hearing, Detective Sergeant Paul Langley, from Lancashire Police, said: 'These two girls thought they were going for a night out and instead were given alcohol and drugs and taken to a strange house where they were subjected to an horrific sexual ordeal at the hands of three much older men. 'What's worse is that this abuse was facilitated by someone the victims believed was their friend.' Several police forces are currently investigating gangs suspected of abusing young girls. A damning report which revealed one in four men accused of street grooming young girls for sex is Asian was commissioned after the ringleaders of a gang which struck in Derby were jailed earlier this year. Ashish Joshi, of Sikh Media Monitoring, said efforts to tackle the problem needed to focus on the Muslim community. 'It's a small element who treat white and Sikh girls as sexual playthings, and we aren't going to tackle it successfully unless the politically correct lobby stop putting up a smokescreen to hide the fact that this issue is about the Muslim community.'","Two girls, 16, told they were going to a nightclub but instead taken to a derelict house where they were attacked .

"Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has warned Christian Benteke he may again find himself warming the bench in Tuesday night's crunch six-pointer at Hull. Benteke, 24, was axed from Villa’s starting line for Saturday’s 2-1 defeat against Chelsea after scoring just two Premier League goals since returning from injury in October. Lambert instead selected Gabby Agbonlahor to lead the line against Jose Mourinho’s side and hinted he is likely to stick with the same attack against the Tigers as his team aim for a first league win in 10 attempts. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke started on the bench against Chelsea on Saturday . Paul Lambert has warned his player Benteke that he will leave him there again unless he improves his form .

That is football management. I expect to get a reaction from him.’ He added: 'It wasn't a hard decision. The decision to leave him out wasn't any harder than to leave anybody else out. 'That is football management. I expect to get a reaction from him. I think it would help him, it gives him that little bit of respite from it. 'Christian, by his own admission, knows himself he hasn't been playing well, but you need to protect him as well. He has only been in this country three years. 'The first year he was excellent, the second year he had a bad injury and he is just getting back to playing the game again. It is a normal reaction.' The Villa boss also revealed he and Mourinho didn’t speak after Saturday’s feisty clash. The pair have been involved in a series of spats and Mourinho appeared to stoke the fires further after the game when he suggested that if Villa ‘go down it is not because of the quality of their players’. ‘I know the way he meant it,’ Lambert added. ‘I will let Mr Mourinho have his view. We were passing ships after the game. I never saw him.’ Lambert revealed he did not speak to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) after their defeat on Saturday .","Christian Benteke was on the bench for Aston Villa against Chelsea .

"A drug manufacturer is being investigated by health experts in China who are looking into a possible link between the death of several babies and Government vaccines. A team of government investigators has been sent to Biokangtai, a drug maker based in the southern city of Shenzhen, state broadcaster China Central Television said, amid growing public concern about the safety of its products. The probe was launched after provincial and health authorities separately reported that since November, around a half-dozen babies died shortly after they received hepatitis B vaccines made by Biokangtai. Investigation: A drug manufacturer is being investigated by health experts in China . One case has been ruled out while the others were still being investigated. Repeated calls to Biokangtai's Shenzhen headquarters were disconnected after a few rings. In a statement earlier this month, the company said it was confident in the safety of its products and that the deaths could be caused by underlying diseases that were incubating in the babies and coincidentally started showing symptoms after the inoculations. 'Coincidental diseases arise the most easily and are the easiest to misinterpret,' the statement on Biokangtai's website said. A senior government expert in diseases said vaccine-related deaths could be due to coincidence, but that Biokangtai was not in the position to make an objective assessment. 'We should not treat the company's statement like a conclusion,' Dr. Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist with the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a phone interview. 'They may be trying to protect their self-interest. Or they may have a lot of confidence in their product.' Hepatitis B is a chronic liver infection that is spread through the blood or bodily fluids of infected people. It can cause liver inflammation and jaundice. The vaccines were being given to children free of charge as part of the government's national immunization program. But Chinese health authorities suspended the use of Biokangtai's hepatitis B vaccines last Friday after the first deaths of babies were reported. Vaccine: Since November, six babies died shortly after they received hepatitis B vaccines . Four babies reportedly died in the southern province of Guangdong - although one of them was said to have died from pneumonia. The National Health and Family Planning Commission reported that two babies in Hunan province and another in Sichuan had also died in a similar way. Public confidence in Chinese health authorities and the country's drug safety regime is shaky at best, though improvements have been made in recent years since government agencies dragged their feet and withheld information about the spread of SARS and bird flu. Concerns over vaccine safety have surfaced in recent years after media reports of problems with vaccines for encephalitis, hepatitis B and other diseases, though the health ministry said the vaccines had been improperly stored but were unrelated to subsequent illnesses that were reported. Zeng, the government expert, urged the public not to panic, saying that in general Chinese vaccines were safe and that more people would die if everyone refused inoculations due to worries about the recent deaths. 'If the public refuses to be vaccinated, or if they try to change the vaccination procedures, the consequence will be extremely bad,' Zeng said. 'Instead of several deaths, it will cause tens of thousands of deaths.'","Team of government investigators has been sent to Biokangtai .

"When Dele Alli was plucked from MK Dons by Tottenham Hotspur in a £5million deal on transfer deadline day, the name of one former Spurs youngster came to the minds of many - John Bostock. Could the 18-year-old who has been lighting up League One this season avoid becoming yet another English starlet who failed to live up to expectations after moving to a big club? MK Dons boss Karl Robinson has insisted in the past that the midfielder possesses a level of maturity beyond his tender years, and the question in the short term is whether Alli can keep his head down and maintain the level of performance that secured his transfer to Spurs in the first place. MK Dons midfielder Alli (right) vies for the ball with Bradford City's Joe Meredith . For the most part against Bradford City, the evidence suggested yes. One thing is for sure, the surface at White Hart Lane will never be as bad as it was at  Valley Parade on Monday night - and Alli's attempts to bring a level of control to midfield were certainly hampered in the early exchanges. Of course, there was always a chance that his touch suffered in the knowledge that, live on Sky Sports, there would be more eyes upon him than ever before in his short career.  Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino was, in all likelihood, watching on from somewhere. And tiredness couldn't have helped either. It had, after all, been little over 48 hours since MK Dons played out a 0-0 draw at home to Bristol City. MK Dons knew that a win would take them top of League One, while Bradford were hoping to end the night in the play-off places - and the first half was not exactly a classic. Alli was signed by Tottenham on transfer deadline day before being loaned back to MK Dons . Alli showed plenty of hustle and bustle, especially in his attempts to support lone striker Jonson Clarke-Harris at every available opportunity, but the first half was a struggle for the youngster. Things started better after the interval. One lively run down the right, while ultimately futile, did successfully showcase the strength and speed. Then, in the 54th minute, Alli opened the scoring after being assisted by the game's key player - the Valley Parade pitch. Bradford goalkeeper Jordan Pickford scuffed what should have been a straightforward clearance right into the path of Clarke-Harris on the edge of the area, the striker squared to Alli, and he made no mistake in sliding the ball under the red-faced keeper. Goal number 13 of the season, as cool as you like. Somewhere Pochettino would have been nodding approvingly. Alli (left) attempts to take the ball past Bradfod City's Gary Liddle during the first half . Bradford, however, recently came back from a two-goal deficit to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Compared to that, MK Dons at home is easy pickings, and just 15 minutes later they were ahead thanks to Billy Clark and James Hanson. Alli took it upon himself to try and get his side back into the game. First he appeared at left back to halt an opposition attack, then at right back in attempt to drive the Dons forward. But in the end it was defeat, and his fight to help MK Dons to promotion before his summer departure took something of a setback. One thing is for sure, though, Alli is definitely a talent. But if he is to succeed for Tottenham in the future, he will be far better off back on loan at Stadium MK next season - either in the Championship or League One - then warming the bench at White Hart Lane.","Tottenham signing Dele Alli impresses for MK Dons against Braford City .

"Trouble is brewing at OId Trafford as Louis van Gaal continues to struggle to haul his stuttering Manchester United side into form. Criticism is intensifying on the terraces as tactical decisions, including pushing Wayne Rooney into midfield, have come under scrutiny from the United fans as their richly talented side is still stalling in a crucial period of the season, having labored to a 1-1 draw at West Ham at the weekend. Despite spending heavily in the summer, results have not consistently arrived. Here are the stats that shame Manchester United's season so far... Louis van Gaal watches on as the Red Devils struggled to a late point against West Ham on Sunday afternoon . It's just like watching Moyes! Is Van Gaal getting off lightly compared to David Moyes?

In his new deep midfield role as United’s quarterback, Wayne Rooney has yet to register a single shot on target in 2015 despite playing for 450 minutes. He is already a fair way behind the midfielders with the most shots on target this calendar year: . The last time United came from behind to win in the Premier League was a 4-1 win against Aston Villa last season. They have conceded the first goal nine times this season — they drew five and lost four of those games.

"Louis van Gaal will not bring Premier League glory to Manchester United in his first season in charge, according to Queens Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp. Redknapp, who completed the signing of former United defender Rio Ferdinand on Thursday, cannot see the Dutchman winning the title in his debut season without 'four fantastic players' arriving at old Trafford in addition to the signings of Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera. 'Van Gaal's got a good track record but they need players,' Redknapp told talkSPORT. Van Gaal was all smiles as he took his fist press conference as Manchester United manager . The new United boss got to know his new surroundings with club legend Sir Bobby Charlton . 'He needs to bring four or five players in at least to get them back to where they were under Alex [Ferguson], where they were winning championships because they look well short of that at the moment. 'Certainly at this stage you wouldn’t want to bet on them winning the league next year. I wouldn’t see them winning it next year unless he suddenly pull three or four fantastic players out of the hat.' Redknapp pointed to the strength of title rivals, Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal as evidence that United will struggle to immediately reach the top again after David Moyes' disastrous reign.

"Wales have reacted to criticism of their handling of George North last Friday by insisting that he would have been replaced immediately had they known he had been knocked out. The Lions wing was left unconscious by a second blow to the head during his side’s 21-16 RBS 6 Nations loss to England at the Millennium Stadium, but he was not taken off. Team medical manager Prav Mathema on Monday night revealed that steps will be taken to ensure better access to TV coverage after confirming that he and his colleagues were unaware of the extent of North’s injury. In the first half, Dave Attwood accidentally struck North in the head with his boot and the 22-year-old was forced to go off for concussion tests, returning to the field eight minutes later. North (bottom) is inadvertently kicked in the face by England second row Dave Attwood on Friday .

North's (right) second apparent case of concussion came after a clash of heads with Richard Hibbard (left) Attempting to tackle England fullback Mike Brown (centre right), Hibbard's momentum also takes North . North lays motionless on the Millennium Stadium turf after the nasty-looking collision on Friday night . In the second half, North clashed heads with team-mate Richard Hibbard and collapsed to the ground with his arms by his sides — a clear indication of concussion. However, he was not taken off at that stage for assessment and played the final quarter in a dazed state. The vivid footage of his ordeal has led to a torrent of criticism aimed at the Welsh Rugby Union and last night — with World Rugby continuing an investigation into the events — Mathema said: ‘Regrettably, I was unsighted at the time of the second incident. The other pitch-side medic was also unsighted and all I saw was George North getting up off his knees. When I arrived on the scene he was completely lucid, conversing spontaneously with me. I undertook some on-pitch evaluations and at that point I deemed him fit to continue. The 22-year-old (left), missing a tackle on Jonathan Joseph, saw his game suffer after the first head injury . ‘Regrettably, we didn’t get a chance to see the incident and had I been given that opportunity there’s no doubt that he would have been removed from the field of play. There are no pitch-side replays available currently and the independent match-day doctor was also unable to aid us in that process. We unfortunately didn’t see it. Having seen it since, he looks like he had a momentary loss of consciousness and in that case, he should definitely have been removed from the field of play.’ Mathema suggested that the Wales coaches and analysts also missed the incident as they were reviewing an incident that occurred moments earlier. But he conceded that the process of monitoring such injuries was insufficient and will be immediately acted upon. ‘We’ve seen where our protocols need to improve,’ he said. ‘For the next four games of the Six Nations we’re going to have instant video replays. We’ve had a discussion with World Rugby and we hope that our discussions might spark some global intervention because sometimes pitch-side practitioners will need help. There will be rare occasions, like on Friday, where people are unsighted, so we need to enhance these protocols.’ North (right) and his captain Sam Warburton look on during Wales' defeat to England . North puts his hands on his knees and looks on during Wales' loss to England at the Millennium Stadium . In a detailed post-match examination and all subsequent tests, North has been deemed to be free of any concussion symptoms, and he appeared at a sponsors’ event yesterday. However, having belatedly viewed the alarming footage of the incident Wales have put him through return-to-play protocols as if he had been concussed. A decision will be made later in the week about his availability to face Scotland at Murrayfield on Sunday. Meanwhile, England head coach Stuart Lancaster says facilities to monitor live footage are available to his management and medical team at Twickenham. ‘There are definitely lessons to be learned,’ he said. ‘At the time, I didn’t see it — I don’t know if anyone did. Clearly, the ability to review footage and identify if a concussion has taken place is crucial. My understanding is that we do have that provision in place at Twickenham.’ World Rugby, formerly known as the International Rugby Board, have drafted the following guidelines: . What is concussion? A traumatic brain injury resulting in a disturbance of brain function. Common symptoms include headache, dizziness, memory disturbance or balance problems. Loss of consciousness, being knocked out, occurs in less than 10 per cent of concussions. What action do you take if you suspect concussion? The athlete should be immediately removed from play. Once safely removed from play, the injured player must not be returned to activity that day and until they are assessed. Concussion has been diagnosed, what next? A six-day graduated return to play programme (GRTP): . 1 - Rest for 24 hours — complete body and brain rest. 2 - Light aerobic exercise to increase heart rate. Light jogging for 10-15 minutes, swimming or stationary cycling at low to moderate intensity. No resistance training. 3 - Sport-specific exercise to add movement. Running drills, no head impact activities. 4 - Non-contact training drills to test co-ordination and cognitive load. Training and passing drills. May start progressive resistance training. 5 - Full contact practice so that functional skills can be assessed by coaching staff. Normal training. 6 - Player can return to play.","George North was knocked out following a clash of heads with team-mate Richard Hibbard in the second-half of his side's 21-16 loss to England .

"On his eighth birthday he was tied to a tree, doused in petrol and set on fire. The inferno left Robbie Middleton with third-degree burns to 99 per cent of his body. No-one expected him to survive. But in a story of staggering courage, Robbie lived. He endured 200 operations and endless therapy to repair the burns. Tragically, he was to die just weeks short of his 21st birthday from a cancer which doctors blamed on the original injuries. Final statement: Robbie Middleton is pictured shortly before his death in 2011 around the time when the statement was made where he accused Don Collins of sexual assault . Before: Two pictures showing Robbie Middleton as a young boy before he was attacked near his home on his eighth birthday in 1998 by a 13-year-old Don Collins . After years of such terrible suffering, Robbie’s premature death was to have one positive outcome . In a harrowing 17-minute video made . just before he died, he named the man he believed had torched him in . Splendora, Texas, in 1998. And he also claimed that he had been . raped by the same person, a 13-year-old neighbour called Don Collins, . two weeks before being set alight. The terrible act was, Robbie alleged, a way of ensuring his silence. His accusations have opened the way for Collins, now a 27-year-old convicted sex offender, to be charged with felony murder. The charge is only made for a criminal offence which has happened in conjunction with another crime. Accused: A mugshot of the alleged attacker Don Collins . Montgomery County attorney David . Walker is changing the charges in order to be able to prosecute Don . Collins as an adult, despite the fact that committed the crime as a . juvenile. Mr Walker also hopes that the . additional accusations of sexual assault will not only explain the . torching, but also explain why it took so long for Mr Collins to be . prosecuted. ‘It was done to prevent Middleton . from talking,' Walker told the Houston Chronicle. 'It provides the . bridge that we needed for the delay, rather than saying we didn't have . sufficient staffing or something else.' Robert Ray ‘Robbie’ Middleton was . celebrating his eight birthday in 29th April 1998 when he met his . neighbour Don Collins on a wooden path near their homes in Splendora, . Montgomery County. Two weeks earlier, according to . Robbie Middleton’s statement before his death, the pair had met in the . same spot and Mr Collins, then 13, had overpowered the young boy and . raped him. Now he wanted him silenced. ‘Don grabbed me by my shoulder and . threw gas in my face, after that I don't really remember anything,’ Robbie Middleton said in the video statement. The Schulenburg Sticker  reported that his mother Colleen said during the trial: 'It was so hard to take in what my eyes were seeing. 'All of his hair was scorched, and there was skin hanging around his ankles. 'A little while later, I walked down to the tree where it happened. There was a perfect outline of Robbie’s body scorched into the bark of the tree.' Don Collins was not prosecuted for . the crime, although police statements reveal that he was held in custody . after he made statements only a person at the scene could have made. In 2001, aged 16, Don Collins was jailed for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old boy. Robbie Middleton’s resulting third . degree burns on 99 per cent of his body led the young boy spent most of . his life in a specialist unit at Shriners Burn Hospital in Galveston. The rehabilitation, which included . over 200 operations and skin grafts, was excruciating, but his mother said he . never gave in to self pity and anger. The Schulenburg Sticker reported how one of the surgeons described how during the first few months at Shriners, the little boy suffered nightmares, convinced that he was being burned again. Homicide: Robbie Middleton suffered third-degree burns on 99 per cent of his body, and the following 200 operations and skin grafts are what led to his rare cancer diagnose from which he died in 2011 . But his haunted sleep was especially dangerous because if he moved about too much, he risked tearing his newly-grafted skin. ‘I grieved for a long time but after a . while, Robert became the same happy-go-lucky child and life was good, . life was liveable again,' his mother Colleen told CNN in March this . year. Mrs Middleton said of her son's . decision to name Collins: 'He did it because was afraid that Don might . attack another child and that was Robert's motivation for giving that . deposition.’ Robert Middleton died from skin cancer in April 2011 shortly before his 21st birthday. A medical examiner ruled that Mr . Middleton’s death was a homicide as the particular type of cancer he . suffered from can only come from enduring skin grafts for serious burns. The 27-minute long statement was made from his hospital bed in which he accuses Don Collins of sexual assault. As graphic pictures shown to the jury revealed the horrifying extent of the youngster's injuries, many openly wept at the images. First step: Colleen and Bobby Middleton were awarded the biggest compensation in history, $150 billion, when they successfully sued Don Collins in a civil lawsuit last year . His scorched skin was blackened, his eyelids had been burned off and his body looked like a charred patchwork. A judge had to order that a box of . tissues was passed around the jury box as members gasped at the extent . of the wounds the boy had miraculously survived, the Schulenburg Sticker . reported. They heard how the boy had to routinely endure skin grafts, which were then cut away, to allow the boy's bones room to grow as it was too inflexible to allow movement, before eventually being stitched up again, it was reported. After each of the 200 operations, the Schulenburg Sticker reported how Robbie was 'stretched' by braces to try and give his skin a little elasticity. Because of these prolonged periods where he was strapped to braces, he had to learn how to walk time and time again. Colleen and her husband Bobby won a . civil lawsuit against Don Collins in 2011, awarding them with $150 . billion, the biggest settlement in U.S history. Attorney Craig Sico says the punitive . damage award is symbolic and the Middleton family, from Montgomery . County, Texas, expects none of it will be paid. At the time of the lawsuit Mrs Middleton told ABC: 'I wasn't expecting it to turn out as well as it did. We just wanted justice. 'It tells me that they understood that he was a precious human being and he didn't deserve what happened to him.' Neither Collins nor any attorney appeared for him at the civil trial. After filing murder charges in . September, Montgomery County attorney David Walker has now dismissed in . and filed a new charge of felony murder . Coleen Middleton has said she . supports dismissing the murder charge for felony murder: ‘Our lawyers . see this is a strategic move, one that is moving in the right . direction.’","Robbie Middleton was doused in gasoline and set on fire on his eighth birthday in 1998 .

Blackett failed to deal with an early delivery from the Blues and the ball fell to Andreas Christensen, but he shot wide from eight yards at a tight angle.

Soon after Young was replaced having played an hour of football on his return to action, having missed five games with a hamstring injury. Chelsea fully deserved their lead and Brown once again impressed.

"Nigel Pearson revealed he had spent Sunday afternoon in Sheffield’s Greystones pub watching a Canadian folk band — which he did not enjoy. He also admitted he could be a hard man to reach — deliberately. He changes his mobile phone number twice a year and is not the sort to engage in idle chat over the garden fence. Nor is he on Twitter. ‘I’m a miserable b****r, you know,’ said 51-year-old Pearson. ‘I don’t speak to my neighbours.’ On Sunday evening it was widely speculated that Nigel Pearson had been sacked by the club . However, the club refuted those claims three hours later - insisting that he will be in charge against Arsenal . 'What about a phone call? ‘My cat was sitting on my knee all afternoon. I was like Blofeld. I’m not someone who is particularly gregarious. Let’s put it like that.’ But during Monday’s media briefing at the King Power Stadium Pearson did not reveal what actually happened to him on Sunday. Instead, he remained defiant while citing company confidentiality and his own principles of loyalty, especially at a time when he should be preparing for Tuesday’s game at Arsenal. Pearson also took a swipe at BBC’s Match of the Day, branding host Gary Lineker and pundits Danny Murphy and Jermaine Jenas the ‘three fountains of knowledge’ while accusing them of stirring trouble. The 51-year-old has remained tight-lipped over his future as Leicester City manager . The 51-year-old also hit the headlines for Saturday's touchline antics with Crystal Palace's James McArthur . The timeline of Pearson's 'sacking' on Sunday . He insisted they had made ‘a mountain out of a molehill’ by dwelling on his touchline tussle with Crystal Palace’s James McArthur during Leicester’s 1-0 home defeat on Saturday and a post-match interview when the manager promised he could ‘look after himself’. ‘I thought they were slightly disruptive. I don’t care what they think of me,’ said Pearson, adding cryptically: ‘I pay my tax bill.’ His remarks provoked a swift reaction from Lineker. The Leicester-born club legend, and now MOTD frontman, is familiar with the workings of Twitter and he responded: ‘Ah Nigel Pearson is blaming MOTD for making a mountain out of a molehill. We’d best be careful in future, the fella can look after himself.’ Asked if he was a ‘fountain of knowledge’, Lineker added: ‘If I was I’d tell you that he was sacked by one of the owners’ family and reinstated by another, but then I’m not.’ It seemed to confirm a chain of events in which chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who was at the Palace game, had taken the decision to change the manager — and implemented it — only to be talked out of it later by his son, Aiyawatt ‘Top’ Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester’s vice-chairman, who was in Thailand on business. How the Daily Mail newspaper reported Pearson's incident with McArthur on Monday morning . Leicester City boss Pearson (left) put his hands round the neck of James McArthur . McArthur (centre) slides into Pearson after he is upended by Leicester midfielder Marc Albrighton . Four hours passed on Sunday after news of the story started to leak out — again, Lineker was among those circulating the ‘news’ to his 3.5million Twitter followers — and before the club statement insisting Pearson remained in charge. ‘The timescale was a lot different for me, put it like that,’ said Pearson, who noticed no expressions of shock among the players when he appeared for training yesterday morning. ‘I didn’t see anybody with their jaw on the floor. ‘Everybody in their generation is social-media savvy these days. I’m certainly not, and I don’t watch 24-hour sports channels. I’m not that sort of an animal. So don’t make assumptions about that, either. I was aware of it but I didn’t see it. ‘We have meetings on a Monday morning. Not specifically about that. It was just a general chat about turning positive performances into results. I may or may not have spoken about the weekend in its entirety. I had an interesting Sunday.’ Was it his strangest day? ‘I’ve had some very strange days in football, let me tell you,’ he said. ‘I spent the day at home. I might have gone to the pub. ‘There was a Canadian folk band. They weren’t very good. It was a different type of a day. Pearson has taken a swipe at Match of The Day pundits, including Gary Linekar, for making 'a mountain out of a molehill' ‘Sundays when you lose are not always easy to deal with. I had a few chats with friends. My lad came over. We had a chat. I’m in a job where you’re going to be scrutinised and when it comes your way you might not like it and I might not deal with it as others would choose me to deal with it but I am myself. I don’t pretend to be anybody else.’ Pearson stood firm and refused to apologise earlier in the season when he told a Leicester fan who was shouting abuse at him during a game to ‘F*** off and die’. He was fined by the FA and banned from the touchline for one game. ‘Some people criticise me for not being animated enough, for sitting in stands and not showing any passion,’ he said. ‘I come down, get involved in a couple of situations and all of a sudden, it’s a slightly different angle. ‘I’m a human being and I will make mistakes from time to time but any mistakes I make are very honest ones. And I don’t have any regrets.’ Pearson has faced the music and is still standing. He is not planning to retreat to the stands at the Emirates Stadium. ‘I think I’ll be on the touchline, in the hinterland of the technical area,’ he said. ‘I don’t know yet. I might go and sit with the owners.’","Nigel Pearson was embroiled in a bizarre exchange with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur on Saturday .

"Manchester City are continuing to monitor Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone amid growing concern over their faltering season. The Barclays Premier League champions slipped seven points behind leaders Chelsea after Saturday’s 1-1 home draw with struggling Hull City. Manuel Pellegrini’s side are now in danger of finishing the season empty-handed after going out of both domestic cup competitions in the early rounds. Much will depend on how they fare in the Champions League having scraped through to the knockout stage. Diego Simeone is being monitored by Manchester City as their season continues to falter . Manuel Pellegrini's City side have not won in their last four and have fallen seven points behind Chelsea . Spanish league champions Atletico beat city rivals Real Madrid 4-0 in La Liga over the weekend . 7- After just nine years in management Simeone has already won seven major honours — including La Liga, the Copa del Rey and Europa League. 64.3- His win percentage in his three-and-a-half seasons as Atletico manager. 4- The number of times Simeone’s Atletico have beaten arch-rivals Real Madrid this season. They have also had two draws. On February 24 City face Barcelona for the second season in a row and another defeat for Pellegrini would raise serious questions over the Chilean’s future. Simeone led Atletico to the Spanish title last season as well as the Champions League final, where they lost to rivals Real. His stock rose even higher after Atletico inflicted a 4-0 defeat on Carlo Ancelotti’s European champions in Saturday’s Madrid derby. The 44-year-old Argentine is the likely target if City feel Pellegrini should go. Both Ancelotti and Bayern Munich’s Pep Guardiola are less likely to leave their clubs while Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp is having a poor season. City’s immediate task is to improve their results, starting at Stoke tomorrow. Pablo Zabaleta, the champions’ Argentina full back, admits his side must win at the Britannia Stadium or risk losing touch with Chelsea. Pablo Zabaleta (left) believes that City could rediscover their form by playing away from the Etihad . City striker Sergio Aguero has found that his goalscoring touch has deserted him during recent matches . ‘We are under pressure. We have to win every game,’ said Zabaleta. ‘Chelsea won and Southampton won, United are close behind us, while Spurs are in a great moment. ‘Every game is like a final, and we have Champions League coming up in the next few weeks. If we want to be trying to retain the title, we need to win the games.’ Pellegrini’s team will not find it easy — Stoke won at the Etihad in August — and Zabaleta admitted: ‘They play in a physical way, and are very strong at home. ‘They have changed their style of play with Mark Hughes, but still have most of the players from a few years ago, and are a really good team. We have to be ready.’ Zabaleta admitted that playing away from the Etihad could help City rediscover their form. ‘It’s been very strange because this team have not been great at home, and that is something that has not happened before,’ he said. ‘We have always been strong at home, and this season if you look at the points we have lost at home, it is really hard to understand.’ Much could depend on whether Sergio Aguero rediscovers his scoring spark and Zabaleta said: ‘We need Sergio to come back to his goalscoring best like in November-December. City will try to end their winless streak when they play Stoke, who are managed by former boss Mark Hughes . ‘But after being injured for a long time for some players it is difficult to come back to their best. I am sure as soon as Sergio scores one goal then he will again be one of the best strikers in the league. ‘Also, defensively we are not doing great. We are conceding goals every game. Clean sheets are always important. There are defensive and offensive things we need to improve if we are to win something this season.’","Manchester City were held to a 1-1 at home by Hull on Saturday .

"Manchester United travel to America on Friday as the club prepare for this summer's tour of the US. Following Louis van Gaal's first press conference, the Dutchman will be getting to know his squad over the next week ahead of United's friendly against LA Galaxy next Thursday. Follow Sportsmail's coverage as Van Gaal's Red Devils prepare for the Stateside tour. Host commentator . The French defender, who seems set for a move to Italian giants Juventus, is also missing from the squad. Peculiarly, Nick Powell, whom some believe has a decent shout of making an impact at Old Trafford this season, has been left out too. Anderson has been left out of Manchester United's squad for the tour of America after suffering a calf injury during pre-season training, according to the club's official website. The midfielder, who spent part of last season on loan at Fiorentina, will remain at the club's training complex to continue his rehabilitation. Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera have both been named in Van Gaal's 25-man squad and were snapped wearing Manchester United's club suits. Wayne Rooney will be eager to impress his new boss... particularly in the absence of strike partner Robin van Persie who Van Gaal knows all about. Goalkeepers: David De Gea, Anders Lindegaard, Ben Amos, Sam Johnstone. Defenders: Rafael, Jonny Evans, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Tyler Blackett, Michael Keane, Reece James. Midfielders: Ander Herrera, Tom Cleverley, Darren Fletcher, Ashley Young, Wilfried Zaha, Shinji Kagawa, Juan Mata, Antonio Valencia, Nani, Jesse Lingard. Forwards: Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney, Will Keane. From Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel . While Louis van Gaal was being unveiled on Thursday, two Manchester United old boys were putting thoughts of Old Trafford behind them. Rio Ferdinand, released by United at the end of the season, wrapped up his move to Queens Park Rangers by signing a 12-month contract. And former United boss David Moyes was soaking up the sunshine as he watched the first round of The Open at Hoylake. From Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell . Michael Carrick damaged ligaments his ankle and will be out for 10 weeks, new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal revealed on Thursday. Sportsmail understands the 32-year-old midfielder suffered damage to a bone in his left ankle and underwent surgery on Thursday morning to establish the extent of the damage. Click the above link to read the full story . For the first time in 12 seasons, Rio Ferdinand will not be attending Manchester United's summer tour. Having signed for the Red Devils from Leeds in 2002, the former England centre-back joined Harry Redknapp's QPR on a one-year deal on Thursday evening. Manchester United aren't the only club preparing to go on tour this summer. In total, Premier League sides will rack up over 175,000 air miles. Click the above link to read the full story. That's right, there will be around 120 members of the United team in America this week. Between 32 and 39 players - minus the injured Michael Carrick - will travel with coaching staff, admin staff and directors. From Sportsmail's Craig Hope . MUTV are evidently keen to get behind the new regime and the new trailer which slams the Moyes era is a bold production given its setting on an in-house station. But in an age where we criticise clubs for the propaganda-like offerings from their official websites and TV channels, MUTV should at least be applauded for refusing to ignore their disastrous last campaign. We're not too sure David Moyes will agree with that sentiment, however. Click the above link to read the full story... The Louis van Gaal era at Manchester United looks to have started already as the diggers moved into the club’s Carrington training complex. The Dutchman spoke to the media on Thursday for the first time since being appointed as Manchester United boss and described facilities as 'fantastic' but said something must be done about how windy it gets. 'The (training ground) needs some more intimacy and I have asked (for that) already,' Van Gaal explained. Click the above link to read the full story... Flight times for the tour were put back around ten days ago and so the club will now fly at 3pm rather than 12.30pm. The squad are scheduled to take a light training session this morning as the side's England contingent make a return following World Cup duty. The players must finish by 12pm in order to check-in at the airport at 1. Rooney is looking forward to United's upcoming trip and has said on his Facebook page: 'Can't wait to get back to training today and then leave for our pre-season tour of America. Looking forward to seeing the lads and getting started!' Thursday, July 24: LA Galaxy (Chevrolet FC Cup - Rose Bowl, Pasadena) 3.30am . Saturday, July 26: Roma (Guinness International Champions Cup - SA Field, Denver) 9.10pm . Wednesday, July 30: Inter Milan (Guinness International Champions Cup - FedExField, Washington) Midnight . Saturday, August 2: Real Madrid (Guinness International Champions Cup - Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor) 9.06pm . Van Gaal is seriously racking up the air miles. Just a few days after arriving in England having guided Holland to the World Cup semi-finals, the new United boss has had to pack his bags once more for the trip to America. The Red Devils will be facing some world-class opposition over in the States - taking part in the Guinness International Champions Cup as well as the Chevrolet FC Cup. Anderson, Bebe and Nani arrived for training but all three players face an uncertain future at the club. Uncertainty hangs over the future over wideman Nani while Anderson and Bebe were both loaned out last season. From Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler . He started by talking about the honour of taking his first few steps as Manchester United manager alongside Sir Bobby Charlton. By the time Louis van Gaal was up and running on Thursday, however, it was clear he won’t need any assistance finding his own way in English football. It will be Van Gaal’s way or nothing. Click the above link to read what Van Gaal had to say during his first press conference as United manager. Having left Brazil early following England's disappointing elimination from the World Cup at the group stage, Wayne Rooney is back and ready for United's assault on the Premier League. Sportsmail understands the squad will train this morning before taking a coach to Manchester airport this afternoon. Van Gaal and his side will then travel Stateside at around 3pm. The Red Devils are about to embark on their tour of the US with fans set to get a glimpse of new signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera. Van Gaal was one of the first to arrive at United's Carrington training base on Friday morning.

"Arsene Wenger was noting the similarities between Alexis Sanchez and former Arsenal star Ian Wright, when he highlighted one key difference. ‘He is quieter than Ian Wright, but that is not difficult,’ the Arsenal manager joked. Arsenal sorely missed Sanchez, their stand-out player since his £30million move from Barcelona in the summer, in the north London derby defeat to Tottenham. But the Chilean has recovered from a hamstring injury which kept him out of the match and Wenger was assessing his condition in training on Monday before deciding whether to start him in Tuesday’s match against Leicester City. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was monitoring Alexis Sanchez's condition in training on Monday . The 26-year-old is back for Arsenal to face Leicester City on Tuesday evening after returning to training . Sanchez has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season — including 12 in the Barclays Premier League — and has impressed Wenger with his tireless work rate as much as his attacking ability. ‘He is dynamic and he does both parts of the game. He’s important in the team because of that,’ Wenger explained. ‘He wins you the ball back quickly as well. The transitions are very good from defence to attack and attack to defence. ‘He is a bit like Ian Wright. His enthusiasm is like the enthusiasm of Ian Wright.’ Like Wright, who was the joker in the pack during his time in north London in addition to being a blistering goalscorer, Sanchez is a popular member of the Arsenal dressing room. At the moment he spends more time with the Spanish-speaking players, largely because he has only started to pick up English following his summer transfer. Wenger has likened Sanchez to former Arsenal legend Ian Wright - who like the Chilean scored goals for fun . Wright celebrates the Gunners' FA Cup success over Newcastle at Wembley Stadium in May 1998 . But Wenger revealed he is ‘loved by everybody’ and added: ‘He is very friendly and bubbly every day.’ The Arsenal boss was not prepared to risk Sanchez against Tottenham in case he aggravated his hamstring to the point that it ruled him out for the remainder of the season. Wenger sees the 26-year-old as crucial to his side’s chances of finishing in the top four this season, thus qualifying for the Champions League. ‘It was difficult for him not to play against Tottenham,’ Wenger said. ‘If it was the last game of the season he would’ve played. 'He had a bit of a winter break now that he didn’t really want. But he got one and I think he will now be recovered and fit until the end of the season. ‘For us it is important that he has no setback as once you go into February, if you have a muscular injury and a guy has a setback, you say “bye bye” as the season is over as it is six weeks out. 'By the time you come back to your full level it is April and that is why we didn’t take the gamble.’","Arsenal were without star man Alexis Sanchez as they fell to a narrow defeat at the hands of arch-rivals Tottenham on Saturday .

"Mauricio Pochettino has the Spurs seniors heading to Wembley - and now the youth team fancy a bit of cup glory as well. A double from Anthony Georgiou and another from Ismail Azzaoui powered Tottenham to a deserved win over Manchester United and set up a sixth round trip to Nottingham Forest in the FA Youth Cup. With a Capital One Cup final with Chelsea to look forward to, plus the warm memories of Saturday’s Harry Kane heroics against Arsenal, these are good times to be a Spurs fan and the feel-good factor has spread to the club’s academy too. Tottenham's youth side beat Manchester United 3-1 to reach the sixth round of the FA Youth Cup . Ismail Azzaoui (right) continued his impressive form in the tournament with a goal in the victory . Azzaoui (left) slots past Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson (centre) to score for Tottenham .

Substitutes not used: Dorrington (GK); Thompson, Croskery, Scott . Scorer: Rashford 25 . Booked: Rashford . Referee: Stephen Ross . They were simply too strong for their visitors and undeterred when Marcus Rashford’s brilliant free-kick drew United level midway through the first-half. Taking complete command after the break, they found the necessary goals to prove their superiority and reached the last eight with plenty in reserve. This was arguably the stand-out tie of the fifth round, with both Spurs and United having designs on winning the competition for the fourth and 11th times respectively, and it was rightly given the grand old stage of White Hart Lane. Spurs had defeated Blackburn Rovers and Wolves to reach this stage, while United had seen off Bury and Hull City. A win here and both could realistically start thinking about lifting the trophy. Despite this, the game started at a slow pace and it was the quarter-hour before either side had a sniff of goal. The lively Azzaoui, who scored a hat-trick for Spurs in the third round and another goal in the fourth, floated in a cross from the right and Christian Maghoma beat keeper Dean Henderson in the air, only to see his header drop wide of the post. But they had their reward shortly afterwards and Belgium youth international Azzaoui was involved again. This time he swung in a testing low corner that Anton Walkes flicked on at the near post and Georgiou tapped in from a couple of yards out. Georgiou, a Cypriot youth player, is a regular scorer for the under 18 side but it’s doubtful he’ll have too many simpler chances than this as United’s defence dozed. Their funk was short-lived, however, and the visitors drew level five minutes later in spectacular fashion. Tyler Reid was clipped about 30 yards from goal and Rashford, sizing up the situation, had no other thought but to shoot. He produced a vicious shot of pace and dip that was perfectly placed to beat the outstretched glove of Harry Voss and land in the bottom corner. The Manchester-born frontman, 17, made a name for himself in this competition last season and is clearly up for the Cup again. Slowly, United clicked into the passing rhythm that is the hallmark of all their sides at all age groups and Callum Gribbin, who scored twice against Hull, came close with a curling effort after Zach Dearnley had beaten two defenders on the right. At the other end, Henderson dived low to his left to keep out Shayon Harrison’s effort following a purposeful run through the middle.

Tottenham's Shayon Harrison (right) was denied a goal with a good save from United goalkeeper Henderson . Azzaoui (left) is congratulated by Tottenham manager Kieran McKenna (right) after being substituted . United had the ball in the net on their first attack of the second-half; Cameron Borthwick-Jackson playing a one-two with Timothy Fosu-Mensah inside the box before finishing, but celebrations were cut short by the linesman’s flag. These fine margins counted against United and within seconds they were behind again. Joshua Onomah had the presence of mind to spot the unmarked Azzaoui wide on the left and he had ample time to compose himself before lifting the ball over Henderson. Suddenly, the game was stretched and United captain Axel Tuanzebe stuck out a leg to stop Harrison’s goalbound shot on the turn, before Reid rampaged down the wing to draw a sharp save from Voss. With 20 minutes left, Spurs took full control when Kyle Walker-Peters sprung Georgiou clear down the right. His pace was too hot for Borthwick-Jackson and the Spurs man closed in before poking the ball between the legs of Henderson for his second of the evening. It proved the game-killer. Spurs are on the march in a Cup competition once again.","Tottenham win emphatically over Manchester United in FA Youth Cup .

"Extremely pleased: Professor John Walker-Smith, pictured here in 2007, won his appeal against the GMC . A doctor struck off over the MMR jab controversy yesterday won a High Court battle to clear his name. Professor John Walker-Smith had been found guilty of professional misconduct following claims he took part in unapproved research  that suggested links between the vaccine, bowel disease  and autism. However, a judge overturned the General Medical Council’s ruling and criticised its disciplinary panel’s ‘inadequate and superficial reasoning’ – but also stressed there was ‘no respectable body of opinion’ supporting the supposed risks of the jab. Professor Walker-Smith lost his licence to practise in May 2010 along with Dr Andrew Wakefield, who led the research. A GMC ‘fitness to practise’ panel found both men guilty of misconduct over the way the work was conducted after 217 days of deliberation – the longest disciplinary case in the body’s 150- year history. Professor Walker-Smith, 75, always denied allegations that he had participated in the research under the guise of carrying out clinical investigations and treatment of young patients, including colonoscopies, at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. The retired doctor said the work was necessary for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment, and was not done to aid the research. Mr Justice Mitting criticised the disciplinary panel’s ‘inadequate and superficial reasoning’ and ‘wrong conclusions’ before ruling:  ‘The panel’s determination cannot stand. I therefore quash it.’ He called for such cases to be overseen by someone with ‘judicial experience’ in future. The MMR vaccination programme suffered a blow when Dr Andrew Wakefield suggested a link between the jab, bowel disease and autism in the late 1990s . As he left court with relatives, Professor Walker-Smith said: ‘I am extremely pleased with the outcome of my appeal. There has been a great burden on me and my family since the allegations were first made in 2004 and throughout the hearing that ran from 2007 to 2010. I am relieved that this matter is now over.’ Mr Justice Mitting added that Dr Wakefield’s comments and subsequent publicity about possible links between autism and the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, ‘had a predictable adverse effect upon the take-up of the vaccine’ which was ‘of great concern to those responsible for public health’. He stressed: ‘There is now no respectable body of opinion which supports [Dr Wakefield’s] hypothesis that MMR vaccine and autism [or] enterocolitis are causally linked.’ Dr Helen Bedford, a senior lecturer at the UCL Institute of Child Health, added: ‘There has never been any sound evidence of a link. Indeed, there is a strong body of research showing no link. However, many parents who were anxious about the safety of the MMR vaccine decided not to have their children immunised. ‘Fortunately, it is never too late to have the MMR vaccine and I would strongly recommend that young people who missed out when they were younger have two doses of the vaccine to protect them.’ The GMC’s chief executive, Niall Dickson, said ‘key changes’ to its disciplinary hearings were already being prepared.","Prof John Walker-Smith had carried .

"Escaped: Hyeonseo Lee fled North Korea after the country was devastated by famine . A young woman who fled North Korea has revealed the horrific details of her upbringing in the pariah state, where she first saw someone executed when she was just seven-years-old. Hyeonseo Lee was brainwashed to believe that the country, run by the murderous Kim regime, was the greatest in the world. But when her eyes were opened to the desperate poverty and repression all around her, she knew she had to escape, and is now devoted to raising global awareness of her fellow countrymen's plight. Ms Lee spoke about her ordeal in a lecture at the TED conference in Long Beach, California, published by CNN. She told how she grew up convinced that North Korea was the best place to live as she sang patriotic songs with titles such as 'Nothing to Envy'. 'When I was seven-years-old, I saw my first public execution - but I thought my life in North Korea was normal,' she said. It was not until 1995, during the first of a series of devastating famines to grip the country, that she first realised how serious was the plight of many North Koreans. Her mother received a heart-wrenching letter from the sister of a colleague, and read it out to Ms Lee. 'When . you read this, all five family members will not exist in this world, . because we haven't eaten for the past two weeks,' the letter read. 'We . are lying on the floor together, and our bodies are so weak we are ready . to die.' Scroll down for video . Opening up: Ms Lee revealed her ordeal in a lecture at the TED conference recently . Heartbreaking: Hyeonseo Lee said seeing starving children like these young boys, pictured on a slide she used in her lecture, prompted her to escape from North Korea to China . Watch the full speech here . A short time later, she saw another shocking sight outside a train station - a woman was lying on the ground apparently dead, with a starving child in her arms staring at her face. 'Nobody helped them, because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families,' Ms Lee said. She decided to take the extreme risk of escaping across the Amrok River which divides North Korea from China. At . the time, only a few dozen North Koreans fled the country each year - . though enough tried and failed that dead bodies could often been seen . floating down the river after failed escape attempts. Crossing: The narrow stretch of river which forms the border between the two countries . Ms Lee successfully crossed the border, leaving her family behind - but she was not yet out of danger entirely. Because China is North Korea's closest ally, it refuses to recognise the refugee status of those who flee the country, instead classifying them as illegal immigrants. If Ms Lee had been caught by the Chinese authorities, she would have been returned to her home country and probably imprisoned or even executed. She spent a decade hiding her true . identity in China - although the police once interrogated her on . suspicion of secretly being North Korean, her Chinese was good enough to . fool them. Hermit state: This image from Ms Lee's talk shows how North Korea is bereft of electricity . The defector then moved on to South Korea, arriving in 2008 and receiving a new apartment and college education. However, although South Korea generally welcomes refugees from the North, Ms Lee's decision was not without risk as the authorities in her home country have been known to inflict harsh punishments on those who have relatives in the South. So when North Korean officials intercepted money she had sent to her family, Ms Lee knew she would have to move quickly to save them from a grisly fate. She daringly returned to the North, and escorted them on a 2,000-mile bus journey through China to the South-East Asian state of Laos. Dictator: Kim Jong Un is the latest member of his dynasty to repress the country's citizens . When the vehicle was stopped by a Chinese policeman, Ms Lee feared the worst, but managed to rescue her relatives from the danger. 'As the Chinese officer approached my family, I impulsively stood up, and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning,' she said. 'He looked at me suspiciously, but luckily he believed me.' The family reached Laos, but the vulnerable immigrants were placed in jail by corrupt officials and Ms Lee could not afford to pay the bribes which would ensure their release. An Australian backpacker saw her weeping on the street, and after asking what was wrong went to an ATM to withdraw the money she needed. When she asked why he was helping her, he replied: 'I'm not helping you - I'm helping the North Korean people.' Ms Lee is now campaigning for more international support for North Korean defectors and their families in order to help reintegrate the hermit nation with the rest of the world. Over the past five years, an average of 2,400 people have fled the country annually.","Hyeonseo Lee grew up devoted to North Korea and its Kim regime .

"A seven-year-old who developed narcolepsy after having the swine flu vaccine has been refused compensation because he is not ill enough – despite the fact he sleeps for 19 hours a day. Josh Hadfield developed the condition within three weeks of receiving the injection and now suffers ‘attacks’ which can cause him to doze throughout the day. Until he started medication he fell asleep up to every five minutes - even when he was walking, eating and swimming - and suffered sudden seizures when he laughed. Josh Hadfield (pictured with his mother, Caroline) developed narcolepsy within three weeks of having the Pandemrix jab. Without medication, he falls asleep up to every five minutes . Earlier this year, the Government admitted that the Pandemrix jab could be to blame and Josh’s mother Caroline hoped she would get financial assistance to deal with his condition. But Josh has now been told he does not have a ‘severe’ enough disability to qualify for compensation. Ms Hadfield, 42, declared the decision ‘disgusting’ and said the condition had irreversibly changed his life. She said: ‘At the end of the day this vaccine has irreversibly changed his life forever and there’s nothing we can do about this. ‘He has to take a very, very strong cocktail of drugs each day just to get through the day.’ Josh received the vaccine at his local GP surgery on January 21, 2010 after his mother was told he was ‘at risk’ of the H1N1 virus because he was under five. Ms Hadfield hoped to receive compensation to help her pay for Josh's care but she was told that he is not ill enough to qualify for a payout . But Ms Hadfield, of Frome, Somerset, said that within weeks of him having the vaccine she noticed a drastic change in her son. ‘He was a perfectly healthy energetic four-year-old before the vaccination, but within two weeks he was getting more tired and after three weeks he was sleeping for 19 hours a day. ‘Things then developed quickly and he struggled to walk. ‘Nothing could convince me it was anything but the jab which caused Josh’s conditions. ‘The Government had a knee-jerk reaction to swine flu and put out this vaccine, giving it to very young children.’ Ms Hadfield, 42, declared the decision 'disgusting' and said the condition had irreversibly changed Josh's life . Josh is now on medication to control the condition but the family lives in constant fear of narcolepsy attacks. Ms Hadfield, a civil servant, said: ‘Laughter can trigger attacks and sometimes he is too anxious to go out for fear of an incident. ‘You see other children who can laugh and enjoy things and yes Josh can laugh and enjoy things but his reaction means that he goes unconscious. ‘We feel we are constantly treading on eggshells.’ The vaccine was widely used in the UK during the 2009 to 2010 flu pandemic and was given to almost one million children between the ages of six-months-old and five-years-old. Ms Hadfield said: 'At the end of the day this vaccine has irreversibly changed his life forever and there's nothing we can do about this. He has to take a very, very strong cocktail of drugs each day just to get through the day' However, since 2011 it has not been given to people under the age of 20 because of the risk of narcolepsy. The UK Health Protection Agency has found that giving the jab to young children increases their chance of developing narcolepsy by 14 times. Researchers estimate that the chance of developing narcolepsy after receiving a dose of the vaccine is somewhere between one in 52,000 and one in 52,750. Last month, the Government made a dramatic U-turn over Josh’s condition, admitting that, ‘on the balance of probability the jab contributed to his condition’. Josh received the vaccine at his local GP surgery on January 21, 2010 after his mother was told he was 'at risk' of the H1N1 virus because he was under five . But they then added: ‘It has not been accepted that disablement from vaccination is severe, i.e. at least 60 per cent.’ Families could be entitled to £120,000 through the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme if they can prove ‘severe’ disability. But Ms Hadfield said: ‘Basically to get compensation you need to have something along the lines of loss of eyesight, loss of hearing, loss of limbs or basically not being able to do anything at all which I think is absolutely disgusting.’ The UK Health Protection Agency has found that giving the jab to young children increases their chance of developing narcolepsy by 14 times . A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions, which runs the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme, said: ‘DWP has looked at some vaccine damage payments cases again in light of new information regarding swine flu and narcolepsy provided by the Department for Health. ‘We cannot comment on the specifics of individual cases but can confirm that once this new information was taken into account it was decided, on balance of probability, in some cases that causation was proved.’ Ms Hadfield has now applied for legal aid to appeal against the decision. Narcolepsy, which occurs in one in every 2,000 people, is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. It is a long-term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns. Symptoms include, sleep attacks, daytime sleepiness and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion. It is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease, they attack healthy cells. In the case of narcolepsy, antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep-regulating chemical. There is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed, for example, by taking regular naps, eating healthily and exercising. In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help. It is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the jab, Pandemrix, one has developed narcolepsy. Researchers, who published their findings in the British Medical Journal, studied 75 children with narcolepsy and found that 11 of these had received the vaccine before their symptoms began. The vaccine is associated with a 14-fold increase in a child's risk of developing the condition. Since 2011, the Department of Health has prevented the use of Pandemrix in people under the age of 20.","Josh Hadfield fell ill within three weeks of having the Pandemrix jab .

"The £4billion Premier League TV rights tender goes into a second round on Tuesday morning with revised bids due by midday. The seven packages are expected to be awarded later in the day. Although the Discovery Channel and beIN Sport have shown interest, the most likely scenario is that Sky will retain four prime packages. BT, meanwhile, will get an increased number of games, up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season for three years. Competition from Discovery Communications and beIN Sports could the push price per match to £8m . Overall, the likely cost will be around £8m per game. However, Sky retaining the 4pm Sunday slot package, which has the most first picks attached to it, will allow them to dominate the choice of games as they have done since the start of the Barclays Premier League. The bids were tabled for the seven packages - starting in 2016-17 - by a noon deadline on Friday, but there was no immediate verdict from the Premier League, as there was a week earlier for the highlights rights won by BBC. Sky have brought Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (right) into their star studded line-up of pundits . BT Sport will get an increased number of games, up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season . Who will be bidding in the auction for domestic live rights to the Premier League? Sky and BT, who currently share coverage, will both be involved again. They paid £3.018billion between them for the 2013-16 rights. That is expected to rise for 2016-19, and potentially soar to £4bn if other serious bidders enter the auction, such as US-based giant Discovery Communications and Qatar-owned beIN Sports. Will Sky lose matches this time? It’s feasible. Under the current deals, Sky have 116 live games per season, and BT have the other 38 games, for a total of 154 live games per season, which were sold in seven packages. The auction for 2016-19 also has seven packages for sale but more games overall. Five packages have 28 games per season and two packages have 14 games. About a dozen of the extra games will be shown on Friday nights. Sky has dominated the showing of live games since the inception of the Premier League in 1992 . Any one broadcaster will be allowed a maximum of 126 games per season — or four ‘big’ packages plus one ‘small’ package. That’s what Sky currently has and will want to keep. They will almost certainly be willing to pay more than the £2.28bn over three years they paid last time. But will another major player splash the cash and reduce what Sky have? BT have deep pockets. They spent £897m on Champions League and Europa League live rights for three seasons starting 2015-16. They won’t want less than the 38 PL games they have now and can be expected to bid strongly. The real unknown is whether Discovery and beIN Sports will come in with blockbuster bids. That could blow the market open and send prices soaring, again. Who are Discovery Communications and what personalities might we see on our TVs if a new bidder wins the rights to Premier League matches? Discovery are a US-based global media company that started in the 1980s with one documentary channel. They are now extremely wealthy and own a majority stake in Eurosport. Their chief executive was reportedly in London last month to meet Premier League officials for talks about a bid for UK rights. If Discovery win the rights to some matches the assumption is they would show them on British Eurosport, which has never televised live Premier League games. They would try to hire or poach established names, possibly from Sky or BT if those two lose games. beIN Sports already have former Sky frontmen Richard Keys and Andy Gray working for them in Qatar. beIN Sports have already recruited former Sky presenter and pundit Andy Gray (left) Why is there such fierce competition for Premier League games? A generation ago virtually nobody in Britain paid to watch TV over and above their licence fee. Now around 60 per cent of households (or 16m homes) pay for a subscription whether Sky, Virgin or BT. Increasingly, the battle between these communications giants is for the ‘triple play’ market (phone, internet and TV from one source) and the ‘quad play’ market (which adds mobile phones). They want you to get all your services from them. Live Premier League matches are being used in an attempt to influence your choice. With millions of people paying £600-plus a year for these services, it’s a massive industry. If another broadcaster enters the arena, TV fans may find they have to pay for another subscription . Will Premier League football cost me more from 2016-17? Will I need more subscriptions? It’s feasible that Sky and BT will share the rights again in broadly the same way they do now, and fans won’t notice any difference to pricing. But if a third or even fourth broadcaster gets involved more subscriptions will be needed, almost certainly at extra cost. Although if Sky lose a lot of games they may have to reduce prices to keep customers. Will the clubs get richer? Oh yes. The total broadcasting pot for the 2013-16 period was more than £5.5bn, mostly from domestic live rights (£3.018bn) and foreign rights (£2.23bn) with highlights, near-live rights and mobile rights on top. The 2016-19 total pot is expected to be close to £7bn with £4bn from domestic rights. The vast bulk of the cash will end up being split among the Premier League clubs. Premier League clubs like leaders Chelsea will get even richer following the new TV deal . Premier League fans are not expected to see a reduction in ticket prices following the sale . Will ticket prices go down? You’re having a laugh, aren’t you? Almost certainly not and not by much in any case. Many Premier League games are sold out or nearly sold out, even though ticket prices are the most expensive in the world. While the demand is there, clubs will charge what they can. The only rider to that is that the Premier League hierarchy would like to see clubs offer more cheap deals, particularly to away fans and younger people. It remains possible that an increase in TV money will allow more subsidies for schemes like this... but don’t bank on it.","The £3.01bn for 2013-16 rights paid by Sky and BT is expected to rise .

But . the 27-year-old, who boarded at £31,000-a-year Marlborough College . with Princess Eugenie and Kate and Pippa Middleton, certainly seems to . have turned things around – for she was last night named as the new . lover of Sergey Brin, 40. Google has been rocked by talk of the . romance, and a spokesman yesterday confirmed that Brin – one of the . world’s richest men with a £15billion fortune – has for several months . been living apart from his wife of six years Anne Wojcicki, the mother . of his two children. If they divorce, Californian law suggests their . massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly . signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement.

Miss Rosenberg wrote an . online blog soon after she arrived – describing herself as a . ‘misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with Californian . optimism’. She wrote: ‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed . life in London for pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, . life. Then one day I realised the beauty had faded. ‘So I applied for a transfer with my company to a different country. Yes!

The website jibes: ‘Since Google Glass launched the company’s co-founder, Sergey Brin, hasn’t been spotted without a pair. 'He’s placed himself atop the privacy-eroding project, publicly, and inside Google’s secret labs. 'Maybe it’s because he’s f****** the Glass marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg.’ The blog goes on: ‘Knowing that one of the most vital, powerful men at the company has been using Google’s most ambitious product as a dating pool won’t be smooth news for the rest of the team.’ She also wrote that she was initially so . shy she failed to turn up at her first work drinks invitation, fearing . she would be ‘the weird loner in the corner’, so stayed in eating . biscuits alone on her sofa instead. In an internet profile Miss . Rosenberg wrote of herself: ‘I’m part of the master race that is the . Chinese Jew or Chew, if you will. 'Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK.

"Executed: Ohio's lethal injection procedures are being reviewed following the prolonged execution of death row inmate Dennis McGuire (pictured) in January . Ohio executions have been put on hold after a federal judge allowed more time for arguments over the state's new lethal injection procedures. The order, in place until August 15, delays executions scheduled for July and August while attorneys prepare filings about the state's decision to boost the dosages of its lethal injection drugs. The procedure update follows the January 16 . execution of Dennis McGuire, who repeatedly gasped before suffering a massive heart attack during the record 26 . minutes it took him to die. The disturbing description of McGuire's death prompted international condemnation of the already controversial practice. The one-page order by Columbus federal judge Gregory Frost on Tuesday affects the state's latest death penalty policy change, which was announced in late April. Ohio uses two drugs injected simultaneously in executions. The policy change considerably increases the amount of the sedative and raises the amount of the painkiller. The state said in April it was making the changes 'to allay any remaining concerns' after McGuire's execution, though it stood by the way he was put to death. The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said its review of McGuire's execution determined he was asleep and unconscious a few minutes after the drugs were administered and his execution was conducted in a constitutional manner. 'He did not experience pain, distress or air hunger after the drugs were administered or when the bodily movements and sounds occurred,' the state said. Scroll down for video . Punishment: The execution chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville where Dennis McGuire was put to death in January . Frost's order delays the July 2 execution of Ronald Phillips, sentenced to die for the rape and death of Sheila Marie Evans, his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter, in Akron in 1993. It's the second delay for Phillips, whose execution last fall was postponed while he unsuccessfully requested to donate organs to family members. The order also delays the August 6 execution of William Montgomery, who shot 20-year-old Debra Ogle and her 19-year-old roommate Cynthia Tincher in 1986. Messages were left for attorneys for Phillips and Montgomery. The attorney general's office said it would follow the judge's order, said spokeswoman Lisa Hackley.

"Chris Robshaw has been endorsed as the man to captain England at the World Cup, days after leading a tunnel stand-off in Cardiff which set the defiant tone for his side's heroic victory. The Harlequins flanker has been the established skipper throughout Stuart Lancaster's three-year tenure, but he has always had to earn the right to retain the job on a tournament-by-tournament basis. Now, however, the national coach has made an unprecedented declaration of long-term faith in Robshaw's capacity to fulfil the role. Lancaster's instinct is to avoid nailing his colours to the mast but he said: 'Players get injured and things happen that are out of your control. But it would take a big change of heart now to move from the direction we're going with Chris. Chris Robshaw (centre) passes to tighthead Kieran Brookes during England training at Pennyhill Park .

Lancaster (right) issues instructions to his players as they prepare for Saturday's game against Italy . Saracens lock George Kruis (centre) put in an impressive shift against the Welsh pack on Friday night . 'I've got other good players in the back row who are all desperate for an opportunity, but Chris has been excellent and we need to make sure we continue to back him. We certainly will in this Six Nations and, fingers crossed, he'll be fit and available for June.' That suggests only injury can deny Robshaw the honour of leading the host nation into the World Cup, which represents emphatic progress for the 28-year-old. He has been captain in 32 of the 33 Tests he has played for his country but even as recently as last June, at the end of England's trip to New Zealand, the coaches were voicing grave misgivings about the openside's breakdown credentials and inviting a challenge from other specialist English No 7s. During the autumn, Robshaw was caught up in the criticism which came England's way after defeats against the All Blacks and South Africa. But he finished the November series with a towering performance in the victory over Australia and then led by example at the Millennium Stadium. England captain Robshaw (left) set the tone for the match with his pre-match stand-off in the tunnel . Lancaster said: 'He's been excellent. Confidence in his ability as a player is the fundamental thing behind leadership. You've got to be secure of your place in the team. He's earned that and he earns it on a weekly basis. 'He did it again against Wales with the number of tackles he made, the turnovers he made and his contribution to the game. We look at people's involvement, not just in the rucks but in their work-rate off the ball. He's continually at the top of that as well. 'He's earned the respect of all the players and as a consequence he's leading them effectively. But he's also got the strength of solidarity from the leaders around him as well. They back him up to the hilt.' In the moments before kick-off last Friday, Robshaw illustrated his increasing authority by resolutely refusing to lead his team down the tunnel until receiving assurances that Wales would not keep them waiting in the cold for long. It was a stance which infuriated the hosts and set a bloody-minded tone for what was to follow. James Haskell (left), Robshaw (centre) and Billy Vunipola worked brilliantly as a backrow triumvirate .

Lancaster attempted to down-play the significance of that stand-off but asked if his skipper would have done the same thing before the RBS 6 Nations opener at Murrayfield in 2012, he said: 'It wouldn't have been a decision I'd have encouraged him to make in what was my first game in charge.

"A train-obsessive has achieved a life's ambition by visiting every station on the New York subway system in less than a day - setting a new world record in the process. Glen Bryant of Emsworth in Hampshire achieved his feat by visiting the 468 stops that make up the Big Apple's underground network in an impressive 22 hours, 26 minutes and two seconds. Quite the journey: The New York subway system is one of the biggest in the world, with 468 stations . A pharmacist by profession, Mr Bryant, 26, travelled to New York with five other enthusiasts, starting his epic journey at 3am, and finishing at 1am the following day. His jaunt has been recognised as a Guinness World Record. The trick to managing this herculean task, he says, was team work. 'It's easier to do the challenge in a group because you have one person doing the photographs and one person doing the log book,' he explains. 'For me, the job was making sure we passed through every station, and [deciding] what line we were taking next. Enthusiast: Glen Bryant achieved his feat in 22 hours, 26 minutes and two seconds . 'We would stop, the doors would open and we would take the photograph. 'You don't have to physically step on the platform. 'There are times when it has gone wrong with delays, lines being closed and broken down trains. 'But overall we had some good luck. 'We were up for 26 hours and if it wasn't for my teammates, I probably would have fallen asleep.' 'There was no celebration at the end. It was more like ""Can we go to bed now?""' This swift dash around America's most famous city eclipsed the previous record by almost half an hour. In 2009, Chris Solarz and Matt Ferrisi, both from New York, completed the challenge in 22 hours and 52 minutes. Odyssey: Mr Bryant's journey took him to all corners of the network - including stations in Queens . Before tackling this marker, Mr Bryant also took on a solo challenge to visit all 270 stations on the London Underground in the quickest time possible. He decided to take up the challenge after becoming interested in the London Underground and discovering the record for visiting all the stations on Wikipedia. Despite attempting the challenge 14 times, Mr Bryant was always pipped to the post and fell short of the record by just one hour - coming in at 17 hours and 29 minutes. However, he has had more success on the other side of the Atlantic. His New York time has now been ratified as a record, complete with certificate - although he had to wait for his achievement to be confirmed. 'It took six months to find out we had actually got the record so it was a nerve-wrecking wait. 'Now it's official, it's quite amazing.'","Glen Bryant covers entire New York subway network in just over 22 hours .

"David Cameron today insisted he and other democratically-elected leaders should pick who gets the top EU jobs - as he went boating with German leader Angela Merkel and other EU leaders at a lakeside summit in Sweden. The Prime Minister was pictured at the back of a rowing boat at the Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt's summer home in Harpsund 120km west of Stockholm. The summit came after London Mayor Boris Johnson mocked Mr Cameron's bid to block former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Junker getting the EU's top job. He said it was the ‘quintessence of turd-polishing pointlessness’. David Cameron was joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (second left), Swedish premier Fredrik Reinfeldt (centre) and Dutch PM Mark Rutte (right) in a rowing boat  in Harpsund today . The four leaders are holding talks  on the EU following the rise of the eurosceptic far right in the European Parliament. Mrs Merkel and Mr Cameron are at odds over the appointment of the next European Commission President . In an extraordinary tirade against the Prime Minister’s European strategy, Mr Johnson insisted it made no difference who held key European jobs because it will still wield excessive power over Britain. The London Mayor claimed vetoing Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker is like ‘trying to swat a fly on the leg of the rhino that is standing on your chest’. Mr Junker had been the favourite to succeed José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission, with the backing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mr Cameron fears the pro-European would scupper his attempts to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU. The Prime Minister wants to see more women in senior roles in Brussels and more political balance. He held talks with Mrs Merkel, Holland's Mark Rutte and the Mr Reinfeldt today, where tradition dictates they all take a trip together in the host’s rowing boat. Number 10 stressed that the talks will focus on wider economic reforms, but divisions remain over who should have the Commission presidency. But as he arrived at the summit, Mr Cameron said: 'As the democratically-elected leaders of Europe, we should be the ones to choose who should run these institutions rather than accept some new process which was never agreed. I think that is important.' However, Mr Johnson today mocked the idea of Mr Cameron vetoing Mr Juncker, adding: ‘Here it comes! With a nape-tingling drumroll the national Excalibur is being loosened from the scabbard. ‘The almighty British veto is about to be unleashed after years of cobwebbed desuetude.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson said David Cameron's attempt to block the new head of the European Commission was like 'trying to swat a fly on the leg of the rhino that is standing on your chest' Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson said wielding the veto is ‘a pleasurable and no doubt justifiable but basically futile thing to do’. He argued that the Brussels machine is too big and powerful for the change of personnel at the top to make any meaningful difference. In addition to Mr Juncker, others in the running include Frenchman Pascal Lamy, who used to run the World Trade Organisation and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. But Mr Johnson said: ‘It doesn’t matter whether you have a Bofferding-quaffing Luxembourger or a dynamic French énarque or a Borgen-esque Scandiwegian or a statue of the Mannekin Pis as president of the EU commission.’ Instead, the EU must be ‘boiled down’ to the single market or Britain should leave altogether. More and more power is being held by Brussels, to the fury of voters who find that major decisions are no longer taken by the UK government, Mr Johnson added. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte (left), German Chancellor Angela Merkel (second left), Swedish Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt (second right) and Mr Cameron head in for talks after posing for photographers in front of the summer residence of the Swedish Prime Minister in Harpsund . Sweden's centre-right Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt (right) is a close ally of Mr Cameron's. He had been put forward as a potential future EU Commission President but has vowed to fight the next election in Sweden . ‘In the meantime I suppose we can gratify our irritation by vetoing poor old Juncker – who always struck me as rather a nice chap. ‘But it is the quintessence of turd-polishing pointlessness. 'It is like trying to swat a fly on the leg of the rhino that is standing on your chest. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a cochon.’ IMF chief Christine Lagarde has ruled herself out of the race to run the Commission, insisting she is not a candidate. Labour today announced it backed Mr Cameron's attempt to block Mr Junker from getting the EU's top job. A Labour spokesman said: 'The nominee for European Commission president is ultimately a decision for the European Council, including David Cameron. 'Labour will not support Jean-Claude Juncker as a candidate for president of the European Commission. Should Mr Juncker be put before the European Parliament, Labour MEPs would vote against him. 'The message from the European elections was clear - that we need reform in Europe. We need reform so we can promote jobs and growth. 'Mr Juncker's record shows he would make these reforms more difficult.' Angela Merkel is pushing for arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker (left) to become the new EC president, but IMF chief Christine Lagarde (second left) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by David Cameron. Other politicians in line for Europe's most powerful position include Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny . Jean-Claude Juncker is still the favourite to become the new European Commission President - replacing the outgoing former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso. The former Luxembourg prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the European Parliament's main conservative group, the European People's Party. The EPP emerged from last week's elections with the most seats - leaving Mr Junker in poll position for the EU's most powerful job. But the Commission President is chosen by European leaders including David Cameron - and not by the Parliament. MEPs do however have to confirm the leaders' choice for the job in a vote. The other candidates for the top EU job include the IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Miss Lagarde was finance minister under former President Nicolas Sarkozy before moving to the IMF at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Her term runs until 2016. A fluent English-speaker who headed a major US law firm before holding ministerial office in France, she is highly regarded by German leader Angela Merkel. Center-left Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is also under consideration. The former MEP is the daughter-in-law of Neil Kinnock, the ex Labour leader and European commissioner. If Mrs Merkel was open to a French candidate for one of the top jobs, Paris might offer Socialist former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault - a fluent German-speaker who was replaced in March but is well regarded in Berlin. Another candidate for the EU Commission President is the current Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The Fine Gael leader became Ireland's leader in 2011, so might be open to moving to Brussels.","Cameron joins Merkel, Dutch PM Rutte and Sweden's Reinfeldt at summit .

"Amnesty's latest policy goes against its ethos of protecting those who suffer from abuse, the writer says (picture posed by model) Since its foundation more than 50 years ago, Amnesty International has gained a formidable reputation as a global campaigner against oppression. To people living under authoritarian rule, the organisation has rightly come to be seen as a symbol of hope and a force for freedom. As a left-leaning feminist, I have strongly supported Amnesty’s efforts to promote the human rights of women around the world. But it is precisely because of this admiration that I am so dismayed by this new initiative, which runs counter to its entire ethos as a bulwark for people suffering abuse, exploitation and maltreatment. The call for the decriminalisation of prostitution or what it describes, with offensive understatement, as the ‘sex work’ industry is dressed up in soothing, politically correct rhetoric about women’s rights. But the reality is that legalisation would represent official state approval of those who keep this vile trade going. The astonishing proposal shows absolutely no understanding of the dark, misogynistic world of prostitution, where coercion is rife and brutality endemic. Amnesty tries to pretend that women selling their bodies is similar to other forms of labour – with one passage in the document explicitly drawing a parallel between women who ‘choose to become sex workers’ and ‘miners and domestic foreign workers’. Having researched prostitution, one woman who I interviewed described her life of seeing at least ten male customers a day as ‘a form of torture’. That is just the sort of injustice that Amnesty is meant to be fighting. Yet Amnesty, in an abject inversion of its ethical values, has somehow persuaded itself that surrender to money-driven, masculine sexual aggression represents progress towards liberty. Far from representing any form of advancement for women, the decriminalisation of prostitution would lead to more abuse, more violence, more subjugation. This was made clear in Australia where legalisation of the brothel industry in one state resulted in a fourfold increase in the number of trafficked women working in legal brothels. In a dreadful euphemism, Amnesty admits that ‘the context’ of the sex work industry is ‘imperfect’. ‘Imperfect’ is one way of describing a trade built on physical abuse, rape, child sex abuse, sadism and greed. It is highly offensive of Amnesty to pretend that this is similar to other industries. In what other job do the occupational hazards include beatings, theft of earnings, sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, forcible removal of children, constant threats and even death? In fact, there can be few more dangerous activities for women. It is telling that many of Britain’s worst serial killers, like the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe or the Ipswich killer Steven Wright, regularly visited prostitutes. Tania Nicol, 19, was one of the women killed by Steve Wright in Ipswich . In the same self-deceiving vein, Amnesty claims it will not support decriminalisation of prostitution where violence or coercion are involved. But that is just more confused thinking. Intimidation is at the very core of this world. Very few women end up selling sex through their own free choice. Trafficking, menaces, drug addiction and financial pressures all play their part. Recent research has shown that 67 per cent of prostitutes have suffered violence in childhood, 61 per cent had experienced violence from ‘clients’ and 74 per cent had endured mental and physical health problems as a result of their involvement with this trade. Absurdly, Amnesty seems even to have accepted the notion that paying for sexual services is a basic human right for men. By definition, men who are willing to pay for sex already have a contemptuous attitude towards women – they are not interested in an equal relationship, or a meaningful exchange with a partner. Instead of proposing legalisation, Amnesty International should concentrate on freeing women from the clutches of these men. The end of prostitution might be a distant ideal, but it is still far better than Amnesty’s grubby collusion with misogyny.","Amnesty is known for efforts to promote human rights, says writer .

"The secretive nation of North Korea had given away the status of its nuclear arms program months before its controversial leader, Kim Jong Un, openly declared he would order nuclear strikes, it was revealed today. Newsweek/Daily Beast today exclusively revealed that the country, known as much for its nuclear weapons as for its propaganda, had the resources to launch a nuclear attack in December. Part of a rocket launched by North Korea in December was recovered by U.S. officials, who then determined the true threat the nation posed. The debris provided valuable insight into what had been happening beyond the De-militarized Zone in the capital of Pyongyang. Hat tip: The U.S. Navy recovered debris from a rocket launched by North Korea on a Navy ship at Navy's 2nd Fleet headquarters in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, in December . Lookout: A South Korean navy sailor stands guard near a part of debris from a rocket launched by North Korea; the debris alerted U.S. officials over the country's ability to launch a nuclear attack . Recovery: Korean navy sailors carried the debris from a rocket launched by North Korea, in the Yellow Sea, off Gunsan, to shore . Sources told the website that members of . the U.S. Navy recovered what was assumedly a fuel container last . December, and revealed how exactly a nuclear missile could be deployed. The discarded rocket revealed much about North Korea’s capacity to launch a nuclear attack. ‘We looked at the wreckage from the launch, and we put it together with other kinds of intelligence and came to this judgement that they had figured out the warhead piece,’ a non-proliferation official told the Daily Beast. The officials’ confirmation coincides with a bungled report from the Pentagon that was mistakenly released earlier this month after marked ‘unclassified.’ The papers detailed that they have ‘moderate confidence’ that Pyongyang is able to launch ballistic missiles armed with nuclear weapons . In the report, a Pentagon agency concluded for the first time that the secretive country could have a likely ability to launch a nuclear-armed missile at its enemies, although this was later played down by the Obama administration. Safeguarding: Tourists take photos of the US Navy ship, the 'USS Peleliu', docked at Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui, in Hong Kong today as a show of force against North Korea . The document, called ‘Dynamic Threat Assessment 8099: North Korea Nuclear Weapons Program,’ is from March of 2013. However, shortly after its release by Rep. Dough Lamborn, R-Colorado, Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement that there was little reason to be immediately alarmed. ‘It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed, or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in this passage,’ the statement reads. The armed thousands: Last week, North Koreans held a rally to gather their willingness for a victory in a possible war against the United States and South Korea in Nampo, North Korea (file photo) Response: Anti-North Korean protesters from conservative, right-wing and pro-U.S. civic groups, burn an effigy of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during a protest in central Seoul April 15 . ‘The United States continues to closely monitor the North Korean nuclear program and calls upon North Korea to honor its international obligations.’ While the rest of the world hears whispers and rumors of nuclear demise, North Koreans themselves today set aside their fear-mongering and bravado to celebrate the birthday of their first leader, Kim Il Sung. Girls in red and pink jackets skipped along streets of the capital of Pyongyang, festooned with celebratory banners and flags and boys on inline skates took a break to slurp up bowls of shaved ice. There was no sense of panic in the North Korean capital, where very few locals have access to international broadcasts and foreign newspapers speculating about an imminent missile launch and detailing the international diplomacy under way to try to rein Pyongyang in. Cause for celebration: Workers visit the plaza park of Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, to commemorate the 101st anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founder Kim Il-sung . Hands together: Audience members applaud during an outdoor performance at the Third April Spring People's Art Festival in Pyongyang today . Elsewhere in the region, however, the focus remained on the threat of a launch as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wrapped up a tour to coordinate Washington's response with Beijing, North Korea's most important ally, as well as with Seoul and Tokyo. In Seoul, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told a parliamentary committee Monday that North Korea still appeared poised to launch a missile from its east coast, though he declined to disclose the source of his information. Kerry warned North Korea not to conduct a missile test, saying it would be provocation that 'will raise people's temperatures' and further isolate the country and its impoverished people. He said Sunday that the U.S. was 'prepared to reach out,' but that Pyongyang must first bring down tensions and honor previous agreements.","Three North Korean non-proliferation officials said that the secretive country tipped off U.S. officials after members of the American Navy found part of a rocket in December .

"It is a moment that every parent remembers and wants to cherish for the rest of their life. But one father was forced to use Skype to get a glimpse of his newborn twins - because he was paralysed in another hospital more than 130 miles away. William Jones, 31, missed the birth of his baby girls after a freak cycling accident left him with a broken back just weeks before the twins were due. Mr Jones, of Plympton, Devon, had to spend 13 weeks in hospital and has been left wheelchair-bound. Doctors have warned he will probably never walk again. William Jones, 31, was paralysed in a freak cycling accident just weeks before the birth of his twin daughters Alodie and Elizabeth. His wife, Kate, 29, said: 'It was difficult. He woke up and said he couldn't feel his legs. They pretty much said he wouldn't be able to walk again' Mr Jones caught his first glimpse of his daughters via Skype - because he was in a hospital 130 miles away. He met them for the first time in November, three weeks after they were born on 18th October . Mr Jones had been cycling home from work when the accident happened. He said: 'I don't remember it but the police report said it was a freak accident with no other vehicles involved.' He broke his back, fractured his ribs, and punctured his lung in three places. He is pictured before the accident . The father-of-two, who worked for a bike company, was cycling home from work on September 16 last year when the accident happened. He said: 'I don't remember it but the police report said it was a freak accident with no other vehicles involved. 'I dislocated my spine, fractured four ribs and had three punctures in my lung.' He underwent a 10-hour operation at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, while his wife, who was then 33 weeks pregnant, waited anxiously. He spent three weeks in intensive care before being transferred to The Duke of Cornwall Spinal Treatment Centre, in Salisbury, for 10 weeks - days before the twins were due. His wife Kate, whom he married  in July 2013, said: 'It was difficult. He woke up and said he couldn't feel his legs. They pretty much said he wouldn't be able to walk again.' Mr Jones is now living nearly 10 miles away from his Kate, 29, and daughters Alodie and Elizabeth, four months, as there are no suitable homes for them. He is forced to live in a facility for over 60s, because he can't get into his own Plympton home with his wheelchair. Mr Jones is now living 10 miles away from his daughters, now four months, as there are no suitable homes for the family, in a situation he calls 'disgusting'. 'I'm missing out on my children growing up,' he said . Hospice worker Kate has stayed in the family's privately rented home. Despite the family being on the housing list, they can't find anywhere to live. The couple described the housing situation as 'disgusting'. Mr Jones said: 'To say that the later part of the year was traumatic is an understatement.' 'We just want to be together and begin our new lives as a family and move on from this horrific injury that has changed all our lives forever. 'I'm missing out on my children growing up and I'm also not able to support my poor wife at a time she needs it most.' 'Kate and I kept in good contact throughout her pregnancy. She went really quiet one morning and four hours later or so she texted me something along the lines of ""you're a daddy now"". Kate Jones says she wants to go back to work and to start campaigning to make sure there is adequate housing for people who are disabled. Mr Jones is also hoping to get back on his bike and try 'arm cycling' 'We then Skyped as soon as we could. The whole family are all amazing. They are what's given me the inspiration to get better. 'But it's such a problem that we haven't been housed. We haven't had the chance to be a young family and there does not seem to be anything we can do. It is really, really bad. 'We can't afford a deposit for a house and every house that comes up seems to go to other people. 'We've tried going private but landlords don't want to change their houses even though we can get a £25,000 grant. 'I'm really hoping I can go back to work and I want to start campaigning to make sure there are enough properties available for those who are disabled.'

"At least two music fans have been killed and 23 injured after a suspected drunken driver fleeing police crashed through barricades at the South By Southwest festival in Austin in the early hours of Thursday morning. Police in Austin, Texas, say the motor crashed through temporary barricades that were set up for the festival and into the throng of people at around 12.30am killing a man on a bicycle and a woman on a moped.

"New research has found that more than half of Britain's most popular rice products - including Kellogg's Rice Krispies and Smooth Baby Rice by Heinz  - exceed proposed new EU limits for arsenic. While there are low levels of arsenic in most food and water, researchers are now concerned that arsenic can reach much higher levels in rice. Channel 4's Dispatches, Rice: How Safe is our Food? which will be broadcast on Monday night, tested 81 different products with the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen's University Belfast. Tests have shown 58 per cent of rice products have exceeded proposed European Union recommended limits for arsenic in children's products, which are expected to come into force next summer . They discovered 58 per cent exceeded proposed European Union recommended limits for children, which are expected to come into force next summer. Although there are strict limits for the amount of arsenic level allowed in water, there are currently no maximum levels in food - and now some scientists are speaking out as they are concerned about the effects of long-term exposure. As more evidence emerges about the harm high levels of arsenic might cause, particularly to children, new maximum levels have been proposed by the European Union with the support of the Food Standards Agency. The proposed new EU recommendations will limit 200 parts of arsenic per billion for adults and just 100 ppb for children and babies. During the research products including Kelloggs' Rice Krispies and Kallo organic puffed rice cereal were tested multiple times - and some showed high levels of inorganic arsenic, far above the proposed limits. Organic original puffed rice cereal by Kallo Foods was found to have 323 parts of arsenic per billion (ppb) while Organic wholegrain baby rice by Organix was found to have 268 ppb  – 168 per cent above recommended levels for babies and children. Rice Krispies by Kelloggs were found to have 188 ppb, far above the recommended levels for babies and children. Baby organic rice cakes by Boots were found to be 162 ppb, and Organic wholegrain banana porridge by Organix at 142 ppb. These graphs show how much inorganic arsenic the rice products have in them by % above the proposed limits . The graphs show that of these eight products which were tested, the highest levels of inorganic arsenic are found in Organix Organic Wholegrain Baby Rice and Biona Rice Cakes with Quinoa . Smooth Baby Rice by Heinz was found to be 129 ppb– 28.9 per cent above recommended levels for babies and children . Under the proposed new EU rules manufacturers may have to reformulate their recipes or risk having to remove them from shops. While not harmful in small quantities to humans, scientists say exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic over a prolonged period can lead to cancer or heart disease. Professor Andrew Meharg, Professor of Biological Sciences at Queen's University Belfast, told Dispatches: 'The European Union is going to set standards for arsenic levels in baby rice at 100 parts per billion. To my estimation that is far too high. It should be at least half that. 'The limits are set so as not to disrupt the rice trade rather than on the risk to human health.' People in Britain consume five times the amount of rice they did 40 years ago. While it is rich in vitamins, fibre and protein, it is also the only common food item with high levels of arsenic. The levels of arsenic in rice  vary by type. Italian brown rice has 160ppb, red rice from France 310ppb and basmati rice from India has just 40ppb. Dr Diane Benford of the FSA told the Channel 4 programme: 'The risks are related to long-term exposure to arsenic. We are taking action to reduce that exposure.' She added: 'Parents should not worry. There are no immediate risks.' The Rice Association, which represents the rice industry in the UK said  it 'welcomes' the initiative to establish new arsenic limits in rice. A spokesman said: 'We can be confident there is no health risk associated with regular consumption of rice purchased in the UK.' Boots, Organix and Kelloggs told Dispatches they take the safety of their products seriously. Boots said they will continue to work closely with suppliers and regulatory experts to ensure their baby food is safe and fully complies with any future regulations. Organix told the programme they test their foods rigorously and parents should have no cause for concern, and added:  ‘We welcome proposals for further regulation and we would meet future legislative changes.’ Kellogg's said their cereals are not in the category of foods for infants and young children, and said it's a complex issue and a number of proposed limits are on the table. A Kelloggs spokesman said: 'The testing we have done shows that the levels are within the limits of the most up to date proposals we have seen. We will continue to work with government agencies, scientists, academics and others in the food industry at a global level to review the data on this topic.'","Experts warn some popular rice products contain high levels of arsenic .

"While Britain was closing railways and stations in 1964, Japan was changing the world of rail travel and launching its 130mph bullet-train which celebrated its 50 birthday today. And while the UK's railway network continues to chug along and the £50 billion, 330-mile HS2 line project inches forward, Japan's Shinkansen has continued to speed ahead. While its top speed was initially 130mph, it now races between Tokyo and Osaka at 186mph, the same speed as the Eurostar - which runs between London and Folkstone. Scroll down for video . Japan's 186mph bullet-train, known as the Shinkansen, today celebrated its 50 birthday . The 1964 opening of the bullet train which was re-enacted in Tokyo today complete with ribbon cutting . Retired Japanese railway engineer Fumihiro Araki recalls being on the Shinkansen was 'like flying in the sky', and how the train became a symbol of pride for Japan . Japan's first bullet train, with its almost cute bulbous round nose, completed the trip between the two cities in four hours, shaving two and a half hours off the 319 mile journey. The latest model, with a space-age-like elongated nose, takes just two hours and 25 minutes. The October 1, 1964, inauguration ceremony was re-enacted at Tokyo Station today at 6am complete with ribbon cutting. Retired Japanese railway engineer Fumihiro Araki recalls being on the Shinkansen was 'like flying in the sky', and how the train became a symbol of pride for Japan. Mr Araki, now 73, drove the Shinkansen briefly in the summer of 1967 as part of his training as a railway operations engineer. While its top speed was initially 130mph, it now races between Tokyo and Osaka at 186mph . The successive models of the Shinkansen bullet train, (L to R) E3 Komachi, E3 Tsubasa, E1 Max, 200, E6, E5 and E4 Max are displayed at JR East's Oyama Shinkansen Train Center . Mr Araki, pictured sitting in the driver's seat of the early model bullet trains at a railway museum, drove the Shinkansen briefly in the summer of 1967 as part of his training as a railway operations engineer . Japan started building a high-speed line during the Second World War, but construction was halted in 1943, before it was completed  in time for the Tokyo Olympics in October 1964 . Last week, he slipped back in time as he sat in the driver's seat of one of the early model bullet trains at a railway museum outside of Tokyo. He pulled a lever on the control panel, looking straight ahead as he was trained, though all he could see were other museum exhibits. Mr Araki recalled: 'It was like flying in the sky, it was that kind of feeling. 'On a clear day, you could see Mount Fuji, and riding atop the railway bridge at Hamanako lake was very pleasant. It felt like you were sailing above the sea.' Japan started building a high-speed line during the Second World War, but construction was halted in 1943 as funds ran out. The idea was revived in the 1950s and the project was completed in time for the Tokyo Olympics in October 1964. The Shinkansen renewed interest in high-speed rail across the world, notably in Europe. France and Spain are among the leaders, and Turkey last year became the ninth country to operate a train at an average speed of 124mph.","The bullet train was completed in time for the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 .

"Harry Jones, 20, was found dead in Blackpool, Lancashire last January after taking a concoction of Tramadol painkillers, Valium and alcohol . A babysitter who was addicted to painkillers died in his sleep after taking a concoction of Valium, Tramadol pain relief and alcohol at a notorious drug house, an inquest heard. Harry Jones, 20, was found dead on the sofa of Sharon Nuttall’s home in Blackpool, Lancashire, after spending the night babysitting her two young children. An inquest heard the college student, who was an aspiring film producer, was given the Valium by drug dealer Nuttall on the evening of January 13 in last year, but secretly took the Tramadol painkillers after swiping them from her collection while she was out partying. He was found unconscious the following morning by friends and pronounced dead after attempts to resuscitate him failed. A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure at the hearing in Blackpool yesterday, and said it was clear Mr Jones had voluntarily taken the alcohol and medication but hadn’t intended to die as a result. The inquest came just over a year after mother-of-four Nuttall was sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. The 41-year-old, whose children at the time were five, seven, 10 and 15, turned her family home into a ‘magnet’ for young people by using it as a drugs den to sell amphetamines, cannabis, prescription drugs and the former legal high ‘bubble’. Over a three-year period, she allowed up to 20 youngsters into her home at once to take drugs - often introducing them to new tablets and dangerous concoctions. Following yesterday’s inquest, Mr Jones’ mother, Lorraine, 48, condemned Nuttall for introducing youngsters in the area to drugs and making them so readily available. The bank worker, from Blackpool, said: ‘There are so many kids’ lives that she ruined from what she was doing. ‘She wasn’t charged directly with Harry’s death but if he had never met her he might not have started on the route he did. Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was an aspiring film producer and was in the process of applying to Leeds University at the time of his death in January last year . Tests revealed Mr Jones (pictured as a child) died as a result of a massive ingestion of Tramadol pain relief, which had been prescribed to Sharon Nuttall by doctors for back pain, plus Diazepam and alcohol . ‘Harry was a good boy but he came across these tablets at her house when he was about 17 and he changed. ‘She was in her 40s with small children and yet she was having 16 and 17-year-olds round her house doing “bubble”. You can’t get your head around how a mother would do something like that.’ Mr Jones, a Grade A media student who attended Blackpool and The Fylde College, was described by his family as ‘the life and soul of parties’. However, the inquest heard how the student, who was in the process of applying to study at Leeds University at the time of his death, had been battling an addiction to painkillers which even saw him tell doctors that he suffered from severe back pain in order to get repeated prescriptions for painkillers. Mrs Jones said: ‘From the end of October 2012 to the time of his death he appeared to be ok. ‘He wasn’t going out and had his head down at college and we had a really great Christmas where he was the life and soul as usual. ‘He was saving up to go on holiday. It was always one week at a time with Harry. He had had a really good couple of months.’ However, on the night of his death, he . went to Nuttall’s house with a friend to babysit her children and, . despite being armed with two bottles of wine, asked her for a Valium . tablet. Mr Jones was babysitting for mother-of-four Sharon Nuttall (pictured) on the night of his death and had taken Tramadol and Valium from her home before mixing the painkillers with alcohol. He was found dead on her sofa . Mother-of-four Nuttall (pictured outside Preston Crown Court in May last year) was sentenced to 18 months in prison for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs . She gave both Mr Jones and his friend a Valium tablet each before leaving the property and later exchanging text messages with them, after they asked her for more tablets. The 17-year-old friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, relayed the course of events in a statement read out at the inquest. It read: ‘Harry came upstairs at about 2.30am and I would describe him as pretty wasted. ‘He told me to get up so I did and went downstairs to watch TV. He was slurring his words and kept talking to himself. ‘He started to root through his pockets and pulled out eight Tramadol with two missing. My friend grabbed them and asked what he was doing with them. ‘He gave them to me and I hid them in the bathroom because I knew he had problems with prescription drugs in the past. At about 4am my friend got up and said he was leaving and I went to sleep. ‘As I left the room Harry was lying . down on his back on the sofa snoring and asleep. At 11am a friend let . himself in as the door was open and woke me up and said “Harry looks . dead”. ‘We both tried to wake him up, shook him and listened to his breathing and then we rang an ambulance.’ Tests revealed Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken a small amount of Valium. But the level of Tramadol in his system was 'within a range associated with fatalities' Mr Jones (pictured on a family holiday) was described by his family and friends as the 'life and soul of parties' Tests revealed Mr Jones died as a result of a massive ingestion of Tramadol pain relief, which had been prescribed to Nuttall by doctors for back pain, plus Diazepam and alcohol. In a statement Nuttall said Mr Jones was a ‘good friend’ who she had known since he was 14. She said that two months before his death she had gone to take Tramadol for her back pain but found they were missing. She confronted him and he admitted taking the medication but apologised. Speaking about the evening before his death, she said: ‘We all had a drink. At about 11.35pm I went to my boyfriend’s and left Harry and his friend watching TV. When I left he had a couple of glasses of wine and was fine. I told him he could stay over. Mother-of-four Sharon Nuttall, 41, was sentenced to 18 months in prison last May for supplying Class B and C drugs and permitting her house to be used for smoking and supplying drugs. At the time, the judge Mr Recorder Stephen Bedford at Preston Crown Court, said: ‘Your house became something of a magnet for young vulnerable people you seem to have been unable to keep away. ‘But such was your priority, was your social life over the welfare of young people in your house - particularly your children - that you left the house that night. ‘I’m looking at you being the adult here, you being the parent at home. Allowing them to behave in this way, not just on a one-off but over a period of time. ‘That must have had some corrupting effect upon them.’ A 17-year old boy who helped Nuttall also admitted to being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs last May and was sentenced to a 12-month youth rehabilitation and supervision order. ‘I did not think he had Tramadol when I left but he texted me several times in the early hours asking about it. ‘I was told in the morning he was deceased. I checked my medication and there was some Tramadol missing. I can’t say exactly how many but about 40 to 60. It’s hard to say the exact number.’ A post-mortem revealed that Mr Jones was less than twice the legal drink-drive limit at the time of his death and had taken just a small amount of Valium. But the level of Tramadol in his system was ‘within a range associated with fatalities’ and combined with the other factors meant he would have ‘slept into death’. Coroner Alan Wilson returned a verdict of misadventure and described his death as tragic’. He said: ‘He was the life and soul of parties - opinionated, outgoing, frustrating - but always caring and loved. ‘He was passionate about meteorology and an animal lover. He was working part time in a hotel on weekends and was saving or a holiday with friends. ‘His friends and family are devastated by tragic death and struggle to come to terms with it. 'Everyone who knew him remembers his big smile and he will be sorely missed by all whose lives he shared.’ After the hearing Mr Jones’ father, Darren, 48, paid tribute to his son and said he would’ve excelled in his dream job of being a film producer. The double glazing installer said: ‘At Christmas he had everyone in stitches. He would have been perfect in front of the camera but he was brilliant behind it. ‘He was amazing at everything he turned his hand to.’","Harry Jones died after taking a concoction of Valium, Tramadol and alcohol .

"Dubai is opening a new theme park with a difference - it will be based entirely underwater. The holiday hotspot wants to capitalise on the popularity of scuba-diving and snorkeling by opening the world’s largest underwater tourism site which will be called Pearl Of Dubai. The five acre site, located in the shallow waters off The World Islands development, has been designed to look like an ancient lost city, by teams who were also involved in the Hollywood blockbusters Avatar and Pirates Of The Caribbean. Grand designs: Guests will be able to explore 'ancient ruins' off the coast of Dubai . Guests of all ages will be able to explore the stunning scenes underneath the sea by scuba-diving or just admire from the surface by snorkeling. Los Angeles-based underwater tourism design company Reef Worlds announced the revolutionary plans in a media statement today. It’s hoped the ambitious new project will help Dubai attract new guests from the global £1.8 billion ($3 billion) dive and snorkel market. Dave Taylor, director of development for Reef Worlds, said: ‘The UAE has a unique tourism problem that we address. Unique new Dubai attraction: Stunning artwork released by Reef World today shows guest swimming in magnificent manmade set . Dubai skyline: The popular tourist resort is packed with hotels and attractions but it's now getting an underwater theme park too .

Taylor continued: ‘The Reef Worlds brand is all about sustainability and the creation of new habitat while at the same time adding instant tourism revenue and excitement to waterfront resorts. ‘We will work with carefully selected resort partners on unique underwater habitat projects that directly support our clients’ sustainability and revenue goals.’ An opening date has yet to be announced.","Guests can explore the Pearl Of Dubai attraction by scuba-diving and snorkling .

"Going to prison: Vincent Parker, 16, has pleaded guilty to murdering his parents last December . A 'smart' and 'sane' 16-year-old said he beat his parents to death over normal punishments, in court on Wednesday. Tenth-grader Vincent Parker murdered his mother Carol, 57, and father Wayne, 55, in their Norfolk, Virginia home just before Christmas last year. The only-child skipped school to carry out the slayings, which weren't spurned by any particular argument. 'I just remember getting mad,' Parker told the court. 'It's all from my dad. All this stuff like my dad taking away my iPod and stuff.' Parker pleaded guilty to two counts of second degree murder, after a psychological evaluation found him to be both sane and intelligent. He was charged as an adult and will be sentenced in September. Parker carried out the act on December 19, 2013 and left school early while his dad was still at work. He showed up at the family home on the 100 block of Bland Ave, and surprised his mother exiting the upstairs bathroom by dousing her in pepper spray. Parker went on to stab his mother in the eye, and beat her with a crowbar and metal baseball bat 'until she stopped breathing'. A medical examiner noted 25 separate smashes and stabs on Mrs Parker's neck, face and head. When his dad got back from work, Parker beat him with the crowbar and stabbed him multiple times. Scroll down for video . Parker left school early on December 19, and beat his mother Carol (left) to death before his father came home from work. When Wayne Parker (right) arrived at the home, his son beat his with a crowbar and stabbed him several times . Mr Parker was able to call 911 for help, but by the time authorities arrived on the scene it was too late for his wife. Mr Parker was transported to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead, but not before fingering his son as the culprit. Parker initially told police his father was the attacker, but later recounted and admitted to the beatings. Investigators recovered five bloody knives, a baseball bat, and crowbar on the scene. When police arrived on the scene, Parker's mother was already dead. Wayne Parker was later pronounced dead at the hospital . Parker was on the honor roll and had no criminal record before the murders. While he will be sentenced as an adult, the District Attorney is going to ask that at least part of his sentence be served at a juvenile facility. If sentenced with the maximum on both counts, Parker could face decades behind bars. His maternal grandfather Allen Taylor says he has forgiven his grandson and is pulling for a shorter sentence. 'He is a smart young man. He is smart in school. I don’t know what happened,' Mr Taylor told reporters outside court on Wednesday. 'I want him to get some type of counseling. Help him to grow up and to be an understanding man. Be sorry for what he did do. I told him to ask God to forgive him to what he did. Forgiven: Parker's grandfather Allen Taylor, Carol's father, says he's forgiving his grandson and hopes he gets a shorter sentence and treatment .","Vincent Parker pleaded guilty on Wednesday to murdering his parents Carol and Wayne Parker last December .

"A tourist who died after being thrown from a horse-drawn carriage was forced to travel in a make-shift ambulance pulled by a tractor because the island bans cars. Swiss national Dora Jufer, aged 68, endured close to a two-hour journey by land and sea to reach the nearest hospital in Guernsey, where she later died. Seven . other tourists and the driver of the carriage were also treated . for injuries, including one male with serious head injuries, following . the incident at around 12.15pm yesterday. The casualties endured a 25 minute journey in a marine ambulance before arriving at Guernsey, pictured, where they were taken to a hospital . The injured woman endured a journey in this trailor ambulance pulled by a tractor to the island's port before being transferred by sea to the nearest hospital in Guernsey . The nine causalities were initially treated by the island's only doctor, Peter Counsell, who transported them to the port in the far from modern ambulance. Guernsey's St John Ambulance and Rescue team travelled by marine ambulance to the island from its neighbour Guernsey, reaching the port close to an hour later. Ms Jufer was treated on board by paramedics during the 25 minute sea journey, arriving at Princess Elizabeth Hospital just before 2pm. She later died there, after suffering serious head injuries. A second male tourist is also being treated for serious head injuries. Some of the casualties travelled by sea for 25 minutes to Guernsey on board the Flying Christine III, the Guernsey's St John Ambulance and Rescue's marine ambulance, pictured. The group were touring the island at . Dos Dains, when the carriage appears to have hit a hedge and rolled over . just after noon yesterday. A further two carriages were also part of the tour, Canadian passenger Michael Seredynsky was in the front one. He said: '‘I suddenly became aware of the carriage behind us overtaking which, our driver remarked as it passed us, was very unusual. ‘It sounded to me as if the horse was galloping. It went around a bend, we heard a crash and when we rounded the bend we heard people shouting and the carriage was on its side.’ Inspector . Trevor Coleman, from Guernsey Police, said emergency responders, including Sark police constables and Sark Fire and Rescue Service, worked . quickly in difficult conditions to help the patients on the island . before they were transported. Steve Ford, from Guernsey's St John Ambulance and Rescue team, said private boats had to be drafted in to help them collect the injured passengers from Sark. This morning he confirmed that the woman who died was Dora Jufer, aged 67, from Melchnau in Switzerland. He added: 'At about 12.15pm on Tuesday, June 26, an incident . occurred at the Dos D’Ane, Sark involving a horse drawn van. The van was . carrying a party of Swiss tourists. 'The van mounted a hedge and rolled onto its side. 'One woman sustained injuries that have subsequently . proved fatal. The woman died during a tour of Sark, the smallest of the Channel Islands, on a horse-drawn carriage . This map shows the two hour journey the casualties took to hospital. The injured group travelled by tractor-drawn carriage from the scene of the accident in Le Dos D'ane in Sark, to the island's port. They were then collected by a marine ambulance and private boats for the 25 minute journey to St Peter Port in Guernsey. Finally, after a ten minute ride by a road ambulance, they arrived as Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Le Vauquiedor . 'A second person, a male, has serious injuries and the . others, including the driver, have sustained a range of other injuries. 'All of those involved were transferred to Guernsey by boat . after having initial treatment in Sark. 'Emergency responders in Sark reacted to the incident within . minutes and worked extremely well in very difficult conditions. 'Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue together with Police were . invited to assist and travelled to Sark. Enquiries are continuing. 'Our thoughts are with those involved in the accident, . especially the family of the deceased.' Sark is one of the few remaining . places in the world where cars are banned from roads and only tractors . and horse drawn vehicles are allowed. Part of the Channel Islands, the small islands has a population . of about 600 with an area of just 5.5 square kilometres. It only has one school . and is dependent on tourism. An inquest into the woman's death is due to open in the next few days. Sark is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, a British Crown . dependency in the English Channel. The self-governing island became part of the Duchy of Normandy . in 933 and over the following centuries the small island was fought over between . the English and French. The French left the island in 1549 and shortly after became . Crown property once again. During World War II, the island was occupied by German forces . from 1940–1945, as were the other Channel Islands. In 2008 the island changed its system of government in order . to introduce a wider parliament, following pressure from the EU. The island is a car-free zone, but tractors are allowed.","The injured woman travelled in the island's only ambulance - dragged by a tractor .

"Slept badly? Had strange dreams? Blame the moon. People have more weird and wonderful dreams around the time of the full moon, a British study found. The content of our dreams doesn’t vary with the seasons or with the days of the week, it showed. But in the week or so surrounding a full moon, they are decidedly more ‘weird and bizarre’. Psychologist Richard Wiseman made the surprise discovery as he analysed the experiences of 1,000 volunteers who were played sounds as they slept. People have more weird and wonderful dreams around the time of the full moon, a British study found . He said: ‘For instance, someone might dream that they are flying on a dragon, then get off the dragon and go and have a cup of coffee with George Clooney. Some people dreamt they were superheroes. ‘They thought they were Batman or Superman, fighting crime. Whereas most dreams were very pedestrian, things like being in the office all day, typing.’ The findings build on Swiss  research last year which found we take longer to fall asleep, sleep for 20 minutes less and sleep less soundly at full moon. Production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin is also altered. Professor Wiseman believes that this may disturb our dreams. Another, stranger explanation is that we evolved to be sensitive to the moon’s rhythms. According to this theory, sleeping lightly at the full moon would have made us more alert to predators, who might take advantage of the stronger moonlight to go hunting. Study concluded the 'completely bizarre' finding while analysing the dreams of people who listened to sounds as they slept . Our ancestors may also have hunted when the moon was full, with the result that we still find it hard to settle on bright nights. While Professor Wiseman isn’t convinced by the evolutionary explanation, he does acknowledge that the moon seems to affect our sleep. He suggests those with a partner who is particularly affected make use of the sofa or spare room during a full moon. He made the ‘completely bizarre’ finding while analysing the dreams of people who listened to sounds as they slept. Half a million people took part using a free mobile phone app that plays a range of noises. The user sets an alarm, and if the phone’s motion sensor detects  that they are dreaming in the 40 minutes before the alarm is due to go off, the sounds are played. After the alarm goes off, they are asked to record their dream. We are most likely to remember dreams from just before waking. A study of 1,000 such records showed that hearing birdsong or rustling grass led to dreams about greenery and flowers, while the squawk of seagulls led to thoughts of days at the beach. Car horns and traffic provoked unsettled dreams. Professor Wiseman, who describes his findings in his book Night School, said having more uplifting dreams has advantages beyond leaping out of bed in a good mood. He said: ‘We have discovered a way of giving people sweet dreams, and this may also form the basis for a new type of therapy to help those suffering from certain psychological problems, such as depression.’ People who are depressed dream more than others, probably because their brain is using the downtime to work through their concerns. The hope is that better dreams will make it easier for them to rationalise their worries and so improve their health.","People have weird and wonderful dreams at time of full moon, study says .

Dressed in a plain claret dress for . the studio part, she was decidedly low key as she talked about the . non-profit story and how she came to NBC. She said: 'For most of my life, I did deliberately lead a private life and inadvertently led a public life.' She credited her late grandmother, .

"Nigel Pearson has escaped punishment for appearing to throttle James McArthur but has been reminded of his responsibilities by the Football Association. Leicester boss Pearson appeared to grab McArthur around the throat during Crystal Palace's 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. The FA is understood to have contacted Pearson, who had been rumoured to have been sacked on Sunday, but will not take any further action against the Foxes boss. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson escaped punishment from the FA for grabbing James McArhur by the throat . Pearson proceeded to hold on to the Crystal Palace midfielder's top and would not let go . The FA are believed to have contacted Pearson warning him of his responsibilities . Pearson was rumoured to have been sacked on Sunday night as his side sit bottom of the Premier League . Leicester, who are still rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table, take on Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night. Pearson has attempted to laugh off his touchline scuffle with Palace's record signing McArthur, who almost joined Leicester when leaving Wigan last summer. Leicester manager Pearson rounded on Match of the Day pundits after the BBC show's panel condemned his handling of the incident with the Palace midfielder. Pearson accused the BBC pundits of making 'a mountain out of a molehill'. Gary Lineker branded the incident 'strange', while Danny Murphy questioned any 'underlying' issue after McArthur's transfer from Wigan to Leicester collapsed in the summer. Pearson said: 'I thought they were slightly disruptive, yes. I don't care what they think of me, I pay my tax bills. I didn't see it until the morning. Pearson faced the media on Monday and accused BBC pundits of making 'a mountain out of a molehill' The Leicester manager claimed that the incident was 'very light-hearted' and there was nothing in it . 'It's not helpful when the three fountains of knowledge on Match of the Day make a mountain out of a molehill, there's nothing in that on Saturday. The lad's okay and it was very light-hearted. 'He has said that too. It was all very light-hearted, if you see the pictures it was with smiles.' Pearson claimed after Saturday's defeat he could 'look after himself', but Lineker hinted on Twitter Pearson was sacked by one member of the Srivaddhanaprabha family, who own the club, before being reinstated by another. When asked if he was a fountain of knowledge, the former England striker tweeted: 'If I was I'd tell you that he was sacked by one of the owners' family and reinstated by another, but then I'm not.' The club took almost four hours on Sunday evening to dismiss claims Pearson had been axed.

"AC Milan have accused Juventus of doctoring television graphics to convince viewers that Carlos Tevez was onside for his controversial goal on Saturday night. League leaders Juventus beat rivals AC Milan 3-1 in Turin, but there was considerable angst among Milan fans, who believed that Tevez was offside for the opening goal of the game. Milan tweeted a photograph, supposedly taken from Juventus TV's analysis of the incident. The picture appears to show a clearly manipulated line, to prove that Tevez was onside when he was, in fact, not. Carlos Tevez, wrongly or rightly, shoots to put Juventus 1-0 up against AC Milan in Turin on Saturday . In a statement to Corriere della Serra, Milan's general manager Adriano Galliani took things a step further by saying: . 'The production of the television images for Juve home games is controlled by the club itself. They purposely don’t show the replay of the opening goal. 'I’m going to kick up a storm at the next Lega [Serie A] assembly to ensure the Lega can produce all of the games without conceding the option to just one club to control their own images. Tevez (left) celebrates alongside team-mate Paul Pogba as Juventus get off to an excellent start against Milan . Tevez (left) watches on as his ball crosses the line; his goal stood, but some claimed it shouldn't have . 'I am against the fact that they just end up showing what they want.' Backing up their general manager's claims, the official AC Milan website also posted a short statement, which read: . 'Arrogance is a Juventus trait and something they cannot escape from. 'It would be superfluous to respond to anyone like this. It is a good thing, however, that even they agree to open up the discussion and debate over the production of TV graphics which emerged following the episode during Juventus-Milan last night.'","Carlos Tevez scored the opening goal as Juventus beat AC Milan 3-1 .

"Sky have won a major power battle with BT Sport as the Premier League broadcast rights were sold in a staggering £5.136billion deal - worth over £10m per game. Sky have swept up the majority of the live slots - winning five of the seven packages that were on offer. From 2016, Sky will have the Saturday 12.45pm, Sunday 1.30pm, Sunday 4pm, Monday night and new Friday night matches - plus Bank Holiday and other Sunday slots. The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal . Sky Sports pundits (left to right) Graeme Souness, Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry, Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville will have more matches to analyse than ever before . The Premier League has announced a record £5.136bn TV rights deal to be shared between Sky and BT Sport . Graphic charts the significant rise of domestic Premier League TV revenue . This leaves BT Sport with the 5.30pm Saturday slot and occasional midweek matches. BT will be delighted to gain greater clout with the new evening slot they have swapped with Sky for their current Saturday lunchtime broadcast, which is considered one of the weaker slots. And they can also console themselves with the fact they will start their three-year deal to broadcast 350 live Champions League and Europa League games next season. But it is clear that Sky remain the big player in Premier League TV rights. The most lucrative sale of club football rights in global football means Premier League clubs will retain their status as the richest in the world collectively. The jaw-dropping revenues mean each game will have cost £10.2m. The total figure is a rise of more than 70 per cent on the £3.018bn collected last time for 2013-16. The value of overseas rights is also expected to grow as they are sold in regional bundles over the next year. The upshot is that from the 2016-17 season the bottom club in the Premier League can expect around £99m in central prize money each season (up from £62m now) and the highest earning club can expect around £156m (up from £97.5m). Seven packages were available in the auction, five with 28 games per season and two with 14 games per season. THE PACKAGES SKY WON . Package A comprises 28 games on Saturday lunchtimes (12.30pm). Package C has 28 games kicking off between 1.30pm and 2.15pm on Sundays. Pack A has 6 'first pick' games from 38 rounds and B has 9 first picks. Package D is the 4pm Sunday bundle of 28 games - crucially with 18 'first pick' games. Package E is the 'Monday night football' (8pm) bundle, with 18 games on Mondays plus 10 on Fridays; this is the first time Premier League games will be shown live on Friday evenings. There are no first picks in this package. Package G is a bundle of 14 games on Bank Holidays and other Sunday matches with two first picks. THE PACKAGES BT SPORT WON . Package B has 28 games at tea-time on Saturdays (5.30pm) Packages F has 14 games, a mix of midweek and Saturday games including three first picks. Under the current ongoing deals Sky have paid £2.28bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season, or in other words, get 348 games at £6,551,724 each. BT have paid £738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season, or in other words, get 114 games at £6,473,684 each. 50 per cent of the revenue is divided equally between the clubs . 25 per cent is awarded on a merit basis, determined by final league positions . 25 per cent is distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches . NICK HARRIS . Sky Sports pundits Souness (left) and Henry analyse a recent televised game . BT Sport presenter Jake Humphreys with pundits Michael Owen, Steve McManaman and David James . Presenters from the two stations were quick to reveal their views on social media, with Gary Neville tweeting: 'I want sensible ticket pricing and grass roots football to benefit as much as possible from this deal. Who doesn't! This is a big issue! 'However the @SkyFootball staff produce / direct and present football better than anyone else. The best won!' And Jamie Carragher said: 'That's the coaching badges out the window for a few years. 'Great day for @SkyFootball but with the amounts involved ticket pricing especially for away fans has to change. £20 for the 20 away games.' BT Sport frontman Jake Humphrey added: 'Delighted that @premierleague football remains on @btsport for another 3 years. More games, plus Champs League, FA Cup & European matches.' The total paid by the two broadcasters is more than the annual BBC budget, according to the Corporations' most recent financial reports. Total revenue - including the Licence Fee - amounted to £5.066bn in 2013-14, £70m less than the £5.136bn paid by Sky and BT Sport to air 168 football matches. Total £5.136bn figure is a rise of more than 70 per cent on the 2013-16 price . BT Sport have swapped their early Saturday slot for the 5.30pm fixtures . 'Only Sky Sports will have the best match picks and the best slots so our viewers will be able to follow the biggest matches, the key head to heads and every club at least four times,' Sky Sports Managing Director Barney Francis said. 'No other broadcaster comes close.' John Petter, BT Consumer CEO said: 'I am pleased we will be showing Premier League football for a further three years and that we have secured the prime Saturday evening slot. 'These new rights will enhance our existing schedule of football, rugby and other international sport, including all the live footballing action from the UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues starting this summer. Anticipated bids from the Discovery Channel and beIN Sport did not materialise, meaning consumers should not have to pay additional subscription costs to watch live Premier League football. Tom Mockridge, chief executive officer of Virgin Media, said: 'A 70 per cent increase shows the TV rights auction is a licence for the Premier League to print money.' 'This is hurting fans and does not warrant an exemption from normal competition law rules.' Premier League highlights rights remained with the BBC's Match of the Day programme in a £204m deal announced last month - this was an increase of 13.5 per cent on the previous deal of £179m. The new deal will start in 2016 with bids from beIN Sports and the Discovery Channel failing to materialise . Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'Last season saw record levels of attendance with the highest top-flight crowds since 1949/50, as well as increased viewing figures across all our UK rights holders. 'Both Sky Sports and BT Sport have done a tremendous job in bringing the game to the fans as well as providing the revenue that allows clubs to invest in football, facilities, youth development and their communities. 'It is an endorsement of what the Barclays Premier League delivers that these broadcast partnerships have been extended and enhanced today. We are grateful for the continued belief that Sky Sports and BT Sport have in the Premier League and our clubs, both as a sporting competition and organisations to work with. 'We are also grateful to the significant interest and participation in the process from other highly credible parties.' Sky Sports is £24.50 extra a month with any Sky TV bundle, or £27.25 on Virgin Media (£7 increase on HD), while BT Sport is free with BT Broadband or £13.50 a month on Sky. SKY SPORTS . Jeremy Darroch, Sky's Group Chief Executive: 'This is a good result and confirms that Sky is the unrivalled choice for sports fans. We went into the Premier League auction with a clear objective and are pleased to have secured the rights that we wanted.'

"New information suggests the actress had an affair with her female acting coach . Marilyn Monroe had a secret lesbian affair with her domineering German acting teacher, newly unearthed documents reveal. They show that the actress lived as ‘man and wife’ with Columbia Pictures drama coach Natasha Lytess for two of the seven years they worked together from 1948 to 1955. Miss Monroe, who was married three times, is said to have admitted to lesbian flings with fellow stars Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich and Barbara Stanwyck, as well affairs with Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra and John and Bobby Kennedy. Now a pair of Miss Monroe’s jeans is up for sale, with a letter of authenticity from Miss Lytess. The flannel-lined high-waisted pair was given to Miss Lytess by her ‘dearest friend’ and is on offer for between £400 and £500 on website auctionmystuff.com. Although the letter from Miss Lytess does not discuss their relationship, she disclosed details in an interview given in 1962 – the year the actress died – which has been discovered. Miss Monroe once told her close friend, actor Ted Jordan, that she and Miss Lytess were sleeping together. ‘Why not?’ she said. ‘Sex is something you do with people you like. What could be wrong with a natural act?’ When they first met in 1946 when Miss Monroe was 20, says Miss Lytess, 'she was not beautiful'. Speaking in a 1962 interview, she said: 'She couldn’t speak, she didn’t know how to open her mouth, and she feared everything.' She also claimed the actress was 'always naked' in the home they shared. 'Naked, she was always naked in the house. 6 or 7 or 8 hours...she was naked all day long! And I’m not exaggerating!' But, she added, the actress was also crippled with insecurities. Marilyn Monroe is believed to have had an affair with her older German acting coach Natasha Lytess (left) while the pair lived together . In 1962, Miss Lytess gave an interview in which she said the actress 'hated sex' but was always naked in the house. They are pictured together during a 1948 acting lesson . 'She was afraid of giving up all that had made her as Marilyn the sexiest girl: dresses, make-up, moves. Because she thought she had nothing to give except sex appeal. In fact it’s interesting because she really hated sex! 'Yes Marilyn. She hates sex. She was afraid of that. When someone told her, “You look sexy,’ she did not like that.' Natasha, who died from cancer in 1964, said she was with Marilyn for ten years and they were so close the actress would often insist that they held hands, even when they were filming a scene. 'On the set I was always very close to her,' she said in the interview. 'I had to be so close to her that she was always asking: ""Can she be a little bit closer to me?"" The director answered, ""Yes but we see her in the camera."" 'Very often, during close-ups I had to hold her hand. I had to support her every time. 'Thanks to the specificities of the close-up - which films only the head or the shoulders - I could hold her hand without being filmed by the camera. I had to do it to give her some courage.' The acting coach also claimed to have saved the famous actress from death after discovering her  in bed with a bottle of sleeping pills. 'I saw Marilyn in her bed, her hair was uncombed, she was not really covered up and her face was awfully pale. Her cheeks were swelled and she had a vacant look. I said, “What have you done Marilyn?"" 'She answered, ""Nothing."" And I violently slapped her because I was terrified you know. I opened her mouth and it was full of an awful green thing. 'I do not know what it was but I took it from her mouth with my hand. She had swallowed sixteen sleeping pills. The actress was married three times. Her last husband Arthur Miller (left) was a playwright, while second husband, Joe DiMaggio (right) was a baseball player . Her first marriage was to James Dougherty in 1942 before the actress shot to fame in Hollywood . ‘The doctor told me that dose was so high that it could have killed her. At that moment of her life she wanted to kill herself because she was lost.' In her recent book, Marilyn: The Passion and the paradox, author Lois Banner wrote: 'Natasha and Marilyn lived together as husband and wife, although Marilyn often simply wanted to be held. 'She was like a child in her need for physical affection.' 'Miss Lytees made me free,' Monroe would say later. 'She gave me balance and made me understand life. I owe everything to her.' The actress's jeans are on sale as part of the AuctionMyStuff.com Pop and Memorabilia Sale, which is open for online bids until September 21. Also for sale is a pair of rhinestone, dangling earrings owned and worn by Monroe. Other items in the auction include a glove worn by Michael Jackson on his 1997 Australian tour, framed with his signature, a Corsettes Boulevard Ltd black taffeta and silk outfit worn by Lady Gaga, a red corduroy McAll shirt belonging to James Dean and a photograph from Les Miserables signed by Anne Hathaway.","Actress lived with coach for two years while they worked together .

"French prosecutors have requested a five to six month suspended jail sentence for Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage following an alleged assault in a beachfront restaurant. The European Player of the Year, who has been hoping to make a late charge into England's World Cup squad, was arrested last month along with teammate Xavier Chiocci following an incident involving a 30-year-old professional tennis coach.

Steffon Armitage (right) has been told he should face a suspended sentence according to prosecutors . Armitage denied any wrongdoing and admitted to being 'very inebriated', adding that he did not remember hitting anyone voluntarily. 'I contest the charges against me.

"Something to hide? Professor Brian Cathcart has had time off to campaign against a free Press - but who has paid his salary? Hacked Off co-founder and university professor Brian Cathcart yesterday faced questions about who is paying his salary while he campaigns for state-imposed regulation of the Press. The executive director of the lobby group – fronted by actor Hugh Grant – has been on leave of absence from his academic job for nine months. But the man whose organisation is demanding greater openness and transparency from newspapers refuses to say whether the taxpayer is funding his sabbatical. Mr Cathcart, 56, professor of journalism at Kingston University, is understood to be receiving around two-thirds of his estimated £80,000-a-year salary while he runs the high-profile pressure group that is demanding statutory legislation of the Press. During his time off he has played a key public role for the organisation and was one of four Hacked Off representatives who sat in on controversial late-night talks in Ed Miliband’s Commons office when the controversial Royal Charter on newspaper regulation was agreed by the three political parties. Hacked Off has consistently defied calls to identify its donors. Earlier this year the lobby group refused to tell MPs the names of the rich individuals bankrolling its fight for a Press law and Professor Cathcart was criticised by the audience at a Glasgow literary festival when he refused to name its backers. Over several days, the Mail has made detailed requests to Professor Cathcart, Hacked Off and Kingston University, in South-West London, to reveal whether the taxpayer is funding his sabbatical but they have refused to answer. Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Any suggestion that taxpayers have paid for Brian Cathcart to work for Hacked Off is deeply worrying and requires explanation. ‘It’s vital that those involved come clean about whether hard-pressed families are funding Mr Cathcart’s time lobbying for Press regulation. ‘Hacked Off’s campaign has resulted in vital Press freedoms being threatened. If this work has been subsidised by taxpayers it will only add to the scandal.’ On Professor Cathcart’s Kingston University website it says: ‘Brian joined the university as one of its founding members of the journalism department in 2003, and has watched student numbers grow to 300 in that time. Major players: Jemima Khan has made a £5,000 donation to the pressure group Hacked Off, which is fronted by Hugh Grant . ‘He was made a professor in 2006, and teaches at all three levels on the journalism BA course.’ Messages sent to his university email address received the reply: ‘Brian Cathcart is on leave of absence from Kingston University from September 2012.’ The Hacked Off campaign was launched by the Media Standards Trust in July 2011 in the wake of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. The professor and the trust’s Martin Moore co-founded the lobby group, which represents celebrities and other victims of Press intrusion. During his leave of absence from the university’s school of humanities, Professor Cathcart has been prominent in reacting to the Leveson inquiry report and has frequently appeared in print and on TV and radio demanding greater newspaper regulation. Hacked Off has come under increasing pressure to disclose the source of its funds. Heiress Jemima Khan confirmed she had given £5,000 to the group fronted by her ex-boyfriend Mr Grant and last month financier Arpad Busson and chart-topping music producer Guy Chambers were named as secret donors. Chief: Hacked Off have continued to campaign through Lord Leveson's inquiry into Press regulation . On its website the only funding Hacked Off discloses is money from Mr Grant, a £50,000 grant over 2012-13 from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and more than £20,000 it says it is soon to receive from the Journalism Foundation, a charitable body set up by the owners of the Independent newspapers. Kingston University had an income of £203million in 2011/12 with £73million of the cash coming in public money provided by government funding and £98million in tuition fees and education contracts.The university said the Data Protection Act prevented it from discussing Professor Cathcart’s absence. The Mail made repeated efforts to speak to Professor Cathcart without success. A series of questions was sent to Hacked Off about his year off and his salary arrangements, including whether Mr Cathcart thought his work with the lobby group was a suitable use of a sabbatical funded by the taxpayer. Hacked Off replied: ‘Professor Cathcart is currently on leave of absence from Kingston University and working as executive director of Hacked Off. ‘His salary is a private matter. He, the university and the Government all take the view that, where possible, academics should contribute to society and to public life.’ By Miles Goslett . Secret: Lord Justice Leveson with the Report from the Inquiry into the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press has refused to discuss his findings . The judge who chaired the public inquiry into the newspaper industry is refusing requests to appear in front of MPs to discuss his report and the future of the Press. The Daily Mail has been told that over the last six months Lord Justice Leveson has received several invitations from the Commons culture, media and sport select committee to face questions at a special parliamentary hearing. Sources say Lord Justice Leveson, who delivered his report into media standards last November, is ‘well aware’ that the committee is keen to scrutinise him publicly over which of the proposals under discussion he believes would deliver the best system of Press regulation, but all offers have so far been rebuffed. It is unlikely that other aspects of the Leveson Inquiry – including the controversial relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins, a lawyer working on Leveson’s team, and David Sherborne, a barrister acting for celebrity phone-hacking victims – could be examined because of restrictions set out by the Judicial Executive Board on judges commenting on public figures. The pair struck up a close friendship while the Leveson inquiry was under way, going on holiday together to a Greek island last August. They deny their affair began before the inquiry ended in December, but critics believe they may have breached official guidelines by becoming so close last summer. John Whittingdale, the media select committee’s chairman, has been in regular contact with the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, since last December about the possibility of Lord Justice Leveson appearing though so far no formal summons has been made. Lord Judge, in effect Lord Justice Leveson’s boss, must give his permission before the judge can make an appearance. Official guidelines do not forbid sitting judges from appearing in front of select committees but they do limit their ability to discuss certain matters, including ‘the personalities or merits of... politicians, and other public figures...’ as well as individual legal cases. But the rules say nothing about judges who have led public inquiries, and the committee is ready to toughen its stance in order to force Lord Justice Leveson to attend a hearing so that his views can be considered. A source said: ‘It is surely an irony that Sir Brian Leveson is the only person associated with this public inquiry from whom the public have not heard. ‘He was asked by the Government to lead a public inquiry. He did so at considerable public expense. Admittedly we’ve moved on from the recommendations he made in his report last year but this is very much a live issue for the committee, who would be very, very interested to hear from him.’ Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It is ridiculous that Lord Justice Leveson should be excused from sharing his thoughts in public on the crucial matter of the future of the Press.’ The newspaper industry is still locked in a stalemate with the Government over how it should be regulated. A spokesman for the Judiciary said: ‘The chairman of the select committee has spoken to the Lord Chief Justice, who has concerns about Lord Justice Leveson’s position. The chairman has told the Lord Chief Justice he understands those concerns and together they are considering how best to meet them.’","Brian Cathcart refuses to answer questions about who is funding his 'sabbatical'

"Frank Lampard finally got the chance to meet his New York City team-mates on Tuesday as they prepared to take on St Mirren in a friendly at Manchester City's academy stadium. After agreeing a contract with the MLS side in July, Lampard joined Manchester City on loan in August, on a deal initially reported to be until January, where he would then join up with his New York team-mates to prepare for the American season, beginning in March. Lampard's City deal now runs until the end of the Premier League season, therefore meaning that the former Chelsea midfielder had not met his New York team-mates due to his Premier League commitments in Manchester.
