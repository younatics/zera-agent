"By . Victoria Woollaston . You'd be forgiven for thinking that the images in Michael Fennell's collection are photographs, yet not only are the realistic pieces of art in fact paintings, they are created using smoke. These smoke paintings are produced using large . canvases suspended above Fennell’s head and as he holds the candle close . to the canvas, the charcoal particles in the smoke hit the surface and . form marks. His canvases feature musicians, novelists and sport stars, among others, and sell for between £3,000 and £5,000 each. Artist Michael Fennell uses candles and smoke to create paintings in his Lake District studio that so realistic they are mistaken for photographs. The 43-year-old suspends metre-tall canvases overhead and uses flames like brushes to 'paint' using carbon particles in smoke. His canvases feature musicians, such as conductor Sir Robert Norrington, pictured, novellists and sport stars, among others, and sell for £3,000 to £5,000 each . Fennell was introduced to Sir Norrington, pictured, through a friend in a string quartet. He said: 'Roger liked the idea of the originality of my work and said 'Let's just go for it' Fennell became interested in smoke as a medium around 15 years ago after seeing a monochrome image that had been created by a plume of smoke. Having previously worked with oil, he told MailOnline he was also inspired by the marks left by charcoal and ink on his studio floor. ‘I saw the mark the flame had made [on the floor] and I was struck by how freeform it was. The mark almost resembled water, even though they’re very different materials. It couldn’t be created by anything else; a splash or scratch couldn’t create it and it was this unique nature that interested me.’ As well as moving the candle, Fennell said he uses different objects, such as card or his hand, to move the smoke and achieve different textures. Although he admitted there was, and still is, a lot of trial and error when working with the airborne medium. Yet Fennell believes this just adds to the overall effect, and makes the style unusual: ‘Everyone who sees them always asks how they’re done,’ explained Fennell, ‘which suggests to me that it’s unique. 'When paintings are labelled with just the word 'smoke', it hides a lot from the process' and he thinks this further adds to the mystery. Fennell is keen to keep a number of his processes a secret, yet told MailOnline that one thing he has learnt from using smoke is that the paintings must be ‘fixed.’ ‘Initially the canvases were framed behind glass, but the glass was suspended in front of the surface. The . painted smoke is fragile and even the lightest of touches can affect . it. 'When the paintings are kept in the studio, there have been times . when the lights have attracted moths who have hit the canvas and . disrputed the work. That shows how delicate it is.’ The . science of trying to fix it with different aerosols, moisture and so on . has added to the development of the pieces, added Fennell, and this gives the images ‘a sense of mystery.’ Rather than paint subjects in real-time, Fennell said he works mainly from his memory, using aides to guide him. Fennel said: ‘It’s the nature of the work that the paintings evolve and the likeness can come and go as each project progresses. I do use photographs, but I’m not a slave to them. He added: ‘I like the other arts, I love music and literature. There’s a portrait of William Boyd, pictured left, and I read most of his books before I met him.' Boyd, pictured right, is an award-winning British novelist . Many of the portraits are painted onto canvases a metre tall. Fennell explained that because of the movement and nature of smoke, paintings need to be big in order to manage the medium. Fennell's Amelia Earhart painting, left, appears to ‘glow because it’s got a very dark background and it’s such a contrast,' said the artist. This means it translates particularly well into a photo.’ Amelia Earhart, pictured right, is shown in her iconic jumpsuit with Fred Noonan in Los Angeles, May 1937 . Rather than painting subjects in real-time, Fennell said he works mainly from his memory, using aides to guide him. ‘It’s the nature of the work that the paintings evolve and the likeness can come and go as each project progresses. I do use photographs, but I’m not a slave to them’ adding that the health and safety elements of working with flames and smoke make life drawing difficult. Fennell added that many of his designs are inspired by his other interests: ‘I like the other arts, I love music and literature. For example, there’s a portrait of William Boyd and I read most of his novels before I met him.I produce adverts for jeweller Theo Fennell and he was friends with Boyd. Boyd had seen my work behind the scenes and I got to know him. Fennell said he is fascinated by the movement and fragility of the smoke on a canvas, as seen in this painting of ex-rugby player Matt Dawson . 'He was pleased with the finished portrait and to flatter me, he said he admired my draftmanship.’ Similarly, Michael Fennell was introduced to conductor Sir Roger Norrington through a friend in a string quartet. ‘Roger liked the idea of the originality of my work and said ‘Let’s just go for it’. We then worked through some sketches so I was pleased with the movement of the piece. ‘I use sketches because I like to visualise the end results’ continued Fennell, but he added because of the smoke's volatile nature and upredictability ‘happy accidents happen that you can never really know about beforehand.' Fennell also takes commissions and his canvases sell for between £3,000 and £5,000 each. Many of the portraits are painted onto canvases a metre tall. Fennell explained that because of the movement and nature of smoke, paintings need to be big in order to manage the medium. He is often asked if they will fade, but he reassures his clients of their light-fastness and durability having developed a successful fixing agent. Their longevity is more guaranteed than that of more traditional media such as watercolour and acrylic. ‘The first marks [in caves by our prehistoric ancestors] were done with natural pigments and I’m pretty sure they would have used burnt and crushed bones to make the marks. They may have even used an oil lamp. 'All mark making is made with things to hand, burnt items, pigments and so on. These ancient works haven’t disappeared, so my paintings have an assured permanency.’ When asked how the paintings appear to glow, Fennell said that this is partly to do with the contrast between black and white, and partly to do with the production of the photographs. The Amelia Earhart painting for example ‘glows because it’s got a very dark background and it’s such a contrast. ‘This means it translates particularly well into a photo viewed on a modern, high-tech computer.’ He continued that in the flesh, they do have more depth: ‘The smoke creates a prismatic effect that rakes across the surface. Slight changes and fluctuations in the carbon, even to a nanomillimetre, can be picked up by the eye and this adds more to the paintings than a photograph.’ Looking forward, Fennell said he is experimenting with other airborne materials, in particular gold pigment. 'I’ve started using small amounts of pigment in my work to add another element of shimmer and depth. I sprinkle it and it floats onto the surface.' He’s also recently been working on an advertising campaign, again with Theo Fennell, which features strong female heroines. ‘The paintings form a narrative piece to go with the jewellery. I can’t reveal too much about the project but it is based around strong female identities.‘ . Describing the medium Fennell said: ‘Smoke is unique; is not drawn, painted, printed, rubbed, flicked, blown or sprayed on. It can create the most beautiful blacks, that are 'luminous' and have depth to the extent that charcoal is flat and pale next to it. It can also create melting, nebulous edges and a great range of tones to rival those of photography.’ ‘Smoke as a drawing medium is of course fundamentally flawed - it is tremendously volatile and a line cannot be drawn with it, but perhaps more importantly you can easily ignite your paper and burn down your studio!’ Describing the medium Fennell said: ‘Smoke is unique. It is not drawn, painted, printed, rubbed, flicked, blown or sprayed on. It can create the most beautiful blacks, that are 'luminous' and have depth to the extent that charcoal is flat and pale next to it. It can also create melting, nebulous edges and a great range of tones to rival those of photography.’ The image on the left is entitled Queen Of The Bees, while the right-hand image is called Lady Picador .","Artist Michael Fennell uses candles and smoke to create paintings so realistic they are mistaken for photographs .

"By . Ted Thornhill . These pictures show the dramatic rescue of a one-eyed horse called Ruby, who had fallen into a cold river and was close to drowning. The 21-year-old animal fell into River Irwell near Bolton, Lancashire, and had to fight to keep her head above the water. Rider Karen Haslam had taken her out for a trot on Monday morning when the mare stumbled and fell as Ms Haslam walked beside her.

In the country: The dramatic incident took place in a picturesque spot . Muscle power: It took all the might of over 10 firefighters to pull Ruby to safety . Miss Haslam grabbed onto Ruby's reins while calling 999 - and firefighters to rushed to the scene had to seek help from a nearby water aid unit to help pull her out. A crew of 10 from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue finally pulled her to safety but not before she’d endured over an hour in the water. In the end the crew had to call on even more colleagues to get her off the river bank. All is well: Ruby was eventually upright on dry land again after an hour-long rescue mission . Popular: The River Irwell in Lancashire is popular with horse riders, walkers and canoeists . Ruby, who lost an eye as a young horse after an illness, has since been given the all clear by vets. Miss Haslam said: ‘I am so relieved that it all turned out okay and I would like to sing the fire service's praises. ‘Ruby kept so calm and coped brilliantly with the shock of being in the river.’","One-eyed horse Ruby fell into the frigid River Irwell in Lancashire .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A Spanish singer became a Twitter sensation after accepting an invitation from a Kim Jong-un imposter to perform in North Korea alongside Spanish D-list celebrities. Leticia Sabater, 47, responded within minutes of the bogus request to sing at the Festival of Uranium, genuinely enquiring about payment and dates. To the amusement of @norcoreano's 144,000 followers, the duped performer was won over. Duped: Leticia Sabater, 47, delighted Twitter users by entering negotiations with a fake Kim Jong-un account . Hilarious: The fake Kim Jong-un account tweeted an invite saying: 'As you know this year it is the Festival of Uranium and we would like to discuss it with you, what are your details'. Within minutes, Miss Sabater responded: 'What's that', to the delight of hundreds of Twitter users . 'OK, perfect,' she tweeted, after he promised 'the cost of the flight, of course, will be paid for'. The surreal exchange on Friday started when the presenter-turned-actress-turned-singer tweeted an invite to her 11,500 followers to appear in her new video. She was met with a tweet from the supposed Kim Jong-un saying: 'Hello Leticia, as you know this year it is the Festival of Uranium and we would like to discuss it with you, what are your details?' In a response that received 261 retweets and 110 favourites within minutes, Miss Sabater missed the nuclear power reference, and responded: 'What's that?' 'An international culture festival that features a Spanish contingency and all kinds of artists,' replied @norcoreano, a name which translates as 'North Korean'. He boasted that the winner of Spain's first Big Brother, Ismael Beiro, and Venezuelan singer Carlos Baute had already accepted invites to attend the Pyongyang event. The imposter assured Miss Sabater, who started out as a presenter, all expenses would be paid for . After a few messages, she passed the imposter her email address and asked him to email a full proposal . Negotiations: 'It is an international culture festival featuring a Spanish contingency, with all kinds of artists,' he said, adding that they are negotiating deals with Venezuelan singer Carlos Baute and Big Brother winner Ismael Biero. 'Money is no problem. It will be in Pyongyang,' he said . 'Money is no problem,' he added, meriting another 190 retweets. Despite the flurry of attention from both her followers and those of @norcoreano, Miss Sabater seemed to be lured in. There was a silence, before the satirical tweeter told his followers: 'I can confirm we are in negotiations to get Leticia Sabater involved in the Festival of Uranium'. She then responded with her email address, asking for more details. He soon informed readers: 'The negotiations to get Leticia Sabater involved in the International Festival of Uranium are going well.' The pay and schedule negotiations continued in a series of grabs of private messages which @norcoreano tweeted to his followers, that have now been deleted. Spectators of the surprising exchange rushed to inform Miss Sabater she may get to meet Dennis Rodman, the basketball player who famously harbours a friendship with the North Korean dictator and often visits . The North Korean leader's imposter eventually told the singer she would not have to sing live if she preferred not to: 'If I'm honest,' he messaged, 'we have a playback, I don't know what you think about that? A couple of songs, and one duet with Carlos Baute.' Convinced, Miss Sabater said: 'You have my email, if you want to email me the offer a half-hour performance and prelude on May 24 and 25... or send it to me today if you want, that's great, I'll have a look and let you know.' 'Sweet, we'll leave it at that,' he said, adding: 'This week I'll send you the offer, at the moment I am sealing a deal with Darek [a celebrity and stripper] and Dinio [a singer and porn star].' To which she said: 'OK, perfect'. The exchange shocked amused Twitter users, many tweeting the singer to tell her she may get to meet Dennis Rodman, the basketball player who famously harbours a close friendship with the North Korean leader. But Miss Sabater appeared unaware that the highly-publicised diplomatic tensions and threat of nuclear attack would deter most western from jetting to the reclusive state for a show.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . There’s something magical about visiting iconic places after dark, and art fans will be soon be able to do just that at the Tate Britain. Yet instead of travelling into London after hours, these unique tours will take place remotely through the use of web-controlled robots. The scheme, called After Dark, lets virtual visitors drive these droids around the museum’s exhibitions, and see them in a new light - both figuratively and literally. The After Dark project was the winning idea in this year's Tate Britain IK Prize. It lets users remotely drive robots fitted with cameras around the museum. At the start of a session, four different tours, pictured, are shown at various points around the museum and visitors can choose the exhibition to visit . The IK Prize was set up by Tate Britain to ‘celebrate creative talent in the digital industry.’ There were four shortlisted proposals from a total of 51 entries. The runners-up included: Evan Boehm with Nexus Productions for Through the Eyes of an Eight-Year-Old. Adam Clarke from thecommonpeople.tv for TateCraft - an immersive experience where the museum was created in the land of Minecraft. Storythings, by Matt Locke and Kim Plowright, for #TateText, which featured stories about the art work being shared on social media. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales was among the judges on the panel for the inaugural prize. After Dark was created by London-based designers The Workers and was the winning concept of this year’s IK Prize. After the project launches, each robot will be controlled online by a driver. Other people from around the world can join that driver’s tour as passengers. The virtual tours are timed, and once a driver’s turn comes to an end, the tour passes to one of the passengers. As they make their way through the museum, a camera fitted with a light will shine on the exhibits and the visitors will be able to read details about the different art work on screen.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . Being kept up at night by the sound of neighbours or because you live on a busy road is not uncommon - but a French couple was left sleep deprived and depressed because of a noisy peacock next door. The husband and wife, from Marseille in southern France, sued the town hall after they alleged that they had been left depressed and suffering from insomnia because of the animal's persistent squawking. The couple said that they both had to resort to psychotherapy because of the noise. A peacock (not the bird pictured) drove a French couple to seek psychological help after they were kept awake by a noisy peacock . The peacock was given to the local mayor . in 2008 as a present. But the bird often escaped its pen and had been . running loose in the 9th district of Marseille - next to the Maison Blanche park in the city. In 2009, after the bird had escaped numerous times, council workers were sent out to the park to find the peacock but were unsuccessful in finding the perpetrator. The peacock was eventually found and shipped off to a farm outside Marseille. In court, medical documents were shown confirming that the couple had been suffering from insomnia and depression. In 2012, the pair tried to sue the town hall but were awarded just £82 in compensation. Outraged, they opened the case again this year and were paid out £1,658 in damages after a court concluded that the council had not done enough to control the bird. After claiming legal costs, the couple received a total payout of £3,316. Despite their beautiful appearance, peacocks are known for their shrill cries, similar to the sound of an old-fashioned horn being blasted. The cry is not dissimilar to a seagull.

Mick Jagger's fashion designer girlfriend L'Wren Scott left her entire $9million estate to the Rolling Stones rocker before taking her own life last week. Scott, whose remains were cremated on Tuesday following a small, private funeral service in Los Angeles, left a simple will bequeathing all her jewelery, clothing, furniture, cars and other personal effects to 'Michael Phillip Jagger'. Jagger and the designer’s estranged family have however come to an agreement to split her ashes between them. Scroll down for video . Sole heir: Mick Jagger's fashion designer girlfriend L'Wren Scott (right) has left her entire $9million estate to the Rolling Stones singer . Her brother Randall Bambrough whom Scott had appointed as director of her faltering fashion business in November, has revealed that he plans to take Scott’s ashes to her childhood home in Utah . ‘She was cremated and I have some of her ashes,’ he told the Daily News. ‘Some of those ashes, they will be buried near our parents here in Utah. And there will be a ceremony, date to be determined, in Utah for all family members who will have an opportunity to see their friends and others.’ Bambrough said he wasn’t sure what the singer planned to do with his share of his late girlfriend’s remains. ‘They’re with the Jagger family. That’s all I can say,’ he said. Valuable real estate: According to her will, Mr Jagger will inherit Scott's $8million condo at 200 Eleventh Avenue, where the designer was found dead last week . Bambrough also said that Tuesday’s . funeral in Los Angeles had been in keeping with his sister’s wishes and . that she had wanted Jagger to be in charge of the arrangements. He said he wasn’t privy to details of his 49-year-old sister’s will. 'I haven’t heard anything at all about a will, other than there’s supposedly one out there,' Bambrough said. Born Luann Bambrough and raised by an adoptive Mormon family, Jagger's long-time partner left a small town in Utah at age 17 to build a career as a fashion designer and stylist. Scott had been estranged from her sister, Jan Bambrough Shane, who ended up being entirely excluded from the will along with their brother, Randy. They won't get a dime: Miss Scott specified in her will that none of her possessions or property would go to her estranged sister Jan Bambrough Shane (pictured left with her husband) or to her brother Randy (right) Last goodbye: A small, private funeral service who held for Miss Scott in Los Angeles Tuesday, attended by her boyfriend, friends and family . 'Expect if otherwise provided in this . will, I have intentionally omitted to provide herein for any other my . heirs living at the date of my death,’ Scott wrote. Probate . documents obtained by the paper detailed that Miss Scott owned a condo . at 200 Eleventh Avenue in Manhattan worth $8million and another . $1million in 'tangible personal property and various other assets,' reports the New York Post. Miss Scott also added in her final will and testament: 'I have never been married. I have no children.'However, she later crossed out the word 'never' without providing a further explanation. Scott and Jagger, 70, had been dating since 2001. The aging rock star was in Australia for a Rolling Stones tour when the designer killed herself. At the time of her death, Miss Scott's fashion line was reportedly millions of dollars in debt. Mr Jagger’s personal net worth is estimated to be around $305million.

"By . John Hall . Huge income: Mark Zuckerberg earned $3.3billion last year by selling stock options in Facebook . Mark Zuckerberg earned $3.3billion last year by selling stock options in his social network Facebook. Despite limiting his salary at the company he founded in a Harvard University dorm room to just $1, Zuckerberg, 29, received a huge tax bill as a result of the stock sale, a new regulatory filing revealed. The documents, which were filed yesterday, mark the second year in a row that the Facebook CEO has made a large gain on the holding he accumulated in Facebook since starting the company in 2004, after his 2012 stock option earnings totalled $2.3billion. Zuckerberg has now exhausted his supply of the 60 million stock options he was given as a result of Facebook's public offering in 2012. He sold 41.35 million shares for $55.05 each in December, primarily to pay his tax bill on the gains. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, also donated 18 million Facebook shares to a Silicon Valley nonprofit organisation last December, totalling nearly Â£1billion. That single donation saw the couple top The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual list of the most generous Americans. Even after selling and donating so much Facebook stock, Zuckerberg still owns 426.3 million Facebook shares - which are currently valued at $25.7 billion. The stock has more than doubled in value in the last year after Zuckerberg fulfilled his promise to sell more advertising space on smartphones and tablet computers. The majority of people using Facebook now do so using these devices, as opposed to desktop or laptop computers. As a result of Zuckerberg's changes, Facebook now earns more than half of its advertising revenue through mobile devices - up from 23 per cent the previous year. Sale: Mark Zuckerberg has now exhausted his supply of the 60 million stock options he was given as a result of Facebook's public offering (pictured) in 2012 .

Zuckerberg did claim $653,164 in company expenses, however . In 2013, Zuckerberg asked Facebook to limit his salary to just $1 annually - something that Google co-founder Larry Page and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had also previously done. Zuckerberg did receive $653,164 compensation from Facebook last year however, with all but $3,000 being spent on private jet travel. Facebook says Zuckerberg is forced to travel to business meetings on private jets for security reasons. Even allowing for this expense, the money Zuckerberg took from Facebook's coffers in 2013 plunged by 67 per cent from nearly $2million in 2012.","The sale of stock options in 2013 saw Mark Zuckerberg earn $3.3billion .

"By . Martin Samuel . The question for the owners of West Ham United is how long will they allow themselves, and their club, to be made to look ridiculous? It is no longer that West Ham are bad. That could be said of any struggling club in any league in any sport. There are a lot of bad teams about, every year. What is happening at West Ham is bad cubed. Maybe bad to the power of 10. Beyond bad, in fact. There is playing lousy football and going for 11 goals in the space of four days. There is poor form and there is conceding 22 goals over six matches. West Ham look ridiculous. Therefore David Sullivan and David Gold look ridiculous, too. VIDEO Scroll down to see Allardyce rolling with the punches while Redknapp defends him . Contrast: Sam Allardyce (back) looks glum as Manchester City's hat-trick hero Alvaro Negredo walks off . Is time up? Co-owners David Sullivan (left) and David Gold (right) have endured a dismal spell recently . Where does it end? The Championship is the obvious and flippant answer to that but, if West Ham’s fate is to fall from the Premier League, there are months to go before this financially and politically catastrophic consequence occurs. In the meantime, how far becomes too far? How long will the two Davids, as they are known, have to suffer scorelines that are personally and professionally embarrassing before they act? The owners promised a different team, a better team, after the January transfer window but increasingly that appears empty rhetoric. West Ham thought they had Everton reserve John Heitinga — who has started only two games, both in the Capital One Cup, this season — earlier in the January transfer window, but were rebuffed. They thought he had a better offer from a Premier League club, but were wrong there, too. He simply didn’t want to sign for West Ham — and he won’t be the last. It is surely not insignificant that only Roger Johnson, late of twice-relegated Wolverhampton Wanderers and an unsuccessful loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, has rallied to the cause so far. West Ham’s disastrous run is making them the least attractive proposition in the Premier League. At this stage last season, Queens Park Rangers attracted France’s striker Loic Remy. Such a signing could save West Ham’s season, but could the club hope to pull it off now? What player of the necessary quality would join a club who lost 5-0 to Nottingham Forest with the reserves and then 6-0 to Manchester City with the first team? Don’t be ridiculous. So he is a lucky man, Sam Allardyce. Much like England’s cricket coach Andy Flower, he has contrived to collect the plaudits for his management nous in the good times, yet avoided the taint of overwhelming failure in this leanest of years. Thumping: West Ham have shipped 11 goals in two games after losing to Nottingham Forest 5-0 on Sunday . Fed up: One young supporter was captured by ITV cameras in floods of tears at the City Ground . Flower is the man for this crisis, we hear after England’s 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia, which rather ignores that, for such a top-drawer motivator and manager, he entirely failed to anticipate it or reverse the nosedive once it came. The same with Allardyce. He makes great play of his ‘Sam Allardici’ alter ego when results go well, but this present crash is being met with the regular recital of an injury list that, while debilitating, does not represent sufficient mitigation for an almost complete defensive collapse. Looking bleak: West Ham were thumped again as Allardyce's injury-hit side were beaten 6-0 at the Etihad . Unstoppable? Edin Dzeko fires City's sixth goal home in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg . In vain: Allardyce bellows at his players from the bench during the thrashing on Wednesday evening . 'At City, it was almost as if West Ham . accepted their fate with a collective shrug. With full backs and . emergency loanees in the team, what else is there to do but lose 6-0? Quite a lot actually.' Allardyce juxtaposed his free-transfer full back George McCartney having to play in the centre against Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko on Wednesday night and reeled off the injuries to Winston Reid, James Collins and James Tomkins as justification for such a feeble display. Yet West Ham have conceded three goals or more on 10 occasions this season — and in six of those games Allardyce has had two of his front-line centre halves available. Collins and Reid played against Everton on September 21 (lost 3-2), Reid and Tomkins against Manchester City on October 19 (lost 3-1) and Collins and Tomkins faced Norwich City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, conceding a total of 13 goals as a partnership in those four games. Injuries have taken West Ham’s defensive frailty to dismal new levels, but no Premier League team have received such regular batterings this season. Fulham have conceded three or more goals on eight occasions; Sunderland on five, Crystal Palace three. West Ham, remember, 10. In addition to this, it is worth remembering that Chelsea won a Champions League final against Bayern Munich with Jose Bosingwa at centre half. Isn’t that what coaches are supposed to do: re-organise, react or, at least, limit the damage? At City, it was almost as if West Ham accepted their fate with a collective shrug. With full backs and emergency loanees in the team, what else is there to do but lose 6-0? Quite a lot actually. Man for a crisis? England cricket head coach (right) is under fire after a woeful Ashes return . Hope? West Ham's record signing Andy Carroll is nearing fitness again, pictured in training on Thursday . Waiting game: Carroll's lengthy layoff has seen the east-London club struggle for goals . Keeping the tie alive would have been a start. It is hardly edifying for the club to have to adjust ticket prices for the return leg in a forlorn attempt to attract an audience for what should have been one of the most in-demand and eagerly anticipated matches at Upton Park in recent memory. They cannot even sell the game on the presence of world-class opposition. What sort of team will City field on the night? The reserves, with a few first-team players on the bench just in case a couple of early goals go in? That is a tactic that might have served Allardyce better at Nottingham Forest last weekend, when youth followed inexperience into battle, like a bad First World War re-enactment. One that got away: John Heitinga (left) turned down a move to West Ham, who signed Roger Johnson instead . Coup: This time last season, QPR landed Loic Remy (left), but West Ham's chances of a marquee signing to bolster their survival bid look bleaker with every heavy defeat . As embarrassment piles on humiliation for the owners — who have twice broken West Ham’s transfer record on Allardyce’s behalf — removing the manager is no guarantee of survival. Yet neither is keeping him any more. The motivation for maintaining the status quo would appear to be financial — Allardyce’s pay-off is believed to be above £4million — coupled with a perceived shortage of replacements. Yet the same logic saw West Ham sleepwalk over a cliff under Avram Grant in 2011. Big freeze: Mark Noble and Carlton Cole step out of a cryogenic chamber in the wake of the City defeat . Ice man: Carlton Cole still manages to pose for a photo while inside the -135C chamber . Back then, as the void appeared before them, West Ham’s directors skipped a match at Manchester City, which ended in a 2-1 defeat. Had they attended they would have witnessed the moment when a sudden gust of wind in the tunnel scattered Grant’s notes, which he comically struggled to retrieve. ‘Like something out of a Jacques Tati film,’ said a passing cineaste. And, yes, it was a ridiculous sight; but it was never more ridiculous than this.

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson . A mews house in South Kensington, 1963. George Dyer, a petty criminal from the East End of London, drops through the skylight and into a room filled with vast canvases and half completed pictures of naked men and screaming popes. Paint pots and piles of paper scraps carpet the floor. The walls, a makeshift palette, are daubed with gashes of colour – shocking red, pale pink, livid blue. It is the dead of night. A man emerges from the doorway. ‘You’ve got two choices,’ he says matter-of-factly. ‘I can call the police or you can come to bed with me.’ It is Francis Bacon. Portrait Of George Dyer Talking by Francis Bacon (pictured) is due to be auctioned at Christie's in London and is expected to fetch a world-record £40million . George chose the latter option. And so began a near decade-long love affair between the small-time burglar and arguably the greatest British painter of modern times. This week, one of Bacon’s many tributes to George, Portrait Of George Dyer Talking, is expected to become the most expensive single portrait ever auctioned when it  goes on sale at Christie’s in London on Thursday. It is thought the 6ft-tall 1966 oil painting – believed to be being sold by Mexican financier David Martinez Guzman – will fetch up to £40million. It follows the sale of Bacon’s triptych of portraits of fellow artist Lucian Freud, which also set a new world record for an art auction when it fetched £89million last November. Even by the standards of the art world, the latest portrait will set a new reference point – the Beckhams recently paid £40million for their seven-bedroom mansion in London’s exclusive Holland Park. Portrait Of George Dyer Talking is one of the most famous images of Bacon’s lover, a man the artist immortalised on canvas but destroyed in real life. Despite his upbringing on the fringes of the criminal underworld – he was a minor associate of the Krays – George was a fragile young man who was fundamentally ill-equipped to cope with the painter’s cruel brilliance. He committed suicide in Paris in 1971 on the eve of Bacon’s retrospective at the Grand Palais – an honour that had only ever been awarded to one other artist, Picasso. The show included the portrait, which last appeared on the open market in 2000, when it sold for $6.6million (£4million) at Christie’s in New York. It was then believed to have been acquired by Martinez in a private sale for $12million (£7.3million) more than five years ago. Last night, a member of George Dyer’s family spoke for the first time about the artist who some hold responsible for his lover’s death. The relative, a woman in her 80s, who asked not to be named, said: ‘George’s family thought Bacon was a degenerate man and wanted nothing to do with him. Affair: Dyer (left) met Bacon (right) in 1963 while breaking into the artist's house and they began an affair. Dyer was painted several times by Bacon and became his greatest muse . 'He was not liked by the family because we thought he was an awful man. He was horrible. ‘I suppose we had nothing in common with someone like Francis Bacon. But the dislike of him was because of the sort of person he was. That feeling has never changed. Even now, I don’t want to talk about him.’ Bacon, who died in 1992 aged 82, was an alluring but dangerous figure. Michael Peppiatt, author of Francis Bacon, Anatomy Of An Enigma, who was a friend of Bacon, said: ‘Francis was mesmerising, an electrifying presence. 'He was hugely seductive, intuitive, enormously clever. He had this desire to devour people. ‘It was an animal thing. George couldn’t read and write. Someone quipped he learnt how to write when Francis gave him a cheque book. 'George was rather kind, docile even, and that was the problem. Bacon wanted a tough lover who could make him suffer because he was masochistic. 'George was more than 20 years younger and he was too gentle, too nice, even though he came from that background.’ Nevertheless, George became Bacon’s greatest muse. He painted him more than any other person. Through Bacon, George became someone but the psychological impact on him was devastating. Study For Head Of George Dyer (left) and George Dyer Staring Into A Mirror (right) are two other Bacon sketches of his lover who committed suicide aged just 36 before a gallery opening of Bacon's work . Peppiatt said: ‘Someone once said to me, “I can’t think of a worse fate than to be loved by Francis.” Because he left you no air to breathe. 'Bacon gave George an existence but he was absorbed by him. Francis wasn’t a monster. He was caring but he pushed himself to the limits and so he’d do that to other people, too.’ George took refuge in drink and he and his relationship with Bacon began to disintegrate. By the time of the Paris retrospective, they were no longer together. The artist had grown tired of his lover but as he was the inspiration for so many paintings in the exhibition, he felt  it was only right he should be there – as long as he remained sober. Instead, George began drinking the moment they arrived. The day before the exhibition, he was found slumped on the lavatory, with an empty bottle of barbiturates on the floor. He was 36. Bacon was devastated. Peppiatt said: ‘He kept coming back to Paris, even booking into the same hotel. It was as though he needed to be near the scene of the death, to plumb the depths of his feelings and sensations. 'He told me, “There’s not an hour goes by that I don’t think about George and feel profoundly guilty.” ’ Bacon poured his grief into his work, obsessively painting George for years after his death. He had other relationships but no one ever affected him in the way George had.","Francis Bacon had an infamous affair with burglar George Dyer .

"By . Tara Brady . A street in Blackburn has been turned into a fictional sectarian battleground in Belfast during the height of the Northern Ireland troubles. Smoke, armoured cars, a burnt-out bus and rubble filled the streets as 10 days of filming got under way  for the new movie. Other explosive scenes include a man jumping from an upstairs terraced house and a bus explode into a fireball during gritty rioting scenes. The Troubles: Actors film a scene in this back street in Blackburn which became the backdrop to a new film set in Belfast about Northern Ireland in 1971 . Six terraced streets in the town were sealed off to become home to some of British cinema and TV's rising stars as a 65-strong crew films the story of a young Northern British soldier's nightmare journey after separation from his colleagues. The thriller '71' stars 22-year-old actor Jack O'Connell, who played Pukey Nicholls in 'This Is England', Marky in 'Harry Brown', and James Cook in the E4 teen drama Skins. In the film he takes the part of a young British squaddie accidentally abandoned by his unit following a riot on the streets of Belfast in 1971. Unable to tell friend from foe, and wary of his comrades, the raw recruit must survive the night alone and find his way to safety through a disorientating, alien and deadly landscape. An actor with fake blood on his face takes time out of filming on the set of new drama 71 which focuses on a British soldier's nightmare journey during one night in 1970s Belfast after he is separated from his colleagues .

Smoke, armoured cars, a burnt-out bus and rubble filled the streets as 10 days of filming got under way for the new movie . Violence: Six terraced streets in Blackburn were sealed off and transformed into 1970s Belfast for the film starring Jack O'Connell who has been in This is England . The Blackburn streets feature as the daytime start of his horror. Director Angus Lamont said: 'We chose Blackburn because it has the type of Victorian terraced mill-town streets typical of parts of Belfast before the damage and redevelopment caused by the Troubles. The council were very helpful with us.' But local resident Deborah Sengel, 45, who lives just yards from the location said: 'They never said a thing to me about what they were going to be doing and it's really close to my house. 'It's been horrible and my house stinks of smoke. I have even been getting headaches and I put it down to all the fumes coming from when they are burning the bus. 'My cars are filthy and I've even had to put one in the garage. 'They have said that they will pay for our windows to be cleaned but I think they should pay for the cars too. They have offered people on the street money but they told me that they had run out of their budget but will look into it. The film is allegedly costing £7million. Burnt out: Not everyone has been happy about the filming with some residents complaining about noise and smoke .

Conflict: Actors throw stones at a British Army truck in a scene for new drama 71 which is set in 1970s Belfast . ""I can honestly say I feel very disturbed by what I have seen. I have had all the cast sat outside my house and all the army trucks parked up outside. The noise has been terrible and it's been going on until 9.30pm. I honestly never thought I'd be so distressed.' Shopkeeper Irfan Sanje, 46, said: 'It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness this and I think it will plug the town and give it more recognition. 'I'm loving watching it because I take a real interest in films. It's amazing their attention to detail and the effects that are going on. 'The only disappointing thing is that you can't get too close when they are filming. You watch a film and you don't realise all the work that goes into it and what is behind the scenes. This gives us a glimpse of what it is like and how much work is done for a matter of minutes. 'I've seen them re-shoot the same scene over and over again. 'You hear about the troubles and what happened in Belfast to some extent but this really opens the mind up to what it was like back then.' Michelle Lovatt, 42, who works in the street's tanning salon, Mambo's, which is being featured in the film under the new name, Donard's Cafe, said: 'They obviously didn't have sunbed shops in 1971 so we've been made to look like a cafe and they've boarded up all the windows so it is part of the set. Female actors film a scene in Blackburn for new thriller 71 which focuses on a British soldier's fight for survival in 1970's Belfast .

Although the street was transformed into Belfast in the 1970s, neighbours in Blackburn have complained about the noise and disruption during the filming . 'We are having to get the customers come in through the back door when they are filming. I think people think we are closed because we have the burned out bus right outside they think there has been some sort of incident or a bus has crashed. It was good to watch it go up in flames. 'I've been watching them every day and it's been really good. We've had a lot of people coming to have a look and see what's going on too, normally it's a pretty quiet street. 'I think it will be good for the area because its different and we're not used to stuff like this. We've seen them shooting the different scenes and we've had chance to see the rioting and get a feel for what it was like back then with the IRA. 'We've watched the riots between the people and the police and witnessed them throwing water bombs. 'It's a really good location for them to shoot and it's good that the terraced rows are still here but they are getting pulled down after the filming. 'They have been noisy but it's been fun to watch. The actors have been good but there has been some bad language but that is when they are in character. I'm looking forward to seeing it when it has finished.' In 1963, the prime minister of Northern Ireland, Viscount Brookeborough, stepped down after 20 years in office. His long tenure was a produce of the Ulster Unionist domination of politics in the north since partition in 1921. By contrast the Catholic minority had been politically marginalised. This was largely a product of Northern Ireland's two-thirds Protestant majority but was exacerbated by the drawing of local government electoral boundaries to favour unionist candidates. War zone: British soldiers in riot gear detain a man during The Bloody Sunday riots in 1972 Londonderry . Additionally, the right to vote in local government elections was restricted to ratepayers - again favouring Protestants. This bias was preserved by unequal allocation of council houses to Protestant families. Catholic areas also received less government investment than their Protestant neighbours. Police harassment, exclusion from public service appointments and other forms of discrimination were factors of daily life, and the refusal of Catholic political representatives in parliament to recognise partition only increased the community's sense of alienation. But there had been improvements. Post-war Britain's new Labour government had introduced the Welfare State to the north, and it was implemented with few, if any, concessions to old sectarian divisions. In a series of radical moves, he met with the Republic of Ireland's prime minister Sean Lemass - the first such meeting between Irish heads of government for 40 years. This represented a serious threat to many unionists. O'Neill's policies provoked outspoken attacks from within unionism, not least from the Reverend Ian Paisley who rose to prominence at this time. With Catholic hopes raised on one side and unionist fears on the other, the situation quickly threatened to boil over. As a result, Catholic children in the 1950s could reap the benefits of further and higher education for the first time. Viscount Brookeborough was replaced by a former army officer Terence O'Neill who introduced a series of measures to improve the economy. Violence finally erupted in 1966 following the twin 50th anniversaries of the Battle of the Somme and the Easter Rising. Rioting and disorder was followed in May and June by the murders of two Catholics and a Protestant by a 'loyalist' terror group called the Ulster Volunteer Force. O'Neill immediately banned the UVF, but it was too late. The cycle of sectarian bloodletting that would become known as 'the Troubles' had already claimed its first victims.","Smoke, armoured cars, a burnt-out bus and rubble filled the streets as filming got under way for the new movie .

"By . Martin Samuel . You can play Championship Manager. You can be a Zoo Tycoon. But there is no such game as Fantasy Executive Chairman. And do you know why? Because you’ve sort of got power, but you haven’t. The manager: he decides what happens on the football field. He picks the team, he devises the playing strategy, the fans recognise this and, during the good times, sing his name. Star of the show? Or was Nicola Cortese just the Liebherr family's banker at Southampton? The owner: he provides the money. Ultimately, he signs the cheques. He tells the manager who he can buy and for how much. He hires and fires. The executive chairman, or chief executive? Well, ostensibly, he’s in charge; except he never picks the team and his business plan relies entirely on the patronage of a higher authority. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, is supposedly the most powerful man in football. Yet his power only goes so far. Scudamore consistently opposes the loan system but loses whenever he puts the issue to the vote before his Premier League chairmen. He is the boss right up to the point where the people calling the shots say ‘no thank you’. Nicola Cortese found that out this week . when a very rich woman decided she could spend her  fortune, or not, . without his assistance. He really should have known. One of his final . statements as Southampton’s executive chairman spoke of his manager . Mauricio Pochettino in the coldest terms. ‘The manager is basically a department . head like the others,’ he told a Leaders in Football  conference. With a . stunning lack of self-awareness, he forgot that this was all he was, . too. He might have been the head of the department heads but he was an . employee just the same. It wasn’t his money, he merely acted as if it . was. Technically, he is correct about . managers, although he failed to acknowledge that if the head of the . football department fails he takes just about every other department . down with him. It is hard to run an efficient commercial . or financial operation from bottom of the league because revenues will . be affected. Southampton have long had a well-structured and successful . academy; they did not have much opportunity to showcase this, however, . because they kept getting relegated. Then a wonderful person turned up, a true . saviour. Not Cortese but Markus Liebherr, a Swiss  billionaire who had . made his money in crane and construction equipment and was now in the . mood for a little fun. He barely got to have it. Liebherr bought . Southampton on July 8, 2009, removing it from administration, and died . of a heart attack on August 10, 2010. In this brief period he had . installed an ambitious young banker as executive chairman. Cortese had impressed, most recently, at Banque Heritage in Geneva and had a background on the financial side of sport and entertainment. Overhaul: Katharina Liebherr (centre) became Southampton's owner after the death of her father, Markus . Highly-rated: But it remains to be seen if Mauricio Pochettino will be at Southampton after this season . Saviour? Swiss billionaire Markus Liebherr bought Southampton and removed them from administration . After Liebherr’s death, his shattered family pledged to continue supporting Southampton to honour their father’s vision and, as this was to make the club a presence in the Champions League, that meant honouring Cortese’s vision, too. He proved an excellent administrator and Southampton returned to the Premier League through two divisions. Alan Pardew did his bit, and more significantly Nigel Adkins, who won both promotions. Helping hands: Alan Pardew (left) and Nigel Adkins (right) played a role in Southampton's progress . Yet Cortese’s managers never seemed to get much of a mention when he did his interviews. He was part of a new breed: the manager-chairman. He spoke as if Southampton was a one-man show — and he was the star. Occasionally stories would appear linking him with a move to AC Milan or another top club as if he was a player. The first inkling of trouble ahead this week came when those rumours resurfaced on  Monday. And what seemed to be forgotten in all this was that the bill for Cortese’s grand plan — impressive though it was — always landed at the door of Liebherr’s daughter, Katharina. Without her, Cortese might as well have been playing a computer game. One anecdote retold in newspapers on Friday detailed Katharina’s only previous meeting with manager Pochettino before Thursday’s five-minute conversation in the wake of Cortese’s departure. It took place at a dinner for staff and players at the Four Seasons Hotel, arranged by Cortese. Talented squad: But without the necessary investment, Southampton wouldn't have been able to spend . Katharina Liebherr was present too, it was reported. Indeed, because she was paying for it.  Big-hearted Charlie was in the chair as usual, but it was Liebherr money he was spending: £14million to buy the club, £38m in loans converted to equity and £75m on players over five years. Cortese did a fine job but that is all it was, a job. He invested a rich man’s money, as bankers do, for a fee. In the season Southampton returned to the Premier League, Cortese received £1.6m. And Katharina Liebherr may prove to be a dud, by comparison. She may have no interest in football and might no longer feel the emotional pull that existed when her father died; it is now suggested she wants to sell. This would be a great pity. But, as Cortese of all people would . understand, it’s also business. Sometimes rich people like to cash in. As long as she doesn’t want to change the colours to blue, move . Southampton to the Isle of Wight or sell to a crook, that’s her . prerogative. Impressive? Nicola Cortese did a good job at Southampton but needed financial backing to do so . So what happens from here? The prediction was for a tearful exodus of distraught staff and players but Pochettino needed five minutes with his new boss on Thursday to decide he was staying. He will  consider his position at the end of the season, he says, but would have done that anyway. With significant investment needed to secure Champions League football, Southampton will soon hit the glass ceiling. If Pochettino gets a better offer, a . club with greater potential, he may angle to leave. He may even use . Cortese’s departure as his cover story, but it will be a ruse. Few . coaches, and no players, quit over the demise of an executive chairman, . no matter how visionary. Successful youth policy: Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott showed Southampton only needed money to progress . Cortese has been good for Southampton, but his was hardly a lone mission. By the time he arrived in 2009 Theo Walcott was at Arsenal, Gareth Bale was at Tottenham Hotspur, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was established enough to be sold within the year and Adam Lallana had been a professional there since 2006. This was a club with a successful, established youth policy, a strong fan base and a new ground, languishing in League One due to poor financial management. Money restored the natural order, Liebherr money, and Cortese spent it well, as the best bankers do. That’s why billionaires use them.","Former owner Markus Liebherr was Southampton's real saviour .

"By . Allan Hall . Helmut Kohl has admitted that he 'acted like a dictator' to bring the euro into Germany to replace the beloved D-Mark. Germany's longest-serving postwar chancellor said that he would have lost any popular vote on the euro by 'an overwhelming majority'. He said in an interview conducted in 2002 - but only just now published - : 'I knew that I could never win a referendum in Germany. We would have lost a referendum on the introduction of the euro. That's quite clear. I would have lost and by seven to three.' 'I had to be forceful': Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl, pictured above in front of the Brandenburg Gate during a private walk in Berlin, has revealed he 'acted like a dictator' to bring in the euro . The interview was conducted by Jens Peter Paul in 2002 when the Deutsche Mark was subsituted by the euro. Kohl said he adopted the euro as an 'emblem' of the European project which he believed prevented war on the continent. 'If a Chancellor is trying to push something through, he must be a man of power. And if he's smart, he knows when the time is ripe. In one case – the euro – I was like a dictator ... The euro is a synonym for Europe. Europe, for the first time, has no more war,' he went on. What he did NOT address in his interview were the lies he and his ministers told to get the common currency in place across Europe - a decision now seen to have fatal consequences as the continent thrashes around in the sixth year of a financial crisis without end. Friends in Europe: The then-West German chancellor Helmut Kohl pictured in 1989 with the then British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who died yesterday . Hundreds of pages of German government documents from 1994 to 1998 and released last year stated clearly that Italy - now one of the floundering southern European euro states - should NOT have been allowed to join the euroclub. Later on the files bring up another country that was poised for catastrophe: Greece. Aides warned Kohl - who, along with the French relentlessly drove the European Project onwards - that Italy's austerity measures taken at the time were merely 'window dressing.' German media dubbed the information in the files as 'Operation Self Deception.' The German ruling class seemingly knew they were driving the continent into a fiscal cul-de-sac... but went ahead with it anyway. The files show how on February 3, 1997, the German Finance Ministry noted that in Rome 'important structural cost-saving measures were almost completely omitted, out of consideration for the social consensus.' 'The documents that have now been released suggest that the Kohl administration misled both the public and Germany's Federal Constitutional Court,' said news magazine Der Spiegel when they came out last year.","Newly published 2002 interview reveals candid admission about euro project .

"By . Mark Prigg . Tiny sponges could be the unlikely key to saving the victims of gunshot wounds. Researchers have developed a small syringe that can simply be injected into the would. The team behind it say it could save dozens of lives, as it can seal the wound within fifteen seconds. The Xstat, a small syringe of expandable sponges that can simply be injected into a gunshot would to seal it. The key to the system is a specially developed syringe. It can inject dozens of small sponges into the wound. The sponges are coated in a clotting agent and compressed. In the wound, the Xstat sponges expand and create a barrier to blood flow, present a large surface area for clotting. They also provide gentle pressure, freeing up medical staff. 'XStat works by applying a group of small, rapidly-expanding sponges into a wound cavity using a lightweight applicator,' RevMedX, the firm behind the gadget, said. 'In the wound, the Xstat sponges expand and create a barrier to blood flow, present a large surface area for clotting, and provide gentle pressure. No direct manual pressure is required. Two applicator sizes are under development: a 30 mm diameter applicator for larger wounds and a 12 mm diameter applicator for narrow wound tracks. The XStat sponges are made from standard medical sponge that is coated with a hemostatic agent and compressed. The invention already has fans in the US Army. Two applicator sizes are under development: a 30 mm diameter applicator for larger wounds and a 12 mm diameter applicator for narrow wound tracks. 'Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death on the battlefield, and one of our most challenging forms of hemorrhage has been junctional [the junction of the legs or arms with the torso] hemorrhage, or hemorrhage from deep wounds on which it is impossible to put a tourniquet or apply manual compression externally, said Dr. Anthony Pusateri, portfolio manager of the Department of Defense Hemorrhage and Resuscitation Research and Development Program. 'This XSTAT device allows the haemostatic material to be put [injected] into the wound tract, and then it expands from the inside out, putting pressure on the bleeding to stop it,' said Pusateri. 'It is a capability that has never existed before, and can be used in the field setting by medics, possibly even with buddy aid [first aid administered by battlefield 'battle buddies'].' How it works: 'XStat works by applying a group of small, rapidly-expanding sponges into a wound cavity using a lightweight applicator,' RevMedX, the firm behind the gadget, said. 'This project started with the United States Special Operations Command,' he said. 'The research looked promising enough that the Army chose to fund it through its completion.' Pusateri said that he expects that units will be able to purchase the device for themselves. He also believes that the XSTAT device will transcend military medical use and find its way into the field of civilian medicine for widespread public use in trauma scenarios.","Syringe releases small sponges into the wound .

"By . Katy Winter . Guests at a 40th birthday party were stunned when the knees-up turned into a surprise Highland wedding. About 80 friends and members of family at Claire Scott's bash couldn't believe it when her partner David Alldritt dropped to one knee and popped the question. Claire then disappeared and returned in her wedding dress as David's dumbfounded daughters were asked to be bridesmaids and another guest, who is a registrar, married the couple. David Alldritt proposed to Claire Scott in front of shocked guests  on their surprise wedding night in the Highland village of Boat of Garten . Even the bride-to-be's mother and father - who made a 720-mile round trip from England - were clueless about the plan. Paramedic Claire said: 'Everyone was completely delighted and surprised - the atmosphere was really unbelievable. 'When Dave proposed everybody gasped- you could hear the air being taken out of the room, they were really shocked. The pair, who live in Kingussie, had been planning to hold the ceremony at her party for the last two months, revealing the secret to a select few on a 'need to know basis'. The two, here cutting their wedding cake, invited guests to Claire's birthday party and didn't reveal to anyone their plan to marry . David, 53, a telecoms company director, said: 'We didn't tell anybody we didn't have to tell. 'Planning it secretly made it more fun, but it wasn't without its moments of difficulty when people were asking questions about things like dress code and we had to be very careful with the answers. 'We had to tell the hotel staff and they were really cooperative. They were absolutely brilliant and managed to keep the lid on it for us, despite the fact some of the people attending the party were staying there.' The guests arrived at the Nethy Bridge Hotel in Boat of Garten and ate their meal, believing it was just a 40th birthday party for Claire. David Alldritt and Claire Scott, middle, sign the forms after one of their guests, Keith Taylor, who is an accredited local registrar, proclaimed them man and wife . But as soon as they had finished eating, David got down on one knee and proposed - and shocked guests were told that the wedding would be that night. The bride-to-be then went to change into her wedding dress, while David's daughters, Charlotte, 29, Lucy, 25, and Emily, 21, were asked to be bridesmaids. One of their guests, Keith Taylor, of Loch Morlich Watersports, is an accredited local registrar so he did the honours. David said: 'Everybody loved it. They all thought it was well overdue, as we met in 2000, and splendidly done. 'Keeping it secret really added something to the atmosphere.' Claire said that they wanted a 'no-fuss' wedding: 'We realised we should get married but thought that we could do without any of the fuss. 'We planned it a couple of months in advance- we've both been married before so we didn't want anything too stuffy or traditional. (Left to right, back row) Mike Weilding, best man Arthur Matheson, father of the bride Des Scott, Claire Scott, David Aldritt, mother of the bride Janice Scott, and front row: bridesmaids Emily, Charlotte and Lucy Alldritt . The couple, who have been together since 200, said the surprise, low key event was perfect for them . 'I guess since we've been together for such a long time that they never expected to see us actually get married.' But there was no time for a honeymoon after the wedding on Saturday 22nd March, as Claire had to head back to work on Monday morning. The lack of wedding presents also didn't faze her: 'It wasn't about presents, we were just glad for the chance to celebrate and make (our relationship) official.' Mother of the bride Janice Scott, 68, who travelled up from Cheshire with husband Des, said: 'We always assumed that they, like a lot of couples these days, would just never get married. 'It certainly came as a pleasant surprise when David got down on one knee and proposed. 'I still wasn't very surprised until Claire said that the wedding would be that night!' She praised her husband's impromptu speech, saying: 'He actually gave quite a good speech in the end. He was quite nervous but said that it went better than if he had rehearsed it. 'It was a really lovely night and when Claire changed into her wedding dress she looked really beautiful.' Guests were delighted in the sudden change in plans for their evening,  enjoying a spot of dancing after the ceremony . Father Des, 71, said he had about five minutes to write his speech: 'The best man came up to me and said that it was usual in weddings for guests to make a speech on a wedding. 'I just thought 'in for a penny, in for a pound', spent about five minutes writing it and just gave it my all. 'The funny thing is that I can't remember a word of it now, but Dave and my daughter came up afterwards and thanked me so it must have been alright. 'It was certainly a shock but we were really happy for them... the best part was that I didn't have to pay.' Guest David Craig said everyone was amazed that the couple had managed to keep the wedding a secret. He said: 'The joy and excitement of the happy couple was shared by all friends and family, who were truly privileged to be part of Claire and Dave's very special fairytale wedding.'","David and Claire have been together since 2000 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . It is the first time since the American Civil War 150 years ago that the laborious method of tintype photography has been used in the battlefield. When U.S. Air Force gunner (and photographer) Ed Drew was posted to Afghanistan this summer, he decided to capture his fellow soldiers not with a modern camera but using an outdated technique called tintype, resulting in a haunting series of pictures reminiscent of those taken by photographer Matthew Brady in the 1861-1865 Civil War. Drew, a staff sergeant in the California Air National Guard, was in Helmand Province when he took the photographs using tintype photography, a process involving chemicals which is as time-consuming as it is fiddly, with each image taking several minutes to create. The tintypes were created by aerial gunner Ed Drew during time on the ground between sorties - this photograph shows a technical sergeant based in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, earlier this year . The tintypes were created by aerial gunner Ed Drew during time on the ground between sorties - this photograph shows a technical sergeant based in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, earlier this year . Brooklyn-born Drew, 32, would often have to drop his work and run to the helicopter when he was summoned on an urgent mission in his work on a Combat Search and Rescue special operations helicopter. Creating each image involved hand-pouring a chemical called collodion onto a sheet of metal which is made light-sensitive with a silver nitrate solution and then creating a direct positive onto it. A painstaking process with the wet plates, making tintypes was made harder still for Drew by the dry and dusty conditions in Helmand Province. Drew, who grew up in New York City and joined the U.S. Air Force a month after graduating high school, served in Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas and then Yokota Air Base near Tokyo. He says it was during his time in Japan that he discovered a passion for art, and then left the military, travelling around Europe for years and developing his artistic style. In 2008, Drew returned to America and enlisted in the Air National Guard. Now living in San Francisco's Bay Area, he studies sculpture and also serves as a reserve aerial gunner as a defensive heavy weapons and tactics specialist. His work is reminiscent of that done by American war photographer Matthew Brady, who used the same method to take photographs of soldiers in battlefields around the country including Gettysburg during the bloody war 150 years ago. Risking their lives in hostile territory: This glamorous soldier is a major and co-pilot who served alongside Brooklyn-born Ed Drew in Helmand Province earlier this year . Drew's tintype photographs are reminiscent of those taken in the American Civil War, such as that of the corporal, left, and the volunteer, right, dating back to the 1860s . This tintype photograph shows a Sikorsky HH60G Pave Hawk combat search and rescue helicopter - the photographer would often drop everything and run to it . The stresses of combat, lack of basic materials, drying desert air, and the wind and dust of Afghanistan challenged Drew's artistic ability - this image shows a pilot . Drew said he chose the tintype method as he wanted to show the humanity behind the people involved in the horrors of war - this photograph shows a senior airman mechanic . On active duty: This lined tintype image shows a staff sergeant pararescueman who was deployed in Afghanistan alongside Drew in June this year . Old-fashioned method: The tintype method of photography has not been used in a combat zone since the American Civil War more than a century ago . The stark photographs challenge the viewer to look for longer, possessing an historical quality that adds resonance to the subject - this photograph depicts a pilot . The photographer, who was born in Brooklyn and grew up in New York City, now lives in San Francisco's Bay Area, where he is studying sculpture - this image shows a technical sergeant and aerial gunner . The tintype technique was last used on the battlefield in the Civil War by photographer Matthew Brady, whose fascinating portrait of soldier in the 19th century are well-known . The portraits show soldiers during the bloody conflict in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, and offer an alternative view of those involved in the war . This technical sergeant in the U.S. Air Force was serving in Helmand this summer when Drew persuaded him to sit for a tintype photograph - he chose to pose with his gun .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Restoring lost senses to amputees is something that has, until now, only been considered as science fiction. But Dennis Sorensen from Denmark is living proof that working appendages can reinstate senses as complicated as 'feeling'. The incredible technology, revealed by MailOnline last year, is the first bionic hand that allows the user to feel the sensation of touch though the device. The 36-year-old was fitted with the robotic limb, known as Lifehand 2, in Rome on January 26 2013 but the medical breakthrough has only now been shared. Dennis Sorensen of Denmark (left) has become the first amputee to be fitted with a bionic hand (right) that allows him to feel what he is touching in a groundbreaking medical procedure . 'The sensory feedback was incredible,' said Mr Sorensen, who spent a month trying out the hand. 'I could feel things that I hadn't been able to feel in over nine years. 'When I held an object, I could feel if it was soft or hard, round or square.' Mr Sorensen had his hand blown off in an horrific New Year's Eve firework accident at a neighbour's house in Aalborg, Denmark, where he still lives. Since then he has been wearing a . conventional prosthesis that detects muscle movement in the stump of his . arm, allowing him to open and close his hand and grasp objects. But . without sensory information he cannot feel what he is trying to grasp, . making it difficult to gauge the amount of pressure needed. He now has to cope with the psychological challenge of having re-experienced a sense of touch only to lose it again. 'I was more than happy to volunteer for the clinical trial, not only for myself, but to help other amputees as well,' he said. The 36-year-old underwent the procedure to fit the arm at Gemelli Hospital in Rome, the first such medical procedure of its kind and a breakthrough in bionic limbs . In a laboratory wearing a blindfold and earplugs Mr Sorensen was able to detect the strength of his grasp as well as the shape and consistency of the different objects he picked up . The groundbreaking work was carried out by Dr Silvestro Micera and her team from the Federal Polytechnique School of . Lausanne in Switzerland. Mr Sorenson was taking part in a trial of the technology at Gemelli Hospital in Rome conducted by the Swiss and Italian scientists who developed the experimental prosthetic hand. The nerves in the amputee's arm are attached to electrode relays in the hand to control movement . The artificial hand detects information about touch using electrical signals from artificial tendons controlling finger movement. Fine wires send the digitally refined impulses to four electrodes implanted in the sensory ulnar and median nerves of the upper arm. 'This is the first time in neuroprosthetics that sensory feedback has been restored and used by an amputee in real-time to control an artificial limb,"" said Dr Silvestro Micera . Mr Sorensen had the hand fitted on . January 26 2013 but due to clinical trial safety rules, the sensory . electrodes had to be removed from his arm after one month. However the scientists believe they would continue to function without damaging the nervous system for many years. The results of the study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, are the first step towards a true bionic hand which can feel as well as move, say the scientists. However, they point out that it will be years before such a device becomes commercially available. A robotic device invented by engineering students at the University of Pennsylvania could help its wearer carry an additional 40 pounds (18 kg). The robot arm would make lifting a heavy suitcase feel as easy . as lifting a cup of tea. Titan .

"By . Mark Duell . A top scientist who emigrated to Britain from New Zealand to pursue her dream job hanged herself after struggling with loneliness and homesickness, an inquest has heard. Dr Isobel Maxwell-Cameron had just gained an organic chemistry research post at the University of Manchester - but struggled when laboratory experiments failed and found it was not the job for her. After a failed suicide attempt, the 25-year-old - who had a history of depression - was found dead in the bathroom of her apartment in Salford when her mother alerted Greater Manchester Police. Death: Dr Isobel Maxwell-Cameron, 25, had just gained an organic chemistry research post in Manchester . She had been due to start a new project management role in the research group just two days later, and left a ‘to-do’ list on the kitchen table - which included taking her hamster back to the pet shop and discussing her work future. Dr Maxwell-Cameron excelled in her studies and received a PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Otago in her home town of Auckland in October 2013 and decided to emigrate 11,500 miles to the UK to further her career. She travelled to the Republic of Ireland with her research group to deliver a presentation at the prestigious University of Dublin which was extremely well received. Outside work, Dr Maxwell-Cameron enjoyed karate, rowing, acrobatics and fire dancing - but she struggled with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, depression and anxiety for a number of years, and was receiving treatment. At an inquest in Bolton, Greater Manchester, a statement was read from her mother Priscilla Cameron, who was unable to fly over from New Zealand. She said Dr Maxwell-Cameron never did things by halves, but wanted to come back to New Zealand due to struggles with work and the recent death of her grandfather in the country. Mrs Cameron added: ‘She was passionate about science. When she got the job in England she was so anxious about moving from a small city to a large city on the other side of the world. But she was very outgoing and friendly and expecting to make new friends. ‘She managed her depression by always having a hobby outside of study. Some family friends knew about her struggles but others didn’t. She had a great sense of humour and fun.’ Despite protestations from her family, Dr Maxwell-Cameron chose to live alone in England and after her grandfather died in November last year, would regularly tell her mother over phone or Skype that she was suffering badly from depression. She had tried to hang herself on January 5, but failed.  She then continued to work the following week without mentioning to colleagues the personal turmoil she was enduring and appeared to be ‘very friendly, lively and bubbly’ when they went out for a drink. Change: The 25-year-old moved from Auckland (left) in New Zealand to Salford (right) in Greater Manchester . Mrs Cameron said: ‘She was alone at Christmas, she seemed a bit low. On January 6 she called me to say she had tried to hang herself the night before. I didn’t realise how quickly she could go to that. ‘She said she was feeling the worse she had ever felt.’ She saw a psychiatrist after contacting her mother and was prescribed anti-depressants which seemed to be working. Mrs Cameron said: ‘She found high failure rates in experimental work difficult to deal with. She then got offered work outside the lab. ‘On Saturday evening she was down again . and wanting to come home. I was surprised by her rapid switch and told . her not to rush decisions. The offer of different work seemed like a . good start.’ 'She called me to say she had tried to hang herself the night before. I didn’t realise how quickly she could go to that' Priscilla Cameron, mother . Mrs Cameron offered to call her daughter on Saturday night, New Zealand time, but she declined, saying a mental health crisis team were paying her a visit in the morning. After calling and texting her daughter the following day with no response, Mrs Cameron called Greater Manchester Police suspecting the worse, and an officer discovered her body that night on January 11. Her mother added: ‘I regret not encouraging her to come home and not calling her on Saturday night.’ Healthcare support worker Wendy Higham, who was helping counsel Dr Maxwell-Cameron after her failed suicide attempt, visited her apartment on the day of her death. Miss Higham said: ‘She was very warm and pleasant. She invited me in and asked me to sit down. She said she had plans for the evening to watch some TV and so some knitting. ‘She was saying the next day she might start going to the gym. There was no change from when I saw her the day before. We fixed a meeting for her to see my colleague the following afternoon.’ Science: Dr Maxwell-Cameron had been due to start a new project management role in her research group at the University of Manchester (pictured) just two days after her death . Recording a narrative verdict, Manchester West Coroner Alan Walsh said: ‘She was a very well-educated, intelligent woman and appears to have been a very outgoing person with friends. ‘From the evidence I have heard, even though it may have been different in her mind she appears to have been working very well and was successful within the research team. ‘I accept that she was uncertain about her future in chemistry and she was a little disillusioned with regard to her chosen discipline and also the fact of her involvement with a research team within that discipline. 'I find her death to be an enormous tragedy. A young, talented, intelligent, vibrant young lady who came to England from New Zealand believing she was going to further her education by contributing in terms of research to projects that might benefit others' Alan Walsh, Manchester West Coroner . ‘She would go out for a drink and when she was out she was vibrant and someone who was part of the social gathering but more than that very alive in the way she enjoyed herself. ‘Her colleagues thought something was not quite right but were not aware of her previous medical history. She had a previous history of diagnosed depression. ‘She didn’t talk about depression to her work colleagues or those she socialised with. She didn’t warn anybody about what she was about to do and there was no contact with her mother which is significant in my mind. ‘The attempt on the 5th was a spontaneous act at night when she was on her own. That is not dissimilar to what happened on the 11th. In these lonely times and lonely occasions at night the depression would be a factor that is important. ‘I find her death to be an enormous tragedy. A young, talented, intelligent, vibrant young lady who came to England from New Zealand believing she was going to further her education by contributing in terms of research to projects that might benefit others. ‘For her to die in these circumstances in an apartment in Salford is something that would have been beyond the imagination of her family in New Zealand. It is a tragedy of utmost proportion. I am greatly saddened by the loss of such talent.’","Isobel Maxwell-Cameron had just gained organic chemistry research post .

"By . Lydia Warren . A woman witnessed instant karma after a pickup truck driver aggressively tailgated her, flipped her off and then sped in front of her - before losing control and smashing into a pole. And even better for the woman, Tracy Lynn Sloan, she caught the whole thing on camera - which allowed police to swiftly arrest the driver, 33-year-old Jeffrey Travis White. Sloan shared the video on YouTube and explained that she was driving along US 41 in Tampa, Florida on Monday morning when the 2008 Ford pickup truck neared her. Scroll down for video . Threatening: Tracy Sloan began recording when this pickup started driving right behind her on Monday . Rage: Jeffrey White can be seen flipping her off as he drives past and ahead of her on US 41 in Tampa . 'This pathetic excuse for a human . being tailgated me for about three minutes,' she wrote. 'After about a . minute, and me shaking my head, I pulled out my phone and started . recording. 'I couldn't move over because there were trucks in the right . lane, and I sure as heck wasn't going to speed on a rainy day with the . roads being as slick as they were.' After another minute, he passed her and flashed her his middle finger before eventually speeding up and cutting left in front of her. But as he increased his speed, he lost control of the vehicle and crossed into the lane of oncoming traffic. Losing control: She captures him as he pulls in front of her but begins swerving on the wet road . Danger: He begins swerving into the lane of oncoming traffic before hitting the grass - as Sloan films . Oops: As Sloan laughs, White's truck is pictured crashed on the side of the road after hitting a light pole .

Arrest: Jeffrey White, 33, faces charges of careless driving and failing to wear a seat belt . 'That's what you get!' Sloan shouts as she drives past the wreck, laughing. 'All on video buddy!' She added beneath the video: 'I've recorded circumstances like this before, catching idiots doing stupid things, but never ever had this happen.' White initially left the scene but when Sloan handed over video to authorities, they were able to identify him with the footage and witness accounts to catch up with him. 'This moron could have easily killed . somebody with his moronic behavior, and my laughing at the end would . have been replaced with tears,' she wrote. 'Needless to say though, I've never seen . Karma come back so fast.' White was arrested at his home on Wednesday and faces charges of leaving the . scene of a traffic crash, careless driving and failing to wear his seat . belt, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Records show White has an arrest record . that includes old charges of battery and marijuana possession, the Times reported. He was . arrested in 2002 and charged with disorderly conduct.

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren . Crews are continuing their frantic search for dozens of victims still missing after Saturday's landslide in Washington - but authorities say they may have to leave some bodies buried. Search crews using dogs, bulldozers . and their bare hands are slogging through the mess of broken wood and . mud, looking for more bodies or anyone who might still . be alive nearly five days after a wall of fast-moving earth destroyed a . small rural community. Authorities have said that recovering every corpse would be impractical and dangerous - and now families are being forced to accept that their loved ones might never be found. The . debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places, . with a moon-like surface that includes quicksand-like muck, . rain-slickened mud and ice. The terrain is difficult to navigate on foot . and makes it treacherous or impossible to bring in heavy equipment. Scroll down for video . Hunt: Searchers watch as a piece of heavy equipment moves debris at the scene of the deadly mudslide on Wednesday, as authorities warn that bodies of some victims may never be recovered .

Sadness: Snohomish County Fire Chief Steve Mason (left) talks with a chaplain near the mudslide near Oso, Washington as efforts continued to find victims. The death toll now stands at 24 . To . make matters worse, the pile is laced with other hazards that include . fallen trees, propane and septic tanks, twisted vehicles and countless . shards of shattered homes. 'We . have to get on with our lives at some point,' said Becky Bach, who has spent . the past several days in the area in hopes that searchers would find her . brother, his wife, her 20-year-old great niece and the young girl's . fiance. Sixteen bodies have . been recovered, but authorities believe at least 24 people were killed. Scores of others are still unaccounted for, although many of those . names were believed to be duplicates. Doug . Massingale is among those waiting for word about his 4-month-old . granddaughter. Searchers were able to identify carpet from the infant's . bedroom, but a log jam stood in the way of a more thorough effort to . find little Sanoah Huestis, known as 'Snowy'. Helping hand: Derek Stephani, an electrician, drove up to volunteer to find slide victims in Oso . Team: Searchers prepare to begin looking through a debris field as a destroyed home stands behind . Holding out hope: Searcher Shayne Barco and his dog Stratus look through debris on Tuesday . Doing his duty: Search dog Stratus leaps through a debris field while working with a handler . 'It . just generates so many questions if they don't find them,' Bach said. 'I've never known anybody to die in a natural disaster. Do they issue . death certificates?' 'Realistically...I honestly don't think . they're going to find them alive. But as a family, we're trying to . figure out what to do if they find no bodies.' Bach . spoke via phone about a wedding the family had planned for summer at . the rural home that was destroyed. And how, she wondered, do you plan a . funeral without a body? 'We'll probably just have a memorial, and if they find the bodies eventually, then we'll deal with that then,' she said. In previous mudslides, many victims . were left where they perished. Mudslides killed thousands in Venezuela . in 1999, and about 1,500 bodies were found. But the death toll was . estimated at 5,000 to 30,000, so the government declared entire . neighborhoods 'memorial grounds'.

Before and after: This combination of images provided by NASA shows the Oso area on Jan. 18 (top) and March 23 (bottom) following the landslide. An area north of the river can be seen entirely collapsed . As families grieved, officials were . questioned again Wednesday about warnings from years ago that showed the . potential for catastrophic landslides in the area. A . 1999 report by geomorphologist Daniel Miller raised questions about why . residents were allowed to build homes in the area and whether officials . had taken proper precautions. Snohomish . County Emergency Management Director John Pennington said authorities . took steps to mitigate risks after a 2006 landslide and told residents . about potential hazards. But the sheer size of this disaster was . overwhelming. 'It haunts . me,' a sometimes-emotional Pennington told reporters. 'I think we did . what we could do. Sometimes large slides happen.' Devastated: Teresa Welter cries as she holds a candel at a candlelight vigil in Arlington, Washington on Tuesday night for the victims of Saturday's massive landslide. Scores of people are still missing . Together: People gather at a candlelight vigil in Arlington to pray for victims on Tuesday night .

He . said the landslide risk has been high this winter, and the Department . of Natural Resources put out warnings on a routine basis. Officials will try to learn from this tragedy, he said. Meanwhile, hundreds of rescuers kept slogging through the muck, following search dogs over the unstable surface of the immense pile. For the last three days, 'the most effective tool has been dogs and just our bare hands and shovels uncovering people,' Snohomish County District 21 Fire Chief Travis Hots said. 'But the dogs are the ones that are pinpointing a particular area to look, and we're looking and that's how we're finding people.' Loss: Linda McPherson, 69, (left) and four-month-old Sanoah Huestis, right, are among the victims . Waiting: Jonielle Spillings, right, and her son Jacob, center, are safe, but his siblings (from left) Kaylee, baby Brooke and Jovon and father Billy (second right) were at home and have not been found . Massingale said he's grateful that his daughter, Natasha Huestis, survived the slide. She had gone to Arlington that morning and left her baby with her mother, Christina Jefferds. Her husband Seth, a volunteer firefighter, was also away at the time. 'She didn't suffer,' Massingale said after he was told about Christina's death. Massingale said he would miss his first grandchild, a sweet, pretty and smiley child. 'It's stressful to think about,' he said. 'A little baby that hasn't gotten a start yet in life.

She was joined by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers (right) 'Sam Cam has made it no secret that Roksanda is one of her favourite London-based designers, wearing her dresses to meet the First Lady and to various events with her husband. 'This particular dress is from Roksanda’s Resort 2014 collection, which is now on sale, and retails for over £1000. 'Historically, a designer’s Resort collection (also known as Cruise or Holiday) was aimed at their wealthiest clients, those who enjoyed taking a cruise for their summer holiday. 'Nowadays, it is expected for designers to design a resort range as part of their four seasonal collections. And often the Resort collections are those that are most sold.' Favourite designer: Samantha often champions the Serbian-born designer, who is also loved by the Duchess of Cambridge . Support: Former model Jemma Kidd alongside her husband Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington (left). Also in attendance were actress Joan Collins and financial services entrepreneur Ivan Massow (right) This isn't the first time that Mrs Cameron has donned the designer's clothes and she is not alone in her love of the label - the Duchess of Cambridge . and Michelle Obama have also worn Roksanda’s creations. She may be Serbian by blood, but Roksanda Ilincic has been resolutely embraced as one of our own. The London-based designer has risen swiftly and steeply through fashion's ranks since settling in the capital in 1999. And . her ascent has been assisted by some extremely important women, all of . whom have been busy filling their wardrobes with her vibrant colours and . statement dresses. Remember this one? Samantha Cameron wore a turquoise and hot pink creation straight off Roksanda Ilincic's spring/summer 2012 catwalk as she hosted a reception celebrating British fashion . Simple elegance: The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of Roksanda Ilincic, too . Royalty of the genuine, political and Hollywood variety have all demonstrated their fondness for Ilincic's idiosyncratic and ever-elegant creations. The Duchess . of Cambridge, Princess Beatrice, Michelle Obama and . Tilda Swinton are just some of the sartorially clued-up women to . appreciate her bold colour-blocking and clean, unfussy lines. Ilincic - who has confessed to being . fanatical about Yves Saint Laurent and having some 500 of the brand's . vintage pieces - must be used to spotting celebrities wearing her . creations by now. Princess Beatrice stepped out wearing . her delicious, long-sleeved peach frock - complete with appropriately . royal blue sleeve tips - at a recent event. And Hollywood royalty including Penelope Cruz, Emma Stone, Keira . Knightley and Gwyneth Paltrow have all been photographed in her dresses, which cost from £300 to over £1,000.

Ilincic, who lives in north London with her husband  Philip Bueno de Mesquita and toddler daughter Efimia, designs four womenswear collections per year. The former model - who yearned . to be a ballet dancer when she was growing up, but felt 'too tall and . awkward' - moved to London to study design after reading about Louise . Wilson, a teacher at Central Saint Martins. She . thought to herself: 'If all those big-name designers are coming out of . the same college, something amazing must be happening.' The designer: Roksanda Ilincic, who was born in Serbia but has made London her home since 1999 . She recently made her . creations accessible to even more women (and also little girls), designing an . affordable range for high-street department store Debenhams, and a . unique designer line for children. Her children's line, Blossom, is a selection of pretty dresses, stretchy tops and bold colours, made for two to eight-year-olds. The designer plans to create two Blossom . collections per year, with items on sale at Liberty and on . AlexandAlexa.com, priced between £135 and £270.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Dogs are usually regarded as man's best friend - but for big cat lover Rafael Villafane it's his pet jaguar instead. Rafael, 50, has been caring for Maya, his 175lb feline for the past four years. The music producer feeds Maya, who loves gorging on 2.5kg of organic turkey, fish, beef, deer and wild boar every day. To keep her fit and active he takes her for walks and even visits public restaurants with Maya by his side. Scroll down for video . 'We have a strong bond': Mexican music producer Rafael Villafane hangs out with his pet Jaguar whom he has looked after for the last four years at his home in Mexico City . Dining out: Rafael loves visiting his favourite restaurant and ties Maya on her lead around a tree - just feet away from other customers . The pair often visit the park near his home in Mexico City, Mexico, where he walks the huge predator and lets her swim in the river. After her exercise, Rafael loves visiting his favourite restaurant and ties Maya on her lead around a tree - just feet away from the tables and other customers. At home, Rafael plays with Maya - tumbling and wrestling with her on the ground to keep her in shape and stimulated. Rafael said: 'I know that she could grab my head in a second and kill me. 'She has all her claws and teeth, and she's incredibly powerful. 'I'm aware of the dangers of course, I realise she's a jaguar - but we have a strong bond and I really don't feel any danger around her. 'Once I saw her as a little cub, I fell in love with her.' Present: Rafael was given Maya as a gift from a friend and he originally intended to release her into the wild . 'I'm aware of the dangers': Rafael plays with Maya - tumbling and wrestling with her on the ground to keep her in shape and stimulated . Affection: For three months after he was first given Maya, Rafael spent eight unbroken hours with her every day, so she would get familiar with him . Rafael was given Maya as a gift from a friend and he originally intended to release her into the wild. Rafael said: 'My friend bought Maya from a jaguar breeder, naively thinking we could free her in a reserve in the Mayan Forest in the southern part of Mexico.' But he soon realised she was unlikely to survive in her natural habitat because animals born in captivity lack hunting and survival skills. Rafael said: 'A wild jaguar is scared of people and would run away from them. 'Maya will go up to people and check them out because she's been around people all her life. 'She would have sought human contact and would have ended up as a rug somewhere due to human poaching.' Maya lives in a custom enclosure built on the hillside of Rafael's home. Walkies: Rafael realised Maya was unlikely to survive in her natural habitat because animals born in captivity lack hunting and survival skills . Play time: The pair often visit the park near his home in Mexico City, Mexico, where he walks the huge predator and lets her swim in the river . Her living quarters cost Rafael about $50,000 and took nearly a year to build. It spans 4,000 square feet and includes a sleeping area, a giant litter box, and an observation deck with a very low fence s she can see out. 'Jaguars like to be high up, they like to dominate whatever is below them - so she likes to enjoy the view from up on her observation deck,' added Rafael. 'I'm always with her when she's up there though.' For three months after he was first given Maya, Rafael spent eight unbroken hours with her every day, so she would get familiar with him. 'In the beginning she would growl at me if I got too close,' he said. 'But the fact that I can sit with her on the ground is showing her that I trust her, so she trusts me back. 'She has bit me and scratched me - but it's all in play, it's never been an aggressive attack. 'I have a strong bond with her - she's like my best friend. I feel no danger or fear, and I'm sure she doesn't either because of the way she acts with me.' Rafael's is one of several stories which appear in new Animal Planet series Preposterous Pets which starts on Thursday, April 3 at 8pm.","Rafael Villafane, from Mexico City, describes Maya as his 'best friend'

"By . Associated Press . Many of the exhausted dogs that have been in . search of victims of the deadly mudslide that buried a mountainside Washington . community will take a two-day break as the official death toll rose from 18 to 21. The dogs can lose their sensing ability if overworked in the cold and rain. ‘The . conditions on the slide field are difficult, so this is just a time to . take care of the dogs,’ said Kris Rietmann, a spokeswoman for the team . working on the eastern portion of the slide, which hit March 22 about 55 . miles northeast of Seattle and is one of the deadliest in U.S. history. Needed rest: Rescue dog Tryon, muddied from the day's work, stands with his handler near the west side of the mudslide on Highway 530 near mile marker 37  in Arlington, Washington. Dogs like Tryon have been given a two-day break from work because days of intense searching can dull their senses . Dogs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that arrived more recently will continue working. Fifteen of the victims have been identified by the Snohomish County medical examiner, and six have yet to be identified, Biermann said. Another four bodies were found in the debris field on Sunday, but they won't be added to the official count until the medical examiner receives the bodies. Biermann said 30 people remain missing. Authorities have said the task of finding and identifying victims from the debris field has been extremely challenging, and not all may ultimately be recovered. Dirty job: Rescue dog Nexus, muddy from working onsite, waits to be decontaminated via hose. He's one of many that helped uncover four more bodies over the weekend . Slog: Periods of rain and wind have hampered efforts for days and constant exposure to the conditions can hurt dogs' ability to sense victims . Holding strong: Search and rescue teams navigate the wet, muddy terrain at the west side of the mudslide. While some dogs will be given a break, others will continue working in the unforgiving conditions over the next two days . Rescue dog Nexus, muddy from working onsite, strolls the staging area at the west side of the mudslide . FEMA dogs that were brought in more recently will continue to work as the local rescue dogs that have been searching for days will get a break . Crews have completed a makeshift road that will link one side of the debris field to the other, significantly aiding the recovery operation. They have also been working to clear mud and debris from the highway, leaving piles of gooey muck, splintered wood and housing insulation on the sides of the road. Searchers have had to contend with treacherous conditions, including septic tanks, gasoline and propane containers. When rescuers and dogs leave the site, they are hosed off by hazardous materials crews. The slide dammed up the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, causing water to pool up on the east side. The river cut a new channel through the mud, but the rain has raised the water level nearly a foot, Rietmann said. In at least one place, the water level got so high that it covered areas that have already been searched, said Tim Pierce, leader of Washington Task Force 1, a search-and-rescue team. ‘At this point, there's no point in searching (that area) again until the water drops back down,’ he said. Rescuers should get some relief soon. Conditions were improving Sunday, and mainly dry weather is forecast Monday through Wednesday in western Washington. Devotion: The congregation of the Glad Tidings Assembly of God church in Darrington sings Sunday during morning church services . Staying strong: Much of the music and speaking at Sunday's service was devoted to reaction to the deadly mudslide that hit the nearby community of Oso . The size of the debris field is also smaller than initially thought, officials said Sunday. After review and analysis, geologists have determined it is about 300 acres — just under half the size of an earlier projection of 1 square mile. Away from the whirring chain saws and roaring bulldozers, many residents of nearby Darrington sought comfort in church services. ‘I can only compare it to a hot, hearty meal after a very cold day,’ said Slava Botamanenko, who works at the hospital in Arlington. He said he spent two nights there to be sure he was available for work after the mudslide blocked the road. All week, a steady stream of people has stopped in to pray at the Glad Tidings Assembly of God on the edge of town, said Lee Hagen, the senior pastor. ‘At a time like this, everybody knows they've got to have God's help,’ he said. Tough times: Search and rescue teams navigate the wet, muddy terrain at the west side of the mudslide. Soggy conditions have made the search effort difficult for both humans and dogs . Remembering what's important: An American flag pulled from the debris hangs in the staging area . Reaching out: Randy Fay, a volunteer rescue technician with Snohomish County's SnoHawk 10 rescue helicopter, helps Jetty Dooper, from the Netherlands . Terrible conditions: Search and rescue teams walk through a field of mud on a path of plywood at the west side of the mudslide . Evidence of tragedy: Assorted broken debris sits on a muddy suitcase pulled from the scene at the west side of the mudslide on Sunday . In it together: A sheriff chaplain offers a few words to a rescue worker as he enters the decontamination tent area . Firefighters navigate through downed trees as they carry shovels in the muck on Sunday . Country singer Susie McEntire, sister of Reba, performed for the congregation Sunday, crooning: ‘You'll get through this and you'll break new ground.’ At the St. John Mary Vianney Catholic church a few blocks away, Father Tim Sauer said: ‘Bless our communities, bless our people, bless our valley.’ The Rev. Owen Couch, a chaplain for the fire district in Darrington, said he's worried about the first responders. ‘My concern is when this slows down and they're not going full tilt, and they have time to kind of reflect on what they've seen and what they've done,’ he said. ‘That's when the critical incident stress starts to kick in.’ Steve Huot, lead chaplain for the Arlington Fire Department, said he is seeing people in various states. Some are in shock, while others have begun to grasp the reality of the disaster. Many are exhausted. ‘It's more about listening right now. You need to encourage them and maybe change their focus to staying busy for the group, for the team,’ he said.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . Sheffield has topped a list of Britain's happiest cities - with a third of the population saying they wake up with a smile on their face every day. Tellingly, those polled ranked sex highly on the list of factors that keep them feeling upbeat, along with doing good deeds for others, spending time with family and being given a compliment. The South Yorkshire steel centre beat southern spots including London, Bristol and popular seaside resort Brighton to the number one position. Shiny happy Sheffield: The south Yorkshire city beat major tourist destinations including London and Edinburgh to top the poll . Upbeat: Sheffield has topped a poll of the happiest places in Britain, with a third of the population saying they feel upbeat every day . Edinburgh was second on the list of the happiest cities, beating Brighton into third and the Welsh capital Cardiff into fourth position. Other Scottish cities fared less well, with the study indicating that only 16 per cent of people in Glasgow feel good daily. People in Norwich, which came in 13th place, rated sex highest on their list of factors that keep them feeling good seven days a week, with 43 per cent of people citing its importance - twice as many as in Belfast. The study, commissioned by Transform Cosmetic Surgery Group, revealed 61 per cent of Britons say doing something nice for another person is what makes them feel good. A substantial 72 per cent of people in the happiest city of Sheffield said doing good deeds puts them in a better mood. Feeling capital: Edinburgh came second in the poll, beating Cardiff, London and Belfast . Grey days: Bristol, in the South West, only managed 15th place on the list of the happiest cities in Britain . In Manchester 60.9 per cent of people said the same, while 62.8 per cent of the population of Southampton said it was important to put other people's needs first in order to retain a sunny demeanour. A total of 20.8 per cent of those surveyed said they felt at their best on a Saturday. But the study also revealed a quarter of Britons never feel good about themselves. When asked to state the situation most likely to make them lose their confidence, over 25 per cent said looking at their own reflection. Feel-good factor: This graphic reveals the nation's happiest locations - and those where people's spirits are a little less sunny . Other situations likely to have a negative impact on a person's confidence were dealing with bank or utility companies, the study showed. It suggested people's confidence peaks during the 24 to 35 age bracket. A spokesman for Transform said: 'Although itâ€™s upsetting that still so many of us feel so low on a regular occurrence and how little confidence we have, itâ€™s refreshing to hear that confidence levels are on the up for the majority of us.'","A third of people in Sheffield feel upbeat every single day, survey shows .

"By . Lizzie Parry . He is the man behind the popular 5:2 diet. But despite championing the phenomenon known as The Fast Diet, Dr Michael Mosley has decided to try out another, historical way to shed the pounds - worms. Well-known for self-experimentation, the science journalist infected himself with tapeworms - one of the most unpleasant parasites known to man. Scroll down for video . Parasite: Dr Michael Mosley holds up a tapeworm during his new programme. He infected himself with the tapeworm to see if he lost weight but he actually gained 2lbs after his appetite for carbohydrates increased . The results of his experiment will be broadcast during a new programme called Infested! Living With Parasites which will air on BBC4 next month as part of the corporation's Natural History month. The documentary follows Dr Mosley as he lives with the parasites in his guts for six weeks. Historically tapeworms were thought to be a weight-loss aid, with Victorian women swallowing the parasites' eggs in their quest to lose weight. But Dr Mosley found he actually gained weight, adding 2lbs, during his stint as a human guinea pig. He has also revealed that health and safety regulations meant the BBC cleared him to consume the tapeworms - which can grow up to 100ft in length in the intestines - but drew the line at him deliberately getting head lice, even though it affects millions of schoolchildren each year. Intestine: Dr Mosely realised there was a tapeworm (pictured) inside him when he swallowed a camera to allow him to see whether the cysts had transformed into tapeworms. He had three parasites in his gut . Dr Mosley said his weight gain could have been caused by the need to increase his food intake as a result of the parasites living in his guts. 'I was keeping a food diary to see if my food preferences changed,' he said. A tapeworm is a parasite that can live in a person's intestines. They tend to be flat, segmented and ribbon-like. Humans can catch them by touching contaminated faeces and then putting their hands near their mouth, swallowing contaminated food or water or by eating raw contaminated pork, beef or fish. Many patients do not know they have a tapeworm infection until they see segments of the worm in their stools. Symptoms include stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, weight loss, malnutrition and changes in appetite. A beef tapeworm, as swallowed by Dr Mosley, remains in the intestines and is easily treated with tablets. Other tapeworms can cause serious problems as they can settle in other parts of the body. Tapeworm infections are most common in developing countries - they are rare in the UK. Source: NHS Choices . 'I think I probably ate a bit more chocolate. Tapeworms like beer and chocolate - they like carbohydrates. 'My weight if anything went up a bit. One of the theories is that the tapeworm probably encourages you to eat more. You feed it.' In order to infect himself with the tapeworm, Dr Mosley travelled to Kenya where his team tracked down the parasite, harvesting cysts from the tongue of an infected cow in an abattoir in Nairobi. The cysts form in infected cattle and contain baby beef tapeworm, which can live for up to 20 years. Dr Mosley swallowed three cysts. 'It's not something you can easily lay your hands on,' he said. 'My wife's a GP and she was not very keen but she said it was OK because beef tapeworm is relatively innocuous. And also it is not infectious.' Six weeks later, Dr Mosley swallowed a . camera, to allow him to see whether the cysts had transformed into . tapeworms. Linked to his iPad, the camera revealed that Dr Mosley had . three parasites growing in his gut. The . beef tapeworm makes its home in the intestine and is safer than other . forms of the parasite. The pork tapeworm, in contrast, is far more . dangerous, moving around the body. They can cause brain cysts in humans. Scientists . have been increasingly fascinated by the effects of parasites on the . human body. It has become widely accepted that their eradication in most . parts of the world has led to a rise in allergies and many other . conditions. Historically tapeworms were thought to help people lose weight. But Dr Mosley's experiment revealed he gained 2lbs, the result, he suspects, of his increased appetite . 'I like finding out stuff through my personal experience of it,' Dr Mosley said. 'They get very few people who are . prepared to be infected by tapeworms. Hopefully my faeces will . contribute at some time in the future to a better test. 'There . was a time when Victorian ladies would swallow tapeworm eggs in the . hope that it would help them lose weight, but this was actually a . fallacy because the eggs are not infectious to human beings - they are . only really infectious to cattle. 'It is part of the peculiar life-cycle . of the beef tapeworm that when you pass segments and eggs, they have to . be eaten by a cow before they become infectious.' Producer Nathan Williams said that BBC policies allowed Mosley to consume the tapeworm because it could not be passed from human to human, but parasites such as pinworm and head lice fell foul of guidelines. However, he was allowed to experiment with the lice as long as they were placed on his arm. 'It's fine to eat a tapeworm but they wouldn't let us have a pinworm even though 40 per cent of the children in the UK have it,' Mr Williams said. 'Similarly they wouldn't let us give head lice in the hair because you might give it to other people and it wouldn't be fair to infect Michael's family and his friends.' The tapeworms were killed off using pills, although the team had not been able to trace the bodies being expelled from Dr Mosley's body. He said: 'Nothing came out. There are two possibilities: the most likely possibility is that the pills killed the worms and my body digested the tapeworms which is an ironic end - parasite gets eaten by its host, which is most likely. 'The second possibility is they are still there, but since it is about 13 weeks since I swallowed the cysts, I think I would have noticed by now.'","Dr Michael Mosley infected himself with tapeworm cysts taken from cows .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . She discarded her manager and her boyfriend in the same year. And Kylie Minogue has finally revealed what prompted her to make the decision to spring clean her life last year: A mid-life crisis. The star alludes to feeling despondent by how her life appeared on the ‘horizon’ and was asked if she made the changes in her life in order to give herself a fresh start. Kylie Minogue has finally revealed what prompted her to make the decision to spring clean her life last year: A mid-life crisis . She replied: ‘Yeah I did. I had a true epiphany. I have only had this one and I remember it as if it were slow motion. 'I guess there were thoughts and moments building up to this but I had a vision and the vision was a horizon with nothing on it. 'Our lives never have nothing on the horizon, there is always something you are looking forward to or dreading but there was nothing there. I felt very calm and I knew in that moment that I need a new landscape.’ The 45-year-old split from 35-year-old Spanish model Andrés Velencoso last October after five years, changed her management team and also signed up to be a judge on The Voice, her first foray into the world of live TV talent shows. Miss Minogue has helped boost ratings and turned the show into must-see BBC viewing on a Saturday night. But New Year’s Eve gave Miss Minogue nothing to celebrate. Split: The 45-year-old split from 35-year-old Spanish model Andrés Velencoso last October after five years . Speaking on the Norway chat show Skavlan she said: ‘I spent New Year’s Eve alone, it was one of my best New Year’s actually. No it’s not normal. I have never done it before. If it is the right time for you then I highly recommend it. It was very quiet. I did not do anything special, I did not even have a drink actually. 'Am I sounding very sad right now. I stayed up until midnight and I was happy to be quiet. I actually don’t like too much silence as I think too much but it was meant to be for me. I really enjoyed it. I really reflected on the year as i had known how difficult it had been for many reasons. 'So I wanted to reflect upon that and let those thoughts settle and put some out for the next year. This makes me sound very sensible. I am not normally like this. It was kind of amazing for me to be this organised in my mind.’ Miss Minogue, a child actress, rose to fame in the Australian soap Neighbours. She used her role in the show to launch her career as a singer. Speaking on a Norwegian chat show she said: 'I spent New Year's Eve alone, it was one of my best New Year's actually' Reflecting on her early days in the world of Showbusiness, Miss Minogue told Skavlan: ‘I wished I had said “No” more. It took me a long time to learn to say no. I started as a child actor and as a teenager I never wanted to let anyone down and I think it takes some time to find yourself and the ability to say no.’ And although she is known for her easy charm and mega-watt smile, Miss Minogue revealed she is not immune to being angry – but she simply goes quiet: ‘I don’t have an intimidating voice. I might have a look. I know I have the look. No-one wants the look. When I need to be mad it is silence.

Now his teenage daughter Jimena Vargas wants to follow in her father's footsteps  - even though the job nearly cost him his life when one of the reptiles bit his arm and dragged him into the river. Daredevil: Tour guide Jason Vargas Aguero, 36, hand-feeds giant crocodiles to impress visitors to the Tarcoles River in Costa Rica . Feeding time: Mr Aguero has run the Crocodile Man Tour for the past 15 years, wowing tourists by dropping food into the predator's gaping jaws . Like father like daughter: Mr Aguero's daughter Jimena Vargas shares her father's passion for crocodiles . 'I am only giving her some advice so that if one day she wants to do it, she will know how,' he said. 'I've explained a lot to her and told her she has to know their behaviour, to respect them and to be very, very careful. 'But I hope she doesn't follow in my footsteps. I don't want her to risk her life like her dad has for many years.' Mr Aguero and his family run trips along a 4km stretch of river in Costa Rica where thousands of American crocodiles live and breed. Dangerous: The job nearly cost Mr Aguero his life when one of the more aggressive male reptiles bit his arm and dragged him into the river . Huge: The creatures are among the biggest reptiles in the world, reaching lengths of 17ft long and weighing just under 2000lb . The creatures are among the biggest reptiles in the world, reaching lengths of 17ft long and weighing just under 2000lb. But Mr Aguero - who says the job requires 'bravery, help from God and a little craziness' - said he never wanted to do anything else. 'I do it because it gives me a thrill, lots of adrenaline,' he said. Following in his footsteps: Despite the dangers of her father's job, Jimena shares his interest in the reptiles . Future plans: Schoolgirl Jinema is adamant she will work on the river with her father . Brave: Jimena says she is scared of the crocodiles, but finds her father's job 'nice and interesting' 'I grew up in Tarcoles, close to the river, and so all my life I've seen them and shared with them.' He added: 'The first time feeding them was terrifying, I'm not going to lie. 'The adrenaline rush was massive and it took me a year to get used to them and to trust them a little bit more.' Over the years, Mr Aguero has come to know the crocodiles very well and has given them names based on their characteristics. Family bond: Mr Aguero and Jimena take to the river together . Pride: Mr Aguero says Jimena is proud to tell her friends that he is the Crocodile Man . One female with a larger rear has been named Jennifer Lopez while some of the more aggressive males are named after American presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. 'Believe it or not, every crocodile has its own personality,' he added. 'Some are more aggressive then others. 'But to me the more aggressive they are the better, as it makes a better show.' However, it was one of these larger, more aggressive males that almost killed him in an accident five years ago. Friendly: Over the years, Mr Aguero has come to know the crocodiles very well and has given them names based on their characteristics . Instead of taking the raw chicken he was dangling above its mouth the crocodile leapt forward and clamped its jaws onto his arm. 'He dragged me into the water and I had to fight him,' said Mr Aguero, who spent months in hospital recovering. 'After five minutes I found a branch on which I could sit. I put my finger in his eye and he let go. 'That time it worked but let's hope I won't have to do it again.

"By . Ruth Styles . When Leominster Parish Councillor Peter Ellis unveiled his debut novel, his decision to make a pre-op transsexual woman his main character surprised voters and neighbours alike. Now Ellis, 60, has bravely revealed that not only is his character Jasmine Frame based on real world experiences, he has been secretly dressing as a woman himself for more than 30 years. Ellis, who is not a transsexual but a transvestite, had previously kept his female alter-ego, Penny, a closely guarded secret - known only to his wife, Lou, 66, and close friends. Double life: Peter (pictured left as alter-ego Penny) was tired of keeping Penny a secret from friends and voters . Tired of living a double life, Ellis, . who is a Green party councillor in Leominster, Herefordshire, bravely . revealed Penny's existence to friends and voters after the release of . his debut novel, which he said, convinced him the time was right to come . out. He told them: 'I'm actually [a transvestite] myself although I prefer the term dual role. I spend some of my time in my feminine mode as Penny Ellis although not generally in Leominster. 'I suppose I have been conscious of it for quite a long time but it's 13 years since my wife has known. 'She has been very supportive and helped me come to terms with it.' Brave: Councillor Peter Ellis revealed he had been dressing as a woman in secret for more than 30 years . Understanding: The mayor of Leominster has been supportive after being told of Penny's (right) existence . Peter spent 35 years as a science teacher in Norwich, the Isle of Wight and Newbury before retiring to Herefordshire to write fiction. He was elected to Leominster Parish Council where 'one or two' of his fellow councillors were aware of his dual life. Peter, who has two step children, said: 'With the publication of [debut novel] Painted Ladies it was time I came out and told the world about Penny. 'I thought it might be useful to make the central character in the book someone who is transsexual and use the novel to present the transition to a place where she wants to be.' Debut novel: Peter's first work of fiction, Painted Ladies, was based on his own experience . Cardiff-born Peter has written a number of educational books and short stories but Painted Ladies is his first attempt at crime fiction. The 290-page thriller, which took Peter 10 years to write, follows pre-op transsexual Jasmine on the trail for a knife-killer. The book was rejected by publishers so Peter published it himself, using his savings to finance an initial print run of 500 copies. He is already halfway through the second Jasmine Frame book and says he has enough material to write three or more. He said: 'As I was planning it I thought, actually this is a series. Painted Ladies is the first one, introducing the character of Jasmine Frame and looking at her point of view. 'I hope it's a fun book to read and reports so far have suggested it does do that. It's an exciting story and I hope that in the process it explains a bit about what transgenderism means and the difficulties we face.' The councillor's revelation has caused a stir among Peter's colleagues on Leominster town council, but Mayor Molly Cooke, 80, said it was a private matter for Mr Ellis. She said yesterday: 'I heard we have a trans-something-or-other councillor but only through people talking. 'I don't have the internet to look up these things but there's no big scandal. It's nothing to do with the town council what he does in his private life. 'I think you are what you are - no one gets a choice. We all play the hand we're dealt. I think we've gone past the days where these things can be frowned at. I believe in live and let live.'Painted Ladies is available for £8.99 from Amazon and is also on sale at the Leominster Tourist Information Centre.","Councillor Peter Ellis, 60, has secretly dressed as a woman for 30 years .

"By . Anna Edwards . Police are making fresh investigations into whether dead paedophile Raymond Hewlett had anything to with the disappearance of missing Madeleine McCann. The 64-year-old pervert was living just an hour's drive from where the youngster disappeared in the Algarve in May 2007 while she was on holiday with her parents. Scotland Yard detectives now allegedly want to speak to a couple who the child molester befriended while they were on holiday and who allegedly told them gypsies had approached him asking to buy his children. Raymond Hewlett says he spoke to gypsies who were interested in buying children . Alan and Cindy Thompson, from Nottingham, only discovered after their Portugal holiday the history of the former soldier when they returned home, and raised the alarm when they realised he had been living in a caravan close to where the three-year-old vanished, the Daily Mirror reported. The pervert, who died of throat cancer in 2010, told the couple that he refused to sell one of his six children to 'gypsy tourists'. He also boasted to them of making a 'good business trip' with his family to Morocco to make a sale, but would not elaborate on the nature of his trip. Numerous people contacted authorities to say they had spotted a girl matching Maddie's description in North Africa after she disappeared. Madeleine McCann vanished in the Algarve days before her fourth birthday . But Hewlett, who was living with his wife and six children on a campsite when Madeleine disappeared, refused to answer the Thompson's questions when they contacted him in 2009. When he was confronted by private detectives Dave Edgar and Arthur Cowley, working on behalf of Maddie's devastated parents Kate and Gerry McCann, he refused to answer their questions on provide an alibi, it was reported. Madeleine vanished days before her fourth birthday from an apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz while her parents, Kate and Gerry, had dinner with friends in a nearby tapas restaurant. Raymond Hewlett denied knowing about the youngster's disappearance . Hewlett's worrying revelation came after another person said that he had spoken to them about the pervert's claims that gypsies had approached him about buying children. Former Scots Guard Peter Verran, 46, who met Hewlett on a Morrocan campsite between June and November 2007, said the criminal had told him that gypsies had paid for children and sold them on to paedophiles. In 2012 Hewlett 'confessed' to knowing what happened to the little girl on his deathbed, it was claimed. Raymond Hewlett  wrote to his estranged son denying he played a part in the three-year-old’s abduction, but claimed he knew she had been ‘stolen to order’ by a gypsy gang. Hewlett had previously claimed to have seen the missing toddler twice before she vanished in 2007. But he vowed only to reveal where he was the night she went missing if he was paid thousands of pounds. Kate and Gerry McCann’s private detectives refused the request. In May the £2million police review of the Madeleine McCann case said it would examine calls from psychics which were previously ignored. Detectives said they would study around 100 logs of calls that were discounted because the callers said they were psychics or had dreamt about the high-profile investigation. Policia Judiciaria refused to confirm whether they had ever questioned the paedophile, the newspaper reported. Kate and Gerry McCann have tirelessly looked for their missing daughter, who was taken as they had dinner . A spokesman for Scotland Yard told the Daily Mirror: 'We are not prepared to discuss any particular lines of enquiry.'. Hewlett was jailed several times in the UK for sexually assaulting young girls, including an attack in 1978 where he put a gun to his victim's back. In June 2009, before his death, West Yorkshire Police confirmed its officers were investigating Hewlett in connection with an indecent assault in 1975.","Raymond Hewlett boasted of knowing gypsy families who 'wanted to buy children'

"By . Louise Boyle . The husband of the housekeeper who worked for Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade filed a court complaint that his wife was being kept in 'slavery-like conditions' and his family was threatened with being kidnapped, it has been revealed. Philip Richard, husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. The release of the new document this week reveals that a legal complaint was lodged against Devyani Khobragade in her home country prior to charges of visa fraud being filed against her in the U.S. this month. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed later in July because the Indian court had 'no jurisdiction... on foreign soil'. Consular official Dr Khobragade was arrested this month as she dropped her children off at their Manhattan school. She is accused of lying on a visa application for Mrs Richard with prosecutors claiming she only paid the servant $3 per hour. Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York . In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions or keeping a person in bondage.' The petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of what the woman took. Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil'. The case has escalated into an international incident with Indians reacting with fury over the treatment of Khobragade who claims she was strip searched at a New York jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers. Prosecutors allege that Khobragade falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $4,500 a month. Then, when the housekeeper came to the U.S., Khobragade told her that she would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $600, according to prosecutors. India's foreign minister has demanded the U.S. drop charges against Khobragade. Although Secretary of State John Kerry made a phone call to Indian officials last week to placate the situation, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara released a . statement saying that . the charges would not be dropped. Devyani Khobragade was arrested earlier this month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour . Uttam Khobragade, father of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment . The statement read: 'One wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the Indian victim and her spouse?' Attorney Dana Sussman, who is . representing Mrs Richard though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe . Horizon, spoke on Sunday of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that . focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal . defendant. She pointed out that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard. Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage. In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court in December . Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama during the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute . Ms Sussman refused to comment on her client and her family’s whereabouts since Mrs Richard walked out of her job in June. Dana Sussman, who is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row . Mrs . Richard’s husband Philip and parents flew to the U.S. two days before . police swooped on Khobragade and arresting her at the gates of her . daughter’s Upper East Side school. U.S. diplomats in India swiftly found . many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from . their embassy in New Delhi. Secretary . of State John Kerry expressed his ‘regret as well as his concern’ over . the incident in a telephone call to Indian National Security Advisor . Shivshanker Menon. He spoke of his hope that the ‘close and vital . relationship with India’ remain unharmed. But . nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of Visa Fraud one of . False Statement – against Dr Khobragade seems likely to satisfy Indian . authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation’s . parliament. Against this . backdrop Mrs Sussman’s statement continued: ‘Mrs Richard is not on trial . here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that . there are charges against Khobragade for violating US law and those . charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker. ‘That is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between US and India.’ A group supporting domestic workers' rights demonstrate across the street from the Indian Consulate General on December 20 in New York .","Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard, said that his wife was forced to work 17 hours a day .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Scarlett Johansson's distinctive rising sun tattoo was conspicuously missing when her controversial Soda Stream ad aired during the Super Bowl. The actress has a multi-colored rising sun tattoo on her inside left forearm, and though it would have only been visible for a quick second of the ad, it was very clearly missing. It is unknown whether the tattoo was covered up with makeup or airbrushed out after the fact, but there is speculation that the meaning behind that tattoo could have caused problems with Soda Stream executives. Missing: Scarlett Johansson's inner left forearm is shown during a brief moment of the 30-second Soda Stream ad, but her tattoo is conspicuously missing . Normal: She regularly displays her brightly colored rising sun tattoo on her inner left forearm at events . Though the 28-year-old identifies as Jewish, but goes against the religion's mandate that forbids followers from having tattoos. Though she turned into somewhat of a lightning rod for controversy with the spot, many praised the selection of Johansson as the Israeli company's first global spokesperson. It is unclear who mandated that her tattoos were 'erased' from the ad- whether it was Johansson or the company executives- and MailOnline's calls were not immediately returned. Not only is her colorful rising sun tattoo from her inner left forearm mysteriously missing, but so is the rosary bead bracelet she has on one wrist and the small interlacing circles on her inner ankle. For much of the 30-second spot, she . was covered in a bathrobe, in the final moments, she takes off the robe . to show that she is wearing a form-fitting black dress. During that reveal, her left arm is is shown and there is no visible tattoo. Part of her off-screen persona: Scarlett rarely covers up the tattoos when she is not working . Both sides: The rosary tattoo that she has on her right wrist was also gone from the ad . Causing pause: Soda Stream, an Israeli company, was praised for picking a Jewish global ambassador but the faith also prohibits followers from getting tattoos . The same is true of her right wrist, as it is visible when she demonstrates how to use Soda Stream but there is no rosary bracelet visible at the time. This is not the first time that her tattoos have been removed during an ad campaign, as her tattoos are also conspicuously missing when she posed as a pin-up for a Dolce and Gabbana make up ad. The motivation behind removing her tattoo is just the latest controversy relating to the multi-million dollar ad, since the company's use of Palestinian factories led to her decision to drop her ambassadorship with Oxfam since the children's charity opposes work in the occupied territory. Not the first time: Johansson's tattoos have been removed in other ad campaigns as well .","Actress has multiple tattoos that were not shown in the Super Bowl spot .

The verdict could have serious repercussions for all Twitter users if Love is found guilty of defaming her former attorney in less than 140 characters. The case dates back to a tweet sent by Love in 2010 in which she suggested Rhonda Holmes had been ‘bought off’. Courtney Love has been taken to court by her former lawyer in the first ever case of an alleged libel on Twitter going to trial . At the time, Love had retained Holmes and her San Diego firm, Gordon & Holmes, to pursue a fraud case against the executors of her late husband Kurt Cobain’s estate. Holmes sued Love in May 2011 over the tweet sent from the now suspended @CourtneyLoveUK account. ‘@noozjunkie I was f***ing devastated when Rhonda J Holmes Esq of san diego was bought off @fairnewsspears perhaps you can get a quote,’ she tweeted. Gordon & Holmes claim Love defamed it online after it stipulated that the singer ‘remain clean and sober’ while it represented her case, reports Spin. The case dates back to a tweet sent by Love in 2010 in which she suggested Rhonda Holmes, left, had been 'bought off' Yet according to the complaint, ‘There was never any indication Love honored this condition,’ which allegedly ‘caused Love to become angry with plaintiffs.’ While a number of Twitter-related libel cases have been filed in the past few years - including one in 2009 involving Love that was settled out of court - none before have gone to trial. When she took the witness stand on Wednesday, Love, 49, said the tweet was merely an opinion and that the internet is full of hyperbole and exaggeration. Love said she thought she was only tweeting it to two people. Last month, Love claimed that her tweet was not defamatory because, in the context of the internet, it represents an opinion. However, Judge Michael Johnson did not agree and sent the case to trial. The . trial, originally scheduled to finish up by the end of next week, is . expected to continue for at least a few days beyond that. The offending tweet was send from the now defunct @CourtneyLoveUK account and the singer now tweets as @Courtney . The verdict in this case could have serious . repercussions for all Twitter users if Courtney Love is found guilty of defaming . her former attorney. ‘The Courtney Love Twitter lawsuit is . monumental because the judge has now determined that tweeting in . California can potentially give rise to liability under the theory of . defamation,’ attorney Brian Claypool told ABC. ‘The . Courtney Love case will set a precedent that will result in, . potentially, the average person being liable as well,’ he added. The . case could also re-write the rules for much-loved celebrity Twitter . wars that have made headlines over the years such as Miley Cyrus vs. Sinead .

"By . Nina Golgowski . Hero: Jon Candelaria, right, pulled a trapped taxi driver from his vehicle. The taxi driver left before Candelaria could get his name . As Hurricane Sandy's flood waters rose higher and higher around a stranded New York taxi cab on Monday night its, driver appeared helpless against the 14-foot storm surge that grew to his chin. But offering a final moment of mercy, witnesses watched as 25-year-old Jon Candelaria selflessly left his Upper East Side apartment to reach the man trapped in the churning water and wind. 'He looked like he was praying, preparing to die. He looked like he knew it was his time to go,' Mr Candelaria told DNA Info of the moment he reached the yellow SUV’s window. Standing at 6-feet-5, the East River’s water had swept up to Mr Candelaria's chest as he waded out to the vehicle he had spotted from his seventh floor apartment - a public housing complex on East 93rd street and First Avenue. From that window, at the peak of the storm, Mr Candelaria’s mother had let out a scream when catching sight of the cab as it abruptly lifted and spun 180-degrees around in the tide. 'That's when my mom flipped out,' Mr Candelaria recalled. Slipping on a jacket over a pair of shorts, Mr Candelaria began his dash outside and into the water while his mother dialed 911. '911 was overloaded. If we had waited for help, he would have died,' he said. Dipping into the water he estimated feeling like 40-degrees, Mr Candelaria said it didn't take long for the water to rise from his ankles to his chest. Wading one step at a time it was then a flash of his two-year-old daughter entered his head - his greatest risk of leaving behind. 'I would do it for anybody,' he later said of his decision. 'It doesn't matter who you are; you're a human being.' Dangerous: Standing at 6-feet-5, the East River's water had swept up to Mr Candelaria's chest as he waded out to the vehicle, pictured . Reaching the door he pulled at its handle but found it stuck, unable to budge against the water. Enlisting the driver's help, whom he said showed only brief panic, he signaled for them to both try on the count of three. Counting off, he said something unusual happened. 'As soon as I hit three, it seemed like everything became calm,' Mr Candelaria said, describing the wind briefly pausing for the first time. Pealing it open, Mr Candeleria was seen by other residents grabbing the driver from his vehicle and tossing him over his shoulder to begin their trek back. ‘Even if he had managed to get out of the car, I don't think he would have made it because he was so short,’ Mr Candeleria said of the man found to be 5-foot-1 in height. Floating: Mr Candelaria's mother had let out a scream when catching sight of the cab as it abruptly lifted and spun 180-degrees around in the tide . Inside his building, witnesses to the scene poured out to help and catch sight of the hero. 'I said ""Oh my God, you are a hero,' Rita Callahan, a resident in the building recalled to DNA Info. '""That waster was churning. It could have swept you away.'"" ‘I'm not a hero,’ Mr Candelaria said. ‘What was I supposed to do?

"By . Meghan Keneally . UPDATED: . 04:41 EST, 10 February 2012 . A veteran news anchor who was rushed to the hospital after a dog that appeared on her morning show bit her in the face on live TV was released this afternoon. Though Kyle Dyer still cannot talk, she has told friends and colleagues that she is concerned about the viewers who saw her get savagely bitten by the 85-pound Argentine Mastiff who was being highlighted in a morning news segment. Footage has now emerged which shows the dog desperately splashing around in an icy lake the day before - an ordeal which may partly explain his vicious behaviour in the studio. Scroll down for video (Warning: Graphic content) On TV: Kyle Dyer, right, had knelt down to pet Max when he attacked. He is seen here with his owner, Michael Robinson, and the firefighter that rescued him . Attack: In a flash, Max bares his teeth and lashes out at Ms Dyers face. Animal control officers called it a 'pretty major bite.' Ms Dyer, who had been working at the . Denver, Colorado station for over 15 years, had reconstructive surgery . Wednesday afternoon following the attack, and was released from the hospital Thursday afternoon. In order to communicate, she is using tools on her iPad to type out messages to loved ones. The dog, whose full name is Warrior Maximus, . recently survived a harrowing rescue from a freezing pond and was on . the show as part of a mini-reunion between him and his rescuers. A video of Max trying unsuccessfully to find a way out of the pond was released today, and provides some context for the background which led him to lash out the next day. Struggle: Max the dog was filmed swimming around in an icy pool, unable to escape . Rescue: The dog was recovered thanks to a fireman, leading to his ill-fated appearance on the news . Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots. 'Max is current in his vaccinations. Max has no history of aggression. Max is a gentle, loving, family dog. Max is well mannered and obedient and he hardly barks,' said the dog's owners The Robinsons in a statement. 'This incident truly is unfortunate and does not reflect Maxâ€™s disposition towards people.' Now, Max has been caged by animal control officers and his owner, Michael Robinson has been fined. In addition to comments wishing Ms Dyer well, most Facebook respondents left angry messages blaming her for getting too close to the dog. Bitten: Ms Dyer was rushed to the local hospital in Denver and has been examined by a trauma team to determine how to repair the damage to her face . Ferocious: Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots . 'I totally agree with all those saying it was her own fault and she should have known better,' wrote Cassandra Hughes Kramer. 'The dog was being a dog, defending . itself in a stressful situation. He didn't jump on her and maul her, he . nipped her lip....and she shouldn't have been trying to kiss him. Maybe . it's a hard lesson to learn, but hopefully she learned it.' A number of viewers also expressed . concern that the dog would be euthanized as a result of the incident, . which was something they appeared angry about. 'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake?Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto. Treatment: Ms Dyer is now recovering after surgery Wednesday afternoon at Denver Health Medical Center . Part of the team: Ms Dyer (left) has been . working for the station for over 15 years, many of which she has . co-anchored with Gary Shapiro (right) 'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said . Argentine mastiffs, also known as the . Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have . gone after wild boars and pumas. While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs. Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado. Aurora is the neighbouring city to Denver, where the broadcast took place. The . animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the . UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute . them. Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.' Unless the dog has rabies - which it is not showing signs of - it will not be put down. Even if the vaccinations are current, the owners will definitely face two charges from Denver Animal Care and Control: a penalty for having the dog bite someone and a second penalty for having the dog off its leash at the time. 'While we normally walk Max on-leash, we understand that by letting him off-leash in an open area away from anyone was still a mistake. We will never walk him off-leash in public areas after this,' the Robinsons said in their statement. Max was brought into the studio after the station's news chopper captured . video footage of a firefighter rescuing Max from a freezing pond Monday . after he fell through the ice and couldn't make it out. 'I know that she is a great journalist . who loves happy stories - this was a happy story,' her co-anchor Gary . Shapiro said in a note to fans. 'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said. Though she is out of the hospital, her recovery is just beginning. Ms Dyer, who is married and has children, is expected to take several weeks to return to work. 'She's . doing well, and will make a recovery, and we're all thinking about her . and her family,' said 9News vice president Patti Dennis. 'Kyle- . of all people!- is the biggest dog lover and even yesterday we were . talking about how, as dog lovers, we think every dog belongs to us.

"By . Helen Lawson . Pope Francis and his predecessor Benedict embraced today in a historic meeting of two popes at Castel Gandolfo. The men met on the helipad at the papal summer retreat, before praying together in the chapel. Benedict offered Francis the kneeler traditionally used by the pope when he prays. But Francis refused to take it alone, saying 'We're brothers', and the two used a different kneeler in the pews and prayed together, side-by-side. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis met Benedict, pope emeritus, today at the papal retreat where the retired pontiff is staying . Francis presented Benedict with an icon of the Virgin Mary during their meeting . The two shared a kneeler as they prayed together in the villa's chapel, with Francis rejecting the use of the papal kneeler to share with his 'brother' Benedict made clear that he deferred to Francis as pope while Francis made clear he considered his predecessor to be a revered brother and equal. Today's meeting is the first between two popes in more than 600 years as the Catholic Church finds itself in the unusual position of having two alive at the same time. Traveling from the helipad to the palazzo, Francis sat on the right-hand side of the car, the traditional place of the pope, while Benedict sat on the left. Francis brought a gift to Benedict, an icon of the Madonna, and told him that it is known as the 'Madonna of Humility.' 'I thought of you,' Francis told him as he presented the gift. 'You gave us so many signs of humility and gentleness in your pontificate.' Benedict replied: 'Grazie, grazie.' Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi said he understands Benedict reiterated his pledge of obedience to the new pope, while Francis thanked Benedict for his ministry. He said they both wore white, though Benedict was in a simple cassock and a quilted white jacket without the traditional sash and cape worn by Francis. Walking with a cane, he looked frail compared to the robust 76-year-old Argentine. Outside the villa, the main piazza of . Castel Gandolfo was packed with well-wishers hoping to catch a . glimpse of history as the two popes broke bread together and presumably . discussed the future of the Catholic Church. They chanted 'Francesco! Francesco.' Benedict has been living at the papal summer villa since he officially retired on February 28, the first pope to step down in 600 years. He has said he plans to live out his final years in prayer and remain 'hidden from the world.' The Vatican is downplaying the lunch in keeping with Benedict's desire to remain in private and not interfere with his successor's papacy. The men spoke privately for 45 minutes before sharing a meal with the two papal secretaries. The two men both wore the white robes of the papacy, but Benedict chose a cassock and quilted jacket, leaving the cape and sash to Francis . The Vatican press office issued photographs of the pair praying together and exchanging gifts before they were left to speak privately . There was to be no live coverage of the private meeting, only a few still photos from the official Vatican photographer. The . Vatican said Benedict was at the helipad in the villa gardens to . welcome Francis, and that the two were meeting in Benedict's library and . having lunch together. Francis will then return to the Vatican later today, where crowds were gathering in St Peter's Square ahead of the Palm Sunday mass tomorrow and Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday. Earlier, . he flew to the town on an Italian Air Force helicopter in scenes . reminiscent of the night Benedict officially retired from the Church. The Vatican spokesman said they would issue a general comment about the meeting but will not be giving a detailed account. Benedict's resignation paved the way for the first pope from Latin America, the first Jesuit, and the first to call himself Francis after the 13th century friar who devoted himself to the poor, nature and working for peace. There was speculation that the two popes may discuss the big issues facing the church: the rise of secularism in the world, the drop in priestly vocations in Europe, the competition that the Catholic Church faces in Latin America and Africa from evangelical Pentecostal movements. Benedict left a host of unfinished business on Francis' plate, including the outcome of a top-secret investigation into the leaks of papal documents last year. Francis may want to sound Benedict out on his ideas for management changes in the Holy See administration, a priority given the dysfunctional government he has inherited. After their private chat, Francis and Benedict were joined for lunch by the two papal secretaries . After their private chat, Francis and Benedict were joined for lunch by the two papal secretaries .

Pope Francis was inaugurated on Tuesday and led his first mass as pontiff in St Peter's Square in the Vatican . A week before the inauguration, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio appeared on the balcony of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace after his election was announced . Benedict's resignation and the emeritus pope's personal choices about his future have raised the question of how the Catholic Church will deal with the unusual situation of having one reigning and one retired pope living side-by-side, each of them called 'pope', each of them wearing papal white and even sharing the same aide in Gaenswein. After a few months in Castel Gandolfo, Benedict is to return to the Vatican to live in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens, just a short walk from St. Peter's Basilica and the shrine devoted to the Madonna where Francis went to pray on one of his first walks as pope.","Francis flew to Castel Gandolfo where the retired pope is staying .

The Syrian Electronic Army has claimed responsibility for a cyber attack after the pro-Assad group hacked into the U.S. Marines website on Monday and posted seemingly staged pictures of 'servicemen' holding up signs condemning American military strikes. The picture of an unidentified man, dressed like a Navy officer, swept the web after he appeared in full regalia while covering his face with a sign which read: 'I didn't join the Navy to fight for al Qaeda in a Syrian civil war!' It has now been revealed that marines.com was infiltrated by the SEA but quickly returned to normal. It follows the hacking of the New York Times website last week where nothing but error messages appeared for seven hours. Hacked: The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) posted this message on the U.S Marines website with pictures of 'servicemen' holding up signs condemning attacks . Faked: An unidentified man, dressed in Navy regalia and believed to have been staged by pro-Assad hackers, offered this message on the deepening crisis in Syria as the U.S. comes closer to military intervention . The SEA wrote a long message to its . 'brothers' in the Marines, according to the International Business . Times. The hack included pictures of men dressed in U.S. military uniforms . holding up signs condemning attacks on Syria. Since the image appeared online, it has been re-tweeted hundreds of times and shared thousands of times on Facebook. The SEA's latest hack comes as President Obama and his top aides launch a . full-scale political offensive to persuade a skeptical . Congress to approve a military strike against Syria. The administration faces an uphill . struggle to win over lawmakers from both parties and a war-weary . American public.

Call for action: Protesters demanding military action shout over those opposing it at joint rallies in Washington DC on Sunday . Split: Protesters for and against military action confront each other outside the White House . Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President Biden meet with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to discuss Syria on Sunday . The President made calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for today, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government. Protesters across the country took to the streets this weekend for and against a possible U.S.-led attack on Syria. In Houston, Texas, which has a large Syrian-American population, about 100 people lined up on opposite sides of a street in an upscale neighborhood to express opposing views on a possible U.S. attack. 'We want any kind of action. The world has stood silently and it's been too long. Something needs to be done,' said Tamer Barazi, a 23-year-old civil engineer who carried a Syrian flag and a sign - 'Syrian Americans for peace, democracy and freedom in Syria.' Demonstrations erupted on both East and West coasts of the United States, and cities in between. In DC, . anti-war demonstrators chanted and waved placards outside the White . House. Across the street, Syrians and Syrian Americans who support U.S. action waved flags from their country and shouted for Assad's ouster. Later, . in Los Angeles, about 200 people shouting 'Hands off Syria' protested . against a possible American strike. They waved signs reading 'No More . War' and police said they wrote up more than 40 citations after . demonstrators sat in street intersections and blocked traffic. Police . reported two arrests. Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Obama's national security team. But the credibility of the . administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important . issue than the nature and usefulness of the response. U.S. military officials are using the . delay to reassess which ships will be used for a strike, and which . sites in Syria to target. One . change was a decision to send the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and its . entire strike group towards the Red Sea to help support the Syria . strike, if needed. Syria's brutal two-and-a-half-year-old conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives, including hundreds who - according to the U.S. - were killed in chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian regime near Damascus on August 21. Syrian President Bashar Assad's . government has denied involvement, instead blaming rebels for the . attacks. Neither the U.S. nor the Assad regime has presented proof in . public to back up the allegations. In . Washington, Obama was lobbying Congress to support a military strike to . punish the Assad regime for its alleged chemical weapons use. Obama . initially seemed poised to launch military action without asking . Congress, but over the weekend changed his mind. A vote is expected . after Congress returns from summer recess on September 7. Obama was to meet with former . political rival Senator John McCain at the White House on Monday, hoping . the foreign policy hawk will help sell the idea of U.S. military . intervention. On Capitol . Hill, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in private on . Sunday to explain why the U.S. was compelled to act against Assad. Further meetings were planned from Monday to Wednesday. Innocents: According to U.S. estimates, of the 1,429 killed in the attack, 426 were children . Responsibility: French agents say Assad's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus on August 21 . The Arab League, meanwhile, stopped short of endorsing military action. In an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday, it called on the United Nations and the international community to take 'deterrent' measures under international law to stop the Syrian regime's crimes, but could not agree on whether to back U.S. military strikes. Two of Assad's most influential . foreign backers, China and Russia, lined up against Washington's new . attempt to make the case for a military strike. China . is 'highly concerned' about possible unilateral military action against . Syria and believes the international community must 'avoid complicating . the Syrian issue and dragging the Middle East down into further . disaster,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in Beijing on . Monday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey . Lavrov, meanwhile, dismissed U.S. information given to Moscow on the . alleged chemical weapons attack as 'absolutely unconvincing'. There . was 'nothing specific' in the evidence presented by Washington, Lavrov . said. 'No geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were . carried out by the professionals.' He did not say what tests he was referring to. Debate: The President meets national security advisers  to discuss possible military action . Lavrov said U.S. officials told the Russian government they cannot share all the evidence because some of it is classified. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. received new physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that show sarin gas was used in the August 21 attack. Kerry said the U.S. must respond with its credibility on the line. The Syria conflict erupted in March 2011 as an uprising against Assad that quickly transformed into a civil war. The fighting has displaced 5 million inside Syria, according to the UN. In addition, nearly 2 million Syrians have crossed into neighboring countries, previously released UN figures show. Before the outbreak of the conflict, Syria had a population of about 23 million people.","Photo of sailor, who bears the insignia of a Chief Petty Officer, now appears to have been faked by the pro-Assad group .

The 'American Cool' exhibit is currently on show at the National Portrait Gallery, in Washington, D.C. America, until 7 September. Included in the exhibit are the likes of jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and Billie Holiday, actors such as Johnny Depp, and singers such as Elvis Presley and Debbie Harry.

The 'King of Rock and Roll' Elvis Presley sings to his fans - years after his 1977 death he is still regarded as cool . The curators of the exhibition had four defining factors of cool, of which people chosen had to fit at least three categories: . • originality of artistic vision and especially of a signature style . • cultural rebellion, or transgression in a given historical moment . • iconicity, or a certain level of high-profile recognition . • recognised cultural legacy (lasting more than a decade) The term 'cool' originated in the United States in the early 1940s when legendary jazz saxophonist Lester Young brought the central African American concept into the modern vernacular. Given the large number of celebrities that this term has been used to describe, an alternative list was also created for those who did not make the Top 100. This list included the likes of Samuel L Jackson, Gwen Stefani, and Tom Petty. The portraits that feature in the . gallery were contemporary images shot by famous photographers such as .

'What you might find surprising about this show is how far back this idea reaches. 'I especially like this how this exhibition shows photographs of icons by world-renowned photographers.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's official: The Bermuda Triangle is a myth. After decades of speculation that aliens, black-hole vortices and evil Atlantis influences were responsible for the disappearance of dozens of ships and planes in the 'Devil's Triangle', the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has set the record straight. The U.S. government agency claims that foul weather and poor navigation are likely to blame for any mishaps in the area between Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. 'There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,' the agency stated on its website this month. The Bermuda Triangle: Dozens of ships and planes have mysteriously vanished in this area between Miami, Puerto Rico and Bermuda, but authorities blame poor navigation and bad weather . Ben Sherman, spokesman for NOAA's National Ocean Service, told Sun Sentinel the agency wrote the story as part of an educational program where it responds to readers' questions. Their comments are based on 'scientific evidence' from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Guard which don't 'recognize the existence of the so-called Bermuda Triangle as a geographic area of specific hazard to ships or planes. 'In a review of many aircraft and vessel losses in the area over the years, there has been nothing discovered that would indicate that casualties were the result of anything other than physical causes,' the military branch said. The mystery of Flight 19: Five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers carrying 14 men for a training exercise disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle no December 5, 1945. The aviation mystery sparked the 'myth' of the 'Devil's Triangle . 'Missing vessel': This reward sign posted at a Miami, Florida marina on  26 April, 1974, was for the yacht Saba Bank, which vanished in the Bermuda Triangle on March 10, 1974 . According to Gizmodo, The Bermuda Triangle’s bad reputation started with Christopher Columbus's October 8, 1492, log in which he noted weird readings in the area. But it wasn't until the 1950s that some of the more outrageous theories and superstitions emerged. The legend kicked off after an article written by Edward Van Winkle Jones was published by the Associated Press. Jones reported several incidences of disappearing ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle, including five US Navy torpedo bombers that vanished on December 5, 1945, and the commercial airliners 'Star Tiger' and 'Star Ariel' which disappeared on January 30, 1948 and January 17, 1949 respectively. He said about 135 individuals were unaccounted for and they all went missing around the Bermuda Triangle, 'swallowed without a trace.' Tragic: Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and five other passengers vanished without a trace while flying from the islands of Los Roque to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas on January 4 last year. The area has been compared to the Bermuda Triangle . Cursed: Baffled investigators have heard that Missoni has fallen victim to the 'Los Roques Curse', a paranormal phenomenon said to be similar to that of the Bermuda Triangle . In January last year, Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and five other passengers went missing while flying from the islands of Los Roque to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas. It was claimed they were victims of the 'Los Roques Curse', a paranormal phenomenon that has been compared to the notorious Bermuda Triangle. NOAA doesn't believe in such myths. The agency claims there many other reasonable explanations, such as methane gas erupting from ocean sediments and overwhelming vessels. NOAA also contends that hurricanes and tropical storms, which frequently churn through the triangle, are more likely explanations for ships or planes getting into trouble . 'The ocean has always been a mysterious place to humans, and when foul weather or poor navigation is involved, it can be a very deadly place,' NOAA said. 'This is true all over the world.'","Dozens of ships and planes have mysteriously vanished in the area between Miami, Puerto Rico and Bermuda .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Bee species that were teetering on the verge of extinction in the UK have made a remarkable recovery, much to the delight of conservationists. A project that began as an attempt to re-introduce one species of extinct bee to Britain has sparked a comeback by five more varieties whose numbers had dwindled alarmingly in recent decades. Conservationists say the speed of their recovery suggests that the bees can in fact cope with some pesticide use by farmers, if they have wild flowers to feed on and a place to live. Thriving: A project to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee to Britain has sparked a comeback by five more bee varieties . Dr Nikki Gammans, of the Short-Haired Bumblebee Project, said: 'It’s not a doom and gloom scenario. We can actually reverse this trend.' Pesticides have been blamed for killing off many bumblebees, as has the loss of 97per cent of the UK's wild flower meadows since the 1930s due to agricultural intensification and urbanisation. Bees are vital for the environment as they pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth £560m a year to the UK economy. Seven of the country's 25 bumblebee species are now considered threatened enough to be in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. However, five of these, the brown-banded carder, moss carder, red-shanked carder, large garden and shrill carder, have been found in increasing numbers at the project in Kent, which aimed to reintroduce short-haired bumblebee queens to the UK. Revival: Several species of carder bee have been found in increasing numbers at the project base near Dungeness, Kent . A-buzz: Bees are vital for the environment as they pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth £560m a year to the UK economy . As a result of the scheme the endangered queens, which were brought to the UK from Sweden, nested in the country this autumn for the first time in 25 years. Conservationists began the project in 2009 by encouraging wild flowers to grow on a 20-hectare plot near Dungeness in Kent. They have now expanded this prime bee habitat across more than 800 hectares in Kent and Sussex. The programme has attracted attention in France, where officials believe the researchers may have found a way to halt bumblebee decline across Europe. Cédric Vanappelghem, a conservation officer in northern France, said its 'results are good', and added that they were planning to study bumblebees there shortly. Larry Cooke, a Romney Marsh farmer who has been taking part in the project, said: 'If we don’t have bumblebees, we won’t have pollination. 'If we don’t have pollination, you won’t have food for the country.'","Project intended to reintroduce short-haired bumblebees to the UK .

"By . Luke Salkeld . A teacher has been struck off for having sex with a 16-year-old boy after seducing him with photographs of herself in various poses on Facebook. Mother-of-two Clare Horton, 33, posted a series of self-portraits known as ‘selfies’, before her relationship with the pupil became sexual. She showed him pictures of herself in a lacy top and a black dress with a plunging neckline while he was revising for his GCSEs. Selfie: Teacher Clare Horton, who had a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old pupil, according to a disciplinary hearing . It was heard she sent the boy messages on Facebook with pictures of herself posing . The design teacher claimed she had been simply seeking ‘the hand of friendship’ from the teenager as she went through an acrimonious divorce and they did not have sex. But she was found guilty of misconduct and banned from teaching for two years. Mrs Horton, who was head of year 11 at the time, sent the teenager messages on Facebook while he was on study leave for his GCSE exams. A disciplinary hearing was told she met the schoolboy for a revision time ‘rendezvous’ before driving him back to her home in Newport, South Wales. The boy, known as Pupil A, later told police he had sex with the teacher but did not want to press charges because of his ‘strict  religious beliefs’. Mrs Horton worked at Fitzalan High School in Leckwith, Cardiff, for ten years. Trusted: Horton was was head of year 11 at Fitzalan High School in Cardiff . A Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council of Wales heard that ‘a number’ of pupils had messaged her on Facebook. She agreed to meet Pupil A and drove him to her home, where the pair are said to have had an afternoon sex session before she dropped him off at his home and went to pick up her two young children. The teacher, who was going through a bitter divorce at the time, claimed all she took from him was 'the hand of friendship' Rumours quickly spread in the school. After taking two weeks’ sick leave, Mrs Horton told head teacher Catherine Bradshaw that she had ‘slept’ with the boy and handed in her notice. The head referred the matter to social services and the police but the Crown Prosecution Service decided to take no further action. Mrs Bradshaw said Mrs Horton was well respected and  her actions were ‘out of character’. In a statement given to the disciplinary hearing in Cardiff, Mrs Horton said she had committed ‘the ultimate sin’, but denied that sex had taken place. She claimed that she simply chatted to the boy before falling asleep on the sofa for a couple of hours. ‘I was in an incredibly emotional state and sexual intercourse was the last thing on my mind,’ said the teacher. ‘All I took from Pupil A was the hand of friendship. ‘Because of what was going on at home, teaching was my only lifeline. To be told I was anything other than ugly, fat, useless and worthless was a safety blanket that I foolishly used. ‘He was very kind and listened. I was just talking about what was going on with my ex-husband. He made me feel better. ‘He slept at my house and so did I. I slept alongside him. We did not have sexual intercourse.’ The teacher, who broke down in tears while giving evidence, added: ‘Within days of the event, I felt I had committed the ultimate sin. I was in such a bad place mentally. ‘The feeling of shame and regret is something I will never be able to get rid of.’ She added that she ‘deserved to be punished’. Martin Jones, who presented the evidence at the hearing, said Mrs Horton’s behaviour ‘clearly amounted to a significant breach in the professional boundary between her and pupil A’. Panel chairman Helene Mansfield said the teacher’s arguments were ‘unconvincing’. She had displayed ‘a lack of awareness of her responsibilities and abused a position of trust’. The panel chairman acknowledged that the teenager had been a former pupil at the time of the incident, ‘albeit by a few days’. The disciplinary hearing ruled that Mrs Horton had engaged in an inappropriate and sexual relationship with the pupil that amounted to misconduct. She was given an indefinite prohibition order and told she would have to wait two years before reapplying to teach.","Clare Horton, 33, drove teenager to her home for sexual encounter .

"By . Sam Webb . This is the heart-warming moment Spanish reporter Javier Espinosa is reunited with his son Yerai after six months being held captive in Syria by a rogue Al Qaeda group. As Espinosa walked down the steps from the plane, his young son raced across the tarmac and threw his arms around his father in a bear hug. The El Mundo newspaper reported earlier that the war correspondent made contact late Saturday from Turkey, where he and photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova were under military protection. It was not clear whether the journalists had escaped or were released by the extremist Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, which abducted the pair at a checkpoint in northeastern Syria on September 16 as they were trying to leave the country. Spanish reporter Javier Espinosa, reacts as his son Yerai runs towards him upon his arrival at the military airport of Torrejon in Madrid, Spain.

Nearly 30 journalists have been killed there since the conflict began in March 2011, while dozens more have been kidnapped by both rebels and pro-government forces. Most of the kidnappings in the past year have taken place in rebel-held territories, particularly in chaotic northern and eastern Syria, where the Islamic State has a presence. With the two Spanish correspondents now free, there are at least nine more foreign reporters still missing in Syria as well as 10 Syrian journalists. For friends and family, word of the journalists' freedom was reason to rejoice after months of stress. Monica Garcia Prieto, Espinosa's partner, put it simply in a succinct Tweet: 'Pure happiness'. The two journalists flew back to Madrid Sunday on a Spanish government aircraft, the Defense Ministry said. At a hastily-convened news conference Sunday at El Mundo newspaper's Madrid headquarters, Espinosa and Garcia Vilanova received a standing ovation. They thanked those present for their support, but said they could not provide details of their captivity or how they won their freedom, saying the matter was 'out of our hands'. Pedro J.

Most of the kidnappings in the past year have taken place in rebel-held territories, particularly in chaotic northern and eastern Syria, where the Islamic State has a presence . A spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said the government uses 'maximum discretion' when dealing with kidnapped journalists, and would not comment on whether a ransom was negotiated. She spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Journalists are not the only ones who have been targeted for kidnapping. Activists, who do much of the on-the-ground reporting in Syria, are also at risk. Reporters Without Borders says around 20 activists are held by the Islamic State, while an unknown number are held by the government.

Some argue they opt for product placement because funding is more difficult to come by for film-makers. This time, for the renowned character Superman, the film-makers decided to go big - kitting him out with all the latest branded technology and gadgets. So, where does Clark Kent get his glasses? In this film - Warby Parker. And his mobile phone is Nokia's latest model. In fact, when it launches this Friday in the UK, the new Superman, called Man of Steel, will officially scoop pole position for the most product placements ever used. Few brands wouldn't want to be associated with a 'man of steel' or Superman, like Chrysler cars . Vintage: Clark Kent apparently opts for Warby Parker's vintage-style specs . Apps: Superman's Nokia is even kitted out with all his own apps . Almost 100 companies have inked deals with Warner Brothers for their brands to appear in the film. From a marketing perspective, what company wouldn't clammer to be associated with the world's hardest, and nicest, man? The deals have earned the film-makers $170million (Â£107m); it cost them $225 million to make it. Quoted in the Independent, Ryan Newey, of the advertising agency Fold7, said: 'More and more companies are looking to the film industry to promote their brands, as films are a great source of integrated advertising. And they provide aspirational characters, which companies are keen to associate their products with. He added: 'Brands are a part of our routine - we receive 5,000 messages every day. If a film were brand-less, it would not be real life.' Whether or not Zack Snyder's epic will beat previous Superman films at the box office, however, remains to be seen. Popular: Superman actor Henry Cavill, pictured signing autographs in LA on Monday, is expected in London no Wednesday for the UK premier of Man of Steel . The highest earning Superman film to date is Superman Returns (2008), which took nearly $391 million. A close second was the original Superman (1978) which took over $300 million. Superhero characters in general have a good reputation at the box office. All of the existing Iron Man films have scooped top 100 positions for box office sales, while people can't get enough of Bat Man and Spider Man. The top selling film at the box office worldwide, is also a fictional character film - Avatar - which took nearly $2.8 billion worldwide.","Producers recouped three-quarters cost of film through brand partnerships alone .

"By . Sam Webb . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has taken the time to post pictures of his wife and smiling schoolchildren online, despite the bloody civil war that is tearing his country apart. The pictures of a grinning and waving al-Assad, his British-born wife Asma and jubilant youngsters appeared on his Instagram account, enraging human rights groups. The President's pictures were posted a short time after another batch of photos showing the harrowing state of obliterated cities like Homs was released. The Syrian president waves to crowds in pictures posted to Instagram, despite the horrific war sweeping the country . First lady: President Assad's British-born wife, .

The president and his wife taking part in a photo opportunity, while entire cities like Homs lie devastated . The Syrian regime posted these pictures of . smiling children. Human rights groups say the President is trying to . project an image of normality . More than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the Syrian conflict since it started two years ago . But as millions have fled the fighting to neighbouring states, the Syrian regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life-as-normal image for the President. In his Instagram account - where pictures were first posed on July 24 - the leader can be seen smiling, doing paperwork, meeting children and waving to cheering crowds. His wife Asma is also featured on the account speaking to smiling school children and tasting home-cooked food. An Amnesty International campaigner said: 'No . amount of photos or tweets or Facebook posts will ever wash away the . stain on the Syrian government's record' Assad greets a little girl while visiting a . hospital.

At work: This picture shows the leader reading papers, while across the country violence rages . Cynicism: Instagram users stated their incredulity at the pictures . Nadim Houry, deputy director for Human Rights Watch in the Middle East and East Africa, said Al-Assad's Instagram account was something different to previous leaders like the deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. He said: 'I think it is a generational thing, I am not aware older leaders like Mubarak and Gaddafi used social networking, but the Syrian regime has always been keen to show a business-like image to the world. 'I am not surprised by this account, but it is a parallel between the regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality for the people subjected to the bombs, arbitrary arrests, human rights abuses and violence.

Amnesty International UK Syria campaign manager, Kristyan Benedict, said: 'On one level you'd have to say that it's not surprising to find any government, even the rigid and oppressive one in Damascus, using social media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view. 'Image obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative stability is important in President Assad's ""love me or I'll kill you"" strategy. 'Naturally, we'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in Syria - of the torture chambers or places of execution. Seeing the Assads in hospitals only reminds you of the fact that Syrian government hospitals have been used as places of torture.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cat owners should buy their pets bells for Christmas said Sir David Attenborough . If you want to savour the twittering of birds in your garden, you might have to get used to the occasional tinkling as well. Buying your cat a collar with a bell is the best way to give birds a boost in the battle for survival over the winter. That’s the advice from Sir David Attenborough, whose love for birds is behind his Tweet of the Day programme for Radio 4. The Christmas Day edition will feature the distinctive call of the robin, the star of Christmas cards the world over and a symbol of the festive season. Sir David, 87, explained that pretty images of friendly robins hopping about in the snow hid the reality of a desperate battle to survive the cold months, when food is scarce and danger is everywhere – especially with cats on the prowl. ‘Cats kill an extraordinarily high number of birds in British gardens,’ he told the Radio Times. Asked whether cat owners should buy bell collars for their pets at Christmas, he replied: ‘That would be good for the robins, yes. The robin almost certainly evolved a relationship with animals such as wild pigs, which grub around in the earth looking for tubers. Robins would have followed in their wake, picking up beetles and worms. ‘And the likelihood is – though nobody can prove it – that when human beings started cutting down forests and planting fields, the robin moved over from the pigs and took up mankind as a companion. ‘And the likelihood is – though nobody can prove it – that when human beings started cutting down forests and planting fields, the robin moved over from the pigs and took up mankind as a companion. The 87-year-old's love of birds is shared on his Tweet of the Day programme on Radio 4 . Sir David Attenborough said pretty images of robins hopping about in the snow hid the reality of how dangerous the winter months can be for the birds . ‘That’s why, if you’re digging in the . garden, a robin will often pop up – and it will appear to be very brave, . because it’ll pick up worms and beetle grubs from around your feet. And . that’s very endearing, isn’t it?’ Cats, . however, are best kept at a distance. According to the most recent . figures from the Mammal Society, cats catch up to 55million birds a . year. Which is where the bell collar comes . in. It is the best protection for birds in the garden, giving them ample . warming that danger is prowling their way. In . a wide-ranging interview, Sir David also warned that scientists should . abandon attempts to bring extinct species such as the woolly mammoth . back to life. Japanese . scientists recently extracted the bone marrow from mammoth remains with a . view to resurrecting the creature, in a real-life echo of the movie . Jurassic Park. But Sir David, who encounters extinct . animals in a new Sky documentary using special effects, said: ‘I think . it could conceivably happen, but to what end? 'We’ve got quite enough . problems saving the species we’ve got without bringing old ones back.’ Sir David also suggested that conservationists shouldn’t focus on particular species dying out. He said: ‘It’s very easy to say “The giant panda’s disappearing”. What you should be saying is that the ecosystem of which the giant panda is only a part is disappearing.’","Sir David said cats kill 'extraordinarily high' number of birds .

"By . David Mccormack . The Indian diplomat forced to leave the U.S. this week amid accusations of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper has said she fears she may never get to be united with her family in the U.S. Indian consulate official Devyani Khobragade was allowed to leave the country on Friday after a month-long dispute over her arrest and strip-search on suspicion of visa fraud involving her domestic servant. She was granted full diplomatic immunity and allowed to fly back to India - just hours after charges were filed in court alleging she lodged false documents to obtain a visa for her servant and then underpaid her. Devyani Khobragade, 39, has she that is very worried she will never be allowed to the return to the U.S. where her husband and two daughters continue to live . Khobragade, 39, has spoken to an Indian newspaper about her ‘immense stress’ at leaving behind her daughters - aged seven and four - in New York along with her husband, who is a U.S. citizen and works as an academic. ‘I wonder if I will be able to ever reunite with my family, my husband, my little kids. I miss them,’ she told The Sunday Express. ‘What if my children choose to study and work in the U.S.? What if I can never return to the U.S., which I cannot now. Does it mean we will never be able to live together as a family again?’ she said. Khobragade told the newspaper that she plans to continue with her legal fight to clear her name, including attempt to have her case in New York officially dismissed in a federal court. Back home: Devyani Khobragade is pictured with her father, left, as she arrives back in Delhi on Friday . ‘I know I am honest, and I will come out clean. But we do not know how much time it will take and for how long my family will have to suffer due to this,’ she added. ‘I have come to India but my stand still needs to be vindicated. And of course, I have been separated from my family, and I am under immense stress for my children,’ she said. ‘I spoke to my kids for hours last night, and they are already missing me. The four-year-old asked me, “Mommy, when will you be back home”, and I had no answer.’ Khobragade was charged on Thursday by a federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered an outcry in India. She's accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper. The indictment said Khobragade had made multiple false representations to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker. Khobragade, 39, is accused of exploiting her Indian-born housekeeper and nanny, allegedly having her work more than 100 hours a week for low pay and lying about it on a visa form . Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York . She planned to bring the worker to the . United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General . of India in New York, according to the indictment. Khobragade, . 39, India's deputy consul general in New York, has maintained her . innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 . per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage. Her . arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she . was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants . before being released on $250,000 bail. In . a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an . arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic . immunity status to leave the United States. The . letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to . court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return . to the U.S. without immunity status. 'We . will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to . the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the . government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in . the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet . Bharara said. Devyani Khobragade was arrested last . month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her . housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour . In an . unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to . what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case . by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying . to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a . housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was . contracted to work. He also . questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment . of the Indian housekeeper Sangeeta and her husband Philip Richard while there was so much about . the alleged treatment of Khobragade. He . said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect . victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal . status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'. These . developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on . behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions. Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama during the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute . Philip Richard had filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in . July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, . a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani . Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions . or keeping a person in bondage.' The . petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family . several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire . consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get . them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr . Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in . front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of . what the woman took. Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also . wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and . wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, . because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on . foreign soil'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A gardener who was bed-ridden for three weeks after an injury excavating a vegetable patch has invented a double-handed spade which he claims takes the back-breaking work out of digging. Ivan Williams, 71, came up with the odd-looking angled design after trapping his sciatic nerve while gardening last year. Ivan, a . former judge on TV show Scrapheap Challenge, spent weeks in his . workshop building and testing prototypes as soon as he could stand again. Helping hand: Inventor Ivan Williams shows off his double-handled spade, which is designed to take the stress out of digging . 'I couldn’t believe that in all the . thousands of years the spade has been around, no-one had come up with a . better design,' he said. In contrast to the back bending and twisting involved in using a conventional spade, Mr Williams’ invention lets him dig in an upright standing position. It is made possible by double handles and a unique angled design that allows him to use his upper thigh and hip as a pivot point to lever the soil out of the ground without straining his back. Mr Williams, from Minsterley in Shropshire, said: 'I know my design looks a little bit unusual but it makes gardening so much easier, especially for older people who could remain active in the garden for many more years. 'I can dig like this all day with very little strain now that I don’t have to do all of that bending and twisting. 'You do still have to ""dig"", pushing the spade in with the foot, but then you pull back – using the body as a fulcrum – take the upper handle, lift up, put the soil where you need it and then use the lower handle to turn the soil over and break it up. 'It’s just as fast at digging as a conventional spade, if not faster!' Mother of invention: Ivan Williams came up with his labour-saving spade design after injuring his back digging . Mr Williams came up with the idea after he badly hurt his back while digging his vegetable patch with a conventional spade last spring. 'I’d dug about two rows, I went to turn and then my back went. It locked up and went into spasm. I was in agony,' he said. 'I’d trapped my sciatic nerve and had to spend three weeks incapacitated, on strong painkillers. I was so furious it got me thinking about the spade and how it could be redesigned to stop this sort of thing happening. My back still hasn’t fully recovered 10 months later.' Mr Williams, an armour and weapons expert for the documentary series Battlefield Detectives, was an art and design lecturer before getting into TV and film work. He appeared in early shows of Scrapheap Challenge – judging contraptions made from air compressors and old bicycles  – and has worked on documentaries such as Leonardo’s Dream Machines, Rescue Emergency, The Iranian Embassy Siege and Gladiatrix, the Discovery Channel’s programme about female gladiators. He also designed weapons and armour for the movie Aliens 3. His prototype spade is built from a carbon steel blade, a tubular steel shaft and a synthetic moulded section shaped to fit comfortably against the thigh. Step forward: An expert said the new spade design invented by Mr Williams could be 'an important step forward to safer and less tiring digging' The spade can be stored in two pieces and the blade attachment might easily be replaced with a fork or a weed puller. Mr Williams, who has made a video of his spade in action, is now looking for a manufacturer to take his design to the next level. Dr Les Duckers, postgraduate research director at Coventry University, who has seen the video, believes the spade could be 'an important step forward to safer and less tiring digging'. 'Ivan’s spade gives a clear advantage in terms of posture. It’s used with a straight back, which would significantly reduce effort. In contrast, the bending and twisting needed to use a conventional spade creates significant postural strain which is both tiring and dangerous and carries an acknowledged risk of spinal injury,' he said. Dr Adam Al-Kashi, Head of Research and Education, back pain charity BackCare, said: 'The vast majority of back pain is stress-induced like the vast majority of headache, and does not relate to any physical damage, disease or dysfunction. 'Digging with a conventional spade should not cause injury or persistent pain in healthy people. However, since kinesiophobia [fear of movement] is a known barrier to back pain recovery, anything that helps people get back to normal activity is better than avoiding activity altogether. Ivan’s previous small-scale inventions include a survival knife that he designed with the survival specialist Lofty Wiseman, a simple-to-use etching press for schools and colleges, and a multi-purpose wheelbarrow that is supposed to make loading and unloading easier.","Ivan Williams, 71, came up with the design after injuring himself digging .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A group of amateur gardeners has been told they must tear up a green space they created from an old fly-tipping spot and cover it in gravel. The local people, who live near Belsize Road in Hampstead, north London, lovingly transformed a spot which had for years hosted an accumulation of rotting, rat-infested waste. In its place they created a garden which boasts more than 40 different species of plants and flowers. Urban bliss: The group of gardeners made this space out of a rubbish tip in Hampstead, north London . Diverse: The green space, off Belsize Road, is home to more than 40 different types of plants and flowers . But the group has been told by Camden council that it is 'trespassing' on public land, and has been told to tear up their lawn and flowerbeds or face a hefty bill. The council has said that if they do not return the area to its original function, of being a 'service road' for nearby shops, they will have to pay £4,600 for the work to be carried out on their behalf. John Goodman, one of the gardeners, said the council is being 'aggressive and heavy-handed' and that he 'couldn't understand' its actions. Mr Goodman, from Hampstead, said: 'This is a space that the community has turned from rubble and trash into a lovely looking garden. 'All across West Hampstead and Kilburn we see eyesores created by fly-tipping. Before: This photograph shows the ugly state in which the area used to exist, when it was covered in rubbish and infested by rats . 'It's a common problem and the council should see this as the embodiment of their supposed eagerness to see more greenery in the borough. 'But instead the council seem intent on kicking us.' In response to the challenge from the council, the group launched a campaign to preserve the space, called Save Our Priory Urban Green Space. They were initially given a deadline of 3 December to destroy the garden, but after collecting 1,000 signatures the council suspended their deadline, and they are now left in limbo. In a statement released by Camden council, Theo Blackwell, a local councillor, said: ‘The group have not sought permission, and as such it is an unauthorised use of a service road. We have therefore had to act to restore the road back to its intended use. ‘The council is happy to consider requests for worthwhile use on small sites owned by the taxpayer, and have done so before but we can't gift land to people without due regard for what its purpose is in the first place.’","Gardeners in Hampstead, north London, transformed a fly-tipping spot .

"By . Sara Malm . A mother’s role in life is to make sure her children are ready to take on the world when they leave the nest, and the same rules apply in the animal kingdom. This brown bear and her three cubs were spotted having a climbing lesson by a pond at a nature reserve in Finland. After showing the little ones how it’s done, the Eurasian brown bear’s three cubs made their way up the pine tree. This is how you do it: A mother bear teaches her cubs to climb a tree in Martinselkonen Nature Reserve, located close to the Russian border in Finland . The bravest even climbed all the way . to the top, and perched on one of the branches while its siblings stayed . firmly on the ground with Mama Bear. The . family bonding time was captured by Lithuanian photographers Dalia . Kvedaraite, 35, and Giedrius Stakauskas, 38, on a visit to the . Martinselkonen Nature Reserve, located close to the Russian border. ‘A . female bear arrived at this spot with her cubs when several powerful . male bears had moved away from the area,’ explains Ms Kvedaraite. ‘There was plenty of action from the fluffy bear cubs as they were playing and digging up vegetation all evening. ‘Their mum was teaching them how to climb and they all followed her lead as they scurried up the tree one by one. Family day out: The Eurasian bear mother kept a close eye on her three little cubs . Mama knows best: Mother bear climbs up ahead of her young ones, showing them how to best get to safety in the treetops . Easy as one, two, three: One by one the young brown bear cubs climb up the pine tree trunk as they practice what they mother preached . ‘All the cubs were so cute and funny, but the smallest one was particularly playful and so adorable.’ Only a few feet away from the bears, the photographers were able to watch them play together for hours. Dalia . says: ‘Unfortunately, later that evening, this little family of bears . was frightened by a huge and very aggressive male bear. ‘This forced not only the cubs but even the female to climb up to the top of the 33ft tree. ‘They certainly put their climbing skills to good use, and they reached the top in a mere five to ten seconds.’ Up top: One of the bear cubs made it all the way to the highest branches of the tree, while its siblings stayed closer to safety . Safe and sound: Not as keen on height as their sibling, the two other bear cubs climb back down after their mother to relax by the pond . Adult . male Eurasian brown bears weigh between 550-660lbs and can reach around . two meters in length, whereas a cub's average height is just 2ft5in. ‘Usually, cubs only climb the trees when they see adult male approaching, as they are afraid,’ Ms Kvedaraite said. ‘If . a male bear appears too aggressive, the mother bear sometimes has no . other option than to climb a tree - in order to get out of his way. ‘It was an amazing and unbelievable experience. ‘The excitement from such an encounter like this kept us awake all night.’","Mother bear pictured teaching her three cubs to climb trees .

"By . David Mccormack . Liza Minnelli was originally due to star in the Pine Brothers Softish Throat Drops commercial that aired during the Golden Globes featuring Martha Stewart - but the Cabaret star canceled on the day of the shoot after making a host of diva demands and suffering an apparent ‘nervous breakdown’ according to brand’s boss. The 67-year-old star, and daughter of Judy Garland, was all set to film the throat lozenges commercial back in September, but unexpectedly cancelled at the last minute claiming it was ‘too much pressure’. Liza’s decision to cancel was all the more frustrating for the ad makers as they’d bent over backwards to accommodate her lengthy list of demands which reportedly included a $400 coffee service, black Egyptian cotton towels and two cartons of cigarettes, plus a team to do her make-up and hair at the Waldorf Towers in New York City. Scroll down for video . Martha Stewart stepped in to make a cool $1 million for a 30 second ad for Pine Brothers Softish Throat Drops after Liza Minnelli dropped out . ‘Producers begged Liza to leave her apartment, which was only a few blocks away, and come to the shoot. She refused, saying this was 'too much pressure,' a source told the New York Post. Pine Brothers boss Rider McDowell told Business Insider he turned to Martha ‘after our first actress had a nervous breakdown the morning of the shoot.’ The 72-year-old TV personality who rarely advertises products that don’t have her name attached was quick to step in and she on set within the hour. ‘Like a real pro. She was done in make-up within 10 minutes, and filmed the ad in 30. She probably earned $1 million in 40 minutes,’ said the source. Video: Watch Martha's old-fashioned soft-focus lozenge commercial . Movie star Liza Minnelli dropped out of filming a lozenge commercial at the last minute last September claiming it was 'too much pressure' The old-fashioned soft-focus ad has been running since October on daytime TV, but a high profile spot during Sunday awards show on NBC has prompted renewed interest in it. In the commercial, Martha walks into a room, introduces herself only by her first name and then starts to talk about the lozenge brand. With no soundtrack and a very basic looking overlay of the product, the whole thing feels distinctly cheap. It drew a flurry of criticism on social media on Sunday night with comments including that it looked like a ransom video and questioning if the entire budget had been spent on Martha. ‘While Liza had some initial conversations... they couldn’t agree on a script. So it didn’t get past that stage and all decided to part ways. Therefore [this] is a bit harsh. And untrue. Dallas Buyers Club star Jared Leto posted this photo of him with Liza last week after she hosted a lunch for him and co-star Matthew McConaughey .

A spokesperson for Pine Brothers said, ‘We prefer not to comment and remain big fans of Ms. Minnelli.’ Oscar-winner Minnelli, who has battled various addictions throughout her life, wasn't at Sunday's awards show but was in fine form just days before when she hosted a luncheon for Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, the stars of Dallas Buyers Club. ‘Honey, if you don't win the Oscar, I'll give you mine!’ she told McConaughey. Both actors won their respective categories at the Golden Globes on Sunday. The old-fashioned soft-focus ad drew a flurry of criticism on social media with comments including that it looked like a ransom video and questioning if the entire budget had been spent on Martha .","Liza Minnelli pulled out of a commercial for Pine Brothers Softish Throat Drops claiming it was 'too much pressure'

"By . David Mccormack . The manufacturer of the most popular brand of wrist-worn fitness gadgets has been deluged with complaints that their latest device has caused a raft of skin complaints including rashes, blisters and peeling skin which in some cases have left permanent scarring. The Fitbit Force was launched late last year and retails for $130. It is the latest device from Fitbit, which sells a range of activity trackers that can measure steps, stairs climbed, calories burned and sleep. Within weeks of the device launching last November, users started to complain about a rash appearing on their skin underneath the device’s charging port. Fitbit, the manufacturer of the most popular brand of wrist-worn fitness gadgets, has been deluged with complaints that its latest device has caused a raft of skin conditions including rashes, blisters and peeling - which in some cases have left permanent scarring . Launched late last year the Fitbit Force retails for $130 and can measure steps, stairs climbed, calories burned and sleep. It also includes a full OLED screen, while the previous model only had indicator lights . Concerned users have taken to social media to air their concerns and since mid-December the company’s online forum has amassed more than 25 pages of comments from concerned and angry users posting grim photos of the markings that have appeared on their skin. In a statement, Fitbit has claimed that ‘numerous factors’ may ‘cause skin irritation,’ including sensitivity to the device's stainless steel, which contains nickel, ‘reactions to bacteria that can accumulate in wristbands, or a sensitivity to the material of the band elastomer.’ The company has said it will refund or exchange the device, but on the Fitbit forum many angry customers are demanding compensation for visits to their doctor and creams to cure the problem. It is unclear what is causing the reaction, and some people who have posted in the forum have said they didn't have any issues with the Force's predecessor, Fitbit Flex, which also has a stainless steel clasp that contains traces of nickel, reports Consumerist. The key difference that the Force has over Fitbit's previous model, the Flex, is that is now includes a full OLED display compared to the previous model which only displayed indicator lights. Feel the burn: Since mid-Dec the Fitbit user forum has received more than 25 pages of people complaining about their latest wrist-worn product and posting grim photos of their injuries . Several rash victims have complained on the Fitbit forum that they had posted their complaints on the company's Facebook page only to find they had been taken down by the company . Several person have also expressed their anger at Fitbit deleting comments and photos posted on the company's Facebook page. 'It's just not acceptable that you pay $129 for a product and then end up seeking professional medical help for a rash that develops from use of that product,' said Susan Pomeroy, a 63-year-old fitness instructor from Lawrence, Kan., who said she went to the doctor last month after developing a rash under her Force. She was diagnosed with contact dermatitis and given a prescription for prednisone, said she was frustrated that the company hadn't made an official statement or warned people. 'I am concerned for the health of others,' Pomeroy said. The market for wearable devices with sensors that can connect to an app and collect fitness data has exploded in the past 18 months and Fitbit has emerged as the market leader. Market leader: Fitbit was responsible for 68 percent of the full-body trackers sold in the year ending Jan. 4 . Unhappy customers have taken to the Fitbit forum to voice their unhappiness with how the company is handling the problem . In a statement, the manufacturer has suggested users may have an allergy to nickel which is contained in the device's stainless steel back . Another poster on the Fitbit forum outlines the treatment that they've gone through to try and cure the mystery rash that has appeared beneath their device . According to NPD Group, a market research firm, Fitbit was responsible for 68 percent of the full-body trackers sold in the year ending Jan. 4. It has also received many favourable reviews from critics and earlier this month TIME magazine ranked the Fitbit Force as the best fitness tracker on the market after apparently comparing 26 different devices. ‘With a slick, OLED display, the streamlined Fitbit design, a broad set of features, and fully-automated syncing (at least with Apple and Samsung’s recent phones), you can’t do any better than the Fitbit Force,’ wrote TIME. Fitbit has released the following statement: . We are aware that some of our customers have reported a skin irritation from wearing their Force device. We conduct testing in order to satisfy a variety of internationally accepted standards relating to the safety of the materials in our devices. Fitbit wristbands are made of an elastomer material similar to many sports watches and do not contain latex. The Fitbit Force clasps and casing are made with a surgical-grade stainless steel, which is commonly used in watches, jewelry and other products in contact with the skin. As with any jewelry or watch, numerous factors could cause a skin irritation, such as nickel sensitivity (surgical stainless steel is an alloy containing traces of nickel), reactions to bacteria that can accumulate in wristbands, or a sensitivity to the material of the band elastomer. However, our customers are our top priority, so we already have been taking steps to make this right with any customers who feel that they have an allergy related to their Fitbit device including offering a refund or a choice of a replacement tracker. Fitbit will handle all shipping costs and will provide a refund in any difference in price.","People using the Fitbit Force are complaining that the fitness device is causing a rash to develop on their skin underneath it .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . and Rachel Quigley . The married French scholar whose naked body was found in a New York hotel room on Tuesday had been trawling through gay hook-up websites on his laptop before he died, police said. Richard Descoings, 54, director of the prestigious Paris Institute of Political Studies, was found sprawled across a bed in the Michelangelo Hotel in Manhattan and police are searching for two men who visited his room on Monday evening. His widow, who was flying to New York from France the day his body was found, told police her husband was 'really into men', according to the New York Post. Dead: The body of Richard Descoings, 54, director of the prestigious Institute of Political Studies in Paris, was found nude in his Midtown Manhattan hotel room . Couple: Richard Descoings with his wife Nadia, who said she was aware of her husband's homosexuality before and when she married him . Sources told the paper that Nadia . Marik-Descoings said she was aware of her husband's homosexual interests . 'before she met and married him'. The couple attended a function in France when George Bush welcomed Nicolas Sarkozy . The French academic - who is a friend of President Sarkozy - had recently believed there was a 'plot' against him. His luxury room had been ransacked, and his laptop and cellphone were found on a third-floor ledge, possibly tossed from his window. An autopsy performed yesterday was . inconclusive pending toxicology tests. But there were no obvious signs . of trauma on the body.  Alcohol and prescription drugs were found in the . room. Mr Descoings was earning approximately $425,000 per . year as director of the Sciences-Po institute of political science in . Paris – a prestigious college where Dominique Strauss-Kahn once taught. In recent years, Mr Descoings had been criticized by some right-wing politicians for opening up Sciences-Po to . underprivileged students, often from ethnic minority backgrounds. This had led to what the married Mr . Descoings viewed as a smear campaign, which included being forcibly . ‘outed’ as a homosexual in Le Monde – the pro-government ‘establishment’ newspaper. In an interview with the left-wing . Liberation just two months ago, Mr Descoings was asked directly if he . feared a plot against him. Tragic: New York City medical examiners remove Mr Descoings' body from the Michelangelo Hotel late on Tuesday night . Respect: Francois Hollande, Socialist Party candidate for the 2012 French presidential election, signs a book of condolences in tribute to Richard Descoings, director of the prestigious Institute of Political Studies (IEP) He replied: ‘I reject any paranoia. It’s possible, but I prefer to be naive rather than to speculate. ‘What I see is that at a given moment, . they started talking about sex, money and culture in general. We had my . forced outing in the columns of Le Monde. ‘I do not see what my alleged . homosexuality had to do with anything. This also happened at the time of . my marriage. The answer? That I’m not homosexual ? 'No, nothing. When . you’re not married, no-one has the right to mention that you’re with . someone, it’s the secret of a private life.’ He had been due to attend a conference at Columbia University but did not show up on Tuesday morning. Colleagues subsequently phoned the hotel. When staff members first went to his room, they believed they heard snoring. One report even says that a hotel . staffer went in to check on him, and Mr Descoings woke up with a grunt . before going back to sleep. Scene: Reporters swarm outside the Michelangelo Hotel, where Richard Descoings, Director of the Paris Institute of Political Studies, was found dead . Out of place: Mr Desconings was found dead in a hotel room like this one at the Michelangelo Hotel . When Mr Descoings still did not appear . at the conference, and missed the 12.30pm check out time, hotel staff . waited 30 minutes before visiting his room again. Inside, they found Mr . Descoings' nude body and the room in disarray. Linked: Shamed former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn was once a professor at the 'Sciences Po' institute which Descoings headed . While there was no indication of . forced entry into his room, there were signs that more than one person . may have been in the room with Mr Descoings. Friends of the well-regarded academic, who was known for his push for education reform in France, said that he was depressed. Authorities are not ruling out suicide . but they are also looking into the comings and goings of one or two men . who were seen visiting Mr Descoings' room in the days leading up to his . death. The institute which Mr Descoings led, . known in French as the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (or . colloquially as 'Sciences Po') is one of France's most distinguished . academic institutions and widely regarded as an elite school for future . high-ranking officials and politicians. Because of his role in the French . government, along with his strong push for the inclusion of . underprivileged students in Frances' most prestigious university, Mr . Descoings was a friend of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and he . released a statement in the wake of the news. 'In almost 16 years as the head of . ‘Sciences Po,’ he made of that venerable institution, which he reformed . profoundly, an establishment with a global reputation,' Mr Sarkozy said. During Mr Descoings' tenure at the . university, the number of scholarship students increased from 6 per cent . to 26 per cent, showing his dedication to opening up higher education. The investigation into the death of . Descoings is the second major investigation in a year to be launched by . New York police involving a major French personality. Last year, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, . then head of the International Monetary Fund, was arrested after a hotel . chambermaid accused him of sexual assault. The charges against . Strauss-Kahn were later dropped, but he is still facing a civil suit.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and David Mccormack . Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, 27, of Wood Valley, Idaho, is alive but 'in diminished health' according to military officials who've seen a recently obtained proof-of-life video . The U.S. military has obtained a new video of captured Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the only known American prisoner of war in Afghanistan. The so-called proof-of-life video is the first footage of the Wood Valley, Idaho, native in almost three years. The video hasnâ€™t been released to the media, but Bergdahl was described by one senior defense official as looking in diminished health from the effects of close to five years in captivity. The video came to light several days ago and is believed to be relatively recent as it includes a reference to December 14, 2013. Bergdahl was taken prisoner in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, and is believed he is being held somewhere in Pakistan. U.S. efforts to free Bergdahl, including negotiating for his release, have so far failed. 'Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has been gone far too long, and we continue to call for and work toward his safe and immediate release,' a Pentagon spokesman told CNN. 'We cannot discuss all the details of our efforts, but there should be no doubt that on a daily basis - using our military, intelligence and diplomatic tools - we work to see Sgt. Bergdahl returned home safely,' the spokesman said. In the past, the Taliban has said they would free him in exchange for several of their most senior operatives who are detained at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Scroll down for video . U.S. Army Private Bowe Bergdahl watches as one of his captors displays his identity tag to the camera at an unknown location in Afghanistan, July 19, 2009 not long after he was first captured . Jani and Bob Bergdahl, the parents of captured  U.S. Army Sergeant, addressed a rally held in their son's honor in Haley, Idaho, last June . Bergdahl's family have issued a statement in response to the latest video: 'As we have done so many times over the past four and a half years, we request his captors to release him safely so that our only son can be reunited with his mother and father. 'BOWE - If see this, continue to remain strong through patience. Your endurance will carry you to the finish line. Breathe!' Last year they received a letter from him via the Red Cross, but no details from the letter were released as he was considered to still be in a . volatile situation. Bergdahl was 23 when he was captured after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province. Captive: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl has been kept as a prisoner of war by the Taliban after being captured . The U.S. government acknowledged in May 2012 that it was engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. The discussions moved in fits and starts because of U.S. concerns that any Taliban prisoners swapped for Bergdahl might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight. Last June, however, the White House announced it was willing to send five Taliban prisoners to Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl. Among the five prisoners the Taliban has consistently asked for are Khairullah Khairkhwa, a former governor of Herat, and Mullah Mohammed Fazl, a Taliban military commander. The men have been held at Guantanamo for about a decade. The former ballet student was seen as an unlikely recruit for the Army by some, but family and friends say he admired the military for its discipline and for what he saw as its role in protecting the American way of life, according to the New York Times. He was lured into a military life by the promise of travel and the chance to help people across the world. But two months after arriving in Afghanistan he was captured. Since his capture, Sergeant Bergdahl has been forced to appear in several propaganda videos for the Taliban, pleading for an end to the U.S's involvement in the war. It is also believed that he made a daring escape attempt in 2011. He jumped from a first-floor window of a mud-brick house in Pakistan where he was being held, and escaped into underbrush and forested mountains. His captors found him three days later hiding in a trench, covered with leaves and nearly naked, according to a report. Sources described Sgt Bergdahl, as fighting 'like a boxer' when he was found.

"By . David Mccormack . and Daily Mail Reporter . Los Angeles law enforcement officials have revealed that the drug found 'in plain sight' at Justin Bieber's mansion in a Tuesday morning raid was molly, a form of ecstasy, and not cocaine as originally believed. The drug was found along with the prescription sedative Xanax as police executed a felony warrant to search the sprawling Calabasas property. The warrant was related to allegations that the singer had been responsible for throwing eggs at a neighbor's home in an exclusive gated community in Calabasas, California, last Thursday - causing more than $20,000 worth of damage. The singer's good friend, rapper Lil . Za, was arrested after officers found the drugs during the raid on the . 19-year-old singer's home. Scroll down for video . Twice in one day: Bieber's close friend Lil Za was arrested on charges of cocaine possession at the singer's home during Tuesday morning's raid - he was later arrested and charged with vandalism inside jail just moments before he was due to be released . Police arrive to raid Justin Bieber's Calabasas mansion after Los Angeles law enforcement executed a felony search warrant early on Tuesday morning . TMZ reports that what police originally believed to be cocaine was actually the drug molly, or MDMA. 'You have to analyze any evidence to see what comes forward,"" spokesman Steve Whitmore said. ""It may not be that particular narcotic,' said LA County Sheriff Steve Whitmore. 'Let’s just wait and see, but we’re fairly certain it’s a controlled substance,' Whitmore said according to the LA Times. For Lil Za, the difference is about two years in the slammer. Lesser crime: Sheriffs haul away Lil Za. If the drug that was allegedly in his possession was MDMA and not cocaine as was originally believed he faces a far lesser jail sentence if convicted . Whereas the cocaine could have landed him in prison for three years, the molly possession could mean closer to one year for him. Officials says Bieber was 'not connected' to the drugs. Aerial images showed the rapper being . led away by several officers before being driven to the police station . in the back of a cop car. Justin Bieber's good friend, rapper Lil Za, was hauled away from the 19-year-old singer's Calabasas mansion Tuesday after finding what they originally believed to be cocaine. TMZ later reported that police now think the substance in question is molly, an often powdered form of MDMA similar to ecstasy. A stock photo of the substance shown at right illustrates why police may have been confused, since the drugs are difficult to tell apart by sight . It was also revealed late Tuesday that, . in addition to molly, police say they found the powerful prescription . tranquilizer Xanax. The difference between cocaine and molly, besides their effects, is the punishment for possessing them. While Lil Za may have face around three years for cocaine possession, he'll face a sentence closer to one year if convicted of possessing molly. Lil Za, real name Xavier Smith, has been widely regarded as a 'bad influence' on Bieber for over a year. He was supposed to have been moved out of the singer's home but according to reports he has been 'staying at . Bieber's Calabasas home for months.' Eleven L.A. County Sheriff's patrol cars were spotted entering Bieber's gated community to look for 'video surveillance or other relevant evidence' to link him to the incident. Eight people, including the singer, were detained in the property’s garage as deputies executed the warrant. In . a press conference following the raid, an L.A. Sheriff's Department . official said the singer 'had not been arrested nor exonerated' in the . egging case. It is estimated that a dozen deputies, who brought a battering ram, carried out the search looking for any evidence to . might link the singer with the egg assault. Bieber . was not questioned at the scene regarding anything except standard . search-warrant inquiries and would likely handle any questioning through . his attorney later, said Whitmore. Police later issued a press release about the raid on Bieber's home. It said: 'Search Warrant Served at Calabasas Home after Estimated $20,000 Vandalism on January 9. 'At . about 8am on Tues, Jan. 14, 2014, detectives from Lost Hills/Malibu . Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department began . service of a search warrant at the Calabasas home of Suspect Justin . Bieber. Bieber was one of eight people detained in the garage of his property while deputies executed their warrant on Tuesday morning . Lil Za, real name Xavier Smith, has been widely regarded as a 'bad influence' on Bieber for over a year. He was supposed to have been moved out of the singer's home but according to reports he has been 'staying at Bieber's Calabasas home for months' Lil Za was arrested for drug possession following the L.A. County Sheriff's department raid, the drugs were clearly visible when cops raided Bieber's home . 'The purpose of . the search warrant is to seek video surveillance or other possible . evidence in the vandalism that occurred on January 9, 2014. The . vandalism damage is estimated by the homeowner to be approximately . $20,000.00. The investigation is ongoing.' Thompson declined to describe what . evidence detectives took from Bieber's home, but said the emphasis . wasn't on what was in the pop star's refrigerator. He said the house . Bieber allegedly egged had custom wood and other expensive features and . that several thousands of dollars in damage occurred. Thompson added . that a judge authorized the search warrant. 'I get that the eggs . don't seem that significant, but it does rise to the level of a felony,' Thompson said. 'But a felony crime is a felony crime, no matter how you commit it,' he said, 'and this crime rose to the felony section, and a judge signed a search warrant saying we should go get evidence related to the felony crime.' 'There is a victim in this case who has extensive damage . done to their home. And that's a serious incident.' A source told RadarOnline.com that Justin was 'furious' at the raid. Taken away: Lil Za pictured in the back of a police car . Trouble: The rap star was wearing a black T-shirt and trousers as he walked with police . Eleven cop cars were involved in the raid on Justin Bieber's mansion in an exclusive gate community in Calabasas, California . 'He is obviously upset that cops basically had free reign and are going through his personal belongings in his house,' the source said. 'Justin has been kept out of the house while the search warrant is being executed and is being watched over by several sheriff’s deputies.' According to reports on Twitter, the police may even have had their guns drawn when they entered the Bieber residence. Maejor Ali, a music producer who has worked with singer, tweeted 'Thousands of tax payers dollars were just wasted by sending 12 armed officers with guns drawn in Justin Bieber's home to search for eggs.' It isn't known if Ali was in the house at the time and his tweet was retweeted by Kylie Jenner, amongst others. Bad influence? Sources close to Justin Bieber feared Lil Za, right, was leading the singer astray a year ago and now the rapper has been arrested for cocaine possession. Also pictured is Lil Twist, left . It is common practice to temporarily detain people while a search warrant is being served. In . California, if the damage is greater than $400 it becomes felony . vandalism. Whitmore said the egging incident was determined to be a . felony because several thousands of dollars-worth of damage occurred. The incident marks just the latest clash . between the pop star and his neighbors, who have accused him of throwing . loud parties and speeding through the neighborhood. The . search comes in the wake of last Thursday's incident, when a neighbor . called police claiming that the pop star had pelted his home with eggs. The neighbor shot a video during the alleged attack - which was posted on TMZ - and in the clip could be heard arguing and screaming at the egg-thrower. Splat: The door of Justin Bieber's neighbor's house . was covered in smashed eggs and police were called after the pop star is . alleged to have launched an egg-throwing attack . During the video the neighbor can be . heard shouting: 'I can f***ing see you!' as the footage shows the damage . that was allegedly done by the star. At another stage there was a verbal altercation between the pair with the neighbor shouting: 'What the hell are you doing?' Then another voice, apparently Justin's, shouts back: 'F**k you! I got another one for you, actually.' Justin allegedly hasn't called the neighbor to apologize or offered to foot the bill. Repairs to the property are estimated to cost thousands of dollars because the pricey Venetian plaster on the outside has to be redone. The entire front of the house needs to be re-plastered which will cost around $15,000, while an additional $5,000 is needed to repair the entryway, including re-staining the doors. Police arrived at Bieber's mansion in an exclusive gated community in Calabasas, L.A. at 8am on Tuesday with a warrant to search the property . Crack: Around 20 eggs were apparently thrown in the alleged attack . The neighbor 'heard something . banging against his house in Calabasas around 7:30pm on Thursday, and when . he stepped on to a second floor balcony... he says he saw Justin down . below hurling eggs at his front door,' reports TMZ. The neighbor's 13-year-old daughter then called the police upon instruction from her father. Bieber has had a number of run-ins with his neighbors. In March last year he was said to have spat in a neighbor's face after he was confronted over speeding in his Ferrari. The . Los Angeles Sheriff's Department were said to be investigating the . incident, during which Justin was alleged to have said: 'I'm going to . f**king kill you.' In November, police attended his home three times in one night when he held a major party. According . to TMZ, the noise got out of control and neighbors called the police . at 1am, the LA County Sheriff's deputies then allegedly paid Bieber a . call and told him to keep the noise down. In December, the singer announced he was retiring to spend some time 'figuring out myself as a man.'

"By . David Kent . The president of Bayern Munich, who has admitted evading millions of euros of taxes, hid even more income than he said, a tax inspector told his trial on Tuesday. Uli Hoeness, a World Cup winning player for West Germany in 1974 who has led Bayern to domestic and European glory, faces up to 10 years in jail in a case that has shocked his club's fans and prompted thousands of German tax dodgers to own up. As his trial opened on Monday, Hoeness admitted to evading more than five times the 3.5 million euros he had been charged with, around 18.5 million, hoping his admission and apology would mitigate his punishment. Support: Bayern Munich fans hold up placards of Uli Hoeness outside his trial for tax evasion . Downcast: Bayern Munich President Uli Hoeness arrives at court in his trial for tax evasion . Worried? Hoeness has a chat with his lawyer Markus Gotzens before the start of the trial . But a tax inspector told the court on Tuesday that documents he had submitted shortly before the trial showed the real amount was 27.2 million euros, a blow for the defence which hoped to show Hoeness informed authorities early and comprehensively enough to avoid jail. Hoeness told tax authorities in January 2013 that he had evaded taxes, but tax inspector Gabriele Hamberger told the court that her office had waited for more than a year for Hoeness to turn in bank records, despite repeated requests. A USB stick that the defence gave prosecutors last month contained a document first created a year earlier, she said, indicating it could have been submitted much earlier. A data expert will appear in court on Wednesday to testify on the electronic documents. Hoeness made massive profits on the financial markets, earning as much as 30 million euros in some years and held 150 million euros with Swiss bank Vontobel in 2005, Hamberger said. Early words: Judge Rupert Heindl speaks during the start of the trial of the former Bayern manager . Picturesque: A view of the regional court in Munich where the trial is taking place . 'We always knew there were documents,' said Ken Heidenreich, a spokesman for prosecutor Achim von Engel, outside the court. 'We repeatedly asked the defendant and his lawyer for the documents. Unfortunately they were only presented just before the trial.' Hoeness, 62, remains chairman of Bayern and intends to attend Tuesday's Champions League match against Arsenal at Munich's Allianz Arena, just 12 km (7 miles) from the courtroom. He told the court on Monday he was glad the tax evasion was 'all out in the open now.' 'I deeply regret my wrongdoing. I'm doing everything I can to put this unhappy chapter behind me,' he said. Tax evasion is a serious crime in Germany. Peter Graf, the late father of tennis champion Steffi Graf, was sentenced in 1997 to three years and nine months in jail for evading 12.3 million marks (6.3 million euros). He was released after 25 months. Hoeness could be sentenced to between five and 10 years in jail if convicted of evading more than 1 million euros in taxes.

"By . David Mccormack . Courtney Love took the stand on Wednesday in her so-called 'Twibel' trial in which she is accused of libeling a lawyer on Twitter. The Hole frontwoman is being sued by her one-time lawyer, Rhonda Holmes, after Love posted a tweet in 2010 that suggested Holmes had been ‘bought off’. The emotional musician told her lawyer on Wednesday that she is useless with computers and that she thought that she was just sending a personal message and deleted it when she realized it had been made public. Scroll down for video . Courtney Love has been taken to court by her former lawyer in the first ever case of an alleged libel on Twitter going to trial . Love said that her tweet was an exaggeration and through her lawyers questioning argued that the internet is full of opinion. Holmes’ attorney Mitchell Langberg said Love’s testimony affirmed her intent with the tweet. 'The jury’s really going to have to decide if there’s anything special about Twitter,' Langberg said. 'When . you make false statements a fact about someone that hurt their . reputation, are you responsible for them, just like you would be . anyplace else?' At the time, Love had retained Holmes and her San Diego firm, Gordon & Holmes, to pursue a fraud case against the executors of her late husband Kurt Cobain’s estate. Holmes sued Love in May 2011 over the tweet sent from the now suspended @CourtneyLoveUK account. ‘@noozjunkie I was f***ing devastated when Rhonda J Holmes Esq of san diego was bought off @fairnewsspears perhaps you can get a quote,’ she tweeted. Gordon & Holmes claim Love defamed it online after it stipulated that the singer ‘remain clean and sober’ while it represented her case, reports Spin. The case dates back to a tweet sent by Love in 2010 in which she suggested Rhonda Holmes, left, had been 'bought off' Yet according to the complaint, ‘There was never any indication Love honored this condition,’ which allegedly ‘caused Love to become angry with plaintiffs.’ While a number of Twitter-related libel cases have been filed in the past few years - including one in 2009 involving Love that was settled out of court - none before have gone to trial. When she took the witness stand on Wednesday, Love, 49, said the tweet was merely an opinion and that the internet is full of hyperbole and exaggeration. Love said she thought she was only tweeting it to two people. Last month, Love claimed that her tweet was not defamatory because, in the context of the internet, it represents an opinion. However, Judge Michael Johnson did not agree and sent the case to trial. The . trial, originally scheduled to finish up by the end of next week, is . expected to continue for at least a few days beyond that. The offending tweet was send from the now defunct @CourtneyLoveUK account and the singer now tweets as @Courtney . The verdict in this case could have serious . repercussions for all Twitter users if Courtney Love is found guilty of defaming . her former attorney. ‘The Courtney Love Twitter lawsuit is . monumental because the judge has now determined that tweeting in . California can potentially give rise to liability under the theory of . defamation,’ attorney Brian Claypool told ABC. ‘The . Courtney Love case will set a precedent that will result in, . potentially, the average person being liable as well,’ he added. The . case could also re-write the rules for much-loved celebrity Twitter . wars that have made headlines over the years such as Miley Cyrus vs. Sinead .

"By . Graeme Yorke . Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness stunned a German court on Monday by admitting he had evaded taxes of €18.5million (£15.4million) using a secret Swiss bank account - more than five times the amount on a prosecutors' charge sheet. Once one of Germany's most admired managers, Hoeness apologised and appealed for leniency at the start of a trial in a case that shocked the country and prompted other tax dodgers to turn themselves in. State prosecutor Achim von Engel read the charge sheet in which he was accused of evading €3.5m (£2.9m) in taxes - on undeclared income of €33.5m between 2003 and 2009. Support: Bayern Munich fans hold up placards of Uli Hoeness outside his trial for tax evasion . Hoeness, who turned Bayern Munich into . a success on and off the pitch before his fall from grace, could be . sentenced to between five and 10 years in jail if convicted of evading . more than €1m in taxes. 'I'm . glad that this is all out in the open now,' 62-year-old Hoeness, who . was wearing a dark suit and smiling nervously, told the court. 'I deeply . regret my wrongdoing. I'm doing everything I can to put this unhappy . chapter behind me.' Hoeness, . who as a player won the World Cup with West Germany in 1974 and as . manager led Bayern Munich to two Champions Leagues and many . domestic league titles, is hoping the voluntary disclosure will help him . avoid jail. He paid €10m to the tax office in January 2013, and says he voluntarily . alerted tax authorities then about his Swiss bank account and . undeclared income. What is unclear is whether he informed the tax office . about his offence early enough or comprehensively enough to avoid jail. Downcast: Bayern Munich President Uli Hoeness arrives at court in his trial for tax evasion . Worried? Hoeness has a chat with his lawyer Markus Gotzens before the start of the trial . German legal experts say it appears unlikely he fulfilled those requirements. About . 100 journalists and spectators packed into the courtroom to witness the . start of the four-day trial. Outside the courtroom Bayern Munich fans . held up posters expressing their support for Hoeness and pleading for . leniency. Hoeness told the . court he used his secret account for more than 50,000 speculative trades . in financial markets such as foreign exchange and derivatives from 2001 . to 2010. He said he lost €1m between 2003 and 2009. 'It . was always clear to me that the account was mainly for gambling,' he . said. 'It was a real kick, pure adrenaline. I lost track of it all. Everything was a real mess in the end.' Early words: Judge Rupert Heindl speaks during the start of the trial of the former Bayern manager . Hoeness . said he was disappointed that the state prosecutors raided his house . and arrested him before charging him with tax evasion after his . voluntary disclosure in 2013. He said he had received death threats when . the public learned of his case. 'The . consequences of all this for me and my family have been a disaster,' said Hoeness, and he had donated more than five million to charity . in past years and paid more than €50m euros in taxes in Germany, . he said. 'I'm not a social parasite,' he said in response to the criticism that by evading taxes he cheated other taxpayers. The . case against Hoeness, and other celebrities caught or confessing to tax . evasion, led thousands to preemptively pay back taxes in the hope of . avoiding prosecution, and helped change the public's perception of tax . evasion as a misdemeanour to it being seen as a serious crime.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and David Mccormack . The Miami strip club that lost its license in the wake of allegations that a 13-year-old sex slave had been forced to perform under the stage name Peaches has filed an injunction to get re-opened. Miami Beach city manager Jimmy Morales suspended Club Madonna's business permits for six months on Friday, while police investigate the circumstances around how a 13-year old girl was able to get a job dancing at the fully nude strip club. But club owner Leroy Griffith has refused to take the decision lying down and on Tuesday went to federal court to file an injunction against the city. Club Madonna in Miami Beach had its business permits suspended for six months on Friday, while police investigate the circumstances around how a 13-year old girl was able to get a job dancing at the fully nude strip club . The nine-count complaint seeks an immediate injunction to get the club re-opened and monetary damages based on the club’s out-of-pocket losses, attorney Richard Wolfe said. Last week authorities said they had arrested three people on human trafficking charges after they had forced a 13-year-old runaway girl to dance at the all-nude strip club. When quizzed about the allegations, Griffith said he had no proof that the victim had ever danced at his club. ‘Based on the gravity of recent allegations, the evidence collected and the owner’s admitted failure to have the required knowledge of what illegal activity occurs at Club Madonna, I have determined that this activity presents an actual threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the public,’ Morales said. He didn't know: Club owner Leroy Griffith says there is no record of the girl working at the club, and that he didn't know she was dancing on his stage . On Tuesday, Wolfe said the club’s closure ‘was done in a punitive, vindictive manner.’ ‘They didn’t comply with their own requirements set forth in the city code. The city code requires them to determine that there’s an emergency that will cause a serious danger to the citizens of Miami Beach. That didn’t occur,’ Wolfe told NBC. Griffith still maintains that what happened involving the 13-year-old girl was a one-time incident, if indeed it occurred. ‘But if this girl did dance, she danced, it’s an isolated instance, it’s not indicative of the manner in which this club has operated lawfully for 40 years, and proper safeguards have been put in place to make sure it would never happen again,’ Wolfe said. ‘The city manager was overreaching in the manner in which he shut down the business with the stroke of a pen.’ The accused: (L to R) DeWayne Ward, 18, Marlene San Vincente, 22, and Vilbert Jean, 36, were arrested last week . City spokeswoman Nannette Rodriguez said the city stands by Morales’ comments from Friday. Griffith, who has owned Madonna for 40 years ago, claims he was on a New Year's cruise during the time period that the minor worked at the club, and his head manager, on the job only two months, was also on holiday. Dancers at the club are supposed to sign contracts and provide identification to prove that they’re at least 18 years old, which is then kept on file. He told the Miami Herald he has neither for the 13-year-old and that she provided the manager on duty with ID that proved she was 18. According to police, however, the girl claimed the club's managers never asked her for anything to verify her age. The girl told police she worked the club on Dec. 27 and 28 and Jan. 2, 3 and 4. Each night she was forced to turn over her earnings, ranging from $120 to $500 a night. Charged: Mr Ward, pictured in court, faces several charges related to human trafficking for his role in the scheme . Police have executed search warrants and . collected the club's video tapes and other evidence to determine whether . the girl actually did take the stage and whether she performed lap . dances. The three people accused of forcing the young runaway into a life of sex slavery after scooping . her up off a Miami Beach street last month are Vilbert Jean, 36, Marlene San Vincente, 22, and DeWayne . Ward, 18. The trio forced her to have sex for money on at least one . occasion, before forcing her to strip at Club Madonna on the South Beach Strip, . according to an affidavit cited by the Miami Herald. The girl, identified only as D.J. in the affidavit, was held . against her will by the gun-toting trio and plied with drugs and alcohol, . police said in the report. She ran away from home and was reported missing on . December 10. She and two 15-year-old friends shacked up at a seedy motel . in North Miami. They soon met a man referred to only as AP, he brought them to . a nearby home. The two other girls were dismissed for being too young, but . D.J. insisted she was 18, said the report. Club Madonna owner Leroy Griffith filed an injunction against Miami Beach on Tuesday and is demanding that his club is re-opened and his losses covered . Ward had sex with the teen at least six times and she was . also forced to have sex with a man at a motel for $80, the affidavit said. Her captors did not give her any of the money, and forced . her to strip when she railed against having sex for money, the report said. Ms San Vicente, who already danced for cash at the all-nude . club, forced her to spend her nights on stage, according to the affidavit. The minor was given ‘exotic clothing’ by the woman, she even . had her hair and nails done - she sometimes made as much as $500 a night. The trio reportedly took all of it. They also held her . hostage with an AK-47 assault rifle, a .40-caliber handgun and threatened her . with bodily harm, police alleged. The girl told police she worked the club on Dec. 27 and 28 and Jan. 2, 3 and 4 earning between $120 and $500 a night . The firearms and large amounts of marijuana and alcohol were . recovered from the home after the girl managed to escape last week and her . mother called police, according to CBS Miami. Authorities have not arrested any other club employees, but . say in the arrest report that the girl was never asked to provide proof of her . age. ‘The minor victim was never asked, nor did she ever provide . the Madonna club management any identification to verify her age,’ cops said. The club's attorney said there is no evidence . the girl ever worked at Madonna. ‘We have no record of her signing in,’ said Wolfe. ‘We have no payroll record of her working. All the other girls signed . contracts, we have no contract from this girl.’ Hostage: The young girl was held against her will, forced to have sex with Mr Ward multiple times, threatened with violence and drugged in this home, police say . Club owner Griffith also said he had no idea the girl . was at the club. ‘What happened to us is one of the dancers called up and . said ‘I’m going to come back and dance. Can I bring a friend?’ he told the . Herald. ‘You know, there are 40 or 50 girls walking in and out of the club.’ Though he doesn’t recall the girl working in his club, . authorities say she was on stage from Dec 13 to Jan 4, he lamented the young . girl’s plight. ‘I feel bad about it,’ the club owner told Local 10. ‘We're . having meetings about it right now.’ The club was fully cooperating with police. ‘We’re working with them, we want to get to the bottom as . much as you do,’ Griffith told CBS Miami. Each of the three has been charged with human trafficking, . lewd and lascivious conduct on a person under 16, delivering a controlled . substance to a person under 18 and contributing to the delinquency of a minor . They are being held in Dade County Jail. The young girl is back with her family.","Club Madonna had its license suspended for six months on Friday after allegations that a minor performed at the nude strip club as a dancer .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated Press . Angry residents in Charleston, West Virginia, have post disturbing photos online of the contaminated water flowing from their taps as they attempt to flush their pipes clean in the wake of last Thursday's chemical spill. It is almost a week since more than 300,000 West Virginians were left without water after a storage facility leaked several thousand gallons of a coal-processing chemical located upstream from the town's water treatment plant. While the water ban has now been partially lifted and some residents have been allowed to run their water in order to 'flush' the system, many are still waiting for officials to tell them their tap water is safe. Scroll down for video . The photo was taken on the first day that residents in Zone 1 where told they should run the taps in their home in order to 'flush' the system . A number of local people have documented the effects of the chemical spill on the water coming out of their taps in a series of photographs which show discolored and oily water which some have described as smelling like antifreeze. So far, about 40 percent of West Virginia American Water's customers have been allowed to use their water again after a chemical spilled into the Elk River on Thursday, state officials said on Tuesday night. Customers are asked to flush out . their systems before using the water again. Officials cautioned the . water could still have an odor, but they claim it is safe. More than 200 restaurants have reopened where the ban has been lifted, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, and all hospitals but one had running water by Tuesday, Tomblin said. The exception was Boone Memorial Hospital in Madison, the governor said. 'Here's what the oily tap water looks like in West Virginia & smells like antifreeze strongly,' tweeted Maria Armada . There were still some areas on the edges . of the water system with chemical levels exceeding the acceptable . amount, said West Virginia National Guard Adjutant Gen. James A. Hoyer. Schools in all four counties in the . affected areas remain closed on Wednesday. Tomblin did not provide a . timeline for when school will resume. The emergency closed schools, restaurants and businesses because they, along with about 300,000 residents, were told not to drink, shower or even wash clothes with the contaminated water. Matthew Davis said his neighborhood was still waiting for the ban to be lifted. After rinsing off at a nearby creek last week, he finally enjoyed a hot shower on Tuesday at his fiancee's house 30 minutes away. Davis, 21, had his wisdom teeth removed just before the water ban. ‘Pretty much all I had was Coke, and that hurt,’ Davis said. Officials cautioned that even water that was deemed safe may still have a slight licorice-type odor, raising the anxieties of some. Al Jones of the West Virginia department of General Services tests the water as he flushes the faucet and opens a rest room on the first floor of the State Capitol in Charleston on Monday . Erin Brockovich, who helped the illness-plagued town of Hinkley, California win $300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she will lend her expertise in West Virginia . Beverly Farrow also took a shower for the first time on Tuesday morning after nearly five days without water. She got the call on Monday night from the water company saying it was OK to flush the water systems. ‘I thought, “Oh my gosh, here we go,” and all of the faucets went on. Of course, I have not brushed my teeth or rinsed my mouth with the water yet, I'm still kind of waiting on that.’ Bobbi Holland, another Edgewood resident, went to wash her face Monday night after flushing out her system. ‘It smelled stronger than ever and I was like, “Oh no,” but I thought, “I'm tired, I'm just going to bed.” But when I woke up this morning, there wasn't any odor,’ she said on Tuesday. However one homeowner showed just how toxic and flammable the water still was on Sunday by setting on fire a glass poured from his kitchen tap. West Virginia's top law enforcement officer on Wednesday vowed a full investigation of a chemical spill that contaminated tap water for hundreds of thousands of people. 'Water should not look like this': Steven Adams took this photo on Jan 10, the day after the warning was given not to use the tap water . Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said there was a lot of speculation surrounding the spill into the Elk River at Charleston, the state capital, on Thursday that shut off water to more than 300,000 people. 'We had an absolute unmitigated disaster here for six days now where people are without water. This is not only utterly unacceptable. It's outrageous on every level,' Morrisey told CNN. He said that his investigation would be designed to ensure that another such spill never happened again, and local, state and federal officials all shared responsibility. 'We're going to look under the hood, we're going to uncover all the rocks and we're going to let the sunlight in,' Morrisey said. Water distribution stations continued to hand out water and the water company said it could be days before the entire system is back. Officials lifted the ban in a strict, methodical manner to help ensure the water system was not overwhelmed. The water crisis started on Thursday when a chemical used in coal processing leaked from a Freedom Industries plant into the nearby Elk River. Workers inspect an area outside a retaining wall around storage tanks where a chemical leaked into the Elk River at Freedom Industries storage facility in Charleston . Complaints came in to West Virginia American Water about an odor and officials discovered the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol was leaking out of a 40,000-gallon tank. Federal authorities, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, have opened an investigation.Only 14 people exposed to the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in serious condition. The chemicals removed from Freedom Industries' Elk River site have been shipped to another facility that the company owns, said Jimmy Gianato, state Department of Homeland Security director. The facility is in nearby Nitro, not near a water source, Gianato state officials said late on Tuesday. Environmental activist Erin Brockovich came to Charleston after she said she received thousands of online requests to visit and look into the spill. Brockovich said she believes officers from the company responsible for the spill should face criminal charges. ‘It would've cost so much less to identify the leak, report the leak, fix the leak instead of ignore the leak. This is going to be hundreds of millions of dollars,’ she said. A resident of Charleston, West Virginia set a glass of tap water on fire to show the level of toxicity from a chemical contamination . A Charleston couple conducted a water experiment where they were able to set it on fire following its contamination with 4-methylcyclohexane methanol - which is used to clean coal . During the water ban, some people had put plastic bags . around faucets so that they will be reminded not to use the water while . others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant. Water . distribution centers handed out bottled water and trucks with large . tanks of water filled up containers for people to take home. So far, only ten people exposed to . the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in . serious condition, Health and Human Resources Secretary Karen Bowling . said. The chemical, even in . its most concentrated form, isn't deadly. However, people were told they . shouldn't even wash their clothes in affected water, as the compound . can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting . and diarrhea.","Residents in Charleston, West Virginia, have posted photos of the poisoned water that has been pumped into their homes .

"By . Patrick Collins . The location was unremarkable, a small theatre in UEFA’s headquarters in the Swiss town of Nyon. And the ceremony was admirably understated, with dear old Luis Figo indolently fishing plastic balls from a Perspex bowl. Yet the tension was undeniable, because they were making the draw for the quarter-finals of the Champions League. And the thrill felt strangely familiar. Some of us recognised that feeling from a hundred similar ceremonies involving plastic balls and coded numbers. We remember those dry, bloodless tones, informing us that ‘Number 38, Hartlepool United, will play Number 3, Arsenal.’ And we imagined the whoops and yells breaking out in the Hartlepool dressing room. They were the days when the FA Cup occupied a central place in the English season, when footballers and fans alike would speak of Wembley as if it were Valhalla. With the world watching: Ex-Real Madrid and Portugal star Luis Figo draws out Manchester United on Friday . Jubilation: West Brom's players (including the late Sir Bobby Robson, second left) hear they have been drawn against FA Cup holders Tottenham back in 1963 . Centre stage: Swansea City fans listen to the FA Cup draw in 1964 . A small experiment may demonstrate the current status of the competition. Ask a selection of keen football followers to recite that European quarter-final draw. There will be some hesitation, the odd mistake, but such is the status of the clubs involved that most fans would readily supply chapter and verse. Now ask those same fans to detail the draw for the semi-finals of the FA Cup. I suggest that many would struggle to come up with Wigan Athletic v Arsenal and Sheffield United v Hull City. For it is now a contest of small consequence, an event which barely registers on the nation’s radar. The FA Cup has become a competition which makes shifty evaders of upright managers: ‘You want to know why we’re putting out our third team? Well, our striker’s hamstring has tweaked, our winger’s grandmother has expired, and the work experience kid’s in goal on account of the virus which wiped out all our other keepers. Thankfully, they’ll all be fit for next week, apart, of course, from the winger’s grannie.’ Adulation: Wigan's matchwinner Ben Watson lifts the FA Cup trophy at Wembley last May . It is what we have come to, yet it . does not have to be like that. With a single, modest adjustment, the Cup . could regain its central place on our sporting stage. Quite simply, the . winners of the FA Cup should automatically qualify for one of England’s . four places in the Champions League. The idea is not original but the . alarming decline of the competition lends it a desperate urgency. At . the moment, the Cup winners are rewarded with a place in the group . stage of the Europa League, which is rather like winning the Lottery and . sharing the prize with half a million other lucky punters. But a . guaranteed place in the Champions League, with all that entails in terms . of finance and status, is a different matter. Overnight, treatment . tables would empty, excuses would evaporate and football managers would . start to tell the truth. In short, the FA Cup would come roaring back to . life. Naturally, there is a . snag, and that snag is called the Premier League. Suggest to almost any . of the club chairmen that they should voluntarily cede a Champions . League place and their indignation would be wondrous to behold. For . Europe is the place where profits are measured in multiples of millions. The prospect of Europe, however remote for some, is the carrot which enticed them to join their 20-club cabal in the first place. And yet, from time to time, this self-serving gang need reminding that the game is not merely a vehicle for their profits or their profile. The FA Cup existed and flourished long before they invested a single dollar, dinar or rouble, and if the task of restoring it to its proper place should cause them some slight financial inconvenience, then so be it. Clearly, the people who ought to be fighting this cause are those entrusted with the welfare of the FA Cup competition. But the FA’s record of standing up to the Premier League is not impressive. As the body responsible for the governance of English football, the FA had the power to shape football’s future when the League was formed in 1992. Tragically, they lacked the vision to dictate intelligent terms. Today, they appear to lack both the clout and courage to take on the men with the money. And yet, the stakes are genuinely important. In itself, the act of prising a European place from the hands of the Premier League could be seen as little more than a political manoeuvre. But the practical effects would be enormous. Europe's elite? Arsenal have not won a trophy since 2005 yet have qualified for the Champions League every year . Over the past five seasons, the fourth-placed Premier League team have finished 18, 16, 12, 20 and 16 points — an average of 16.4 points — behind the winners. Fourth place in the Olympics, no matter how close to the winner you are, does not get you on the podium. Fourth place in a Parliamentary election usually means a lost deposit. And yet, in modern English football, such a trifling achievement offers an entry into the European elite. It is totally illogical and demonstrably unjust, and the FA must find the nerve to say so. For 142 years, their trophy has found a fond place in the heart of our game. They have a duty to preserve its power and its glory. Responsibility: FA chairman Greg Dyke (centre) needs to fight for the Cup . Time to turn a deaf ear to F1's big noises . Motor racing has been attempting to civilise the fuel-guzzling, air-polluting affront to the environment that is Formula One. Engine manufacturers insisted that F1’s technology needs to be more relevant to their road car programmes. They, therefore, voted to switch from V8 engines to the quieter, greener V6 turbo. This, it appears, puts a far greater premium on driving skill and also allows the cheers of the crowd to be heard, something which was impossible with the ear-splitting V8s. We imagined that this enlightened move would meet with universal approval. Not at all. Bernie Ecclestone, the famously feisty chief executive of F1, declared himself ‘horrified’ by the change. Not loud enough, apparently; certainly not as loud as, say, the slipstream of a Boeing 747. As Bernie put it: ‘These cars don’t sound like racing cars.’ So he wants to make them a great deal louder. Bring the noise: F1 supremo bernie Ecclestone has criticised the new regulations on the sport . But if this may be passed off as the harmless eccentricity of an 83-year-old billionaire, then what to make of Andrew Westacott, who enjoys the title of ‘Australian Grand Prix Corporation Chief Executive’. He believed that the new rules detract from the ‘sexiness’ of the event. He complained that he did not need earplugs. Finally, he described the noise in the pit lane as being like ‘harpsichords in a chamber orchestra’. I note that the Melbourne Chamber Orchestra are performing Vivaldi’s Four Seasons on Wednesday evening. If our Andrew is correct, it may be well worth a visit. But we should not take him seriously, any more than we should indulge Ecclestone’s yearning for deafening decibels. Instead, we should hope that the reformers stick to their guns. And that all the absurd objections are drowned in the roar of the crowd. Winner: Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg celebrates his triumph in Melbourne last weekend . Some of the best lines in sport were uttered by boxers before a fight. From the dazzling soliloquies of Muhammad Ali, to the first man who ever said ‘The bigger they are, the harder they fall’, to that marvellously wry remark of Joe Louis: ‘He can run but he can’t hide.’ Tyson Fury has a mundane scuffle coming up, against somebody whose name escapes me. Sadly, droll witticisms are not Mr Fury’s style. So he made his point by standing up, turning over a table, and stomping out. Clearly, we are in for a feast of Wildean wit before the first blows are struck. Turning the tables: British heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury was lost for words last week . PS . Since we are not slow to criticise our football authorities, we must offer praise where it’s due. The FA have decided to mark the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster by delaying the kick-offs of all Premier League, Football League and Conference matches by seven minutes. The same delay will apply to both FA Cup semi-finals, reminding us that the Liverpool-Nottingham Forest semi-final of 1989 was ended six minutes after kick-off as the extent of the crowd tragedy became apparent. The gesture is poignant, sensitive and admirably inspired.","FA Cup draws used to be as thrilling as Champions League ones are now .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:43 EST, 5 February 2012 . The first alleged victim of two Los Angeles teachers, one who is accused of feeding his students his semen, and the other who abused two girls, spoke out Saturday. The girl, who was in Mark Berndt’s second grade class in 2008, came home from school and showed her parents a picture of her eating a cookie with a gleaming, light-coloured substance visible. She was transferred to Martin Springer’s class, where her father alleges Springer touched her on her leg and thigh. Familiarity breeds contempt: It was revealed today that teachers Martin Springer, left, and Mark Berndt, right, teachers at the same school accused of sexual crimes against their students, know each other . Accused: Teacher Mark Berndt with a student in 2003. Berndt is suspected of taking bondage-style photographs of children in his class . On Saturday, the Los Angeles Times . revealed that the two teachers at Miramonte Elementary School in . inner-city Los Angeles knew each other and took school children on at . least two field trips together. The parents of the girl told the Los . Angeles Times that they had chosen to forget the alleged incidences, . until they saw that Berndt was charged with 23 acts of lewd conduct. The Times reports that detectives . have records that the girl transferred from one class to the next, . according to a source familiar with the case. ‘As a parent, it’s very painful. I don’t want to know much more,’ the father told the Time. Berndt, 61, is being held on $23 million bail. School playground: A student enters Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles earlier this week . At first, there was no known . connection between Martin Springer, who was arrested Friday, and Mark . Berndt, who was charged with feeding his alleged victims his own semen . on a blue plastic spoon. But . now it has been revealed that the two schoolteachers knew each other . and had taken their students on at least two joint field trips over the . past decade, the Los Angeles Times reported. The case has shocked the nation and . thrown a chill into its second-largest school district, with 650,000 . students across hundreds of campuses. Detectives interviewed Springer and . the alleged victims on Thursday and had him under surveillance. He was . arrested Friday as he exited a school district building in South Los . Angeles, Parker said. Good citizen: This 2003 photo shows former Miramontes Elementary teacher Mark Berndt with Angelica Zuniga, who is holding a citizenship diploma given to her by Brendt . Detectives anticipate that more victims might come forward, he said. A phone message left at Springer's home was not immediately returned. Martin Springer was pulled from a . classroom at Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles and arrested on . suspicion of fondling two girls over a period of three years, an . official said. He will appear in court on Tuesday. The . arrest comes just days after Mark Berndt, a third-grade teacher at the . same school was accused of photographed blindfolded, bound and gagged . children, some of whom had giant cockroaches sitting on their faces and . mouths. Springer, who is from Alhambra, was arrested based on information that came forward after the first arrest was announced, Sheriff's Capt. Mike Parker said, but there was no known connection between the two cases. The victims in the second case were about 7 years old and allegedly were fondled in a classroom, Parker said. Springer was immediately removed and is expected to be fired next week, . Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy told KTTV.The number of complaints about teacher molestation has increased since news spread of the shocking allegations. Community shaken: Some parents have removed their children from Miramonte Elementary school where two teachers have now been arrested . Berndt, who worked at the school for 30 years, was removed from his position a year ago after a film processor alerted police to the disturbing photos. He was arrested earlier this week and charged with committing lewd acts on 23 children, ages 6 to 10, between 2005 and 2010. He was jailed on $23 million bail and could face life in prison if convicted. Meanwhile a lawyer has filed a claim against the Los Angeles school district saying he intends to file a lawsuit on behalf of an unidentified girl who ate a sugar cookie laced with the semen of the first teacher arrested, Mark Berndt. Beverly Hills lawyer Raymond Boucher, whose Beverly Hills firm specializes in sexual abuse lawsuits against school districts, religious institutions and hospitals, said the legal claim of behalf of 'Jane Doe 1' charges that the district did not take adequate steps to prevent Berndt from repeatedly abusing children after they received complaints about him. Parents have expressed fury that they . were not told about the horrifying photographs a year ago, when . Berndt’s was removed from the school. Yesterday authorities acknowledged that a 10-year-old girl claimed Berndt tried to fondle her as far back as 1994. Alleged scene of the crime: Police outside Miramonte Elementary school in Los Angeles . Prosecutors declined to file to charges against Berndt in the 1993 report, saying they didn't have enough evidence. Two other former pupils have come forward to say they reported strange behaviour by Berndt, in which the teacher allegedly moved his hand near his crotch under the desk, to a school councillor. As news broke about the second arrest, some parents removed their children from class. Ida Santana said her sister called her and told her to pick up her nephew. 'It's hard to leave our kids here,' Santana said. 'We can't trust the teachers no more. Now there's another teacher.' Several other parents could be seen walking youngsters away from the school. Santana said the family is unsure where the boy will be going to school from now on. The case has also prompted the school district to fire a high school teacher who is being sued over allegations he had sex with students. Vance Miller, 59, was pulled from his Hamilton High School classroom in 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported. A police investigation didn't result in criminal charges. But two former students, now adults, said the music teacher had sex with them while they were students at Hamilton.","First victim was student of both Singer and Berndt .

"By . Colin Young . Now read Martin Samuel's column on Joe Kinnear's departure from Newcastle . The extent of the chaos that engulfed Joe Kinnear's reign as Necastle United's director of football has now emerged after the 67-year-old walked out on the role on Monday night. The former Wimbledon manager left St James’ Park for the last time this week after failing to bring in a single permanent signing in two transfer windows. The deterioration of his relationship with owner Mike Ashley brought his tenure to an end and Newcastle currently have no plans to replace Kinnear. Game over: Joe Kinnear (right) left Newcastle after his relationship under Mike Ashley became strained . Sportsmail has learned that Kinnear’s role was causing divisions throughout the club. On Saturday afternoon, following their third successive derby defeat by Sunderland, players refused to appear for the traditional Man of the Match award ceremony in a sponsors’ lounge. When the message from the boardroom came that a player or member of the coaching staff had to appear in their stead, the reply was ‘send Joe Kinnear’. But the director of football, who had been verbally abused, along with Ashley, during the 3-0 home defeat, was not even at the ground. As a result of the stand-off, Newcastle ambassador and former captain Bob Moncur stepped in to appease sponsors for the event. Further details were published by The Independent claiming the breakdown of Kinnear’s relationship with Ashley had forced his resignation on Monday evening. The pair were seen at several games together this season laughing and joking and they had intended to attend the derby together but changed their mind following the sale of Yohan Cabaye to Paris Saint-Germain, and the anticipated backlash from supporters unhappy that Newcastle had failed to sign a replacement for the France midfielder. One that got away: Yohan Cabaye left for Paris Saint-Germain and was not replaced in January . Really? Kinnear claimed he was closing on Mohamed Salah despite the forward already being a Chelsea player . That deal proved the final straw for Ashley because Kinnear agreed a fee for Cabaye. The pair clashed last week following the sale for less than the £25million Ashley expected, believed to be around the £20m mark. It is also reported that Kinnear privately claimed Newcastle were going to sign Mohamad Salah last month for £25m after a deal had already been struck with Chelsea for less than half that figure. The hierarchy at the North East club had grown tired of the way Kinnear operated. How he told punters in the Hilton Hotel the night before Newcastle were beaten by Manchester City in January that he had £20m to spend on a striker, a boast that reached and infuriated Ashley. How he struggled with technology, such as using the internet, and had endless problems with his mobile phone. How he claimed on a train earlier this season as he headed to watch a Newcastle match that he had to call off a drinking night with Bobby Moore to wine and dine the Supremes. Missing the boat: Clement Grenier (centre) was lined up as a potential replacement for countryman Cabaye . Brief: Kinnear's short-live spell as manager came to an end shortly after his shock appointment . How he told fans not to worry about selling Tim Krul because he had three world class goalkeepers lined up. How he got the name of his own defender Shane Ferguson muddled up with former midfielder Stephen Ireland and called him Shane Ireland. Sportsmail has learned that after watching a Birmingham City game, he asked Blues manager Lee Clark about one of his players. It turned out to be Ferguson. Kinnear was appointed by Ashley as the replacement for departing managing director Derek Llambias last summer. His appointment stunned supporters who thought they had seen the last of a manager who had been forced to quit through ill health four years earlier. That turbulent reign eventually led to Newcastle’s relegation from the Barclays Premier League. No worries? Kinnear was nonplussed by the possibility of Tim Krul (centre) leaving, claiming he had other goalkeepers in the pipeline . That bad? Loic Remy (left) was brought in on loan but Kinnear failed to make a single permanent signing . Kinnear was brought in to oversee transfers and, after spending £33m last January on five French players, Ashley was eager to cut back on spending. And Newcastle spent just £2m on a loan fee for QPR’s Loic Remy. Cabaye – or ‘Kebab’, as Kinnear had humiliating dubbed him in his first interview in his new job – was sold last week at a reduced price and it was Pardew who had to answer the uncomfortable questions. The Newcastle manager, who had no idea Kinnear had quit until he too heard the news late on Monday night, will have to answer more awkward questions when he meets the media on Thursday afternoon. His hope is that he and chief scout Graham Carr will have more say in recruitment this summer. They are certainly all looking to move forward from another turbulent period in the club’s recent history.","Newcastle owner Mike Ashley grew tired of Joe Kinnear's approach .

"By . Alex Greig . Former New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner has used social media to hint at a comeback. The politician, whose embarrassing sexting scandals saw him resign from Congress in 2011 and lose the mayoral election this year, wrote on his Facebook page that he 'hopes to keep the band together.' 'What's next? I'll keep you posted on my plans. But I hope we keep the band together,' he wrote, noting that 2013 'didn't go as I had hoped.' Mayoral candidate: Weiner used social media to admit that 2013 hadn't gone exactly as he planned . The democrat became a national joke after explicit images he sent to various young women under the alias 'Carlos Danger' became public.He was called on by the New York Times editorial board, among others, to leave the mayoral race but stayed on until the end, securing 4.9 per cent of the vote.'I continue to be deeply sorry that my personal mistakes undermined an amazing campaign that included too many amazing staffers to mention and hundreds of volunteers and many of you who kept active from afar with ideas, contributions and encouraging notes.' wrote Weiner in his end-of-year wrap up post on Facebook. Long-suffering wife: Weiner's wife Huma stood by him at a news conference where he addressed his sexting scandals . Weiner expressed his support for incumbent mayor Bill DeBlasio and hinted that he may write another book in the new year. 'Our team has to be a font of ideas and debate. I tried to run my campaign on this theme and the response was amazing. (Who knows, maybe I have a third book of ideas in me!' he wrote. To Facebook friends and followers, he gave words of thanks for their support and for being 'an amazing resource.'The response was less than enthusiastic. 'Hey, bro! Don't you have some personal issues to deal with before you get back into public life?' wrote one.Another requested that he 'Please do not contact me again!' Lost the race: Weiner's ratings plunged after he admitted to having illicit online exchanges with women even after he resigned from Congress amid a sexting scandal . Many called for Weiner to take a step back out of the limelight and retreat from public life altogether.'You are so self involved that you don't realize that no one with any character or self-respect lost interest in you a long time ago. Your poor wife. Get over yourself and step out of public life. Let the real go-getter in your family be the face of it: your wife. She is 100 times the person you will ever be Weiner, start following her example and stop being a self involved douchebag. Please, for the love of god.'Overall, Weiner's message, the first on his Facebook page since he lost the mayoral election, was viewed with skepicism by those who read it. 'Your empty words conceal myriad mistakes, lapses in judgment and deceiving actions... You are not and have proven never to have been a capable leader for our community... Please, with all due respect - which is, in this case very little - retreat from public life. Perhaps then we can refocus on issues that require our attention instead of CNN reruns of Jock Shots and your hollow and recycled apologies. To your family, I hope that better days lie ahead.'","Former mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner wrote an end-of-year message on his Facebook page .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . Here's the outstanding stat of the weekend for you. On his full league debut, Nabil Bentaleb, Tottenham’s 19-year-old midfielder, made 106 passes. That’s more passes than any other player in the Premier League and he completed 93.4 per cent of them, too. That is phenomenal. Cool, calm, collected: Nabil Bentaleb (right) impressed with his passing as Tottenham beat Crystal Palace . Pass master: Bentaleb's successful passes are in blue (left), and his touch map shows his involvement (Opta) Going for goal: Bentaleb (right) curls a shot round Jedinak . Pass master: Bentaleb made just six fewer passes then Barcelona's Xavi (left) did against Atletico Madrid . He made 17 more than the next best, his team-mate Mousa Dembele (89), more than double Michael Carrick (50) and was only six shy of Barcelona’s pass master Xavi (112). People say anybody can make five-yard passes, but if they think that’s easy, they are kidding themselves. For a teenager to come in and play the way he has is unbelievable. Tim Sherwood knows him from the youth set-up and he certainly knows a thing or two about playing in midfield. But Bentaleb’s ability belies his age. He is confident and plays with a nice arrogance, as if he’s saying: ‘Here I am, give me the ball.’ It was a brave decision to blood the youngster, but it looks like one that will pay off. Johnson's week to remember . Adam Johnson has had a great week. It started with Sunderland’s FA Cup third-round win over Carlisle when he scored a wonderful free-kick. Then he came on as substitute against Man United last Tuesday in the Capital One Cup semi-final and won the all-important penalty. Now he’s the proud owner of Saturday’s match ball after producing a sublime performance against Fulham and scoring a well-deserved  hat-trick. He hugged that right-hand side, as his touch map shows (below), and he was so effective on the break. There was talk only a few weeks ago that Sunderland wanted to offload the wide man as they were not happy with his input. Gus Poyet probably thought he wasn’t up for the fight ahead and before this week I would have had to agree. But now it’s like having a new player. I have written in this column before about his talent and at times it has been wasted. People may start talking about an England call and that may be premature, but I really hope the penny has dropped. He has great ability and if he starts to show that on a regular basis, then the fans will be right behind him. Hugging the touchline: Adam Johnson's pitch-map showed his devastating effect on the wing for Sunderland . Curler: Adam Johnson scores the first of his three goals as Sunderland eased to victory over Fulham . Finisher: Johnson scores Sunderland's third goal as they closed in on a valuable three points . Hat-trick hero: Johnson completes his treble from the penalty spot as he grabs Sunderland's fourth goal . Threesy does it: Adam Johnson celebrates after completing his hat-trick and with the match ball . The SAS are back . It was a hell of a game at the Britannia on Sunday, and Liverpool were absolutely formidable in attack. They were almost more dangerous out of possession, sucking Stoke in then attacking on the break with real venom. Then you had the return of the SAS. To see Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez back at it was fantastic, scoring goals and setting each other up. Taking off Philippe Coutinho and sending on Sturridge shows their depth, and if you’re a tired opposition defender, it’s a nightmare. And what more can you say about Suarez? He’s like the Artful Dodger. He pretends to not be interested, pick-pockets the opposition and then explodes. Sharp shooter: Luis Suarez scored twice for Liverpool as they edged out Stoke on Sunday afternoon . He's back: Daniel Sturridge announced his return from injury with a goal at the Britannia Stadium . Everton's unsung hero . Ross Barkley, Seamus Coleman and Romelu Lukaku have been taking the headlines for Everton this season, but for me there’s absolutely no doubt who their unsung hero has been: Gareth Barry. It started with his debut when Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 at Goodison Park back in September and he has maintained a very high standard all season. A lot of Everton fans would have raised their eyebrows when the signing was made, but he has been a revelation in their midfield. In September he played in his 500th Premier League game against Newcastle, which shows you just how long he’s been a top player and he scored his 50th PL goal with a beauty against Norwich. He keeps things simple, but executes . them so well and with his experience he has almost acted like a minder . for Everton’s young stars this season. Main man: Gareth Barry has impressed all season for Everton and helped himself to a goal against Norwich . Losing control . It was no surprise to see Swansea with 61.4 per cent possession on Saturday. What was surprising was that it came at Old Trafford. It didn’t feel like they dominated and, for all their work with the ball, they don’t create enough. But it does show United’s anxiety at home. They are not playing with any freedom. Chelsea away next week is massive for them, but of the top nine United have beaten only Arsenal. They will need to be at their best to get anything from Stamford Bridge. Home disadvantage? When you’re in a relegation scrap home games are vital, but sometimes you can actually be better on the road. The bottom four played each other on Saturday, but it was the away teams —West Ham and Sunderland — who won. Home advantage helps, but there can be real tension and fear, especially if you concede. Away, there’s less pressure and you can counter-attack. That’s exactly what happened this weekend. Pile on! West Ham celebrate a vital win away to Cardiff that helps ease their relegation worries . Leicester are on the up . It's easy to forget about Friday night games, but Leicester’s 4-1 win over Derby was the performance of the weekend. They had pace, power and have a balanced and hungry squad. With a four-point lead, they look certainties to come up. The only thing that will stop them is themselves. Last season in January they were second, but slipped to finish sixth, so it’s about whether they can cope with the pressure or if nerves will get the better of them.","Spurs' Nabil Bentaleb could become a Premier League pass master .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Wisconsin couple have their hands full caring for two new additions to their family, after they adopted twin bear cubs that had been rejected by their mother. David and Lana Fechter, who run a wildlife reserve on their West Bend property, took in the male cubs from a Chicago zoo. And while they are small and adorably cute, the couple say the nine-week-old Siberian bear cubs are keeping them on their toes. Scroll down for video . Buckets of love: The twin bear cubs are being raised at a Wisconsin wildlife reserve . Curious: The inquisitive cubs have been named Lewis and Clark after the American explorers . At the moment the cubs are in an inside enclosure, and are being bottle fed, but when they are a bit bigger they will live on the Shalom Wildlife reserve. The inquisitive bears have been named Lewis and Clark after the first explorers to venture into the unchartered West. 'They're like a 2-year-old where they get into everything,' Mr Fechter told WISN, adding that they needed a lot of attention. 'They're already starting to get their own personalities, and we need to respect them,' he added. The cubs, who could grow to be . 1,000lb, will be given a large natural enclosure to live in, as soon as . they become more independent. 'We are going to build a huge environment . for them. It will be a two-acre pen with a pond and ridges,' Mr Fechter said. He added that the bears are friendly but 'they are still grizzly and will always have to be treated with caution and respect.' Bear hug: Lana Fechter and her husband David are tending to the cubs after their mother rejected them at the Chicago zoo they were born in . Playmates: The nine-week-old cubs keep each other entertained . Adorable: The cubs are living inside for now but the wildlife park's owners are keen to introduce them to a more natural outside enclosure . Nap time: Tired from all their exploring, Lewis and Clark take a snooze on a chair . Mr Fechter told Mail Online that Lewis and Clark, who were six weeks old when they adopted them, are the park's first bears. Although the cubs are relying on the couple for their basic needs at the moment, Mr Fechter said generally they try to raise all their animals in as natural an environment as possible. 'When possible we want the mother animal to raise their young, we only help out when need be,' he said. The couple have been running the Shalom reserve after buying a parcel of land about an hour from Milwaukee to preserve it. The 100-acre reserve has three miles of trails that visitors can hike through, or drive golf buggies on, to view elk, wolves, bison and other species in a more natural environment. With more than 200 native animals on . show, the park has kept to its founding philosopshy from when it started . in 1979: 'To preserve the prairies, wetlands, forest, lake habitat and . the wildness, while providing enjoyment and education.'

"By . Mark Duell . A mother revealed today how her eight-year-old son is ‘not the boy I know any more’ after he went through radiotherapy treatment she controversially fought hard at the High Court to prevent. Sally Roberts, of Brighton, East Sussex, who lost a high-profile case last year to stop the treatment for her son Neon’s brain tumour, said he ‘just crumbled into me’ after the radiation therapy. The 37-year-old said Neon has gone through 30 radiation sessions since the court battle and is now ‘broken’ with chronic fatigue, ‘grey and fragile’, ‘cries over the smallest things’ and ‘barely eats’. Distraught: Sally Roberts (left), of Brighton, East Sussex, who lost a high-profile case last year to stop the treatment for her son Neon’s (right) brain tumour, said he 'just crumbled into me' after the radiation therapy . ‘I look into my little boy’s eyes and there’s nothing there,’ she told the Sunday Mirror. ‘I see this child who was always laughing and happy sitting with his little head in his hands crying. ‘The thing that scared me most was that the radiation would change him, damage him. And it’s done both. The courts have taken Neon from me because I tried to protect him.’ She added that Neon is also now suffering from constipation, mouth sores and a reduction in saliva. Mrs Roberts described watching her son comply with doctors as he was strapped to a table and a mask placed over his head, wanting to scream and bang her fists against a glass wall in front of her. The New Zealand-born mother had earlier gone into hiding with her son because she did not want Neon to have treatment, before both of them were found unharmed last December. Troubled: Mrs Roberts described watching her son comply with doctors as he was strapped to a table and a mask placed over his head, wanting to scream and bang her fists against a glass wall in front of her . Doctors said Neon could have died if he hadn't have had the treatment, but Mrs Roberts insisted she was worried it could have done him long-term harm such as causing brain damage or infertility. 'I look into my little boy’s eyes and there’s nothing there. I see this child who was always laughing and happy sitting with his little head in his hands crying' Sally Roberts .

"By . Suzannah Hills . A trainee teacher hanged himself on New Year’s Eve after a split from his girlfriend, an inquest heard today. Keiran Walsh, 22, split from his partner of four years, Louise Doyle, so she could concentrate on her law degree. But when the pair met at a party on December 31st, Keiran told his ex: 'I can't live without you'. Miss Doyle then left the party but a few hours later Keiran sent her a final text saying 'I'm sorry' before he was found hanging in the bathroom at his university hall of residence on New Year's day. Childhood sweethearts: Trainee teacher Keiran Walsh, 22, dated Louise Doyle, 20, for four years before they broke up so she could concentrate on her law degree . The couple went to the same New Year's Eve party where Keiran hoped to get back together with his ex. When this didn't happen, he told her: 'I can't live without you' An inquest in Cardiff heard how the former couple both went to a party being held at Keiran’s student flat. Miss Doyle, 20, said Keiran appeared to think they were going to get back together that night, but when she told him that wasn't going to happen, they got into an argument. Miss Doyle said: 'Keiran thought we were getting back together on New Year’s Eve and after a few drinks we would be normal. 'When that didn’t happened he didn’t know what to do. 'When we were arguing he said ""I can’t live without you"" - but he quickly backtracked and said he didn’t mean it like that.' A few hours later, Keiran sent a text to his ex, saying: 'I'm sorry'. He was found dead in his bathroom the next day by friends . Miss Doyle then left the party, telling Kieran: 'I love you, goodnight.' He was found dead the next day. Miss Doyle told the inquest she always thought she would get back together with her boyfriend of four years. The pair 'grew up together' in Devon - Keiran was from Torquay and Miss Doyle was from nearby Newton Abbot. They travelled the world together and after returning from 'an amazing adventure, they both went to university in Cardiff. Keiran loved his course in 'early years teaching' but Miss Doyle struggled with the work load on her law and sociology course. In a statement read to the court, she said: 'Keiran was not happy that I didn’t have as much time to see him and I was really, really stressed so I started to take it out on him. 'We both wanted to make it work but it was really hard, I felt like I was being pulled in too many directions because of my course work. 'I said I couldn’t give him the 110 per cent he deserved and we needed to split up so I could have the space I needed to get my life together. 'I never thought we would not get back together.' The couple travelled to Cardiff to spend New Year’s Eve with friends at the university campus. But the inquest heard after a few drinks the pair started to row shortly before they were due to go to a nightclub. Keiran, who had worked as a fitter and a roofer, then tore down the pictures he had of Louise before telling her to get out of his flat. Keiran was found by friends the next day hanging in the en-suite bathroom at his student halls. The student, who has been described as popular and 'loving life', had no history of depression or self-harm. An inquest in Cardiff heard Keiran, pictured with Miss Doyle, had no history of self-harm or depression . Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how at the time of his death he had been drinking and was just under twice the legal drink drive limit. Coroner Thomas Atherton recorded a narrative verdict and said it was unclear what Keiran’s intentions were. He said: 'This has all the hallmarks of an impulsive act. 'Keiran had had an argument with Louise but he was also intoxicated and it’s very difficult to get into his mindset at that point. 'He appears to be a young man who had a real strength of character, he was not the sort of selfish person who would want to leave other people to grieve.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Georgia student is recovering after being being punched so badly by a fellow student that his nose was broken off of his skull. David Egan, 16, was captured on a cell phone video getting punched in the face by his attacker in a locker room at Parkview High School in Gwinnett County. After stumbling from the blow into some lockers, Egan was punched again and fell to the ground. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Egan's injuries required hours of emergency facial surgery, WGCL reports. '[David] had fractures all over his cheekbone, fractures which require a metal plate to constructively hold the bones back together, and the whole base of his nose was broken to the side of his face,' father Daniel Egan told the channel. 'His eyes were completely swollen shut.' Daniel Egan also said that the school called him to pick up David, as opposed to calling an ambulance for his son. David Egan, pictured, was beaten so badly in a school locker room he required emergency facial surgery . Father Daniel Egan said that David 'had fractures all over his cheekbone' and that 'the whole base of his nose was broken to the side of his face' Meanwhile, son David Egan says he doesn't even know the student who punched him, and that he was confronted over rumors that he stole the other student's sneakers. 'When he first hit me I actually said out loud, ""Wow, you actually sucker-punched me?"" because it was just crazy that he actually did that,' Egan told WGCL. He also told the channel that when he fell, others in the locker room jumped, cheered and laughed at him. Egan is now forced to miss school indefinitely. David is seen first punched (left) in the disturbing video, before he was 'sucker-punched' (right) and fell to the ground . 'I just want him to get punished for what he did because he wrongfully attacked me. And I didn't know him. I just wanted to get on with my life. I didn't ask for any of this,' he said to WGCL. Egan's attacker has been charged with aggravated battery -- but his father is not happy that the student has been charged as a juvenile. Daniel Egan wants Gwinnett County School Police to charge the student with a more serious charge, WSBTV reports -- and insists the attack on his son was premeditated. 'When they treat it like a school yard shuffle, you are thinking these are just kids,' Daniel Egan told WSBTV. 'He didn't throw sand in his eyes, he didn't stab him in the arm with a pencil, he broke his skull.' Father Daniel Egan, pictured, said that the school called him to pick up the injured Daniel, as opposed to calling an ambulance for him . David, seen here in the hospital, must now forced to miss school indefinitely . Meanwhile, school district spokesman Jorge Quintana said 'the school handled this case well' in a written statement to the channel. 'The student is a juvenile. I understand that this offense does not qualify to charge a juvenile as an adult in the state of Georgia,' Quintana said. 'Typically when there is a fight, 911 is not called as adults intervene. Injured students are typically taken to the clinic to receive immediate care from the clinic worker. Parents are then called. The school handled this case well, acting immediately to care for the injured student and to investigate so that appropriate disciplinary and criminal charges could be made.' The Egan family planned to meet with an attorney.","David Egan, 16, was punched in a locker room by a fellow student in a school locker room .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . The tables were turned on a graffiti artist in Brazil after he was caught red - or in this case, black - handed tagging the side of a police station. When the unidentified tagger was caught by police, the officer who busted him had something in mind other than arresting him: He forced the vandal to apologize and to allow the officer to spray him in the face with the same black spray-paint he used to tag the police barracks. The entire thing was videotaped and uploaded to the website Live Leak earlier this week. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tagger: This young man was busted spray-painting the police station near Sao Paulo, Brazil . Alternative: Rather than arrest the young man, the officer who busted him offered him an alternative . Apologize: The officer told the tagger he wouldn't arrest him if he apologized and allowed him to spray-paint the young man's face . The video shows the tagger on his knees as the officer lectures him in Portuguese. The sound of the officer shaking the can of spray-paint is heard before he sprays it on the young man's face for about 15 seconds, covering his entire face and head. The tagger then coughs from the fumes before he is forced by the officer to apologize. 'Say sorry,' the officer snaps at the tagger. Thorough: The officer sprays the tagger's face for about 15 seconds, nearly covering his entire face . He's sorry: After having his face covered with spray paint, the tagger apologized for vandalizing the police barracks . Lesson learned: The officer then tells the tagger to leave before he changes his mind about arresting him . 'Sorry, sir, I will never paint the base of police again,' the tagger responds. 'Now get out before I change my idea,' the offiser says. The young vandal then gets to his feet and runs off. The video already has been viewed nearly 125,000 times since it was posted two days ago. Brazilian authorities apparently take graffiti very seriously - anyone caught tagging a building in the South American country can face a fine and up to a year in jail.","The unidentified tagger was caught spray-painting police barracks near Sao Paulo, Brazil .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Green entrepreneur David Green, 52, hanged himself at his home on the Isle of Wight after he was arrested over false allegations of fraud, an inquest heard today . A green entrepreneur hanged himself after he was arrested over false allegations he had pocketed £115,000 of taxpayers' cash, an inquest heard. Keen yachtsman David Green, 52, left a note criticising police who arrested him on suspicion of fraud before he took his own life in the grounds of his family's eco-home outside Cowes on the Isle of Wight, the hearing was told. The award-winning businessman, who 'aimed to turn the Isle of Wight green' with his self-sufficiency firm, Ecoisland, was devastated after news of his arrest was leaked to the local paper. But the inquest in Newport heard charges would never have been brought against the father of two, as the arrest was based upon a misreading of financial documents by an employee at Isle of Wight Council. The court was told that Mr Green was assumed to have pocketed £115,000 of 'green grants' after council workers found the sum was unaccounted for after Ecoisland collapsed. Instead, it emerged that the cash had simply been swallowed up in the running costs of his ambitious eco venture, designed to make the island self-sufficient. Mr Green's widow, Patricia, 59, told a coroner how her husband was 'devastated' after being arrested on 3 October last year. She said: 'David had described the experience as the most humiliating and degrading in his whole life. 'He was a very honest and honourable man, so the thought of being questioned, and hearing someone at the police station call him ""the prisoner"" hit him hard.' Mr Green had told . interviewing officers 'I’m finished' after he was arrested and quizzed . for three hours at Newport Police Station, the . inquest heard. Describing her husband as a 'proud man who had achieved so much in his life', Mrs Green added: 'The day after David was arrested, the story was on the front page of the County Press... 'It just threw him.  He said ""I'm not going to be able to walk down the road, I'm going to be a pariah.""' She said she found her husband hanging in the grounds of their house as she returned from a walk with a friend on 7 October. Award-winning eco-entrepreneur Mr Green pictured receiving a sustainability prize from Caroline Lucas MP . Mr Green, pictured outside his house near Cowes, won awards for making his family home so eco-friendly . Mr Green left a lengthy suicide note condemning the detectives who had questioned him. He wrote: 'They clearly did not believe a word I said and treated me like a criminal. No compassion or innocence before guilt there, I’m afraid.' Mr Green, who was chief executive of the UK Sailing Association for 20 years, had won numerous awards after converting his large family home near Cowes into the most eco-friendly property on the island. He launched the Ecoisland Community Interest Company to make the Isle of Wight the first self-sustainable region in the UK, and the venture was backed by industry heavyweights including Cable and Wireless, IBM and Toshiba. Isle of Wight Council also gave him £240,000 of a Government cash grant towards the scheme. However, . the business ran into financial difficulties and went into . administration in late September last year, prompting the Greens to . decide to sell their home and 'start again', the inquest heard. Ambitious: Mr Green aimed to make the Isle of Wight self-sufficient with his green Ecoisland venture . The following week, Isle of Wight Council told police that £115,000 of government funding was unaccounted for - a conclusion they reached after going through Ecoisland financial spreadsheets. But Detective Constable Lee Stewart, of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Police fraud unit, told the inquest: 'The money had simply been swallowed up in the money problems of the organisation.  There is nothing to suggest it was fraudulently obtained.' He added: 'The factually incorrect spreadsheet - as perceived by the council - was in fact a misinterpretation of the material.' 'Mr Green was a decent man who had some financial problems, but there is no evidence... of dishonesty and that is the thing he would have struggled with most' Coroner Caroline Sumeray . Caroline Sumeray, the senior coroner for the Isle of Wight, recorded a verdict of suicide and told the hearing in Newport: 'I’m very sorry to hear the sad tale behind this case.' Speaking to Mrs Green and her younger child, Luke, 29, the coroner said it was 'horrendous' for them discover Mr Green 'felt driven to this by the humiliation he felt because he was arrested, because he was interviewed, because of the allegation that was made that was incorrect, false, inaccurate.' She added: 'I can’t begin to imagine how you are feeling.' The coroner said the police had acted 'properly' in investigating Mr Green following the allegation made by Isle of Wight Council, but criticised the council for releasing news of the arrest to the local newspaper prematurely. 'I trust there will be a full investigation and appropriate action taken against whoever provided this information,' said Mrs Sumeray. She added that Mr Green was 'a decent man who had some financial problems - but there is no evidence on the papers of dishonesty and that is the thing he would have struggled with most.'

Juneja Anwar, the caretaker boss of the takeaway, told Wigan Magistrates' Court that he was not surprised by the decision to close the premises. 'I can't object because of what they found,' he said. 'If I was a health and safety officer I would have shut it down too.'

Above, the storeroom, where the dead rat was discovered . She said she was shocked to discover the dead rat stuck between two freezers - adding that a lack of doors in the property had created a 'heavy rat infestation'. She said there was also evidence of rats gnawing away at part of the stairway, as well a mound of sewage overflowing onto the storeroom floor. 'There were three really obvious areas of rat activity, which is dangerous because rats can carry salmonella and e-coli,' she said. 'They can cause serious illness. Damaged: Ms Fish said there was also evidence of rats gnawing away at part of the stairway (pictured) 'This business should not be allowed to re-open until that health risk has been removed.' Mr Anwar told the court that the owner of Krunchy's Waseem Arshar was in Pakistan following a family emergency. He claimed Â£9,000 had already been spent on eradicating the takeaway's problems - with the final bill likely to be closer to Â£14,000. He said the fault with the drain had been caused further down the line - adding that Krunchy's had been told by a pest control company that there was 'no problem'. 'We thought the pest control company had sorted out any problem,' he said. Mr Anwar also denied ever having seen a rat on the premises, and outlined his intention to get the takeaway back open as soon as possible. Magistrates awarded the council costs of Â£1,870.","Inspector Lynn Fish found rodent's corpse at Krunchy's Chicken and Pizza .

A man who smashed a promising rugby . player’s skull with a claw hammer so hard that bone splinters embedded . into his brain, laughed and saluted to his friends as he was jailed for attempted murder today. Matthew Probert, 21, was left with . 'life-changing' injuries after he was attacked by Kris Bradley, 23, . after he accidentally bumped into him in a bar. Bradley was today jailed for 18 years, three of which will be served on licence, at Birmingham Crown Court. Pictures taken by bystanders show a dazed Mr Probert slumped on the ground with . the hammer  embedded in his forehead following the brutal attack on August . 31 last year. Bradley  - who had earlier wept as he was found guilty - saluted his laughing friends from the dock as he received his sentence. It also emerged that at the time of of the sickening attack, Bradley, of Lincoln, was on bail for two unrelated assault charges. Judge Melbourne Inman QC told him he would serve at least 15 years in prison before being released on licence. He said: 'It is clear that you were drinking on the night of the attack and called a friend for help. 'This attack was not fully planned but it was also not a spontaneous attack as it took place around 30 minutes after you were thrown out of the bar. 'You summoned help and armed yourself with a terrifying weapon. 'It is a very serious crime and Mr Probert has somehow made a remarkable recovery. 'You intended to kill Mr Probert and luckily did not succeed. 'The sentence I pass on you is one of 18 years imprisonment for this attempted murder.' Mr Probert had been celebrating a friend’s 21st birthday with teammates from Scunthorpe Rugby Club when he unintentionally bumped into Bradley on the dance floor of a Walkabout bar in Lincoln city centre. After leaving the bar, the young prop, who did not know the area, decided to walk away, but Bradley hunted him down. The court had heard Bradley phoned his friend Daniel Burrell, 23, of Lincoln, who supplied him with the hammer. Burrell was jailed for four-and-a-half years after being found guilty of assisting an offender. Judge Inman told Burrell: 'You were at a party that night and not looking for trouble. 'Although you made a very terrible decision to help Mr Bradley and it was very poor judgement on your part. 'Although the hammer was already in your car, you allowed him to take it out.' Matthew Probert, 21, is pictured leaving Birmingham Crown Court following the sentencing. He was attacked during a night out in Lincoln last year . Mr Probert with his father Mark. Bradley was today jailed for 18 years, three of which will be served on licence, at Birmingham Crown Court . A third man, Alex Taylor, 22, who was with Bradley when he attacked Matthew, admitted assisting an offender and was sentenced to 16 months in prison. The court heard Bradley sent a text to Burrell after the attack which read: 'If anything comes, just say my name, respect, love you mate, I’ll buy you a new hammer.' Prosecutor Tim Bowden told the court that Bradley would not have 'wanted a one on one fight' with the heavily built Mr Probert. He said: 'He is a prop forward, it was a night where Mr Bradley and Mr Taylor were drinking heavily and Mr Probert admits to mucking about with his friends. 'There was a slap to Mr Bradley before doormen intervened and they were sent outside. 'Mr Taylor was angry and aggravated and the doormen again separated everyone. 'Mr Probert walked away in the direction of Park Street, that would and should have been the end. 'But Mr Taylor and Mr Bradley were clearly angry and they decided to intercept Mr Probert. 'Mr Bradley called Mr Burrell to deliver him a hammer. 'Mr Probert is a large gentleman, it was clear that Mr Bradley or Mr Taylor wouldn’t have wanted to have a one on one fist fight, Mr Probert would have come out on top. 'Mr Bradley met Mr Burrell and collected the hammer from his car before he concealed it in the waistband of his trousers. Pictures taken by bystanders show a dazed Mr Probert slumped on the ground with the hammer  embedded in his forehead following the brutal attack on August 31 last year . 'Mr Probert was separated from his . friends when Mr Bradley approached him from behind and struck him to the . left side of his head with the claw side of the hammer, it embedded in . Mr Probert’s skull. 'That having been done, Mr Bradley and Mr Taylor ran back to Mr Burrell’s car and made their escape. 'They were all then later arrested and interviewed.' He added that Mr Probert was a promising rugby player who possibly could have made a career out of the sport. Mark Knowles, defending Bradley, said: 'He still maintains he wouldn’t have wanted to kill anybody.'He has not sought to try and excuse himself in anyway. 'When he woke up the morning after the attack, his text messages showed he had no clue what happened. 'This is a young man with a problem with drink. 'He apologises in open court to the victim and knows his behaviour was simply not acceptable.' After the attack, he was rushed to Lincoln City Hospital before being transferred to a neurosurgery unit at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, with the hammer still embedded in his skull. Mr Probert attended the sentencing alongside his family. In a statement read out after the sentencing his father Mark said: 'We are extremely satisfied as a family with the outcome of the trial against all three defendants and the sentences passed, to what was a truly horrific and unjust act of violence against my son Matthew. Bradley’s friend Daniel Burrell, 22,  (left) who . supplied him with the hammer was found guilty of assisting an offender. Alex Taylor, 21,  (right) admitted assisting an offender at an earlier . hearing . 'It goes without question, if it was not for the immediate and prompt assistance and first aid given to Matthew by the door supervisors and emergency services at the scene, the outcome could have been a far lot worse and therefore a sincere and heartfelt thanks must go to all personnel who were involved. 'Matthew continues to make small steps daily to a remarkable recovery and as such he has very much learnt to take every day as it comes. 'Let’s not forget the seriousness of the injuries he sustained and as such we are all very attentive to the length and time the healing process will take for him to make to a full and healthy recovery.'","Matthew Probert, 21, hit with such force bone splinters embedded in brain .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He's a classically trained actor and dancer who has made a living doing his 'best Obama' since 2008. And now Iman Crosson has finally met his, err, muse. During a meeting at the White House on Thursday, for which a host of YouTube personalities were brought together to discuss the Affordable Care Act with President Obama, Crosson not only came face-to-face with the man he makes a living impersonating - he got to show him the act as well. 'It was actually very amazing,' Crosson told Politico. Scroll down for video . Professional doppelganger: Iman Crosson has been impersonating Barack Obama since 2008. One of his YouTube videos (pictured) has amassed over 10 million hits . Likeness: After meeting his impersonator, Obama told Iman Crosson he 'needs some grey hair' Finally: Iman Crosson fulfilled a long-held goal to meet President Barack Obama on Thursday during a meeting at the White House . An excited Iman Crosson described the meeting as 'very amazing' 'That’s something that I had wanted ever since I began doing the impression in late 2008, early 2009, and to actually finally get to the point of going there was amazing. 'It was a great experience and meeting the president and getting to see the man he is, it was all around amazing.' Crosson was struggling with his craft and waiting tables to make ends meet when someone remarked he looked like Barack Obama, who at the time was running for President. 'I didn’t do impressions at the time, but I thought if I could be the guy who put an impression out there first, and he wins, that could be good,' Crosson said. 'So I went home and made my first video and posted it on YouTube, and it did really well. The rest is history.' Obama impersonator Iman Crosson not only got to meet the President, but performed his act for him also . The White House released a video of the pair's first interaction, with Obama seeming genuinely chuffed at the likeness. 'It was definitely nerve-wracking to do that in front of him, but to do it and see the smile on his face, and to gesture to his camera lady and say, ‘Are you recording this?’ That was such a cool moment for me,' Crosson said Friday. Crosson maintains his schtick is not just a spoof, and that it took a lot of practice to hone. 'I studied him a lot and his speeches and his candid interviews, his addresses, and the thing is when doing an impression of the president — because obviously it's comical — it’s a little bit more of a caricature then it is a spot-on voice,' he said. One of his YouTube videos, which sends up Obama's announcement about the capture and kill of Osama bin Laden, has received over 22 million hits. However, some observers are less impressed with Crosson's resemblance to the President, dubbing him 'Barraco Barner' in a reference to a mis-spelt tweet written this week by British woman Gemma Worrall which went viral around the globe. Accurate? Some have suggested that Crosson is less than a perfect impersonator, comparing him to 'Barraco Barner' in a reference to a mis-spelling of the President's name made famous by British woman Gemma Worrall, pictured .","Iman Crosson was a struggling actor waiting tables when someone remarked that he looked like Barack Obama, who at the time was running for President .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . Almost five years on from the swine flu pandemic, a mother-of-two who had previously suffered from no health issues, contracted the disease and died within six weeks. Jane Garner, 35, was in good health until a chest infection left her so ill that she had to be admitted to hospital. There, doctors told her she had contracted swine flu which had led to pneumonia. The former dental nurse, from Queniborough, Leicestershire, developed the infection six weeks ago. Yet, despite taking antibiotics and antivirals the illness would not shift. Jane Garden pictured here with her daughter Madison. Mrs Garner was in good health until she contracted swine flu and died within six weeks . She was struggling to breathe on February 21 and her partner Lee Bagnall, rushed her to hospital. When they arrived, he was told that she was seriously ill with pneumonia which had developed from a complication of swine flu. Mrs Garner was put into a medically-induced coma and given a ventilator to help her breathe. After being transferred to specialist . Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, she received extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo) which artificially added oxygen to her blood, giving her lungs a chance . to recover. A week later, the mother of Madison, eight, and Bradley, three, appeared to be getting better and she was brought out of the coma and taken off the Ecmo treatment. But in just a few hours, her condition rapidly deteriorated and doctors called Mr Bagnall and told him that nothing more could be done to save his partner. On March 8, Mrs Gardner died in hospital. Mr Bagnall said that the family were 'stunned' by the outcome because his partner seemed to be 'getting better every day'. He said: 'I think the doctors were as taken aback as me. 'Everything had been so positive. Then I spent the next four hours watching her fade away. 'A few people mentioned that they had had swine flu a few years back but had recovered and been fine. 'On . the Friday, she was a little grumpy because all she wanted was to get . out of bed and we thought she would be home in no time. 'We just never expected this.' Mr Bagnall said that he had been overwhelmed by the support that his family had received. He paid tribute to the care that his partner Jane Garner received at Glenfield Hospital in Leicestershire (pictured) Yet despite the tragedy, Mr Bagnall said that he had been overwhelmed by the support that his family had received. He paid tribute to the care that his partner had received in hospital. He described the events as an 'absolute tragedy' but said that he did not think the hospital could have done any more to save her. He described his partner as having 'lovely hazel eyes' and told of her friendly character. 'We clicked as soon as we met five years ago and we started finishing each others' sentences,' he said. Mr Bagnall said that he believed Mrs Garner had been in a bay specialising in treating swine flu. Patients from across the country were flown in to receive Ecmo treatment at Glenfield because it is one of the few hospitals to offer the treatment, he said. The hospital would not comment on whether any other patients had died. Susan Davey, a senior nurse for infection prevention at Leicester hospitals, said: 'The most common complications of influenza are bronchitis and secondary bacterial pneumonia. 'The young, the elderly, pregnant women and individuals with respiratory or cardiac conditions or reduced immunity are more vulnerable to flu.' The disease was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 and went on to spread across the world. Due to the fact that it was new virus, few people were resistant to the illness. Professor Nick Phinn, a flu expert from Public Health England, said that swine flu was now regarded as one of the seasonal flu strains. Professor Phinn said: 'Over the past five years or so, the percentage of the population with some degree of immunity, either naturally or through vaccination, has been rising. 'However, immunity wanes over time, the virus is constantly changing and evolving and there are other strains of influenza circulating, making flu vaccine the most important step in protecting vulnerable people against flu infection.'","Jane Garner, 35 died within six weeks of contracting virus .

"By . Martin Beckford . It is every Antiques Roadshow fan’s dream – a painting picked up in a shop for just £400 has been identified as a Van Dyck masterpiece. The piece, worth up to £400,000, will be revealed tonight to be the most valuable painting to feature in the show’s 36-year history. It was identified after a hunch by  presenter Fiona Bruce when the owner of the painting, Father Jamie MacLeod, took it along to be valued at Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire. Scroll down for video . Materpiece: Fiona Bruce with FR Jamie MacLeod with the 17th century work of art . Ms Bruce, who recently made a TV programme about Anthony van Dyck, thought it might be a genuine work  by the Flemish master and showed it to an expert. It was later confirmed  to be by the leading court painter in 17th Century England. ‘It’s everyone’s dream to spot a hidden masterpiece,’ she said. ‘I’m thrilled that my hunch paid off – to discover a genuine Van Dyck is incredibly exciting.’ The picture, showing a Brussels magistrate, is believed to be a preparatory piece for a larger work painted in 1634. While the main painting was destroyed in 1695, the smaller single portrait survived and somehow found its way to an antiques shop in Nantwich, Cheshire. From there it was bought for £400 by Fr MacLeod – mainly because he liked its golden frame. Could it be? Antiques Roadshow expert Philip Mould inspects the piece before it was officially verified as a genuine Van Dyck . Stunning: The artwork will now be sold to pay for new bells at Father MacLeod's church . It hung in the hallway of a retreat . he runs for the clergy in Derbyshire. At at one stage, the painting fell . off its hook on the wall and landed on a CD player, smashing the . device. After . art expert Philip Mould inspected it, it underwent a thorough . restoration and was officially verified as a genuine Van Dyck by Dr . Christopher Brown, who is a world authority on the artist. Mr . Mould said: ‘Discoveries of this type are exceptionally rare. The . painting’s emergence from beneath layers of paint was dramatic. ‘It’s . been revealed as a thrilling example of Van Dyck’s skills of direct . observation that made him so great a portrait painter.’ The . artwork will now be sold by Fr MacLeod to pay for the restoration of . bells at the chapel within the grounds of the retreat he runs. Maestro: One of Van Dyck's best known works entitled Mary with child and boy Johannes . He . said: ‘It’s wonderful that new church bells hopefully will be pealing . out to commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War in . 2018.’ The discovery, to be revealed on BBC1 at 7pm tonight, makes the  portrait the most valuable painting ever found on Antiques Roadshow. Among the show’s other most famous previous discoveries is a glass vase bought for £1 at a car boot sale. It  was later identified as a rare Art Nouveau piece and was sold at auction for £32,450. Tonight’s edition of Antiques Roadshow will also reveal that a leather-covered chest inscribed with the initials ‘Q’ and ‘A’ almost certainly belonged to Queen Anne. It has been studied by experts at Hampton Court Palace, who have unearthed records suggesting the chest was used to transport Queen Anne’s bed linen when she travelled between various Royal palaces. Experts on the show estimate it is worth up to £30,000.","Painting taken to be valued at show in Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire .

A Spanish company plans on offering the ultimate day trip to near-space in two years time - just enough time to start saving for the £95,000 ticket. During the flight, passengers will be able to stand up and enjoy fantastic panoramic views of Earth, experience weightlessness and even eat a meal if they desire. Scroll down for video... Would be astronauts looking to book the trip of a lifetime are being offered the chance to float into space in a high tech balloon (pictured) During the flight passengers will be able to stand up in their pod (pictured) and enjoy fantastic panoramic views of Earth, while also being served a meal . The ëblooní is the brainchild of Spanish entrepreneur Jose Mariano Lopez-Urdiales, boss of Barcelona-based Zero2Infinity. Space tourists will journey to earth's outer limits in a capsule that can hold six people - four passenger and two pilots. Annelie Schoenmaker of Zero2Infinity, said: 'The ride will be very gentle and peaceful as well as environmentally friendly. 'Passengers will be able to see the sun and the stars at the same time, while looking down on the curvature of the earth.' The passenger pod is carried into near-space by a high tech balloon and then separates after cruising above the earth for two hours. It is carried back to Earth by a para-foil when passengers will briefly experience zero gravity . Russian adventurer Artemy Lebedev who is one of the few people on the planet to have visited every country, has already signed up for a trip to near-space. Commercial operations will begin in 2015 but a trip will cost around £95,000 per person. Ms Schoenmaker said: 'The experience will be very much like . that in an aeroplane although there will be a period of about 30 seconds . when passengers will experience weightlessness and will be able to . float around the cabin. 'Everything is customised to the person's . individual requirements. We can partition off part of the cabin for . those who want more privacy and we can even serve them Michelin star . meals if that's what they want.' The pod is large enough to carry six passengers - four space tourists and two pilots. The company's 'Bloons' are usually used to conduct science experiments in near space . Zero2Infinitydevelops technologies to enable cost-efficient access to near-space with zero-environmental impact flying solutions. While it currently offers trips for scientific researchers as well as equipment in its 'Bloon' pods, it is targeting couples and families with this new venture. Zero2Infinity's largest pod, which carries six people, has 15 square metres of windows for amazing views of the Earth and space. The company is currently doing test flights and raising more investment for its new venture.

For those lucky enough, or patient enough, to get into Yayoi Kusama's latest exhibition, I Who Have Arrived in Heaven at New York's David Zwirner Gallery, they have just 45 seconds to capture the moment. Only one person at a time is permitted into the exhibition's Infinity Mirrored Room - The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away, lined with colored LED bulbs. But despite the nearly eight-hour-long wait to get into the exhibition, both tourists and eager New Yorker's alike are lining up in order to take just one envy-inducing selfie. Only one person at a time is permitted into Yayoi Kusama's latest exhibition's mirror-lined room, hung with colored LED bulbs, called Infinity Mirrored Room - The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away . Currently, there are 2,586 hashtags for #DavidZwirner on Instagram, 1,045 for #DavidZwirnerGallery, and 1,354 for #IHaveArrivedinHeaven. The average wait to get into the gallery can run anywhere from four hours on a weekday, and double that on a weekend. And with the exhibition's last day, December 21, fast approaching, the line is set to get even longer. 'The line is definitely getting longer,' David Zwirner Gallery's manager Anita Ragusa told MailOnline, adding that it is several hours long before they even open the doors. She advises that people 'bundle up and arrive as early as possible' to catch the exhibition before it closes at midday on Saturday. 'The earliest that someone has lined up is 7.30am,' she added. Encompassing a cube-shaped, mirror-paneled room that features a shallow reflecting pool as its floor, The Infinity Mirrored Room features hundreds of multicolored LED lights are suspended at varying heights from the ceiling.

The exhibition's second most photographed mirrored room, Love Is Calling, also known as 'the tentacle room,' where phallic forms  resemble large polka-dot sea urchins, is also a main draw. But the show also features 27 new large-scale paintings alongside a recent video installation by the 84-year-old Japanese artist, which span the gallery's two adjacent locations on 19th street in Chelsea. Here there is no line. Kusama’s work has transcended two of the most important art movements of the second half of the twentieth century: pop art and minimalism. Her career spans paintings, performances, room-size presentations, outdoor sculptural installations, literary works, films, fashion, design, and interventions within existing architectural structures. The exhibition’s title, I Who Have Arrived In Heaven, aims to reflect the artist’s long-standing interest in cosmic realms, while at the same time presenting a link to her artistic production from the past six decades.","Yayoi Kusama's latest exhibition, I Who Have Arrived in Heaven, is showing until December 21 at the David Zwirner Gallery ."
"By . Tom Gardner . Professional origami artist Sipho Mabona is hoping to push - or should that be fold - the envelope of his art form by creating a life-size elephant from a single piece of paper measuring 15 metres square. The extraordinary work of art requires four people working for two weeks to turn the two dimensional sheet into a three metre tall structure. Over more than a month, Swiss-based Mr Mabona, 33, has painstakingly planned the intricate pattern, which details where exactly and in what order, to fold the paper. Scroll down for video . Grand ambition: Origami artist Sipho Mabona is planning on folding a life-size elephant from a single sheet of paper . Scale: Sipho Mabona hopes to turn a 15metre by 15metre sheet of paper into a three metre tall elephant . Once completed it will be supported by an aluminium frame and covered in a clear lacquer to add to its rigidity. Mr Mabona then plans to erect the . elephant in the Art Museum in Beromünster, Switzerland, while being . filmed by several cameras for a watching public. But he now needs to secure the money to pay to turn his dream into a reality. Plans: Sipho Mabona has spent more than a month working out the intricate pattern of folds required to turn the art from two to three dimensions . Intricate: Each fold in the paper will have to be in the perfect position . Crease: The Lucerne-based Sipho Mabona needs to raise $24,000 to make his life-size elephant project a reality . He is attempting to crowdsource the $24,000 required to launch the project. So far, donors have pledged nearly $17,000 - $7,000 short of his total - with just 17 days left. Mr Mabona said: 'As an ultimate proof that there are no limits to what can be made out of a uncut square piece of paper, I plan to fold a life-size replica of an elephant. 'Over the course of several weeks the monumental sculpture will be folded at the Art Museum in Beromünster, Switzerland. A team of three assistants will support me on this mission. Practise: This small model shows how origami artist Sipho Mabona would go about making his three metre tall elephant . Heavy lifting: Sipho Mabona will need three assistants to manipulate the huge sheet of paper . Support: Donors have pledged nearly $17,000 - $7,000 short of his total . Origami in action: The tiny elephant, on which Swiss artist Sipho Mabona will base the life-size version, begins to take shape . 'Using a sheet measuring 15 by 15 meters, we will create an elephant standing more than 3 meters tall. 'Further more we will install two cameras which will be feeding footage to an online live video stream, so you, your friends and family can watch us as we fold.' He added: 'I believe that Origami and the White Elephant are so fascinating due to the prevalent belief that the use of only one piece of paper is very limiting. Drama: Origami artist Sipho Mabona wants to turn the creation of a life-size elephant into a piece of performance art . 2D to 3D: Artist Sipho Mabona will film his origami evolving from a flat sheet of paper into an elephant . Taking shape: The unmistakable elephant shape is created from dozens of creases . 'But actually the very contrary is the . case. In the art form of origami a simple piece of paper can be . transformed into anything imaginable. 'It’s . exactly this transformation, which in my opinion stands for many . struggles we have to overcome in life. This project will be a great . experience for us to share with you.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . An iPhone case has been developed with a built-in breathalyser. Users breathe into a test hole in the case and readings pop up on a display seconds later. Hiroyasu Yamamitsu, boss of Japanese firm Thanko which created the device, said: ‘After drinking  alcohol it’s difficult to know whether people can drive a car or not. ‘People need to check if they’re safe to drive and there’s nothing more convenient than having one built in to your phone’s case.’ However, the case should not be used as a standalone device to determine a safe driving limit, the firm warned. To get a blood alcohol reading from the Japanese Alcohol Checker case, pictured, users blow onto the test hole on the back of the case for up to five seconds. After 20 seconds, the reading, measured in grams per litre appears on a small display, shown as a percentage . The display will also light up red, pictured left, or green, pictured right, to warn people if they're over the driving limit, or it is safe to get in the car.

The UK drink driving limit is 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The device works once users have blown into the case for three to five seconds. After 20 seconds the reading is  displayed as a percentage on the back of the case. The display also lights up red, yellow or green to warn people if they’re over the safe driving limit. If the screen glows red, it means it is not safe to drive, while a green screen means driving will be within the legal limit. When . the screen glows yellow, users are bordering on being over the limit . and should stop drinking and wait a while before checking the reading . again, Thanko explained. To enable the breathalyser, the user can click the Check Alcohol button on the app. The Alcohol Checker case also charges a phone using a built-in 1,800 mAh battery. The case works in the same way as a docking station and users can switch between using the phone's battery, to using the power in the case.

Shanghai score: This mini golf course is inside of a home in St.Andrew's Manor in Shanghai, China . His website says that the homes in Bankok reminded him of the 'cookie-cutter houses that resembled structures in his home country of Sweden.' He told Slate he was allowed to go back to the suburb called Parkway Chatlet that he spotted on the plane . 'In spite of the gates, I was allowed access without any question,' he said. The project's website states, 'Suburbia Gone Wild provides a fascinating window into one of the greatest structural changes of the 21st-century, the rise of the upper middle class in the developing world. Exploring the search for identity among this new strata of society, Adolfsson takes us where they live: the shiny, newly-developed suburbs surrounding the new economic centers of the world.'In 2008, Adolfsson received three grants  for his project but was faced with the dilemma of gaining access to the suburban homes. After sending numerous letters asking for permission to photograph, he received some disheartening responses.

One day in Bangkok: This is a photo of a home in Parkway Chatlet in Bangkok, Thailand . 'Responses ranged everywhere from no answer at all to ""Thank you for your request, we are reviewing it but we want final approval and full supervision,"" and I realized that those restrictions would set the project in an entirely different and limited direction,' he told Slate. He decided to visit the homes, not as a photographer, but as an interested buyer. He went as far as to hire local residents to pretend to be his spouse or colleague. He would let his assistants so all the talking while he only had several minutes to shoot a few photos. 'Because the images were captured in this semi-clandestine way, there wasn’t much time reflect as I was working; at most locations, I only had five or 10 minutes to shoot,' he told Slate. His website says of the project, 'His approach is best described as a combination of positively amusing and awkwardly eerie, as he documents a curious phenomenon that looks more and more like the constructed world of The Truman Show.' All Adolfsson's photographs were taken with a SLR camera without professional lighting. Adolfsson attributes the quality of the photos to the fact that the homes have a sense of familiarity and are 'made to be easily captured.' 'There is a lot of uncertainty as the global economy expands and cultural borders continue to dissolve. People seek out common experience and comfort, and perhaps these model homes reflect pop culture as a uniting common denominator,' Adolfsson told Slate. The artist also has an upcoming project called 'Geographic Proximity' which explores the relationship between the ever changing landscape and the society we live in.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . A Navy veteran with just a handful of relatives has been given a packed funeral after a plea from staff at his care home. Staff at  Woodland Court residential care home in Portchester, Portsmouth, put out the appeal on Facebook for people to go to mourn Rodney 'Vic' Silvester and scores of people turned up. They even found a bugler to sound the Last Post for Mr Silvester who lost his battle with cancer. John Harper, his second cousin, said the veteran would have been 'chuffed to bits' with the turnout in Hampshire. Rodney 'Vic' Silvester (pictured in his naval uniform), who died at the age of 67, had just a handful of living relatives . Turn-out: Scores of mourners turned out to pay their respects at Mr Silvester's funeral service after he lost his battle with cancer, despite never having met the veteran . Proud: Veterans packed into the funeral service for the former sailor after his care home put out a plea on Facebook . Care home staff contacted the Supporting Veterans in Care Facebook page amid fears just a handful of people would attend. The British Legion and the Submariners' Association helped to spread the word, and on the day of the service Mr Silvester's coffin was followed by a steady stream of mourners as it was carried towards Fareham Cemetery. His coffin was draped in a Union Flag and the bugler played as he was laid to rest. Throughout his time in the Navy, Mr Silvester worked at HMS Dolphin and on submarines HMS Odin and HMS Dreadnought. Mr Harper, from Bognor Regis, West Sussex, who attended with Rodney's first cousin Allan Cox, said: 'I think it is fabulous, absolutely superb. 'I didn’t expect such a large turn out, it’s brilliant. I would like to say thank you very much for everybody for turning out. 'Rod would have been chuffed to bits and so would his dad. He would have loved every bit of it.' Mr Cox explained that Mr Silvester had four other cousins living around the country who would have attended the service had they had enough notice. Fitting farewell: The British Legion and the Submariners' Association spread the word about the veteran's funeral service . Little was known about Mr Silvester before his death, as he had become withdrawn after his friends and some of his family passed away. He served in Australia and in the Antarctic. Roy . Dixon, from Gosport, Hampshire, who is a member of the Submariners’ Association, said he was proud to attend and pay his respects. Mr Dixon said: 'We heard that Vic had passed and the information was very scant.' The care home had struggled to contact some of the remaining members of the former sailor's family. 'So . we decided that we would not let the side down, and do what we would . always do and attend the funeral of a fellow submariner,' Mr Dixon said. 'I’m so pleased that the turn out is as good as this. There . are people from all walks of Navy life, surface ships, bombers, diesel . boats, there’s even a green beret here which is really something.' Solemn occasion: Mr Silvester's second cousin John Harper described the response from the community as 'fabulous' Send-off: Representatives from 'all walks of Navy life' attended the service at Fareham Cemetery in Hampshire . Staff from Mr Silvester’s care home, Woodland Court residential care home in Portchester, were also at his funeral. One employee, Tamie Pye, said: 'He came out of his shell once he came to us. He was like a new man.' Another, Lisa Smith, added: 'Vic kept himself to himself but he did like to have a good chat, especially about his navy days.' Father Paul Miles-Knight, who led the service, said: 'It is amazing to see so many people here. 'At the start there was only going to be me and three others here but thanks to the wonders of the internet, the veterans got together. 'Mr Silvester would have been proud.'

"By . Martin Robinson . British children as young as seven are taking ecstasy and cannabis, it was revealed today. Nine-year-olds are also trying cocaine and often it is because their parents are failing to control them, experts say. The Government's annual crime survey has shown for the first time the youngest users of the most popular drugs in Britain - cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine. Fears: Children as young as seven are trying cannabis (posed by models) and other drugs like ecstasy . They found almost one in three who have ever smoked cannabis first tried it when they were under 16. Around six per cent of those who had ever taken Class A cocaine took it first at school and 8.2 per cent had taken ecstasy before they turned 16. Jeremy Todd, chief executive of the charity Family Lives, said: 'We speak to thousands of families every year and evidence shows that parents are the main influence on how children approach drugs and alcohol. 'Equipping parents with the tools to ensure they can talk effectively with their children is the best way of preventing children experimenting at an early age and can prevent later problems in teenage and adult life.' Common: Children across the UK are taking ecstasy, pictured, a Home Office survey has shown . The results give a shocking picture of drug use by children in Britain. 'The most commonly reported age for first taking cannabis was 16 years. But, as expected, there was a lot of variation among adults in the age cannabis was reported to be first taken, ranging from eight to 56 years old,' the report says. 'Age of onset was most commonly 18 for cocaine powder, but again this was within a wide range of reported ages, from nine to 57 years old. 'The most commonly reported age of onset for ecstasy was 18 years. Again, the first age of use reported by adults varied considerably, between seven and 51 years old.' But it appears that drugs are getting less attractive to young people, because abuse is 'around the lowest level since measurement began in 1996. The report says adults between 16 and 59, 8.9 per cent had taken drugs in the last 12 months, which is a drop. Cannabis use has dropped the most, while there have been reductions in ecstasy and cocaine compared with the 1990s. High school children taking drugs is down 12 per cent and the number of under-16s trying cigarettes is at its lowest for 30 years.","Home office survey also reveals nine-year-olds are taking cocaine .

Footage meanwhile taken from inside the bus captured the moment the victim was kicked in the midriff before he fell out of the window. The man's sister, identified as Gillian, told the programme: 'At the moment they can't pinpoint a time on his recovery due to the fact that his back was so badly broken and his spinal chord was damaged. He needs to recover from his broken back before we even know if he's able to walk again. 'He's paralysed basically - he can't feel his legs, which is a life-changing experience. It's obviously going to be a bit hard for him.' Detective Constable Tony Barun, a specialist safer transport command officer for the Met, told the programme: 'It's still shocking. Although we see violence every day, it's our bread and butter, it's still shocking to see something as graphic and violent as this. 'We know these windows can be kicked out with a great deal of effort, but to see someone kicked so hard that he actually goes through the window and it pops the window out of its frame - I've never seen that before.' Police have said the man was left paralysed from the waist down following the incident in December 2012 .

"By . James  Nye . Heartbreaking: Michael Russell was stabbed to death in the backyard of his home suffering more than 12 wounds - Jae Williams and Randy Thompson are facing murder charges for the 2009 crime . The anguished wails of an uncle desperately trying to save his nephew who had been viciously stabbed were played to stunned silence in a San Jose court on Tuesday. So distressing were the pleas of Thomas Russell for his 15-year-old nephew Michael Russell to 'come back, please come back to me' heard on the 911 call - that jurors broke down in tears. The short tape was played by the prosecution on the first day of the murder trial of Jae Williams, who is accused along with another man of being a Satanist who befriended Russell in November 2009 just to kill him for the 'sheer thrill of it.' Both Williams and Randy Thompson, who are now 20, are accused of stabbing Michael to death in his own San Jose backyard with a kitchen knife belonging to Thompson's mother. The pair are being tried separately as adults after Williams told police in the aftermath of the killing that he worshiped the Devil and had already beaten a cat to death. Williams also told police that Thompson was very keen to make his 'first human kill' and the alleged killers were so close that they had exchanged rings and given each other morbid nicknames - 'Grimm' and 'Goure'. 'I guess I just finally wanted to kill somebody,' Williams told detectives two days after the November 2009 murder according to a transcript of the interview. 'I had my chance and I took it.' The shocking murder occurred at Michael Russell's home while his mother had left to shop at Target in the early evening. Williams and Thompson came round to smoke marijuana, having already selected that day to kill their fellow teen. The court heard how the two teenagers tackled him and pinned him down while they began to calmly stab him. Harrowingly, Russell, who believed the boys were his friends, initially thought they were joking according to the alleged confession Williams gave to the police. 'He was on the floor and he was yelling a little bit,' Williams said according to Mercury News, 'like telling us ... 'Come on, guys.' Williams allegedly told police the attack continued for six minutes and culminated in them slitting the teens throat. Charges: Jae Williams (pictured here in 2009 - aged 15) is on trial for the murder of Michael Russell in November 2009 . Williams listened while the 911 tape was played to the court who heard Thomas Russell plead with his nephew to stay with him on speaker phone, while the sound of him compressing Michael's chest was audible. 'He's been stabbed, oh my God, please, somebody help me,' Thomas Russell cried as the 911 operator tried to calm him to get an accurate address. 'Come on, son ... no ... no ... Michael, come back.' Michael was stabbed more than 12 times, one wound punctured his larynx, jugular vein and cartoid artery, while another caused his right lung to collapse. The sheer force of the attack meant another of his wounds was a seven-inch deep stab wound to into his heart and his hands were cut as he tried to defend himself. 'Jae Williams and another boy -- cloaked in friendship -- went to Michael Russell's house and unleashed a ferocious attack,' said prosecutor Valerie McGuire. Sickening: Randy Thompson (pictured almost 5 years ago) is accused of stabbing Michael Russell with his friend Jae Williams in an attack which lasted six minutes in November 2009 . McGuire told the court that DNA evidence and the alleged confession from Williams after police were tipped-off he was involved will provide enough evidence to convict. 'He is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt,' she said according to Mercury News. In another tragic detail, Santa Clara County pathologist Dr. Joseph O'Hara testified to the court that Michael didn't bleed much because his wounds were so devastating his heart was unable to pump anymore. Williams, who was 15 at the time of the November 10 attack, allaegedly bragged to police in a confession of sorts after his arrest. He said that they took a knife from Thompson's house and after the killing wrapped it in discarded clothing and hid it between two cars in his driveway. The prosecution allege the recovered knife is smeared with Michael Russell's blood. Authorities also recovered Williams and Thompson's sweatshirts from bushes nearby to the knife - which also have the murdered teens DNA on them.","First day of murder for Jae Williams, 20, who is accused of viciously stabbing Michael Russell, in 2009 when they were both 15 .

One of the males then punched her in the face, which knocked her to the ground and unconscious,' according to a news release from the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office. When she awoke, one of the men kicked her torso. The men then fled.

There’s no reason for us not to believe her, and we’ll proceed with the investigation. Everything we see matches what she said.' Fox added that the men, who have nto been found, would face assault charges. If the subjects are identified and a case built, hate crimes charges could be added. The sheriff’s office described one of the suspects as a white male in his mid-20s, standing 5-foot-10 to 5-foot-11 and heavyset with a husky voice.

"By . Jill Reilly . Jordan Belfort is reportedly renting a $4 million beachfront mansion in California, despite owing nearly $100 million to his defrauded investor . Jordan Belfort's creditors have chased him down to a luxury $4 million California mansion that he is reportedly renting, despite owing nearly $100 million to defrauded investors. Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese’s hit film Wolf of Wall Street, is being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s. LR Credit previously obtained a judgment against Belfort in New York for $27,597 from unpaid retail purchases Belfort made during his hedonistic days, reports TMZ. But Belfort, 50, fled to glitzy Manhattan Beach, where he reportedly rents a glamorous mansion, temporarily escaping LR Credit's judgment against him. But now the collection agency has filed new legal documents to make their NY judgment enforceable in California. The . former stockbroker was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to . his victims as part of his sentencing in 2003, but so far, he has paid . just $11.6 million - and most of that came from sales of his property. Belfort set up the brokerage house Stratton Oakmont alongside Danny Porush. The 'boiler room' firm . based on Long Island designed to 'pump and dump' shares by hyping their . prospects and quickly cashing in once their price rose. The . pair managed to rake in $200million from the fraud, which they spent on . cocaine, prostitutes and a yacht once owned by Coco Chanel. However, after the FBI caught up with them in 1996, Belfort spent 22 months in prison while Porush was sentenced to 39 months. Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, in which he is played by Leonard Dicaprio, is now being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s . Belfort has written a pair of . memoirs detailing his past misdeeds, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2008 and . 2009's Catching the Wolf of Wall Street. Red Granite Productions paid Belfort, 51, $1.045 million for the rights to his story in 2011. But according to government documents, Belfort paid just $21,000 in restitution that year. According to Belfort himself, he hasn't profited from his story. 'I . am not making any royalties off the film or the books, and I am totally . content with that. My income comes from new life, which is far better . than my old one,' Belfort wrote on his Facebook page on December 29. 'For . the record, I am not turning over 50% of the profits of the books and . the movie, which was what the government had wanted me to do. Instead, I . insisted on turning over 100% of the profits of both books and the . movie, which is to say, I am not making a single dime on any of this. This should amount to countless millions of dollars and hopefully be . more than enough to pay back anyone who is still out there,' he added. New career: The former stockbroker owes victims $110 million and should be paying 50 per cent of his income as a public speaker in restitution . Prosecutors say Belfort . is living off book royalties, the money from the film rights and fees . from his burgeoning career as a motivational speaker. In . addition, say prosecutors, Belfort has skipped the country to . Australia, complicating the government's efforts to track his income. 'We . want to set the record straight,' Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the . U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn told the Wall Street Journal. 'Belfort's making these claims, and they're not factual. He's in Australia and using that loophole to avoid paying.' 'The . government has seen nothing to suggest that even 100 per cent of . Belfort's profits from his book and the movie Wolf of Wall Street would . yield, in his words, ""countless millions,"" much less the approximately . $100 million that is still owed to the victims,' he said. Belfort's . lawyer denies that charge, saying his client traveled to Australia for . work reasons but lives in Manhattan Beach, California. Dispute: Prosecutors say Belfort and his partner have relocated to Australia to avoid paying back what he owes, but his lawyer says the pair are based in California . Belfort's Facebook page . tells a different story: photographs appear on his page dated from . April 10 2013 through May and June. He then appears to head to London . and Los Angeles before arriving back in Australia in November, where . he's apparently spent most of his time up until now. His most recent posts all come from Melbourne, Australia. The U.S. government contends that . Belfort must continue to pay 50 per cent of his income in restitution, . but Belfort's lawyer says he is no longer obligated to comply with . the court-ordered payment plan because his supervised release period is . now over. Belfort's lawyer, Nicholas De Feis, told the Wall Street Journal that his client has paid every restitution payment he owes. 'He's made payments as . he was required to make payments and as he earned income,' said De Feis. 'He has never run from his obligations.'","Jordan Belfort is inspiration behind Martin Scorsese’s Wolf of Wall Street .

After spending two days sleeping in bushes while wearing only a light jacket and running shorts in the sub-zero conditions, Mr Root said the only thing he could think about eating was an In-N-Out burger.

The group was training for the annual Western States Endurance run in June . When his group briefly . stopped, Root decided to run ahead and catch the faster team, but he . took a wrong turn on the trail and disappeared from sight into the mountain range. An extensive search began on the rugged terrain within hours, but it was suspended due to darkness and falling temperatures. Root . ended up on a cliff overlooking the American River, where he slept intermittently in shrubbery on Sunday evening - keeping his fingers warm by putting them under his armpits. He also compressed and released . his muscles over and over to stay warm. The search restarted on Monday morning, with more than 60 people taking to the mountain range using motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, search dogs and helicopters to no avail.

Root, meanwhile, found himself wandering around in circles, somehow always ending up on the same cliff top and gradually running out of the energy supplements and water he had been carrying. Determined not to spend another night on the same cliff, Root took another root and eventually reached the El Dorado Bridge, where he saw people . wearing bright-colored uniforms.

"By . Associated Press . Chrysler is recalling nearly 870,000 SUVs because corrosion may make the vehicles' brakes harder to use. Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs from the 2011 through 2014 model years are involved. Chrysler says crimp joints in the brake boosters can corrode if they're exposed to water. Recall: Chrysler Group said on Wednesday it would recall nearly 870,000 vehicles to fix a defect in the brake systems following complaints about excessive brake-pedal firmness . Defect: Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said the recalled vehicles will be installed with a shield to protect brake boosters from corrosion caused by water exposure . If the water freezes, the boosters won't aid braking as they usually do. Chrysler began investigating after some customers said their brakes felt too firm when pressed down. The company knows of one accident, but no injuries, due to the defect. Dealers will install a shield to protect the boosters for free and replace boosters that aren't working properly. Chrysler has since changed the design to make the boosters more corrosion resistant. Chrysler will notify owners of the recall, which involves 867,795 vehicles. Replacement: The company said in a statement Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs, model years 2011-2014, were under inspection and brake boosters would be replaced wherever necessary . When Chrysler first became aware of a problem last spring, it concluded vehicles would still meet federal standards and began adding a coating to new parts. But cold weather set in, and owners contacted the safety agency after water that had entered the brake booster froze, affecting braking performance. New models, increasingly complex technology and heightened regulatory scrutiny have led to more auto recalls. Chrysler told the safety agency that it had noted more warranty claims than expected in May, and by July, it had figured out the corrosion problem. At the time, it concluded a recall was not necessary because while drivers would need to push the pedal harder, there was no loss of braking. The automaker said it was justified in handling the matter as a â€œquality initiativeâ€ .","Chrysler recalls 868,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs vehicles .

Fox News reports that Morrow calmly helped her aunt get an ambulance for her father despite her own turbulent emotions. 'I did freeze, my hands froze over the keyboard, but I knew I had to get the call in,' says Morrow. Morrow's aunt, Gail Morrow, was in so much shock she didn't even know it was her niece on the other line reports ABC. Morrow said that the only way she was able to stay calm was through her fantastic training as a 911 phone dispatcher. 'Because of so many people being in the room, I didn’t think that I would get the call and it’s crazy that I got it on the very first day,' said the operator to Yahoo News. Ms. Morrow's colleague Danielle Harvey told yahoo that trainees are taught how to take calls from their family members on their first day of the job. 'She handled it well. She took the entire call. She got up after it was over and went out. So I checked on her and told her to go see about her family,' Harvey told the station. Morrow says she has Harvey to thank for her successful operator call. 'She’s very detailed and she wouldn’t let me sink. So, I am very thankful,' Morrow said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Starbucks is learning that people really like their sliced cake loaves. The Seattle-based coffee company says it will start bringing back its cake slices in response to customer feedback. The company had been getting rid of the slices that came in banana, iced lemon and pumpkin flavors as part of a staggered rollout of its pricier new baked goods. In their place, Starbucks offered what looked like miniature loaves that cost $2.45, an increase of 20 cents. Not so great: Some regulars of the coffee chain complained after many stores got rid of the sliced cake loaves in favor of upscale La Boulange pastries, but a spokeswoman for Starbucks said the treats will be reintroduced in coming weeks . Bring it back: The Seattle-based company had previously rid their stores of the pumpkin, iced lemon and banana loaves for pricier pastries under the La Boulange label . Lisa Passe, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said the company realized that 'people really like the familiar, sliced cake.' She noted that the cake slices will still be made with new recipes and carry the higher prices. Without providing details, she said the slices will return 'in coming weeks.' The new baked goods, which are warmed up in the Starbucks ovens, have so far been rolled out to roughly half of the company's 11,500 U.S. locations. That means about half of stores never got rid of the cake slices. Going stale: Starbucks has made significant effort to improve upon its criticized line of less-than-stellar baked goods in the last few years, in part by buying up La Boulange, a San Francisco-based bakery, in 2012 . Strategy: Getting the menu right is critical to StarbucksÂ¿ U.S. growth strategy. In a saturated coffee market, the company is trying to entice more customers to add a pastry or croissant to their latte orders . Starbucks Corp., which has long been criticized for its underwhelming baked goods, has been trying to boost sales by convincing more people to get a bite to eat with their drinks. In 2012, the company bought a small bakery chain called La Boulange that it said would start producing its baked goods with better ingredients. Among the new items that have been hitting some stores are savory croissant squares and the sweet loaves that look like rectangular cakes, instead of the slices previously offered. One reason the new shape of the cake loaves isn't going over well may that they don't look as big. 'The look a lot smaller, and they're priced higher,' said Zee Lemke, a barista at a Starbucks cafe in Madison, Wisconsin, who said the new baked goods are doing 'terribly' relative to the previous baked goods. Lemke noted that the biggest sellers tend to be breakfast sandwiches or other foods that make people feel full, rather than the smaller 'status consumption foods' Starbucks seems to be pushing. Not just coffee: Selling more food is part of a strategy to expand beyond coffee into everything from tea to alcohol. Starbucks is adding beer and wine, along with appetizers, to thousands of locations in the U.S. She said some of the new offerings, like the croissant squares, came across as 'too fancy.' Another item that customers seem to miss is the reduced fat cinnamon swirl coffee cake, Lemke said, noting that the company didn't introduce a replacement for the offering in the revamp. 'When we launched (the new baked goods), they held a big meeting and told us how awesome it was going to be. We ended up having to throw away tons of it,' she said. Starbucks maintains that the new baked goods are being well-received overall. In January, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead said that croissant sales had doubled in stores where the new recipes were introduced. But it's not clear if the spike was the result of people giving new items a try. But Alstead also conceded that the rollout is 'complex,' particularly since the new baked goods have to be warmed up. The danger is that the extra step could slow down operations, which in turn could drive away impatient customers, particularly during the busy mornings.","Starbucks bought gourmet-baking company La Boulange in 2012 .

The discovery has shocked neighbors who didnâ€™t think anything was wrong because the grass was regularly cut and the mailbox wasn't overflowing. The twins were known to live a hermit lifestyle and did not communicate regularly either with family or anyone else, reports WRCB. A sister of the twins had tried to check on them in August 2011, but didn't have a key. She had called police and they found that the residence appeared to be vacant. A letter from the Post Office was found in the mailbox stating that they believed the residence to be vacant and to cease delivery of mail to the address. On Saturday family members called police after finding a key to the residence and officers found deceased inside . Officers also discovered in 2011 that there were no signs of forced entry to the residence, no foul odors, no signs of foul play or suspicious activity, and no visible/evident reason to allow forced entry to the residence. At that time, family members indicated that they would not have been surprised if the brothers had moved without telling anyone.

They have had to remove Ruby from the shop floor for fears her profane language could offend more customers or be picked up by children. Who's a pretty ****ing boy then? An African Grey has been thrown out of the Norcutts Garden Centre in Ashton, Greater Manchester, for a string of foul-mouthed rants. Staff are hoping to re-educate her (file photo) Notice: This sign was put on Ruby's cage after she offended customers with what staff called 'naughty words' All is not lost, however - as they are hoping to re-educate Ruby with a more polite vocabulary and return her to public display so she can find a loving home. A spokesman for Norcutts said: 'We decided to remove her from the centre after receiving a number of complaints about her repeating rude words, and her content was getting much worse. 'We've no idea where she's learned it from, but we felt it would be best to take her off the shop floor. 'It's a very funny incident, but hopefully Ruby can soon return.' The first customers knew of Ruby's punishment was when a sign appeared on her cage announcing what had happened. Re-education: The parrot will be retrained with a more polite vocabulary and return to the shop floor . It said: 'Ruby our African Grey parrot has picked up some naughty words and has decided to say them repeatedly. 'We can only offer our apologies if this causes offence.' It added: 'Please do not put fingers or objects through the bars of Ruby's cage as she may bite.' The message was picked up by the local MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, Labour's Jonathan Reynolds, who spotted it on a family day out on Sunday and posted it on Twitter. 'We'd been out for a Mother's Day meal and decided to take the kids over to the garden centre to look at the animals,' he said. 'Ruby was still there at this point but thankfully she was on her best behaviour and we didn't hear a single swear word from her.' A spokesman for Norcutts, which runs the centre, said: 'We've no idea where she's learned it from' African Greys have been dubbed the Einsteins of the parrot world for their intelligence. A 2012 study found the birds were capable of thinking at the same intellectual level as a young human child. Scientists at the University of Vienna in Austria put the parrots in front of two opaque boxes, one of which contained a piece of walnut which rattled when shaken. More times than could simply be put down to chance, the parrots chose the rattling box - correctly deducing that there must be food inside. Over time, when presented with the two boxes, they could even guess that the food was in the second box straight away when the first made no noise.","Several customers complained about parrot in Ashton, Greater Manchester .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . An elderly widow who had fallen behind in her property taxes discovered she longer owned her home after trying to sell it to pay off her debt. Unbeknown to Hertha Handler, ownership of her $1.2 million Oyster Bay Cove home in Long Island has been transferred to an investor who bought two of the liens against the property. The 73-year-old widow had lived in the property for more than 40 years but after her husband died several years ago, she slipped behind on taxes and had an outstanding debt of $200,000. Shocked: Hertha Handler knew she was behind on taxes but had no idea she no longer owned her house . Multiple liens had been made against the property, where Mrs Handler had raised her two sons, but she had no idea ownership had been transferred to investor Albert Kalimian. By buying just two of the liens from . Oyster Bay Cove village for about $3,000 each, Mr Kalimian was able to . take possession of the property. Obtaining a property through liens differs from state to state, but in most cases an investor bids on liens and then waits to see if the owner will pay off the debt. Tax collectors wait for a set amount of time, governed by each state, before putting the unpaid property taxes up for auction. The winning bidder then has two ways to make money from their purchase. If the property owner pays the taxes in the given time, the investor gets their money back, plus interest. If the debt remains unpaid the investor can file a lawsuit seeking ownership of the property. 'For him to be able to come in and take . the house that my parents had paid off and lived for 40 years for a few . thousand dollars, that shouldn't happen,' Mrs Handlerâ€™s son, . Christopher, told NBC New York. An attorney for the family agreed, and said more effort should have been made to alert Mrs Handler to the legal issues she was facing. 'There should have been a further effort . to make sure that Hertha Handler was being advised that she was in . serious jeopardy of losing title to her house,' Elias . Schwartz said. The widow said although she knew she falling behind on her taxes, she didn't confide in her family because she didn't want to trouble them. 'I have a difficult time asking for help,' she said. Attorneys . for Mrs Handler and Mr Kalimian are now trying to work out a deal, to . ensure the widow can retain ownership of her family home. Memories: Hertha Handler raised her two sons in this Oyster Bay Cove home, where she has lived for 40 years . Deal: Ownership of the house was transferred to investor Albert Kalimian when he bought two of the liens . Mr Kalimian had acted legally when he bought the liens, and the village attorney approved the property transfer, his attorney Alan Davis told NBC New York. He added that when his client took on the property he didn't know the woman who lived there was an elderly widow. An expert in property law said cases such as Mrs Handler's are relatively common, and that there are few restrictions on selling on liens. 'I would imagine 30 to 40 percent of the . municipalities make it easy to collect on tax liens because they want . to sell the liens, they don't want to hold them. It takes a long time . and manpower they don't have,' Ed Klein, a lawyer who has worked on similar cases, said. The Oyster Bay Cove mayor and the attorney who approved the property transfer have not yet commented.","Hertha Handler had $200,000 property tax arrears on her Oyster Bay Cove home .

James Handley, 47, of South Ogden, Utah was staying with his fiancee at Dorothea Beach on St Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands when he went for a  swim off Coki Point on Saturday. Handley and a male friend planned to swim to Thatch Cay, a small island 2,000 feet off the coast of St Thomas, Coast Guard officials said.

"By . Sara Malm . Utah has become the latest of an increasing number of U.S. states to bring in legislation against revenge porn. Legal experts called the new legislation an 'important step', but noted that the law only protects against revenge porn published with intent to cause harm, leaving a loophole for third-party sites spreading the images. Revenge porn is defined as sexually explicit images, initially shared with a partner, appearing online as ‘payback’, often after a relationship has ended. Scroll down for video . Naked regrets: As chat-apps such as Whatsapp and Snapchat have grown in popularity, so has 'sexting' - sending explicit photographs to partners (posed by models) Already outlawed in some form in Alaska, Idaho, Texas, California and New Jersey, several states including Maryland and Wisconsin are considering making the practice illegal. The Substitute Distribution of Intimate Images was signed into Utah state law on Monday by Governor Gary Herbert. It outlaws the publication of intimate images with intent to cause emotional stress or harm. This means that the law covers person-on-person revenge, but does not make it illegal to run revenge porn websites where images are often tied to the person’s name, address and phone number. To add insult to injury, it is not unheard of for revenge porn sites to offer 'reputation protection services' where they take the photographs or video down in return for money – essentially blackmail. Loophole: Although the new Utah law protects against sharing intimate pictures published with the intention to cause harm, it does not protect against 'revenge porn websites' As a result, Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who is helping states draft revenge porn laws, said she was extremely disappointed with the law. ‘The harm [those webmasters] in fact cause victims is no less serious than the vengeful ex-partner,’ Professor Franks told Daily Dot. ‘This requirement gives people a free pass to ruin lives using sexually explicit images so long as they can plausibly argue they had some other motive other than harassment or causing distress.’ In an interview last year, Professor Franks explained further that sharing a nude picture with another person implies limited consent similar to other business transactions. 'If you give your credit card to a waiter, you aren't giving him permission to buy a yacht,' Prof. Franks said. In California, where spurned lovers who post graphic images of an ex face prison sentence while those convicted of malicious intent could also be fined $1,000, a website owner has just been arrested after extorting thousands of dollars from his victims. Fighting back: Several U.S. states now have some form of legislation against revenge porn, as well as countries like Australia and Israel . Kevin Bollaert has been charged with 31 offences pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in to a revenge porn website he ran. And while it may be easy to dismiss revenge porn as a side-line issue, research from the University of Indiana recently showed that more than half (52.3 per cent) of young adults have engaged in 'unwanted but consensual sexting with a committed partner.' The precise scope of the problem is unclear because many victims never come forward or are frequently turned away by the police. Suing for civil damages is another option, but that, too, means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner. The revenge porn-phenomenon is as border-less as the internet, and several countries have now introduced legislation against it. In January this year, Australia and Israel passed against revenge porn, with . Knesset member Yifat Kariv, who introduced the law, called the phenomenon 'virtual rape'.","Utah bans publishing intimate images with intention of causing distress .

Their son and dog were turned over to other family members. The couple claimed to be wealthy . Scottish aristocrats while living in the community of Deephaven, Minnesota, where authorities pledged last week to do everything in their power to bring them to justice. 'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida .

'These were rich folks ripping off the . system,' Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a press . conference on Friday. 'I will make sure they do hard time.' While probation is the lightest sentence allowable for the charges of welfare fraud, Freeman vowed to push for prison time, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. 'I can’t imagine a judge in this district allowing the Lord and Lady to get probation,' Freeman quipped. The maximum sentence is a $100,000 fine and 20 years behind bars. Along with the . million-dollar yacht called the Andrea Aras, the couple have a grand, . six-bedroom lakeside home, a beach property in Florida and a $30,000 . Lexus, investigators found. Colin .

Tough sentence: Hennepin County, Minnesota Attorney Mike Freeman announced at a press conference Friday. 'I will make sure they do hard time.' The Chisholms also had $3 million in bank accounts which they failed to declare, according to Hennepin County Attorney's office. The couple were receiving public assistance for their medical care and food stamps in Minnesota for years while also allegedly collecting welfare in Florida. According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps. Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be desitute. In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with. Colin Chisholm did not declare that he . ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds . championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, of Deephaven, Minnesota, have been charged with wrongfully obtaining $165,000 in welfare and are still at large . Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank . According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean. More than $1 million dollars flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states. The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005. However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim. In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker. Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home. They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views.

"By . Luke Garratt . A Louisiana senator has come out in favor of what he calls 'chicken boxing', a less bloody form of cockfighting, by opposing a bill that would close loopholes in the poultry fighting business and shut down the sport. Republican Senator Elbert Guillory of Opelousas says the bill threatens the 'legitimate, less bloody sport of 'chicken boxing', a suggestion that baffled Senate judiciary committee members and New Orleans Senator J.P. Morrell, who proposed the bill. The bill would tighten the state's cockfighting ban, bringing it up to date with state laws that prohibit dog fighting, by broadening the definition of 'chicken' in the current law to include roosters, game fowl and other birds. Scroll down for video... Senator Guilleroy is claiming that the sport of 'chicken boxing' (pictured) is far less bloody and more of a legitimate sport . The only difference in cockfighting and 'chicken boxing' seems to be what is affixed to the chicken's feet - in the former it is knives or spurs, in the latter it is rubber coating . The new bill would criminalize the possession, manufacturing, buying and . selling of spurs, gaffs and knives if there is evidence the . paraphernalia is being used to fight chickens, and would toughen the . penalties for anyone convicted of cockfighting. Senator Guillory claims chicken boxing is a legal sport - which uses some of the equipment used in cockfighting - but differs because matches are not fought to the death. Senator Guillory described chicken boxing as similar to human kickboxing, with chickens wearing little rubber 'gloves', instead of sharp spurs, on their legs. According to his description, the chickens face off in rounds of ten minutes each, and there is little chance of serious injury to the animals as veterinarians monitor each fight. Senator Guillory said: 'Instead of a blade or exposed spur, they hit each other with these boxing gloves on, which is quite safe. 'There's no blood.' Republican Senator Elbert Guillory (left) of Opelousas says that the bill threatens the 'legitimate, less bloody sport of 'chicken boxing', while his opponent, Democrat Senator J.P. Morrell (right), said he has never heard of the 'sport' Senator Morrell said he was unable to comment because he had never heard of the sport. He said: 'I have no knowledge whatsoever of chicken boxing so I cannot speak to that, I have never heard of that. 'It sounds like something to circumvent cockfighting.' Senator Guillory responded by saying: 'There is a legitimate sport known as chicken boxing. 'It has nothing to do with cockfighting, and it is clear that this bill would interfere, and would criminalize that legal enterprise.' However, according to Senator Morrell, two chickens fighting each other in an arena is already banned under a 2008 Louisiana law that criminalized cockfighting. Cockfighting involves the pitting of two roosters or other game fowl against each other in a ring, with spurs or sharp knives attached to their feet. New Louisiana legislation would tighten up restrictions on the blood sport . Senator Elbert Guillory of Opelousas believes that stricter rules on cockfighting would make the 'legitimate sport of chicken boxing' illegal . The 'sport' of cockfighting is largely known as a very brutal activity that serves as a way to facilitate gambling . Director of animal cruelty policy for the Humane Society of the United States, John Goodwin, said there was no such sport as chicken boxing. He said: 'Chicken boxing is just a creative excuse the cockfighters have come up with to mask their real agenda, which is to maintain the weakest penalties for cockfighting possible.' Cockfighting is a rural tradition in which specially bred roosters, often outfitted with spurs, gaffs or knives, fight to the death while spectators place bets on the outcome of the match. For years, lawmakers resisted animal rights activists' efforts to outlaw it, but eventually gave up in 2007, and the ban took effect a year later making Louisiana the last state to make the rooster fights illegal. Senator Guillory said: 'My concern is about the breadth of this bill. 'It covers all chickens. I represent a rural area where people raise a lot of chickens, including chickens that are 15th- and 20th-generation fighting birds that are exported legally and legitimately to other nations.' Morrell said it was illegal to raise chickens for fighting. 'These are not fighting chickens,' Guillory replied. Senator Guillory intends to carry the . fight into the full senate, as the judiciary committee voted 4-2 to . advance Senator Morrell's proposal.","Senator J.P.

"By . Tara Brady . A feng shui master was buried alive in a landslide at a Chinese cemetery seconds after showing a family a 'perfect burial plot' for their relative's grave. The family of recently deceased De Meng, 75, had invited the feng shui master Zheng Guoqiang, 55, to visit the cemetery in Zhaoqing, Guangdong to see which plot of land could be regarded as 'good land' for a family grave where De Meng could be buried. After surveying the site he took the six members of the man's family to a place where he announced the vibrations and location was perfect for the grave. Zheng Guoqiang was regarded as one of the most famous feng shui experts in Hong Kong but was buried alive . According to the one person who survived, seconds later there was a landslide which buried all seven people, leaving six of them dead. Zheng Guoqiang was regarded as one of the most famous feng shui experts in Hong Kong and was frequently asked about his opinion. Master: Zheng Guoqiang was invited to visit the cemetery to see if the plot of land could been regarded as 'good' A medic treats victims after the landslide in Hong Kong where Zheng Guoqiang was killed . In a city where land is so scarce, many feel it is important to make the right choice when choosing an area for a project, whether that is building a property or finding a site for a grave. Feng shui is widely used in China to orient buildings including tombs in an auspicious manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, a favourable site could be determined by reference to local features such as water, stars, or via a compass. Feng shui was suppressed in mainland China during the cultural revolution in the 1960s but since then has increased in popularity.","Zheng Guoqiang, 55, invited to a cemetery to see which plot was good land .

Google Earth had been trying to get a clear view of the landslide since it first happened, but overcast skies prevented a clear view until March 31. The pool of sludge measuring about 300 acres, which wiped out the mountainside community when it struck on a Saturday morning, stands out against the greenery of the surviving trees. Scroll down for video . Widespread: The scale of the devastating Oso mudslide can be seen from this satellite image taken on Monday . Before: A satellite image shows the mountainside area of Oso before the deadly mudslide struck it on March 22 . About 500 rescue workers are still sifting through the debris, in some places 75ft high, as they search for 22 people who are still listed as missing. Snohomish County has put the current death toll at 27, and 19 of the victims have since been identified. All died from multiple blunt-force trauma, Live Science reported. 'This disaster is quickly becoming one . of the worst in state history,' Washington Governor Jay Inslee said. The landslide was triggered when the waterlogged hillside collapsed at the Stillaguamish river, which is about 50 miles from Seattle. Among the devastation and huge loss of life, there have been a few remarkable stories of survival, like that of Duke Saddarth, a 22-week-old baby who was plucked from the sludge by a driver who was passing as the landslide hit. Selfless act: Kody Wesson carries 22-month-old Duke Saddarth to safety moments after the landslide hit . Kody Wesson ignored state troopers' advice to stay away, and managed to pull the baby and his mother Amanda Skorjanc to safety. 'You gotta help 'em. How can you not? What are you supposed to do, you can't just stand there and watch,' Mr Wesson told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Three men rescued from the landslide are still in hospital. A 37-year-old is in serious condition in . intensive care. An 81-year-old in serious condition in intensive care. And a 58-year-old is in satisfactory condition. The . family of the mother and baby released a statement through the . hospital, saying: 'We are so grateful to all the responders who . jeopardized their safety in order to pull Duke and Amanda out of the . debris. 'Words alone . cannot tell you how thankful we are. Our hearts and support continue to . go out to everyone who has been affected by this tragedy.' The . scale of the disaster is so huge that the sniffer dogs that have been . essential to rescue efforts had to take a break after several long days . of working through the cold mud in nearly nonstop rain. Tribute: A flag flies at half-mast on the flattened landscape where the mudslide struck . Overwhelmed: The wall of mud and sludge carved out a wide path on this Washington hillside in Oso . 'The . conditions on the slide field are difficult, so this is just a time to . take care of the dogs,' Kris Rietmann, lead spokeswoman for the . team working on the eastern portion of the slide, said. If the dogs become worn out they lose their ability to locate human scent among the mud. Dogs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which only arrived recently, will continue to work at the scene while the others take a two-day break. This . weekend, crews completed a makeshift road that will link one side of . the debris field to the other, significantly easing the recovery . operation. They have also been working to clear mud and debris from the . highway. Searchers have had to contend with treacherous conditions.

"By . James Rush . A priest was arrested after he was caught carrying a gun in his back pocket and a bag of marijuana in his hoodie while driving under the influence, police say. University of Alaska Fairbanks parish priest Father Sean P. Thomson, 52, was stopped after police spotted him speeding and weaving across the road. The Catholic priest, who police described as disoriented when he was stopped, handed over a receipt when asked for his vehicle registration. Police claim Father Sean P. Thomson did not mention he had a 9mm handgun in his back pocket after he was stopped while drink driving (file picture) A criminal complaint filed against Thomson claimed he alerted police to a .357 caliber handgun in the back of the pickup truck, but he did not mention a 9mm handgun in his back pocket, according to the Fairbank Daily News Miner. Trooper Christopher Bitz also wrote in the report the priest had a bag with a small amount of marijuana in his hoodie sweatshirt. A preliminary breath test revealed Thomson was three times over one legal standard, but Bitz said the priest refused to take a more accurate test at the Healy trooper post because he 'said he was drunk and did not feel the test was necessary'. Thomson was charged with DUI, refusal to take a chemical alcohol test and drugs misconduct. Thomson is due to appear at the Rabinowitz Courthouse (pictured), in Fairbanks, on Friday . He . was also charged with two weapons offences - possessing a firearm while . intoxicated and failing to immediately inform troopers he was carrying a . firearm.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Police say a man accused of killing his mother and sister in their North Las Vegas home started dismembering one of the bodies and tried to clean up the bloody scene. Detectives think Darius Davon Sorrells, 30, lived for several days at the house with the two corpses before he was arrested by chance after a weekend traffic chase, Police Sgt. Chrissie Coon said on Tuesday. He was named as a suspect on Tuesday by authorities. Sorrells' 53-year-old mother and 33-year-old sister have been missing since last week. Scroll down for video . Darius Davon Sorrells, pictured, has been accused of killing both his mother and sister and dismembering one of the bodies . The Clark County coroner opened two homicide cases, but didn't immediately release the identity of the bodies removed Monday from the home. However, the owner of the 6120 Stibor Street home is listed in county records as Natasha Sorrells, 8 News Now reports. Neighbor Kelly Bacon told the channel that Sorrells and her adult daughter lived in the house. 'They were very quiet, very secluded, didn't say or do much,' Bacon told Fox5Vegas. She also said she saw a younger man walk to house frequently. 'I mean he would sometimes sit in the driveway just waiting for someone to come home I guess,' she said. Detectives think Sorrells lived for several days at the home with the two corpses, seen here . Police went to the home at about 2:30 a.m. Monday to check on the two women, after they were reported missing by family members and friends on Friday. Officers entered through an unlocked back door and found a gruesome crime scene, Coon said. The slayings came to light Monday after . police stretched yellow crime scene tape around the neighborhood and . spent more than 14 hours gathering evidence. Investigators collected evidence and tools that could have been used in the slaying and dismemberment, Coon said. Coroner's investigators even went to the house more than once to retrieve human remains, she said. Coon declined to say where in the home the bodies were found or specify the type of tools involved. 'We don't know yet how they died and which wounds were inflicted post-mortem,' she said. 'It's not exactly clear what the murder weapon was. A lot is going to depend on the results of the autopsies.' Sgt. Chrissie Coon, pictured, said coroner's investigators went to the house more than once to retrieve human remains . Sorrells was already in jail â€” having been found early Saturday by patrol officers looking for a 2004 GMC Envoy being driven erratically in an area a couple of miles from the home. When police approached the vehicle in a shopping center parking lot about 3 a.m., it sped away and at one point drove into oncoming traffic lanes before crashing into a light pole, Coon said. Sorrells fled on foot from the SUV toward nearby railroad tracks before he was caught. 'It was unclear at the time why he ran from police,' Coon said. She said Sorrells was booked on 11 misdemeanor charges, including suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs, obstructing a police officer and driving without a license and insurance. He was being held Tuesday at the Las Vegas City Jail pending an initial court appearance on murder charges in the slaying, as well as the traffic offenses, Coon said. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.","Darius Davon Sorrells, 30, is accused of killing both his mother and sister and dismembering one of the bodies .

"By . Lydia Warren . Prosecutors today showed jurors the bloody stiletto a woman allegedly used to stab her University of Houston professor boyfriend to death last year. Ana Trujillo claims she was acting in self defense when she stabbed Alf Stefan Andersson 25 times in the face and neck with the 5-inch-high navy pump, which was found beside his body on June 9. The shoe, which was stained with a dark substance, was shown in court in the second day of the murder trial in Houston, Texas on Tuesday. Jurors were also shown a crime scene video of Andersson's apartment that captured his bludgeoned body in a pool of blood, the Houston Chronicle reported. Demonstration: Prosecutor John Jordan uses a dummy to show how Ana Trujillo could have used her shoe as a deadly weapon . 'Murder weapon': In court on Tuesday, prosecutor John Jordan sets down a stiletto shoe that Ana Lilia Trujillo allegedly used to repeatedly stab her boyfriend following an argument last June . Emotional: Trujillo, left, reacts to hearing the 911 call recording during her trial in Houston on Tuesday . The 911 call Trujillo made after the early-morning attack was also played in court. As she listened, she wept and held a tissue to her face. It was difficult to understand Trujillo on the call, and the 911 operator seemed to be unsure if she was reporting an assault or that someone was injured and needed medical help. When the operator realized someone needed medical attention, she transferred the call to medical services, which directed Trujillo to perform CPR. Trujillo said she was already doing that. 'I need help,' she could be heard saying on the recording between cries and deep breaths. 'I hit him with my shoe. He's on the floor, he's bleeding a lot.' She adds: 'He started beating me up.' Trujillo's attorney Jack Carroll is expected to make the same tape part of her claim of self-defense. On Monday, her lawyers said she stabbed Andersson, 59, because she couldn't handle his physical attacks anymore. They accused him of being an alcoholic, and described the alleged murder weapon as more of a platform-heeled shoe, not a pointy stiletto, despite what has been reported in the media. Evidence: Jordan shows the jury a stiletto-heeled shoe entered into evidence during the trial . In court: Houston police officer Ernest Aguilera examines the stiletto that she allegedly used to stab her boyfriend 25 times in the face and neck, killing him . Examination: The shoes, pictured being handled by Aguilera, were found by the victim's body . Bloodied: Prosecutor John Jordan holds up a pair of bloody jeans worn by Alf Stefan Andersson the night he died as police officer Chris Duncan testifies during the trial against Trujillo . Prosecutor Sarah Mickelson on Monday said the two had . a fractious relationship and that Trujillo had a history of losing her . temper with Andersson. The couple got into an argument after an evening of heavy drinking. Trujillo and Andersson had . spent most of the evening at Bodegas, a local taco shop, where they . drank a couple bottles of wine and took a few tequila shots. But things turned sour that night . when another man approached Trujillo at the bar and offered to buy her a . drink. Andersson got jealous of the stranger's advances which spurned a . fight back at his apartment around 2 a.m. The ensuing fight was so loud that neighbors thought it sounded like furniture moving. When . Andersson grabbed her, Trujillo told police that she pulled his hair - . so much so that she had clumps of it in her hands. When that didn't stop . him she started beating him with the shoe. Killed: She has claimed that she stabbed Alf Stefan Andersson, pictured, in self defense . Accused: Ana Trujillo sits in court before opening arguments in her trial in Houston on Monday. On Tuesday, jurors heard her 911 call after she allegedly stabbed her boyfriend to death with a stiletto . Fallout: Before the murder, the couple had been drinking heavily at this taco restaurant when a man offered to buy Trujillo a drink, which sparked a fight back at the couple's home later that night . Trujillo phoned police just before 4am . to the victim's high rise building and answered the door covered in . blood. 'It looked like . something out of a horror movie,' Assistant Harris County District . Attorney Sarah Mickelson said. 'There was so much blood, the police . officer thought Stefan had been shot in the face.' Scene: She called police to the couple's apartment where they found his bludgeoned body . Mickelson said Andersson had been stabbed and was 'beaten to bloody pulp.' Upon entering, police found Swedish Anderson in a hallway, with Trujillo's stiletto next to him. The police report detailed about 10 puncture wounds to the head as well as 15 to 20 wounds on his face and neck. Trujillo, a mother of two who's out on bail, has pleaded not guilty. She was acting in self-defense, her attorney, Jack Carroll, said. 'Stefan Andersson grabbed her, they started wrestling, he got on top of her and she couldnâ€™t breathe,' Carroll said before the trial started. 'He got her in a hold.' Carroll has also stated his brave choice to put his client on the stand. 'Iâ€™m going to have limited time to try to get a jury to understand that although Ana has had problems in the past, she is a kind person at heart,' he said to ABC News. Trujillo admitted in June that she killed Andersson in a lover's spat at their apartment. While . Trujillo claims she acted in self-defense, that doesn't change the . charges, according to Sara Marie Kinney, a spokesman for the Harris . County District Attorney's office. 'She confessed to doing it. The reason and all of that will play out in court,' Kinney said.","Ana Trujillo, 45, faces life in prison if convicted of the June 9 murder of Alf Stefan Andersson, a professor at the University of Houston .

"By . Jonathan O'callaghan . Imagine the full stop at the end of this sentence was a camera. It might sound unbelievable, but that’s exactly what U.S. technology company Rambus have built - an incredibly tiny device no bigger than the tip of a pencil. In reality though, it’s not really a camera but rather a tiny chip embedded in a piece of glass that converts the light it receives into an algorithm to create pictures. The researchers behind the project, David Stork and Patrick Gill, say their lensless invention could hypothetically allow almost any device to contain a camera. Now you see it: The lensless camera (left) is tiny compared to a traditional smartphone camera (middle) and pales in comparison to the size of a coin . It works by using a . tiny chip known as a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) embedded in a paper-thin piece of glass. As light hits the glass, the imager processes the light into an algorithm. Etched patterns on the glass then refract the light in different ways as it passes through. At . this point the image is unrecognisable but, ultimately, the algorithms . reconstruct the light into a recognisable image that mimics the real . object. At the moment the . images are relatively blurry at a resolution of just 128x128, but as the . technology is advanced it’s likely its capability will get better and . better. The technology is still in its infancy, but this prototype shows just what could be achieved by this sort of technology in future. Without requiring a lens, future gadgets like smartphones could be made smaller and smaller while still possessing picture-taking abilities. Further down the line it’s possible the technology could be embedded into everyday items like clothes, mirrors and toys to give us entirely new methods of interactivity.

They go on to add that the device is ‘so inexpensive’ that it should find use in ‘a number of single-use scenarios, for instance in surgery and warfare. Imagine: Here, John Lennon's face has been recreated by the lensless camera by processing the light from a picture of the famous Beatles star .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . A man on trial for murdering his wife in their California home wept in court Tuesday as prosecutors told jurors they have evidence that proves he beat the Muslim woman to death two years ago. Defendant Kassim Alhimidi wailed during opening statements, prompting a judge to briefly halt the proceedings. Alhimidi is accused of killing his 32-year-old wife Shaima Alawadi on March 21, 2012, in El Cajon, a San Diego suburb that is home to one of the largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants in the U.S. Tears: Kassim Alhimidi, on trial in El Cajon Superior Court for the 2012 murder of his wife, Shaima Alawadi, weeps during opening statements in the courtroom of Judge William McGrath Tuesday . No weapon has been found in the brutal slaying but prosecutor Kurt Mechals claimed that other evidence proves Alawadi died at the hands of her spouse. Alhimidi, 49, has pleaded not guilty in the case that evolved from being a suspected hate crime to one about a family that struggled while trying to straddle two cultures. Mechals told jurors that local and federal police initially investigated the bludgeoning as a hate crime after a note was found near the body that read: 'This is my country, go back to yours, you terrorist.' However, street camera footage and information from the couple's eldest daughter about her parents' troubled marriage led police to charge Alhimidi. Lab tests found the note was a photocopy - possibly of a note found outside the family home a week earlier by one of the couple's five children. Comfort: Kassim Alhimidi, on trial in El Cajon Superior Court for the 2012 murder of his wife, Shaima Alawadi, is comforted by one of his lawyers, Richard Berkon . Killed: Alawadi, 32, was found beaten and unconscious in her San Diego home in March 2012 . Detectives also found documents in Alawadi's car indicating she planned to seek a divorce. Alhimidi's . daughter, Fatima, who was then 17, is expected to take the stand at the . trial in San Diego County Superior Court in El Cajon. Alawadi, . who wore a headscarf, was found by Fatima in a pool of blood on the . kitchen floor with her body tangled in a computer cord and desk chair. She had multiple skull fractures from blunt force and died two days . after the attack. A sliding glass door was shattered. 'To this day, we still don't know what the object was,' Mechals told jurors. However, a medical examiner is expected to testify that it appeared Alawadi was beaten with a tire iron. Defense . attorney Douglas Gilliland said the prosecution has no solid evidence . and instead based its case on interpretations of blood stains on the . floor, street camera footage tracking Alhimidi's van, and information . from the couple's daughter, Fatima, who had been at odds with her Muslim . parents over dating a Christian boy. Final journey: Family and friends escort Mrs Alawadi's body to a waiting hearse following the memorial service in 2012 . Gilliland said no blood or shards of glass from the shattered door were found on Alhimidi. Gilliland . pointed out that Alhimidi, who is not fluent in English, has cooperated . with authorities, even returning early from Iraq, where he buried his . wife. He also said Fatima has given conflicting reports, saying at first . that she saw an intruder and later that she only saw her mother . bleeding on the floor when she came downstairs. Mechals . described Alhimidi as a man who was distraught over his wife's plan to . leave him and had urged his children and relatives to get her to stay. After . the attack, Alhimidi went to the hospital, touched his wife as she lay . unconscious in bed, and apologized to her, Mechals said. An uncle of the . children who was present told authorities that Alhimidi then turned to . him and said that if his wife woke up, she might try to say that he had . attacked her. Crime scene: The fatal attack took place at the family's house, pictured, in El Cajon, California . 'If Shaima Alawadi did wake up, she would have said he did this to her, because he did,' Mechals told jurors. Gilliland countered that the uncle always disliked Alhimidi, and cultural misunderstandings have clouded the truth. The defense lawyer said Muslims often apologize to loved ones who are dying for all the things that they did or didn't do for them in their lives. In U.S. courts, that can be seen as an admission of guilt, he said. 'It doesn't translate,' Gilliland told jurors. Prosecutors say camera footage indicates that Alhimidi might have driven a short distance from home on the day of the attack and parked his car - contradicting his story to investigators that he had gone for a drive to relax. The footage shows a person getting out of a parked red car resembling Alhimidi's vehicle around the corner from the home and then walking back to the vehicle an hour later.","Defendant Kassim Alhimidi wailed during opening statements, prompting a judge to briefly halt the proceedings .

Mason Rudder, from Kansas City, had a birthday to remember on Sunday when he spent the day going through weapons and explosives training before getting to fire a gun and blow something up . The whole experience was a dream coming true for Mason who wants to be a Navy SEAL when he grows up . According to Mason’s father, George, his son’s fascination with the SEALs was partly fueled by the fact his uncle was a SEAL and his grandfather was in the Air Force. Mason enjoys playing military games around the house and so his parents arranged the Navy SEAL For A Day training as a birthday surprise. ‘He’s all boy,’ his father told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Mason was born with a genetic disorder (Escobar syndrome) that causes limited movement and a decreased range of motion. He is about 3½ feet tall and weighs just 32 pounds and had already endured 10 surgeries. His older sister, Haley, 7, also has the disorder; while their brother, Collin, 9, doesn’t. Mason Rudder, from Kansas City, was in his element as he spent the day going through weapons and explosives training before getting to fire a gun and blow something up . The young boy helped his team enter the lair by detonating a real bomb similar to ones used in the 2011 mission to capture Osama bin Laden at his compound in Pakistan . Mason was trained on Sunday by ex-Navy SEAL Jared Ogden who offers training to military service members and the police. He helped Mason hold several high-powered rifles and handguns, then Mason’s final ‘mission’ was to raid the hideout of a Taliban leader. The young boy helped his team enter the lair by detonating a real bomb similar to ones used in the 2011 mission to capture Osama bin Laden at his compound in Pakistan. Mason said that detonating the bomb was his favorite part of the entire training day. At the end of training, Ogden pinned a Navy Seal trident on the young boy’s sweatshirt. In his final mission, Mason got to stick the explosives on the door of the building . A day to remember: Team Mason poses for pictures on the young boy's sixth birthday .

"By . Luke Garratt . Chinese parents have admitted to putting their son in chains and refusing to let him go as a punishment for constant stealing. Father Wen Yuan, 47, chained up his son, Chuang, 24, because he believed his thieving habits had brought shame on the family. As a result he tied his son to his bedroom in their house in Xibianban village in south China's Jiangxi province, for fear that if he didn't stop his son from stealing, he would soon end up in jail. Chuang Wen Yuan (pictured) with his neck in chains in an attempt by his parents to get him to stop stealing . Chuang was chained by the neck to a heavy concrete block, which he placed in the boy's bedroom so that he couldn't do anything but move around the room and sit in his bed. Wen Yuan said: 'It isn't exactly a large community here, when something is stolen . everybody knows who's to blame. 'I always had to compensate my neighbours . and apologise for what he had stolen if I couldn't return it and I just . got fed up with it. 'I can't keep paying compensation all the time . because I just can't afford it and eventually someone was can call the . police and he would have been locked up. Chuang Wen Yuan had been stealing things around the neighbourhood to the point that his parents could no longer keep bailing him out . Chuang's parents tied him by the neck to a concrete block that his father found, so that he could not leave his room . 'I don't think once you been . jailed would be any chance of correcting him and so we have kept him at . home and chained him up to remind him exactly what a wonderful thing is . to have freedom.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Spike Lee has blasted a New York Times film critic who claimed his recent criticism of gentrification in Brooklyn was hypocritical because he lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The filmmaker delivered an expletive-filled lecture at Pratt Institute for Black History Month in February about white 'hipsters' acting like Christopher Columbus and 'kill(ing) off the Native Americans' in the borough. Commenting on the 7 minute rant, A.O. Scott wrote in Sunday's Times: 'As is often the case with Mr. Lee's public utterances, this one was a mixture of hyperbole, provocation and plain truth... What's the saying about people who live in glass brownstones?' But the article incensed Lee so much that he penned an open letter Monday to the critic defending his Brooklyn credentials and his ability to comment on the changing face of the borough despite moving away. Scroll down for video . Angry: Spike Lee, pictured, has blasted a New York Times film critic who claimed his recent criticism of gentrification in Brooklyn was hypocritical because he lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side . 'Your criticism of me as a hypocrite is lame, weak and not really thought out,' he vented on social media website WhoSay. 'You stated in your Article that because I live in The Upper East Side and I'm talking about Gentrification that makes me Hypocrite. The fact is where I live has nothing to do with it. Your argument is OKEY DOKE.' Critic: Commenting on the 7 minute rant, A.O. Scott, pictured, wrote in Sunday's Times that it was hypercritical . He went on: 'The Truth is The Truth. The . Truth is The Light... The Truth is Gentrification is Great for the New . Arrivals in Harlem, South Bronx, Bushwick, Red Hook, Bed-Stuy Do or Die . and Fort Greene, and in many other cities across the U.S. But not so great for The Brown and Black Residents who have been in these Neighborhoods for decades and are being forced out, to the Suburbs, Down South or back to their Native Islands.' Outlining his Brooklyn background, he explains that his family moved from his native Atlanta to settle in Crown Heights when he was 3. He said his parents bought their first home in 1968 in Fort Greene, where his Father still lives. 'Mr. Scott, what you fail to understand is that I can live on The Moon and what I said is still TRUE. No matter where I choose to live that has nothing to do with it. I will always carry Brooklyn in my Blood, Heart and Soul.' Comparing himself to rapper Jay-Z, who has Brooklyn roots but now resides in Tribeca, Lee wrote: 'Did anyone call Jay-Z a Hypocrite when he helped with bringing The Nets from New Jersey to The Barclays Center in Brooklyn at the Corner of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenue? 'Hey Buddy, Jay-Z had been long, long gone from The Marcy Projects and Brooklyn a long, long, long time ago and more Power to my BK ALL DAY Brother. Should Jay-Z no longer mention Brooklyn in his Songs because he no longer resides there?' Films: Many of Lee's films including 1989's Do The Right Thing, pictured, were filmed in Brooklyn . He then ranted about all the movies he's made and that, by Scott's logic, he shouldn't have written and directed the films because he didn't live in the neighborhoods where they were set. In a final assault, he concluded the letter by listing many Brooklyn natives who still hold the borough dear despite living elsewhere now. 'It doesn't matter where you choose to live because Brooklyn goes where you go,' he wrote. 'It still lives inside Larry King, Sandy Koufax, Big Daddy Kane, Bernard and Albert King, Barry Manilow, Stephon Marbury, Rhea Perlman, Adam Sandler, Neil Sedaka (and) Jerry Seinfeld,' and the list went on before signing off from 'Da Republic of Brooklyn, New York.'","The filmmaker delivered an expletive-filled lecture for Black History Month in February about 'Christopher Columbus syndrome' in the borough .

"By . Neil Moxley . Pepe Mel’s grip on his job at West Bromwich Albion is loosening amid chaos and growing tension behind the scenes at the Hawthorns. Mel, 50, has failed to win in six matches, taking four points from as many home games, but owner Jeremy Peace is understood to be unhappy with the situation and may even follow Fulham’s lead and make a second managerial switch if matters do not improve quickly. West Brom are just one point above the relegation zone following an horrific run since November of just one victory in 15 matches. Frustration: West Brom manager Pepe Mel, left, has failed to win in six matches and his methods are being called into question by the squad . Flashpoint: Mel calms down Fulham defender John Heitinga and West Brom's Youssuf Mulumbu after Saturday's 1-1, which did neither team any favours in their Premier League survival bid . Little impact: Mel was announced as West Brom boss on January 16 but has yet to lead the team to a victory . Concerned: West Brom's Jonas Olsson, right, and Gareth McAuley, left, fear their lack of pace will be exposed by the tactics of Mel . They returned early from a break in . Jerez last week and there has already been one clear-the-air meeting . between Mel, the coaching staff and the players, with former caretaker . Keith Downing acting as the go-between. The . first team are unhappy at Mel’s insistence on playing a pressing game, . high up the field. Centre-halves Gareth McAuley and Jonas Olsson are not . the quickest and they fear they will be exposed by these tactics. The . players favour a return to Roy Hodgson’s methods which led to their . highest Premier League finish, of eighth, two seasons ago. Their view . has been communicated to Mel and a new blueprint is reportedly being . discussed this week. However, . there is also disquiet about David McDonough’s role as director of . technical performance. The Spanish-speaker was a prime mover in the . appointment of Mel, a team-mate of Benitez in the Real Madrid youth . team. Disquiet: Dave McDonough, who used to work for Liverpool, is having his role as West Brom's director of technical performance questioned . Time for a fresh approach: West Brom sacked Steve Clarke in December . McDonough was understood . to have been among those present when Steve Clarke was sacked in . December, a fact that did not sit comfortably with several members of . the backroom team. West Brom’s . sporting and technical director Richard Garlick is also new to his role . but McDonough appears to have usurped him too, carving out a niche for . himself within the club that has not been well received. Crucially, . however, the former Liverpool employee does appear to have the backing . of the club’s owner, Peace. With . all of these issues swirling around the training ground, West Brom have . also taken the decision to restructure their scouting department. Distant memory: West Brom striker Saido Berahino, left, celebrates after scoring the winning penalty . against Newcastle on January 1, 2014 - the last time the Baggies tasted victory . However, . the manner of the changes left a nasty taste in the mouths of staff . with former midfielder Bobby Hope, the chief scout, and head of . European recruitment Tony Spearing both in the line of fire, along with . chief scout Stuart White. West . Brom insisted on Tuesday that Mel’s position was under no immediate . threat. They added that McDonough had reverted to his original role as . head of analysis and was undertaking no duties on the training field . with regard to the first team. Next up: Manchester United and Wayne Rooney will face West Brom at The Hawthorns on March 8 . The . club also confirmed that several positions were being re-designated . among their recruitment staff but insisted that the end of Hope’s . employment was amicable. The Scot has given 26 years’ service to West . Brom as a player and, latterly, as a scout. West . Brom have long been championed as a club that punches above their . weight but the loss of former technical and sporting director Dan . Ashworth to the FA, plus a succession of poor decisions in the transfer . market, have contributed to the current position. With . Manchester United their next opponents at the Hawthorns on March 8, it . may well be that Mel’s problems worsen, inflaming an already combustible . situation, before they get better. A protege of Rafael Benitez who worked for best part of two decades at Liverpool. Brought in as head of analysis by Jeremy Peace to improve data collection on transfer targets. However, the loss of Dan Ashworth to the FA left a vacuum. With Richard Garlick new to the technical director role, McDonough has stepped into the void.","Pepe Mel under pressure amid growing tension behind the scenes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Dangerous joke: Police say Angela Timmons, pictured, 54, who works at Virginia Colleges in Spartanburg County, texted her daughter just after 10 a.m. claiming she 'could hear gun shots being fired inside the school' A South Carolina woman was arrested today after an April Fools Day prank went terribly wrong. Police say Angela Timmons, 54, who works at Virginia Colleges in Spartanburg County, texted her daughter just after 10 a.m. claiming she 'could hear gun shots being fired inside the school.' However, the daughter, April Timmons, who lives in New York couldn't get hold of her mom after receiving the message and, c-oncerned, the 34-year-old proceeded to call 911 to report the incident. Sheriff's deputies swarmed the college where they discovered that no shooting had occurred. Sheriff Chuck Wright told WPTV that he was expecting to find a serious situation as he approached the school. 'I'm thinking Columbine High School, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech,' he said. However, the daughter soon called back after receiving a second text from her mom explaining that it was a prank. When questioned by Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office deputies, Angela Timmons, who works in 'financial planning' for the school, according to her Facebook page, said she sent the text as a joke. She said she 'sent the text as an April Fools joke and that she has done such jokes on April Fools in the past.' In the message, Timmons claimed to her daughter that she was 'hiding in a bathroom for her own safety.' Scene: Sheriff's deputies swarmed the college, pictured, after the call but arrived to learn that no shooting had occurred. Worried: The daughter, April Timmons, right, who lives in New York couldn't get hold of her mom, left, after receiving the message and, concerned, the 34-year-old proceeded to call 911 . According to investigators, there was 'no record' on Timmons' cell phone indicating that she revealed to her daughter that the text 'was only a joke.' Wright said he was relieved there wasn't really a shooting but he said was very disappointed at the woman's poor choice. 'Text someone and tell them their tire's flat, that's funny,' Wright said. 'We're talking about death. It's real. The people of Sandy Hook, when they see this online they're not going to think it's very funny. I don't think it's very funny.' He said his deputies responded to the scene very quickly and were prepared to give their lives to save students and staff. Timmons was arrested and booked into the Spartanburg county Detention Center. She is being held there on charges including aggravated breach of peace and disturbing a school.","Police say Angela Timmons, 54, who works at Virginia Colleges in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, texted her daughter just after 10 a.m. Tuesday claiming she 'could hear gun shots being fired inside the school'

"By . Taylor Auerbach . Published: . 02:48 EST, 2 April 2014 . | . Updated: . 06:34 EST, 2 April 2014 . A Scottish-born man living in Australia has won the right to be legally recognised as neither a man or a woman. 'Norrie', who only goes by their first name, underwent surgery to become a woman but has won the right to be considered 'gender neutral'  in a case that could have repercussions around the world. The Sydneysider had gender reassignment surgery in 1989 but stopped taking hormones and now sees their sex as 'non-specific'. Scroll down for video . Androgynous victory: 'Norrie' won the right to be recognised as neither male nor female. The decision is a first and has similarities to cases before the courts in the US . After a grueling High Court hearing, a panel of judges agreed. The case was referred to the highest court in the country by the NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages after Norrie applied for a name change and attempted to register as having no gender. The registrar first granted Norrie's wishes but later reneged. Norrie challenged the decision and eventually the NSW Court of Appeal found the registrar was legally able to recognise genders other than male and female. Norrie wanted to be known as neither male or female - and an Australian court agreed that a person should have the right to consider themselves 'gender neutral' in a landmark case worldwide . That finding was challenged by the Registrar and the case moved to the High Court in November last year. A full bench of the court released its historic findings on Wednesday. 'Not all human beings can be classified by sex as either male or female,' the finding reads. 'The question in this appeal is whether it was within the Registrar's power to record in the Register that the sex of the respondent, Norrie, was, as she said in her application, ""non-specific"". That question should be answered in the affirmative.' The court ordered the state pay Norrie's appeal costs. 'Not all human beings can be classified by sex as either male or female,' the court found . The court also found that the NSW Anti Discrimination Act 'recognises that a person's sex may be indeterminate'. They dismissed the appeal of the NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages, ordered them to reconsider Norrie's application 'in accordance with these reasons' and ordered Norrie's costs of appeal to be paid by the Registrar. It is expected the finding will pave the way for people in NSW and Australia to register as gender neutral. Landmark: Norrie's lawyers expect the finding will apply to other Australian states with similar legislation . 'Many other people let me know they wanted to (identify as non-specific) in Australia and indeed around the world,' Norrie told reporters in Sydney. 'Maybe people will understand there's more options than the binary.' As the decision was made in Australia's highest court, it is expected to be binding on other Australian states - such as Victoria and Queensland - with similar legislation. The Scottish-born Norrie underwent sex-change surgery in 1989 but decided to stop taking hormones . The case has similarities with that of Valeria Jones, currently before American courts. Jones is suing former employee Bon Appetit Management Co, an Oregon catering company, for $518,000. Jones alleges in a lawsuit that coworkers commonly used female terms when referring to them despite them identifying as gender neutral, The Oregonian reports. The lawsuit claims Valeria 'cried regularly at work and at home during this time'. In a similar case in the US, Portland lawyer Donel Courtney (pictured) is currently representing an Oregon person who identifies as gender neutral .","Australian high court grants Norrie the right to be neither man or woman .

"By . Hugo Gye . The brother of notorious crime bosses Terry and Tommy Adams was arrested along with his wife in a dawn raid today as part of a money-laundering investigation. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Octopod arrested a total of seven people this morning, including an accountant and a solicitor, in a series of raids across London. They also seized around £100,000 in cash  from an office believed to be one of the Adams 's headquarters. Michael Adams, 48, and his wife Debra, . 46, were seen shouting as they were bundled into a van by officers . outside their home in Finchley, north London. Raid: A group of Metropolitan Police officers executing a search warrant on the home of Michael and Debra Adams in north London . Going in: The moment officers smashed open the door and entered the premises . Bundled out: Michael Adams, brother of gang leaders Terry and Tommy, was led out of his house . Arrest: A total of seven people have been arrested following raids on eight different properties . Members of the Adams syndicate have been linked to at least 25 murders worldwide, as well as drug trafficking, extortion, hijacking and white-collar crime. The group detained today, including a trained accountant turned property developer and a solicitor, are suspected of laundering millions of pounds through an investment scheme. The raids were carried out under the Proceeds of Crime Act and included specialist financial investigators, the Territorial Support Group, the dog unit, local police teams and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. They executed search warrants simultaneously at seven residential addresses in Limehouse, Shoreditch, Hendon, Finchley, Dartford, Dorking and Rye. Struggle: Michael Adams tried to hide his face from photographers during the arrest . Operation: Adams shouted as he was taken into a police van following the dawn raid . Questioning: The 48-year-old was put into a police van and driven to a station to be questioned . Coming out: Debra Adams, the wife of Michael Adams, was also arrested in the raid . Led away: Mrs Adams being escorted from the scene by two female police officers . Home: The house in Finchley pictured in the aftermath of the police raid in the early hours of this morning . Brothers: Terry Adams, left, and Tommy Adams, right, have previously been jailed for their links to the gang . Allegedly one of the UK's most powerful organised crime syndicates, the Adams Family has been linked  to at least 25 murders worldwide, as well as drug trafficking, extortion, hijacking and white-collar crime. Terry Adams first formed the group with his brothers Sean and Patrick in the Clerkenwell area of Islington, north London, in the Eighties, and it gradually expanded over the years to include other relatives and close friends. The gang allegedly grew through extortion, security fraud and the hijacking of gold bullion shipments, eventually forming international links with various criminal organisations, particularly Latin American drug cartels. They are said to have developed links with corrupt Metropolitan Police officials and even one Tory MP, and allegedly worked with Jamaican Yardie gangs to silence informants and neutralise rivals. Before the convictions of Sean and Terry Adams, the failure to make charges stick against members of the gang had led to speculation they had undermined the British justice system to become untouchables. The latter, widely believed to be the leader of the gang, was so effective at distancing himself from the sharp end of his alleged criminal business that he was only convicted with the assistance of MI5, the domestic spy agency. At his trial, prosecuting barrister Andrew Mitchell QC said of Terry Adams: 'It is suggested that Terry Adams was one of the country’s most feared and revered organized criminals. 'He comes with a pedigree, as one of a family whose name had a currency all of its own in the underworld. 'A hallmark of his career was the ability to keep his evidential distance from any of the violence and other crime from which he undoubtedly profited.' Detectives . are continuing to carry out searches of the premises, but they have . already seized items such as financial documents, computers and mobile . phones, which will be sent away for forensic examination. Four men and three women, aged between their 30s and 70s, were held by police, although none has been charged with a crime. The . latest arrests bring the total number linked to the Adams family to 22, . following similar raids in February when almost £300,000 in cash was . seized along with a haul of deadly weapons. One raid was carried out on a £2.5million central London mansion owned by Tommy Adams, 55, and his wife Androulla, 54. Tommy . - who once led the syndicate with his brothers Terry and Patrick - was . jailed for seven and a half years in 1998 after admitting his role in an . £8million cannabis smuggling plot. Terry, who has not been arrested in the raids, was jailed for seven years in 2007 after being convicted of money laundering. Octopod is the biggest operation to date against the organised crime group. Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Manson said: 'This is continuing activity, bringing together some of the Met's most skilful teams to target a highly harmful organised crime group which we believe also has links across Britain and Europe. 'The group as a whole is known to be involved in serious and violent crime which is harming people and damaging communities across London. We believe those arrested today are laundering huge quantities of cash. 'We believe they - with other members of the group - are responsible for a multi-million pound criminal business, the proceeds of which are laundered and either pumped into other illegal money-making schemes or spent on luxurious living. 'Operation Octopod is a demonstration of the sheer investigative force the Met can apply to organised gangs - some of whom think they can hide criminal cash from the police.'

"By . Taylor Auerbach . When 19-year-old Jarrod Lawrence made the harrowing decision to turn off his mother's life support last month he knew an almighty struggle had begun. The latest in a string of tragedies, it marked the moment Jarrod was left to care for his two teenage brothers by himself. With medical bills of their own, a massive mortgage on the family's western Sydney home and at least 10 more years of education costs, the Lawrence boys (Jarrod, Blake, 16, and Dylan, 14) faced life as orphans. Struggle: Jarrod Lawrence, with girlfriend Nelly, has been left to care for his younger brothers Blake, 16, and Dylan, 14, after the death of their mother earlier this year . And without the roof over their head, the boys would have to split up and move into separate foster families. Their father Christopher died on February 2, 2008 'in unfortunate circumstances'. Mum Natalie died on March 17 this year after suffering two brain aneurisms. She was buried four days later, on Jarrod's birthday. 'It's a tragedy, I still choke up thinking about it,' John Frew, principal of the boys' high school in Holsworthy, told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's heartbreaking for everybody, the eldest boy has become the head of the family and he had to make the decision to take his mother off life support. 'I went to the dad's funeral too, it's been devastating. But in all the sadness, I feel a lot of pride.' And well he might. The boys' gut-wrenching story caught the attention of Channel 9 prime time television program A Current Affair and something very special happened. Their uncertain future was profiled on March 31 to an Australian audience in the millions and producers encouraged viewers to donate money to a bank account set up in Jarrod's name. A Current Affair reporter Brady Halls said he expected humble donations to trickle in from the public and more sizeabale ones from big businesses. But what has happened over the last 48 hours has shocked everybody. Orphans: Dylan Lawrence, 14, (left) and Blake, 16, struggled to cope with the deaths of their parents . Swell of support: The Australian public have so far donated $750,000 to help (left to right) Dylan, Blake and Jarrod after their story appeared on A Current Affair . Thousands of donations have poured into the brothers' bank account from Australians rich and poor. Brady Halls choked back tears as he told viewers of an $8,000 donation from an elderly woman caring for her husband suffering from dementia. This morning an emotional Jarrod Lawrence told Daily Mail Australia he and his brothers had so far received an astonishing $750,000. And the figure is still climbing. 'It's great, it's just amazing, unbelievable' he said. 'It's been tough, but we'll get through.' Jarrod is no stranger to turmoil. In addition to losing both parents in the space of six years, his youngest brother Dylan underwent brain surgery in 2012 to have tumours removed. He is now on the mend. 'They're going OK,' Jarrod said. 'We're sticking together. The school's been great, everyone's been great.' The huge monetary gift means the three brothers will now be able to stay together in Holsworthy. Uniform costs and school fees have been waived by Holsworthy High School and principal John Frew said Jarrod, who has ambitions of being a primary school teacher, has picked the right career path. 'He's got a certain inner-strength and I'm encouraging him to be a teacher, he would be fantastic,' Mr Frew said. 'I always thought he'd be a PE teacher but I think he'd be great in primary school, he's a great role model.' Role model: Former principal of Jarrod Lawrence said the 19-year-old would make an excellent school teacher . Figure climbing: Jarrod Lawrence logs into his bank account as donations fly in by the minute . Family tragedy: Youngest brother Dylan been treated for brain tumours but is now making a good recovery . In addition to the thousands of heartwarming donations from the public, mostly anonymous, businesses around Australia have also thrown cash into the Lawrence boys' coffers. Channel 9 donated $20,000; colourful businessman Dick Smith pledged the same amount; Kurri Kurri mining company Alfabs Mining gave $10,000. A nine-year-old boy, named Quentin, chucked in $121 with the help of his brothers Cody and Romeo. The boys' Queensland grandmother, pensioner Jan Lingard, sobbed almost uncontrollably when it was revealed on live television on Tuesday night that the appeal had raised $550,000. 'Thank you, thank you Australia, thanks everybody, they deserve it,' she said. '(Daughter Natalie) was an angel and now she's a real angel. She would be so proud of these boys.' The brothers are all keen sports fans and are being helped through their heartache by teammates. Jarrod told Daily Mail Australia that once the mortgage and bills were taken care of, all financial decisions would be shared by the inspiring young trio. 'I'm going to put some money away for brothers' future wants and then ask them what they want to do,' he said. Donations can be made to the Lawrence boys by depositing money into the following bank account: Jarrod James Lawrence, Commonwealth Bank, BSB: 062 322, Account Number: 1042 0700 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tiger Woods has had surgery on his ailing back and he will miss the Masters for the first time in his career. Woods said on his website that he had surgery Monday in Utah for a pinched nerve that had been hurting him for several months, knowing the surgery would keep him from Augusta National next week for the first time since he was in high school. The No. 1 player in the world is a four-time Masters champion. Disappointment: Tiger Woods will miss the Masters because of back surgery - his back has become increasingly troublesome and the golfing legend spoke last month at the World Golf Championships about the agony he was going through . 'After attempting to get ready for the Masters, and failing to make the necessary progress, I decided in consultation with my doctors to have this procedure done, Woods said. 'I'd like to express my disappointment to the Augusta National membership, staff, volunteers and patrons that I will not be at the Masters. 'It's a week that's very special to me,' he said. 'It also looks like I'll be forced to miss several upcoming tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation and getting healthy.' The Masters gets the highest television ratings of any golf tournament, and while Woods last won a green jacket in 2005, he commands most of the attention. He won his first Masters in 1997 when he set 20 records, from youngest Masters champion (21) to his 12-shot margin of victory. Woods has been coping with back issues since last summer — a twinge in the final round of the PGA Championship, spasms in the final round of The Barclays that caused him to fall to his knees, and then it returned with alarming regularity during the Florida swing. He withdrew after 13 holes in the final round of the Honda Classic with what he described as lower back pain and spasms. Beginning of a legend: Masters champion Tiger Woods receives his green jacket from the previous year's winner Nick Faldo in 1997 - he has won four Masters titles . Agony: Tiger Woods grimaces after teeing off on the 12th hole during the final round of the Cadillac Championship golf tournament in Doral, Florida and pauses for a moment at the 17th hole on March 9 . Woods shot the highest final round of his career at Doral a week later when he said his back flared up again in the final round. He skipped the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he was the two-time defending champion, to rest his back and do everything possible to be at Augusta National next week. He said he had a microdiscectomy for the pinched nerve, performed by neurosurgeon Charles Rich. A microdiscectomy is a type of minimally invasive spine surgery to relieve pressure and pain caused by a herniated disc. Operating through a small incision in the lower back, surgeons remove small disc fragments that are pressing against spinal nerves. Recovery can take several weeks and doctors typically advise against bending and twisting the back until patients are completely healed . 'This is frustrating,' Woods said. 'But it's something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long-term health.' Upsetting: Tiger Woods looks down during a news conference at the Newseum in Washington, Monday, March 24, 2014 when discussing his ability to compete at this years Masters tournament in Augusta, Georgia .

Carted off: Woods is driven off the course after picking up a neck injury at the Players in 2010 . Woods said he hopes to return to golf this summer, though he could not say when. It's possible he could at least start chipping and putting in three weeks. His website said Woods could have sustained more damage if he had continued to play. He will have to wait until the U.S. Open — maybe longer — to resume his quest to reach Jack Nicklaus' record 18 professional majors. Woods won his 14th major at the 2008 U.S. Open on a badly injured left leg that required season-ending surgery two days after his playoff win at Torrey Pines. He has not won another major since then. Racking up the green: Woods won the Masters in 2005 . Last triumph: Woods stands with runner-up Rocco Mediate after winning the US Open in 2008 after a play-off at Torrey Pines . Nice fit: Woods adjusts the Masters green jacket in 2002 after his win at Augusta . Silver service: Woods looks at the British Open trophy after his win in 2005 . Woods has 79 career wins on the PGA Tour, three short of the record held by Sam Snead. He already was off to the worst start of his career. He missed a 54-hole cut at Torrey Pines, where he was the defending champion. He tied for 40th in Dubai, and then withdrew from the Honda Classic and tied for 25th at Doral. 'It's tough right now, but I'm absolutely optimistic about the future,' Woods said. 'There are a couple (of) records by two outstanding individuals and players that I hope one day to break. As I've said many times, Sam and Jack reached their milestones over an entire career. I plan to have a lot of years left in mine.' 1995 - Withdraws from US Open on sixth hole of his second round after injuring left wrist playing out of heavy rough . 2002 - Had his second knee surgery to drain fluid around his left ACl and remove a number of cysts . 2007 - Ruptured his ACL running on a golf course, however, plays through the pain for the season . 2008 - Undergoes surgery on his left knee after the Masters in April . 2008 - Wins US Open in June, despite being told he had two stress fractures in his left tibia . 2010 - Neck problems down his right side forces him to withdraw from the Players . 2010 - Reveals he had a cortisone shot to help ease 'lingering soreness' in his Achilles in December . 2011 - Sustains a minor sprain to his left Achilles playing from under the Eisenhower tree at the Masters . 2011 - Withdrew from the Players for the second consecutive year after Achilles, knee and calf problems . 2012 - Driven off the course on the 12th hole of March's final round of the WGC at Doral after more pain in his left Achilles . 2014 - Withdraws from the Honda Classic with back problems . The recovery time is listed as two to three months before that usually happens, which would clearly leave him in a race against time to be ready for the meat of the summer programe. Then there’s the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September. To play in that, he would almost certainly need a wild card and while captain Tom Watson would be happy to hand him one if he has fully recovered, would a man who has undergone such an operation really want to be on a course in the heat of competition for as many as 12 hours a day? Whatever happens, this is unquestionably another massive blow for Woods, who has been blighted by one injury after another in his thirties. The most serious came in 2008, when he tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out of action for eight months. He has also withdrawn from events owing to his achilles and a bad neck. In 2011, he failed to tee it up at the US Open and the Open because of an Achilles complaint. It is all a far cry from 12 months ago when he returned to the top of the world rankings with an eighth career victory at Bay Hill and third of the season. This was supposed to be the year when Woods got back on the majors trail after a drought stretching back almost six years. Now the future looks more uncertain than ever.

"By . Sara Malm . Most people enjoy a game of Jenga in the kitchen on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but these American farmers decided to play the big game - by knocking down a silo. The video starts as the man has knocked down nearly half of the concrete panels, and the demolition process is near an end. The construction, which appears to be a concrete stave silo, would previously have been used to store grains or food for livestock. The man behind the camera can be heard shouting that he has never 'dropped' a silo before, and the ensuing near-death experience proves it. Seconds later, the man with the hammer whacks away the last bearing panel, and has to run for his life as the entire concrete tower comes down from above. Bringing down the house: When the video begins, the man had already taken down a significant portion of the silo's panels . Let's play Jenga! The unidentified man swings a sledgehammer and whacks away at the concrete panels on a silo . Getting there: The man takes the concrete panels down one by one to see which one will be the final 'straw' for the silo . Timber!

"By . Bianca London . The Prince of Wales was advised of the best way to drink cider wearing a straw mask today as he came face to face with members of an ancient folk group on a visit to Northern Ireland. The Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall encountered a troupe of enthusiastic mummers, clad head-to-toe in woven straw costumes, as they toured Enniskillen Castle museum in Co Fermanagh. After getting a close-range blast from one of their hunting horns, Charles commended the present-day generation of Aughakillymaude mummers, who still perform mid-winter plays to ward off evil spirits, for keeping the century-old rural art alive. 'I'm so glad you keep that tradition going,' he said. Scroll down for video . The Prince of Wales looks bemused as he meets a group of Irish Mummers at Enniskillen Castle museum at the beginning of a two day visit to Northern Ireland . Captain Mummer Jim Ledwith told the Prince that the good times flow when mummers, who are also known as the Men of Straw, meet up with similar groups from England. 'It helps if they are cider drinkers,' he added. Noting the potential impracticalities of drinking while wearing a face-covering straw hat, Charles enquired: 'But you take the lid off first before you pour it in?' Captain Ledwith agreed that was the best strategy to employ. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall paid a visit to Enniskillen Castle museum on a sunny day in Northern Ireland . The Prince encountered a troupe of enthusiastic mummers, clad head to toe in woven straw costumes . Something funny, Charles? After getting a close-range blast from one of their hunting horns, Charles commended the present-day generation of Aughakillymaude mummers . Turning to another straw man, the Prince remarked: 'By God, you must get pretty hot in there.' 'It gets hot surely,' replied the mummer. 'You don't want to have hay fever.' Charles and Camilla are on a two-day visit to Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen Castle museum being the first engagement. After arriving at Enniskillen Airport, they travelled the short distance to the landmark stone edifice on the banks of Lough Erne, which houses military and non-military historic collections. Enniskillen has the unique honour of being the only town in Great Britain and Ireland to give its name to two regiments; the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (infantry) and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards (cavalry), now part of the Royal Irish Regiment and the Royal Dragoon Guards respectively.

The Duchess of Cornwall receives flowers from pupils during her visit to Enniskillen in County Fermanagh . The royal couple, accompanied by Lord-Lieutenant of Co Fermanagh Viscount Brookebrough and Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office Andrew Robathan, were welcomed by a group of Union Flag-waving school children and by the pipes and drums of the Royal Irish Regiment band. Inside they visited an exhibition on an ancient 'crannog' settlement, uncovered during a recent road construction project in Enniskillen. The Prince then moved to the rifle range where the curator of the Inniskillings Museum, Neil Armstrong, gave him an overview of the site's history. Elsewhere, the Duchess viewed a display of Belleek China, for which Co Fermanagh is famous, and saw traditional methods of butter-making in an adjacent display.

The royal couple then attended a reception in the nearby 1881 building which was attended by around 120 guests drawn from a wide range of organisations associated with the museum. The Duchess had the opportunity to view some of the exhibitions from Action Mental Health, including local basket-makers, and sample some Co Fermanagh produce. During the visit, the couple also had the chance to view a painting of the Queen's visit to Enniskillen on her Jubilee tour of 2012, depicting her walking the short but symbolic journey from St McCartin's Church of Ireland cathedral across the road to St Michael's Catholic church. On their second engagement of the day, the pair visited one of Northern Ireland's most beautiful houses and gardens at Florence Court. The popular tourist attraction consists of an 18th-century mansion, surrounded by gardens and parkland which extends to 250 acres. Formerly the home of the Earls of Enniskillen, Florence Court was gifted to the National Trust by Michael, Viscount Cole in 1953 and, following a major fire in 1955, the house was restored in a major conservation project.

"By . Lizzie Parry . He disappeared for five days embarking on a 17-mile trip, leaving his owners distraught. When Crockett the cat went missing Pauline and Bill Lowe desperately hoped he would return to their Essex home. But the couple, both 66, never imagined just what their treasured pet had been up to. For the adventurous grey tabby had indulged in a little sofa surfing, getting trapped inside an old three-seater destined for the charity shop. Reunited: Delighted Pauline and Bill Lowe were reunited with missing Crockett five days after he disappeared from their Essex home. The grey tabby got trapped in an old sofa the couple were donating to a charity shop . There he lay for four days quietly hiding in the piece of furniture donated to the St Luke's Hospice charity in Grays Essex, by the 66-year-olds. Workers collected the old sofa, complete with Crockett lurking inside, from the Lowe's Corringham home. For four days Crockett hid inside the sofa, on the shop floor, without detection despite being surrounded by unsuspecting volunteers and bargain-hunters. The trapped cat was only discovered when the new owners, who asked not to be named, noticed meowing sounds coming from inside the three-seater. The bemused couple called the hospice shop to alert them to their unexpected free gift. Crockett is now back at home and has now been given a clean bill of health after his sofa surfing adventure. Adventurous: Ten-year-old Crockett lay hidden inside the sofa on the shop floor for four days as bargain-hunters and volunteers went about their business . The relieved owners believe their . curious cat sneaked inside the sofa’s body when it was taken apart to . allow it to be removed from the house. Mrs Lowe said: 'We noticed Crockett was missing straight away but could not think where he might have gone. 'He doesn’t go anywhere so I was really worried.' The couple searched high and low for their missing moggy but were only reunited after St Luke’s staff received the bizarre phone call from the sofa’s new owners. She added: 'The whole family are delighted to have Crockett back. 'He is a lovely cat and we were devastated when he went missing - our other cat Tubbs was missing him too. 'We can’t believe how he must have tucked himself into the inside of the sofa during the short time the bottom had been removed and remained silent for so long.' The couple have owned Crockett since he was a kitten and say this is the first time he had ever disappeared. Jenny Munro, manager for St. Luke’s, said: 'I couldn’t believe what I was told when a customer phoned to say that they had bought a sofa from our shop and that they were delighted with the purchase except for the fact it had a cat inside. 'Apparently the new owners of the sofa heard a soft meow sound. 'On further investigation of the sofa they saw two claws poking out of the material which moved away when touched. 'In order to release the cat they had to rip the material under the sofa as Crockett had lodged himself well into the back. 'After giving the cat some TLC, a good drink and food they contacted us. 'Everyone is happy with the outcome and we have all been saying how amazing the chain of events was and what a very lucky cat Crockett was as had the sofa been disposed of in other ways Crockett may not have been found.' Round-trip: Crockett the cat travelled 17 miles from his owners' home in Corringham, to the shop in Grays. He then travelled from there to the sofa's new owners' home in Grays and back to be reunited with his the Lowes in Corringham . Discovery: The new owners of the three-seater sofa, bought at the St Luke's Hospice charity shop in Grays (pictured), only discovered Crockett after hearing meowing coming from inside their new piece of furniture .","Crockett the cat went missing from his Essex home last week .

"By . Tara Brady . Japan's yakuza gangsters have launched its own website complete with a corporate song and a strong anti-drugs message as its membership falls to its lowest ever level. The 'Banish Drugs and Purify the Nation League' website has been created by the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest organised crime group. It includes shakily-shot footage of members making their New Year pilgrimage to a shrine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The 'Banish Drugs and Purify the Nation League' website has been created by the Yamaguchi-gumi . The soundtrack is a traditional folk-style song with lyrics extolling the virtues of the 'Ninkyo' spirit - an ideal of masculinity that battles injustice and helps the weak. 'Nothing but Ninkyo, that is the man's way of life,' say the lyrics. 'The way of duty and compassion, bearing the ordeal for our dream.' Another video shows men with crew cuts pounding sticky rice for a New Year festival and there are galleries of pictures showcasing the clean-up work members did in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami and the 1996 Kobe earthquake. The website is not the Yamaguchi-gumi's first foray into media - the crime syndicate last year began publishing a magazine for its members that includes a poetry page, senior gangsters' fishing diaries and a message from the boss. Like the Italian mob or Chinese triads, yakuza syndicates are involved in activities ranging from prostitution to extortion and white-collar crime. But unlike their underworld counterparts elsewhere, the yakuza are not illegal and each of the designated groups, like the Yamaguchi-gumi, have their own headquarters, with senior members dishing out business cards. They have historically been tolerated by the authorities, sometimes with corrupt police overlooking their violence, and are routinely glamorised in fanzines and manga comics.However, membership at an all-time low. A screen grab from the Banish Drugs and Purify the Nation League website set up by yakuza gangsters . A video which features a corporate song includes shakily-shot footage of members making a pilgrimage to a shrine . Members of the Yamaguchi-gumi which is not illegal and even have their own headquarters . Periodic crackdowns have gained momentum and there is evidence the mob's appeal is waning.The number of people belonging to yakuza groups fell to an all-time low in 2013, slipping below the 60,000-member mark for the first time on record, police said last month. An increasingly poor public image and Japan's economy have made the lives of the gangsters difficult which has made membership less attractive for potential recruits, experts said. The website, which looks outdated, is an attempt to counter the yakuza's image as 'anti-social forces' by showing how neighbourly its members are, experts say. One page shows men collecting litter along the banks of the Toga River near the Yamaguchi-gumi's headquarters in Kobe, western Japan, with a nearby sign reading: 'Purge yakuza.' Kenichi Shinoda (centre), the boss of Japan's largest 'yakuza' gang, the Yamaguchi-gumi, in 2011 . Jake Adelstein, a journalist and author who has written extensively on organised crime in Japan, said the Yamaguchi-gumi's online offering was an effort to prove its humanitarian credentials. 'By presenting an anti-drugs theme, it shows concern for social welfare, it shows pictures of the group doing emergency relief after the (2011) and Kobe earthquakes,' he told AFP. He said it was true that the yakuza made use of their 'ties to the trucking industry and their abundance of cash, lack of red tape and institutional memory' to provide help after the disasters. But, he added, 'there was a certain amount of self-interest involved - getting in with the locals helps them get a share of the reconstruction money.' Adelstein, whose account of his life working the crime beat for a Japanese newspaper is being made into a film starring Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe, said the site was an attempt to whitewash an unsavoury truth. 'The yakuza motto is ""help the weak and fight the strong."" In practice, it's usually the reverse,' he said. Police officials said they could not immediately confirm the website was made by the Yamaguchi-gumi, nor comment on it.

"By . Tara Brady . and Damien Gayle . Yashika Bageerathi will be put on a flight at Heathrow Airport at 9pm this evening . An A-level student's last-ditch bid to delay her deportation so that she could appeal her case has been denied. A . judge at London's Law Courts refused to grant an emergency injunction . to block the removal of Mauritian teenager Yashika Bageerathi from . Britain. The 19-year-old . will now be sent back alone to her home country, separated from her . mother and her siblings, after immigration authorities refused her claim . for asylum. The decision . slaps down a high-profile campaign which had sought to reverse the . decision to deport Ms Bageerathi, a promising student, before she was . able to take her A-level exams. The . teenager had been held at Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Detention . Centre in Hertfordshire since March 19, and is due to board an Air . Mauritius flight back to Port Louis, the Mauritian capital, tonight. A . spokesman for the Oasis Academy Hadley in Enfield, north London, where . Ms Bageerathi was a student, earlier said that the youngster was 'very . distressed and worried' at the prospect of her deportation. 'We’re . encouraging everyone to tweet Air Mauritius and to phone them to stop . this,' he added, speaking as Ms Bageerathi was being transported to . Heathrow by immigration officials. Ms . Bageerathi has earlier sobbed as she told her school friends she . 'feared for her life' when she was suddenly told at 3.30pm that she was . due to board a plane in less than six hours. Two previous attempts to deport her were stopped when airlines reportedly refused to let her board their aircraft. Her . deportation was branded 'outrageous' by her headteacher who said Ms . Bageerathi was an 'exceptional' case that should stop her being kicked . out of the country. The . teenager fled from Mauritius in 2011 and claimed asylum last summer . alleging she suffered physical abuse from a relative. She was living in . the UK with her mother, younger sister and brother. The 'gifted' schoolgirl was due to take her A levels next month. Ms . Bageerathi was allowed one phone call before being made to leave and . broke down as she told her teacher at Oasis Academy in Enfield, north . London what was going on. Lynne . Dawes, headteacher of the school, said: 'She was crying and just . doesn't know what to do. She's scared for her life right now. 'It's . outrageous to send a young girl back to a really dangerous situation. It's not even common sense. People are rightly outraged. 'We are absolutely devastated at this news. We have not been given any notice that this was going to happen.' Demonstrators gather in London, to protest against student Yashika Bageerathi being deported . The . move comes after a long campaign by teacher, students and politicians . to try and convince the Home Office that Ms Bageerathi should be able to . stay here with her family. A petition calling for her deportation to be blocked attracted around 175,000 signatures. 'We . are devastated, the students are devastated,' Ms Dawes said. 'They have . all have worked really hard to keep their friend with them here in the . community and we have supported them.' Yashika was due to take maths, further maths, chemistry and French in her A levels in May and was predicted As or A*s. 'She's . very gifted. She teaches the younger students and she teaches her . peers. She did lots of fund raising for the school and helped out at out . community events. 'She was very much involved in our school community,' Ms Dawes added. Demonstrators with banners gather in Parliament Square, London, to protest against the deportation of student Yashika Bageerathi . Despite the widely supported . campaign, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told a Commons Home . Affairs select committee yesterday Ms Bageerathi must be deported. The . Conservative said all the facts of the case involving Ms Bageerathi had . been considered but were not deemed to be of the 'exceptional nature' required for intervention. She was due to be deported on Mother’s Day but her removal was deferred. Mr . Brokenshire remained steadfast on the controversial decision despite . pleas from fellow MPs to show 'compassion' as he appeared before the . committee. Her tearful . mother Sowbhagyawatee Bageerathi appeared briefly before the committee . with David Burrowes MP and headteacher of Oasis Academy Hadley, Lynne . Dawes, breaking down as she told the committee: 'I saw her (on) Mother’s . Day.' Support: The case sparked a petition which attracted 175,000 signatures but Ms Bageerathi was detained . She called for the minister to free her daughter from Yarl’s Wood, adding 'it’s not a place for her, it’s a place that is cruel'. Mr Burrowes, Tory MP for Enfield Southgate, had tweeted earlier today that Mr Brokenshire 'just replied to my reps and says he “can find no compelling and compassionate circumstances (in her case)'. Mr Burrowes said the Home Office was in contact with the British Council, the UK's international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, and told him Ms Bageerathi could complete her A-levels in Mauritius. He added the department said there were good universities in Mauritius for the student to attend. But the MP said: 'Yashika needs to be able to finish with the support of her family and friends. The Home Office has ignored their own policy. Demonstrators gather in Parliament Square, London, to protest against the deportation of Yashika Bageerathi . Students at Oasis Academy Hadley, in Enfield, demonstrate against the deportation of their friend Yashika Bageerathi . 'As her headteacher said, 80 per cent are over 18 when they take A-levels. The guidelines apply to people taking A-levels.' Mr Burrowes said the options to stop the deportation were limited unless the teenager's lawyers get a last-minute injunction to stop it. He condemned today's actions as 'far from compassionate' and that it was 'compelling she should stay'. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told a Commons Home Affairs select committee yesterday Ms Bageerathi must be deported . But a Home Office spokeswoman disputed Mr Burrowes' claims and said guidelines regarding deportation after examinations apply only to under-18s taking GCSEs and A-levels. She added: 'We consider every claim for asylum on its individual merits and in this case the applicant was not considered to be in need of protection. 'The case has gone through the proper . legal process and our decision has been supported by the courts on five . separate occasions.' Promising . student Yashika came to the UK with her mother, sister and brother in . 2011 to escape a relative who was physically abusive and claimed asylum . last summer. She was due to take her A-level exams next month, with the first on May 14 and the final one will be held on June 23. The committee heard that her age means she is not protected by deportation rules that protect children sitting examinations. But . lawyers for Ms Bageerathi had hoped to make an application to the High . Court today for the student to be given an interim period to stay in the . UK to complete her A-levels, Ms Dawes said. The headteacher said they were now trying to lobby support to stop tonight’s deportation and get 'the message as far as we can' that she should stay. Ms Dawes said she had spoken to the student less than an hour before and that Ms Bageerathi was 'really upset and absolutely devastated'.","Yashika Bageerathi due to board a flight at Heathrow Airport at 9pm .

"By . Martin Robinson . This is the moment the driver of a £300,000 Lamborghini was pulled over by police last night - just a mile from where another Aventador was wrecked in a three-vehicle smash on Mother's Day. Scotland Yard officers stopped the 217mph supercar on Park Lane yesterday after months of trouble with playboys racing through London's most exclusive streets. The driver of the rare yellow Lamborghini was stopped by police on motorcycles, who then took his details.  It is not clear whether the affluent motorist had been speeding or if another offence, like driving without the necessary insurance, had occurred. Residents of Knightsbridge, which has . an average house price of £3.6million, have complained for years that drivers from the Gulf have been racing through their streets.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A married couple claim they were victimised at work due to their religious beliefs after being refused holidays during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Donna Tunkara, 32, and husband Yassin, 31, say they suffered discrimination, harrassment, victimisation and constructive dismissal after bosses at the Portrack Lane warehouse in Stockton-on-Tees of supermarket giant Morrisons turned down holiday requests in 2012. A tribunal held at Teesside Magistrates’ Court yesterday heard evidence from Mrs Tunkara, who says her holiday request for the last 10 days of fasting during Ramadan was turned down unfairly. Donna Tunkara and husband Yassin claim they were victimised after being refused holidays during Ramadan . She added that the stress of working night shifts caused her to suffer a breakdown and be admitted to hospital. However solicitor Philip Crowe, . representing Morrisons, called Mrs Tunkara a 'liar' during cross . examination and said that she had not got the holidays she asked for . because she missed a deadline - meaning all holiday time was already . taken. He said: 'You have not got exactly what you wanted and acted like a spoiled brat, and you have taken the easy way out to play the discrimination and race card, haven’t you? It is unfair.' Mrs Tunkara rejected accusations that she had fabricated her story, and said that she and her husband had enjoyed their job at the Stockton base. She said: 'No it was not the easy way out. 'It was very difficult to deal with. We asked for the holidays because it was too difficult to work night shifts while fasting.” Mr . Crowe had asked Mrs Tunkara why the couple, from Linthorpe, . Middlesbrough, had not put in their holiday requests by the end of . February, the company deadline for summer requests. He also challenged her over discrepancies in the dates she claimed to have had meetings with managers. The married couple, worked here at Morrisons Distribution Centre on Portrack Lane, Stockton-on-Tees . Mrs Tunkara said she had been admitted to hospital after working a shift on August 11, 2012, and had not even recognised her husband in the immediate aftermath. She also claimed that she had asked for time off for her and her husband between August 9 and August 22 at the beginning of March, as soon as she received a planner from her mosque telling her when Ramadan was to begin. She told the tribunal her line manager Peter Woodward had taken the request while he was in a meeting with another person. Directly after, he told Mr and Mrs Tunkara he had discussed Ramadan with the other person and had decided he would not grant the request, claims Mrs Tunkara. Mr Crowe denied this incident ever took place, and asked why Mrs Tunkara had only mentioned it in her latest witness statement. He also asked her why, after working during the first weeks of Ramadan in July and August, did she only suffer problems while working shifts during the period she had asked to have off. Mrs Tunkara said she had come to a compromise to work shorter, seven-hour shifts, and split her 30-minute breaks in two but the cumulative stress of working while fasting had led to her breakdown. She also said she and Mr Tunkara had been denied informal 15 minute breaks other staff enjoyed on night shifts, and that her request for holidays had been treated differently to requests from other members of staff. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Donna Tunkara and husband Yassin were refused time off during Ramadan .

"By . Amanda Williams . Coronation Street star Barbara Knox's daughter has been banned from the roads for two years after she was arrested for drink driving . The daughter of Coronation Street actress Barbara Knox - who plays Rita Tanner - has been banned from the roads for two years after she was arrested for drink driving. Maxine Ashcroft, 56, was stopped by police while driving home a relative - believed to be Ms Knox - from a family gathering in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. The veteran ITV star, 80, later arrived at the police station and was arrested herself on suspicion of drink driving. She has been bailed pending further inquiries. Ashcroft was arrested after a member of the public following the Jaguar reported to police they thought the driver was under the influence of alcohol, Macclesfield magistrates heard. Shortly after, police stopped Ashcroft in Knutsford, Cheshire on the evening of March 10. She was said to have smelt of 'intoxicants' and a roadside test was returned positive. The defendant was taken to Middlewich police station and gave a breathalyser reading of 97 microgrammes (mg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath - three times the legal limit of 35mg. Today Ashcroft, of Kencot, Lechlade, Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty to drink driving. Representing her, Nick 'Mr Loophole' Freeman, told the court: 'She is thoroughly contrite and ashamed. 'She has let herself down and her family down. She accepts full responsibility for her actions. She is the author of her own misfortune. 'She made a terrible error of judgment which is going to have terrible consequences for her. This was a classic case of alcohol anaesthatising good sense.' Mr Freeman appealed to the magistrates to . lessen the length of the ban due to the circumstances of his client. The divorcee had recently moved from Cheshire to a rural location where . the nearest shop was six miles away. Mr Freeman said: 'I don't like to use the word recluse but literally her driving licence is her lifeblood. 'She does not have anyone to drive for her. Scroll down for video .

The court heard she had 'close family ties' with her parents who she saw on a regular basis who 'she cares for as a daughter and is trying to look after them as much as possible'. Sentencing her, chairman of the bench Graham Hall told her: 'Miss Ashcroft, I do not think you need me to tell you how serious this is and how foolish and dangerous this act was.' He said the bench had considered a community sentence to go alongside the ban but imposed a fine instead after they took into account her remorse, her personal circumstances and her good character. Ashcroft was fined £960 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £96. Knox was not present at court. Actress: Mrs Knox is one of the longest serving actresses in soap opera history .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Gift: The 40-year-old schizophrenic, who believes he is a prophet, fought his mother in a legal battle to let him donate a tenth of his inheritance to the Latter Day Saints . A delusional man who believed he was a prophet has been given free reign to donate nearly £7,000 to the Mormon Church by the Court of Protection - against the wishes of his family. The mother of the schizophrenic had been fighting to block her 'vulnerable' 40-year-old son from making a 'tithe', an Old Testament concept ordering Christians to donate 10 per cent of their earnings to the Church. But today, District Judge Anselm Eldergill ruled there was 'no reason' to stop the man doing as he pleased. The unidentified donor told the court: 'I simply wish to abide by the Old Testament principle of giving a 10 per cent . tithe. This is standard practice in my church; not me being exploited. 'Generally, . I wish to enjoy the right of obeying my church's teachings on financial . matters. With regards to my financial affairs, my decision to give a . tithe to my church is both rational and Biblical.' The man had said he had given a tithe of around £1,600 to the Latter . Day Saints about a decade ago when he was 'well' adding: 'I had been . tithing since early 2004 when I discovered the verse in which members of . my church are commanded to start tithing in this way.' According to Judge . Eldergill, the man's mother told the court that she was . 'surprised and distressed' by the case. 'We have no idea how much pressure is put upon [him] by his church to donate or tithe his money,' she said. 'I am personally strongly opposed to [him] being permitted to make a donation of this size.' Psychiatrists disagreed about the man's 'capacity' to make the gift, Judge Eldergill revealed. One said the man had the capacity to 'make a gift on the tithes principle'. Distress: His mother told the secret court her son was too vulnerable to decide for himself. He intends to make a 'tithe', an Old Testament idea where Christians donate 10 per cent of their wealth to the Church . Another said the man was making the request in the context of his . 'psychotic illness' and 'delusional ideas regarding religion' and the . request should be 'disallowed'. Judge Eldergill concluded that the man had an 'impairment' of the mind and a 'delusional belief' that he was a prophet. Old Testament law required Christians to 'tithe', where they offer 10 per cent of everything they earn to the Church. Advocating multiple tithes, it often ended up being around 25 per cent. It is believed by many to have been invented as a tax to subsidise priests' income. It was never advocated in the New Testament. Today, Mormons are still required to tithe to achieve salvation. Catholics in some countries are also required to tithe, although churches now recommend a donation of around three per cent. But . he said: 'Although, on the evidence, I have accepted that his belief . that he is a prophet is a delusional belief, that does not mean that all . of his religious beliefs are delusional or compromised by the presence . of mental illness. 'The fact that a person has a grandiose belief . with a religious content does not demonstrate that the whole of their . religion is delusionally-based and caused by mental illness.' He . added: 'In what way, therefore, does his belief that it is necessary or . appropriate to give a tithe stem directly from his delusion that he is a . prophet or constitute an extension of it?' Judge Eldergill said the . fact that relatively few people tithe now was 'neither here nor there' and it was not enough that others thought the proposed tithe 'unwise', a . 'misinterpretation of a religious text' or 'misguided'. But the judge said it was relevant that the man's belief was a 'matter of faith'. 'It cannot be demonstrated that [his] desire to give this money to the . Mormon Church is part of his delusional belief system,' Judge Eldergill . concluded. Although psychiatrists disagreed about the man's 'capacity', Judge Eldergill ruled in the man's favour . 'The issue is finely balanced. In my view, the presumption of capacity has not been displaced.' The . judge added: 'His belief that he is a prophet does not impinge on his . capacity to argue and present his case with regard to the tithe and the . other litigation issues. He has prepared and presented his case very . ably and I cannot identify any point of substance in support of his . position that he has not articulated.' Judge Eldergill said he had noted the man's mother's 'strong opposition' and her 'sincere concern' for his welfare. But the judge said her objections were of 'limited assistance' in determining the man's 'capacity and best interests'. And he said there was no evidence that 'pressure had been applied' by the church.","Man pledged 'tithe', Old Testament concept of donating 10% of wealth .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Guilty: Kirk Thompson, 46, pictured today, has been convicted of the manslaughter of David Kochs, 43, during a drug-fuelled sado-masochistic sex session at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle . A former government vet has been convicted of killing a man during an extreme drug-fuelled sadomasochistic sex session. Kirk Thompson, 46, caused severe internal injuries to David Kochs, 43, during the episode at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle, after the pair met on the internet. He then covered his body with a duvet, before having sex with another man. Police found Mr Kochs dead in flat following day. Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter and actual bodily harm but was today found guilty by a jury. Newcastle Crown Court heard both men had been taking the drug crystal meth when they engaged in the violent episode at Thompson's flat in the city's Jesmond area in March last year. The jury was told that the defendant 'enjoyed inflicting pain on others' and that night he boasted on the internet about the kind of activity the two had engaged in. At some point during the evening, Thompson, a former altar boy, became aware that Mr Kochs was either dead or unconscious, and he covered him with a duvet on the floor of his living room. He then had sex with another man he invited round and had also met online as the body of Mr Kochs lay in the flat. The next morning, after the second man had left, Mr Thompson messaged his father and said: 'Can you come down immediately, something tragic has happened, just you not Mum please ASAP.' On arriving at the flat, his father quickly dialled 999 and paramedics and the police arrived at the scene. After arresting him, Thompson told police the men had engaged in 'extreme no limits anything goes sex' but he believed Mr Kochs had been asleep and that was why he covered him with the duvet. The jury found him guilty of the manslaughter charge as well as one of actual bodily harm. Mr Justice Globe said sentencing would take place tomorrow and told Thompson that a sentence of imprisonment was the only one that he should expect. Scene: The former vet covered his victim's body with a duvet, before having sex with another man. Police found Mr Koch's body in the flat in Jesmond, Newcastle, pictured, the next day . Appearance: Thompson, pictured arriving at court, met Mr kochs online. The court heard both men took the drug crystal meth before the sex session . 'There is only one sentence that can be imposed and it is a custodial sentence,' he said. 'I will be giving consideration to what it should be and I will hear submissions tomorrow morning.' In other evidence, the court heard Thompson had used the Nazi term 'SS' in internet messages with potential partners as part of 'a silly game'. He explained how he had contracted HIV in his third year of his veterinary medicine degree at Edinburgh University, when he was around 22, but did not take a test for another 10 years, as there was no cure at the time. Case: Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter at Newcastle Crown Court but was found guilty by a jury . In the meantime, he studied in the U.S., graduated from Edinburgh, won a scholarship to Oxford and also worked part-time at a local vets in the city. He eventually moved to Defra, based in Whitehall, in 2003 and during the 2004-5 bird flu scare said he worked on guidelines on how to deal with the threat. But he had to leave Whitehall, despite being tipped for the top role of Chief Vet by his boss, he said, and moved back to the North East where his parents lived. He will be sentenced tomorrow.","Kirk Thompson caused David Kochs internal injuries during sex session .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The Environment Agency spent almost £1million of taxpayers' money hiring dredging equipment after selling its own machines for just £200,000. A request made under the Freedom of Information act has revealed that over the past year the quango spent £839,564 renting machines to keep rivers, streams and canals clear. The equipment was hired a total 141 times in the same 12 months that the agency received £233,000 after selling eight long-reach excavators used to clear waterways at an auction. The Environment Agency, which started dredging the River Parrett yesterday, spent almost £1million hiring dredging equipment after selling its own machines for just £200,000 . A request made under the Freedom of Information act has revealed that over the past year the quango spent £839,564 renting machines to keep rivers, streams and canals clear . Dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels finally began this week after the area was hit by the worst floods for 250 years. But campaigners believe that had the dredging process begun earlier the floods which destroyed homes after the heaviest . January rainfall on record might have been avoided. And angry locals have questioned what is being done to prevent their homes and businesses from being flooded in the future. An employee at the Environment Agency has claimed that river dredging had to be put back after the body was unable to hire equipment from its preferred source as the machines were not available. Dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels finally began this week after the area was hit by the worst floods for 250 years . 'As with every decision our directors make there was no backup plan or contingency plan so it was chaos for many months and this was a contributing factor to the recent flooding I am sure,' the staff member wrote in a letter to the Daily Telegraph. In the past 14 years the Environment Agency has sold five dredgers and 14 dragline excavators - receiving £112,626 for nine of the machines, although the sum paid for the other 10 was unavailable. One long-reach excavator was sold at auction in December last year for £47,000. In 2013 11 new long-reach excavators, capable of removing earth and debris from underwater, were purchased to replace the eight sold. In the past 14 years the Environment Agency has sold five dredgers and 14 dragline excavators - receiving £112,626 for nine of the machines . The Environment Agency had planned to sell three long-reach excavators at an auction near Hereford in February, but the items were withdrawn because parts of the country were still swathed in floodwater at that time. Instead it was decided that the machines, which were eight years old and due to be replaced, would be re-conditioned and returned to service. The agency, which currently has 49 long reach excavators, four dredgers and one dragline, said it hired machinery to support its work when necessary as this provided 'better value'. Diggers began scooping silt from a . 200-metre stretch of the River Parrett, near Burrowbridge, as the . multi-million scheme got underway yesterday. Engineers will clear around five miles of the river and the . neighbouring River Tone in the programme - which is expected to take . several months. Around 6,500 properties, including these homes in the village of Moorland, were flooded this winter after three months of heavy rainfall . Members of the armed forces were brought in to help in flooded areas, moving sandbags to protect homes . It is hoped the £5.8million dredging will . improve the capacity of the rivers, which are currently operating at . just 60 per cent, and reduce flooding in the future. Around 6,500 properties were flooded this winter after three months of heavy rainfall. Dr Paul Leinster, Chief Executive at the Environment Agency, said:'We are committed to dredging as part of the joint action plan which includes other measures such as supporting farmers and making some temporary flood risk management measures permanent. 'We will continue to work closely with Defra, Somerset County Council and other partners to reduce the impact of future floods.' It is hoped the £5.8million dredging will improve the capacity of the rivers, which are currently operating at just 60 per cent, and reduce flooding in the future . The dredging forms part of the ‘Somerset Levels and Moors Flood Action . Plan’, commissioned by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, and was . made possible by additional Government funding announced earlier this . year. Some of the removed material will be used . by the Environment Agency for flood bank repairs and construction to . further improve flood resilience of the area. 'It is vital that our flood-hit communities know this activity is taking place to give them some reassurance, but dredging is only part of the solution,' said John Osman, Leader of Somerset County Council Council. 'The Somerset Moors and Levels Flood Action Plan is key to reducing the risk of flooding in the future and we will work hard to win the funding necessary to deliver it.'","Environment Agency hired equipment 141 times in 12 months .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Injuries: George Milis, 43, was left with burns on his right eyeball, chin, cheek, forehead and nose after an Asda ready meal 'exploded in his face' A man has been blinded in one eye and left with painful burns all over his face after a microwave ready meal exploded in his face. Security supervisor George Milis popped the Asda Classic liver and bacon with colcannon mash into the microwave oven for his lunch at work. Mr Milis, 43, claims he followed the instructions ‘to the letter’ and heated the food for ten minutes. But when he took it out and peeled back the film the meal exploded, spraying scalding liquid all over his face as well as the walls and ceiling of the canteen. Colleagues quickly washed the sizzling liquid from his face but the piping hot food had already burned his right eyeball - as well as his cheek, nose, chin and forehead. Mr Milis is still without proper vision in his right eye - two weeks after the freak explosion - and fears he might never fully regain it. The married father-of-one said: 'I peeled the film back and stirred the meal and the next thing I knew there was a bang and the meal had exploded. 'The plastic was intact, but burning hot liquid and bits of food were everywhere. 'It was on the ceiling, walls and all over me - absolutely everywhere. It was all over my face and in my eyes and ears.' Mr Milis was rushed to the nearby South Bristol Community Hospital where A&E nurses said his burns would have been much worse had he not been close to a sink. He added: 'The burns on my face are so painful, but I’m most worried about my sight in my right eye. Followed the instructions: Mr Milis says he followed the instructions on the packaging and heated the liver and bacon with colcannon mash for 10 minutes in the microwave . 'I’ve been told the liquid burnt my eyeball and my vision’s still blurry - I’m not sure how much it’ll recover.' His wife Melanie bought the £1.50 meal from a local Asda in Bedminster, Bristol, and Mr Milis says he is grateful they didn’t cook it at home. He said: 'We have a five-year-old and I just dread to think what would have happened if my wife had cooked that meal at home. 'In a way I’m glad it was me, but it shouldn’t have been anyone.' Investigation: Asda says it is at a loss as to what could have caused the microwave meal to 'explode' and is carrying out an investigation into the incident . Mr Milis is urging Asda to remove the meal from sale but the company says it wants to hold an investigation and is 'at a loss' to what caused the incident. An Asda spokeswoman said: 'We take any complaints about our products really seriously - especially when it comes to their safety. 'We’re at a loss to understand what could have happened with Mr Milis’ ready meal and would really like to investigate it further. 'Unfortunately, we haven’t received the packaging back from him yet, but we’re speaking to him regularly in the hope we can resolve this as quickly as possible.'

"By . Hugo Gye . A secondary school teacher has been sacked after calling her own pupils 'feral' in a series of bizarre rants on social media. Lauren Rose, who brands herself a 'troublemaker', also called one child 'cowface' as she posted profanity-filled tweets complaining about her work. Fellow Twitter users warned her that the posts were 'unethical', and today her school announced that she had been fired over the 'totally unacceptable' messages. Fired: Lauren Rose has been sacked by Ifield Community College in Crawley over a series of tweets . Miss Rose was working as a supply teacher at Ifield Community College in Crawley, West Sussex when she posted the tweets. One of them read: 'Not sure I have the energy (or desire) to teach feral kids all day - The f*** is wrong with Crawley children?' Another stated: 'You wouldn't believe the cowface I taught yesterday - or didn't as she was swiftly kicked out of the class.' Miss Rose, who described herself as a 'subtly charming troublemaker' in her Twitter profile, also wrote: 'Douchey year 8 thinks this in an acceptable total amount of work to have produced in a whole 8 weeks.' When other web users complained that she was being 'unethical', the teacher replied: 'Then I'll deal with the consequences.' Profile: Miss Rose made her Twitter profile private after the controversial posts came to light . The school launched an investigation after one critic, Laura Fitch, contacted them to alert them to Miss Rose's tweets. She said the teacher was 'not setting a good example', adding that she was 'appalled' to see Miss Rose behaving so unprofessionally. This morning, acting headmaster Richard Cowper announced that the teacher had been sacked with immediate effect. 'We feel that the Twitter comments are totally unacceptable, bringing the college and the teaching profession into disrepute,' he said. 'As a result we have taken full and immediate disciplinary action.' Defiant: When other tweeters, complained, Miss Rose replied: 'I'll deal with the consequences' Earlier, he said: 'I would not expect a teacher to talk about their students, especially not in that way.' One parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'Teachers have to be so careful what they write on social media. 'One slip and you're in trouble, but to be honest if you call a pupil cowface and the rest of them feral you are hardly likely to keep your job for long.' Miss Rose refused to comment on the controversy, and made her Twitter profile private after the messages came to light. She told the Crawley News the kids at the school were 'lovely', adding: 'It's a good school and the staff do a great job.'","Lauren Rose was teaching at Ifield Community College in Crawley, Sussex .

"By . Suzannah Hills . The mother and stepfather of a seven-year-old boy who died three years ago have been arrested in connection with his suspected murder after police re-opened the case. Schoolboy Blake Fowler died from a brain haemorrhage after sustaining head injuries at a property in Southampton, Hampshire, in 2011. Police have now arrested Blake's mother Sarah Spacagna, her partner Peter Meek, and his brother Philip Meek, after re-opening the investigation into how the schoolboy died. And in an unprecedented move, Hampshire Constabulary today apologised for the initial investigation, which they described as 'unsatisfactory'. Tragedy: Blake Fowler was just seven-years-old when he died from a brain haemorrhage after sustaining severe head injuries in 2011 . The trio were questioned by detectives from Hampshire’s Major Investigation Team after officers swooped on addresses in Southampton on Tuesday morning. Ms Spacagna, 28, was arrested on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child. Both men were arrested on suspicion of murder and on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child. Hampshire police revealed the development is part of a fresh inquiry, named Operation Katla, after the case was reviewed by specialist officers. Scene: Blake was at a property in Cromarty Road, pictured, in Shirley, Southampton, when he sustained the injuries on December 3, 2011 . A spokesman said: 'Two men, aged 24 . and 25, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, and causing or . allowing the death of a child. 'A 28-year-old woman was arrested for causing or allowing the death of a child. 'They were arrested at addresses in Southampton, and have been taken into custody where they will be interviewed.' Blake was rushed to hospital after suffering head injuries at a house in Cromarty Road in Lordshill, Southampton, on December 3, 2011. He died from a brain haemorrhage at Southampton General Hospital the following day. Fatal injuries: Blake was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he died from a brain haemorrhage on December 4, 2011 . At the time he suffered his injuries, Blake was in the care of Peter and Philip Meek while his mother Sarah was out shopping. Both men were initially arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. A subsequent police investigation resulted in both of them being released with no further action being taken against them. December 3, 2011: Blake was rushed to hospital after suffering head injuries at a house in Cromarty Road in Lordshill, Southampton. At the time he sustained the injuries, he was said to have been in the care of Peter Meek and his brother Philip Meek while his mother Sarah Spacagna was out shopping. December 4, 2011: Blake dies from a brain haemorrhage at Southampton General Hospital. December 6, 2011: Police arrest Peter Meek and his brother Philip Meek on suspicion of causing grevious bodily harm but decide to release them without charge. The case file is never passed on to the Crown Prosecution service. November 2013: An inquest is held into Blake’s death. Coroner Keith Wiseman returns an open verdict and says there are still many unanswered questions over how he died. April 2, 2014: Hampshire police arrest Sarah Spacagna on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child. Peter Meek and his brother Philip Meek are also arrested on suspicion of murder and on suspicion of causing or allowing the death of a child. Police apologise for the original ‘unsatisfactory investigation’. However, . the decision not to proceed with any charges was taken by Hampshire . police officers, not the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). This . was because the file was never passed to the Crown Prosecution Service - . the body that decides whether there is enough evidence to pursue a . prosecution. Hampshire Constabulary today apologised after re-examining all lines of enquiry conducted during the initial probe. Assistant . Chief Constable Laura Nicholson said: 'I accept the initial . investigation by the constabulary was unsatisfactory and for that I . apologise. 'It was found that whilst there were performance issues relating to a number of officers there was no misconduct. 'I accept that the standard of performance was not what we would have wanted.' Coroner Keith Wiseman held an inquest in November last year to examine the circumstances of Blake’s death. But he returned an open verdict, after ruling there was no way of knowing for certain how Blake came to suffer the head injury that killed him. He did not hear any evidence from witnesses to the incident and said there were inconsistencies in the accounts given to police about what happened. It is believed the LSCB has been notified of the arrests and the publication of their findings will now be delayed until after the conclusion of any criminal proceedings.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A young mother has told how she feared for her life during a brutal attack by her ex boyfriend in which he gouged her eyes, repeatedly punched her in the face and almost bit her ear off. Emma Hunt, 22, had just dropped her three-year-old daughter off at a nursery in Nottingham when Martell Campbell, 24, launched a savage on her in front of horrified parents and children. The . 24-year-old leapt out of bushes and grabbed Miss Hunt in a bear hug in . the middle of the road. Savage attack: Emma Hunt (left) was punched and had her ear nearly bitten off by her ex boyfriend, Martell Campbell (right), who has been jailed for over six years as a result . He then punched her repeatedly in the face and dragged her on all . fours before throwing her down between two parked cars. He then gouged at her eyes and strangled her before trying to bite through her ear. Nottingham Crown Court sentenced Campbell to six and a half years in jail for the November 6 assault, after he admitted wounding. Ms Hunt, 22, had just dropped her three-year-old daughter off at nursery when Campbell, 24, attacked . Ms . Hunt, who was treated at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, . said: 'My ear was hanging off, I had a broken nose, my knees were grazed . and my face was bruised. 'I was in hospital all day and they had to sew the top part of my ear back on. 'I'm . glad he's locked up and can leave me alone. I think he should have been . jailed for longer though but didn't expect he would be. 'I . was worried I was going to die, I can't really remember much of the . attack but my only thoughts were that I wasn't going to see my daughter . again.' Ms Hunt revealed that Campbell had threatened to kill her the night before, but thought he was merely letting off steam. She . said: 'He said he was going to come to the school and kill me. I was . really shaken up but I didn't actually think he would attack me. I . thought he was sounding off. 'I was walking back from the school and someone said to me that a big black guy was hiding in the bushes. 'Then I saw him and that is when he pounced on me. He's a lot bigger and stronger than me, I was just trying to defend myself.' She first started dating Campbell six years ago but said he started getting 'weird' after the pair had a daughter together. They broke up after four years but Miss Hunt allowed Campbell to continue seeing his child who is now three years old. But she said Campbell suddenly changed in July last year and started stalking her and rummaging through her bins. She got a non-molestation order against him in October after Campbell hurled a brick through her window. The full-time mother said: 'It was okay at first when we broke up two years ago, he still had our daughter at weekends. Hospital treatment: Ms Hunt had to have her ear sewn back together after the vicious assault (left) and was left with badly grazed knees after being dragged along the floor by Campbell . Shock: The vicious assault took place outside Southwark Primary School in Nottingham in front of horrified children and parents . 'But when it got to July of last year he turned a bit weird and started harassing me and stalking me. 'He smashed my windows and was going through my bins and he used to ask people where I was. 'We had an argument on the phone the night before he attacked me because I wouldn't get back with him.' The court heard that Miss Hunt had warned staff at the school about him that morning, following his threats. Campbell . was serving a suspended prison sentence for assaulting another . ex-partner and had been issued a non-molestation order to stay away from . Ms Hunt three weeks before the attack. Campbell, . of Nottingham, was caught thanks to quick-thinking parents outside the . school - including one who followed him and snapped his picture on her . mobile phone. History: Ms Hunt said she first started dating Campbell six years ago but said he started getting 'weird' after the pair had a daughter together . Prosecutor Mark Achurch said that Ms Hunt suffered 'the worst pain she ever experienced' during the attack. Errol Ballentyne, defending, said Campbell accepted he had lost his temper. He added: ‘He hadn't set out for matters to end where they did end. He had hoped to be able to talk to the complainant.’ The sentence was also welcomed by Val Lunn, chief executive officer of Women's Aid Integrated Services in Nottingham. She said: ‘The severity of the sentence conveys a strong message that domestic violence will not be tolerated and perpetrators should expect to be held to account. ‘Women... have the right to live their lives free from the stress of violence.’","Emma Hunt was attacked by her ex outside a nursery school in Nottingham .

"By . James Rush . and Amanda Williams . John Garner was discovered last week off the coast of St Vincent floating in the water wearing a life jacket, around 200 feet away from his yacht . A British sailor found seriously injured close to his burning yacht in the Caribbean died from injuries consistent with an explosion, police have said. Officers on the island of St Vincent had launched a murder investigation following the death of John Garner, 53, and described his girlfriend as a 'person of interest'. However, following the results of the post-mortem they said they no longer wanted to question her, the Associated Press has reported. Mr Garner was discovered last week off the coast of St Vincent floating in the water wearing a life jacket, around 200 feet away from his yacht. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Police said he was alone on board the boat during the apparent explosion and that his Norwegian girlfriend had left the island a couple of days earlier. Sailing experts have said it is not uncommon for people to die from propane stove explosions. Diving instructor Kay Wilson who discovered Mr Garner, said there was so much black smoke that by the time she reached the stricken boat it had already been engulfed by flames. She said: 'It was almost razed to the water line, and the heat and the smoke which were coming were just incredible.' The vessel was 'almost underwater' and it looked like Mr Garner had tried to deploy his life raft but it did not deploy properly, she said. Ms Wilson added: 'Behind the boat there was debris in every direction and the wind was carrying the debris from the boat. 'I think it was an indication there had been an explosion on board because there was so much stuff in the water - garbage from the galley and small pieces of debris. 'We found him (Mr Garner) very close relatively to his yacht, probably about 150-200 feet downwind, floating in the water. A local TV station posted this picture believed to be of the yacht on fire off the coast of St Vincent . 'He was wearing a lifejacket that inflates when you hit the water. It had inflated and was holding him up.' Mr Garner is believed to have been spending time on the Grenadines island of Bequia with another family member and planned to make his way to Antigua. The yacht is reportedly named Asante and registered in Gibraltar. A . sailing friend in Norway, where Mr Garner has lived for many years, said . the grandfather was ultra-fit and previously worked as a . physical trainer for British special forces. The . friend said on Thursday: ‘It is very shocking news. He was a very nice . man. He loved his yacht, Asante, and he was meticulous about the way he . kept it. He had a military attitude towards things and was a strict . sailing instructor. Diving instructor Kay Wilson (pictured here on Skype) has said she believes Mr Garner's death was an accident . ‘He . is what you would call an English gentleman. He trained the special . forces in Britain, the SAS I believe, although he was a civilian and did . not have a rank.' The friend said they had previously spoken about the dangers of travelling to St Vincent. Mr Garner's yacht, Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the coast of St. Vincent . ‘Me . and John spoke about St Vincent many times. In the yachting society, St . Vincent is somewhere you sailed straight past and did not stop at. ‘It was not a safe place, it was a place to avoid. People were worried about thefts and robberies and rapes. ‘Boat . boys would try to help you to anchor, when you did not need help, and . then charge you money. You paid them because you feared they would come . back at night time. ‘I told John this but he would say that it was okay and that he did not have a problem with them.' On Wednesday, pictures emerged of the burning boat, with plumes of black smoke billowing out. The . yacht, called Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off . the beautiful coastal resort of Buccament, south-west of the island, . which boasts several five-star hotels. Mr Garner had previously advertised sailing trips around the British Virgin Islands for between £5,500 and £9,000. The . online advertisement offers a journey around a ‘beautiful area’ and . lessons in navigation, boat handling and overboard practice, among other . skills. It states: ‘The instructor of Asante, John Edward Garner is Norwegian / English and he is also the owner of the boat. The Asante was described as 'a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty' with four sleeping cabin . ‘Skipper . and instructor John at Asante is a graduate of the English Yachtmaster . system and Yachtmaster Ocean from England, and has sailed far.’ The boat is described as ‘a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty’ with four sleeping cabins. The course was described as suitable for beginners and adheres to ‘British Royal Yachting Association’s rules’.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Traveller Percy Smith, 43, of Ryedale Caravan Site in Yorkshire has been jailed after admitting drug dealing and money laundering . A drug-dealing traveller who claimed benefits while living a life of luxury on the back of his illegal trade has been sent to prison. Unemployed Percy Smith, 43, had a fleet of brand new vehicles worth £77,000, £2,500 cash, large deposits in the bank and lived what police called an 'indulgent' lifestyle when he was arrested at the caravan site he lived on in Yorkshire. Officers raided three caravans and seized a Audi A3 S-Line, a Ford Fiesta Zetec S, a Ford Focus ST-2 and a Ford Transit van, which would have cost £9,000 a year alone to insure. They also found evidence of cannabis cultivation, £3,000-worth of heroin, split into smaller quantities, and £2,500 in cash which Smith was unable to explain. Smith was jailed at York Crown Court for three years and nine months after admitting conspiracy to supply cannabis and heroin, and one charge of money laundering. He now faces a proceeds of crime hearing. The court heard that police raided Smith's home at Ryedale Caravan Site on the outskirts of York for the first time in June 2011, when they found evidence of cannabis farming as well as £5,805 cash. While Smith's only official income was state benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance, officers also discovered that large amounts of cash were being deposited in his bank accounts and those of close relatives. Further searches uncovered 67.5grams of heroin with a street value of £3,000, four new vehicles, £2,514 cash, and receipts for luxury items including three crystal wine glasses which Smith had bought for £700, and an array of Apple devices including iPhones, iPods and an iPad, all of which had been paid for in cash. Officers, who also found £1,800 proceeds of crime at another caravan belonging to an associate of Smith's, said he clearly had an 'indulgent' lifestyle way beyond his means. Smith was sentenced yesterday and a proceeds of crime hearing will take place in October. Richard John . Miner, 47, from London, was given a 12-month jail term, suspended for . two years, for his part in the illegal set-up. This brand new Audi A3 S-line was found at Smith's caravan when police executed a search warrant there . Seized: This new Ford Focus car was taken by officers during one of several raids on his home in Yorkshire . Another one: Officers who took this brand new Ford Fiesta said that Smith lived way beyond his (official) means . And another one: This Ford Transit van was taken from the traveller's home, one of his brand new, £77,000 fleet . Acting Sgt Toby Gorwood of North Yorkshire Police said: 'Percy Smith was well supported by the state but undertook criminal activities over a significant period of time with the sole aim of financing a materialistic and self-indulgent lifestyle he could not otherwise afford. 'He selfishly fuelled drug abuse in York and the associated criminality which comes with it. This is something which is abhorrent to law abiding people who work hard for their living.' Det Con Adam Heatlie who led the drugs investigation, said: 'Organised and coordinated crime of this nature will not be tolerated within the communities.'","Percy Smith, 43, was unemployed and claiming Jobseeker's Allowance .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband is trying to hire an expert in broadcasting to stop him looking ‘weird’ on TV. The Labour party is recruiting a senior adviser to bring ‘fresh ideas’ to overhauling the leader’s image. In addition to having ideas about how to improve Mr Miliband’s ‘brand strengths’, the successful candidate will also need to have experience of dealing with ‘bad news stories’. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband is hiring a new TV adviser to improve his image and deal with bad news stories . The new aide will be tasked with changing Mr Miliband's image in the run-up to the 2015 general election . While Labour has maintained a lead in the polls, Mr Miliband’s personal ratings have remained poor. A YouGov survey last week showed 41 per cent of people think the Labour leader is ‘weird’ or ‘very weird’. The survey for BuzzFeed, which looked at the public’s perception of the leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school. With some opinion polls putting Labour’s lead over the Tories at just one point, Mr Miliband has ordered his team to beef up his media operation. The Labour website is advertising the new role of Head of the Leader’s Broadcasting, to be based in the Leader of the Opposition’s Office. The new job comes with a £44,244.40 salary, and a ‘fixed sum allowance’ of £971. The contract will last only until a month after the general election, due in May 2015. Some 41 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband is 'weird', compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of David Cameron . Photo ops: Mr Miliband has been seen taking the tube and visiting flood-hit areas, where water sloshed over his wellies . The new recruit will be tasked with boosting coverage of the Labour leader and making the most of his ‘brand strengths’. The job involves ‘overseeing the broadcast output and visual images of the Leader of the Opposition’ and advising Mr Miliband on ‘broadcast performance and helping him prepare for clips/interviews/visits’. It follows concern that his clips to the cameras have been repetitive. In one interview in 2011 he repeatedly told unions and ministers embroiled in strike threats to ‘set aside the rhetoric’ and ‘get around the negotiating table to stop this happening again’. The new adviser will also be tasked with improving relations with the main broadcasters in the run up to the election. It includes: ‘Developing fresh ideas for making the best of Leader of Opposition's brand strengths and communicating his message in broadcast medium.’ According to the advert essential experience for the winning candidate includes ‘experience of working with senior politicians’ and ‘experience of dealing with good and bad news stories’. While Mr Miliband's current media team is dominated by former newspaper journalists, Mr Cameron's communications chief, Craig Oliver, is a former BBC executive.","Labour party advertises for new Head of the Leader’s Broadcasting .

Shocking images show a gang of robbers attacking a father with a crowbar after bursting into his home in Birmingham . The gang threatened the man's son and demanded money and valuables from the family home . The father, who has not been named by police, then stepped in to try and protect his son. But the gang lashed out at the man with the crowbar, striking him across the knuckles. Luckily however, he was not serious injured. The thieves then made off with an iPod and jewellery including four gold bangles, a gold diamond ring and leaf-effect gold earrings. CCTV images show some of the robbers dressed in light-coloured hoodies with the drawstrings pulled tight beneath their faces. The gang member armed with a crowbar also wore a mask. Images show one of the group, a man in glasses, was not wearing a hood, and his face can be clearly seen beneath his baseball cap.

"By . Hugo Gye . There are nearly as many Chinese students doing masters degrees in England as there are British students, it emerged today. In total, three quarters of all masters students at English universities are foreign, according to figures from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. However, the proportion of overseas student fell between 2010 and 2013 thanks to rising fees and tough new visa restrictions - the first fall in numbers for three decades. Students: There are nearly as many Chinese as British people doing full-time masters degrees (file photo) The number of full-time postgraduate students from China studying in England last year was 28,390 - up nine per cent on the year before. Out of all students doing full-time taught masters degrees at an English university, 23 per cent were Chinese, compared to 26 per cent who were from the UK. Chinese students were most dominant in maths and media studies, making up more than half the total foreign intake, with high numbers in business, engineering and architecture. The proportion of Chinese students was boosted by a decline of around 50 per cent in the numbers coming from countries such as India and Pakistan. South Asian students traditionally favoured British universities thanks to cultural ties, but a tougher visa regime and a ban on students working in the UK after graduation is believed to have driven them away. Decline: The overall number of foreign postgraduate students has fallen for the first time in three decades . The overall number of postgraduates in England from outside the EU was 71,260, down from a peak of 72,245 in 2010-11. By contrast, other countries including the U.S. saw a rise in people coming to study, apparently benefiting from students shunning the UK. In addition, the number of undergraduate students coming from the EU fell by a quarter in 2012-13, apparently thanks to increased tuition fees of up to £9,000 a year. While EU citizens are not required to obtain a visa to study at English universities, they must pay the same fees as students from the UK, meaning the hike in prices has put them off. British students still dominate undergraduate courses, with 83 per cent of the total, while around half of those studying research-based masters degrees are from the UK. Graduation: British students are still predominant in undergraduate and research masters degrees . The University and College Union blamed Government rhetoric on immigration for damaging Britain's international reputation as a leading destination for education. 'International students make a huge contribution to academic and cultural life on campuses and in our cities,' said general secretary Sally Hunt. 'They also make a valuable contribution to our economy. As we face continued uncertainty about the future of funding for our universities, the Government should be doing more to encourage foreign students. 'Ministers need to recognise that attempts to sound tough on immigration at home are also reported elsewhere and it is not surprising if students consider studying in the countries that make an effort to welcome them.' Professor Madeleine Atkins, chief executive of the HEFCE, said: 'This new analysis from HEFCE expands our understanding of global demand for English higher education. 'International students enrich our universities and colleges - and our society - academically, culturally, and through their contribution to the economy. 'Supporting high-quality international education is a crucial part of ensuring that the UK continues to engage with, and benefit from, the increasingly interconnected world.'","23% of students doing full-time taught masters degrees in England are Chinese, with 26% from the UK .

"By . Richard Spillett . A three-bedroom bungalow on a Thames island once awarded to Admiral Nelson is going up for sale for £700,000. The small isle is known as 'Pharaoh's Island' after it was given to the famous naval commander to celebrate his victory in the Battle of Nile . The bungalow, named Pyramid after the battle's Egyptian setting, has a riverside lounge, luxury kitchen, two bathrooms and within the grounds are two summer houses. The three-bedroom bungalow, called Pyramid, on Pharaoh's Island near Shepperton Lock, Surrey, is up for sale for £700,000 . The property has a garden overlooking the river, where Admiral Nelson - who was given the island to honour his victories - used to fish . The only problem for a potential owner however is that the house is only accessible by boat. Many residents of the island have their own private boats but there are also communal rowing boats to get to shore. The bungalow features a stunning river garden on the water’s edge, where Nelson used to fish, but which has now modernized with a raised Jacuzzi hot tub. Pharaoh’s Island is on the Thames just upstream from Shepperton Lock, Surrey and the bungalow, named Pyramid, is one of 24 houses on the island. The isle was one of many honours Admiral Nelson received after winning the Battle of the Nile in 1798 - and each house has an Egyptian name. After reaching the island by a short boat trip, there is a central pathway leading through the wildlife haven to a large green used for various events in the island's social calendar. Admiral Nelson, pictured in the painting by Lemuel Francis Abbott, was given the island after his victory in the Battle of the Nile, and he used to fish in Thames . As well as being private because of its boat-only access, the house boasts a 31-foot riverside lounge, seperate guest accomodation, Jacuzzi hot-tub and a 61-foot deep water mooring . Estate agents say the property offers great views of the Thames, and the area where Nelson used to fish has now been modernised with a hot-tub . The house - named Pyramid - is one of 24 on the island, which all have names linked to Egypt in honour of Nelson's battle . Estate agent Robert King, who also lives on the island, said: 'It's a unique property and really a way of life for any prospective buyer. 'The island community is very close, it's not just a wave as you go past, it's ""how are you? Can we help you?"" 'Lots of residents on the island have their own boats, but there are also ferry boats which you can row across yourself. 'It's also very handy for day trips out of the Thames in both directions and obviously we have had a lot of interest because of the history of the island.' The Battle of the Nile was fought between the British and French navies at Aboukir Bay off the coast of the Egypt in August 1798. The British fleet, commanded by Nelson, had been pursuing the French fleet, under Admiral Paul D'Brueys, across the Mediterranean as French general Napolean Bonaparte sought to invade Egypt to constrict British trade routes to India. The fighting was ferocious and Nelson himself was hit in the forehead, but with a fleet of just fourteen ships, he managed to capture six French vessels and destroyed another seven out of a total of seventeen. The British suffered 218 killed and 677 wounded but French losses were far worse, with an estimated 5225 men killed, wounded and captured. The victory meant Napoleon's army in Egypt was cut off and forced to surrender by a British force in 1801. The battle has since been immortalised in a number of famous paintings, including the 1825 masterpiece by Mather Brown, pictured.","The exclusive property is on an island once given to Nelson to honour his victory in the Battle of the Nile in 1978 .

"By . James Slack . A study predicts net migration from inside Europe will be 130,000 every year if current trends continue. Pictured, Romanian passengers aboard a bus, leaving Bucharest, to take them to the United Kingdom in January . Immigration from the EU will add the equivalent of a city as big as Manchester to the UK’s population every four years, a report warns today. The study predicts net migration from inside Europe will be 130,000 every year if current trends continue. This total includes 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians and 40,000 from Poland and the seven other Eastern European nations which joined the EU in 2004. On January 1, Britain lifted all restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK. No figures are yet available for how many have arrived since that date. However, in the year to September 2013 there were 24,000 arrivals and around 140,000 were already working in the UK at the start of the year. The remainder of the predicted migrants are expected to come from the so-called ‘old’ EU – including large numbers from Greece, Spain and Italy fleeing the eurozone disaster. Experts say that within years EU immigration could overtake that from the rest of the world as the main source of arrivals to Britain. MigrationWatch compiled the figures from official Government sources. The campaign group said one of the major pull factors to the UK was the generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits. A migrant with no dependants earning the minimum wage has their net income of around £184 a week boosted to £254 by tax credits and housing benefit. In effect, State support makes up 28 per cent of their final take-home pay of £13,218 a year. Immigration from the EU will add the equivalent of a city as big as Manchester (pictured) to the UK¿s population every four years . If the migrant has a partner and two children, the net weekly income rockets from £184 to £543. State handouts constitute 66 per cent of a total annual income of £28,241. MigrationWatch said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in-work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here. Under the current regime, a single worker on the minimum wage in the UK would be able to earn four-and-a-half times the income they could earn in Romania – or nine times as much for a family. Any attempt to treat EU migrants differently to British citizens, who receive the same level of tax credits and other benefits, would spark a huge row with Brussels. The European Commission is already dragging Westminster to court over the so-called ‘right to reside’ test. But the UK may hope to secure an ally in Germany, which last week signalled its own intention to take a tougher line on EU immigration. MigrationWatch said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in-work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here . Last night, Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘The good news is that immigration from outside the EU is coming down steadily as the Government has promised. The bad news is that migrants from the EU have driven the policy off course. ‘It was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to 100million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own. ‘There must now be a determined renegotiation.’ To date, Government efforts to control EU immigration have focused on access to out-of-work benefits, such as Jobseeker’s Allowance. But the MigrationWatch study points out that migrants from the EU have one of the highest employment rates of all groups in the UK. Some 79 per cent of Eastern European migrants – known as EU8 or A8 workers – are in employment, compared to 71 per cent of the UK population as a whole. However, the report states: ‘This should not be used as an indication of the extent to which they are actually able to maintain themselves and their families in  the UK. ‘EU8 migrants have on average lower wages, many are employed at no more than minimum wage and many declare themselves self-employed with little evidence of income at even minimum- wage levels. ‘At this level, both employees and self-employed are heavily subsidised by the taxpayer through in-work benefits and tax credits.’ Earlier this year, the Tories were dealt a huge blow by figures showing total net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the UK and  those leaving – had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013. It was driven entirely by a 40 per cent leap in the number of people taking advantage of EU edicts on free movement.The shock increase left Downing Street unable to say if David Cameron would meet his key election promise to slash net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by 2015. MigrationWatch said that, based on current trends, non-EU net migration could fall to just 100,000 and be taken over by arrivals from the EU as the main source of  net migration. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘Our reforms have cut non-EU migration to its lowest level since 1998 and there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU than when this government came to power. ‘We are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and ensuring that controls on benefits and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe. ‘But as long as there are huge economic disparities in the EU, there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move. ‘In future, we must slow full access to labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration – for example, by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed.’","Net migration from inside Europe will hit '130,000 every year'

"By . Luke Garratt . Italian footballer and father-of-three Antonio Floro Flores has pledged to adopt a three-day-old baby who was found abandoned on a train. Flores decided to adopt the child after hearing how the baby boy had been left in a railway car, and contacted authorities to see if he could provide the child a home. The baby boy, aged between around three or four days old, was found with its umbilical . cord still attached, under the seat of a train in southern . Italy last week. Antonio Floro Flores has declared that he will adopt the child, having been touched by his tragic story of abandonment in the news . The child was found wrapped in a shawl and a pajama top, and placed inside a shopping bag, in the last carriage of a train which was headed towards Baiano from Naples. When the conductor of the train found him, he was taken to Moscati hospital in Avellino, where the staff of the hospital named him Francesco. Despite the circumstances of his abandonment, doctors have said the child is healthy, weighing 2.5 kilos, and tests show he was breast-fed shortly before being abandoned. Since he was abandoned, footballer Floro Flores was struck by the story, and decided to take the child under his wing, announcing his and his wife's intention on Twitter. He said: 'After seeing little Francesco, we followed what our heart dictated. 'I am . a father before being a soccer player, but certainly not a hero!' Floro Flores and his wife are making sure the child is being adopted through the proper procedures, and is working with authorities to do so. Before he began the adoption process, the authorities had tried to contact the parents of the child. They also attempted to search CCTV on the Metrostat Circumvesuviana train to see if they could identify the parents, but have so far been unsuccessful. The conductor of the train, Antonio, said: 'Over . the course of my career on the trains Iâ€™ve found everything, from . mobile phones to fish in shopping bags. 'Who would have thought that one day I would find a baby.'","Child was found abandoned on a train - umbilical chord still attached .

"By . Andrew Levy . It is a sight not seen in Britain for six centuries. The last time storks bred in the wild here was in Edinburgh in 1416, when the Hundred Years War was raging and Henry V had just defeated the French at Agincourt. These four-year-old birds have built their huge nest on an 18th-century chimney at Thrigby Hall Wildlife Gardens near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Making history: The four-year-old storks have built their nest on a chimney near Great Yarmouth in Norfolk . They have been spotted mating and experts believe the female could lay her eggs within the next few days. Estate director Ken Sims said: ‘The building of a nest together is part of their courtship display and an indication that eggs are on their way. ‘They were seen copulating around five days ago and we think they were doing it a couple of days either side as well. ‘We . are pretty confident we will get some young storks. It could be that . eggs have been laid already but we can’t see as the chimney is too . high.’ Sighting: They have been spotted mating and experts believe the female could lay her eggs in the next few days . Mid-flight: The last time storks bred in the wild in Britain was in 1416. Above, one of the storks collects material . Storks usually breed in the warmer parts of Continental Europe and spend their winters in Africa. Some occasionally visit the UK in Spring but only around 20 are spotted each year. The birds have been bred in zoos here but their wings are pinioned to stop them flying away, which also prevents them building nests in the lofty positions they prefer - often on man-made structures such as rooftops and telegraph poles. The pair in Great Yarmouth were bred in captivity in Cumbria and the Cotswolds and were bought as chicks by Mr Sims, who has a policy of not clipping their wings to allow them more freedom. He added: ‘They are resident at the wildlife gardens but they can fly and they are allowed their semi-liberty. ‘They go off into the countryside and the Norfolk Broads to feed and they come back here. We gave the storks a helping hand by building a structure for their nest on the hall’s front chimney. 'But they turned their backs on our handiwork and have built their own nest on one of the rear stacks. ‘We attempted to encourage stork breeding in 2008 but sadly the hen disappeared and the male stork flew into a power line and died. ‘We are hoping for more success this time. It will be a day for celebration if our storks manage to breed successfully in the traditional way.’ RSPB spokesman Richard James said he was looking forward to the prospect of the birds producing chicks, although he was still waiting for a pair born in the wild to mate. He added: ‘Storks visit the UK quite regularly although only a handful come every year. ‘The main reason that they have not bred here for hundreds of years is that there are never enough for them to pair up.’","Four-year-old birds built nest on chimney near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk .

"By . Ben Griffiths At Eglin Air Base, Florida . These photos show how British pilots are putting a £100million fighter jet through its paces ahead of its first appearance in British skies this summer. The first of the UK's F-35s – dubbed the Lightning II by maker Lockheed Martin – are at a . giant military airfield in Florida’s Panhandle region, where pilots are practicing flying them backwards, stopping them in mid-air and reaching top speeds of 1.6 times the speed of sound. The Daily Mail was invited for an . exclusive, behind-the-scenes visit at the Eglin Air Force Base to find out how the first three . British flyers and their 13 engineers are learning how to operate the . F-35, which is recognisable by its sharp-angled design and special . coating which makes it hard for enemy radars to detect. Flying into the future: A pilot sits in the cockpit of the new F-35 combat aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Its first British appearance is expected this summer . Futuristic: The model is designed to take-off and land vertically like its predecessor, the Harrier jump jet - but can also fly backwards for the first time . The Ministry of Defence and . manufacturers are negotiating its first British appearance, where it is . set to fly as part of the Farnborough air show in Hampshire and the . Royal International Air Tattoo in Gloucestershire. Although a US Air Force base, Eglin in Florida also hosts a detachment of British servicemen who are learning to fly and maintain the ‘B’ version of the F-35, 138 of which are destined for the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. This model is designed to take off and land vertically, like the Harrier jump jet, but can also fly backwards and land on the deck of aircraft carriers, including the two new Queen Elizabeth class ships being built for Britain’s Royal Navy. It can fly at Mach 1.6 – faster than the speed of sound – and has a range of more than 1,000 miles. Three of the F-35Bs at Eglin are already on the UK’s military aircraft register and have to be flown according to British rules and regulations. British flyers and maintainers from both the RAF and Royal Navy are already embedded with the US Marines’ VMFAT-501 Squadron at Eglin. Facts and figures: The new aircraft has been criticised for its £100m per jet cost, but it is also set to be the most advanced ever flown by the Royal Air Force . Revving up: The jet in test flights over the U.S. in 2011. It is set to come into service in Britain from 2018 and will be first be used by 617 Squadron - the Dambusters . In scenes reminiscent of the 1980s movie Top Gun, Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Ian Tidball, 44, is one of the British aces putting an F-35 through its paces. The former Sea Harrier pilot from Somerset, who has also flown the Boeing F/A-18 fighter bomber on exchange posting, describes the F-35 as a ‘step change’ from the other aircraft he has piloted. It can stop in mid-air and fly backwards at up to 30 knots . Uses radar-absorbent paint applied with micro-level accuracy using lasers for stealth missions . Airspeed, heading, altitude and targets are all projected on to the visor of the pilot's helmet instead of a display in the cockpit . ‘Each has been incrementally challenging and capable. But the F-35 flight control system is very good,’ he said. ‘It really does make flying the aeroplane very easy. While the Sea Harrier was very good, it was a stick and rudder aircraft and a lot of time was spent just flying the aeroplane.’ When hovering, the F-35B’s engine swivels round to direct thrust downwards and a hinged flap on top of the aircraft lifts up, similar doors opening on the underside, to direct the blast from its unique Rolls-Royce lift fan. The F-35 effectively sits on two columns of air as it is suspended like the Cold War-era Harrier. Unlike the Harrier, which needed the pilot to juggle three cockpit controls to keep it steady in the hover, the F-35’s computerised flight controls allow the jet to be manipulated using just the throttle and joystick. Tidball says: ‘With the F-35 there’s more time to operate the mission systems and there is a vast array of capability. The stealth capability is the other huge asset.’ Inside the cockpit is dominated by a giant flat screen that is touch-sensitive, making it intuitive to use for the iPad generation of pilots who will eventually go on to fly the aircraft in combat zones around the world. Many of the functions can also be activated by the pilot’s voice. The F-35’s stealth or ‘low observable’ nature comes both from its sharp angled design and the special coatings on its body that help it to almost disappear from enemy radar screens. Another hi-tech feature is the inclusion of six miniature cameras which look outside the aircraft and can check for threats like enemy missiles. Feat of engineering: The jet is introduced by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in 2012. The RAF says it will be by the far the most advanced it has ever flown . Sunrise on a new era: The jets can take off and land vertically and even fly backwards - but our reporter found a simulator remarkably easy to use . Night flying: The jet is equipped with advanced cameras which allows it to fly at supersonic speeds and carry out complex missions in total darkness . Precision: The jet is so well-engineered that it takes away some of the pure joy of flying - or in layman's terms, flying by the seat of one's pants . The information these cameras gather can be projected inside the visor of the pilot’s helmet or beamed to other jets in the formation, or commanders on the ground. The helmet also allows the pilot to see ‘through’ the aircraft’s structure to the ground below. The one downside of all this technology is that pilots joke it removes some of the fun of pure handling skills – in aviation parlance, flying by the seat of your pants. Thanks to some top flight instruction from Lockheed Martin’s test pilots I was able to sample the F-35 simulator for myself at the US defence giant’s Fort Worth factory. Anyone used to operating an iPad or similar tablet would instantly feel at home in the cockpit. The massive touch screen display controls everything from radar and cameras to engine instruments. Falling to hand are a massive joystick and throttle, each covered in dozens of buttons to handle every aspect of flight, ensuring the pilot barely need move his hands from the controls. Inside the helmet information on altitude, heading and speed is projected, along with symbols to show enemy aircraft and missiles. It really was easy to fly the F-35 thanks to a single button control which puts it into the classic Harrier-style hover. And flying aerobatics in the stealth fighter felt just like playing a computer game – without the G forces that pilots in the real jet experience, of course. Ben Griffiths . Group Captain Willy Hackett, a veteran . combat pilot who is the UK’s national deputy in the F-35 Joint Program . Office, says: ‘I would have a large smile on my face to see the F-35 on . the ramp as I walked out to the aircraft. It has to instil confidence in . the pilot.’ He adds: ‘Our . F-35 pilots will be some of our best educated people on the battlefield. The future F-35 pilots will be very much more systems operators and . tacticians now, controlling the inflow of information. The actual flying . is second nature.’ On . arriving at Eglin, the British personnel complete in-depth academic . courses and train in simulators before going on to an introductory . 10-hour course to get them used to the F-35. As there is no two-seater . jet, unlike previous generations of aircraft, the first time they take . off in the aircraft will be the first time they fly it for real. They then practice take-offs and landings and flying in formation with other aircraft before moving on to air-to-air fighting and attacking ground targets. There is an equally steep learning curve for the engineers and technicians on F-35. Sergeant Ken Dorfard, one of the maintainers hand-picked to be the first to go through F-35 training, explains the stealth aircraft has some unique challenges for his people, who must maintain its complex systems. Dorfard, who joined the RAF in 1991, says: ‘We have special shoes to walk on the aircraft so we don’t damage the surface. The stuff behind the panels is easier to work on thanks to computerisation, but it is harder to access. It’s not that different to a fourth generation jet like the Tornado or Harrier. In some ways the electronic testing takes the fun out of it.’ One of the biggest differences between F-35 and previous fighters is the sheer scale of the computer programming involved. Some eight million lines of computer coding is involved and much of the aircraft’s capabilities depend on this technology being completed on time and working. ‘It is a challenging aspect of the programme,’ says Lockheed Martin’s Mike Rein. The aircraft’s software will be continually updated during its 50-plus year lifespan. Once the development work is completed Britain could buy fewer than the 138 aircraft it originally signed up for. With a price tag of up to £100m per jet, the F-35 has attracted some controversy at a time of widespread cuts in defence spending. But the RAF and Royal Navy are adamant it will be a game-changing aeroplane that will increase British forces’ capabilities on the future battlefield. The RAF’s famous 617 Squadron – the Dambusters – will be the first British unit to get the F-35 and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk from 2018. The squadron was temporarily stood down at the end of March when its Tornado bombers were retired. Testing: An F-35 aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier last summer.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A luxury yacht was reduced to a burnt-out husk after its engine overheated and caught fire while it was moored in a marina. The £100,000, 36ft Jeanneau Sun Odyssey, called Fortyniner, was surrounded by yachts and powerboats worth millions of pounds when it went up in flames at Mercury Yacht Harbour in Hamble, Hampshire. Firefighters were called but were too late to save the cruising yacht, which exploded when flames reached the onboard gas bottles. Scroll down for video . Inferno: Smoke and five-foot flames billow from the £1million Jeanneau 36i yacht as it was moored in Hamble . Thick black smoke choked the air above the marina after the yacht's engine overheated and caught fire . Flames: The fire engulfed the yacht, called Fortyniner, within minutes, destroying its boom and mast . Harbour workers raced to move other vessels moored near the burning yacht, including a £1m Sunseeker . The yacht's mast snapped and toppled into the marina, and the explosion sent boat parts flying into the air as five-metre flames roared through the vessel, which had no-one on board at the time. Harbour workers fought to control the blaze before racing to move expensive ships moored nearby, including a 70ft Sunseeker powerboat worth £1million. Dock master Dave Wright said it sounded 'like a bomb going off' as the yacht, which is owned by Hamble School of Yachting, exploded on Monday lunchtime. And once firefighters had brought the fire under control, they had to pump water out of the gutted boat to prevent it sinking. The eight-berth yacht is rented out by the Hamble School of Yachting for up to £1,450 a week. On the school's website it is described as 'a cruising yacht built for comfort and designed for those looking for a relaxed way of getting away from it all'. Similar sailing boats cost upwards of £1million, depending on extras and the quality of finish. Burnt out: The yacht, which was rented out for up to £1,450 a week to holidaymakers, is now ruined . After the fire was quenched, emergency workers had to pump water out to stop the yacht sinking . The vessel burned in a Hampshire marina where it was surrounded by yachts worth up to £1million each . The yachting school principal, Rob Gaffney, said: 'It's quite emotional. We're a small company, and it's much like if your house catches fire; it's soul destroying.' The blaze was the second yacht fire within four hours in Hamble.  Fire crews had earlier tackled flames onboard a 49ft moored vessel which is thought to have caught fire as a result of an electrical fault. A Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service . spokesman said the fire was caused by an engine that overheated.

"By . Ian Drury . With a handshake and a smile, Britain's leading combat role in Afghanistan ended yesterday. The headquarters of Task Force Helmand ceased operations after 13 years of bloody fighting and the loss of nearly 450 lives. Five thousand UK troops will remain in the war zone – but only until December and under US command. Scroll down for video . Handover: Brigadier James Woodham (pictured right) handed over control to his American counterpart Brigadier General Daniel Yoo (pictured left) UK Brigadier James Woodham sealed the handover by shaking hands with US Brigadier General Daniel Yoo, who said Britain's sacrifice would go down in 'the annals of military history'. Senior commanders say the Afghan army and police forces are increasingly able to maintain security. But they warn that the threat of casualties will endure until the last soldier leaves. National elections on Saturday provide the first flashpoint. Four hundred troops representing every unit in the task force attended the Camp Bastion ceremony, staged in front of a monument bearing 16 plaques – one for each brigade to fight there. Padre Steve Whiting said: 'From the poppy fields of Ypres to those of Helmand province, our bravest and best have borne the cost of freedom for others.' Brigadier Woodham, who commands 7 Armoured Brigade – the Desert Rats – said Britain should feel proud of its troops despite the mission's painful losses.

'They have served long and hard, demonstrated their professionalism, shown real commitment through some dark days. They have delivered the mission and given the Afghans a chance,' he said. He said the military campaign had faced down Al Qaeda, trained 350,000 Afghan soldiers and policemen and set up schools and health centres. Task Force Helmand was formed in 2006 when 3,000 servicemen were sent by Tony Blair to Helmand, a volatile Taliban hotbed in the south of Afghanistan.

The then defence secretary John Reid said he hoped 'not a shot would be fired' in what was expected to be a three-year campaign. But violence spiralled and hundreds of troops have been killed by bullets and roadside bombs. The war has claimed 448 UK lives. A few hundred soldiers will remain on standby to carry out strike operations if requested by the Afghans. Packing up: British soldiers on their way out of Helmand province . The . rest will focus on packing up kit ahead of the return home. Leaving . Afghanistan is considered the biggest logistical exercise for UK forces . since the Second World War. Commanders have the job of bringing home 3,400 vehicles and 5,000 shipping containers worth of kit on a journey of 8,000 miles. A committee in the UK decides what is saved and what should be scrapped or gifted to the Afghans. So far, 1,753 vehicles and the equivalent of 2,750 containers have been returned. Brigadier Martin Moore, of the UK's Joint Forces Support, said the £300 million redeployment operation was carefully thought out. He added: 'We have got to get the balance right between taking equipment and recovering capability and leaving sufficient kit for fighters to do the job on the ground. We have to ensure we get out of here in good order with everybody alive.' He said Camp Bastion would take on the 'expeditionary posture' of a military checkpoint. Human rights legislation will stop soldiers fighting properly because they fear being sued, MPs will warn today. They will say an unprecedented number of legal challenges is jeopardising the effectiveness of the armed forces. The report of the Commons defence committee condemns the 'judicialisation' of warfare and warns of higher civilian casualties as risk-adverse commanders call in airstrikes instead of putting troops in the line of fire. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured right) responded to the findings by signalling last night that the Government is prepared to change the law to give soldiers more protection from the courts. The European Convention on Human Rights allows foreign nationals – such as detainees held by British forces – to make frequently spurious claims in the UK courts. Last month allegations that British troops executed Iraqis in cold blood were dropped only after a year-long inquiry costing £22million. The MPs say this leaves servicemen vulnerable to 'almost unlimited potential for retrospective claims against them' and has led many to question whether they want to stay in uniform. They also warn that a Supreme Court decision last year to let families of dead servicemen sue the Ministry of Defence for negligence has also undermined operational effectiveness. The committee said: 'This seems to us to risk the judicialisation of war and to be incompatible with the accepted contract entered into by service personnel and the nature of soldiering.'","UK Brigadier James Woodham shook hands with US officer .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Doctors, dentists, nurses and midwives who can't speak English well enough may be struck off under new draft legislation published today. Health regulators in charge of the UK's 1.4million health workers will for the first time be given powers to bar professionals simply because their command of the English language is considered so poor as to 'impair their fitness to practise'. The Law Commission's new draft Bill covers nine bodies ranging from the General Medical Council (GMC) to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).  Social workers in England will also be covered. Care: Doctors and dentists may be struck off if their English is poor under new draft legislation published today . The Regulation of Health and Social Care Professionals bill has been drafted to improve safety for patients who might be at risk when under the care of a health professional who can't communicate with them properly. The 2008 case of German doctor, Daniel Ubani, who accidentally killed Cambridge patient David Gray, 70, when he confused two drugs and gave him ten times the recommended dose of diamorphine, highlights the risks of doctors with poor English working in the UK. Currently the nine bodies, which also cover chiropractors, osteopaths, opticians, and pharmacists, are bound by different rules on what they can do to govern health workers with poor English. At the moment, some can only investigate once they have received a formal complaint, and others can only investigate if the medic with poor English is suspected of having made a mistake already. The NMC has loose guidelines which put the onus on checking the professional's English with the employer, and are not able to strike them off simply because of the language issue.  Meanwhile the GMC can only check the language skills of workers if they are from outside the EU.  The regulations for the GMC, however, will change later this year when new rules come in to force allowing the testing of medics' language skills before they can work. Today's new draft Bill states: 'We want the regulators to have powers to investigate concerns relating to a professional’s knowledge of English before specific instances of deficient performance occur. Midwives will also be governed by the new legislation which covers 32 health professions (file picture) 'This new ground should include, for example, inability or likely inability to communicate a diagnosis or advice to patients and service users, or an inability to read dosage levels when administering medication.' The sanctions regulators can impose will be extended and, for the first time, they will be able to discipline or strike off professionals who are not able to communicate clearly in English. The Bill also allows regulators to reconsider cases that have been closed following a mistake or error, as recommended by the inquiry into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust. A process of revalidation, where professionals undergo 'MOTs' to ensure they are still fit to practise, will be extended from doctors to all health and social care professionals. German doctor Daniel Ubani, pictured, gave an English patient a massive and fatal dose of diamorphine after confusing two drugs . Schemes could also be introduced to bar unregulated workers from providing services, according to the UK-wide recommendations. Nicholas Paines QC, the commissioner leading the project for England and Wales, said: 'The professional regulators of the health and social care field operate within a wide variety of legal frameworks that have been agreed and amended by Parliament in different ways, at different times, over the past 150 years. 'Our recommended reforms place patient protection firmly at the heart of a new legal framework. 'If implemented, they will enhance the autonomy of the regulators, empower them to respond more quickly and effectively to emerging public health concerns and enable them to meet the demands of a modern, devolved health and social care sector.' A joint letter signed by the regulators calls on the Government to support the new plans and asks for 'urgent parliamentary consideration' of the Bill. It said: 'The recommendations of Robert Francis QC following events in Mid Staffordshire highlighted the vital importance of effective regulation focused on promoting safe, compassionate patient care rather than, as too often in the past, intervening only after patients have suffered harm.' Jackie Smith, head of the NMC, said: 'I would strongly urge the Government to include this Bill in the timetable for the last parliamentary session. 'Without it the NMC cannot modernise its “outdated and inflexible” decision making processes.' In 2008, 70-year-old David Gray died after he was given a fatal dose of diamorphine by German out-of-hours locum, Daniel Ubani. Ubani was working on his first shift in Cambridge when he saw Mr Gray, who was suffering from kidney stones.  He gave Mr Gray ten times the correct amount of painkiller after confusing two drugs. That same year, it emerged that foreign doctor Lucius Okere was allowed to work as a locum for ten months despite having such poor English, he didn't understand 'crash call' - the basic medical term for heart attack - thinking it meant car crash. Victims: David Gray, 70, and Ena Dickinso, 94, both died after they were treated by doctors with poor English . The Nigerian-born doctor, who qualified in Bologna, Italy, didn't know how to perform CPR, didn't wash his hands properly, and slapped patients to see if they were conscious.  He was eventually struck off by the GMC in January 2011 after it emerged that no-one in Britain had checked to see what work he had done in Italy before coming to Britain. Also in 2008, Lincolnshire grandmother Ena Dickinson, 94, lost nearly half the blood in her body during what should have been a routine hip operation after German doctor Werner Kolb severed an artery and became so flustered he started speaking in German. Another doctor had to step in to sort out the chaos but the accident left Mrs Dickinson bedbound, and her inability to walk led to her developing pneumonia that killed her eight weeks later.","Law Commission publishes draft Bill for health and social care regulation .

"By . Guy Walters . One shot, one kill: Since World War One snipers have gone from hate figures to heroes . When the fresh-faced 19-year-old arrived on the Eastern Front in August 1943, his new comrades were delighted. For several days, the entire company of the 144th Mountain Troop Regiment of the German Army had been pinned down by a solitary Russian sniper. It was the job of the new arrival ‘to get him off our backs’. The young man, an Austrian by the name of Sepp Allerberger, was led to a parapet of logs that formed the edge of the trench. Squinting through a gap, he could see nothing suspicious in No Man’s Land. He rolled up a tent and placed a cap on its top — then raised the cap above the level of the logs. After no more than a few seconds, the cap was shot off its perch. The sniper’s impetuousness would prove to be an error, because the flash from his rifle revealed his position to Allerberger. Gingerly, he eased the muzzle of his rifle through the gap in the logs. He estimated the enemy sniper to be about 100 yards away — so well within range. However, as he lined up his target, Allerberger was seized by nerves. His heart was racing and the rifle shook. He knew the cause: it would be the first time he had killed in cold blood. This, he thought, felt more like murder than combat. ‘What are you waiting for?’ hissed one of his comrades. ‘Let him have it!’ Somehow, those words helped Allerberger to calm down. He squeezed the trigger and fired — hitting the Russian right between the eyes. Despite earning many pats on his back from his comrades, Allerberger still felt a sense of revulsion at what he had done. Austrian sniper Sepp Allerberger, who was sent to the Eastern Front as a fresh-faced 19-year-old and went on to kill 257 men . During the course of the war, he would kill 257 men — a tally that makes him one of history’s deadliest snipers. However, none of his kills can match what was achieved in Afghanistan last year by an unnamed lance corporal in the Coldstream Guards. On December 14, British troops in Central Helmand had spotted a suspected Taliban suicide bomber on the move and were sent to intercept him. A firefight ensued, during which the British sniper observed a Taliban fighter armed with an AK47 climbing out of a ditch. A British sniper team patrolling Sangin, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in 2006. The sniper that killed six Taliban with one shot was on one of the last missions carried out by UK troops in Afghanistan . At a range of half a mile, the lance corporal took aim with his £25,000 L115A3 bolt-action sniper rifle, and hit the Taliban in the torso. Unknown to the marksman, the terrorist was wearing a suicide vest, which was detonated by the high-velocity round. Not only was the bomber vaporised, but so, too, were five of his fellow Taliban. With just one shot, the British sniper had killed six of the enemy. Yesterday, when news of this shot broke, it made headlines around the world, revealing our enduring fascination with snipers. The role of the sniper is very different to that of most military men. While the majority of soldiers work in units, the sniper usually works alone. 'Unsportsmanlike': An American sniper takes aim from the trenches during World War One . Camouflaged American snipers during World War One. For the first year of the war, German snipers, equipped with weapons with advanced sights, wrought havoc in the trenches . It is this notion of the sniper as the deadly lone wolf, clinically picking off the enemy from his hiding place, that so fires our imagination. However, the sniper has not always been held in such high regard. A century ago, sniping was viewed as being against the ‘rules’ of warfare. Though the British had raised a sniper unit, the Lovat Scouts, during the Second Boer War, there were many in the Army who saw sniping as underhand. It took the horrors of World War I to make the top brass realise that it was an essential part of modern warfare. For the first year of the war, German snipers, equipped with weapons with advanced sights, had wrought havoc in the trenches. As one British general ruefully admitted: ‘Certainly we were slow to adopt — indeed, our souls abhorred — anything unsportsmanlike.’ American soldier Private Charles P. Coopers peers through the telescopic sight of his modified M1 Garand rifle during World War Two . Red Army sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko was the most successful of many female World War Two snipers with 309 confirmed kills . After the Great War, nearly every army in the world developed specialist sniper schools. Marksmanship is just one of the skills that is taught, as snipers also have to perfect the art of concealment. They also act as scouts and can learn much about enemy formations through their telescopic sights. However, despite their obvious usefulness, by the outbreak of World War II, snipers were still poorly regarded by all sides. Art of camouflage: A Russian sniper at the Finnish front in 1940 . In his memoirs, Allerberger recalls how many young officers regarded snipers as ‘loathsome assassins’, and would decline their signatures when a sniper needed a kill confirmed for his record book. The most successful sniper ever was a Finn called Simo Hayha, who shot 505 Russians during 100 days of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1940. His achievement is all the more extraordinary because he did not use telescopic sights. He didn’t appear to have been troubled by his deadly achievement, and claimed never to lose a night’s sleep over his killing of so many men. ‘I only did what I was told to do, as well as I could,’ he said. Though sniping is often viewed as ‘man’s work’, World War II also  saw many female snipers, most of whom served in the Soviet Army. The most celebrated was Lyudmila Pavlichenko, with 309 confirmed kills. Killing did not come easily to her. ‘I knew my task was to kill human beings,’ she said. ‘In theory, that was fine, but I knew the real thing would be completely different.’ As with many snipers, she appeared to hesitate before her first kill. However, after witnessing the death of a comrade, she soon grew hardened — and ‘after that nothing could stop me’. Those such as Pavlichenko, Allerberger and Hayha were lucky to have survived. On the Eastern Front, the average sniper managed to fire his rifle no more than 15 to 20 times before being killed. Snipers are much less likely to die in today’s wars. Thanks to the astonishing range of their rifles, they can be more than a mile from their target and still have a chance of making a kill. With state-of-the art weaponry like the British-made L115A3 rifle which can kill from well over a mile, snipers are much less likely to die in today's wars . British Army front line sniper holding his armour piercing L115A .338-calibre sniper rifle . The longest sniper kill on record was made by a British corporal in the Blues and Royals called Craig Harrison, who in November 2009 killed two Taliban machine gunners at a range of just over one-and-a-half miles (2,475m). To make a kill at such a range requires more than just a steady hand and a good eye. Modern snipers can be equipped with laser rangefinders, instruments that measure wind direction and speed, and even computers known as ‘ballistic support devices’ that can help the sniper work out where to aim. Of course, as many snipers would tell you, some kills also require luck. Craig Harrison acknowledges that the weather conditions were near perfect for his long-range shot, with little or no wind and a lack of haze. Despite their transformation from hate figures to heroes, sniping remains a tough role for any soldier. Through their sights, snipers can see all too clearly the gory results of their work. On occasion, some kills, though necessary, make them feel very uncomfortable. The late U.S. Navy Seal sniper Chris Kyle, who found himself looking down the sights at a woman combatant carrying a grenade during his first tour in Iraq . In late March 2003, Chris Kyle, a Navy Seal sniper, found himself in Nasiriya in Iraq about to make his first sniper kill. Looking through the sights, he saw that his target was a woman carrying a hand grenade. Just like Sepp Allerberger six decades before, Kyle paused. He had never killed a woman before. ‘Take a shot!’ his platoon chief hissed. Kyle squeezed the trigger on his .300 Winchester Magnum rifle and the woman dropped to the ground before she could throw the grenade. ‘It was my duty to shoot and I don’t regret it,’ Kyle later recalled. ‘My shots saved several Americans, whose lives were clearly worth more than that woman’s twisted soul.’ But, like all snipers, for Kyle killing became chillingly routine. ‘After the first kill, the others come easy,’ he said. ‘I don’t have to psych myself up or do anything special mentally.’",Record-breaking shot was fired by a Coldstream Guards marksman .

"By . James Chapman . Good news: David Cameron today claims that three million will be exempt from income tax when a rise in the threshold takes effect on Sunday . Three million workers will have been taken out of income tax altogether when a rise in the tax threshold takes effect on Sunday, David Cameron will say today. The Prime Minister will issue a defiant message to Tory MPs who have been calling for more help for higher-rate taxpayers, as he embarks on a tour of the UK to talk up the economy. He will insist that it is right to have targeted the basic-rate threshold – saying it is among his proudest achievements. And Mr Cameron will highlight new figures from HM Revenue and Customs showing that the cumulative income tax cut over the life of this parliament will be £1,824 for the typical taxpayer. More than 26million people will benefit from the Government’s latest increase in the point at which people start to pay tax, which will reach £10,000 on Sunday. The increase will take another 200,000 part-time and lower-paid workers out of income tax entirely, most of them women. This means the total who do not pay tax will reach three million for the first time. A full-time employee on the minimum wage will pay nearly two-thirds less income tax than at the last election, while someone working for around 30 hours a week will not pay any at all. This year’s rise means that the typical taxpayer is now paying £705 a year less in income tax than they were in 2010. Ahead of a meeting in the North West today with workers who will benefit, the Prime Minister said: ‘A key part of this Government’s long-term economic plan is to cut taxes so that people can keep more of the money they earn and feel more financially secure. 'Nearly nine out of ten hard-working people across the country will benefit from this tax cut on Sunday - and it’s one of the proudest things I have done in Government.’ The Prime Minister’s remarks are likely to irritate the Liberal Democrats, who claim the credit for making personal allowance increases the Government’s top tax priority. Mr Cameron is also expected to hail the latest corporation tax cut from 23 per cent to 21 per cent, which takes effect this week. It has fallen from 28 per cent in 2010 and will fall further to 20 per cent in April 2015. The employment allowance also comes into effect – giving 1.25 million businesses and charities up to £2,000 off their National Insurance contributions. A little less taxing: Mr Cameron will highlight new figures from HM Revenue and Customs showing that the cumulative income tax cut over the life of this parliament will be £1,824 for the typical taxpayer . Mr Cameron has rejected growing calls for a halt to the number of middle-class professionals being sucked into the higher 40p rate of tax, the threshold for which has not been increased in line with the 20p threshold. Senior Tories including two former chancellors and London Mayor Boris Johnson have urged Mr Osborne to indicate he wants to ease the 40p squeeze on these workers. But the Chancellor used last week’s Budget to again raise the threshold for basic rate income tax to £10,500 from April 2015, while rejecting pleas to stop more people being dragged into the 40p tax band, which kicks in at £41,450. It will be increased by just one per cent from next year, below inflation. Ministers insist that despite this, anyone earning up to £100,000 is better off thanks to the Government’s dramatic increases in the personal allowance.","PM will issue defiant message to MPs calling for relief for higher-rate payers .

It comes just two days after the sabre-rattling state threatened to launch a 'new form' of nuclear power tests - and hours after the North and South exchanged artillery fire near a disputed sea boundary in a heightening of tensions on the peninsula.

Atomic test fears: A 5-magnitude earthquake has been registered off the coast of North Korea just two days after Kim Jong-Un threatened to launch a new nuclear tests - and hours after the North and South exchanged artillery fire near a disputed sea boundary in a heightening of tensions on the peninsula .

Suspicious: Wreckage of a crashed drone on Baengnyeong island near the disputed waters of the Yellow Sea, triggering an investigation by South Korea into whether the aircraft was from the North . South Korea was also investigating an unmanned drone which crashed on one of its islands, a South Korean defence ministry official said on Tuesday, triggering an investigation into whether the aircraft was from the North. The drone fell on Baengnyeong island at about 4pm (0700 GMT) on Monday during the artillery exchanges. The South Korean military was trying to verify where the drone had come from and what its purpose might have been, and was also looking into any possible link to North Korea's espionage operations, the military official told Reuters. On Saturday, North Korea also accused the . South of 'gangster-like' behaviour by 'abducting' one of its fishing . boats and threatened to retaliate. Has previous: Kim Jong-Un members of the military in March last year when tensions spiked after a near-daily barrage of North Korean threats, including warnings of nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington . The South said it had sent the boat back after it drifted into its waters. Hours later, Pyongyang threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point. Last spring, tension spiked after a near-daily barrage of North Korean threats, including warnings of nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington, following international criticism of Pyongyang's third nuclear test in February of that year. But the North has gradually dialed down its threats and sought to improve ties with South Korea in what foreign analysts say is an attempt to lure international investment and aid. The North Korean live-fire drills and the country's hints at a nuclear test are meant to express anger and frustration over what the North sees as little improvement in progress in its ties with South Korea and the US, said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University. Lim said the North might conduct a fourth nuclear test and launch other provocations to try to wrest the outside concessions it wants. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.","Magnitude-5 tremor detected 80 miles off peninsula at 3.48am local time .

Tragedy: The girl who was killed by a falling wall at an Edinburgh school was named locally as Keane Grace Wallis-Bennett by friends . A girl of 12 was crushed to death when a school wall collapsed yesterday after staff allegedly ignored repeated warnings that it was dangerous. Keane Wallis-Bennett screamed that she could hear something falling but was unable to scramble out of the way as the gym changing room wall crashed down, witnesses said. Paramedics were called to Liberton High School in Edinburgh but could not save her. Keane’s classmates escaped injury. Police began an investigation last night as pupils said they had warned teachers about the ‘wobbly’ wall several months ago but nothing was done. In February, Edinburgh Council was fined £8,000 after a 15-year-old pupil was seriously injured falling 16ft down a lift shaft at the school in December 2011. Second-year pupil Demi Thomson, 13, said after yesterday’s tragedy: 'There was not a bad bone in Keane’s body. She was always smiling and she had loads of friends. ‘I was told she went into the changing room and yelled out that she could hear something falling, but couldn’t get out of the way of the wall in time. ‘We have all had concerns about that changing room for a long time and lots of people complained. It is absolutely heart-breaking, everyone was in tears when they heard.’ Devon Blyth, 13, said: ‘I told staff months ago but nothing was done. I think they should have done something about it. ‘I reported it, about two months ago, that the wall had moved when I leaned on it. The member of staff said it would be fine. ‘The wall is almost the length of the changing room and it separated the showers.’ Her father, David, said: ‘It should have been dealt with when it was reported.’ Scroll down for video . Victim: The 12-year-old died after the changing room wall collapsed and crushed her as she was getting dressed for a PE lesson . Tributes: Friends and parents left flowers and cards at the school today after the tragic death of the pupil . Message: A note was left with these roses, it read: 'Rest in peace Keane, God has gained another angel. Sleep tight princess' News of the tragedy, which happened at . 10am, was broken at special assemblies but most of the 650 pupils had . already read about Keane’s death online. They were later sent home for . the day, many of them in tears. Frantic parents rushed to the school after being alerted by text message that a pupil had died in an ‘accident’. Some feared the incident could be a repeat of the 1996 Dunblane school massacre. Last . night a floral tribute was left under the entrance to the  school with . the message: ‘Rest in peace Keane. God has gained another angel.’ One of Keane’s best friends, Reece Anderton, 12, said: ‘She was really popular and funny. I will miss her terribly.’ Parents . and pupils claimed school, built 55 years ago, was crumbling and said . it had to be closed for several weeks three years ago after the roof of a . science block caved in under the weight of fallen snow. Chloe Scott, 14, ‘It is absolutely shocking, the school should be shut down. It is falling apart. ‘I’m scared to go back into school now. There are serious health and safety issues.’ Amy Gallacher, 14, said: ‘We were in class when we heard and everyone was in a complete state of shock. ‘The school should be torn down, it is not a safe place. Tragedy: The girl was killed at Liberton High School in Edinburgh just before 10am this morning, with police, fire and ambulance crews all attending the scene . Accident: Emergency services attempted to revive the girl, but the crush injuries proved fatal . ‘Teachers . knew the wall was dangerous and yet they did nothing.’ Another parent, . who asked not to be named, said: ‘I think it’s horrendous. It’s just so . sad for her family. But the school has been falling apart for years. ‘A girl fell down the lift shaft a couple of years ago and then the school had to be closed for weeks when we had heavy snow. ‘I . think it’s ridiculous when it comes to this. I heard it happened in the . old gym building, which has been there for quite some time. ‘It is an old building and things are clearly going wrong.’ Politicians . described Keane’s death as ‘tragic and troubling’ and said ‘serious . questions’ needed to be asked. Police Scotland said an inquiry into the . incident was under way. Andy Gray, from Edinburgh City Council, said he was not aware of any earlier concerns about the wall. ‘We are working with the police and the Health and Safety Executive to really find out thoroughly what has happened,’ he said. The . Edinburgh Evening News reported in December that £80million was needed . to patch up the city’s schools, but the council has only a £30million . budget for repairs. Terrible: A young student is comforted by parents at the school gates as she was taken home this afternoon . Upset: Parents came to the school to collect their children today after the terrible incident . Injuries: Morgan Seaton who fell down the lift shaft at Liberton High School three years ago. The council admitted they were to blame for the accident . Morgan Seaton was seriously injured when she plunged down a lift shaft at Liberton High, the same school where Keane Wallis-Bennett was crushed to death. The fourth-year pupil was 15 at the time of the accident in December 2011. She suffered three fractured vertebrae, bruising to her back and a sprained wrist after falling 16ft as teachers tried to free her from a broken-down lift. The teenager was spared from more serious injury only because she was wearing boots which stopped her ankles being shattered. She spent two days in hospital and was off school for a fortnight. When she returned, she was unable to sit for long periods, making studying for exams difficult. Edinburgh City Council was fined £8,000 for breaching health and safety regulations at the school. Afterwards Miss Seaton said the accident wrecked her hopes of becoming a hairdresser. She said: ‘When your back is damaged you’re going to suffer problems throughout your life and that will be the situation for me. ‘I had to give up a career in hairdressing, which was my dream, because I wouldn’t have been able to do all the standing and bending required. My back just wouldn’t have taken it. ‘It was very disappointing, because it’s what I wanted to do. I would certainly hope the council have put regulations in place to stop the same thing from happening to anyone else.’ Case: The death came just a month after a serious health and safety breach was admitted at the school where a student fell down a lift shaft .","Keane Grace Wallis-Bennett crushed by falling wall in PE block .

"By . Hugo Gye . A former Sunday school teacher who was convicted of racially abusing a family of travellers has managed to clear her name after nearly a year of fighting in the courts. José Hampson, a grandmother of three who runs a toyshop, was fined £1,380 for allegedly launching a foul-mouthed race rant after scraping her car on a gatepost. But she has now been vindicated after a court ruled that she was innocent and wiped her record clean. Vindicated: José Hampson has been cleared of racially abusing a family of travellers . The former school governor, who had never been in trouble with the law, said she was 'absolutely sickened' by her initial conviction, adding that the experience was '11 months of hell'. Mrs Hampson, 78, was convicted of racially aggravated harassment in August last year after Michael Linfoot, who lived on a traveller site near her home, alleged that she had called him and his family 'dirty f****** gypos'. On Friday, she had the conviction overturned at Preston Crown Court, and will not have to pay any of the fines and court costs which were previously imposed on her. Mrs Hampson has run Hampson's Toymaster in Chorley, Lancashire with her family for more than six decades, and is considered a pillar of the community. Shop: Mrs Hampson and her family have run a toyshop in Chorley, Lancashire for six decades . 'Victims': Michael Linfoot, left, and his wife Patty, right, claimed they were racially abused . Speaking after the hearing, the . pensioner said: 'I was absolutely sickened to be convicted over . something that was nothing more than a pack of lies and it is a great . relief to clear my name. 'I . was made to feel guilty of something I didn't do even though I always . knew I was innocent. When I was convicted I couldn't believe it, and . since then life has been dreadful. It has been 11 months of hell. 'I . could not believe an innocent person could be found guilty in a British . court of law and the whole thing has been incredibly stressful. Court battle: Mrs Hampson pictured outside court during her original trial last August . 'My . good character was destroyed and shopkeepers and the business community . turned their back on me. My son now owns the shop and business and . sales were affected. I could not allow this to happen.' During the original . trial, Mrs Hampson told the court she was returning home from the . toyshop in April last year when she found the lane to her house partly . blocked by a van which she had previously seen parked on an illegal . traveller site. She . scraped her car trying to squeeze past it, so she decided to reverse . back down the lane and turn around in the site's entrance. She . told the court Mr Linfoot came running over, shouting, 'What the . f****** hell are you doing on my land?', but that she replied: 'You're . not supposed to be on this land, it's green belt.' Mr . Linfoot claimed she then told him: 'Look at my f****** wheel' and 'I'm . f****** sick of you lot, you're illegal, you should all f*** off you . dirty f****** gypos.' Despite her denials, Mrs Hampson was convicted and ordered to pay a £690 fine, £620 costs and a £69 victim surcharge. She said: 'My faith in the British justice system has been really shaken. I should never have been convicted in the first place but now I'm just so happy I can finally put it behind me. 'I was so nervous on the way to court and I very nearly turned my car around but I knew I had to see it through. I want to forget about everything that's happened and move on with my life. 'Throughout it all, my family have stood by me and the support I have had has been amazing. I have had 11 months of worry and shame, but what was most important to me is that justice was done and I was vindicated.' Crucially, testimonials from local people to Mrs Hampson’s impeccable character were read at the appeal, whereas she was denied the opportunity at her original trial. Last night Mr Linfoot said he was disappointed by the outcome. ‘The judge said we were credible witnesses, he also said someone was lying,’ he said. ‘We continue to have faith in the police and if we believe we are victims of racial abuse we will call them again. ‘We are extremely disappointed in how the Crown Prosecution Service handled the case and we are considering a complaint.’","José Hampson, 78, was convicted of calling a family of travellers 'dirty f****** gypos' during a dispute over a driveway .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A British security team was sent to the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to assess the terror threat ahead of the tourist season. Every year thousands of British holidaymakers travel to the resort on the Red Sea but with the Easter holidays approaching, the government is reviewing advice to those heading to the southern Sinai region. After a tourist bus carrying 30 holidaymakers was attacked in Taba in South Sinai, close to the border with Israel in February, a team thought to include armed forces personnel was sent to investigate the vulnerability of nearby Sharm el-Sheikh. Review: A British security team was sent to the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to assess the terror threat ahead of the tourist season . The Egyptian bus driver was killed, along with three tourists from South Korea, who had been visiting Christian sites in the region, in the bombing on February 16. According to Egyptian Interior Ministry spokesman Hani Abdel-Latif, the driver and two tourists had got out of the bus to check the cargo hold but as they were re-boarding, a suicide bomber pushed through the open door into the bus and detonated his explosives. Militant Islamic group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, Arabic for Champions of Jerusalem, which had previously only targetted police and the military, claimed responsibility for the roadside attack, saying one of its â€˜heroesâ€™ carried out the bombing. Several holiday companies stopped sending tourists to the area following the bombing, and operators Thomas Cook and Tui decided to fly German tourists home early on the advice of the government in Berlin. Assessment: The team, thought to include armed forces personnel, was sent to investigate the vulnerability of Sharm el-Sheikh after a tourist bus was attacked in Taba . The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office updated guidance given to tourists after the blast, warning against travelling . to other Red Sea resorts including Taba, Nuweiba and Dahab, and advising against taking excursions to historic sites including St Catherine's . Monastery and Petra in Jordan. It said tourists should stay within the Sharm el-Sheikh resort area, where enhanced security measures were in place, including Egyptian military check points around the resort including at the airport. The Egyptian government believes that safety concerns have now been addressed and yesterday the country's ambassador to London said the FCO restrictions did not need to be tightened, despite a number of attacks by Islamist groups protesting the overthrowing of former President Mohammed Morsi - the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. 'We have had a team from the security . forces of Britain in the tourist areas to monitor the measures and see . what measures are in place that are satisfactory,' Ashraf Elkholy told . the Daily Telegraph. 'The security team has been there and we have cooperated and we hope that the decision taken will be the right one.' Unrest: There have been a number of attacks by Islamist groups protesting the overthrowing of former President Mohammed Morsi (pictured) - the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood . Clash: Egyptian security forces clash with Islamist university students in Cairo . Officials from the FCO have said there would be no immediate change in travel advice for Sharm el-Sheikh, but that the situation was being monitored and the information would be updated if necessary. Elections are due to be held to elect a new president next month, after President Morsi was deposed by the Egyptian military, and protesting groups are expected to target the polls. The country's powerful former military . chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the overthrow of Islamist President . Morsi last summer, has announced his bid for office and is . widely expected to win. 'What we have to expect during . this procedure is an increase in terrorist action as they have to prove . themselves and unfortunately Egyptians and non-Egyptians will be the . targets of this,' said Mr Elkholy. Companies including Thomas Cook and Tui continue to provide package holidays to the area - which is popular with many British tourists who flock to its many beaches, due to the year-round warm climate and clear waters. Loss: It was revealed last month that Egypt had seen a 28 per cent drop in the number of tourists visiting the country this year . However, it was revealed last month that Egypt had seen a 28 per cent drop in the number of tourists visiting the country this year. According to the statistics released by Egypt's Ahram newspaper, there has been a 24 per cent drop in European tourists visiting the country in January and February this year, when compared to 2013 figures. They contribute to an overall 28 per cent decrease in visitor numbers when visitors form other key markets, such as the Middle East and Arab countries, are taken into account. One of the biggest losses was from the Asia and Pacific markets, with 42 per cent less visitors venturing to Egypt than during the same period last year. The country's tourism sector accounts . for roughly nine per cent of GDP, but has experienced several setbacks . since President Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down in 2011. In . 2010, Egypt received 14.7million visitors, which was a record high, but . numbers dipped to just 10million in 2011 before climbing again to . 11.5million in 2012.","Government reviewing advice to tourists travelling to southern Sinai region .

"By . Jim Norton . British scientists have developed a forecast model that they claim will be able to predict extreme winter weather with up to 80 per cent accuracy. If accurate, it could strongly influence the economy, with advanced warnings giving  airports, councils, insurers and hospitals more information with which to prepare. The breakthrough comes after the Met Office was criticised for its ‘pitiful’ forecasts last winter – thought to be the worst predictions since Michael Fish’s infamous reassurance that there was no hurricane on the way in October 1987. Stuff of legend: Michael Fish famously failed to predict the 1987 hurricane - but he relied on others' data . Last November, the Met Office told councils to expect ‘drier than usual’ conditions – only for the UK to suffer the wettest winter since records began. Until now, even powerful super-computers have been able to perform only slightly better than chance when predicting long-term weather conditions. But the latest model, which simulates the climate on a more detailed scale, was found to be 62 per cent accurate at broad predictions of weather conditions when it was tested on 20 years of retrospective data. And scientists at the Met Office claim the reliability will improve, estimating that accuracy will increase to 80 per cent. The breakthrough is due to stronger computing power, allowing scientists to take into account much smaller changes in the gulfstream and Arctic sea ice coverage, which impact on the British climate. The Met Office’s Adam Scaife said: ‘This will have enormous benefits for the economy and society, and mean that planners can prepare well ahead for winter.’ Dramatic: A stormy winter this year followed wrongly-placed reassurances from the Met Office . Airports and councils would have a better idea how much grit would be needed, while power companies and wind farms would be able to anticipate energy demands, and hospitals could prepare for increases of accidents caused by the ice and snow. And after the wettest winter on record, insurers would be able to estimate the potential risks of winter storms. It is also a huge boon for the Met Office, which has been highly embarrassed in the past by its seasonal predictions. In 2009, it forecast a ‘barbecue summer’, which proved to be a washout. And last November, a three-month forecast by the Met Office suggested only the East and South East might expect average rainfall. The forecasters told councils there would be a ‘significant reduction in precipitation compared to average’ for most of the country. Instead, local authorities saw some of the most severe flooding in decades. Professor Scaife said: ‘If used carefully there’s a good chance of winning, but no guarantee. ‘It’s not possible to predict the outcome every year but we’re doing it with increasing skill.’","Scientists developed new model to forecast weather months in advance .

"By . Richard Spillett . A mum-of-four was burned to death after her boyfriend discovered she'd been having an affair with his 18-year-old son, a court heard. Ashley Williams, 49, put tape over the mouth of his  24-year-old girlfriend Julie Beattie and hit her with a hammer before dousing her in petrol, the Old Bailey was told. Miss Beattie staggered out of their house in Walworth, south London, shrouded in flames and later died from 90 per cent burns, the jury were told. The court heard Julie Beattie, left, was planning to move in with Ashley Williams Jnr, right, on the day she died . Jurors heard that Miss Beattie had told father-of-12 Williams she was leaving him for his 18-year-old son, Ashley Williams Jnr, before the attack. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said: 'That was why the defendant carried out the dreadful act of revenge that he did. 'Julie Beattie died a terrible death. The medical staff at the burns unit did all they could but her injuries were such that she could not be saved.' She died of her injuries in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. The court heard her last words were: 'Ashley did this to me.' Hours before the alleged attack, Miss Beattie’s sister Lucy had gone to help Miss Beattie collect her belongings and move in with her new lover, Ashley Jnr, the court heard. But Williams, who was suspicious of Miss Beattie, returned home early from his work as an Islington Council groundsman to tried and stop her. Lucy Beattie said she left to give the troubled couple space but, when she came back, she saw her sister stumble out of the house in flames, the court heard. Ashley Williams Jnr, who was Williams' son from a previous marriage, attended his father's murder trial at the Old Bailey today . Prosecutor Mr Brown said: 'The fire that killed her was deliberately set by this defendant. 'He used petrol that was likely to have been mixed with diesel. The liquid must have been on her when it was ignited. 'Her other injuries were to the top of her head. He had hit her with a hammer. 'That did not kill her. It was the flames that killed her, but that combination of injuries tells you much of the defendant’s actions in those dreadful moments.' The court heard Ashley Williams Jnr, pictured, and Miss Beattie started a relationship after he moved in with her and his father . The court heard Williams had eight children with a previous wife, including Ashley Jnr. He then started seeing Miss Beattie’s mum Linda, who had three children, including Julie, from a previous relationship. When that relationship broke down, Williams began seeing Miss Beattie, who he went on to have four young children with, the first being born when she was just 16. Jurors heard things began to deteriorate between the couple when Williams’ son Ashley Jnr moved in with them in September 2012. Miss Beattie and Ashley Jnr started a sexual relationship and on the day of Miss Beattie's death, the pair were planning to set up home together in Catford, south east London, the court heard. Prosecutor Mr Brown said Williams, who did nothing to try and help Miss Beattie, was arrested in a park shortly after the attack. He had slit his wrists and police were alerted to him after following a trail of blood from the house, the court heard. Weeks before the attack he had tried to take an overdose of pills, jurors were told. Mr Brown said that when police approached him he said: 'I am the man you are looking for'. Mr Brown added: 'The cause of this lady's terrible death was this defendant's deliberate act. He was angry, aggressive and seeking revenge for what he considered she had done to him. 'She was beaten by him with a hammer to the top of her head, no doubt when standing over her and then set light to her. 'There can have been no other intention for what he did so but to cause her at least really serious harm or indeed death.' Williams, of Walworth, south east London, denies murder.

"By . Leon Watson . A former aide to MP George Galloway has been jailed for possessing a batch of 'explicit' photos of her policeman lover and his estranged wife. Aisha Ali-Khan, 33, got her hands on the intimate snaps after marrying counter-terror officer Mohammed Azif Khan, 47, in an Islamic ceremony in Pakistan in 2009. Fearing the photos could be about to be made public, his estranged wife Naheed Khan, who is still legally married to the Met officer, launched a High Court bid to block their disclosure. Last December, the Watford mother-of-two won a court order, requiring the politician’s former PA to hand over or destroy the embarrassing images. The former aide to Bradford West MP George Galloway, Aisha Ali-Khan (left) with her husband Metropolitan Police Detective Inspector Afiz Khan, arrive at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London . But Ms Ali-Khan, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, failed to do so and has now been jailed for three months for contempt of court by Judge Richard Seymour. Ms Ali-Khan, who teaches English at a school in Leeds, worked for Mr Galloway’s Respect party before allegations in 2012 that she slept with Det Insp Khan at the MP's Streatham home. It resulted in the controversial MP for Bradford West writing an open letter to Home Secretary, Theresa May, demanding an inquiry. Judge Seymour told the court: 'It appears that Mr Khan, on the occasion of a visit to Pakistan, went through a form of marriage with the defendant. 'As a result, it appears, of each of Mrs Khan and the defendant sharing the affections of Mr Khan, the defendant seems to have come into possession of some confidential photographs and digital images of Mrs Khan. 'Mrs Khan became aware of the position as a result of exchanges between the parties and consequently commenced proceedings against the defendant, seeking damages and various injunctions.' Aisha Ali-Khan, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, failed to hand over the photos and has now been jailed for three months for contempt of court by Judge Richard Seymour . Faced with the prospect of the spat being revealed in open court, Ms Ali-Khan last December consented to an order under which she promised to get rid of the images. However, four months later, she had still not shown that she had done so, leading to Naheed Khan’s application to the High Court to commit her to prison. Outlining the contempt allegation, barrister Andrew Bodnar said: 'An order has been made. It was not only made, but agreed to by the defendant. She was well aware of its terms. Respect Party MP George Galloway gestures from an open top bus outside his campaign office in Bradford . 'She has had multiple opportunities to comply. She has failed to do so and she has offered no explanation, even today, for her failure to comply.' He said Mrs Khan, as a mother-of-two, deserved to be able to put the sorry affair behind her in the knowledge that she has won and the photos will not see the light of day. Representing herself, Ms Ali-Khan complained of having been pressured into consenting to the order last December and said she now wanted to set aside the agreement. She said she no longer has any photos of Mrs Khan, claiming to have destroyed all copies before she had even signed the consent order. Giving judgment, Judge Seymour said: 'People in your position, when an application is made to be committed to prison, sometimes belatedly do what they have been ordered to do. You haven’t. 'Sometimes people come to court when assigned to deal with an application for committal to prison and say ‘I’m sorry, I know I haven’t done it, but I will do it now’. You haven’t said that. 'What you had to do as a result of the agreement you entered into was very straight-forward. You understood what you had to do. You simply didn’t do it. 'It is usually a good idea to look contrite when you come to court when it is said you are in contempt of court. Jailing her, he continued: 'The defendant has decided from a fairly early point after signing the consent order that she was not going to comply. 'In all of the circumstances, I have no alternative but to commit the defendant to prison for a period of three months.' Ms Ali-Khan, who told the judge she was 'in shock', was led from the court in tears by a female security officer. She was ordered to pay an estimated £10,000 court costs bill. Mrs Khan declined to comment.","Aisha Ali-Khan found pictures of her 'husband' and his estranged wife .

A man who had to have part of his skull removed and replaced after being punched has forgiven the attacker who left him fighting for his life. Daniel Brown suffered life-threatening brain injuries when he was attacked in a bar - but has said he is prepared to forgive the man who almost killed him. The 20-year-old was knocked unconscious when he was punched by Jamie Robinson, also 20, in the early hours of September 7. Robinson knocked Mr Brown out at the Britannia bar in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire with a single punch, which sent his victim sprawling down a a single punch to his head caused him to fall down a staircase. The blow caused Daniel to the floor and left him with a fractured skull, swelling, bruising, a bleed on his brain and a blood clot. Daniel needed an operation to remove part of his skull and his family was told there was a strong possibility he could die. Jamie Robinson, 20, from Scunthorpe, was recently sentenced to 30 months in a young offenders’ institution after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm. Daniel said: 'I forgive him because I believe in forgiving, but I won’t forget and he is certainly someone I will never have any time for. 'I wouldn’t wish what happened on anyone and I am a better person than that. I will never get the last six months back and I will have the scars with me forever. But I am not ashamed of the scars because it wasn’t anything of my doing.' Mr Brown was given craniectomy surgery at Hull Royal Infirmary to remove part of his skull and relieve the pressure from his swelling brain. Speaking of his time since the unprovoked attack, he said: 'It has been hell. I have not been able to do the things I would normally do, such as social things with friends, going on nights out or going to football matches. 'I am hoping it is all behind me now and I can get back to normal life. Daniel who works as a waiter said he had little recollection of the events leading to the incident in the Britannia. 'Scared we would lose him': After the attack Mr Brown's parents Lisa and Ian had to prepare for the possibility that he would not survive . 'I remember on the night it happened, I finished work at Domino's and drove to my friend’s because we were going out in town that night. 'We had a couple of drinks and got a taxi up to town, but I don’t remember going into any clubs or anything like that. 'All I can remember since is what my family and friends who were there at the time have said. 'I woke up in Hull Royal Infirmary with no idea of what had gone on... I was in there and had no idea why. I thought I had been cheated by life really. 'I have been in the Britannia a lot and it is not a rough club. Of all the places for it to happen, that would not have been one of my top guesses. 'For someone who is not a violent person at all, it is painful, but we are all happy that justice has been done.' Mr Brown had an operation last week to replace the section of his skull which was removed in the craniectomy. He is due to have the staples from the procedure removed in early April, before attending an outpatient appointment in Hull in around six weeks. When he was first able to get out of bed in hospital, Daniel struggled to walk, which he described in a court statement as a 'huge setback'. Venue: Mr Brown was knocked out with a single blow from his attacker in the early hours of the morning at the Britannia bar in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire . 'Cheated': Mr Brown has spoken of the pain of missing out on the six months he spent recovering from the attack . But speaking after the case, he said: 'The thing that has kept me going all along is getting back to how things were. 'Some people you see with brain injuries are motivated and others not so much. 'I have always said I am a firm believer that I have got to wake up every day wanting to get better and get back to my life because if you don’t want it, you are never going to get it. 'I feel lucky that I have had no major lasting injuries such as memory loss or lack of mobility. 'I feel cheated that I have lost so much of my life but grateful to be here with my family. I am most annoyed at what he put the people I care about the most through, like my family. 'From the start, I wasn’t really aware of it but it is not just one person, it is everybody.' His father Ian Brown, 45, described the feelings the family had when they were told about his injuries and during his recovery process. Me said: 'It is hard to put it into words how we felt. To be told to prepare for the worst and then have to come home and tell the rest of the family is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone. 'We had to sit down with our other three children and explain how poorly their brother was and how there was a very strong possibility he might not make it. 'To take them over to Hull on the Sunday to see Daniel because it might be the last time they saw him alive was heartbreaking. 'To spend the next two or three weeks visiting Hull and watching Daniel have to learn to do everything again was an awful time. 'It is hard to put into words the feeling of helplessness, but we helped where we could and we carried out a bedside vigil. 'To us, it has been six-and-a-half terribly long months, but in the bigger scheme of things, it is a remarkable recovery.' Scott Slingsby, owner of the Britannia bar, said: 'It is the worst incident I have known in my 25 years in the licensing trade. 'Robinson has been barred for life from the Britannia and he has been put under a five-year ban by other members of the Scunthorpe Pub Watch. '","Daniel Brown, 20, was attacked on a night out in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire .

"By . Richard Spillett . Maxine Difford thinks she had been denied her pension because of a lack of understanding of her rare, incurable condition, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome . A mother has been left struggling to survive after a police force failed to give her pension in case her incurable condition suddenly improves. Maxine Difford, 40, suffers constant pain from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) - a rare and poorly understood chronic pain condition. She was dismissed due to ill health from Kent Police where she had worked as a team leader in the control room for more than 11 years. Mrs Difford, who managed up to 17 members of staff, understood she would qualify to receive her pension early. But since leaving her post in May last year the force has refused to give her any financial support - saying she might be well enough to work again before she is 65. The distraught mother-of-one blames a lack of understanding about her debilitating condition for leaving her family struggling to get by. Mrs Difford, of Ashford, Kent, said: 'Initially they were good to me and helped me where they can. I worked from home for a while but eventually they dismissed me. 'I was led to believe that if I was dismissed on ill health grounds then I would be able to claim my pension. They talked as if I was going to get it. 'CRPS is incurable. I have gone into remission once but I have done lots of research and it is very unlikely to happen again.' Mrs Difford was diagnosed with CRPS after a skiing accident when she was 16-years-old. She has had 25 operations trying to alleviate the condition, but nothing has worked. She is on the highest prescribable dose of Oxycontin - a synthetic painkiller of codeine and morphine - to try and make day-to-day living bearable. Mother-of-one Mrs Difford and her husband Ricky have criticised claims by her former employer Kent Police that her condition may suddenly improve . But she is still so sore she cannot enjoy hugging her seven-year-old son Robbie. She added: 'The drugs only take the edge off the pain. It is excruciating. 'It started off feeling like I have a dagger twisting in my knee and now it affects most of my leg and feels like my whole leg is on fire and I can’t put it out. 'I just want to be doing all the things you take for granted with a little boy. I want to be taking him to the park, playing, cuddling.' Mrs Difford said she was told in July last year that her application for a pension had been declined on the grounds that the independent expert who assessed her had said she may recover by the time she is 65. The practitioner wrote: 'The evidence supports that at the current time her symptoms would prevent her from doing her substantive role but not that she has a reduced likelihood of being capable of undertaking any gainful employment before her normal retirement age.' Mrs Difford appealed the decision and was referred to a second independent medical practitioner but she lost her case. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome usually develops after an injury, often a minor injury. The pain is often unconnected to the seriousness of the injury and can be out of all proportion from what the sufferer would expect. The condition is little-understood, but some medical experts think it is caused by damage to the nervous system, which causes nerves to misfire in some way, triggering pain. If left untreated the pain can spread to other parts of the body too. Some sufferers have repeated episodes of pain followed by stretches of pain-free remission. It can be treated by physiotherapy, to prevent muscle wasting, certain types of painkillers and counselling to help people cope with the chronic pain. However, CRPS expert Gill Thurlow, consultant nurse at the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital who treat Mrs Difford, said: 'Every person with CRPS presents differently and has a different prognosis. 'We would expect 70 per cent of patients to get back to work - but it depends on the speed of diagnosis. 'We saw Mrs Difford when she was about 15 years down the line. I do not believe Mrs Difford would be fit enough to return to an office-based job. 'There is a problem with early diagnosis. Some GPs have never seen this condition before.' Husband Ricky, 46, who runs a property maintenance business, said: 'I think it's absolutely disgraceful that they haven’t given Max her pension.' Many cases of CRPS are misdiagnosed, but it is estimated that one in 3,800 people in the UK suffer from the condition and three in four of those are women. Kent Police said: 'We are not able to comment on individual cases, though can confirm that the organisation both meets and, in some cases exceeds, the guidelines set out by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS). 'The Force has no discretion around the regulations outlined in the Local Government Pension policy and, should someone fail to meet the criteria for benefits within the scheme, the decision cannot be overturned by any individual within the organisation. 'Kent Police will fully cooperate with any complaint made to the Pensions Ombudsman.' Under Government guidelines employers can dismiss staff if they cannot fulfill their role and there are 'no reasonable adjustments that can be made'.","Maxine Difford worked for Kent Police as a control room leader for 11 years .

"By . Paul Bentley . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is among five shadow cabinet members who feature on the list of MPs vulnerable to voters in private rented accommodation . Ed Balls was yesterday named on a hit list of MPs warned they face losing their seats in parliament if they neglect private home renters. Research suggests the nine million Britons forced to rent because they cannot afford to buy a home will have a crucial sway at next year's general election. Campaigners have now identified 86 MPs who stand to lose if they alienate 'Generation Rent' and fail to crack down on high rents, poor conditions and abuses by landlords and estate agents. More than half of the politicians listed are Tories or Lib Dems - suggesting the issue could directly impact the coalition's ability to hold on to power. The most senior MPs under threat individually, however, are from the Labour Party. Shadow chancellor Mr Balls is among five shadow cabinet members who feature on the list. Also at risk are Mary Creagh, Chuka Umunna, Sadiq Khan and Gloria de Piero. The study, produced by ComRes for the campaigning organisation Generation Rent, found 35 per cent of the nine million people in the private rented sector describe themselves as floating voters, who could sway at the next election. Mr Balls, MP for Morley and Outwood, holds a majority of just 1,101. Some 5,222 voters in his constituency rent their homes privately and the research suggests almost 2,000 of them could switch their vote as the undecided 35 per cent. Ms De Piero, Labour MP for Ashfield and shadow minister for women and equality, is particularly at risk with a vote margin of just 192 and more than 5,000 private renters in her constituency. According to the ComRes poll, 46 per cent of those in privately rented homes said they would currently support Labour based on its policies and 23 per cent would vote Conservative. One in ten who voted Tory at the 2010 General Election said they would now vote Labour. The study found 35 per cent of the nine million people in the private rented sector describe themselves as floating voters . Researchers found 12 per cent would vote Liberal Democrat and 11 per cent would vote for the UK Independence Party. Alex Hilton, from Generation Rent, said: 'After years of being ignored by Westminster, Britain's private renters will decide whether MPs will keep their jobs. 'The election won't be about Mondeo Man, Worcester Woman or Basildon Man. Anyone who wants to move into Downing Street in 2015 needs to win over Generation Rent.' Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'We are taking action against the small minority of rogue landlords and letting agents, but avoiding excessive red tape, which would force up rents and reduce choice for tenants.'","The 86 MPs could get boot if high rents and landlord abuses aren't tackled .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Jailed: Amir Saleem lied that he was a barrister and brain surgeon for almost 20 years and even won a client a court case . A serial conman who made false claims of being a brain surgeon and a barrister for nearly 20 years has finally been jailed. He was exposed, ironically, after posing as a barrister and winning a court case against another fraudster. Amir Saleem, 42, won almost £8,000 for his client at Manchester's Civil Justice Centre in a lawsuit against known conman Selva Carmichael. But Saleem’s conduct in court was his downfall. Despite losing, the opposing legal team became suspicious that Saleem wasn’t a real barrister when he used ‘nonsensical legal propositions’ and made the bizarre boast that he was actually a brain surgeon who merely ‘dabbled in law’. The police were called and an 11-month investigation revealed that he’d been spinning an astonishing web of lies over a number of years – and had conned his first victim, an ex-girlfriend, out of tens of thousands of pounds. They also found he’d used false legal qualifications to study law and set up a solicitor’s firm and made claims to his ex that he was a multimillionaire brain surgeon ‘who lived near the Beckhams’. Saleem was actually penniless and a stay-at-home son who slept in the spare room of his parents’ house. He met his first victim, a 45-year-old divorcee, in 2004, through a dating website. He convinced her to look at prestige homes for sale in the Mere area of Cheshire as well as two Mercedes cars - and she loaned him £40,000 from her £66,000 divorce settlement. During their four-year relationship the woman, a nurse, had a child before splitting up with him in 2009 after she became increasingly wary of his tall tales. Saleem later tried to sue her for custody of their child, and her parents had to remortgage their home to pay the £25,000 legal costs. In a statement she said: ‘Amir has totally destroyed my life, both financially and psychologically. I ended up off work sick with depression for 12 months. He has made a total fool out of me. In July 2012 he met his next victim, Lisa Walmsley. Boast: Saleem said that he was a millionaire brain surgeon with celebrity neighbours, but in fact lived in this semi-detached house with his parents . He told her he was a barrister and said he would be able to help her over her legal battle with  conman Carmichael, 53, who she claimed took a £42,000 investment from her for a TV production venture and breached terms of a contract. Little did Ms Walmsley know that Saleem had made up his credentials. Police said Saleem had used entirely false qualifications and fraudulent degree certificates to win places on a number of University Degree courses between 1997 and 2012. They included Kings College, Huddersfield University, College of Law in Birmingham, College of Law in Bloomsbury and BPP Law School. He eventually created a bogus law firm, Century Law, using forged degree certificates. But that didn’t stop him taking the case and audaciously representing her in court. He wasn’t convincing enough for the defendant’s legal representation, though – and neither did he pull the wool over the eyes of the judge. The judge asked him to write down some information about his legal background, but Saleem misspelt ‘Gray's Inn Square Barristers' Chambers’. At Manchester Crown Court on Tuesday, Saleem, of Ladybarn, near Stockport, was jailed for four years and four months after he pleaded guilty to seven counts of deception and one count of carrying out a reserved legal activity. Detective Con Beth Colbourne from Greater Manchester Police said: ‘Saleem convinced both women they could trust him and rely on him. ‘He used the pretence that he was a barrister and brain surgeon to gain their trust even further, leading to him deceiving one of his victims out of thousands of pounds. ‘Even upon his arrest for the original offence, his lying continued and he tried to convince the officer that the victims and witnesses were mistaken and he was in fact a student. ‘Thankfully, we were able to see through his lies and he is now serving time behind bars.’ Passing sentence Judge David Stockdale QC said Saleem was a ‘knowing and manipulative fraudster’. Saleem’s lawyer David Martin-Sperry said: ‘He lived in a fantasy world. The theme is very much of self-aggrandisement - and misguided optimism how things would turn out.’","Amir Saleem, 42, brazenly posed as a barrister at a court in Manchester .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The sons of one of Britain’s richest men face jail after they randomly attacked two off-duty policemen after their Christmas party in central London. George Panayiotou, 26 and his brother Costas, 24, whose father Greek-Cypriot property tycoon Andreas is believed to be worth £400 million, left an off-duty policeman needing titanium plates in his cheek and eye socket after the unprovoked attack. The two brothers and two friends today pleaded guilty to affray after they attacked the off-duty policemen returning from a night out in Soho. Court: Christopher Stavrou (left) leaves Southwark Crown Court with property tycoon Andreas Panayiotou (centre) and his son Costas (right). Today Stavrou and Costas Panayiotou admitted affray after attacking two off-duty policemen. They are due to return for sentencing on May 2 . Costas Panayiotou was also charged with grievous bodily harm but the Crown accepted his plea to the lesser charge. Prosecutor Michael Hall told Southwark Crown Court how on the night of November 30, five off-duty officers were leaving their Christmas party at the Strawberry Moon club in Soho. As they walked down Piccadilly, they came across the brothers and Yiannaki Stavrou, 30, and Christopher Stavrou, 28, who were on the other side of the road.

Andreas Panayiotou started boxing at seven, . showing immediate talent, and left school at 15 (‘with straight As, for . Absent!’) in order to become a middleweight fighter; Yiannaki Stavrou along with his brother pleaded guilty to affray after attacking two off-duty policemen after their Christmas party . George Panayiotou was play fighting with one of his group before pushing him towards the road.Mr Hall said: ‘One of the officers shouts ‘Oi purple baseball cap’ and the officers then keep on walking.’ Costas Panayiotou then punched a man returning home from a nightclub with his girlfriend before he crossed the road to attack a policeman. Mr Hall added: ‘Then he punches the off duty officer Gavin Collins, knocking him to the ground and either the punch or his impact with the ground causes an impacted fracture of his cheek and eye socket that requires surgery and the fixing of titanium plates and screws.’ ‘Yiannakis Stavros then ran across the road and punched another officer, Matthew Holland, from behind. ‘He is joined by the other two who join in punching Pc Holland as he retreated backwards.

Put up your dukes: Boxer-turned-property magnate, Andreas Panayiotou is one of Britain's richest men with a fortune said to run to £400million. The former champion boxer won 52 of his 53 amateur fights before quitting at the age of 20 . Mr Hall said: ‘Matthew Holland is then set upon by all four defendants, punching and kicking him, at one point finding himself on the ground, where they continued to punch and kick him.’ The attack only stopped when door staff from nearby clubs intervened. The defendants ran down Regent Street towards Glasshouse Street but were arrested in January 2013 after police identified them by their clothing. Recorder Christopher Hehir said that the four defendants had been very ‘wise’ in pleading guilty but added: ‘The seriousness of the offence means all options, including custody, are open.’ The nightclubber attacked as he walked with his girlfriend as never been traced. The brothers, who live in Barnet, Hertfordshire, and their accomplices, also of Barnet, were released on bail and are due to be sentenced on May 2. George Panayiotou appeared on the reality show Desperate Scousewives while he opened a nightclub, PlayGround, near the Albert Docks. 'I love life and grateful for the position I'm in. Health and happiness is all that really matter to me,' he told the producers. 'Liverpool is a place where everyone is regarded the same and no one sticks their nose up at you for what you do or don't have, everyone wants to party.' The marble bathroom at heath Hall. It has been claimed that Andreas is an example of why money cannot buy taste . George and Costas are the sons of self-made millionaire Andreas Panayiotou. Born in 1966, to Greek Cypriot . parents who ran a dry cleaning shop in Mile End, east London, he . suffered from severe dyslexia as a child. A former boxer - whose dream of turning pro was nipped in the bud by his parents after they gave him a dry-cleaning shop in 1986. By the . early 1990s he had built up a chain of six shops across north London. In 1992, he was offered a chance to . buy a flat above one of his shops in Caledonian Road - which he renovated, sold and turned a £20,000 profit. After . that, he purchased a property in Islington’s Chapel Street Market, . built four flats above it, and began renting them to local yuppies. Mr Panayiotou was soon dubbed . London’s buy-to-let king, with almost 6,000 rental properties, including . 600-unit apartment blocks in Canary Wharf and the West End in his . portfolio. Last year, as he attempted to sell his £65m Grade II-listed, red-brick mansion called Heath Hall, Mr Panayiotou defended his, somewhat extravagant, taste to the Daily Mail. At the time, the . Mail’s A.N. Wilson led the charge against what he called the vast . mansion’s ‘swanky opulence’. With its white leather sofas, black-lined . swimming pools, remote-controlled curtains and purple lighting, it was, . Wilson wrote, as ‘impersonally hideous as a brothel’. Heath Hall was a derelict shell when Andreas bought it and saw its potential . The decor has been described as vulgar, but Andreas disputes this . Heath Hall is a 14-bedroom mansion in North London and was orignally put on the market in 2011 for a guide price of £100 million . ‘These places are not homes, they are exercises in self-promotion and self-advertisement,’ he wrote. But Mr Panayiotou said he had devoted the past . five years to renovating Heath Hall, which sits in 2.5 acres of . landscaped grounds, and includes six reception rooms, a billiard room, a . cinema, indoor and outdoor pools, and no fewer than 12 bathrooms. He said allegations of ‘vulgarity’ were simply motivated by envy of the self-made man. He . also accused critics of failing to appreciate the ‘top quality’ nature . of painstaking restoration work on the building, which he paid more than . 120 craftsmen to carry out. ‘These . guys are jealous, and, since they haven’t actually been to Heath Hall, . they’ve got no idea what they’re talking about,’ he argued.
