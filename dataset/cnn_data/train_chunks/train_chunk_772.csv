"By . Louise Boyle . A mother-of-13 accused of offering a hit man up to $10,000 to murder her husband wanted the crime committed in fall to make it look like a hunting accident, a court heard on Thursday. Wendy Farley, 48, faces up to 30 years in prison if she is found guilty of soliciting the murder of husband Luther 'Rusty' Farley, 53, in 2012. The Piscataquis county court in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, heard an alleged secret tape of Farley asking cab driver Michael Anderson to shoot her husband once in the head while he was out chopping wood so that his death could be disguised as a hunting accident. Wendy Farley, 48, pictured in court on Thursday, and her attorney Peter Rodway. The mother-of-13 stands accused of hiring a hit man to murder her husband in 2012 . Michael Anderson, 51, testified on Thursday that he met Mrs Farley, of Brownville, at a gig at a restaurant in Milo in early September 2012. Mr Anderson said that the logger's wife was specific about the details of the contract killing of her husband of 30 years. She wanted a .30-.30 rifle used and offered $1,000 cash up front with the rest coming later, the Bangor Daily News reported. Mr Anderson told the court: 'I thought she was . blowing off steam, but the second time she brought it up, I realized she . was focused [on it]. 'A chill went through me. I knew the lady was serious, and that that man was going to die.' Mr Anderson, who denied his nickname was 'Mafia Mike' but admitted that some people called him that, went to local police about Farley's claims. He agreed to record a conversation with Farley on September 18, 2012, with a wiretap hidden in his boot. Suspect: Farley, 46, was charged with trying to hire a hit man to kill her husband and father of her 13 children . On the recording, Farley can allegedly be heard saying that she wanted 'nothing fancy, nothing stupid, nothing traceable'. 'A straight hit, that's what I want,' the woman was allegedly recorded saying. 'One shot - drop him.' 'Rusty' Farley is believed to have been the intended victim of his wife's murder-for-hire plot . When Mr Anderson asked if her husband was abusive, she denied that he was but said she wanted to be free of his strictness and obsession with cleanliness. She added: 'He's out, he's gone, I'm free. Kids can grow up unafraid to be kids.' She said that she had been thinking about killing him for several years. Farley admitted to police that she had cheated on her husband with . other men and used the Internet to research ways to poison him. The . mother-of-13 has been free on $10,000 cash bail since November 2012. Farley is banned from having any contact with her husband . but she is permitted to see her younger children. The couple is separated, according to her defense attorney Peter Rodway. The trial is expected to conclude today.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Killed: Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot and killed by FBI agents in May, more than a month after the Boston Marathon bombing . A Florida prosecutor has cleared an FBI agent of any criminal wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a Chechen man as he was being questioned about a Boston Marathon bombing suspect. Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation said Friday that State Attorney Jeff Ashton won't bring charges against the agent. Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, was killed in Orlando in May while FBI agents and Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Officials originally said Todashev . lunged at an agent with a knife while he was being questioned. They . later said it was no longer clear what happened. Federal . prosecutors have said in court filings that Todashev named Tsarnaev as a . participant in an earlier triple homicide in Massachusetts. The filings . were made in the case against Tsarnaev's brother, surviving bombing . suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. According . to the filings, Todashev told investigators Tamerlan Tsarnaev . participated in a triple slaying in Waltham on September 11, 2011. What did he know: Ibragim Todashev, pictured with his wife, was in the middle of being questioned when he was shot dead . Cleared: Florida prosecutors have chosen not to pursue charges against FBI agents involved in the killing (seen in May after his death) Connections: FBI agents and Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev . In that case, three men were found in an apartment with their necks slit and their bodies reportedly covered with marijuana. One of the victims was a boxer and friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The filing was prosecutors' attempt to . block Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from getting certain information from . authorities, including investigative documents associated with the . Waltham slayings. Authorities . allege that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, and 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, . ethnic Chechens from Russia, planned and carried out the twin bombings . near the finish of the marathon on April 15. Three people were killed . and more than 260 were injured. Dzhokhar . Tsarnaev faces 30 federal charges, including using a weapon of mass . destruction and 16 other charges that carry the possibility of the death . penalty. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gunbattle with police as authorities closed in on the brothers several days after the bombings. The brothers Tsarnaev: Tamerlan (left) died in a gunbattle with police in the days after the Boston bombing and Dzhokhar (right) faces 30 federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty . Scene: The one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing is approaching next month . Both officials spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the case. Ashton's report will be released Tuesday and his  office did not immediately respond Friday to calls and emails seeking comment. The Justice Department also has been investigating but has not yet released its findings. A third law enforcement official said the Justice Department is expected to reach the same conclusion, based on a recommendation from the FBI.","FBI agents killed Ibragim Todashev in Orlando in May when they went to question him about ties to the Boston Marathon bombers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An 11-year-old boy has died after heroically saving his seven-year-old sister from drowning as they swam in a creek in Charlotte, North Carolina. Randez Brown passed away on Thursday night after the incident at Davis Creek and his sister, Samiyah Brown, was listed in critical condition in hospital on Friday morning. On Thursday evening, the siblings had been playing with several other children jumping from rock to rock at a culvert, which authorities said was as deep as 10 ft in some places.

Brave: Eleven-year-old Randez Brown, left, has died after trying to save his seven-year-old sister Samiyah Brown, right, from drowning after she slipped into a North Carolina creek on Thursday night . Samiyah, a second grader, fell into the water and her big brother jumped in after her, friend Breanna Caldwell told the Charlotte Observer. 'I've . been down there,' she said. 'The water is sometimes rushing really . fast out of the pipe. It's muddy and easy to get stuck, especially if . you go too far.' Emergency crews rushed to the scene and firefights pulled one child out at 8pm and the Fire Department's rescue team found another at 10pm, the fire chief told the Observer. The children were rushed to Carolinas Medical Center, but Randez Brown passed away late on Thursday night, officials said. Scene: The children were playing in Davis Creek, which is sheltered by trees and as deep as 10ft . Rescue: The little girl was saved by firefighters and remains in critical condition in hospital . Friends said the fifth-grade student was protective of his little sister. 'If his little sister was in trouble or somebody messed with her, he was there, he really was,' friend Makya Hill told WSOC-TV. Local children often swim in the creek, which is susceptible to flooding, authorities said. A spokeswoman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools said that grief counselors were at Sedgefield Elementary School on Friday to meet with students and staff after the tragedy.

"By . Meghan Keneally . A former spokesman for L'Wren Scott has come to her defense and said that in spite of her debts on the British side of her business, her fashion line was not in trouble at the time of her suicide. 'Her business overall was only seven years old and although some areas of the business had not yet reached their potential other parts of her business were proving successful,' the unidentified spokesman told WWD. Scott was found dead in her Manhattan apartment on Monday and further investigation into her luxury fashion line's finances showed that the British side of her business was thousands of pounds in debt, according to statements provided to UK business regulator Companies House. Scroll down for video . By the numbers: A spokesman for L'Wren Scott's company said that while she may have been in debt on the UK side of her business, that was not grave enough to force her to close her company . Scott never had to file financial disclosure forms for the American side of her business nor her own personal wealth, so the true extent of her financial health is not fully clear. On top of that, her close friend Cathy Horyn wrote in a moving tribute to the 49-year-old designer that she learned after Scott's suicide that she would be announcing the closure of her business this week. The unidentified spokesman said that the numbers were not reflective of the greater picture and she had been planning to rebrand in the coming months in keeping with larger goals. 'In terms of figures shown at Companies House in the UK. The parent company of LS Fashion Limited based in America had made a standard loan investment to the UK subsidiary. LS Fashion Limited is fully able to meet the company’s liabilities and pay all suppliers and customers,' he told WWD on Friday. 'The fact that L’Wren Scott would have been hounded by creditors or riddled with debt is preposterous. Her wares: Scott walks after her Fall 2012 show in New York Fashion week, but she had cancelled her recent show in London due to massive debts though at the time she blamed it on delayed fabrics . Small but selective: Scott's line was a favorite among celebrities like Christy Turlington, Kyra Sedgwick and Ellen Barkin who are seen with her at her 2008 show in New York . 'Ms. Scott was considering a re-structure of her global business.' That said, he did not deny the accuracy of the Companies House figures which showed the business was not profitable in the UK, where she maintained a house and planned to show her collection at London Fashion Week before pulling out at the last minute- citing delayed fabric deliveries. The latest accounts for her business, filed in the UK in October 2013, show that the company, LS Fashion LTD, had a deficit of $5,899,548 (4,237,164 Euros), with the designer owing creditors $7.641 million (euros 5,488,125). However, in recent years, her company’s debts increased on a yearly basis. In 2009, the debt stood at $2,120,015.67, and by 2010 it had grown to $3,063,160.87. She did not file any profit figure, but, because of Companies House guidelines, she would have only been required to do so if the company made more than $10.8million (£6.5million pounds). Designers are regularly paid between $20,000 and $1million for a collaboration with major fashion chains, and an industry source told MailOnline that Scott likely earned around $250,000 for her work with Banana Republic. Support: Jagger was by Scott's side as she unveiled her partnership with Banana Republic in November, which reportedly earned her around $250,000 . Ms Horyn, The New York Times fashion critic and a friend of Scott's since the 1990s, wrote about how she worried about the toll that the stress from the company was taking on Scott, and because she had shut herself away in recent weeks, Ms Horyn was not fully aware of the extent of the trouble. 'I sent her a text on March 12, checking in. She didn’t reply, but that wasn’t unusual. I learned since her death that she was planning to close her business, with an announcement this week. Still, as painful as the decision must have been for her, I wouldn’t draw any conclusions from it about her state of mind,' Ms Horyn wrote in The Times. 'Like many small designers, she had problems managing her business: cash flow, finding the right managers, getting her goods out of Italian factories on schedule.' Back on home turf: The Rolling Stones plane first landed in Los Angeles and has now been spotted in England (pictured) on Friday . Home: Keith Richards was the only main band member seen disembarking in England and Jagger was last known to be in Los Angeles with his children . Though her close friends were concerned that she had been pushing them away in recent months, many outsiders were surprised that money troubles would be one of the factors in her suicide particularly since she was the longterm partner of millionaire Rolling Stone frontman Mick Jagger. She and the rocker had been dating since 2001 when she was working as a stylist and they met on the set of a photo shoot. He was in Australia as the band was due to play seven shows on their '14 On Fire' tour when he learned the news of her death. 'I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way,' he said in a statement released on his website Tuesday.","Unnamed spokesman has said that while her company was in debt in the UK it was just one portion of her business .

"By . Katy Winter . She may be known for her fine, French elegance, but Carla Bruni made sure all eyes were on her by adding some very expensive Italian glamour to her look at a recent event. Wearing a diamond serpent necklace worth £8 million euro, or £6.7 million, the former French first lady was in attendance at the re-opening of the historic shop of jewels, Bulgari, in Via Condotti in Rome. The event took place following restoration works to mark the 130th anniversary of the prestigious jewellers.

Speaking at the time of her delight at being involved with Bulgari, she said: 'In a way, this fine jewellery house is already familiar to me. I feel connected with the romantic history and with its Italian soul which breathes life and joy and I sincerely hope to honour it.' In recognition of their 130th year as one of the best jewellery houses in the world, Bulgari has donated 1.5 million euros to the city of Rome for the restoration of the staircase that connects the Piazza di Spagna with the Trinita dei Monti church.

Carla fronted a campaign for Bulgari in 2013, which included one shot of her wearing a similar necklace to the one she sported last night . Chatting with the Mayor of Rome, Carla looked relaxed and happy, showing no signs of the recent stresses in her life. The 46-year-old was hoping to revive her music career after her husband, former president Nicolas Sarkozy, lost power in France a year and a half ago, but in January she was forced to cancel her planned tour of North America following poor ticket sales.","Attended reopening of historic Bulgari store in Rome .

"By . Candace Sutton . Mick Jagger landed in Los Angeles today to start making funeral preparations for tragic girlfriend L'Wren Scott as the rest of the Rolling Stones returned to Britain.

It remains unclear as to who has the 49-year-old's body, and the plans for where she will be buried have not been released either. Earlier this week, Scott's sister Jan Shane, who hadn't spoken to the designer in nearly six years, told MailOnline that she hoped she would be buried in the family's plot in Ogden, Utah, next to her adoptive parents. The Rolling Stones left Australia, with the group's private plane departing Perth Airport at 2.55pm, with Mick Jagger and his fellow bandmates on board. Jagger, wearing dark sunglasses and black cap, was dropped at the plane's boarding steps as he prepared for his journey home. Pilots lodged a flight plan at Perth airport listing Abu Dhabi as the first destination.

The band left Australia only a few hours after a New York medical examiner ruled that the death of Ms Scott was a suicide. Police confirmed she did not leave a note. Today, Frontier Touring has confirmed it is working on new dates for the . Rolling Stones' Australian tour. Concert promoters said the band's shows . may be held after the football season in either October or November, News.com.au reported.

He had his entourage and security there. He was pretty keen to . just quietly enjoy the music. ‘We had a full house of about 130, and they didn’t really know what was happening. ‘He played a kind-of slow, swing version of Honky Tonk Woman. The place just erupted. People couldn’t believe it.’ Watts had been expected to play at the club earlier in the week as part of saxophonist Tim Ries' Rolling Stones Project when the news of L'Wren Scott’s death altered his plans. Kaitlyn Elsegood, who was at the club, told MailOnline that Watts arrived and took up a spot in a quiet corner, going largely unnoticed by most people. But she said the Stones drummer’s demeanor changed as soon as he hit the stage. ‘He was sitting in the bar the whole time, but he was sitting quietly in the corner having a drink. ‘Not many people noticed he was there. But he was very relaxed on stage. He played for about 45 minutes. ‘He didn’t really say anything. He was just happy to play.’ The Rolling Stones released a statement overnight expressing their support for Jagger, saying 'the death of L'Wren Scott is terrible news and they are pulling together' around the band frontman. The impromptu gig followed Watts telling MailOnline that Mick Jagger had been left dazed and unwell following the apparent suicide on Monday. 'He's holding up. He's okay,' Watts said earlier that night, adding: 'He's not really well. He's not really here. It was such a shock.' Mick Jagger and L'wren Scott walk along the river Thames in London .

"By . David Gardner In Los Angeles . Mick Jagger reportedly left L'Wren Scott behind on the latest Rolling Stones world tour because his bandmates branded her the group's Yoko Ono . Mick Jagger left his girlfriend L’Wren Scott behind on the latest Rolling Stones world tour because his bandmates branded her the group’s Yoko Ono, according to a report in the US. The other Stones allegedly ‘loathed’ the 49-year-old American fashion designer because she was so controlling. ‘When they saw her, they said, “Here comes Yoko”,’ a source told the New York Post. The taunt was a reference to John Lennon’s widow, who was widely blamed for causing the Beatles’ break-up in 1970. Miss Scott was also snubbed by other group members who refused to wear the stage clothes she offered to design for the ‘14 on Fire’ tour which began on February 21 in Abu Dhabi and continued with performances in Tokyo, Macau, Shanghai and Singapore. ‘She ended up designing just Mick’s outfits,’ the insider told the Post. The Australian and New Zealand legs of the tour was cancelled this week after the fashion designer hanged herself in her New York apartment on Monday. Yesterday Sir Mick, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts left Perth, Western Australia, by plane. A grim-faced Jagger, wearing dark sunglasses and black cap, was driven to the boarding steps as he prepared for the journey. After arriving in Los Angeles, he went straight to the home of his daughter Karis, where he was expected to be joined by his other daughters Elizabeth, Georgia May and Jade and son James.His representative said: ‘He will stay in LA while the funeral arrangements are being made in New York.’ In its report the New York Post also claimed the 70-year-old singer, who had dated Miss Scott for 13 years, apparently told her it was better if she did not accompany him this time even though she had travelled with the band for the past decade. The source close to Miss Scott alleged Jagger’s ‘rejection’ must have been ‘a huge blow to her’. On his way to Los Angeles: Mick Jagger (centre in black hat) is pictured here leaving Perth yesterday . This photograph shows Mick Jagger with his bandmates Ronnie Wood, Charlie Watts and Keith Richards . The same newspaper claimed earlier . this week that Jagger had dumped the designer only weeks before leaving . for the tour, an allegation the grief-stricken rocker dismissed as . ‘horrible’ gossip. Last night Jagger’s representative said the claim that Miss Scott was not welcome on the Stones tour was ‘ridiculous’. Miss . Scott had struggled to get along with Jagger’s family, according to the . unnamed source quoted by the Post. ‘She tried really hard to get along . with Mick’s daughters. She was always inviting them to family holiday . dinners, but they just didn’t warm to her. ‘They also thought she was controlling, and that Mick was different, more reserved and less fun, when he was with her.’ The other Stones allegedly 'loathed' the 49-year-old American fashion designer because she was so controlling. 'When they saw her, they said, ""Here comes Yoko"",' a source told the New York Post . The taunt was a reference to John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono (both pictured), who was widely blamed for causing the Beatles' break-up in 1970 . The source also cited the ‘serious financial problems’ faced by the 6ft 3in designer’s company. ‘While the clothes were beautiful, they were really only made to fit someone like her – and not many people look like her,’ they said. ‘Mick had helped her with investment money, but it still wasn’t going anywhere.’ The New York Times revealed yesterday that Miss Scott was planning to announce the closure of her debt-ridden firm on Wednesday. ‘The decision to close her business must have been very sad and humiliating for her,’ the source said. ‘She had a lot of pride. That, combined with being told she couldn’t go on the Stones tour, could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back.’ Miss Scott spent a few days last week in Mustique. On Sunday night, hours before she took her  life in her New York apartment, she had a dinner party for friends. The New York Post claimed the 70-year-old singer apparently told Miss Scott it was better if she did not accompany him this time even though she had travelled with the band for the past decade .

"By . Jonathan Block . Sergeant Woods, joined by an Army and Air Force crew, were on a resupply mission to a U.S. camp in Bu Prang, Vietnam aboard a C-123 Provider when the aircraft came under enemy fire on Oct. 24, 1964. The plane crashed and all seven men aboard, including Woods, perished. While the remains of the other six men were recovered, remains of Sergeant Woods could not be found at the time. Steven Woods cries as he clutches an American flag during a funeral service for his father, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Lawrence Woods, at Arlington National Cemetery on Friday . In December 2009 and January 2010, a joint American and Vietnamese team excavated a site near where the plane has crashed to search for Woods' remains, according to the New York Times. While they found human remains, they could not conclusively identify them as belong to the missing soldier. On Friday, Woods, along with his fellow crew members, were buried in a single coffin as part of group burial. The other soldiers are Air Force Capt. Valmore W. Bourque, Air Force 1st Lt. Robert G. Armstrong, Air Force Staff Sgt. Ernest J. Halvorson, Air Force Staff Sgt. Theodore B. Phillips, Air Force Airman 1st Class Eugene Richardson, Army Pfc. Charles P. Sparks. 'Therefore today, they were all buried in this one ceremony to include Wood,' Lt. Col.

Woods held a framed picture of his father during the service. 'I would like to say “thank you” today to those who have never forgotten, who remember the soldiers and what they do every day,' Szymanski said at the burial, reported the Leaf-Chronicle.  'I would like to thank the people who taught us what those initials mean – Prisoner of War and Missing in Action. We will never forget what you have done for all of us, and we appreciate it.' Although Szymanski never met her father, she said that he instilled pride.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . Two of the three selfie musketeers, David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, were reunited at an EU Summit today. In December, a photograph of President Obama, David Cameron and Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, taken on the Danish President's phone, went viral. The legendary picture was taken during Nelson Mandela's memorial service. But today there were no iPhones in sight and no wide grins on their faces when the pair discussed the topic of Ukraine at an EU summit in Brussels. Then: Barack Obama, David Cameron and Helle Thorning-Schmidt were all smiles when taking a selfie at Nelson Mandela's funeral . Now: There were no smiles on show when David Cameron was reunited with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt today during a signing ceremony with Ukraine at an EU summit in Brussels . Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt arrived with a smile on her face at the European head of states summit. Yet moments later her smile had vanished when engrossed in conversation with David Cameron . Mrs Thorning-Schmidt was no longer all smiles when talking to the Prime Minister . Although Mrs Thorning-Schmidt arrived at the summit with a grin on her face, by the time she had begun speaking to Mr Cameron, that smile had disappeared altogether. After the picture went viral, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said she wanted to delete the image which she described as not particularly good. But instead, Mr Cameron is said to have suggested that it should be auctioned off and that proceeds from the picture go to charity. The meeting today was at a European Union conference where world leaders signed an association agreement in which they agreed to maintain closer relations with Ukraine. The landmark political cooperation accord between the European Union and the Ukraine committed to the same deal former president Viktor Yanukovich rejected last November, a decision that led to his overthrow. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, EU presidents Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso, and the leaders of the bloc's 28 nations signed the core chapters of the Association Agreement during the EU summit in Brussels. Soon afterwards, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation completing the process of absorbing Crimea into Russia, defying Western leaders who say the Black Sea peninsula remains part of Ukraine. Today's deal commits Ukraine and the EU to closer political and economic cooperation. Yet elements concerning free trade will be signed only after Ukraine has held a presidential election on May 25. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, right, looks at his papers as, from second right, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen and Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico applaud during a signing ceremony at an EU summit in Brussels today . Mr Van Rompuy, the European Council president, said the agreement would bring Ukraine and its 46 million people closer to the heart of Europe and a 'European way of life'. '(This) recognises the aspirations of the people of Ukraine to live in a country governed by values, by democracy and the rule of law, where all citizens have a stake in national prosperity,' he said. Two sets of the documents were passed around the table for the EU's leaders and Yatseniuk to sign in a solemn atmosphere. Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Yatseniuk then shook hands and exchanged the documents to applause, witnesses said. Mr Yanukovich turned his back on signing the EU agreement last November in favour of closer ties with Moscow, triggering months of street protests that eventually led to his flight from the country. Soon afterwards, Russian forces occupied Crimea, a Russian-majority region in the far southeast of the country, drawing outrage and sanctions from the United States and EU. European heads of state came together today an an EU summit in Brussels. The Danish President was pictured next to Angela Merkel . Mr Yatseniuk urged European leaders to move decisively to contain Putin with economic pressure or risk the conflict - the most bitter East-West confrontation since the Cold war - spilling elsewhere into Europe. 'The best way to contain Russia is to impose real economic leverage on them,' he told reporters after the signing ceremony. 'I strongly believe ... the EU will speak in one single strong voice, defending the territorial integrity of Ukraine and protecting the EU itself because God knows what is the final destination, is it Ukraine or is it EU?' Yesterday, EU leaders began preparations for economic sanctions if Russia expands its footprint in Ukraine, but no details were given on what measures the bloc would take. Underscoring divisions in Europe, which have hampered its response to the crisis in Ukraine, French President Francois Hollande said late on Thursday that Kiev could count on tightening relations with the EU but not on membership. 'I have always considered that Ukraine should be associated with the EU. It couldn't aspire to be a member of the EU,' he told reporters. Ukraine was part of the Moscow-dominated Soviet Union until 1991 and analysts say Putin considers Ukraine to be within Russia's historical sphere of influence. David Cameron's expression was stern today when arriving at the summit in contrast to Mrs Thorning-Schmidt's wide grin . Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk (right) with David Cameron and Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeld (left) Some European policymakers have pushed the EU to open its doors to countries in the east as an incentive to reform and resist Russian pressure on those states to shun Europe. But many EU governments, wary of goading Russia with which they have had major commercial ties, will not even suggest that Ukraine could one day join the bloc. As well as the closer political ties, the European Commission has agreed to extend nearly 500 million euros (£418 million) worth of trade benefits to Ukraine, removing duties on a wide range of farm goods, textiles and other imports. Once Ukraine has a new administration and signs a free-trade agreement with the European Union, it will have unfettered access to the EU's market of 500 million consumers. That has the potential to strengthen Ukraine's shattered economy, but also runs the risk of provoking retaliatory steps from Russia, which has already imposed stricter customs checks on trade with Ukraine. The other burden for Kiev is meeting the obligations that come with EU political association. These include instituting changes to the rule of law and justice in a country long plagued by corruption and repressive governance, and adopting business and environmental standards that will require hard work and long-term investment to meet.","Cameron reunited with Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt at summit .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Scroll down for video . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s chronic lateness has rubbed reporters the wrong way since his inauguration, but now even children are becoming impatient. A four-year-old child broke protocol and sat down in front of adults standing at the front of a Thursday event where the mayor was almost an hour late to sign his first bill into law, the boy then refused to clap as the bill was signed. Jael Jesus Ramirez is not the first child to have issue with hizzonor’s lack of regard for others’ time, a child infamously passed out waiting for the chronically-late mayor to introduce his new city schools chancellor earlier late last year. He's had enough: Jael Jesus Ramirez, 4, sat down after after Mayor Bill de Blasio (talking at the podium in the background) arrived 45 minutes late to the bill signing . People are informally required to stand at the front of events attended by the mayor, regardless of tardiness. The Mayor’s first few months have been marred by lateness so routine that city hall reporters have taken to calling it ‘de Blasio time’ on social media. WCBS reporter Marsha Kramer, who has covered city hall for decades, said she’s ‘never seen anything like it,’ in a recent report. Event attendees haven’t been much kinder, but none took to sitting down while waiting for the recently-elected mayor until Ramirez plunked himself down as de Blasio spoke about a paid sick leave bill. Soon after Mayor de Blasio finally took his seat, 45 minutes late, Ramirez was seated next to him. Indifferent: Ramirez seems unimpressed with sitting next to the mayor while he signs his first bill into law . The audience ceremoniously clapped as the mayor went through pen after pen, using a different one for each letter of his name, as he signed the bill – all except Ramirez. The young boy looked unimpressed, bored even, and refused to clap while his mother even tried to spur him on. She instead awkwardly raised his arm in the arm as he glanced unhappily in the mayor’s direction.The incident earned an instant classic headline from the New York Post. ‘Sit happens! Kid can’t ‘stand’ wait for chronically late de Blasio.’ An expert told WCBS that de Blasio’s traveling ‘late show,’ as the Post put it, will negatively affect public perception. ‘There’s no question that if you are late that it affects your reputation and that people lose their ability to trust you, especially in politics, especially when you’re in public office’ psychologist Dr Harris Stratyner told the station. A growing problem: A child passed out late last year while waiting for the tardy mayor-elect to announce his new schools chancellor . When asked by Kramer if he thinks reports about ‘de Blasio time’ are unfair, the mayor seemed unamused. ‘You know, Marcia, I think the important this is when you get elected to do a job like this, responsible for 8.4 million people with every conceivable subject matter, my job is to do the best for the people,’ said de Blasio. ‘That’s what matters,’ he continued. ‘The rest is noise.’ Not everyone agrees. ‘Bill de Blasio is always running so late, he probably still hasn't moved his clocks back an hour,’ Eric Dixon wrote on Twitter. Another person lampooned reports last month the mayor was speeding stop signs and red lights. ‘Imagine how late he would have been if he didn’t speed and run stop signs to get there,’ tweeted Scott Goldberg. Dr Stratyner had some great advice for helping de Blasio show up on-time to events ‘by investing in a good watch and setting it ahead one hour.'","Recently-elected New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has made a habit of showing up late for official events .

"By . James  Nye . Seattle police have released two never-before-seen images taken at the scene of Kurt Cobain's death after they announced they were re-examining evidence in the two decade-old case. One of the tragic photographs, which comes from four rolls of undeveloped film stumbled upon last month, shows a small cigar box containing a spoon, possibly with heroin residue on it, needles and a lighter laying on the floor next to a cigarette butt and a pair of dark sunglasses. The second picture shows the box closed, next to cash, a woolly hat and an open wallet that appears to display Cobain's ID. Scroll down for video . New evidence: A police handout photo released on March 20, 2014 by Seattle Police Department shows articles left at grunge rock musician Kurt Cobain's 1994 death scene . Potential leads? This picture shows the box containing drug paraphernalia closed, next to cash, a hat and a wallet that displays what looks like Cobain's ID . Detective Renee Witt, a spokeswoman for the Seattle Police Department, revealed Thursday that . detectives were taking a second look at the circumstances surrounding . the Nirvana star's suicide after the new evidence was uncovered. The rolls of film were found in sealed bags by an officer who was going through Cobain's case file ahead of the approaching 20th anniversary of the singer's death. The images are said to detail the scene in sharper detail than the Polaroid pictures used in the original 1994 investigation causing police to review all evidence. However, authorities have stopped short of declaring a full re-opening of the case and police are reluctant to suggest much will come from the new photos. New evidence: Police in Seattle have announced that new photographs of the scene of Kurt Cobain's suicide have been uncovered and developed . Scene: A police officer stands guard on the back porch of Kurt Cobain's garage where Cobain's body was found early 08 April 1994 in Seattle, WA, after an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound . The Nevermind star was discovered . dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home near Lake . Washington by electrician Gary Smith, who raised the alarm. The . Seattle chief medical examiner ruled that Cobain, who was 27 at the . time, had ended his own life three days earlier after leaving a rehab . facility for heroin addiction. Authorities . recovered a note, but speculation has been rife since that the Smells . Like Teen Spirit singer did not commit suicide. Indeed, . the 1998 documentary Kurt and Courtney by filmmaker Nick Broomfield . infamously made allusions to Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. Close up: The spoon appears to show leftover white power . Better detail: The police say the images are clearer than Polaroids used in the original investigation . Identification: One picture shows an open wallet containing what appears to be Cobain's ID . No evidence has ever been found that the Hole singer was in any way responsible for the rock icon's death. Authorities initially ruled Cobain's death a suicide and said he had taken a lethal dose of heroin prior to shooting himself. Since his band rocketed to fame in the early 1990s, Cobain had struggled to deal with the public perceptions of him and suffered depression and battled addiction. According to local Seattle station KIRO, authorities developed four rolls of 35mm film found last month by the King County Sheriff's Office photo lab under high security. Detective Renee Witt, a spokesperson for . the Seattle Police, told the Washington Post the pictures have a slight green tint because of deterioration but still reveal more than the original polaroids. KIRO reported that the image of Cobain's dead . body will never be released. As Nirvana fans across the globe went wild with speculation that police were to officially reopen the investigation into his death, Seattle police were quick to clarify the pictures and the status of the case. 'Despite an erroneous news report, we have not 'reopened' the investigation into the suicide of Kurt Cobain,' the Seattle Police Department tweeted from a verified account. The police went on to explain on Twitter . that the case was simply being reviewed in anticipation of the 20th . anniversary of Cobain's untimely death. Almost 20 years to the day speculation still rages amongst Nirvana fans as to the circumstances surrounding Kurt Cobain's death. His death certificate stated that he died as a result of a 'contact perforating shotgun wound to the head', and concluded it a suicide. However here are the leading theories that have grown up around his death . Homicide: . Lack of blood at the scene: Seattle public access host Richard Lee obtained a video taped from outside Cobain's garage looking into his house. The scene around the body showed what Lee claimed was a distinct lack of blood for a point-blank shotgun blast to the head. Toxicology report: The . official pathology report determined that the level of heroin in . Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter - a potentially . lethal dose. Young: This 1993 file photo shows lead singer of Nirvana Kurt Cobain who was just 27 when he died . However, . private investigator Tom Grant - who worked for Courtney Love - has . pointed out that meant Cobain could have been too high to even be able . to pull the trigger. Furthermore, . Grant argues that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain . before the shotgun was fired by the perpetrator of the homicide. Suicide note: . Grant claims that while he was working for Courtney Love he came across . the suicide note that Cobain wrote for Courtney Love. He . believes that the letter reads as a note announcing he is leaving his . wife and the music business - not as a farewell to life. He claims the final few lines at the bottom - which do imply suicide - were added afterwards by an unknown individual. The shotgun: The gun that the . singer used to kill himself, a Remington Model 11 20 gauge, was not . checked for fingerprints until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint . Analysis Report, four cards of latent prints were lifted but contained . no legible prints. Nick . Broomfield: The filmmaker's controversial film, Kurt and . Courtney made the claim that Courtney Love paid for a hit on her . husband's life. However, . in  a 1998 interview, Broomfield said, 'I think that . he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a smoking gun.' Suicide: . Many of Cobain's friends and family have noted the singer's private and public utterances of depression and instability. They noted his struggles with addiction and what they believe was an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. They . point to a previous suicide attempt in Rome in and bandmate's Krist . Novoselic and Dave Grohl all believe he sadly took his own life. Suicide note: Cobain did leave a suicide note, pictured, at the scene. This picture of the note was released years ago . 'Our detective reviewed the case file anticipating questions surrounding the closed Cobain case as the 20 yr anniversary approaches,' another tweet explained. Detective Witt later told NBC News: 'There was nothing . earth-shattering in any of these images.' Speaking to KIRO on April 8, 1994, electrician Smith said that as he walked into the Nirvana legend's home  'I noticed something on the floor and I thought it was a mannequin. 'So I looked a little closer and geez, that's a person. I looked a little closer and I could see blood and an ear and a weapon laying on his chest.' Stunned, he said that he could recall seeing the suspected suicide note ontop of soil in the home's greenhouse. 'I only read the bottom lines,' he said 'the bottom two lines said, 'I love you, I love you' to someone.' Conspiracy theories: Kurt Cobain of and wife Courtney Love holding daughter Frances Bean Cobain - Nirvana fans have often tried to implicate Love in her husbands death - all these theories have been refuted by authorities . Legends: This 1991 file photo shows the band Nirvana, from left, Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Kurt Cobain. Nirvana will be inducted into the 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014, at the Barclays Center in New York . Two weeks before his suicide, a police report detailed how officers had been called to his Seattle home after Cobain had locked himself in his bathroom and threatened to kill himself. The report said that at the time, police were told 'he had a gun in the room.' However, Cobain had told police he was not suicidal, but in the aftermath of his death they immediately ruled suicide. More than 7,000 mourners packed Seattle Center two days later for a public memorial, where a recording was played of Love reading Cobain's suicide note. Last year, a Seattle police department spokeswoman said the department gets at least one request per week to reopen the investigation, mostly through Twitter. Police have said no other Seattle police case has received similar attention over two decades, reports KIRO.

"By . Sam Creighton . The live wasp was found in the £2 salad bag bought at a store in Hove, East Sussex . A heavily pregnant woman with a wasp allergy feared for the safety of her unborn child after finding one of the insects in her ready-to-eat Tesco salad. Hannah Bull, 28, who gave birth at 4am this morning to a healthy baby girl called Gracie, was halfway through the £2 'Bright Salad Bowl' when she spotted the insect lurking in the leaves. The mother, who was 39-weeks pregnant when she was eating the salad on Wednesday, was 'terrified' at the thought of what damage a sting could do to her and her baby. When Mrs Bull was previously bitten on the hand by a wasp, her fingers swelled and she developed a rash all over her body that lasted for several days. Her husband, Ben Bull, 29, believes his wife's throat would have swelled up, making  it difficult to breathe, if she been stung while swallowing the stray insect. He said: 'A snail or slug I can live with, but for something than can actually cause damage to be in a salad is terrifying. 'It could swell your throat closed and become hard to breath. I wouldn't want that for anyone, especially a pregnant woman or kids. 'This wasp had a wing and legs missing. Hannah jumped up, felt physically sick, and almost gave birth. 'Had she been stung, it could have harmed her and our baby.' The couple, who both work as customer service advisers at an insurance firm, bought the salad from a store near their home in Brighton, Sussex, two days before the incident. They said the wasp initially appeared to be dead but suddenly came back to life. During the incident, Mrs Bull tweeted: 'I just went to show my husband the salad wasp and it's only just come alive!!!! That makes it sooo much worse!!' Hannah Bull, pictured with husband Ben, was heavily pregnant when eating the salad but has since given birth . After finding the insect, Ben phoned Tesco's customer service helpline and an adviser asked them to bring in the salad for investigation. Tesco offered to refund the item and give the couple a £5 voucher as a gesture of goodwill. However, Mrs Bull posted on her Twitter account: 'My pregnant stomach can't handle things like this! I won't be buying salads from tesco! #dissatisfiedcustomer' And then again later, saying: 'I don't want an exchange! I don't intend on buying fresh salads from yourself again! Washed and ready to eat it certainly isn't!!' A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our food so we were concerned to hear of this incident. 'We are currently investigating and will keep Mr Bull informed of our findings. 'We have also offered him a gesture of goodwill for any inconvenience.'","Hannah Bull, 28, found the wasp in the £2 ready-to-eat salad bag .

"By . Mark Duell . Thailandâ€™s general election last month has been declared invalid by a court, it was revealed today. The ruling over the election on February 2 will further delay the formation of a new government after months of street protests aimed at bringing down Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Elections were not held in 28 constituencies, where anti-government protesters had prevented candidates registering - but the constitution says they should be held on the same day nationwide. Scroll down for video . Division: Thailand caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra sits in a wheelchair - after injuring her ankle - as she arrives for a cabinet meeting at the Police Academy in Sam Phran, Nakhon Pathom, on Tuesday . Making themselves heard: An anti-government protester waves a Thai national flag during a rally at the Shinawatra building in central Bangkok last week . Polling was disrupted by protesters in around a fifth of constituencies, leaving the House of Representatives without a quorum to convene and select a new prime minister. It is the latest chapter in an eight-year crisis putting Bangkok's royalist establishment and middle class against supporters of Miss Shinawatra and her brother, ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra. Mr Shinawatra was toppled by the army in 2006 and lives in exile to avoid a jail term for graft. Now in their fifth month, the protesters have shut government offices and at times blocked major thoroughfares in Bangkok to try to force out Miss Shinawatra. Camouflage: Thai soldiers take up duty at a bunker near the protest site of Lumpini park in Bangkok . Demonstrations: Anti-government protesters dismantle the sandbag barriers, blocking the flyover road on the street near their protesting site of Lumpino park in Bangkok, Thailand, on Tuesday . Upset: Angry residents yell at police and officials protesting against not being able to cast their ballot as many polling stations were blocked by protesters during the general elections on February 2 in Bangkok . Some 23 people have died and hundreds have been injured in the violence. Miss Shinawatra called the election in December to try to defuse the protests and since then has headed a caretaker government with limited powers. The violence and political paralysis has dented confidence, prompting cuts to economic growth forecasts. Miss Shinawatra's Puea Thai Party had been expected to win. But the main opposition Democrat Party threw in its lot with the protesters and has demanded electoral changes before any vote, aimed at reducing the influence of Mr Shinawatra. Parties led by or allied to him have won every election since 2001. The judges voted 6-3 to declare the February vote unconstitutional, but it was unclear when a new vote would be held.","Ruling over last month's election will delay formation of new government .

"By . Chris Pleasance . David Reid, 50, has been jailed for six years after admitting conning friends and vulnerable people out of £3.5million . A 'cold-hearted' conman who lived the high-life on cash taken from vulnerable investors in a £3.5million fraud has been jailed. David Reid splashed out on fast cars, a boat, spent thousands on restaurants and hotels, took foreign ski holidays and funded his shooting hobby using money from friends who trusted him with their savings. Newcastle Crown Court heard that, in one case, a little boy with special needs lost out on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Disney Land when he family were conned. In total Reid, who posed as a solicitor and former Olympic shooter, conned 50 victims who lost their homes, life savings, and pensions through the Washington Mortgage Company. Judge James Goss QC yesterday sentenced the 50-year-old, who claimed to be a Labour party member, to six years behind bars. The judge told him: 'This involves over £3.5million which was spent on good living. 'Many offences were committed against older and entirely trusting, decent people, some of whom in vulnerable situations by reason of ill health or other circumstances including bereavement. 'They were cruelly deceived by your false veneer of professionalism and reassurances. They have suffered financially, some ruinously, and emotionally. 'Personal statements reveal the devastating consequences for them and their families of your gross breaches of trust.' Reid was described by one of his victims as a 'very clever and affable' man who wore Saville Row suits and would impress potential investors with £10,000 parties at his home, where fairground rides and clay pigeon shooting would be put on for the guests. Prosecutor David Dixon told the court: 'He was a plausible conman for a period in excess of 10 years, obtaining funds from people who knew him, were referred to him and who had been to his business premises in the Galleries. 'He set up a carefully crafted, professionally operated fraud.' The court heard Reid used forged documents to convince his clients their money was invested safely in offs-shore accounts through the Abbey National and later Santander. When his scam was uncovered by a client he duped in 2003 the police were informed yet no prosecution followed and he continued to trade. Reid hosted £10,000 parties at his house for investors with fairground rides and clay pigeon shooting to make them feel secure, while actually spending their cash on cars, a boat, luxury hotels and fine dining . The court heard many of his victims had considered themselves friends of the fraudster and found they had lost everything through listening to his advice. Mr Dixon added: 'The crown say it was particularly cold-hearted, he was callous in the way he offended. 'It was a clear case of greed. He spent £1,000 on dog bills, £11,500 on skiing holidays, £14, 000 on restaurants and hotels, £6,000 on shooting and £55,000 to pay off credit cards. 'Over the years he has had the benefit of nice cars including Mercedes Benz, a Range Rover, Audi and at one stage had a boat. 'It is difficult to say where all the money has gone. Very little, if any, will remain.' The court heard one widower lost £300,000 his late wife had left as an inheritance for her family's future. Trevor Lazaro, 50, from County Durham, turned to Reid, who he had thought was a friend, to help with financial affairs when his wife Linda lost her battle with cancer. Widower Lazaro, of Burnhope, County Durham, described how Reid groomed his family for several years, knowing that his wife Linda has cancer - and that she had a large insurance policy of £300,000. As a result of taking the conman's advice Mr Lazario, who has a child with downs syndrome, has been forced to put the family home on the market. He said: 'The defendant has stolen my family money, stolen my future and my children's futures, as well as make a fool out of me and our friendship. 'Most of the money was left for the long-term care of my eldest daughter, who has Down's syndrome. That is gone now. 'He never had the common decency to come and apologise. He appears to show no remorse whatsoever for his actions. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Reid's 50 victims lost their homes, life savings and pensions and in one case a boy with down's syndrome missed out on a once-of-a-lifetime trip to Disney Land when his parents were duped . 'He is nothing more than a common thief, preying on the sick and the vulnerable.'Another victim who said Reid had given a eulogy at her late husband's funeral and helped her sort out financial necessities while she was grieving. She later realised he had conned her out of more than £30,000. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it was like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. 'I felt totally lost, like a bereavement all over again. My husband went to his grave thinking I was financially set for the rest of my life. 'I have no trust left in anyone anymore.' The court heard Reid confessed during police interviews there were more than 50 victims. Some payments were made from the accounts but a total loss of more than £1.6million remains outstanding and is unlikely to be recovered. Jamie Adams, defending, said Reid is 'sorry' for what he did and had not set out deliberately to make people lose money. Mr Adams said Reid has tried to kill himself twice and feels real shame and remorse for what he has done. He added: 'He was not setting out for people to lose money, that was not the objective here. 'He became over-confident and thought he could play the system. He was playing the markets because he had large sums of money available to him. Reid, from Burnhope, County Durham, pleaded guilty to 22 charges of . obtaining a money transfer by deception and one of participating in a . fraudulent business.","David Reid, 50, posed as an investor for friends and vulnerable people .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A young Chinese woman named Song Ying who sang to her mother everyday is rejoicing after she she finally came out of a 600-day coma. Doctors were amazed when they heard that Chinese woman Hu Xuehong, 47, had woken up after almost two years in a coma after her daughter Song Ying, 24, gave up her job as an accountant to care for her. Asked what she had done the young woman said that apart from feeding and bathing her mother, she had also been singing a popular Chinese children song called: 'Mum is best'. A young Chinese woman named Song Ying who sang to her mother everyday is rejoicing after she she finally came out of a 600-day coma . Doctors were amazed when they heard that Chinese woman Hu Xuehong, 47, had woken up after almost two years in a coma after her daughter Song Ying, 24, gave up her job as an accountant to care for her . Hu Xuehong had collapsed after a brain hemorrhage in 2012 at the town of Guankou, in the county of Sishui in central China's Hubei province. Her daughter had graduated as an accountant at the start of that year and had immediately landed a job, but only three months later she had to give it up on hearing that her mother had been taken sick. She said: 'I had a call from a neighbour who said she had been suffering from a pain in the chest and had been feeling very sick. Her daughter had graduated as an accountant at the start of that year and had immediately landed a job, but only three months later she had to give it up on hearing that her mother had been taken sicK . Hu Xuehong had collapsed after a brain hemorrhage in 2012 at the town of Guankou, in the county of Sishui in central China's Hubei province . Asked what she had done the young woman said that apart from feeding and bathing her mother, she had also been singing the nursery rhyme that her mother had sunk to her so much as a child . 'By the time she was at the hospital she was unconscious and diagnosed with cerebral haemorrhage. She was operated on for seven hours and I was hopeful that she would then survive, but she never woke up.' It was not possible for them to remain in the hospital and it was also impossible for the 51-year-old father to care for her at the family's modest home. She said: 'As a family we decided that my father would carry on working, and I would give up my job to care for my mother as this was a full-time occupation. The medical fees have cost us 200,000 RMB (£20,000) and my sister is still working so that we can try to pay those. 'I had a lot to do looking after my mother but whenever I wasn't busy with chores I would sit by her bed and sing the song. 'It was her birthday on 21 March, and we bought a cake and lit the candles and then me and my sister and father sang her favourite song again – only this time as I was holding her hand I felt the grip tighten. 'I couldn't believe she was squeezing my hand and then seconds later she opened her eyes and smiled at me. It's the first time she has seen the light of day in 600 days.' Doctors say that the chances of anyone coming round after such a long length of time is extremely unlikely and have suggested that the woman's frequent singing reached through to her mother and helped her to wake. Song added: 'I never gave up on my mum, now we need to concentrate on getting her back on her feet.'","Hu Xuehong, 47, had collapsed after a brain hemorrhage in 2012 .

"By . Brendan Carlin . 'Nasty Nick' tried to poison Dot in EastEnders to take her pension money, and a Labour MP has warned that new pension rules could mean similar fraud becomes much more common . Ed Miliband faced anger last night after Labour officially backed George Osborne’s pensions revolution. Labour rebels claimed letting the elderly cash in big pension pots instead of buying annuities – incomes for life – could lead to some running out of money. And senior Labour MP Austin Mitchell said he feared it could see unscrupulous relatives or fraudsters preying on those who cash in pensions. Mr Mitchell, 79, said he was worried it could result in threats similar to the EastEnders storyline in which ‘Nasty Nick’Cotton tried to poison his mother Dot to get her money. The row erupted after Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Rachel Reeves announced Labour would not reverse the pensions shake-up. But Labour sources claimed a ‘substantial number’ of its MPs, including Shadow Ministers, were opposed to the decision. ‘This is a mistake and I’m sure many Labour colleagues share that view,’ said Great Grimsby MP Mr Mitchell. ‘The Government shouldn’t have done it and we shouldn’t be supporting them. It could open the way to more old people facing attempts to con them – just like Dot Cotton.’ A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday showed voters have similar concerns. Six out of ten are worried it could increase the risk of fraudsters preying on the elderly. However, there is strong overall support for letting people cash in pensions. More than one in three Tories said they are more likely to vote for Mr Cameron as a consequence. And they backed Lib Dem Pensions Minister Steve Webb in the so-called ‘Lamborghini dilemma’. Mr Webb came under fire for saying people who picked up a pension windfall were entitled to ‘blow it’ on a Lamborghini. Approval: More than one in three Tories are more likely to vote for David Cameron because of the policy, and backed Steve Webb MP who said pensioners should be able to blow their savings however they wanted . But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was concerned about pensioners misusing their funds. Asked who they backed, half supported Mr Webb and a third agreed with Mr Balls. On pension pot priorities, personal investment came top, followed by paying off home loans and debts; helping children and grandchildren with house deposits or student fees; dream holidays and cars, with annuities in last place. Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins said the pensions reforms could store up problems, warning that many people could end up in ‘relative penury’. One Shadow Minister said: ‘There’s been no consultation – just a surprise announcement from Rachel Reeves on the radio. The Tory plan is just a tax avoidance scheme for the wealthy, but why is Labour charging down that path?’ The row came as the Prime Minister hailed the ‘success’ of the Government’s Help to Buy’ scheme, which allows people to buy a home with as little as a five per cent deposit. The scheme, extended to 2020 in last week’s Budget, has so far helped 17,000 buy a home.","George Osborne made pension reform part of his budget this week .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Lance Armstrong appeared to be putting fitness first on his list of New Year's resolutions after he was spotted paddle-boarding with his bikini-clad girlfriend in Hawaii this week. It seemed like strenuous workouts were in need for the disgraced cyclist, 42, who showed off a bit of a paunch as he paddled shirtless in the tropical waters. Armstrong was joined by his 32-year-old girlfriend Anna Hansen who looked incredible in a tiny, black two piece. The couple were enjoying a beach day on Monday with their two children and Armstrong's three children from his previous marriage. Lance Armstrong looked toned and healthy while paddle-boarding with his family in Hawaii on January 6 . Anna Hansen, 31, has two children with Armstrong after they began dating in 2008 . The blended family enjoyed water sports and a spot of sunbathing, with one of Armstrong's older daughters helping his youngest son build sandcastles. Armstrong began dating Anna Hansen in July 2008 after they met through his charity work. Five months later, he announced that Miss Hansen was pregnant, having conceived naturally. At the time, it was believed that Armstrong could no longer father children after having battled testicular cancer in 1996 and undergone chemotherapy. Their son Maxwell Edward Armstrong was born in 2009. A daughter, Olivia Marie, followed in October 2010. Armstrong has three children after using IVF with his ex-wife Kristin Richard. The couple married in 1998 and have three children Luke David, 14, and 12-year-old twins Isabelle Rose and Grace Elisabeth. The pregnancies were possible following the sperm Armstrong banked prior to his cancer treatment The couple divorced in 2003.

He dated designer Tory Burch from March to October 2007. In 2012, Armstrong was banned from competitive cycling and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles over his admitted use of performance-enhancing drugs. After years of denials, Armstrong admitted last January that he had in fact used performance enhancing drugs during a much-hyped interview with Oprah Winfrey. The confession came after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report detailed widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by Armstrong and his USPS team. Armstrong appeared relaxed during his beach vacation despite the fact that this week cycling's governing body appointed a three-man independent panel to investigate the sport's doping past, including allegations the UCI colluded with the athlete. Armstrong tweeted on Tuesday that he planned to cooperate with the UCI commission but that he had yet to be contacted by the organization.

Susan Edwards, 55, and husband Christopher, 57, denied murdering William and Patricia Wycherley at an earlier court hearing. But during a plea hearing at Nottingham Crown Court, the couple each pleaded guilty to two charges of obstructing the coroner in the execution of his duty and the theft of a credit balance. Court: Susan and Christopher Edwards deny murdering her parents but admit obstructing the coroner in the course of her duty . The Wycherleys disappeared from their semi-detached house in Mansfield in 1998.

"By . John Hall . The father of Chelsea captain John Terry has been cleared of racist abuse at the Old Bailey. Ted Terry, 59, had been accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette. Speaking outside court Terry said he felt 'relieved' at the verdict and was now going home to call his footballer son. Not guilty: Ted Terry pictured outside the Old Bailey after being cleared of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a 'f****** P***' in a drunken row over a cigarette . Cleared: A jury of seven men and five women took an hour and 20 minutes to find Ted Terry (right) not guilty of one count of racially-aggravated common assault on Amarjit Talafair (left) after a five-day trial . Embrace: Ted Terry put on a public display of relief after being cleared of racist abuse at the Old Bailey . He told reporters : 'I'm just going home and I'm going to phone John up', before hugging his co-defendants. 'It's been a hard year for all of us. We all felt it was nothing, really. It was stupid,' he added. A jury of seven men and five women took an hour and 20 minutes to find Terry not guilty of one count of racially-aggravated common assault after a five-day trial. Terry, from Grays in Essex, was also cleared of one count of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence. Terry's colleagues, former schoolboy boxing champion Stephen Niland, 36, from Romford in Essex, and Moldova-born Tudor Musteata, 47, from Greenwich in south east London, were also found not guilty of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence. Niland was in tears as he left the dock and Terry also appeared wet around the eyes as he spoke of his relief at the verdicts with reporters. Relief: Speaking outside court Ted Terry said he felt 'relieved' at the verdict and was now going home to call his son - Chelsea captain John . Ted Terry's co-defendant Tudor Musteata hugs family members outside court after being cleared this afternoon . Defence barristers argued that the prosecution's witnesses all knew each other and had conspired together to back up the racist abuse claims. Mr Talafair said that he had suffered no injury from Terry's alleged headbutt because he was able to get out of the way in time and admitted calling the defendant a 'fat bald p****' during the stand-off. The complainant reported the incident to police the following day after researching Terry online. He asked officers about taking his story to the press, but was told it would hamper the investigation, the court heard. The confrontation started after a dispute over a cigarette outside The Windsor pub near Fenchurch Street station in London. Both Terry and Mr Talafair's groups had been drinking in the pub to celebrate birthdays, the court heard. Terry admitted having seven or eight pints of beer, while Mr Talafair drunk around six single shots of Jack Daniel's bourbon with cola. Co-defendants: Stephen Niland (left) and Tudor Musteata (right) hug their respective families after being cleared at the Old Bailey this afternoon . Ted Terry's colleagues, former schoolboy boxing champion Stephen Niland, 36, (pictured) and Moldova-born Tudor Musteata were also found not guilty of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence . Giving evidence, Terry admitted putting his face against Mr Talafair's and calling him a 'f***** tight p****', but denied headbutting him or saying ""f****** P***, let's have it right here and now'. The father of two and grandfather of six told the jury: 'I just said 'f*** off, go back downstairs', things like that. It wasn't no racist stuff.' The jury of seven men and five women heard that the Chelsea captain's father received a 24-month conditional discharge for common assault in 2005 and a suspended prison sentence for an offence of supplying class A drugs in 2010. Two months after being arrested for racially aggravated assault in March last year, Terry admitted racially abusing another man. He was fined £200 for saying 'f****** Irish p****' during an argument at Barking rail station, the court heard. Ted Terry appearance today at the Old Bailey, where he was acquitted of a racist attack, is the latest in a string of scandals to strike the Terry family over the years. In 2010 Terry was given a suspended prison sentence and 100 hours' community service after he admitted supplying drugs. He had been caught on camera handing over three wraps of cocaine for £120 by an undercover reporter in a bar in Essex. He told the reporter, who posed as a chauffeur buying the drugs for his wealthy boss: 'The stuff 's all right. I get off on it.' He added: 'This is just between me and you. Don't tell him that I'm John Terry's dad.' John Terry's mother Sue has also run into trouble with the law. In 2009 she was caught shoplifting £800 of shopping from Tesco and Marks & Spencer. She was arrested along with the footballer's mother-in-law Sue Poole after shop attendants noticed them walking out of a store in Weybridge, Surrey, with a shopping trolley filled with shoes, clothes and even pet food. Terry and Poole accepted a caution from officers after being caught, which would have been put on both women's criminal records. A police spokesman said at the time: 'Cautions are usually applied for more minor matters or when it is a first time offence. A caution represents an admission of guilt and forms part of a criminal record.' John Terry has also found himself in court on race charges. He was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers on the football pitch in October 2011. Prosecutors said Terry swore and used the word 'black' of Mr Ferdinand. He was cleared of the charge, but a later hearing by the Football Association still imposed a £220,000 fine and a four-match ban. Their verdict said that Terry had been found guilty of 'using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand and which included a reference to colour and/or race.' In 2010 he was also exposed by the Daily Mail for touting his personal box at Wembley Stadium for £4,000 a match. The terms of the perk, which he received as then England football captain, specifically forbade Terry from hiring the box out, but an undercover reporter was offered use of it by one of Terry's go-betweens. Shortly after the revelations, coupled with an ongoing controversy about attempts to cover up an extra-martial affair, he was sacked as England captain by Fabio Capello.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Questions were being raised tonight after a football referee mistakenly showed a red card to the wrong black player during today's Arsenal-Chelsea game. Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs was sent off the pitch after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handled the ball on the goal-line during the Gunners' 6-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. This caught the eyes of TV pundits who questioned if referee Andre Marriner was being racist and could not tell the difference between the two young black players. Mistaken identity: Gibbs (left) is shown a red card despite Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's handball . Admission: Oxlade-Chamberlain even approached Marriner to tell him it was he who handled the ball . The reactions on Twitter followed hard and fast, with several posting that Gibbs had been sent off for 'being black'. Despite . Oxlade-Chamberlain telling referee Andre Marriner several times that it . was he who touched the ball, the referee maintained Gibbs should leave, . ordering a penalty for Chelsea. During . the half-time analysis on BT Sport, former Arsenal striker Ian Wright . says: ‘What is he[referee] saying, that they both look the same?’ Fellow pundit Steve McManaman replies: ‘Is he [Marriner] being racist?’ The . former Liverpool winger was scathing in his assessment: ‘The collection . of errors by the officials — I mean, it’s a shambles.’ Sports site SBNation . also questioned the referee's decision, saying Gibbs and . Oxlade-Chamberlain were 'pretty different looking chaps with one obvious . similarity a veteran referee should be able to see through'. Oxlade-Chamberlain, . who dived on the line to get a hand to Eden Hazard's effort from eight . yards, admitted to referee Andre Marriner that it was himself who should . have been penalised, saying: 'Ref, it was me!' The winger's handball was intentional but unnecessary, with the ball going wide even without the touch. And . despite Gibbs' protestations, the left-back decided to depart the field . before Chelsea went 3-0 up courtesy of Hazard's penalty was converted. Arsenal . may not appeal the decision to . free up Oxlade-Chamberlain for the visit of Swansea on Tuesday, but the . FA can appeal themselves to ensure the right person is punished. Referee Marriner reportedly admitted at half-time that it was his own mistake, not the linesman's. This . was Marriner's first game at Stamford Bridge since he awarded Chelsea a . controversial late penalty for Steven Reid's challenge on Ramires in . West Brom's 2-2 draw with the Blues in November. It . is a situation, however, that Pedro Pinto, the chief of press for . Platini, said would not have happened under UEFA's policy to employ an . extra referee on the by-line. Not needed: The handball was intentional but not necessary, with the ball going wide . The wrong man: Oxlade-Chamberlain protests with the referee, telling him 'It was me' Why me? Gibbs looks frustrated as he departs the pitch after being sent off . Aware: Oxlade-Chamberlain looks guilty after handling the ball on the goal-line . Pinto . wrote on Twitter: 'What confusion at Chelsea-Arsenal with the pen . decision. That's why over 30 European countries have endorsed . UEFA-backed 5 officials system. 'With an additional assistant referee . on the end line, referee would not have got that sending off wrong. Technology is not the answer...' Pinto claimed that 'more eye balls' were the key to improving referee decision-making rather than technology alone. The . Barclays Premier League has employed goal-line technology for the first . time this season - which would not have aided Marriner's decision at . Chelsea because it determines whether a shot has crossed the line only. Pinto . added on Twitter: 'More eye balls are the answer. GLT helps with goal . line decisions, but five officials system gives referee more angles of . vision. It's not one vs the other.'","Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs given red card after a teammate handled the ball .

"By . Sara Malm . A Sikh man has been jailed for ten years after being convicted of attempting to assassinate a former Indian military lieutenant general in 2012. Lakhbir Singh, 26, is the latest, and final, person to be imprisoned over the attack, with three men and one woman already serving time. Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, 78, and his wife Meena were holidaying in London when they were ambushed in ‘revenge’ over a military operation that took place in Punjab more than 30 years ago. Retired Indian soldier Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar survived a terrorist attack in London last September. Four men ambushed him and his wife Meena, slicing his throat before stabbing him in the jaw . Last year, Harjit Kaur, 39, Dilbag . Singh, 37, Mandeep Singh Sandu, 34, and 33-year-old Barjinder Sangha . were all jailed between 10.5 and 14 years for their part in the attack . while Lakhbir Singh remained at large. He . was arrested last month after handing himself into a local police . station in Ascoli, Italy and was taken in by Italian authorities in . connection with the attack. Sing was handed ten years in prison for grievous bodily harm with intent at Southwark Crown Court today. The . four men attacked Lt Gen Brar in London, in front of his wife, after . Kaur, girlfriend of Dilbag Singhhad fed them information about his . whereabouts. It was planned . in retaliation for a controversial military raid - Operation Blue Star - . led by Lt. General Brar on the sacred Golden Temple of Amritsar in . north west India in 1984. Mandeep Singh Sandhu (left), from London, and Dilbag Singh (right), from Birmingham, have each been jailed for 14 years after a jury found them guilty of wounding with intent . Harjit Kaur (left), from London, was jailed for 11 years after a jury found her guilty of wounding with intent. Barjinder Singh Sangha, (right), from Wolverhampton, had already admitted the charge and was jailed to 10 years and six months for his part in the attack on Lt. General Brar . The men, tipped off by Kaur, followed Lt. General Brar and his wife as they returned to the Mostyn Hotel in Marble Arch. Sangha grabbed Mrs Brar by the throat and hurled her against a wall in nearby Old Quebec Street. When Lt. General Brar intervened, Sangha sliced his throat and stabbed him in the jaw, as the other men held him down. The . retired soldier, who served in the Indian army for 40 years, was taken . to St Mary's Hospital on September 30, 2012 but survived the attack. At the time fo the sentencing of the other four defendants, . Judge Jeffrey Pegden said: ‘I . am of the view that the attackers wanted to inflict more serious harm, . but that Kuldip Brar fought back, preventing that happening’, the judge . said. General Brar was targeted almost three decades after he led the military operation to flush out Sikh separatists from the holy shrine in Punjab. The raid, codenamed Operation Blue Star, resulted in the deaths of more than 500 civilians. In . the aftermath of the Temple raid, Lt Gen Brar told how he has been . subjected to ‘unlimited threats’ and has been branded ‘the number one . enemy of the Sikhs’, leaving him needing maximum security. Commander . Duncan Ball, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command said today: ‘The . conviction of Lakhbir Singh now means that all those directly involved . in the attempt to assassinate General Brar have been brought to justice. ‘We are pleased that today’s sentencing reflects the seriousness of this pre-planned and organised attack.’","The final man directly involved in assassination attempt now jailed .

"By . Emma Innes . Facebook is already awash with selfies of makeup-free women - and makeup-wearing men – attempting to raise money for breast cancer charities. Now, a cervical cancer charity has launched a new app in a bid to raise awareness of the importance of attending cervical screenings. Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust has released the app as part of their Put Yourself In The Picture campaign. When Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer the number of women attending cervical screening soared. It has now dropped to 'pre-Jade Goody' levels with 80 per cent of women taking up their invites . The campaign is aiming to raise awareness of the screening which is thought to save 5,000 lives a year. It has been launched to coincide with the five year anniversary of the death of Jade Goody. When the reality television star died of cervical cancer in 2009, more than 400,000 extra women in England were screened for the disease. However, the number of people attending screenings has now fallen back to 'pre-Jade Goody' levels. Cervical cancer is largely preventable thanks to the screening programme and the HPV vaccine. The screening aims to pick up pre-cancerous cells which can be treated before they even become cancerous. However, . one in five women who are eligible for screening – that is those . between the ages of 25 and 64 - do not take up the offer. A new app allows people to upload selfies and to share them with family and friends on social media while pledging to attend cervical screening. Jade Goody is pictured arriving at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital . For women aged 25 to 29, the figure rises to one in three. On average, younger women wait for 15 months after receiving their . invitation before they attend, while among older women the average delay . is 33 months. The Put Yourself In The Picture app . aims to get people talking about cervical cancer again and to encourage . them to attend a screening. It . allows people to upload a selfie into a digital picture frame and to . share it with friends and family on Facebook and Twitter. The app, which has been launched by a cervical cancer charity, aims to encourage women to attend cervical screening. Image shows how the selfies look when they are uploaded using the app . Through the app women can also pledge to attend cervical screening and to encourage their friends and family to do the same. The app’s release comes after research revealed that the main reason young women do not attend screening is that they keep putting it off. However, 26 per cent of non-attenders say they do not attend because they are worried it would be painful or embarrassing, and 10 per cent say they put it off because they are worried about what the results might say. The charity hopes the app will be successful as the research also showed 30 per cent of young women said they felt a friend reassuring them about the procedure would encourage them to attend. Cervical screening aims to pick up pre-cancerous cells which can be treated before they become cancerous. Image shows the homepage of the app . Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ‘It’s very worrying that five years after Jade Goody’s death 20 per cent of women still don’t attend a cervical screening which can prevent cervical cancer. ‘By launching an app which enables people to literally “put themselves in the picture” on cervical screening, we hope to put cervical screening at the forefront of women’s minds so that they don’t ignore their incredibly important screening invitation. ‘The app has been designed so that people can share their pictures and pledges on social media, so together we can address the decline in uptake of cervical screening in the UK.’ Every day in the UK, eight women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and almost three die of the disease.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps came under . fire from his own party last night over a ‘patronising’ advert . highlighting Budget cuts to bingo and beer duty. Mr Shapps suffered a ferocious backlash on Twitter after posting the advert in an apparent bid to woo working-class voters. Downing Street insisted David Cameron had ‘full confidence’ in his party chairman, adding: ‘He thinks he’s doing a good job.’ But . some Tory MPs said the advert – which sparked dozens of internet spoofs . yesterday – raised questions about Mr Shapps’s ‘suitability’ for the . job. As the row threatened . to overshadow coverage of the Budget, some even suggested it could lead . to Mr Shapp being replaced in a reshuffle expected later this year. Critics said the message reinforced public perceptions that the Conservative Party was out of touch with ordinary voters. Government sources stressed that responsibility for the advert lay with Mr Shapps rather than the Treasury or No 10. One . senior Tory said: ‘When I saw this advert my initial thought was that . it must be a spoof.

Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking . people do more of the things they enjoy.’ Mr Shapps urged Conservative . supporters to ‘spread the word’. One . Tory source yesterday said the advert had been ‘pulled’ and would never . be used again. But a Tory spokesman insisted it had only ever been . intended for use on  the internet and was never planned as a poster . campaign. The spokesman said: ‘We are quite proud of those tax cuts. We stand by what was said in that advert. ‘There is a misconception about it – it was never going to be a poster campaign, it was just an internet infographic. ‘Some of the Left-wing intelligentsia may not like it but the reaction in bingo halls to the tax cut has been very positive.’ Liberal . Democrat Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander described the wording . of the advert as ‘pretty patronising’ and said it ‘demeans some . quite sensible things’. Nick . Clegg added: ‘I think the tweet was a bit silly, partly because the . issues involved in this Budget were really quite serious.’ London . Mayor Boris Johnson also declined to support the advert. ‘I didn’t . write the blooming thing,’ he said. ‘We’re trying to get across the . message that it’s a Budget for everyone.’ Shadow . Chancellor Ed Balls said George Osborne must be ‘frustrated that his . head of campaigns puts out an advert patronising working people by . saying they’ll be happy with a bingo tax and a beer tax. What nonsense . that is’. Simone Blackwell, a writer on political satire The Thick Of It, said the ad was beyond satire . But Mr Osborne . dismissed the row, saying it had been ‘whipped up by the Labour Party’ to disguise the fact they had nothing to say about the Budget. Mr . Osborne said he had played bingo. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said . he did not know when Mr Cameron had last played bingo – or if he had . ever played it at all. However, he is known to enjoy a pint of real ale. The internet was last night awash with spoof versions of Mr Shapps’s advert, which mock it for stereotyping the working class. One . posted on Twitter reads: ‘Bingo! No tax on pies, flat caps or whippets – . keeping our commitment to patronise the working class. Now get off my . land.’ Another says: ‘Bingo! I say, you there! How is your whippet?

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Hospital bosses launched an urgent inquiry last night after the medical records of dozens of patients were found ‘blowing around’ in a street. Personal information on about 49 patients – including names, ages and medical histories – were listed on four so-called ‘ward handover sheets’ found in the middle of Cardiff, more than 40 miles from Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where they originated. In some cases, nurses had written that patients exhibited signs of cancer, but were ‘not aware’ they might have the disease. The records of 49 patients from Frenchay Hospital, in Bristol, were found blowing around in a street in central Cardiff, more than 40 miles from where they were supposed to have been kept . The person who found the papers told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They were just blowing around. Anyone could have picked them up.’ North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, last night offered its ‘sincere apologies’ to those involved and promised a ‘full and thorough investigation’.","Records of 49 patients found blowing around in central Cardiff .

"By . Dan Bloom . Baby-faced: Morgan Halstead, 14, is banned from meeting friends in public without his parents . A 14-year-old tearaway has been banned from meeting his friends in public - unless his parents go with him. Morgan Halstead was handed the unusual Asbo after harassing and intimidating residents for more than a year in Grantham, Lincolnshire. The baby-faced schoolboy also caused criminal damage by throwing stones at people and property, and ignored notices banning him from shopping and leisure areas in the market town. Grantham Magistrates' Court made the order earlier this month after an application by South Kesteven District Council. It bans the teenager from meeting in a public place with more than two people unless he is accompanied by his mother or father. He is barred from several areas of the town including a branch of Costcutters, a community centre, the Meres Leisure Centre and a footpath. The order also bans him from publicly meeting five other teenagers, who cannot be named, or throwing objects towards people or property. South Kesteven District Council operations director Ian Yates said: 'We are not going to tolerate poor behaviour of this nature in our neighbourhoods. 'We and Lincolnshire Police work in partnership with retailers and members of the public in South Kesteven to gain the evidence against these perpetrators of unacceptable behaviour. 'This young man has been responsible for 15 months of anti social behaviour on the Earlesfield estate where innocent people have been harassed and intimidated.' One Grantham resident, Tony Billingham, 64, said: 'The kids around here have nothing to do so they just gather together after school and cause trouble. 'I have seen this kid and his gang of mates terrorising vulnerable old or disabled people and throwing things at them. Ban: The teenager has been barred from several areas of Grantham, including this branch of Costcutter . Legal order: The unusual Asbo was issued earlier this month at Grantham Magistrates' Court . 'And they cause hell for the local shops by trying to nick things and just making a mess of everything. 'He definitely deserves an Asbo but I’m not sure it will work because to someone like him it will just be seen as a badge of honour. 'Something needs to be done to give the young people something to do.' Asbos are civil orders, but breaching them is a criminal offence. A photo of Halstead was released so residents can report him if he causes more trouble. Lincolnshire Police urged residents to keep an eye on Halstead. PC Kay McManus said: 'If anyone sees a breach of these conditions set out by the court, police should be contacted on the non-emergency number 101.'","Morgan Halstead, 14, terrorised residents in Grantham for more than a year .

"By . Neil Sears . and Jack Doyle . Derek Rossi, the career armed robber who shot two policemen in a series of horrifying raids, who has now been given a third life sentence . An armed robber has received an astonishing third life sentence after twice being freed to strike again. The lenience of the criminal justice system was highlighted yet again as a judge yesterday apologised to career criminal Derek Rossi’s two latest victims for the fact that he had been at liberty to attack them. Rossi, 58, was then given his third ‘life’ sentence – but only with an order that he serves 12 years.Critics said that the case showed the phrase ‘life sentence’ was now just a ‘meaningless lie to reassure the public’. The thug, who once almost severed a policeman’s arm with a point-blank pistol blast, was caught on this latest occasion after bursting into a bookmakers. He was traced after he twice fired his shotgun, then dropped it and removed his balaclava to pick it up – which meant he was seen by dozens of witnesses. But that was little comfort to the two female employees when he demanded money from the safe. For he was only free to threaten their lives because the parole board first released him after he was jailed for life in 1984 for shooting at policemen, then again after he was jailed for life for holding up a post office in 2000. Giving Rossi his third life sentence, Judge Peter Clarke said yesterday at Blackfriars Crown Court in London that the staff at the bookmaker, Ann Fairbrass and Hannah Bjorkvall-Green, deserved an apology. Judge Clarke said: ‘Mrs Fairbrass and Mrs Bjorkvall-Green will be sitting in the public gallery wondering how it is that Rossi could have entered the betting shop where they worked when he was the subject of not one, but two sentences of life imprisonment for attempting to murder police officers and  members of the public while committing robberies. ‘The victims deserve an explanation about why a man who had previous life sentences for robbery was given his liberty. I wish to apologise to them on behalf of the criminal justice system for placing them in that position.’ Shotgun cartridges, recovered by police from one of Rossi's many armed robberies . Judge Peter Clarke apologised to the two victims of the Ladbrokes robbery, Ann Fairbass and Hanna Bjorkvall-Green, who were working at the time of one of Rossi's robberies . Judge Clarke added: ‘I’m not convinced by the defendant’s protestations of future good conduct.’ Mrs Bjorkvall-Green told the court that she had been deeply traumatised by the attack, saying: ‘Every time I closed my eyes I could see this man and the gun.’ A villain since his youth, Rossi was given his first life sentence at the Old Bailey in 1984, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 18 years, for ‘terrifyingly violent’ attempted robbery. Freed from that first ‘life’ sentence, he was swiftly given his second after holding up a post office in Dibden in Hampshire in 2000 – apparently within weeks of leaving prison – with a sawn-off shotgun. He escaped with £16,000. This second time, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of six and a half years, but ended up serving 12. However he had not long been released before he launched his latest attack on Ladbrokes in Holborn, central London, at 8am one morning last November. Last night Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘This is a rare and brave example of a judge pointing out that soft sentences put the public at huge risk. ‘The case shows how the phrase “life sentence” has become a lie that falsely reassures the public. In reality it often means the same inadequate prison term and release after a few years.’","Derek Rossi, 58, lifelong criminal, had his first conviction at age 13 .

"By . John Hall . A group of Premier League footballers have put club rivalries aside to invest their vast wealth  in a new property development business, it has been claimed. Liverpool players Luis Suarez, Lucas Leiva and Jose Enrique have reportedly partnered with Arsenal midfielders Mikel Arteta and Santi Cazorla to put money into Capital and Centric Investments LLP. All the footballers are believed to have been appointed directors in the company, which was set up by the Manchester-based Capital and Centric with the aim of purchasing old buildings in the area and developing them into privately rented homes. Working together: Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla (left) and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez (right) have put their football rivalries aside to invest money in Manchester-based Capital and Centric Investments LLP . Development: Capital and Centric aim to purchase old buildings in Manchester (pictured) and other UK cities with the intention of developing the properties into privately rented homes . The company, which is believed to have a number of other investors alongside the footballers, has already raised £50million, according to The Times. The money will be now be used predominately to purchase and develop property in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol, with the hope of generating returns of between 8 and 10 per cent a year while creating a £250million property portfolio. The footballers have each invested different amounts in the scheme and been locked in to the investment for a period thought to be longer than five years, the newspaper reported. Large sums: Liverpool's Lucas Leiva (left) and Arsenal's Mike Arteta (right) are also believed to be involved in the property development project. The company is believed to have already raised £50million in investment . Projects: Capital and Centric is currently developing the former Littlewoods building in Liverpool. In a £4million project, the derelict warehouse will be converted into 18 small office suites . Company: Liverpool left back Jose Enrique is also thought to be involved in the property project . Other than Lucas Leiva, all the . footballers involved in the scheme speak Spanish as a first language, and . are thought to have personal relationships with Capital and Centric . founders Tim Heatley and Adam Higgins. Capital . and Centric say they have completed £30 million in speculative . developments over the last two years, with a further £20million invested . in properties currently under construction. One Capital and Centric property currently being developed is the former Littlewoods building in Liverpool. In a £4million project, the derelict warehouse - which is known locally as 'The Bunker' - will be converted into 18 small office suites for small and medium sized business. Capital and Centric acquired the building in April 2013 from the Homes & Communities Agency, with work beginning last October. The footballers' investment in the property business comes after former Manchester United defender Gary Neville started building a property portfolio in in 2011. Neville, who became assistant manager of England after his retirement from football, is also believed to have been named as a director for Zerum Consult - a new development, planning and sustainable design consultancy - earlier this year. Another former footballer, Robbie Fowler, has had such success with property development after retiring from the sport that he started a training centre for new entrepreneurs. The Robbie Fowler Property Academy claims to help new investors 'build a property portfolio without the need of a footballer's salary'.","Rival footballers put sporting differences aside to invest in a new business .

"By . Katy Winter . A creative cook has made the leap from kitchen experiment to culinary business with his idea of a chocolate filled samosa and is now selling them to the supermarket chain Morrisons. Ajay Kainth wanted to add a new twist to the traditional Asian pastries so started experimenting with flavours. His Chocomosas come in three rather tempting tastes - chocolate and nuts, coconut and chocolate and peanut butter and chocolate. Ajay Kainth with his Chocomosa range which is now on sale at Morrisons after they picked up on his ingenious invention . Ajay said: 'I like experimenting with new things and one day I made up the recipe and it worked. 'I know of a few Indian-style restaurants that make them but I am the first person to retail them to the public. 'Samosas sell all-year round but I wanted to create something unique and with a twist that will make my brand stand out and bring the outdated look of Asian food and packaging into the modern world.' Ajay, 30, developed the idea in the kitchen of his family home in Woodford Green, North East London, when he was growing up. His Chocomosas come in three rather tempting flavours; chocolate and nuts, coconut and chocolate, and peanut butter and chocolate . Bored of making traditional-style samosas, Mr Kainth filled the pastry with chocolate and other accompanying ingredients and watched his family devour them with delight. After trying several professions, including a spell at university studying engineering, he developed the Samosa under his brand name, Fresh off the Boat (FOB) Foods, in June last year. Ajay developed the idea for his Chocomosas in the kitchen of his family home . He then marketed the frozen product at the Halal Food Festival at London’s Excel in September 2013 and drew the attention of a buyer from the country’s fourth largest supermarket chain, Morrisons. Noor Ali, world food buyer at Morrisons, said: 'We have worked hard to ensure our world food offering strongly reflects the needs of those communities local to our stores across the UK. 'We are delighted to be able to offer Chocomosas to our customers.' As of last month, the product is now stocked in 50 branches. Mr Kainth’s younger sister, Natasha, 26, described the product as the next big thing since the cupcake ‘craze’. She said: 'The cupcake business is dying out, so this is something new, original and exciting.' Mr Kainth is set to expand his range of fillings to include different flavours such as fruit fillings in the coming 12 months.","Creator developed the idea in the kitchen of his family home .

"By . Richard Spillett . A betting shop boss faked an armed robbery at his workplace after he got himself into thousands of pounds of debt - due to a secret addiction to gambling. Karl Swift, 25, pretended he had been robbed at knife-point at the William Hill bookmakers where he worked in Goose Green, Wigan after he gambled £2,084 away at a casino. But CCTV footage was examined and showed Swift alone in the betting shop and bending down behind the counter to switch off the security cameras. Karl Swift, 25, faked a robbery at the William Hill where he worked in Wigan after getting into 'desperate financial straits' He said he was 'desperate financial straits' and had only become addicted to gambling after starting work in the betting industry four years earlier. At Liverpool Crown Court this week, Swift, from Orrell, near Wigan pleaded guilty to theft, fraud and attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for 12 months. He has been attending counselling sessions with Gamblers Anonymous, the court heard. Police were called in last September after duty manager Swift falsely claimed that he had been held up at knife-point just after he arrived at the William Hill bookie’s. Swift, from Orrell, near Wigan, said he had only become addicted to gambling after starting work in the betting industry four years earlier . Swift claimed there had been an armed robbery at the William Hill in Goose Green, Wigan. But CCTV showed he was there alone . He said £5,744 was taken and claimed the 'raider' had turned off the shop’s CCTV system and had broken into the safe. But, as well as the incriminating CCTV footage, Swift’s boss saw an unusual sequence of 31 bets the previous day totaling £3,660. Further inquiries revealed Swift himself had placed those bets - of which only seven were successful - and the stakes and not been paid for. In mitigation, defence lawyer Martyn Walsh said Swift was described as 'good worker' but had lost £2,084 in a casino. Mr Walsh added: 'He was a very desperate man who had reached the end of the road.' Judge, Mr Recorder Roderick Carus QC, told him: 'These were were serious offences and you were in a position of trust. You have lost your reputation, your job and now your liberty.'","Karl Swift pretended he had been robbed at a William Hill in Wigan .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two of the Americans who were imprisoned in Iran after accidentally hiking over the border have told how they were able to have sex in prison after one of the guards left the keys in a cell door. Shane Bauer managed to sneak out for a clandestine midnight romp with his then girlfriend Sarah Shourd when they were locked up in neighbouring cells. Mercifully the pair, who are now married, were not caught but in the confusion of sneaking back to his own . cell, Bauer mistakenly took Shourd's pants instead of his own. Secret tryst: Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd have told how they managed to have sex while being held as political prisoners in Iran . The next day, Shourd saw her boyfriend in the prison yard and laughed out loud when she noticed his mistake. She told the Huffington Post: 'I didn't think it was possible, so when Shane asked me ""If I could sneak into your cell would you allow me?"" And I was like ""of course"". Life behind bars: Bauer, Fattal and Shourd tell the story of their imprisonment in new book 'A Sliver of Light' 'And when I realised it was real I got scared, I was like ""they could separate us for ever"". 'It . was a dangerous thing to do but ultimately we couldn't resist. It was a . horrible thing to be separated that way and we didn't know when we . would see each other again.' The couple and their companion Josh . Fattal have written a book about the holiday they took to Kurdistan in 2009 that . quickly turned into a nightmare when a guide led them astray. The . guide mistakenly led them into Iran, and the three college-friends were . arrested. The two men spent more than two years in prison while Shourd . spent most of her year behind bars in solitary confinement. Ms Shourd became severely depressed during her imprisonment, but, in addition to the secret trysts, there were a few periods of unexpected joy such as the time Mr Bauer proposed to her using strings he pulled from a towel fastened with a staple. In the prison yard one day, Bauer pulled her away from the surveillance cameras to pop the question. 'Baby, I didn't want to do this here,' he said. I wanted it to be somewhere beautiful, but...will you marry me?' Following their release, Shourd and Bauer were married in May 2012. They also share another fond memory from their period of imprisonment. Life got even worse when the trio were transferred to Evin, the Tehran prison notorious for holding political prisoners. At one point, the two men were terrorized by a guard they nicknamed 'AK'. AK initially threw Fattal, blindfolded, down a set of stairs before putting Bauer in a headlock and throwing him against the wall. Shourd was released after a year while her friends were kept behind bars for an additional year. Above, a rally for the hikers outside the United Nations in July 2011 .

"By . Luke Garratt . Some days you can spend hours driving around the tight corners of Paris looking for a parking space. But this took a whole new meaning, when he was forced into an incredibly tight spot when his search for a space went terribly wrong, leading him to drive into a Metro station. The driver was found pitched down the stairs to the entrance of the Champs Elysées Metro station, one of the busiest in the city. Wrong turn: A Paris driver accidentally drove into the entrance of one of the busiest Metro stations in the city . Eventually a truck was called in to tow the car out, which drew a massive crowd, presumably much to the driver's embarrassment . The driver was focused on parking his car he failed to notice he was pulling into the station entrance and not a space. French media reports didn't say if anyone was injured, or if alcohol was the cause of the incident, but it seemed the driver only realised his mistake after driving down quite a few stairs. Twitter user Sofiane posted a picture, with the description: 'A bloke who confused an entry to the underground car park with the entrance of the Metro.' Members of the RATP, the state-owned public transport operator, security services stand in front of a car stuck at the entrance of a subway station in Paris . The driver is thought to have been searching for a space on the incredibly busy street, and driven into the station thinking it was one of Paris' many underground car parks . The Metro has over 300 stations in Paris, and hundreds of thousands of drivers, and this could be why this particular parking gaffe wasn't the first to have happened in the City of Light. In 2012, a driver identified only as Johan, 26 at the time, drove his 4x4 SUV partly into the entrance of the Chausee D’Antin Metro, shortly before realising it was not a station entrance. At the time the driver said he was completely sober, and also claimed he had simply taken a wrong turn. He said: 'There was a sign indicating parking for the Haussmann shops just . in front of me, and there was no kerb next to the entrance of the . steps, so that's how I made the mistake. 'By chance there wasn't anyone on the steps.' 'It was one of the strangest things I've seen in along time,' said an eye-witness who was sitting in a nearby cafe at the time. Bizarre: In 2012 a confused tourist tried to drive his car down into a Paris Metro station after mistaking it for a car park . Weird: Eyewitnesses said it was one of the strangest things they had ever seen . Blunder: Fortunately the Frenchman managed to brake hard as soon as he realised what was happening .

An Agence France-Press journalist, his wife and two young children are among the nine dead after four teenage Taliban with mini pistols hidden in their socks opened fire in a Kabul hotel yesterday. Reporter Sardar Ahmad, 40, had been based in Kabul and was at the Serena hotel with his three children and wife Humaira when Taliban gunmen stormed into the building and killed nine people. Mr Ahmad's youngest son is believed to have survived the attack and is said to have undergone emergency treatment. Agence France-Press (AFP) reporter Sardar Ahmad was killed in the attack on Kabul's Serena hotel. This picture was taken just hours before Mr Ahmad, his wife and two of his three children were gunned down . The shooting happened at the luxury hotel which is used by U.N. staff and prominent Afghan politicians in Kabul. Today, AFP colleagues paid tribute to the journalist describing him as 'charming' and 'talented'. An obituary to the journalist read: 'Shocked colleagues of Sardar Ahmad, the senior reporter in AFP's Kabul bureau, Friday mourned the loss of a charming and talented journalist equally at ease covering Afghanistan's wrenching conflict as with colourful tales including a lion who lived on a roof.' The Gathering of Afghan Journalists Group released a statement on the 'tragic' events in which they described the attack as 'cowardly'. A tribute was paid to the 'experienced' and 'renowned' journalist. 'This incident comes despite the fact that Afghan journalists have assiduously tried to remain neutral in their coverage amid difficult circumstances. 'In this attack, the Taliban deliberately and ruthlessly targeted civilians, shooting women and innocent children around the dinner table,' a statement read. The assault on the heavily fortified Serena Hotel, which lasted some three hours, was the latest in a string of attacks by the insurgents seeking to spoil a presidential election on April 5. The gunmen were shot dead by security forces, witnesses and police said on Friday. The election would mark the first time in Afghanistan's history that one elected government hands power to another.

Henrik Eide Dahl, 14, says he was participating in a Call of Duty party in his school's cafeteria when 'everything went dark' and he passed out from kidney failure. While doctors wouldn't specify what kind of energy drink Dahl consumed, his 4 liters is the equivalent of 16 8.4-ounce Red Bulls. That's a lot of caffeine: Henrik Eide Dahl, 14, fell into a coma last month after consuming 4 liters of energy drinks during a video game party . Dahl was flown to a hospital in Lillehammer where his condition only worsened and he fell into a coma. The only thing keeping the teen alive after the caffeine overdose was a respirator and a drip. But eventually Dahl got better, and he woke up 'terrified' when he saw his brothers sitting at the edge of his bed crying. Kidney failure: After collapsing on the floor of his schools' cafeteria, Dahl was transported to a hospital in Lillehammer where his conditioned worsened and he fell into a coma . 'It has been very scary, and i have learned that it is not good to drink that much energy drink,' Dahl told Norway's NRK network. 'But it's getting better and better every day. I'm starting to feel normal now.' In total, Dahl spent 13 days in the hospital and is still on medication to control his high blood pressure. Anne Katherine Duns, a doctor who treated Dahl, says he easily could have died. 'It was severely life-threatening,' Dr Duns said. 'The central nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs and kidneys were affected.' Dahl is now expected to make a full recovery.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Authorities in Syria admit they have only removed less than half of their stockpile of chemical weapons, meaning they risk missing the crucial June 30 deadline for them all to be destroyed. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, agreed to give up the . weapons last year in a deal with Russia and the United States, . but the operation is several months behind schedule. Two . cargoes of the weapons were loaded onto vessels in the Mediterranean . over the past week, meaning half have now been shipped out of the . country, the international team overseeing the disarmament process said. An activist wears a gas mask in Damascus last year. Authorities in Syria have admitted they have only removed less than half of their stockpile of chemical weapons . With the country locked in a bitter civil war that has been raging now for three years, authorities . blame security problems for the delays in bringing the chemicals to the . Mediterranean port Latakia. They have asked to be given until April 27 . to complete the removal of the consignment, which would put the mission . two-and-a-half months behind schedule. Five rockets were fired towards the . Latakia port area earlier this month, with one landing near to where the . international chemical team were staying, sources said on Tuesday.

The . joint mission of the United Nations and the Organisation for the .

The . joint UN-OPCW mission said the delivery of the latest two consignments . to vessels off Latakia means that 29.5 percent of the 'Priority 1' chemicals, considered the most dangerous, have been removed and 82.6 . percent of 'Priority 2' chemicals. Today Syrian troops closed a border . crossing with Lebanon amid heavy clashes with rebels in the area that . activists said killed 12 people. The . fighting forced dozens of wounded to pour across the volatile boundary . to seek help on the Lebanese side, officials and activists said. The fighting on the Syrian . side was so intense that stray bullets and rockets landed on the . Lebanese side, in the region of Wadi Khaled, according to Lebanon's . state-run National News Agency. A Lebanese man in Wadi Khaled was wounded and rushed to a nearby hospital, the report said. The . NNA said Syrian government forces closed the Bqaiaa crossing because of . the fighting earlier on Thursday. Some stray bullets hit a Lebanese . army checkpoint and two homes caught fire and burned in Lebanon, the . report also said. The . Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighting . concentrated in and around the Syrian village of al-Hosn, where 12 . people were killed on Thursday. The Observatory's chief, Rami Abdurrahman, said it was not clear if those killed were civilians or rebel fighters.

Residents in some parts of northern Lebanon closed roads in protest of the shelling from Syria, NNA said. Lebanon has been on edge since the central Syrian town of Yabroud was taken by President Bashar Assad's troops last Sunday. Sectarian violence between Lebanon's Sunnis and Shiites linked to Syria's civil war has left scores of people dead in recent months. In a spill-over from the conflict next door, pro- and anti-Syrian gunmen clashed overnight in the northern Libyan city of Tripoli. Fighting there has been ongoing since last week, with occasional lulls. Strikes: Activists said Syrian warplanes and helicopter gunships carried out several air raids in the northern province of Aleppo on Tuesday killing and wounding a number of people . Also Thursday, Syrian state TV . reported that troops discovered a makeshift rebel bomb-making factory . used to rig cars with explosives in the border village of Ras Al-Ayn.

"By . Sara Malm . An Indian man suffering from a facial deformity lives in constant pain after giving up on ever having surgery to remove his 9lbs ‘trunk’. Chana Lal, 35, cannot eat or talk properly because of the tumour which has grown from his face down to his chest. Mr Lal, who lives in a remote village just outside Lucknow, in Uttar Pradesh, northern India, avoids mirrors and lives alone, supported by his two nieces. Scroll down for video . Deformed: Chana Lal, 35, who lives  in a remote village just outside Lucknow, in Uttar Pradesh, India, can't eat or talk properly because of his large facial tumour . He suffers from severe neurofibromatosis, which has seen what was once a small facial deformity grow into a 9lbs 'trunk'. Mr . Lal has attempted surgery in the past, most recently ten years ago, but . nearly bled to death and doctors told him to never try it again if he . wanted to live. Mr Lal, the . youngest of eight siblings, lives as a recluse, and gets through his . day-to-day chores with the help of two of his nieces. He . said: ‘I have an ugly face; I don’t even like looking at myself in the . mirror so I don't expect anyone else to look at me either. ‘I . would love to have surgery but I have lost all hope. I almost died last . time I had surgery so I doubt anything can be done to this face.’ The elephant man: Mr Lal's parents were offered money to display him during shows when he was a child, but they refused . Only family: Mr Lal lives as a recluse in the village, but is helped with his day to day activities by two of his nieces . Mr . Lal was born with a very small blemish on his face at his home in the . village where he still resides, but with his parents very poor, and no . doctors or hospitals nearby, he did not see a medial professional until . he was eight. ‘I knew there was something strange about my face when children would run away from me,’ he said. ‘I . remember crying to my mother and she told me directly that I had a . scary face. After that I never asked anyone to play with me again.' That . year, his late parents took him to a doctor, but the 15,000 Rupee . (£148) fee for treatment was too expensive for the family and they went . home. Mr Lal’s parents were even offered money by a travelling circus to showcase him, but they refused. He returned to the doctor at the age of 25 after his family finally raised enough money for surgery. During surgery, doctors cut into a main blood vessel and Mr Lal started bleeding uncontrollably. He says the doctors advised his parents if they wanted him to live he should never have another operation. Constant pain: Mr Lal can no longer chew or talk properly and has lost the sight in his left eye and can't hear through his left ear . No going back: What was once a small facial deformity has now grown into a 9lbs 'trunk' The tumour has now grown so large that Mr Lal has lost his eyesight in his left eye and hearing in his left ear. ‘I . can’t even chew because my jaw has dropped and my teeth can’t do their . job. I’d love to know what it’s like to bite into a juicy apple, he . says. Although he takes work as a labourer on building sites when he can, manual work is often painful. ‘I’m . in agony. My head hurts when I have to carry heavy things but I don’t . complain; the boss wouldn’t give me work if he heard me moan.’ Mr Lal lives alone but is looked after by his niece Suman Verma. She has tried to find her uncle a wife. Ms . Verman, 25, said: ‘I feel very sad for my uncle when I think of him . alone. 'I want him to have a normal life like all my other uncles. When I . was younger I used to be scared of him but I’ve got used to his face . now. He’s a softly spoken caring man; I’ve never seen him get angry. ‘We’re . trying to find him a wife, but families turn away when they see his . condition. I want a woman to love my uncle for who he is.’ Trying hard: Although he picks up work when he can, Mr Lal says it is painful to work with the tumour . No hope: Mr Lal's family managed to raise money for him to have surgery ten years ago, but after doctors failed to stem bleeding during the operation, they told his parents he could never be helped . The 'original' elephant man, Joseph Merrick, who lived in the late 1800s . Mr . Lal on the other hand has lost hope, saying he would like to get . married and have children but that ‘fathers think their daughters are . going to catch my disease.’ ‘They think it’s contagious and they quickly leave because they’re scared.’ When . he travels outside his village people are amazed by his facial . deformity and think he is an incarnation of the Hindu elephant God . Ganesh. Mr Lal said: . ‘People touch my feet and ask me to pray for them because they say I . have the face of a god. But they anger me; of course I’m not a god. I . wouldn’t be in this much pain and misery if I was a god.’ ‘I . would love to get rid of this ugly face. If a doctor out there thinks . they can do something I’d have no issues. I’d try anything.’ Dr . Vinayak Mishra, 34, a general surgeon at Hemkunt Private Nursing Home, . in Lucknow, said: ‘This is a severe case of neurofibromatosis Type I. The tumour has completely deformed his facial structure. 'If . this disease continues to progress he might develop ulcerations and . infectious complications. He will not die from this condition but the . consequences of having such a big tumour might eventually kill him.’","Chana Lal, 35, from Uttar Pradesh suffers from severe neurofibromatosis .

"By . Chris Brooke . A tunnel long enough to span the English Channel could be built beneath some of Britain’s most beautiful countryside following environmental concerns about a £1billion potash mine scheme. The ambitious engineering project would see a 22-mile tunnel constructed up to 1,100ft under the North York Moors national park. The company behind the mine, Sirius Minerals, wants to dig two mine shafts to a depth of 1,500 metres and extract the mineral polyhalite – a type of potash used as a fertiliser. Countryside: The tunnel, 1,500 metres under ground, was designed in response to environmental concerns . Originally the company wanted to move the mineral in slurry form via a pipeline near the surface. But objectors were concerned that the pipeline would scar and damage the countryside. The proposed solution, which will be submitted to planning authorities later this year, would see the rock transported from the mine to a six metre-wide underground tunnel. It could then be transported on a conveyor belt from the mine near Sneaton to the processing plant – adding £170million to the cost of the scheme, but reducing its total footprint by 70 per cent. The tunnel would be as long as the section of Channel Tunnel below the sea and its construction would bring more than a million cubic metres of rock to the surface – enough to fill Wembley Stadium. The firm in charge of the mine has claimed it would create up to 6,000 jobs, boost the economy by up to £1billion a year and provide the Government with £300million annually in tax payments. Picturesque: The view of the North York Moors . More than 400 landowners are also keeping their fingers crossed that the tunnel wins over objectors in the green lobby. Many of them are struggling farmers, but would become millionaires if the mineral is mined below their fields, as they stand to receive a share of the mine’s total annual revenue. Chris Fraser, the chief executive of Sirius Minerals, said: ‘This  would minimise our impact at the surface, removing the need for any construction in protected habitats.’ However Tom Chadwick, from the North Yorkshire Moors Association, said: ‘The tunnel is absolutely enormous, there’s no doubt about that. But we reserve judgment as to whether this new scheme will be any better than the last one.’","Plans would see ambitious tunnel built under North York Moors .

"By . Tara Brady . A £30,000-a-year vegetarian private school is being sued by parents who claim their son was subjected to 'racist bullying'. St Christopher School, in Letchworth, Hertfordshire - known as 'St Chris' - differs from similarly-priced traditional boarding schools, such as Eton and Harrow. Staff and pupils are required to eat no meat, there is no school uniform and pupils address teachers by their first names, rather than as 'Sir' or 'Miss.' St Christopher School, in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, is being sued by parents who claim their son was subjected to 'racist bullying' The school was founded in 1915 'to promote understanding amongst students of other cultures and religions' and create an environment 'where all children are celebrated as individuals, regardless of their particular abilities.' Twenty-six per cent of its pupils are non-white. However, the idiosyncratic school is now at the centre of a High Court row, after the parents of a pupil - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - refused to pay £25,000 in fees, claiming that 'members of staff at the school were racist.' London¿s High Court heard allegations made by parents who claim their son was subjected to racist bullying . London’s High Court heard the school aims to promote the personal and creative growth of pupils as individuals through its libertarian approach to education and is the alma mater of film director Michael Winner, critic AA Gill and presenter George Lamb. St Chris’s lawyers vehemently deny the parents’ accusations, but Mr Justice Holroyde must now decide whether the 'atypical independent school' has betrayed the principles laid down by its founding fathers. The judge was told that controversy began brewing when the pupil’s parents stopped paying their fees and the company that runs the school, St Christopher School (Letchworth) Ltd, launched a claim against them, saying they were contractually obliged to pay up. However, the parents countered with allegations that the school had failed their son and launched a High Court counter-claim alleging breach of duty against the school and seeking damages 'substantially in excess of the fees claimed.' Past pupils: George Lamb and Michael Winner went to St Christopher School, in Letchworth, Hertfordshire . Anna Dilnot, for St Chris, told the judge today: 'The allegation is that a class teacher and a PE teacher discriminated against (the boy) on grounds of race...the allegation is that (he) was subjected to racial bullying which was not properly addressed by the school'. The parents claim their son was given 'less favourable treatment on grounds of race', said the barrister, who added: 'The nub of the parent’s counter-claim is that the school was a harmful environment.' 'The allegations being made by the parents are serious: that members of staff at the school were racist...that certain members of staff encouraged an atmosphere where other students could bully...and that the school failed to investigate and then deliberately covered up the truth,' she added. Among other things, the parents claim a PE teacher 'intimidated their son by shouting at him, causing him to wet himself' and 'called him an idiot in front of other pupils.' The school was founded in 1915 'to promote understanding amongst students of other cultures and religions' They allege that the atmosphere at the school 'caused a loss of confidence and self-esteem' in their son and left him 'anxious and fearful of bullying and sustaining injuries'. The parents say their complaints should have been referred to Hertfordshire County Council as a child protection issue, rather than being dealt with internally by St Chris. Flatly denying that the allegations, Miss Dilnot told the judge: 'The nature of the allegations is extraordinary. 'The school strenuously denies all of them. Although it accepts that the parents genuinely believe that they are correct...there is no evidence to support their allegations.' Sketching out the school’s founding principles, she added: 'St Chris is an atypical independent school. It is not like Eton or Harrow. 'It is quite informal, there is no school uniform, pupils and staff have a vegetarian diet and the children call teachers by their first names. 'It was founded to promote understanding between the different cultures and religions and on the principle that each child is different and should not be treated all the same.' She said that the parents had signed a contract agreeing to pay the fees before their son enrolled and disputed their claim that the school’s alleged failings had absolved them of the debt. She added: 'The issues for decision amount to whether the school acted in such a way as to breach its contractual duty, whether any breach was repudiatory and thus had the effect of discharging the (parents) from a future obligation to pay and whether any breach caused them any loss.' The barrister also told the judge that the pupil at the centre of the row is now no longer at the school.Outside court, Miss Dilnot said: 'The counter-claim is for damages for alleged breach of duty and is substantially in excess of the fees being claimed. This is really all about the counter-claim.' The boy’s mother is representing the family in person. The hearing, set to last a week, continues.","St Christopher School, in Hertfordshire, differs from other boarding schools such as Eton and Harrow .

Newquay, on the other hand, has a permanent population of just 19,500, with much of its income generated by the multi-million pound surfing industry. Despite their obvious differences, Newquay is hardly unfamiliar with the hustle and bustle that residents of Lewisham have grown so used to. In summer months, the town's population can swell to around 100,000 people, as tourists, many of them teenagers, arrive on mass to populate the many holiday rental properties along Newquay's picturesque Atlantic coastline. Newquay is, of course, the centre Britain's surf industry -  with a reputation as one of the best places to ride the waves in northern Europe. Sprawling Lewisham has no comparable tourism industry, as it is situated six miles from the centre of London - too far for many international tourists to travel. The London suburb has experienced major regeneration in recent years, however, with further plans to redevelop the run-down town centre.","Developer offers combined sale of Lewisham flats and Cornwall lodges .

"By . Peter Jenson . Five months is a long time in football and an eternity in the struggle for supremacy between Real Madrid and Barcelona. When Gareth Bale made his Clasico debut in October Barcelona won 2-1 with a goal from Neymar who had supposedly cost just £48.6m. Bale was hauled off after hour – having cost twice as much as his opposing number and yet looking like half the player. Scroll down for video... The Real deal: Gareth Bale joined Real Madrid from Tottenham for a world record £86m in the summer . On the up: After a stuttered start, Bale has started to prove his worth with 14 goals and 17 assists this season . Inauspicious: Bale was hauled off after a lacklustre performance in his first clasico at the Nou Camp . Boy from Brazil: By contrast, Neymar scored on his first taste of La Liga's biggest game . When he makes his Santiago Bernabeu . clasico debut on Sunday Real Madrid will be four points ahead of their . rivals instead of six points behind and his world has been turned upside . down. Gone are the concerns about his injury problems and with them the doubts over his price tag. Neymar’s . real value, in contrast, has everyone obsessed. An investigation into . how much he really cost is now up around the £80m mark and as the . price has risen, his worth to the team has declined. The more expensive . he becomes the worse he looks; and the more Bale looks like a bargain in . comparison. Bale has found . a home out on the right of Real Madrid’s now famed BBC front three . alongside [Karim] Benzema and  Cristiano [Ronaldo] and the combination . has scored 52 goals between them with Bale getting on the scoresheet 14 . times and providing 17 assists – more than any other La Liga based . player. Reversal of fortune: Bale and Neymar's careers in Spain have moved in opposite directions since El Clasico . Provider: Bale has notched up more assists - 17 - than any other player in the Spanish league . B: Gareth BALE . B: Karim BENZEMA . C: CRISTIANO Ronaldo . The injuries have . cleared up too. After a two-month period around the mid-winter break . when his minutes-played ratio dropped below 50 per cent and it seemed he . was being held together by blue Kinesiology tape, he now looks far less . worthy of the ‘Glassman’ nickname he had been given by some, and has . played all but 17 minutes of the last nine games . There . was a cruel irony that his room in the players’ private hotel at . Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex where the team often stay overnight . before or after big games was opposite the physio’s room, but he is now . taking big matches in his stride, even coming off the bench in midweek . to replace Jese whose cruciate ligament had been torn ruling him out for . the rest of the season. Tale of the tape: How Bale and Neymar's first seasons in la Liga have compared . The . 21-year-old Jese had come on in that first Clasico scoring Real . Madrid’s consolation goal and begging the question why spend 100m euros . when you have such a home-grown talent coming through for free. Shedding . light on Bale’s physical fragility his former Wales boss John Toshack . told Marca this week: 'He had several serious injuries when he was a . very young player. The first one ruled him out for 10 months and the . second for nine. That is a long time to be out between the age of 18 and . 20. The treatment he had was not always the best and that is why he . needs to be 100 per cent and can’t be one of these players who can play . through injury.' Money matters: Neymar signed for Barcelona for a supposed £48.6m, although that price is being questioned . Paying the price: The more Neymar is reported to be worth, the worse his performances on the pitch have been . Brothers in arms: Meanwhile, Bale has struck up a blossoming relationship with the world's best, Ronaldo . The stress . of not being physically right accompanied the doubts over that world . record price-tag. He said on the day of his presentation that he would . have signed for a penny. That certainly would have lowered expectations. He had not come cheaply and no-one has let him forget that during a . first season in which during several games he has even been whistled by . impatient supporters. Olympiacos . coach Michel is a former Real Madrid player who knows all about the . demands of the Bernabeu. He was jeered too despite being a home-grown . talent and Spain international. 'It’s . impossible for that price tag not to weigh heavy,' he says. 'The first . person who will think ‘I’m probably not worth 100m’ is the player . himself. Fighting fit: Bale has recovered from the injury problems that plagued the start of his career at the Bernabeu . Weighing heavy: Olympiacos coach Michel (C) has warned of the pressure on Bale from his enormous price tag . 'It’s not the . player’s fault, it’s the market’s fault. And the fact that he doesn’t . understand the Spanish media will not save him because you can smell the . doubts. I’m certain that he will be aware of people questioning the . price. The spotlight is on him and it is not just an external spotlight. At a big club like Madrid the spotlight is also internal.' But . the escalation of the Neymar fee with the uncovering of more and more . contracts that if interpreted to have been simulated wages will send the . price rising further because of tax evasion penalties has changed . Bale’s status as La Liga’s most expensive player. And . the idea that the Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has to pick Bale . because he cost so much has been replaced by the notion that Gerardo . Martino at Barcelona is under boardroom pressure to select Neymar. Frontrunners: Real Madrid can open up a seven point lead over Barcelona is they win the clasico . Stick or twist? Criticism of Carlo Ancelotti (L) and Gerardo Martinez's selection policies have changed . 'No-one . can say that Bale doesn’t deserve to be in the team on his own merit . because his numbers speak for themselves,' says Michel. Ancelotti . has admitted his team for Sunday’s game now picks itself with Bale very . much in it. Barcelona coach Martino, meanwhile, knows supporters want . him  to leave Neymar where he was last weekend when Barça won 7-0 – on . the bench. The forward line . of Alexis Sanchez, Pedro and Leo Messi has actually only scored one goal . fewer than Real Madrid’s famed BBC and Barça followers want those three . to start this weekend. Whoever . accompanies Messi, Sunday will still be about him and Ronaldo first and . foremost. The idea that Ronaldo is now ‘streets ahead of any other . player in the world’ as heard by some commentators in midweek forgets . that Messi has scored 17 goals in his last 17 games. The weekend’s duel will throw up the usual race to break more and more ridiculous records. Record breaker? Ronaldo is one goal away from break Ferenc Puskas' all-time scoring record for Madrid . Lionel Flair: Messi is getting back to his best after a season disrupted by injury . Ronaldo . needs another goal to beat Ferenc Puskas’ 240 goals scored for Madrid . and Messi is one goal short of Alfredo Di Stefano’s 18 goals scored in . the Clasico fixture record. The Argentine is also one goal from Hugo . Sanchez in the all-time league scorers list – passing him would leave . only Telmo Zarra to aim for. The two of them will fight it out for top of the bill but there is a fascinating undercard. Bale . lost out to Neymar last October but now he has his rematch and after an . incredible turn around in their first seasons in Spain he is favourite . to come out on top on Sunday and to win his first Spanish League title . at the end of the season.","Real Madrid are four points ahead of Barcelona ahead of El Clasico .

"By . Emma Glanfield . The father of Chelsea captain John Terry has told how his son was a ‘tower of strength’ who had 'been through it as well' after being cleared of a race-hate charge in his latest brush with the law. Ted Terry, 59, had been accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette. Speaking outside court Terry said he felt 'relieved' at the verdict – which came less than two years after his professional footballer son was also cleared of racial abuse. Edward 'Ted' Terry said he was 'relieved' after being cleared of racially-aggravated assault at the Old Bailey in Central London yesterday . England captain John Terry talks to the media during a press conference. He has supported his father throughout the trial this week and was accused of racial abuse in 2011 . John Terry had been accused of hurling racial abuse at Queens Park ranger player Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match in 2011. He was cleared of the charge by Westminster Magistrates' Court but was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association. It means both the father and son have now won court cases where they’ve been accused of racially-aggravated offences. On the steps of the Old Bailey, he told reporters yesterday: ‘I'm just going home and I'm going to phone John up. 'It's been a hard year for all of us. We all felt it was nothing, really. It was stupid.’ Speaking to The Sun, Mr Terry also told how his England footballer son had supported him throughout the trial. He said: ‘It has been a tough time for him as well. But he just kept saying to me, “You will be alright, Dad. You'll be OK”. ‘He's been a tower of strength and he has been through it as well. I worried he felt a bit responsible as Mr Talafair admitted in court he went to the police after being told who I was. ‘I feel very relieved.’ Ted Terry put on a public display of relief after being cleared of racist abuse at the Old Bailey . A jury of seven men and five women took an hour and 20 minutes to find Ted Terry (right) not guilty of one count of racially-aggravated common assault on Amarjit Talafair (left) after a five-day trial . A jury of seven men and five women took an hour and 20 minutes to find self-employed decorator Terry not guilty of one count of racially-aggravated common assault after a five-day trial. Terry, from Grays in Essex, was also cleared of one count of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence. His colleagues, Stephen Niland, 36, and Moldova-born Tudor Musteata, 47, were also found not guilty of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence. John Terry, pictured during a Premier League match, was cleared of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during a match in 2011 . Mr Talafair said that he had suffered no injury from Terry's alleged headbutt because he was able to get out of the way in time and admitted calling the defendant a 'fat bald p****' during the stand-off. Giving evidence, Terry admitted putting his face against Mr Talafair's and calling him a 'f***** tight p****', but denied headbutting him or saying ""f****** P***, let's have it right here and now'. The father of two and grandfather of six told the jury: 'I just said 'f*** off, go back downstairs', things like that. It wasn't no racist stuff.' The confrontation started after a dispute over a cigarette outside The Windsor pub near Fenchurch Street station in London. The jury of seven men and five women also heard that the Chelsea captain's father received a 24-month conditional discharge for common assault in 2005 and a suspended prison sentence for an offence of supplying class A drugs in 2010. Two months after being arrested for racially aggravated assault in March last year, Terry admitted racially abusing another man. He was fined £200 for saying 'f****** Irish p****' during an argument at Barking rail station, the court heard. John Terry's mother Sue was cautioned after being caught shoplifting £800 of shopping from Tesco and Marks & Spencer in 2009 . Ted Terry's appearance today at the Old Bailey, where he was acquitted of a racist attack, is the latest in a string of scandals to strike the Terry family over the years.In 2010 Terry was given a suspended prison sentence and 100 hours' community service after he admitted supplying drugs.He had been caught on camera handing over three wraps of cocaine for £120 by an undercover reporter in a bar in Essex.He told the reporter, who posed as a chauffeur buying the drugs for his wealthy boss: 'The stuff 's all right. I get off on it.'He added: 'This is just between me and you. Don't tell him that I'm John Terry's dad.'John Terry's mother Sue has also run into trouble with the law. In 2009 she was caught shoplifting £800 of shopping from Tesco and Marks & Spencer.She was arrested along with the footballer's mother-in-law Sue Poole after shop attendants noticed them walking out of a store in Weybridge, Surrey, with a shopping trolley filled with shoes, clothes and even pet food.Terry and Poole accepted a caution from officers after being caught, which would have been put on both women's criminal records.A police spokesman said at the time: 'Cautions are usually applied for more minor matters or when it is a first time offence. A caution represents an admission of guilt and forms part of a criminal record.'John Terry has also found himself in court on race charges. He was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers on the football pitch in October 2011.Prosecutors said Terry swore and used the word 'black' of Mr Ferdinand. He was cleared of the charge, but a later hearing by the Football Association still imposed a £220,000 fine and a four-match ban.Their verdict said that Terry had been found guilty of 'using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand and which included a reference to colour and/or race.'In 2010 he was also exposed by the Daily Mail for touting his personal box at Wembley Stadium for £4,000 a match.The terms of the perk, which he received as then England football captain, specifically forbade Terry from hiring the box out, but an undercover reporter was offered use of it by one of Terry's go-betweens.Shortly after the revelations, coupled with an ongoing controversy about attempts to cover up an extra-martial affair, he was sacked as England captain by Fabio Capello.","Ted Terry, 59, said he was 'relieved' at being cleared at Old Bailey .

"By . Chris Wheeler . David Moyes admits that he has felt ‘ashamed’ over Manchester United’s slump at times this season but believes his team are still capable of producing another big performance to topple European champions Bayern Munich. United were paired with the German giants in the draw for the Champions League quarter-finals yesterday after wiping out a two-goal deficit to beat Olympiacos at Old Trafford in midweek. It was one of the few highlights of Moyes’s troubled reign and the United boss confessed that, after suffering six home defeats this season, it was a relief to be able to look supporters in the eye as he made the walk from his dug-out to the tunnel. Joy of victory: Manchester United boss David Moyes celebrates his side's 3-0 win over Olympiacos with the Old Trafford fans . Red alert: United celebrate one of Robin van Persie's three goals against Olympiacos which sent them through to the Champions League quarter-finals . Despair: Moyes, left, looks on as his team toil against Liverpool during United's 3-0 home defeat . ‘I thought it was great that I could applaud the supporters on Wednesday night,’ he said. ‘In some of the other games I’ve felt ashamed because the team haven’t played well enough. ‘The big thing was that I could look the supporters in the face after the game because I thought that we had given them something to shout about and had nothing to be ashamed of in our performance.’ Bayern have knocked United out of Europe twice since Sir Alex Ferguson’s side famously beat them with two late goals to win the Champions League in 1999, and will be firm favourites when they meet again next month. Moyes, an avid observer of  German football who was linked with the managerial posts at Schalke and Wolfsburg during his time at Everton, is well aware of what his opponents can do. His scouting missions to Bavaria to watch potential transfer targets Toni Kroos, Dante and Mario Mandzukic have given the United boss a valuable insight into Pep Guardiola’s side, and he believes there are some weaknesses that can be exploited. Famous night: United beat Bayern 2-1 to win the 1999 Champions League final . Past meeting: Munich knocked United out of the 2001 Champions League at the quarter-final stage . Dutch class: Munich winger Arjen Robben's goal in the second leg of the 2010 Champions League quarter-final saw United exit the competition on away goals . 'I’ve got a few things that I’ve seen . that I would try to work on and capitalise on,’ added Moyes. ‘They are . the holders but I don’t think the holders have ever won the Champions . League so hopefully we can try and do something about that. ‘When . we were 2-0 down to Olympiacos I don’t think there were too many people . putting us through so in a lot of ways it didn’t matter who I drew but . I’ve probably got the favourites. Ones to beat: Munich are the current holders of the Champions League . ‘They proved that they’re the best team in the world by winning the Club World Cup but I’m actually looking forward to it. ‘There . have been some epic games between the two clubs over the years and if I . can get another epic game then that will mean we have come close. That . has to be the idea.’ It . was perhaps typical of Moyes’s time at Old Trafford that no sooner had . he spoken about his excitement at facing Bayern than Robin van Persie — . whose hat-trick against Olympiacos made it all  possible — was . effectively ruled out of both legs with a knee injury. Blow: United will have to do without the services of Van Persie for the Munich clash as the Dutch striker has been ruled out for six weeks with a leg injury . United . are already without Patrice Evra for the first game through . suspension, meaning that Moyes may have to rely on Alex Buttner at left . back, and he could offer no assurances that injured central defenders . Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling will be fit in time. At least the embattled United boss could enjoy a little respite on Friday. While . victory over the Greeks lifted some of the pressure building around . him, the quarter-final draw completely overshadowed Saturday’s difficult . trip to West Ham. The challenge, he acknowledges, is to produce performances like Wednesday night on a consistent basis. Change in fortunes? Moyes has called on his United side to reproduce the performance against Olympiacos for the remainder of the season . ‘I . came to the club to have those nights,’ said Moyes. ‘I joined Manchester United because I knew they would happen more often than not. 'We’ve . had some big highs, mainly in the Champions League, but some big lows . in the Premier League and that is the bit we will look to improve on. ‘It has been a difficult initiation period but I still believe that my time here will have more good times than bad times. We will not always be right at the top but we have to be closer than where we are now.’ United wins: 2Bayern wins: 3Draws: 4 . September 1998B Munich: 2Man Utd: 2 .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Manchester United’s hopes of rescuing their season with Champions League glory were dealt a hammer blow when Robin van Persie was ruled out of both legs of the quarter-final with Bayern Munich. The striker, whose hat-trick against Olympiacos on Wednesday set up the tie with the European champions, will be out for up to six weeks — meaning he may not be fit until United’s final Premier League game on May 11. After a day of tests on the injury he suffered near the end of the Olympiacos game, United’s medical staff confirmed that Van Persie had a strained knee.

"By . John Hall . and Mark Duell . A 61-year-old homeowner revealed today how oversleeping by 10 minutes saved his life after a Royal Mail lorry smashed into his house. Len Wiles, of Gosport, Hampshire, said he usually goes downstairs at 5.45am and switches on the TV - but he did not get out of bed at the normal time yesterday after having a bad night's sleep. The former aircraft company worker and his wife Anne, 66, had to be rescued from the upper floor of their Â£160,000 home after the 7.5-tonne lorry crashed into the property at 5.47am yesterday. Scroll down for video . Crash: Len and Anne Wiles had to be rescued from the upper floor of their home in Gosport, Hampshire after a 7.5 tonne Royal Mail lorry crashed into their property at around 5.45am yesterday . Destroyed: The driver of the lorry was checked over by paramedics at the scene, but is not thought to have been seriously injured in the impact. Mr and Mrs Wiles were left shocked but uninjured . Accident: It is thought the driver of the Royal Mail lorry lost control of his vehicle and smashed into three parked cars before crashing through a small brick wall (both pictured right) and ploughing into the building . Mr Wiles told the Daily Mirror: 'I usually go down at 5.45am and switch on the TV. But I had a bad night's sleep. If I had gone down like normal, I'd be dead.' A fireman asked the couple if they were 'expecting a parcel' when he arrived to rescue them. It is thought the driver of the Royal Mail lorry lost control of his vehicle and smashed into three parked cars before crashing through a brick wall and ploughing into the building. Describing the moment the firefighter . arrived at the property, Mr Wiles said: 'The fireman poked his head . through the window and said, ""Were you expecting a parcel?"".' Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said they were alerted to the crash on the busy Brockhurst Road at 5.47am yesterday. Mr . and Mrs Wiles, who had recently agreed to sell the property after . moving in when it was built last October, were left shocked but . uninjured. They are now hoping the buyer will not pull out. Risk: The building was so badly damaged that neighboruing homes were temporarily evacuated due to a fear the property could fall down . Len Wiles pictured beside the house, which has now undergone critical reconstruction . A Royal Mail lorry caused serious damage to the outside and inside of the house, meaning a vast reconstruction effort to the Hampshire home . 'I'm hoping our buyer can hang on until the house is repaired - it's a beautiful house,' Mr Wiles said. The driver of the lorry was checked . over by paramedics at the scene, but was not thought to have been . seriously injured in the impact. Mrs Wiles said: 'We were fast asleep . in bed when suddenly we heard a great big explosion and a crash. We . thought there had been an accident outside on the road. 'My . husband jumped out of bed and went out onto our landing. There was a . gaping hole where the stairs were and the front of the lorry was embedded in it.' Neighbour Nicola Dugan, 42, said: 'At about 5.45am I heard a massive bang, it was so loud it was like a bomb had gone off. While the damage is extremely extensive, Len Wiles is glad that he stayed in bed, as it managed to save his life from the lorry which crashed through his front room . The lorry caused a gaping hole where the stairs were, and has meant that the load bearing parts of the house were ripped out . 'I put on my pyjamas and rolled out of bed and saw a giant Royal Mail red lorry inside my next door neighbour's house. 'Our front door has been damaged as well as our gas pipe, because Len's car was pushed into our house,' she added. 'But the main thing is Les and Anne are . fine - it's a miracle. 'He is retired and even said to me he woke up 10 . minutes later than he normally did. If he had woken up then, he would . have been in the front room and would have been in trouble.' Mrs . Dugan said she noticed the male Royal Mail delivery driver, who she . thought was in his 50s, appeared 'dazed and shocked' after the crash. Mr Wiles said his life was saved because he had decided to stay in bed for an extra 10 minutes, as on every other weekday he would have been on the ground floor of the building at that time . The Royal Mail driver had a lucky escape as it was passenger side of the lorry that felt the worst of the impact . Worry: Mr and Mrs Wiles, who had recently agreed to sell the property after moving in when it was built last October, were left shocked but uninjured. They are now hoping the buyer will not pull out. '[He] said he had no idea what happened... He was wearing a full uniform including his full high-vis yellow coat, with the Royal Mail logo,' she added. 'I looked out of my window and saw Len upstairs, he was shocked, he looked scared,' Ms Dugan said. 'He shouted that he was okay and even said, ""We've only just sold the house - what are we going to do?"".' A . fire service spokesman said: 'The lorry crashed into the property . cutting off the staircase leaving two people trapped upstairs in the . house. 'Firefighters used an aerial ladder platform to rescue the people from the first floor of the house.' Unstable: The house and neighbouring properties were initially evacuated as it was feared the semi-detached property could fall down when the lorry was removed . Neighbour Nicola Dugan said the 'massive bang' was so loud that she initially thought a bomb had gone off .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Olympic medallist Craig MacLean has revealed that his cycling career was blighted for 12 years by undiagnosed digestive disease. The 42-year-old admitted on Twitter that he suffered exhaustion, anaemia and cramps – without realising he had coeliac disease. He . says: ‘Although I was training hard, my body was unable to repair . itself quickly enough. I am now convinced my illness was affecting my . track times.’ Long struggle: Craig MacLean, with Chris Hoy and Jason Queally after winning the Track Cycling World Cup in 2005, suffered in silence for more than a decade before discovering he had coeliac disease . In sufferers, the immune system attacks the healthy . gut in reaction to a protein in bread and other foods. Diarrhoea, . bloating, stomach pain and tiredness are other symptoms. Craig says: ‘Sometimes the cramps were so bad it made it impossible to continue training.’ Craig, who won silver at the Sydney 2000 Olympics, was finally diagnosed through a blood test four years ago.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Take a trip back in time for a tour of bustling Chicago at the peak of the 1940s. This rare colour footage showing the Windy City some 70 years ago, was discovered by chance at an estate sale in the Auburn Gresham district by professional film and video colorist Jeff Altman. Mr Altman, a former Chicago resident who recently moved to New York, decided to take a gamble after the dusty old canister caught his eye among other items at the sale this fall. Chance find: This rare colour footage of Chicago in the 1940s was discovered at a yard sale . To watch the full video, click here . He had no idea what was on the film and the only clues were two labels reading 'Chicago' and 'Print 1', but he decided to take a chance and shell out $40 to take it home. And the gamble certainly paid off, as he was delighted to discover it contained hundreds of historical clips of his hometown and best of all they were in stunning color. The film was produced by the Chicago Board of Education with help from United Airlines and is accompanied by a traditional 1940s-style voice over. 'Chicago, a city of beauty, strength and power', it declares. 'Chicago, commercial capital of the nation, agricultural market and industrial center of the world. Chicago, the most American of American cities.' 'City of beauty, strength and power': The film was produced by the Chicago Board of Education with help from United Airlines . Those were the days: Just a few cars make their way through the city's streets which today would be clogged with traffic . Out and about: Two women take a walk Downtown on a glorious day in 1940s Chicago . Mr Altman, 27, told the website dnainfo.com: 'I was curious. so I picked it up, and it turned out to be pretty cool.' The 32 minutes of footage shows scenes from all parts of the city including beaches, parks, factories, sporting events, universities and numerous views of downtown. It depicts a city in transformation, ready to embrace the modern age. One moment an old steam train creaks down the rails pulling a load of dirty old tankers, the next a gleaming new diesel locomotive is seen rolling out of Central Station.

The 32 minutes of footage shows scenes from all parts of the city including beaches, parks, factories, sporting events, universities and numerous views of downtown . Another scene shows hundreds of people packed onto one of the city's beaches to enjoy a sunny day. A marquee which appears to be for the 1945 Humphrey Bogart film 'Conflict', helps to date the footage. The film's narrator Johnnie Neblett died on September 15, 1946, and John Howatt, credited on the film as Chicago Board of Education's business manager, was elected to the post on january 8, 1945, which suggests the film must have been first released sometime between those two dates. Mr Altman transferred the film digitally and tweaked the colours slightly which he deemed to be a little too pink.

After tightening up the focus he uploaded the film onto the internet where it has been warmly received. The Chicago Board of Education is now trying to find out more about the film such as why it was made and who it was shown to. Mr Altman said the film was unusual as it ventures beyond Downtown into areas where visitors wouldn't likely go, like the steel plants in South Shore. He added: 'Back then, travel films were very popular; they'd be shown before your mainstream movies. This seems a bit different, which I thought was very interesting.'","Rare color footage discovered by a professional film and video colorist .

"By . Ben Spencer . Gardener’s growing interest in exotic and foreign plants is helping to save the threatened bumblebee, ecologists say. Growing a variety of plants creates a diverse ecosystem in a garden, which scientists say provides bees and other pollinating insects with a range of food sources. A new study suggests that the most common species of British bumblebees are not fussy about a plant’s origin when searching for nectar and pollen. A survey has found that British bumblebees have no preference on the type of flower they are extracting pollen from, making display gardens with oriental and exotic flowers a lifesaver for the species . Academics conducted a three-month survey in the gardens of a residential street in Plymouth. They found that of the six garden plants most commonly visited by bumblebees, only one - the Foxglove - was a British native. Common foreign plants favoured by the bees included trailing bellflower, which originates in the mountains of the Balkans, Hebe Franciscana, a hybrid bush bred from plants from New Zealand and South America, Deutzia shrubs from China, and lilac from California. The team, from Plymouth University, found that bees simply visited plants in proportion to flower availability. While study showed that most bees are not fussy about the origin of their nectar, some species have a preference for British plants, such as the long-tongued garden bumblebee, which chooses British and European plants for 78 per cent of its flower visits . Ecologist Dr Mick Hanley, lead author of the study published in the journal Annals of Botany, said this encouraged gardeners to cast their net wide when choosing what to cultivate. ‘Urban gardens are increasingly recognised for their potential to maintain or even enhance biodiversity,’ he said. ‘In particular, the presence of large densities and varieties of flowering plants supports a number of pollinating insects whose range and abundance has declined as a consequence of agricultural intensification and habitat loss. ‘By growing a variety of plants from around the world, gardeners ensure that a range of food sources is available for many different pollinators. ‘But until now we have had very little idea about how the origins of garden plants actually affect their use by our native pollinators.’ The study showed that while most bees are not fussy about the origin of their nectar, some species have a preference for British plants. The long-tongued garden bumblebee, for example, chose British and European plants for 78 per cent of its flower visits, a preference developed over thousands of years. Dr Hanley said that as a general rule bees would go wherever there are flowers available. But if native plants such as the foxglove disappeared completely, some species would be at risk. He said: ‘In addition to growing truly native plants like foxgloves, where possible, gardeners can help native pollinators by setting aside a small area to allow native brambles, vetches, dead nettles, and clovers to grow. ‘But as long as some native species are available in nearby allotments, parks, or other green spaces, a combination of commonly-grown garden plants from all around the globe will help support our urban bumblebees for future generations.’","Most British bees are not fussy about the plant when they collect pollen .

"Ted Terry has been cleared of racist abuse at the Old Bailey . The father of Chelsea captain John Terry has been cleared of racist abuse at the Old Bailey. Ted Terry, 59, had been accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette. Speaking outside court Terry said he felt 'relieved' at the verdict. The court heard that Terry and two friends got into a confrontation over a cigarette with Mr Talafair and his friends outside The Windsor pub near Fenchurch Street station on March 22 last year. Both groups had been drinking in the pub to celebrate birthdays, the court heard. Giving evidence, Terry admitted putting his face against Mr Talafair's and calling him a 'f***** tight p****', but denied headbutting him or saying 'f****** Paki, let's have it right here and now'. The father of two and grandfather of six told the jury: 'I just said 'F*** off, go back downstairs', things like that. It wasn't no racist stuff.' Mr Talafair told the jury that he had suffered no injury from Terry's headbutt because he was able to get out of the way in time. He admitted calling Terry a 'fat bald p****' during the stand-off. The alleged victim reported the incident to police the following day after researching Terry online. He asked officers about taking his story to the press, but was told it would hamper the investigation, the court heard. Thumbs up: Ted Terry shows his relief after being cleared at the Old Bailey . Son: John Terry in action for Chelsea against Galatasaray on Tuesday night . Honour: John Terry captained England in two separate spells and was a vocal leader on the pitch . The jury of seven men and five women has heard that the Chelsea captain's father received a 24-month conditional discharge for common assault in 2005 and a suspended prison sentence for an offence of supplying class A drugs in 2010. Two months after being arrested for racially aggravated assault in March last year, Terry admitted racially abusing another man. He was fined £200 for saying 'f****** Irish p****' during a bust-up at Barking railway station, the court heard. Terry, from Grays in Essex, denies one count of racially-aggravated common assault and one count of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence. Niland, of Quarles Park Road in Romford, Essex, and Musteata, of Tarves Way in Greenwich, south east London, deny one count each of racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

"By . Associated Press . A Bitcoin trader that went bankrupt after claiming hackers had stolen $488million of the digital currency has found almost a quarter of the missing haul... in one of its own accounts. Online currency exchange Mt. Gox declared itself insolvent in February claiming BTC850,000  ($488million) had gone missing, most likely as a result of theft. But in a humiliating U-turn today, the Tokyo-based firm revealed administrators have unearthed BTC200,000 ($115million) on March 7 in one of its 'old format' digital wallets. Anger: Bitcoin trader Kolin Burges stands in protest outside Mt. Gox's offices in Tokyo after it claimed to have lost BTC850,000 last month . The announcement was made on the group's website by its head, Mark Kapeles, who said the bitcoin stash was found in a bitcoin wallet that was using one of the older formats, and therefore escaped the exchange's initial searches. The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall. We found it: The announcement was made on the group's website by its head, Mark Kapeles, who said the bitcoin stash was found in a bitcoin wallet that was using one of the older formats, and therefore escaped the exchange's initial searches . Bitcoins: The price of Bitcoins has been volatile . It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange. Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. Its popularity soared at the end of last year as websites, shops and pubs around the world began accepting it as a form of payment, while US regulators clamped down on those using it to buy drugs and illegal goods. The value of a single Bitcoin broke through the $1,000 barrier for the first time at the end of November, having been worth around $120 for most of the year. Bitcoin is now trading around $575. 'I am sorry for the troubles I have caused all the people,' Karpeles, a Frenchman, said in Japanese at a Tokyo court. Karpeles had not made a public appearance since rumors of the exchange's insolvency surfaced. The loss was a giant setback to the currency's image because its boosters have promoted bitcoin's cryptography as protecting it from counterfeiting and theft. Just hours before the bankruptcy filing, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso had scoffed that a collapse was only inevitable. 'No one recognizes them as a real currency,' he told reporters. 'I expected such a thing to collapse.' Japan's financial regulators have been reluctant to intervene in the Mt. Gox situation, saying they don't have jurisdiction over something that's not a real currency. Bitcoin proponents have insisted that Mt. Gox is an isolated case, caused by the company's technological failures, and the potential of virtual currencies remains great. At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $115 million. Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks. The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange. Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.

"By . Sam Webb . An horrific-looking creature with hundreds of vicious, needle-like teeth has been discovered by Chinese paleontologists. The unusual-looking beast, known as Atopodentatus unicus, lived in the middle Triassic approximately 240 million years ago and is a brand new species and genus. Dr Xiao-chun Wu, a palaeontologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, led the team that made the incredible discovery. Bizarre: The unusual-looking beast, known as Atopodentatus unicus, lived in the middle Triassic approximately 240 million years ago . Their find in the Guanling Formation in Southwest China was published in Naturwissenschaften. Atopodentatus unicus belongs to the sauropterygians, a group of aquatic reptiles that developed from land ancestors and flourished during the Mesozoic before they became extinct at the end of the era. The fossilized skeleton was nearly complete, with just the right side of the skull missing, and from its snout to its tail, the creature was about 3 metres (9 feet) long. Science is Awesome reports that the teeth were arranged in 35 sets in a vertical pattern in the centre of the upper jaw, resembling a cleft palate. It would have been too thin and brittle to attack and consume large prey and were most likely to have been used to filter sea worms and other small creatures from the ocean floor. The unusual shape of the jaw  probably helped scoop up food that the teeth filtered out.","Unusual aquatic reptile used teeth to filter food from bottom of sea .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The popularity of various logo quiz apps on phones and tablets is testament to how customers relate so much to a brand based on its logo design. Psychologists recently found logos are so hardwired into our brains we can identify them from the age of two, and young children can link products to logos in 67 per cent of cases. In response to this, a pair of researchers from Chicago have studied some of the world’s most popular logos and plotted how they make people feel, based on colour psychology. Researchers from Chicago studied the associations logos and their colours have with customers and created an inforgraphic. For example, companies with green logos, including Google and Starbucks pictured, are seen as trustworthy, helpful, and relaxed . Red: Associated with intensity, passion and aggressiveness. Examples: YouTube and Red Bull . Blue: Associated with trust, confidence, and 'depth and stability of the sky and sea' Examples: Samsung and Ford . Yellow: Associated with joy and energy. Examples: Ferrari and McDonalds . Green: Associated with the 'harmony of nature', relaxation and hope. Examples: Android and Starbucks . Purple: The colour purple is linked to the ‘luxury of royalty’. Example: by Cadbury, FedEx and Yahoo. Orange: Associated with feelings of enthusiasm and creativity. Examples: Mozilla’s Firefox and Fanta. Pink: Associated with feminine traits, warmth, love and nurturing. Examples: Barbie, LG . Black: Bold, luxurious and associated with . the ‘formality and mystery of the night’. Examples: BlackBerry and Tiffany and Co. Brown: Dependable and reliable. Example: UPS and M&Ms . Colour psychology has been used for years to establish how different hues affect people’s emotions and mood. Although it varies from person to person, psychologists and researchers have found some common threads. For example, blue is the most popular colour in America, followed by green, purple and red. The popularity of blue and green has been linked to nature and habitats, and may date back to a time when we lived outside. Colour preference can even change depending on the temperature. People who usually prefer red and orange, for example, may choose cooler colours including blue and white when they’re body temperature is higher than normal. Traditionally, men are thought to prefer reds, oranges and yellows, while women prefer blue, greens and pinks. Researchers discovered customers tend to make a judgment on a product within 90 seconds of seeing it, and between 62 per cent and 90 per cent of this judgement is based on colour. Alex Hillsberg, from Financesonline.com, who conducted the research, said: ‘Some logos are so powerful that they don’t need to spell out their names, or that they transcend cultural borders. ‘Iconic logos are masters of subtleties and understatements. We know it’s not set in stone, but colours can evoke a specific emotional response from us. ‘Red means active, yellow is energetic, blue is reliable, green is nature, and so on. Colour psychology has been used for years to establish how different hues affect people's emotions. Traditionally, men are thought to prefer reds, oranges and yellows, pictured, while women prefer blue, greens and pinks. McDonald's yellow arches, pictured right, are associated with joy and energy . According to Hillsberg's infographic, the colour purple is linked to the 'luxury of royalty' and is used by Cabdury, but also FedEx and Yahoo, pictured . ‘In fact, it doesn’t stop at the obvious; researchers at the University of Rochester in New York believe red can actually ‘keep us from performing our best on tests.’ According to Hillsberg’s infographic, red is also associated with intensity and feelings of passion and aggressiveness.

"By . Emma Innes . A teenage girl who glued on false nails lost the top of her finger after it rotted away. Sarah Greenaway, 17, applied her own false nails at home with cosmetic DIY glue bought in Boots - but days later she was rushed to hospital with a serious infection. Bar worker Miss Greenaway was in agony as the index finger on her right hand turned green and started dying. Sarah Greenaway, 17, had to have the tip of her finger amputated after it became severely infected. The index finger became infected after she used some nail glue that she bought from Boots . Doctors had to cut off the top of the finger to save her hand - and cut the finger open from tip to palm to clean it out. Miss Greenaway bought the Â£3.20 Broadway Jet Dry Nail Glue at a Boots store in Pontypool, South Wales. She said: 'I bought the glue for a set of nails I had at home already. All I wanted was for my nails to look nice. 'But later the next day my finger was really hurting, so I took the nails off. 'My nail had turned a greeny-black colour underneath. 'I went to A&E and they gave me antibiotics. But when they didn't work I was rushed in for surgery. Miss Greenaway went to hospital with a severe infection in her nail (left). She had to have surgery to remove the tip of her finger (right) and save the rest of it. She also had to have the whole finger opened up and cleaned . Miss Greenaway was also given IV antibiotics to combat the infection . 'It was very frightening - I was crying in pain, it was so scary.' Miss Greenaway had an hour-long operation and was kept in hospital for observation. She said: 'The pain was still so bad and I was put on a drip for antibiotics. 'Doctors didn't know then if they'd saved my finger. They said it might still have to be amputated.' While she was in recovery, Miss Greenaway contracted the serious bacterial infection MRSA and had to spend a further two nights in an isolated cubicle at Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. The teenager, of Pontypool, is now having physiotherapy sessions to help with getting the use of her finger back. While Miss Greenaway was in hospital after the operation she also developed MRSA . She said: 'I cannot understand how my finger became so infected. It may have been a bad batch of glue and we are thinking about taking legal action.' Her mother, Gayle Druce, 40, said: 'It was difficult to see Sarah in such pain. 'It was such a relief that she didn't lose her whole finger. 'For a long time her right hand was very touch sensitive and caused lots of pain, even just placing her finger flat down was terribly sore.' Now the teen has vowed that she will never wear false nails again. A spokesman for Boots said: 'It is a matter for the manufacturer. We don't feel able to comment at this time as the customer may pursue a legal case.' Sarah (pictured in hospital) said: 'Doctors didn't know then if they'd saved my finger. They said it might still have to be amputated' However, a skin and beauty therapist told MailOnline that it is most likely that the infection was not caused by the glue, but that it was caused by poor nail preparation before the glue was applied. Louise Thomas-Minns, who owns U And Your Skin, said: 'It's likely to be to do with the application process and the care of the nail. 'I always get very worried about these at home treatments. It's really unfortunate, and I have massive sympathy for that, but it is probably down to her ability in applying it. 'If there is water under the nail that could give rise to an infection. As with many things, its usually consumer error and not being equipped with the right knowledge. 'If the glue hasn't bonded properly, or the nail is wet or dirty before the glue is applied, it allows infection to breed.' She added that people should always ensure their nails are clean and free of dirt and oil before false nails are applied. Sarah (pictured with her mother, Gayle Druce) is considering taking legal action against the glue's manufacturer. Image shows how her finger looks now that it has recovered from the amputation .","Sarah Greenaway, 17, applied false nails and developed a finger infection .

"By . Ted Thornhill . You might be forgiven for thinking that this is a beach hut that’s being rescued after being washed out to sea. But it’s actually a luxurious hut worth £40,000 that’s being towed on the water to an exclusive sandy spit because it was too big to be driven there. The timber chalet, that measures 13ft by 13ft, was transported using the unconventional method to Mudeford Spit, Dorset, which is home to Britain’s most expensive beach huts. Water sight: A luxurious new beach hut is towed by boat to an exclusive sandy spit in Dorset . Wood you believe it? The timber chalet, that measures 13ft by 13ft, was transported using the unconventional method to Mudeford Spit . Well appointed: The hut has a lounge area, dining table, surround sound system, outlets to plug in electrical equipment, and the fixture for a TV to be installed . The remote sandbank, where huts sell for around £150,000, can only be accessed by boat or along a narrow road that is also used by a novelty land train. The owners of the new hut had to pay for it to be lifted onto the back of a small barge and towed down the River Stour, across Christchurch Harbour to Mudeford. Once the hut arrived on the peninsula it was lowered into place by a crane and is now nestled between two others. Exclusive: The beach hut is one of 350 at Mudeford which are the most expensive in the country . Stuff of dreams: The hut can sleep up to six people on a double and two single beds on a mezzanine level in the loft space . The luxury structure, made from cedar wood, was built off-site and has a kitchen area that comes with full-size fridge-freezer, a four ring hob, gas oven and a sink. It has a lounge area, dining table, surround sound system, outlets to plug in electrical equipment, and the fixture for a TV to be installed. There is no mains electricity or water but it does have two solar panels that power a 12 volt battery, providing power and hot water using a pump. It can sleep up to six people on a double and two single beds on a mezzanine level in the loft space and two on sofa-beds in the lounge but a local bylaw restricts overnight stays there from Easter through to Autumn. A communal shower block on the sandbank provides the owners with toilet and washing facilities. The hut has been constructed by Ecologic Developments for an unnamed couple in their 40s who have two young children. Pricey: Some of the huts at Mudeford Spit sell for around £150,000 on average because of the stunning views of the Solent . Mudeford Spit is located on the far east of Dorset's southern coastline, offering stunning views of the Solent . Peter Samson, 34, owner of Ecologic Developments, said: ‘This beach hut is bigger than the standard, which usually measure 10ft by 15ft. ‘Because of the size it was too big to take on the narrow road so we decided to float it over by boat, it was the first time we have done this and it went really well. ‘This hut was built to replace one that was on the plot previously because the owners wanted to update it. ‘It is fully fitted internally and all that is left to do is put in the soft furnishings. ‘It has a 12 volt electricity system running from solar panels which charge up batteries, from that you can run things such as a refrigerator and water heating. ‘It also has a water pump, surround sound system, sockets to charge electrical items and the fixture for a TV. The owners are delighted.’ This beach hut is one of 350 at Mudeford, which are the most expensive in the country. They sell for around £150,000 on average because of the stunning views of the Solent. One of Mudeford Spit's huts was put on the market for £180,000 last summer and sold within days. Meanwhile, Chalet number 4, on Beach Road, in . West Bexington, Dorset, became one of the world's most expensive beach . huts when it sold for £235,000 in 2006 . The felt-roof hut had a sitting . room measuring 2.85m by 2.59m, a kitchen which was 1.3m by 4.11m, a . toilet and one bedroom measuring 2.87m x 2.62m. It had running water, drainage and . mains electricity, a garden, the potential for off-site parking and can . be lived in all year round. The new owner won a heated five-way auction held in Sherborne, Dorset, to snap up the hut.","The timber chalet was transported using the unconventional method to exclusive Mudeford Spit in Dorset .

"By . Adrian Durham . After Tottenham won the north London derby at White Hart Lane last season, Andre Villas-Boas memorably declared Arsenal were 'in a negative spiral of results.' The Gunners promptly won eight and drew two of their final 10 games and snatched fourth place from AVB’s faltering flops. Some things in football never seem to change and Tottenham Hotspur being the laughing stock of the Premier League is one of them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sherwood's criticism of his team, and reaction after Arsenal win . Down and out: Andros Townsend (left) and Kyle Naughton are dejected after Tottenham's defeat by Arsenal . Derby delight: Arsenal celebrate Tomas Rosicky's stunning strike that proved to be the winner on Sunday . It is more than 50 years since they won the title, more than 20 years since they won an FA Cup and they've only had one season in the Champions League. These facts should leave all Tottenham fans embarrassed by their football club. They've been treated to some top quality players down the years, but none of them have turned Spurs into champions. The club has now appointed a manager, possibly temporarily, who, when things aren’t going his way, throws his jacket to the ground and hurls a ball full force at an opposition player - twice. I'm puzzled why the FA are ignoring Sherwood’s touchline actions on Sunday. How his players will get any discipline from him is a mystery. I suppose Sherwood thinks a few cheeky-chappy quips in the post-match press conference or a random blast at his players will be the answer. On top of that, Spurs have had a player in recent seasons, Benoit Assou-Ekotto, who admitted he played for the money and football wasn't his passion. 'It’s a job,' he said, humiliatingly for Spurs, especially as they willingly shovelled thousands of pounds into his bank account for several seasons. Spurs now have Sandro; a player who seems to show more care and precision with his hair than his passing. He gave the ball away for Arsenal’s goal on Sunday, got booked, substituted and actually contributed very little else to one of Spurs' biggest games of the season. Candidate for worst Premier League Brazilian ever? Possibly. Players like Assou-Ekotto and Sandro are revered by some fans because they are so 'quirky'. May I suggest Spurs need dedicated and talented professionals rather than characters? For a short time Harry Redknapp turned Spurs into a top-four club. They were also Champions League quarter-finalists. It now seems ridiculous that Spurs were so happy to let him go. Why didn’t the chairman do more to improve his relationship with Redknapp? The chairman is the one who can change things at White Hart Lane. The focus now is firmly on the stony-faced silent assassin – Daniel Levy. Is he doing his job properly? Does he have sufficient knowledge of the game to make the right decisions for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club? How's my hair looking? Tottenham don't need quirky players like Sandro (right) and Benoit Assou-Ekotto . Right man for the job? Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood throws the ball at Arsenal's Bacary Sagna . Temper, temper: Sherwood threw his gilet down in frustration during his side's defeat by Arsenal . Anger: Sherwood has struggled to deal with the pressures of managing in the Premier League . People said Spurs played well and didn’t deserve to lose to Arsenal. I disagree. Arsenal took the lead and let Spurs have possession knowing they didn’t have the ability to break the Gunners down. Spurs' passing was poor, their finishing horrendous and with more penetration needed, Sherwood bizarrely left Aaron Lennon and Kyle Walker on the bench. In fact, Spurs looked weaker after the changes the manager did actually make. It was almost as if Arsenal were carrying out some sort of football experiment on Spurs, or worse still, they were teasing them. Spurs have been rubbish for too long. What have you got Daniel Levy? Do you know how to stop Spurs being so useless? Let’s see if you’re up to the job... In the firing line: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy may replace Sherwood in the summer . Not happy: Tottenham fans protest at Levy's handling of the club before the defeat by Arsenal on Sunday . Manchester United players have underperformed this season and their manager has proved to be lacking in man-management skills as well as tactical knowledge. But did you ever see a United side with such awful discipline? Marouane Fellaini caught Luis Suarez's calf early on, and was lucky to get away with it. Rafael was despicably late on Steven Gerrard and was rightly booked. They gave away three penalties – perhaps Daniel Sturridge went down easily for the third, but it was a poorly-timed, ill-advised lunge from Vidic. Arguably there should have been two more spot-kicks; Fellaini and Phil Jones on Suarez in the first half was debatable but Michael Carrick tripping Sturridge in the second half was a stonewall penalty. And just before Jones' ridiculous challenge on Joe Allen for the penalty at the start of the second half, Fellaini bundled recklessly into Suarez in the penalty area. Rafael should have been sent off; Vidic was dismissed. Why are well-paid professional footballers at a giant club like Manchester United making such poor decisions on the pitch? Not given: Marouane Fellaini  (right) and Phil Jones challenge Luis Suarez at Old Trafford . Down he goes: Jones fouled Joe Allen for Liverpool's second of three penalties at Old Trafford . Lunging in: Nemanja Vidic fouled Daniel Sturridge and was shown a second yellow card . Fury: Vidic screams at Sturridge after the penalty is awarded but is then sent off by Mark Clattenburg . Wembley is supposed to be a special place, isn’t it? So should the play-off, FA Trophy and Johnstone’s Paint finals all be played there? I must declare an interest here; my team is Peterborough United, and we are going to Wembley for the JP Trophy final on March 30. I have bought tickets already, I will be there with my son and I will thoroughly enjoy the day (if we win). On top of that, I’ve seen Posh win twice at Wembley before – we’ve got a 100 per cent record there, in fact. I celebrated both victories wildly. But that doesn’t change my view that the small-time lower league and even non-League finals should not be played at Wembley Stadium. I love our striker Britt Assombalonga, but this will be his second game at Wembley, yet he’s only 21 and has started only two games above League One level. Been there, done that: Crewe players celebrate with the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . He lost the final of the same . competition last year when he was on loan at Southend. Crewe were . winners that day which means Arsenal youngster Chuks Aneke, on loan with . the Alex last season and this, has been a Wembley winner at club level . more times than fellow Gooners Jack Wilshere, Laurent Koscielny, Santi . Cazorla and Mikel Arteta combined. Wembley occasions are wonderful, but . it should be for true showpiece games – FA Cup and League Cup finals, . the Championship play-off final, England games, and the Community . Shield. For me, working your way through a sea of League One and League Two mediocrity should not be rewarded with a trip to Wembley. But . that’s the way it is – I can’t change that, so I will be there . supporting my team. If I let my heart rule my head for a moment, then I . think it’s magical that the club I love is allowed to play at Wembley – I . can’t wait! Wembley veteran: Britt Assombalonga will play his second game at the national stadium at the age of 21 . In reality though, we all know Peterborough United vs Chesterfield doesn’t really belong at the national stadium. A word of warning though: having watched Posh put in a totally inept display last week at home to Bristol City – they were so bad I refused to celebrate our goal – I can only hope my team doesn’t disgrace Wembley. Some great players never got the chance to play at the home of football, so it doesn’t seem right to me that there are an endless number of journeymen lower league footballers with far less talent and ability who have had the honour and privilege. They are lucky guys, so I really hope none of them take their good fortune for granted. Come on Posh! We're going to Wembley! Peterborough prepare for their Johnstone's Paint Trophy final . Congratulations to Arsene Wenger on reaching 1,000 games this weekend. But it’s an empty, meaningless milestone. The first 500 games included all the trophies. So the 500 since have been relatively unsuccessful. Incidentally his 500th game was also at Chelsea – the Gunners lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho’s side. That was just a couple of months after Wenger last picked up a trophy, the FA Cup in 2005. The truth is Wenger shouldn’t have been allowed to reach 1,000 games at Arsenal. No other big club would have tolerated such failure over such a long period of time. Milestone: Arsene Wenger will take charge of his 1,000th game when Arsenal visit Chelsea at the weekend .","Tottenham's lack of trophies should leave their fans feeling embarrassed .
The FA should be taking action against Tim Sherwood for his touchline antics .
Manchester United's discipline against Liverpool was shocking .
Peterborough might be in it, but should the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final be held at Wembley?
Arsene Wenger's last 500 games have yielded no silverware ."
"By . Mark Prigg . If you've ever dreamt of racing down the rapids and floating through the Grand Canyon, Google has made it a lot easier. The firm undertook one of its riskiest missions yet to capture 286 miles of the river, including the most dangerous rapids. To capture them, it mounted its multi-lens Street View camera on a dinghy before floating it down the river. Use the interactive Map below to explore the river . A team of rafters and runners combined to capture the images, taking the camera on the water and hikes close to the river. Three staff from American Rivers joined Google Maps on an eight-day float through the Grand Canyon in August 2013 to capture the river imagery. The Street View camera, on a special mount built for the raft, captured a full 360-degree photo sphere every few seconds. The team captured 286 miles of the river, from Lee’s Ferry to Pearce Ferry. Members of the team also wore the Street View Trekker camera to capture five popular side hikes, including the trail to the Nankoweap Granaries with a dramatic view overlooking the river. 'For 6 million years, the Colorado River has flowed through the heart of the desert southwest, its waters slowly carving out a canyon so vast it can be seen from space—yet so remote it didn’t appear on early maps of the region,' said Chris Williams, Senior Vice President of Conservation at American Rivers, who worked with Google on the project. 'It wasn’t until 1869, when John Wesley Powell led a small exploration party on a rafting trip, that the natural wonders of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon came fully into view. 'Now with Google Street View, you can ride the whitewater rapids, cruise the sleepy river bends, and discover the side canyons that make the Colorado River a treasured resource. ' The team captured 286 miles of the river, from Lee¿s Ferry to Pearce Ferry. A team of rafters and runners combined to capture the images, taking the camera on the water and hikes close to the river. 'Supported by the outfitter Arizona River Runners, three of us from American Rivers joined Google Maps on an eight-day float through the Grand Canyon in August 2013 to capture the river imagery. 'The Street View camera, on a special mount built for the raft, captured a full 360-degree photo sphere every few seconds. 'This allows users to “join the raft” and explore 286 miles of the river, from Lee’s Ferry to Pearce Ferry. Members of the team (and American Rivers!) also wore the Street View Trekker camera to capture five popular side hikes, including the trail to the Nankoweap Granaries with a dramatic view overlooking the river.' The addition is the first time Google Maps has used the Street View technology on a major whitewater river. The Street View camera, on a special mount built for the raft, captured a full 360-degree photo sphere every few seconds. The raft braved the rapids without capsizing . The project brings renewed attention to the wonder and beauty of the Grand Canyon, as well as the challenges facing the Colorado River’s health. American Rivers named the Colorado River America’s Most Endangered River in 2013 because of the threat of outdated water management, over-allocation and persistent drought. 'Thirty-six million people from Denver to Los Angeles drink Colorado River water,' said Williams. 'The river irrigates nearly four million acres of land, which grows 15 percent of the nation’s crops. Hikers also wore the Street View Trekker camera to capture five popular side hikes, including the trail to the Nankoweap Granaries with a dramatic view overlooking the river . 'Over-allocation and drought have placed significant stress on water supplies and river health, and the basin is facing another drought this summer. 'Lower river flows threaten endangered fish and wildlife, along with the $26 billion dollar recreation economy that relies on the Colorado River.' In conjunction with this launch, American Rivers is calling on President Obama and Congress to support federal programs that assist cities and farms in getting smarter about managing their water supplies.","Google's trekker camera was mounted on an inflatable - and paddled down the infamous 21 mile rapids .

The five-bedroom, five-bathroom apartment is located in the exclusive One Hyde Park - the most expensive block of flats in the world. It boasts five reception rooms, parking for two cars and panoramic views across the capital. A private landlord has put the flat on the rental market for £45,000-a-week or £195,000-a-month. That means a Briton on the average annual wage of £26,500 could stay for just three days in the stunning apartment before blowing their entire annual salary before tax. Over a 12-month period, any tenant will find themselves spending £2.34 million on rent - enough to buy a nine ‘average’ UK homes priced at £250,000. This is significantly greater than the £780,000 annual rent asked for by Phones4You billionaire John Caudwell for his Mayfair mansion which appeared in the media last week.

"By . Peter Allen . Thirty four Greenpeace activists were under arrest in France today after breaking into the country's oldest nuclear power plant to demand that it is closed. Up to 90 protestors stormed the Fessenheim installation, in the east of the country close to the city of Mulhouse and the Swiss border. They hung anti-nuclear banners from a dome of the plant with one reading: ‘Stop risking Europe’. Hundreds of riot police arrived at the site following the start of the protest, at around 5.30am, and arrests were made later in the morning. Fessenheim, which is considered unsafe by many, is run by energy giants EDF, which is set to build two reactors in Britain. Threat: A police officer is lowered from a helicopter onto the dome of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant in France after it was stormed by 90 Greenpeace activists . Outflanked: Greenpeace activists on rubber dinghies hold placards reading 'Stop Risking Europe!' as they speed past Fessenheim nuclear power plant . A spokesman for the company said: ‘Gendarmes have 56 activists under control and 34 have been arrested. There has been no impact on the security of the plant, which continues to function normally.’ President Francois Hollande has pledged to close Fessenheim by 2016, but Greenpeace wants its two 37 year old reactors to be shut now. France currently relies on nuclear power to produce 75 per cent of its electricity, but Mr Hollande has pledged to cut this figure to 50 percent. There have been ongoing concerns about the seismic safety of plants, especially since the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Catastrophic failure at the Japanese plant resulted in a meltdown of three of its six nuclear reactors, causing injuries to workers and creating huge health fears among people living nearby. Protesters unfurl a giant banner reading 'Stop Risking Europe' from the roof of Fessenheim nuclear power plant. They are demanding it is shut immediately . A police dingy sails towards the nuclear power station as a helicopter lowers an officer onto the power station's roof from where the Greenpeace activists have hung their banner . Target: Up to 90 protestors stormed the Fessenheim installation, in the east of the country close to the city of Mulhouse and the Swiss border . Row: President Francois Hollande has pledged to close Fessenheim by 2016, but Greenpeace wants its two 37 year old reactors to be shut now . The environmental organization says it wants to draw attention to the 'danger of aging nuclear power plants in Europe' A Greenpeace spokesman called for ‘plant closures across Europe’ to limit the dangers to public safety, and the huge cost associated with running the plants. Greenpeace activists regularly break into nuclear plants so as to highlight their concerns about them. Around 30 were arrested last July after getting into EDF’s Tricastin plant in the south of France. EDF plans to start operating the first new nuclear reactor at the Hinkley Point C site in England in 2023. Britain is counting on the construction of new nuclear plants to replace ageing and polluting power stations that are closing down over the coming years. A Greenpeace spokesman called for 'plant closures across Europe' to limit the dangers to public safety, and the huge cost associated with running the plants . Greenpeace activists regularly break into nuclear plants so as to highlight their concerns about them. Around 30 were arrested last July after getting into EDF's Tricastin plant in the south of France . Alexandra Harris from Britain, was one of 30 Greenpeace activists who were detained for two months after being arrested in the Arctic sea . The 34 Greenpeace activists arrested in France can expect a far less harrowing experience than their colleagues who were arrested by Russian troops in the Arctic Sea and sent to a rat-infested soviet-era prison. The group of 25 protesters, including six UK nationals, were held on board their ship the Arctic Sunrise following a protest against a Russian oil rig drilling in pristine Arctic waters. A team of heavily-armed Russian special forces soldiers abseiled onto the deck from a helicopter quickly taking over the ship. The environmentalists were forced to kneel with their hands on their heads as the soldiers pointed their weapons at them. The group were taken to the a prison in Murmansk, revealed to be infested with rats, where they were denied the right to call home or receive letters. Dutch female activist Faiza Oulahsen revealed in a letter that she was being held in 'in a dirty cell, alone, isolated from the rest'. She wrote: 'Once in a while a rat crawls across the floor. I've lost weight and am not sleeping too well, but I am still holding my head high.' British activist Alex Harris revealed that she tapped out messages to fellow inmates on radiator pipes in order to stay sane as she was forced to spend 23 hours a day alone in her cell. The group were charged with piracy and told they faced up to 15 years in prison, but the cahrges were later reduced to hooliganism. Eleven Nobel Peace Prize laureates wrote to Russian president Vladimir Putin calling for the original piracy charges to be dropped. Greenpeace said the 30 had done nothing wrong, and the group has launched a worldwide campaign to have them freed. They were held for two months before the charges were dropped and they were allowed to return home. Greenpeace has warned a spill in Arctic waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts.","Around 90 protestors stormed the Fessenheim nuclear power station close to the Swiss border .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Massachusetts mother has been jeered out of a movie theater because her autistic son was annoying patrons, one of whom called the young man 'retarded.' Emily Colson, from Duxbury, described the traumatic experience in a blog post, explaining how she, her stepmother and her 23-year-old son Max were yelled at by fellow cinema-goers until they were forced to leave the film, and then crowd applauded their exit. 'It was the sound of an angry mob chasing us away with their jeers and taunts,' she wrote. Shocking: Massachusetts mother Emily Colson was jeered out of a movie theater because her autistic son Max, pictured, was annoying patrons, one of whom called the young man 'retarded' Colson said in the blog that their problems started when Max, who often gets frightened at the beginning of movies, shrieked 'I want to go home,' during the first preview and said it again once the film started. 'We hadn't even gotten past the previews. I know most of us, as families of children with disabilities, have all these plans in mind, but we couldn't even get there,' she later told the Patriot Ledger. That's when the crowd turned on them. 'Are you going to make him be quiet?' one woman said, according to Colson's blog. When she was informed that Max had autism, the woman hit back, 'I know he is, but why should the rest of us have to suffer?' Her husband then allegedly chimed in with, 'If you don't make him be quiet I'm calling the manager.'

The popular event was expanded from a 94-seat cinema to one three times the size and has now sold out. 'I just thought that if it were my child, I would have to find a way to make this right for him,' Watson said. And this time Colson knows she can enjoy the movie with her son.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Hundreds of Britain’s best-loved Victorian buildings should undergo ‘urgent’ safety inspections to prevent a repeat of the ceiling collapse that hit London’s Apollo Theatre, according to an official report. Investigators found that the collapse in the West End last December, during which nearly 80 people were hurt, was caused because hessian fibres within the plaster holding up the ceiling had worn away. The calls come after an investigation into the collapse of the Apollo Theatre's ceiling last December . Some of Britain’s most famous landmarks, such as the Royal Opera House, are adorned with the same type of plasterwork, raising fears that they are also potentially dangerous. Westminster Council, which compiled the report into the Apollo collapse, urged English Heritage, the National Trust, the Health and Safety Executive and theatre owners to inspect buildings with such ceilings  as a ‘matter of urgency’. Architecture expert Jonathan Taylor predicted that hundreds of listed properties would need to be looked at and the cost could become ‘very expensive’. Mr Taylor warned: ‘Every major city will have a theatre or cinema with fibrous plaster ornament.’ 80 theatre goers were injured when the ceiling came down during a performance at the end of last year .","'Urgent' safety inspections should be carried out on Victorian buildings .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . 'Liar': Randy Garrison, 31, was arraigned on two charges of child abandonment after police say the Missouri man lied about trying to pull his toddler sons from a burning mobile home in December . A Missouri father who gave police a detailed account of how he heroically tried to save his two sons from a mobile home fire in December has been charged with abandoning them to die in the flames. Randy Garrison, 31, of Orrick, was arraigned Friday in Ray County on two charges of child abandonment in the deaths of 20-month-old Ashton Garrison and 3-year-old Roger Garrison. Prosecutors say Garrison lied when he told authorities he fought his way through flames and smoke to try to reach the boys in the midday blaze, tripped over a bungee cord and fell face-down into the fire. He also claimed to have ripped siding off the outside of the trailer and punched a hole through to try to reach his sons before being overcome by smoke. Investigators said in court documents that Garrison changed his story over several days of questioning. When pressed by investigators, the 31-year-old man allegedly admitted that he thought the fire was bigger than it actually was. 'Maybe I panicked, maybe I didn’t think, I don’t know,' Garrison allegedly said, according to Kansas City Star. Medical personnel said he did not have burns or carbon monoxide levels consistent with someone who had been involved in a fire the way he described, and his white T-shirt her no soot stains. Left for dead: Roger Garrison (left), 3, died in the fire and was coincidentally named after his uncle who died under similar circumstances; Ashton Garrison (right) was only 20-months when he perished in the flames . Ravaged: The Garrisons' mobile home in Orrick, Missouri, burned to the ground December 10, killing two young children . A firefighter said there was no damage to the outside of the trailer consistent with someone trying to force entry. Garrison . allegedly told an officer that a woman who also lived in the trailer . had threatened to kill him and his sons, and that he later said he . thought she had abducted his sons and they were not dead, according to . court documents. Garrison was being held Friday morning on $100,000 cash-only bond. The cause of the deadly fire has not been determined. In the days after the tragedy, Randy Garrison told Fox 4 how he awoke just after 11am December 10 to hear his sons screaming and the boys mother, Tammy Willis, was not home. Garrison arrived home from work that day at 6am after working a 24-hour shift and went directly to bed. He saw the boy's mother asleep with them on the couch. 'I woke up hearing them screaming at the top of their lungs,' he told the station. 'Flames in my bedroom and flames in the hallway, flames through the whole house.' Tammy Willis (left) and Randy Garrison(right) were not married but had two children together and lived together for the sake of their children . The home that burned down was entirely decimated and the cause of the fire in still unknown . Tammy's mother Marjorie Long claims that her daughter (right) pictured with her son Ashton, loved her children and would 'starve for them' The father described in great detail . how he tried to burst through his bedroom hall, and when he couldn't, he . ran into the hallway and tripped. Something may have been holding the . door to his children's bedroom shut. 'I . fell over a bungee cord or something that was holding their bedroom . door shut,' he said at the time. 'I ran out the back door around to the . front, started ripping the sheeting off the house and trying to punch . through that way and I couldn’t.' Garrison claims he didn't know that the boy's mother was leaving. The couple were not married but lived together for the sake of the children. 'The mother was in the house whenever I went to sleep this morning,' he said. 'And I woke up to her not being here, but my kids were here. You’d think a parent would either wake up another adult in the house or take the kids with her.' Father's fibs: Randy Garrison (right), pictured with his two children, told reporters at the time he was absolutely devastated that he was unable to save them from the flames . Panic: Randy Garrison conceded that he may have overestimated the magnitude of the fire and ran out . Garrison told reporters in December that his children were very important to him. 'They were my rock, everything I had in life,' Garrison said. 'The only reason I woke up everyday was for my boys.' 'What would go through your mind after hearing your kids scream bloody murder and basically watching them die in front of you?' he asked KCTV5.

"By . Luke Garratt . Three years after the devastating tsunami that killed more than 15,000 people, Japan is still in mourning of the event that ravaged coastal communities and triggered a nuclear crisis. In the anniversary ceremony, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to boost rebuilding efforts, after they have struggled to rebuild towns and villages, and clean up the radiation from the subsequent meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. Thanks to shortages of skilled workers and materials, reconstruction efforts, which have finally started getting on their way, are already somewhat delayed. Scroll down for videos .

People pray as they commemorate victims of Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in front of Kobe's light of hope memorial . The disaster, which took place in 2011, killed 15,884 and left 2,636 missing on the northeastern coast of Japan, and the country has set aside 25 trillion yen (£150 billion) for reconstruction efforts. Even after three years, nearly 270,000 people are displaced, with many coming from the Fukushima areas, where there is still heavy radioactive contamination, and many areas are still off limits. The plant, which is being decommissioned, a process expected to take 40 years, has stabilised significantly, but there are still often leaks of radioactive water, among other problems, which have delayed the plant's decommissioning.

He said: 'We must further speed up the reconstruction so that everyone affected by . the disasters can return to ordinary life as soon as possible.' During a ceremony in Tokyo, officials and representatives of the survivors observed a minute's silence to mark the moment, at 2:46 p.m., when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off the Tohoku coast, the strongest quake recorded in Japan's history. On March 11 Japan commemorated the third anniversary of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that claimed more than 15,000 lives . Police officers observe a minute of silence on in Ukedo, Japan . Abe promised to move communities along the coast to higher ground to avoid future tsunamis, and build thousands more public housing units within a year in the Iwate and Miyagi areas of Japan. Emperor Akihito, who attended the ceremony, said that his heart breaks when he thinks of the Fukushima residents who have no idea if they can ever return home. He said: 'Many disaster survivors are still experiencing difficulties. A woman from Tokyo visits the heavily damaged Disaster Control Center building where scores of people were killed following the tsunami in Minamisanriku . 'It is important that all people of Japan unite their hearts and stand by each other for a long period so that they can live without losing their hopes and in good health.' In northern Japan, tsunami survivors held their own memorial events for their loved ones. People observe a moment of silence in front of what is left of a disaster control center in Minamisanriku, Miyagi prefecture . In the once-bustling fishing town of Minamisanriku, local residents gathered at what used to be the town's disaster prevention center, where dozens of citizens died in the tsunami. The residents prayed in front of a small table filled with flowers, a Buddha statue and incense. Much of the town's coastal area remains deserted, except for a few structures that survived.

Katsuo Izumi, who lost his wife in the tsunami, said his disaster-hit town of Higashi-Matsushima has seen some rebuilding of public housing, schools and other facilities. Altogether, the city lost 1,000 residents. He said: 'We survivors have a responsibility to live a full life on behalf of those who perished in the tsunami.

"By . Maria Lewis . An Australian film director's latest project has been surrounded by an eerie case of life imitating art, as it is based around a plane crash on a China-bound flight. Alister Grierson, who is best known for his film Sanctum, is in the early stages of production for action/adventure movie Deep Water, as the air search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 continues. It's not the first time one the director's films has mirrored a real life disaster, and two weeks before Sanctum's release (a film about an underwater cave diving expedition gone wrong), Australia was hit by disastrous floods. Cinematic coincidences: Australian filmmaker Alister Grierson is directing Deep Water, pictured at Tropfest LA in 2012 . Now Deep Water will follow the fates of passengers who survive a plane crash on a Beijing-bound flight. The Gold Coast-based filmmaker said he couldn't deny the strange timing between his project and the real-life drama of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH3L0. But despite saying it was 'mysterious', he insists that his film is vastly different. He told MailOnline: 'The similarities and timing is interesting and I can see why anecdotally the two things link up, it's a tricky thing. 'But in simple terms, Deep Water is about an accident that happens on an airplane which goes down in the ocean, and the survivors trying to stay alive afterwards. 'It's more complicated than that as there's villains and sharks, but it's a fun action/adventure with thrills and spills and scares. Flashback film: (L - R) Alister Grierson, James Cameron and Andrew Wight on the set of Sanctum in 2011 . 'Nobody knows what has happened with the Malaysian airplane. We're yet to find out whether it will be revealed as a malfunction or even found.' Grierson and Australian production company Arclight Films began pre-production on Deep Water at Village Roadshow Studios in Queensland weeks before the real-life incident. He said it will be some two years before the film hits cinemas, allowing enough plenty of space between the true story currently unfolding. It's not the first time the veteran filmmaker has had life imitate art. His first big budget feature Sanctum - executive produced by Avatar filmmaker James Cameron - was two weeks out from release when Queensland and Northern New South Wales were hit by devastating floods in 2011. 'The floods came through and destroyed whole areas, with people losing their lives,' he said. Sanctum scares: A scene from Alister Grierson's underwater thriller . 'We had this weird situation where we were about to release a film where there's flooding and people drown. 'It was strange territory.' Grierson said Deep Water is shaping up to be a co-production with China, who also worked with the same Australian crew on kitsch shark thriller Bait with Sharni Vinson and Julian McMahon. 'We've nicknamed it Bait 2 because there's a lot of the same crew and even themes, but it's a stand alone story.' His next project Parer's War - about the real-life story of Australian war photographer Damien Parer - goes to air on April 27 on ABC. Meanwhile, search planes flying deep into the Indian Ocean this weekend found nothing that could be from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet after a second day scanning the seas, Australia's acting prime minister said on Saturday. The planes are part of an international effort to solve the nearly two-week-old mystery of what happened to flight MH370 which vanished with 239 people on board.

A new account with the handle @LIPartyStories is causing outrage in Nassau and Suffolk counties, with local teens snapping pictures of themselves at house parties which are then retweeted to the account's more than 22,000 followers. Unsurprisingly, the pictures are not the kind of images any parent wants to see of their children posted online. Incriminating: A Twitter account has been reposting pictures of Long Island teens underage drinking . Wide reach: The teens take snaps of themselves underage drinking and then send them to the account which in turn retweets them to its more than 22,000 followers . Not suitable behavior: Many Long Island parents are concerned these pictures will get in the way of their children getting into college or getting a job . 'Kids do stupid things. We've probably all done stupid things, now you've got social media to be able to publish to the world how dumb you are forever,' Port Washington parent Peter Winick told CBS New York. The images posted to the account run the gamut of a fairly innocuous shot of two girls shotgunning beers to students stripping down for no apparent reason. Since teens have been underage drinking since the dawn of time, the resulting images are pretty unsurprising. Recent posts include several students peeing in unconventional places like a sink or the corner of a dining room. Drunk stories: Some of the pictures are fairly innocuous, like the girls on the left shotgunning beers, or the picture on the right of two boys showing up to the party with a cheetah statue . Sick: But others are more concerning, like the several shots of high schoolers throwing up. This girl made it into a waste bin - many do not . When you have to go, you have to go: Many of the high-schoolers didn't have the patience to wait for an empty bathroom . When the teens have had too much to drink, they usually end up either throwing up (both successfully making it into the toilet, and many times not), or passing out. If they make the mistake to fall asleep before everyone else does, they are usually subjected to such pranks as being surrounded by beer bottles or drawn upon. In addition to concerns about the teens' health, local parents also think these pictures may come back to haunt their children when they apply for colleges or a job. Tired: When the teens have had too much to drink, they usually pass out before finding a bed . Don't move! This teen is in for a surprise when he awakes from his drunken nap . Shouldn't have gone to sleep: The girl who passed out in this photo had crude images scrawled on her face and arm including the phrase 'This is what friends are for' Marg Lee works for DEDICATEDD, a nonprofit organization that educates teens abou the dangers of drinking and driving. 'Once it’s out in cyberspace there’s no taking it back,' Lee told CBS. 'If an employer is going to be looking for someone to represent their company you’re not going to want somebody that’s been all over the web.' Authorities in Suffolk County say they know about the Twitter account, but it will only be used as part of a larger investigation if someone files a complaint. And it doesn't look like the Twitter account is going anywhere. After media coverage of the account this week, the administrator tweeted: 'The news was trying to get people to unfollow @LIPartyStories all they did was help spread the word.'","Parents are concerned about the incriminating party pictures being posted on @LIPartyStories .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Bought by a family in Kosovo when she was just three weeks old and kept illegally in an apartment, Ema the bear cub's future looked bleak. And lonely. But this is actually the tale of three little bears, with a happy ending. Three weeks later, not only did local police rescue Ema from the flat in Peja, she has also been introduced to two other cubs - of the same age, and discovered in the same town - who are probably her brothers. Three bear cubs rescued from two family homes in Kosovo may actually be related . The female cub, Ema (above), was bought by a family in the city of Peja when she was just three weeks old and kept illegally in their apartment . Ema, who weighs less than 7lb, is currently being nursed back to health by workers from Four Paws charity . The authorities first became aware of the case after the family posted details on Facebook outlining how they acquired and kept the young bear. Last Wednesday, police and the Environment Ministry staff confiscated the female brown bear cub. And yesterday, the other two cubs - which have been named Ron and Oska - were found at another family's home in the same city, in the west of Kosovo. A health check will now be carried out to determine whether the three are siblings. The trio are currently being looked after by the international animal welfare organisation Four Paws at its bear sanctuary in Prishtina. Two other cubs, named Osca and Ron, were also rescued from Kosovo and are the same age as Ema . Charity workers think the trio could be related but will have to carry out further medical checks to be certain . The bears, who are weak and underweight, are being nursed back to health using cat milk and honey . 'The Environment Ministry and police acted in exactly the right way, by seizing the cubs immediately and informing us', said Four Paws project leader Carsten Hertwig. 'We’re calling for the animal dealers who sold little Ema to be found and brought to justice. 'There should also be legal action against the family which bought and kept the bear illegally.' Since autumn 2010, the private keeping of brown bears has been banned in Kosovo. In 2013, Four Paws established the sanctuary in Prishtina for Kosovo’s 15 illegally held restaurant bears. In the wild, brown bears usually spend two years with their parents, and removing them early is harmful . Privately owning and keeping brown bears has been illegal in Kosovo since autumn 2010 . Four Paws has set up a sanctuary for Kosovo's 15 'restaurant bears', so called because they were previously kept in cages and used to entertain people outside restaurants and supermarkets . With the help of the Kosovo Environment Ministry, the police and peace-keeping force KFOR, the organisation was able to rescue 13 bears and transfer them to safety. However, two bears were killed by their owner just before their planned rescue, and thrown onto a scrap heap. Hertwig is appalled that another case of illegal bear keeping has now come to light. Being snatched from their mother while still young could seriously damage a cub's health. In the wild, young bears spend at least two years with their mother. Owners have previously taken drastic measures to avoid being caught, including one who killed two 15-month-old bears in 2013 before dumping their bodies on a scrap heap . Four Paws charity are calling for legal action against the family who kept Ema, and the dealers who sold her . 'The cubs have had some cat milk and a bit of honey,' said Hertwig. 'But they seem very stressed, fearful and extremely weak – Ema doesn’t even weigh 3kg. 'We hope the rescue was in time, and that with our expert care the cubs can pull through and recover.'","Ema, a brown bear, was rescued from a family in Kosovo .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Chicago felon with a lengthy rap sheet faces hate crime and murder charges after he allegedly harassed an African-American man and his daughter before beating the man to death earlier this week. Michael Tingling, 58, was walking his 15-year-old daughter, Masharah, home from school - as he often did - when the two were approached by 59-year-old Joseph Firek in the 7100-block of North Clark Street in Chicago on Wednesday afternoon. Firek, prosecutors say, brushed up against Mashara as they passed each other in their Rogers Park neighborhood, where Michael Tingling - a former boxer - was a well-liked, respected member of the community. Proud papa: Michael Tingling was walking his 15-year-old daughter home from school when they were accosted by Joseph Firek . Felon: 59-year-old Joseph Firek has a lengthy criminal record and was out on parole when he attacked Tingling . '[Firek] was staring at me up and down, eyeballing me and everything....and . then my dad, being a father, he got protective and put me behind . him...he told the guy to go away,' Masharah told WLS. As Tingling was attempting to protect his daughter, Firek allegedly pushed him and began yelling racial slurs. 'The defendant looked at the victim and said, ""What's up n******."" The . victim pulled his daughter behind him,"" Cook County Assistant State's . Attorney Glendon Runk said in court. Beloved: Tingling, a former boxer, was loved and respected in his Rogers Park neighborhood . Firek, authorities say, then started punching Tingling - who suffered from diabetes and heart problems - in the chest before he and his daughter were able to escape to a nearby store and call police. But Firek followed them - and Tingling collapsed. '[Firek was] like, ""I hope he's okay, I hope I didn't kill him."" And he's . telling me to calm down. I told him you have no right to tell me to calm . down...because that's my dad,' Masharah said. Tingling, who had a pacemaker to treat his heart condition, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital shortly after the altercation. His death was ruled a homicide. Heartbroken: Tingling's daughter, Masharah, is heartbroken over the senseless death of her father . Firek, who was on parole following one of many burglary convictions, suffers from mental illness, his public defender argued, and received outpatient care at a nearby psychiatric center. Firek's been charged with first-degree murder as a hate crime and is being held on a $250,000 bond. Masharah Tingling, meanwhile, is without a father. 'I want my Dad back. I really want my Daddy,' she said. 'That man took my dad away from me...and now my dad can't see me go to . 8th grade graduation...and that's all he ever wanted to do was see me . graduate,' Masharah continued.","Michael Tingling was walking his daughter home from school when they were approached by 59-year-old felon Joseph Firek .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Not guilty plea: Two Oklahoma teenagers charged in the alleged 'thrill kill' of Australian baseball player Christopher Lane, pictured, in Oklahoma pleaded not guilty and waived their right to a speedy trial Thursday . Two Oklahoma teenagers charged in the . alleged 'thrill kill' of an Australian baseball player in Oklahoma . pleaded not guilty and waived their right to a speedy trial Thursday. Michael . Dewayne Jones, 18, and Chancey Allen Luna, 16, wore orange jail . jumpsuits and their hands were cuffed as Judge . Joe Enos set a trial date of August 18. The teens are charged . with first-degree murder in the shooting death last summer of . 22-year-old Christopher Lane. Prosecutors . say Lane, from Melbourne, was gunned down as he jogged near his . girlfriend's parents' house in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma . City. He was preparing to enter his senior season as a catcher at East . Central University in Ada. Another . teenage defendant, James Francis Edwards Jr., 16, agreed to testify . against Jones and Luna if prosecutors reduce charges against him. Edwards . testified at the preliminary hearing for Luna and Jones last month that . he was rolling joints in the front passenger seat when Luna fired the . fatal shot from the back while Jones drove. Luna and Jones both said they had believed the gun used in the killing held blanks, not a live round, Edwards testified. Edwards . was charged with accessory after the fact because prosecutors say he . made a phone call from the Stephens County Jail between August 16 and . December 31, 2013, and asked someone to dispose of the weapon. He is due back in court in May for a preliminary hearing for that charge. Bad aim: Michael Jones, shown left on March 12, reportedly told an inmate that he and his friends tried to shoot several people the day they killed Lane but 'kept missing' Trial: Chancey Luna, shown left on March 12, and Michael Jones were in court for a hearing before their murder trial for allegedly shooting Chris Lane. This Thursday a date was set for the trial . Prosecutors . have said they will drop the first-degree murder charge in exchange for . him continuing to testify against the other two teenagers through . trial. A lawyer for Jones has filed a motion seeking all agreements between the state and witnesses, specifically Edwards. Family . members for both teens were in attendance Thursday, as was Lane's . distraught girlfriend. All left without comment following the hearing. A gag order prevents lawyers and others from discussing the case outside of court. Last week, the Oklahoma court was told that one of the three teenagers accused of . murdering Lane said they tried to shoot . other people 'but kept missing.' Heather . George, who works at the Stephens county jail where the three teenagers . were held after Lane was killed, testified on March 12 that she had . overheard a conversation between two inmates, one of whom was Michael Jones. Jones, the . alleged driver of the car used in the drive-by shooting, was having a conversation with another inmate, George said. 'Thugs': Michael Jones (center) and Chancey Luna (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane.  James Edwards (left) is now facing accessory charge after he cooperated with police . Questionable: Friends claimed Edwards (center) and Luna (right) were trying to join the local chapter . of the notorious Crips gang, and they posted pictures to their Facebook . where they are holding gang signs . The . other inmate, according to George, asked Jones: 'Why did you have to . shoot an Australian? Why didn't you drive and shoot somebody else?' George said Jones had replied: 'We tried to shoot several other people, but we kept missing.' At . the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, Judge Jerry Herberger . ordered 18-year-old Jones and the 16-year-old alleged shooter, Chancey . Luna, to stand trial for the first-degree murder of Chris Lane. The . third murder accused, James Edwards, who was 15 on 16 August last year . when Lane was shot in the back and left to die on the side of a Duncan, . Oklahoma, street, has become a prosecution witness. Edwards . told the preliminary hearing Luna had fired the .22 revolver that . struck Lane as the Australian jogged, but only after the Ford Focus . driven by Jones swerved unexpectedly. Luna had later said he thought the . gun was loaded with blanks, Edwards said. In . another twist, Howard and Jim Berry, the two lawyers representing Luna, . were charged with contempt of court on Wednesday after talking to . reporters about the case last month. Victim: Chris Lane (left) was shot when he was jogging during a visit to his girlfriend Sarah Harper's (right) family home in Duncan, Oklahoma . Remembered: Bob Gregg, a professor in the religion department at Oklahoma Christian University, bows his head as he leads the audience in prayer during the memorial service for Lane after he was shot . Shock: Residents of Duncan have been moved by the murder that attracted worldwide attention . A . gag order has been placed on the lawyers and prosecutors involved in . the case. The Berrys, who are cousins, entered not guilty pleas. Shortly . after the shooting, police said Jones told investigators that the three . were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it'. It was later suspected that Lane's murder was race related. One . of Edwards' friends, Serenity Jackson, told The Associated Press she . didn't believe race was a factor in the shooting. She noted that Luna's . mother, Edwards' girlfriend and Jones are white. 'It has nothing to do with Chris being white. They didn't even know who he was,' said Jackson, 17, who grew up with Edwards. It had previously emerged that Edwards . had posted on his Twitter profile that he 'hated white people' and . boasted that . he beat up five white people - using the derogatory term 'woods' - . after the George Zimmerman acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case. 'Ayeee I knocced out 5 woods since Zimmerman court!:) lol sh*t ima keep sleepin sh*t! #ayeeee,' he wrote. In another, he said: '90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM'. But Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that . rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, . authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the . thuggish beliefs of their idols, with rapper Chief Keef being prime suspect. Tough guy: Edwards posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening in a blue bandana associated with the notorious Crips gang . It emerged that the day before . Edwards is alleged to have shot dead Christopher in a drive-by from . a black Ford Focus, he tweeted about rapper Chief Keef. Two . days earlier he posted a chilling tweet that was a lyric from the . rapper's song I Don't Like. It read: 'With my n****s when it's time to . start taken life's' (sic). Other lyrics in the same song include 'pistol . toting and I'm shooting on sight'. Ford said: 'These boys were more into . some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang . stuff. One of the parents said something about rap. 'These . boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't . matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and . they said, ""there's the target"" and they followed him and shot him. He . could have been anybody walking down the street.' The small town has been rocked by the . senseless murder that has sent shockwaves around the world, leaving many . wondering what drove the 'bored' boys to apparently kill just for the . thrill of it. Because . of Lane's nationality, the case has gained national attention, but some . have criticized the White House for not reacting strongly enough. A . State Department spokeswoman put out a statement last year saying that . the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did . not comment on any specific action. Australia's . former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called for his fellow . countrymen to think of this shooting when they are planning a trip to . the United States.","Oklahoma Judge Joe Enos on Thursday set a trial date of August 18 for Michael Dewayne Jones, 18, and Chancey Allen Luna, 16 .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The little-known story of a daring British teenager who risked her life to be a spy in Nazi-occupied France during the Second World War has come to light. Plucky Sonya Butt - known as Agent Blanche – was just 19 when she was parachuted into northern France to act as a go-between for Allied troops and the French Resistance ahead of D-Day. During her time with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) she met and married Guy D’Artois, a fellow spy, and the pair went on to wreak havoc on the Germans. The spy in retirement: Sonya Butt was just 19 when she was dropped into German-occupied France and began spying for the Allies against the Axis powers. Here she is enjoying her life in Canada . Sonya used her beauty to woo German soldiers for information while secretly recruiting new Resistance cells and training them in guerrilla warfare. Despite her youth, Sonya was a specialist in explosives and her expertise was much in demand in rural towns and villages in the beaten country. The intrepid youngster earned a reputation for fearlessness often sabotaging bridges and ambushing German convoys. The spy who loved me: Sonya was parachuted into German-occupied Europe (left) and with her husband Guy D'Artois, GM, DSO . Meanwhile, her husband was performing his own daring exploits several hundred miles away where he led a 600-strong army of French Resistance fighters. The combat unit disrupted the German army by destroying strategic bridges and railway lines and attacking enemy positions. Now 89 and living in Canada, Sonya, a widow, is the only female British spy from the Second World War still alive. Allo allo: The job of a wireless operator was hazardous and physically exhausting; Sonya relaxes at the Palace of Versailles . Her remarkable story has only fully emerged in a new book called The Women Who Spied for Britain. Sonya was born in Eastchurch, Kent, on May 14, 1924 but spent most of her childhood in France where she learned to speak the language. Robyn Walker, a school teacher and historian from Ontario, Canada, said: ‘The story of Sonya Butt is relatively unknown but quite amazing. ‘She was well trained in sabotage and she lived for that - she found it very exciting. ‘She liked to be part of the teams sent out to railroads and she would be right there with a gun in hand, just like the men. ‘She was up for just about anything. ‘Sonya’s incredible story is one that should never be forgotten. She was among a small number of daring women who risked their lives on the front line for the war effort. ‘What she and the others did was truly amazing. ‘I really think that celebrating our heroes or heroines is somewhat of a moral obligation that we have to the people who put their lives on the line for us. ‘To allow the sacrifices these women made to be forgotten would be to do them a grave disservice.’ When war broke out in September 1939 she returned to Britain and in 1941, aged 17, joined the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force in the hope of seeing action. However, to her bitter disappointment, that same year women were banned from frontline duties and she was reduced to filing paperwork. Desperate for adventure, in 1943 Sonia was recruited to the SOE, a top secret organisation set up to infiltrate occupied Europe with a network of spies. Around 13,000 people worked for the SOE, including 3,200 women. During her training she met and fell in love with Canadian recruit Guy and the pair married in Scotland prior to being dropped into France on May 28, 1944, nine days before D-Day. Her mission got off to a bumpy start when a container carrying her wardrobe was intercepted by a German patrol, alerting the Nazis to the presence of a new female agent. But Sonya refused to lie low and began work immediately, training the Resistance how to make explosives. She used her beauty to get close to the German soldiers but it almost blew her cover when one evening while in a café with an officer she dropped her bag carrying her revolver. The bag landed with a clunk revealing she was carrying a gun, but she talked the officer round by showing him a forged firearms certificate signed by the Gestapo. The only way to fly: Consolidated B24 Liberator used by the RAF . A history of the women who worked in espionage for Britain during the Second World War . She had another close run-in in June 1944 when she was arrested by German soldiers and questioned. But she managed to talk her way out of the situation thanks to a precisely-planned cover story and false papers. Following the liberation of Paris in August 1944, when she was reunited with her husband, Sonia turned down the offer to go home. Instead she teamed up with the Americans and provided vital intelligence that exposed German positions. She was then captured by French troops who had seen her cavorting with German soldiers and threatened to shave her head, a punishment meted out to collaborators. But luckily the incident was spotted by Resistance members who explained who she was and she was freed. Following the war Sonya and Guy returned to his native Canada, setting up home near Montreal where they raised six children. She became a housewife, supporting her family while Guy remained in the army. Sonya was made an MBE in recognition of her services and was also mentioned in dispatches. Guy was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the Croix de Guerre and the George medal. He died in Canada in 1999 aged 81. British Second World War agent Violette Szabo . There were a number of female spies who operated in German-occupied Europe during the Second World War. The most famous probably was Violette Szabo, GC, the daughter of an English father and French mother born in Paris in 1921 as Violette Bushell. She worked in Woolworths in Oxford Street. In 1940 she joined the Land Army before working in an armaments factory in west London, the year she married French soldier Étienne Szabo. He was killed in action in North Africa in 1942. Violette joined the SOE and took part in two missions in France. On the second, she was captured by the Germans, interrogated and tortured. She was executed at Ravensbrück concentration camp in February 1945. She was 23. Szabo was the second woman to be awarded the George Cross, bestowed posthumously on December 17, 1946. Her story was told in the film Carve Her Name with Pride, starring Virginia Mckenna. Odette Hallowes GC, MBE was born Brailly in Amiens, France. When she was seven she contracted polio and spent a year blind and another unable to move her limbs. Responding to a request for photographs of the Continent, she joined the Special Forces of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and was trained by the SOE. In 1942, she went to France and worked with Peter Churchill, her handler. On April 16, 1943, she and Churchill were betrayed and arrested. She was tortured with a red-hot poker but stuck to her cover story that he was Winston’s nephew and she was taking money to him. She was condemned to death in June 1943 and sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp. She survived the war, divorced her husband and married Churchill. She remains the only woman to have received the George Cross whilst alive, all other female GC awards to date being posthumous.","Sonya Butt aka Agent Blanche parachuted into France when she was 19 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jailed: Beverly Ann Greenagel, from Eagan, Minnesota, was sentenced to 45 days in prison after three-month-old Dane Abledinger was found lifeless after being put down for a nap in August 2011 . A 64-year-old day-care provider has been jailed over the death of an infant who suffocated in his sleep while under her supervision. Beverly Ann Greenagel, from Eagan, Minnesota, was sentenced to 45 days in prison after three-month-old Dane Ableidinger was found lifeless after being put down for a nap in August 2011. 'If you had done what you were supposed to do, we wouldn’t be here,' Dakota County District Judge Michael Mayer told her. 'You need to understand: Dane died because of your actions.' The court earlier heard how she had put him under a blanket on the floor - in direct contravention of both his parents wishes and the safe-sleep standards of her childcare license - while looking after 21 children at her home. Under state rules, she should have been looking after no more than 15 children at one time, reported the Minnesota Star-Tribune. A coroner later recorded the youngster's death as a result of positional asphyxia. He had been lying on his front under a blanket. She also also reportedly tried to cover up her mistakes by folding away the bloodied blanket on which the baby died, and telling her 12-year-old helper to tell investigators that Ablei­dinger had been sleeping on his back and in a crib. 'Every choice Bev made was a selfish one,' said the baby’s father, Mac Ableidinger, during the hearing, 'thinking only of protecting herself.' She was initially charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter, child neglect and endangerment, and interfering with a body. Even after pleading guilty to second-degree manslaughter, however, Greenagel denied she was responsible for the child's death during a pre-sentence hearing, which not only delayed her sentencing but prompted the prosecution to increase the amount of jail time from 30 to 45 days in the plea agreement. 'It has been 945 days since my heart has felt whole,' said Stephanie Ableidinger, who suffered seizures and panic attacks after her son’s death. Short life: Dane Ableidinge was only three-and-a-half months old when he died; his autopsy revealed that he suffocated to death . Work from home: Greenagel ran her service, Bev's Day Care, from her home in Eagan, Minnesota . On the fateful day of August 8 2011, Greenagel, who at the time was watching six more children than legally allowed, did not check on the boy for an hour after putting him face-down for a nap, the court heard. She was holding an annual water balloon fight with her older children and later told police she  moved him downstairs so he wouldn't get trampled. Dane had apparently suffocated and was found where she left him on the flannel blanket. According to the Minnesota Star-Tribune, Greenagel worked out of her home and ran Bev’s Day Care. The paper reported that Greenagel laid Dane down to sleep on his stomach in one of the bedrooms in her house, perhaps because a child who had just awoken from a nap had soiled its crib. A frantic 12-year-old girl who called 911 after Dane was discovered was recorded as saying: ‘Oh, um. There’s a baby dead.’ Loving parents: Mac and Stephanie Ableidinger asked for donations in lieu of flowers in memory of their young son . Records from the state showed that Greenagel allegedly tried to cover her tracks by taking the blanket Dane had slept on and stacking it with other blankets. Dane had left blood spots on it. When police searched the house after obtaining a warrant, they found the blood stains and confirmed that they belonged to the infant. According to the Inver Grove Heights Patch, Greenagel gave several varying accounts of the story to authorities. Greenagel had cared for the girl and was enlisting her help to care for the child. The Star-Tribune notes that caretakers must be at least 13. Dakota County Attorney told the Star-Tribune: ‘It’s always disturbing to see children die under any circumstance, and it appears that proper monitoring and care could have avoided this tragedy.’ In Minnesota, 82 children have died in licenced day-care facilities in the past ten years. Court documents show the caretaker was cited once in 1984 and again in 1994 for violating the terms of her licence. On April 6, 1984, Greenagel was found to have too many infants and toddlers in her care. Three months later, a parent complained that the caregiver was often absent, and instead hired a 16-year-old girl to look after the children. The parent alleged that Greenagel would often leave to go shopping, play racquetball, and go shopping while the girl was left to care for the infants and toddlers. The parent added that ‘Bev’s’ home was a good place for their children, but they were upset she was not around. A decade later, an unannounced licensor visit proved that she still had more children in her care than her license allowed.","Beverly Ann Greenagel jailed for 2-degree manslaughter of Dane Ableidinger .

Putnam County Sheriff David Andrews said 23-year-old Courtney Cash's body was discovered Wednesday morning in a home near Cookeville, about 70 miles east of Nashville. Cash's body was found in a chest just inside the front door, Andrews said.

Andrews said the couple had gone out with a friend before an altercation took place in the house on rice Road where Johnson and Cash lived with their 20-month-old daughter. The friend, identified as Wayne Gary Masciarella, 26, has been charged with first-degree murder. Despite being stabbed multiple times, Johnson was able to get out of the house with his daughter and drive himself to the hospital, Andrews said. The scene inside the house was 'somewhat bloody,' Andrews told reporters at a news conference. 'There was a struggle,' the sheriff added. According to an arrest warrant for Masciarella obtained by Herald-Citizen, investigators claim he stabbed Miss Cash with a kitchen knife at around 10.40am and then hid her body in a chest in a bid to cover up the crime. The box was described as coffee-table size case measuring 4 feet by 1.5 feet and 2 feet deep, according to NewsChannel5. What happened: Investigators believe the couple (right) were hanging out with their friend Masciarella (left) when the three of them had a falling out possibly related to drugs .

A holiday company in Wiltshire will be a little more cautious about renting out one of their narrowboats to stag parties after this weekend. A vessel hired by a group of men from Wales capsized on Saturday as the party tried to navigate the Kennet and Avon Canal near Widcombe. Stranded: The boat was photographed at a 30 degree angle with one end submerged under water . The Yellow Weaver was negotiating Lock 11 at around 2pm when the incident happened. The water in the lock drained away but the boat was stuck on the sill and it rolled over. Luckily all of the men on board managed to escape uninjured. The group had rented the boat from Alvechurch Waterway Holidays at Hilperton Marina in Trowbridge, Wiltshire. Capsized: The Canal and River Trust posted a photograph on Twitter of the boat, which had been hired from holiday company Alvechurch Waterway Holidays . Passer-by Paul Clements watched the drama unfold. He said: ‘It hooked its stern on the gate ledge and tilted forward as the water was let out of the lock. The guy panicked and jumped off as it rolled over.’ The Canal and River Trust posted a photograph on Twitter showing the boat at a 30 degree angle with one end submerged under water. The Trust said the narrowboat would be lifted out of the canal by crane tomorrow at the earliest. No-one can get in and out of Bath through this stretch of canal - 650 yards (600 metres) between Bath Bottom Lock to Bath Top Lock - until it is cleared. Blocked: The narrowboat will be lifted out of the canal by crane tomorrow at the earliest . A spokesman for the Trust said that the firm had launched an investigation. He said: ‘Unfortunately it was one of ours but thankfully nobody was hurt. We don't want to say too much at the moment because we're still investigating it.’ The Kennet and Avon Canal is one of the most popular broad canals on the network, passing through pretty villages and towns, including Bradford-on-Avon, Bath and Bristol. Boat tourism contributed £626 million to the West Country economy last year and a report published in February showed boating tourism accounted for 16,339 full-time jobs in the West economy.","The Yellow Weaver capsized on the Kennet and Avon Canal on Saturday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New Jersey teen admitted on Wednesday to luring a high school boy into a relationship with a non-existent girl he created on social networking websites and trying to cash in on the ransom money after he reported to federal authorities that the non-existent girl had been kidnapped. Andriy Mykhaylivskyy - who also goes by the name Andriy Haddad - pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal authorities when he reported that the girl he created online had been kidnapped overseas. Mykhaylivskyy, 19, was arrested in August by officers from the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service and admitted to creating the online identity of Kate Brianna Fulton on social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter, and using the online persona to carry on a year-long, virtual relationship with an 18-year-old, male classmate. Catfish: Andriy Mykhaylivskyy (center) admitted that he created a fake identity of a girl and falsely claimed that she'd been kidnapped . These types of fraudulent, virtual relationships are often refereed to as 'Catfishing' after documentary filmmaker Nev Schulman documented his own online relationship with a woman who, it turned out, had lied to him about her looks and age. In July of last year, Mykhaylivskyy was visiting the Ukraine when he called the U.S. Embassy in Moldova and - using an alias - reported that his girlfriend, Kate Fulton, was kidnapped in Bulgaria, where she had gone on vacation. Mykhaylivskyy also told authorities that his bogus girlfriend's mother had received a ransom demand for $50,000. Ransom: Mykhaylivskyy reported to federal authorities that the girl he created online had been kidnapped and the kidnappers wanted $50,000 . In addition to lying to federal authorities, Mykhaylivskyy - posing as Fulton - sent electronic messages to his Catfished classmate saying that Fulton had been kidnapped. In one message Mykhaylivskyy sent the classmate via-Fulton's Twitter account, he said 'someone help me.' Worried about his online girlfriend, the classmate called the U.S. Embassy in Bulgaria to report that he'd received a message from Fulton, whom he believed to have been kidnapped. In pleading guilty, Mykhaylivskyy admitted that he knew Fulton didn't exist and she had not been kidnapped, according to NorthJersey.com. Common: Catfishing got its name from a documentary and TV show starring Nev Schulman that documents his experience with a fake, online girlfriend . Additionally, the website reports, Mykhaylivskyy admitted to contacting the classmate while he was in jail and arranging a meeting, which authorities say was obstruction of justice. Mykhaylivskyy is scheduled to be sentenced on June 25 by U.S. District Judge Claire C. Cecchi. He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.","Andriy Mykhaylivskyy admitted he created a fake online identity of a woman on social networking websites .

"By . Wills Robinson . Holidaymakers were caught up in an international drugs smuggling ring when £3m of heroin was found on board their coach. Retired Frank Cooper, who organised the trip to Belgium, had no idea the owners of the coach firm, Glen and Gary Wheatley, were using the business to import the Class A drug. When the bus was stopped and searched at Dover, the haul of 12kg high-purity heroin was found hidden in a compartment above the wheel arch. Jailed: Glen (left) and Gary Wheatley used their coach business as cover for an international drug smuggling operation. They were arrested and jailed after attempting to transport £3million worth of heroin . Around £3million worth of the drug was found when the vehicle was searched by the UK Border Agency on its way back into Britain . Mr Cooper came under suspicion himself as the organiser of the trip and was arrested on the way back from the holiday, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Gary Wheatley, 51, who had been persuaded to drive the bus for his brother, was arrested at the scene, but Glen went on the run in Holland. He was caught after robbing a parking attendant then starting a police chase when he drove down the wrong way on a motorway in Amsterdam. The court heard he was jailed in Holland for dangerous driving and extradited back to the UK last year to face the drugs charges. Now Glen, 45, has been jailed for 12-and-a-half years after admitting conspiracy to import drugs, while Gary was given six years. Recorder William Lowe told the pair: 'You both played for high stakes. This was a sophisticated operation as it involved adapting the coach which was sent on this trip that Mr Cooper, a wholly innocent man, was seeking to organise to Ostend. 'He ended up in custody and arrested as a suspect.' Border guards found the drugs concealed in the wheel arch of the coach. Retired Frank Cooper, who organised the trip, had no idea the company was hiding drugs on board . The Class A drug was hidden in a specially-designed compartment in the vehicle . The Wheatley brothers had been running G and G Travel, in Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland. Mr Cooper, a retired coach driver, was unable to use his usual coach company for a short trip to Ostend, Belgium, and so asked the Wheatleys if they could assist. Gary picked the party up in December 2011, driving from the North East to the continent and was followed by his brother Glen who drove via Manchester. While the coach was parked up in Belgium, the heroin was loaded into a specially adapted concealed compartment near the wheel arch. The haul of heroin was packed into cardboard boxes . On the way back the coach was stopped and searched by the UK Border Agency and a total of 11.90kg of high purity heroin was found in 12 parcels, with a street value of between £2m and £3m. Glen, due to travel back a couple of days later, then went on the run in Holland for eight months. In July 2012, he was trying to escape from a robbery when he drove the wrong way up a motorway in Amsterdam. He was caught and convicted of dangerous driving and got 15 months in prison. The court heard their coach business had money problems at the time but that they were unaware of the amount or types of drugs involved. The haul was discovered when the coach was searched at Dover (file pictured)","Glen and Gary Wheatley, from Houghton-le-Spring, imported class A drugs .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Football supporters don't get managers sacked on their own but they can do their bit. David Moyes should be a little nervous to learn, therefore, that a minority of those on the Stretford End have this week discussed taking down the banner that hangs there in his honour. It won’t happen, of course. It would be a self-defeating, tasteless act and United’s hard core support has more class than that. But as they funnel down Sir Matt Busby Way towards Old Trafford before their team’s Champions League tie with Olympiacos on Wednesday night, a growing number already feel that ‘The Chosen One’ has turned out to be ‘The Wrong One’.

Head boy: Moyes relives his days as a defender (right) as Shinji Kagawa and Danny Welbeck also train . Moyes bucked his own recent trend and fronted up well at his Champions League press conference yesterday, exhibiting some calm and an overdue aura of defiance. Earlier on at the training ground, he smiled as Wayne Rooney nutmegged him, even if the horseplay involving the United manager, Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand and Robin van Persie did look a little staged. 'This club will rise again,' said Moyes, striking a rather dramatic tone. Nevertheless, the mood on Manchester’s red half is dark. United supporters not old enough to remember that Sir Alex Ferguson was three years in to his tenure when supporters endeavoured to chase him out of town after a defeat to Crystal Palace in December 1989 are already convinced of Moyes’ unsuitability. For the first time in memory, journalists covering United have been criticised by supporters for being too 'soft' on the manager. Meanwhile, revelations in print on Tuesday that the United board were encouraged by Old Trafford’s apparent support of Moyes towards the end of Sunday’s humbling by Liverpool were quickly countered by many who claimed the spontaneous outbreak of singing was no more than an attempt to drown out the crowing coming from the away end.

This is a remarkable time in this great football town and as cocksure neighbours Manchester City prepare to come tearing round the corner for an Old Trafford derby next Tuesday, Moyes can only hope that an unlikely Champions League comeback gives him some unexpected breathing space tonight. 'I think the support inside Old Trafford has been phenomenal,' said Moyes on Tuesday. 'I’ve told the players we need to give something back now, we need to start performing together. Me and the team. 'We need to make sure that we work together to get a performance on the night to be remembered. 'We’ll leave nothing behind on the night hopefully and we’ll try to make sure that we somehow get ourselves through to the next round.' Asked the inevitable questions about his future, Moyes did his best to talk of the long-term, mentioning once again fundamental concepts he feels need to be changed at a club, problems previously masked by Ferguson’s individual and unique brilliance. Can it get any worse? Manchester United players trudge off after their defeat by Liverpool on Sunday . Contrast: Luis Suarez celebrates during Liverpool's win as United's season lurches from one disaster to another .

'The biggest assurance is that the club let me get on with the job.' It is a familiar Moyes theme and would deserve a more sympathetic audience if only his team’s football showed some sign of improving. Sadly, the manner of Sunday’s defeat to Liverpool has done nothing to inspire any kind of optimism as United try to overturn a 2-0 first leg deficit. United vice-captain Patrice Evra did his best to talk up his team-mates’ chances tonight but even he was left without answers when asked exactly why a team of English champions have imploded almost overnight.

'I thought I could come out here and just crack on and see it through without any issues, make sure I'm here for the guys when they need me. 'I'm frustrated and disappointed in myself, but it really does prove how physically and mentally tough these guys are,' he said of his fellow adventurers, some of whom had lost limbs or suffered other injuries during service in Afghanistan. After checking whether he had vomited from the sickness, medics ordered Harry to rest for 36 hours, which he found frustrating. ""Being tent-bound really sucks. I don't really enjoy sitting around and doing nothing, especially when I know they're walking 17km.

Eventually, on December 13, Harry and the rest of the team reached the South Pole in record-breaking time . Foul weather conditions, with temperatures plummeting as low as minus 40C (minus 40F) eventually led to the competitive race element of the challenge being abandoned, with the teams eventually arriving at the South Pole together on skis. Relieved Harry said of his team at the finish: 'I'm so happy for them. They've done so well - every single person, but especially these guys and girls. I'm honoured and privileged to be here with these guys. It's been very special.'

"By . Sam Webb . Lee Crabtree, 27, posed as a teenager and chatted to youngsters online. He was caught when a mother posed as a teen called 'Sweet as Candy' to snare him . A worried mother posed as a 13 year old schoolgirl to help catch a pervert who was grooming girls over social networking sites. Masquerading as a teenager called 'Sweet as Candy', the woman set a honey trap for wheelchair user Lee Crabtree. She arranged to meet the 27-year-old, of South Shields, at Newcastle’s Haymarket Metro Station before calling the police. Newcastle Crown Court heard yesterday how Crabtree had contacted four teenagers from across the UK, ranging from ages 11 to 13, over teenage social networking sites. Pretending to be a 19-year-old, he told one of his victims that he 'loved her' before making a number of obscene suggestions, including asking for a 'threesome' with one of her friends. Crabtree, who has suffered from Spina Bifida since he was a child, asked to meet another of his victims, claiming he would kill himself if she did not go out with him. Gavin Doig, prosecuting, said: 'The mother of the 13-year-old then went online posing as a child called Sweet as Candy. 'Crabtree contacted her and sent sexually explicit messages and arranged to meet her at the Haymarket, telling her to wear loose clothes. 'The defendant travelled to the station and waited for an hour where he was caught on CCTV. The mother contacted the police and he was then arrested at his home.' Evidence was then found on Crabtree’s phone of a fourth girl who he had contacted and had asked to 'remove all her clothes'. Andrew Finlay, defending, said the defendant had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to save his victims from having to come to court to give evidence. He added: 'He has engaged in conversation with girls who were hundreds of miles away. When he was rebuffed from arranging meetings, the girls did not hear anything more from him. The mother arranged to meet the 27-year-old at Newcastle's Haymarket Metro Station before calling the police . Crabtree had pleaded guilty to four charges of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and two of attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming. He was sentenced to 12 months in jail at Newcastle Crown Court . 'We are dealing with a grooming situation here rather than anything else.' Sentencing Crabtree to 12 months in jail, Judge John Evans said: 'Social networking sites enable those who are inclined to behave in this way to do so very easily with limited prospects of being caught. 'These girls did recognise this behaviour was wrong, so they are all to be commended for the way they approached the situation. 'The reality is that all too often girls do not have the maturity of mind to resist the pressures that can be applied to them.' Addressing Crabtree, Judge Evans added: 'This is behaviour that cannot be tolerated.' Crabtree had pleaded guilty to four charges of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and two of attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming. He was also given a 10 year Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) and ordered to sign the sex offenders register for the next ten years.

"By . Richard Spillett . Mother-of-two Naudel Turner, 42, died after she was stabbed at least four times in the neck in an attack in Tottenham, north London . A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a community nurse in Tottenham, north London. Mother-of-two Naudel Turner, 42, was repeatedly stabbed in the neck in an attack on Wednesday afternoon. Dariusz Miakienko, 46, of Lordship Lane, Tottenham appeared before Highbury Corner Magistrates today charged with the stabbing. Miakienko appeared in the dock wearing a long grey t-shirt and spoke only to confirm his name through a Belarusian interpreter. Deputy District Judge Kevin Gladwell told Miakienko: 'Because of the nature of the offence, I transfer the case to the Central Criminal Court. You will make your first appearance, in custody on Monday.' Ms Turner, described by colleagues as a 'lovely, lovely lady’, was leaving her Castle View Surgery work place on Wednesday when the attack happened. Witnesses at the scene said they saw a man standing over her body rolling up a cigarette as she lay dying on the floor. It is believed Ms Turner was heading home to the terrace house in Fulham, west London she shares with her husband William, 61, and two sons, aged 22 and 19, when the stabbing took place. Bruce Grove in Tottenham was cordoned off yesterday while a police team combed the street for potential evidence . A close friend and neighbour, who asked not to be named, said Mrs Turner ‘doted’ on the couple’s sons. They added: ‘She just loved her family to pieces. They’re upstanding members of the community. It’s a massive shock. She was such a gentle woman. She’s an angel.’ She said of Mrs Turner’s husband: ‘He is shell-shocked. It is just so raw. He’s not sleeping.’ Witnesses at the scene of the attack told of their horror after Ms Turner was approached and stabbed in broad daylight. One of Ms Turner's colleagues, Dr . Fariba Azarian, said Ms Turner's workmates had been left 'shocked and . distraught' by her death. She added: 'She was an absolutely lovely, lovely lady. One of the most professional and caring people that I have seen. Police are appealing for anyone who may have seen the attack to come forward . Witnesses at the scene of the stabbing said they were left shocked by the violence, which unfolded in broad daylight . 'She was somebody who would go out of her way to help people and patients. She was very, very kind.’ Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh, who is leading the murder investigation, said: ‘Mrs Turner was a hard-working mother of two boys. ‘I would like to directly appeal to anyone who may have captured images or footage before and after the incident to contact us immediately. 'In particular we would like to speak to a black male who was wearing a white tracksuit top who witnesses saw taking images at the scene. ‘I would appeal to him or anyone else to contact us with the footage or images they took as a matter  of urgency, and not to upload them to the internet or share them with friends as it may harm our investigation.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Triple killer Joanna Dennehy's 7ft 3in . accomplice called her his 'devil in the flesh' and said having sex with . her was a 'dream never to come true' in twisted letters from his cell. The praise for her 'bloodthirsty' leanings and 'dirty and dark mind' appears to destroy Gary Stretch's court claims that he only helped the mother-of-two's murder spree because he feared her. Dennehy, 31, received the letters in her cell while the pair were awaiting sentence - before sending them on to Stretch's ex-partner Julie Gibbons, 53. Scroll down for video . Assistance: Gary Stretch (right) drove Joanna Dennehy (left) to Hereford where she stabbed two dog walkers . On camera: A CCTV image issued by Cambridgeshire Police last month of Dennehy walking through Strensham Service station off the M5 south of Worcester on April 2 last year with Gary Stretch . With a knife: In the police custody suite, 31-year-old Dennehy joked to officers about her 'hectic week' Stretch, 48, finishes one letter: 'See . you really soon. Your biggest supporter! Love you always. Love . Undertaker xxxxxxx Hubby 4 Lifey'. In another of the five letters, revealed in the Daily Mirror, . he writes: 'So looking forward to seeing you babe, well your sexy smile . and thoughs evil eyes of yours oops evil ment to angeleyes (lmfao).' Stretch . was jailed for life for two counts of attempted murder and preventing . the burial of three people after he was convicted of helping Dennehy . murder three men in 10 days. He shouted ‘thank you very much’ after being told he would serve a minimum of 19 years. Dennehy was handed a whole-life prison term last month, only the third ever given to a woman. Miss . Gibbons - who was sent the love notes by Dennehy accompanied by a . letter in which the killer said 'an apology would be pointless' - said . they undermine Stretch's claims that he acted out of fear. Throughout . the trial Stretch's lawyers said his huge size could not stop him being . afraid of Dennehy and what she might do to him. you can always count on me no matter wat my devil in the flesh, I just wish Id got the chance to really show u how much I loved you. I am sad I never got the chance to make love to you babe, I one of those men that didn't just want to **** you, since day one, making love to you was my dream and now it will always be a dream never to come true. hey I might get out one day and get some sort of **** dont you think? you are the one woman I ever truely loved, hope you do good things for the future babe, do you thing you ever be a free woman again. My legal team think I will get a straight sentence of around 12-18 years. Ok angel I off for now, hope to hear from you really soon, . always yours . Hugs and Kisses from me to you . Love you .

BABYBOY . ...will never meet another like me babe, that I know for sure, well wat more can I say babe ok will try and write you some more tomorrow ok babe which will another letter babe. always yours . I love you Joanne . your personal Undertaker . Love . THE DRIVE . Weapon: A knife used by Dennehy, of Peterborough, to murder three people and stab another two people . But . Stretch was convicted after a trial in which jurors saw CCTV images of . him walking hand-in-hand with Dennehy through a motorway service . station. Dennehy's letter to Stretch's ex-partner, revealed yesteday, read: ‘Mrs Stretch, I have received your letter. ‘I would like to set a matter to rest. Gary did not go along with me out of fear for you.' 'Mine . and Gary’s relationship was not based on past background. I had no idea . you even existed until in court my legal team informed me of a recorded . phone call to you. ‘Not . long after meeting Gary I made it clear I was not the sort of person . one should pursue, he chose otherwise. The Gary I know, love and respect . seems to differ from yours. 'I love Gaz and contrary to what he tells you he has strong feelings for me' ‘I told him a million times to get away from me and the situation but he flat out refused and got annoyed with me when I did. ‘I . had reasons for my actions and your view of me is understandable, but . wrong. I tried my hardest to prove I’d manipulated him, but if you know . him as well as you say you do you will know Gary has his own mind. During the trial, prosecutors said . Dennehy 'cast a spell' over her alleged accomplices and some of her . victims as she killed 'for fun'. Deaths: John Chapman (left) and Kevin Lee (right) were both killed in Peterborough by Dennehy last March . Stabbed: Dennehy 'exploded' into violence last March, first killing friend Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, after luring him to a house by text . Scene: The house (right) in Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, where Joanna Dennehy killed John Chapman . She . was likened to 'Uma Thurman from Kill Bill and the woman from the . Terminator' by married father-of-two Mr Lee shortly before his death. At . the height of a nationwide man-hunt, she bragged to one witness that . she had killed eight people - although no further murders have been . detected. Dennehy pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, two of attempted murder and three of preventing the lawful and decent burials of her three victims. Two other accomplices were also jailed. Robert Moore, 56, was jailed for three years after he admitted sheltering Dennehy and Leslie Layton, 36, was jailed for 14 years for preventing the burials of her victims. The bodies of Dennehy's victims - Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee and John Chapman - were found in March and April last year. After . the killings, Dennehy and Stretch drove to Hereford where she selected . two other men - Robin Bereza and John Rogers - at random. She repeatedly stabbed the dog walkers in the street but both survived. All of the murder victims died from multiple stab injuries, including wounds to the heart. After his death at a house in Peterborough, on or around March 19, the body of Mr Slaboszewski, 31, was stored in a wheelie bin. At one point a smirking Dennehy showed the body to a teenage girl, prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the trial. LUKASZ SLABOSZEWSKI . The 31-year-old moved to the UK from Nowa Sol, Poland, in 2005 to work in a DHL warehouse in Peterborough. Cambridge . Crown Court heard that, at the time of his death, he was being . prescribed methadone as a substitute for his heroin addiction. He . was last seen alive leaving his home in the city’s Lincoln Road on . March 19 last year having met Joanna Dennehy for the first time the . previous day. He told friends he had found an 'English girlfriend'. It is thought he was stabbed to death in a property in Rolleston Garth on or soon after this date. Afterwards, . Dennehy stored his body in a wheelie bin for several days before . dumping it in a ditch at Thorney Dyke along with that of John Chapman. Their bodies were discovered by a farmer on April 3. In . a statement issued after his death by Mr Slaboszewski’s sister, Magda . Skrzypczak, said: 'Lukasz was the joker in the family, always finding . something to laugh about. His mum and dad are devastated by their loss and he also leaves two grieving sisters.' JOHN CHAPMAN . The 56-year-old, originally from Leeds, had served with the Navy in the Falkland’s war. Jurors heard he had fallen on hard times. He was an alcoholic but known as a 'friendly drunk', the court heard. Mr Chapman lived in the same set of bedsits as Dennehy in Bifield, Orton Goldhay. He . described Dennehy, who had been employed as an 'enforcer' by landlord . Kevin Lee, as the 'man woman' and friends were concerned for his safety . as she attempted to force him to move out, the court heard. He . was killed in his bedsit on March 29 after Dennehy stabbed him in the . heart. A photograph of his body, timed at 7.32am that day, was found on . Leslie Layton’s phone. Mr Chapman’s body was found alongside that of Mr Slaboszewski on April 3. At the time, his family released a statement saying: 'We are all so upset and shocked by the tragic loss of John. 'He . was a loving brother, brother in law and uncle. He was much loved by . all who knew him and will be missed by all his friends and family.' KEVIN LEE . The 48-year-old lived in Fletton, Peterborough, with his wife Christina and their two children. He ran the Quick Let property firm, which specialised in providing bedsits to people of 'limited resources', prosecutors said. Business . partner Paul Creed told the court Dennehy had approached them seeking . accommodation. Mr Creed had been reluctant to house her but Mr Lee . wanted to 'give her a chance'. Mr . Lee later employed Dennehy as a decorator and enforcer, the court . heard. On March 20, Mr Lee confessed to his wife that he was having an . affair with Dennehy. Nine . days later, on Good Friday, he gave Dennehy an Easter card. Later that . day she called him on the phone and arranged to meet him at Rolleston . Garth - where Mr Slaboszewski had been killed - before stabbing him to . death. Mr Lee’s body was found by a dog walker in a ditch beside Middle Road, Newborough, on March 30. His . family issued a statement saying: 'We are devastated by Kevin’s death, . he was a wonderful husband, father, loving brother and son. 'His naturally infectious personality touched everyone who knew him. He will be hugely missed by all his friends and family.'","Gary Stretch, 48, said having sex with her was a 'dream never to come true'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sasha Obama has arrived in China with an unusual accessory: a thumb brace. The 12-year-old was seen wearing a brace on her right hand that only covered her thumb when she de-planed in Beijing on Thursday. Calls to the White House about the cause of her injury were not immediately returned, but given the Obama girls' love of sports, an athletic accident could be a likely explanation. Scroll down for video . Making their entrance: Michelle Obama, Sasha (front right), Marian Robinson (back left) and Malia (back right) arrived in Beijing on Tuesday . Sasha, 12, is clearly wearing a brace of some kind on her right thumb but the White House has not yet commented on the cause . Sasha plays basketball at Sidwell Friends School- a fact that was revealed because President Obama often coaches as a parent volunteer. Mrs Obama has previously stated that both Sasha and Malia must play at least two sports in a year, including one team sport. Earlier reports stated that Sasha also enjoyed taking classes in gymnastics, tap dancing and tennis when they lived in Chicago before moving to Washington. The girls have joined their mother and grandmother Marian Robinson on a trip to China during their spring break from Sidwell Friends School. They landed in Beijing on Tuesday and will be traveling to two more cities- Xi'an and Chengdu- over the course of the next week. Growing girls: Sasha, who was 7-years-old when her father arrived in office, has clearly kept with the family genes as she has grown dramatically taller in recent months . Red stair looks: Both Sasha and Malia opted for high-waisted skating-style skirts, though older sister Malia, 15, chose to go the more glam route by selecting a silver pleated version as compared to Sasha's red velvet skirt . Despite her injury Sasha was clearly in a great mood as she arrived in China . Though they are off from school, that doesn't mean that Malia and Sasha will skimping on their work as Mrs Obama previously said that she and her husband make the girls write reports about the trips they take. Mrs Obama's chief of staff Tina Tchen, who is a first-generation Chinese-American, told The New York Times that the family trip featuring three-generations of the Robinson family will be appreciated by the Chinese because of the importance they place on tradition. This is both Mrs Obama and the girls' first trip in China- and Mrs Obama's third international trip without her husband since becoming First Lady. They were welcomed by the Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan. Recent run-in: Sasha was not wearing a brace when she was last pictured as they returned to the White House after the family's Christmas vacation in Hawaii . Fashion aficionados have always keyed into Mrs Obama's sartorial choices but as the girls have grown up- both in age and in height- they have become trendsetters in their own right. Malia, 15, and Sasha wore similar high waisted skating-style skirts as they deplaned Tuesday, with Sasha opting for a red velvet version while Malia chose the glitzy route with a silver pleated option. 'I'm just so proud of how they have managed all this with poise and grace and maturity,' Mrs Obama said in an interview with ABC's Robin Roberts earlier this month.","Sasha Obama, 12, wore a thumb brace as she got off the plane Thursday .

"By . Sam Creighton . A neglected dog has been put down by a vet who described it as suffering with the worst case of starvation he had ever seen. Fly, a 15-year-old lurcher, lost half her body weight, down to only 8.1kg, and shocked vets with her horrendous condition. The dog's owner, David Lowe, 33, was summoned to appear at Bolton Magistrates' Court, to face charges of animal cruelty, on February 24, but failed to turn up. However, the case was proved in his absence and he was convicted of five counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal in October 2013. His sentencing, held yesterday, has been postponed while further reports are put together for the court. Warning: Graphic content . Vets and RSPCA workers described Fly as suffering with the worst case of starvation they had ever seen . Fly, left, was so starved vets had to put her down. Her owner, David Lowe, has been described as 'vulnerable' The dog was discovered by the RSPCA at Lowe's Farnworth home in October 2013 after a tip-off from a concerned member of the public. When Fly was found, she was suffering from an abscess in its mouth, overgrown nails, a severe dental disease and had discharge oozing from a sinus beneath its eye. Vets later found that Fly also had a mammary tumour and was diabetic. The RSPCA took custody of Fly that same day but, after examination, vets decided the most humane course of action was to put the dog down. RSPCA inspector Vicki McDonald said: 'Fly was the thinnest dog I or the vet had ever seen. 'She was in such a terrible state, with so many issues, that the vet took the difficult decision to put her to sleep there and then. Of course we would have loved her to have recovered, but this was the kindest thing to do. 'At 15 years old she was an elderly dog but she was not in this condition because of her age, she was in this condition because she had been badly neglected.' The court heard how Lowe had been given £20 to take the dog to the vets for treatment but failed to do so, fearing she would be put down. The dog could have been 'easily . treated' if help had been sought earlier, the court heard, but she was . put down after being found in a 'severely emaciated condition'. Fly could have been 'easily treated' if taken to a vet sooner but had deteriorated so much nothing could be done . Fly had been starved down to weighing only 8.1kg, half of what a healthy 15-year-old lurcher should weigh . When the RSPCA found Fly in October 2013, she was suffering from a number of problems, including an abscess in her mouth, overgrown nails, dental disease, a sinus beneath her eye, left, diabetes and a tumour . Tony . Stock, prosecuting, said: 'Angus McKenzie, a vet with more than 30 . years’ experience, said this was one of the most severely emaciated dogs . - dead or alive - he had seen in 30 years. 'The . dog weighed 8.1kg - less than half its ideal weight - and scored zero . in a body condition scale where one is emaciated and five is grossly . obese.' Adam Whittaker, defending, said Lowe . had been homeless for four years and his ex-partner was caring for the . dog until returning it to him last year. Lowe was, who Mr Whittaker described as 'highly vulnerable', was said to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder following an explosion in Raikes Lane, Burnden. Magistrates decided to adjourn sentencing until April 16 to allow a report to be prepared.","Fly, 15-year-old lurcher, had lost half of body weight due to starvation .

The viral clip generated hundreds of copycat videos, with many trying to recreate the scene with their own siblings and friends. Nolan's 'Bitman Begins' clip, which aired in the US two days ago, has already got almost 700,000 views. The spoof video starts with Chris Hemsworth sitting in an armchair, still devastated over the imagined incident from 30 years ago. 'He was my brother...and we were inseparable,' he said, before comparing the two to Biblical characters Cain and Abel. 'His teeth were like razors.' A British accented Meryl Streep, playing Hemsworth's mother, pleads for Chris to 'let it go'. But Chris retorts: 'I will find him...and I will destroy him.' A hooded Tom Hanks holding a flaming torch is then shown warning Liam that Chris is 'coming for him' while dramatic music plays. Sibling rivalry: The Hemsworth brothers appear on camera for the first time in this fight scene in the hilarious spoof of YouTube video Charlie Bit My Finger . Brotherly love: The spoof video ends with the Hemsworth brothers lying in a pool of blood after they fall from a city rooftop . The original: The clip Charlie Bit My Finger has been watched more than 670 million times on YouTube, and started hundreds of copycat videos . The music escalates and the video then cuts to the brothers chasing each other on top of a city rooftop. When they come to a stop, Liam pleads that 'he was only a child' when the incident occurred - but Chris angrily replies that his younger brother was 'an animal', before holding up his mutilated left hand. After lunging at each other the pair then end up on the ground below in a pool of blood - with Chris delivering a hilarious line that people who have watched the original clip will understand before the credits roll.

"By . Ian Drury . and Stephen Wright . Investigators were paid as much as £1,000 a day to probe unfounded allegations that British troops murdered Iraqi prisoners in cold blood, the Mail can reveal. Former murder squad detectives enjoyed business class flights and stayed in five-star hotels in the  Middle East after being hired by the Al Sweady Inquiry. Extraordinary details of how the biggest probe into military abuse racked up a bill now put at £27million emerged after human rights lawyers dramatically dropped sickening slurs that captives were executed in UK custody. Rug pulled: Relatives of the captives supposedly killed by British soldiers actually died in a battle near Basra, their relatives admitted . Relatives admitted on Thursday – the last day of evidence to the inquiry – that the insurgents were killed during a fierce firefight, called the Battle of Danny Boy, near Basra in May 2004. It effectively pulled the rug from under the hearings, set up to investigate claims that soldiers killed, mutilated and tortured Iraqi prisoners. Government insiders said the twist meant ministers would be ‘reticent’ to set up public inquiries into abuse claims in the future. Critics said the last-gasp U-turn severely undermined other human rights cases brought by the families’ legal team Public Interest Lawyers, a firm founded by socialist lawyer Phil Shiner. His legal battle with the Ministry of Defence was directly responsible for then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth setting up the inquiry in 2009. It is examining allegations that UK troops unlawfully killed more than 20 prisoners and mistreated nine others after a battle near the Danny Boy base. The inquiry is named after Hameed Al Sweady, 19, one of those who died. Probe: Allegations that soldiers had executed Iraqi captives were unfounded. The above photograph, shown during the inquiry, shows a soldier guardian prisoners . Five other men also claimed they were mistreated. The claims have been strenuously denied by the Ministry of Defence which says the victims were insurgents killed in battle. Soldiers from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were heavily outnumbered in the ambush but fought back heroically. The Mail can today reveal that to investigate Mr Shiner’s clients’ claims, a team of 12 former Scotland Yard murder squad officers, commanded by a retired chief superintendent, was recruited. Their role was research and evidence gathering, including taking statements from Iraqi witnesses and British soldiers. The senior policeman is understood to have been paid more than £1,000 a day plus expenses. Junior investigators on the inquiry team were paid  £400 a day. Along with three lawyers from Public Interest Lawyers, the investigators made four visits to Beirut to interview witnesses. Each trip lasted two to three weeks, officials said. They flew business class and the group stayed at the five-star Gefinor Rotana Hotel, which is described on its website as being of ‘spellbinding luxury’. Suites were hired to interview Iraqi witnesses, who stayed at a more modest hotel in the city but were permitted to dine at the Gefinor Rotana. They were also given a ‘generous’ daily living allowance. Investigation: The hearing sat for a total of 167 days . The inquiry team later made three business class trips to Istanbul, where they stayed in the five-star Grand Hyatt Hotel, as they interviewed Iraqi witnesses. The Iraqis again stayed in a less expensive hotel but were allowed to dine in the inquiry team’s hotel and enjoy a daily living allowance. Investigative and ‘other expert services’ accounted for £7million. Running costs including IT and accommodation cost £5.9million, counsel and legal services a further £4.9million, core participant and witness costs £2.5million and general staffing £1.8million. This led to the total bill for the inquiry topping £22million at the end of February. But sources have told the Mail that the actual total is closer to £27million – six times the bill of the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen Lawrence’s murder. The vast sums spent on the inquiry were criticised. Iraq veteran Colonel Tim Collins said: ‘It is a money-making scam. The only losers are justice and the taxpayer.’ A spokesman for the inquiry, headed by retired High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes, said was ‘focused on obtaining value for money’ and its expenditure was in line with Government guidance. So far, the hearing has sat for 167 days and heard evidence from 281 witnesses. Public Interest Lawyers say there are still ‘numerous’ claims of abuse for the inquiry to consider. By STEVE BIRD . Made millions: Phil Shiner set up Public Interest Lawyers in 1999 and has fought many battles for celebrated causes of the Left . The Left-wing lawyer Phil Shiner says he’s equipped with an ‘acute sense’ that allows him to weed out suspect legal claims. The Birmingham-based solicitor, who revels in taking on Legal Aid clients suing British institutions, even once boasted that he has not ‘accepted a single case that turned out to be a try-on’. After the spectacular collapse of his firm’s attempt to prove   British troops tortured and executed Iraqis in cold blood, he will no doubt still argue that the claim was entirely legitimate. To understand what motivates Mr Shiner and his company, consider his view on Britain as a whole. ‘At the heart of the British nation is still that horrible, exploitative, violent, colonial past. We’ve never got rid of it,’ he has said, and the former grammar school boy states on his firm’s website that he is a ‘committed socialist’. Philip Joseph Shiner was born in a semi-detached home in Coventry on Christmas Day 1956. He was the second of four children of Peter Shiner, a draughtsman, and his wife, Patricia, a teacher. The family was middle class and Conservative-voting, and Philip was raised a Roman Catholic. He was known as a hard-working pupil at school and went on to study law at Birmingham University where he became increasingly active in Left-wing politics. He started work for a firm dealing with insurance claims but found it dull. He joined a practice focusing on environmental law. For a time, he worked for the Birkenhead Labour MP Frank Field. But in 1999, shortly before the Human Rights Act came into force, he set up PIL in Birmingham. His timing was superb. He has fought many battles for the Left’s celebrated causes, including acting for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He forged strong links with Matrix Chambers, the legal home of Cherie Booth QC, the wife of Tony Blair. In 2004, he was awarded Human Rights Lawyer of the Year by Liberty. While Mr Shiner, 57, insists he lives a relatively frugal lifestyle, his company has made millions from taking on British institutions, particularly the Army. It is currently acting for more than 100 clients who claim their relatives were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq. PIL has secured more than £3million in payouts. Most notably, he represented the family of Baha Mousa, the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in custody in Iraq. The subsequent inquiry cost the UK £13million. In 2007 he was accused of endangering the lives of British troops after releasing graphic photographs of the badly beaten body of Mr Mousa. Because of his work, Mr Shiner has received death threats. He blamed the Ministry of Defence for whipping up a hate campaign against him. The MoD denied doing any such thing. Five years ago, he even issued a statement saying ‘if anything happens to me, my family or my staff, it [the MoD] will be held responsible’. Mr Shiner, who has been married twice and has five children, claims Catholicism remains an essential part of his life and most years he attends a religious retreat on Iona. His competitive nature is evident in his pastimes; he cycles and runs. He also says he is a fan of absurdist humour. Presumably he’s not laughing today.","Al Sweady Inquiry was launched to investigate sickening allegations .

"By . Hugo Duncan . The Bank of England nearly doubled its spending on wine and champagne last year as it splashed out on leaving parties for senior officials including former governor Mervyn King. It spent £7,990 on 756 bottles in 2013 – a rise of 94 per cent from 2012 when it bought 444 bottles for £4,126. Leaving parties were laid on for deputy governor Paul Tucker, finance director Warwick Jones and HR boss Catherine Brown. Toast: The Bank of England spent £7,990 on 756 bottles of champagne in 2013 - a rise of 94 per cent from 2012 . The increased spending on wine and champagne will raise eyebrows as it came when the economy was only just pulling out of recession and the recovery was still fragile. The Bank by reputation used to have the second best wine cellar in the City of London behind the Stock Exchange. It spent more than £26,000 on leaving gifts and parties to mark the retirement of Lord King who was succeeded by Canadian Mark Carney in July last year after 10 years as governor. That is in line with the salary of the average worker in the UK. Champagne for the King: Leaving parties for high-ranking officials such as Mervyn King saw the bubble bill rise . Lord King was showered with gifts worth £13,102 and treated to three farewell events - a drinks reception and two dinners - costing another £13,423. He received a copy of a £10,000 painting of himself as well as a £2,505 bust of German politician and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and a £597 silver napkin ring. The original painting hangs at the Bank alongside portraits of the men who have held the position since the first governor in 1694. There has never been a female governor and Nemat Shafik was this week named as only the second woman in the Bank’s 320 history to be deputy governor. Lord King earned a £300,000 salary and enjoys a pension from the Bank believed to be worth more than £200,000 a year. Mr Tucker, who was seen as a frontrunner to succeed Lord King but was beaten to the post by Mr Carney, was given two leaving parties at a total cost of £9,164.75. Mr Tucker, who was deputy governor for financial stability, was caught up in the Libor rate-rigging scandal and departed the Bank shortly after the arrival of Mr Carney. The Bank, which is owned by the Treasury, is not directly funded by taxpayers, instead raising cash from a variety of sources including the financial sector. The main source is known as the ‘cash ratio deposit’, under which lenders deposit cash interest-free. The Bank then ploughs this into investments that pay interest, and keeps the difference for itself. A spokesman for the central bank said: ‘The Bank of England, as the nation’s central bank, hosts a number of business-related receptions each year. These provide important opportunities for the Bank to interact with a wide range of economic, financial, academic and international audiences, and form part of our obligations as an active member of the international central banking community. ‘The Bank provides refreshments at such events, and this involves purchasing food and beverages, including wine, for current and future use, taking advantage of bulk cost savings where possible. 'In 2013, the Bank hosted several leaving events in addition to business receptions, including those for the outgoing Governor, and deputy governor of financial stability.’","Spending on champagne rose by 94 per cent between 2012 and 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A school principal in Texas who allegedly banned her students from speaking Spanish in November has been told by the board she cannot return to her job. Administrators at Hempstead Middle School voted on Monday night to end the contract of Amy Lacey who has been on paid leave since December after allegedly using the intercom to tell students that Spanish was not allowed to be spoken on school grounds. The move caused outrage at the school where more than 50 percent of the children are Hispanic - leading to allegations that the children's civil rights had been violated. 'Students were shamed until they did not want to come to school anymore,' Salina Moreno, an attorney with the Latin Legal Voice, to MyFoxHouston.com. 'Non Latino students bullied Spanish speaking students and told them to go back to Mexico.' Scroll Down for Video . The Hempstead Independent School District board on Monday night decided not to retain Amy Lacey, whose contract expires at the end of the school term . Civil rights groups added in after possible hate crimes were reported in the Hempstead - a small town of 6,100, an hour outside Houston. 'When you start banning aspects of ethnicity or cultural identity, it sends the message that the child is not wanted: 'We don't want your color. We don't want your kind.' They then tend to drop out early,' said Augustin Pinedo, director of the League of United Latin American Citizens Region 18. Advocates for civil rights in Rxas said that the whole debacle may have ignited a campaign to intimidate Hispanics - including the school district's superintendent, Delma Flores Smith. They have asked for the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate, but agency officials would not confirm this. Flores-Smith said she personally has seen strange men watching her home and taking photographs of it. She claims that vandals have trashed her front yard and someone went through her garbage. All this has made her worry for her safety. Indeed, last month, school officials discovered that vandals had damaged the brakes of three Hempstead Independent School District Buses and a dead cat was found on school premises. 'A lot of this sounds like Mississippi in the 1950s and '60s,' Pinedo said during Monday night's school board according to the Houston Chronicle. Difficult choice: District officials sent a letter to parents assuring them that Spanish is not banned at the Hempstead school, where more than half of the students are Hispanic . However, Pinedo acknowledged that there was no evidence that any of these incidents are related to hate crimes. 'But when the lives of children are put in danger, that's the bottom line,' he said. 'We don't know what the reasons are. Rather than guess, we're asking the FBI to step in.' Before the vote on Monday, former school board member Kay Kloecker aid that Lacey should be re-instated and blamed Flores-Smith for causing the convection. 'We've been a predominantly Hispanic district for several years now,' she said. 'But we never had a problem until she came.' Flores-Smith started in August.","Hempstead Middle School principal Amy Lacey is to lose her job at the end of the school year .

"By . Rebecca Camber . For 118 years, it has borne witness to crimes committed throughout the land. But now the trusty pocket notebook is facing the axe as Britain’s biggest police force announces plans to roll out tablet devices to every bobby on the beat. Scotland Yard is pumping £200million into new technology which will allow officers to record crimes, check warrants and intelligence on suspects, and even order new uniforms at the touch of a button. The pilot scheme of giving 20,000 policemen iPad minis in replacement of their notebooks will be rolled out soon in Hammersmith and Fulham . Apple iPad minis will be handed to 20,000 officers in a bid to slash paperwork and get police out from their desks and back onto the streets. A pilot is launching in Spring with a trial purchase of 600 devices for officers across Hammersmith and Fulham ahead of an anticipated force-wide roll-out from autumn this year. If successful, the tablets will be handed out to every frontline officer over the next three years, making expected annual savings of 30 per cent on the current IT systems. The force will design its own apps, providing templates for recording crimes and taking witness statements, as well as giving officers access to local data such as the number of repeat victims in the area and directions to the nearest A&E department. Officers will also have an app to take evidential pictures and send victims advice directly. Richard Thwaite, the Met’s chief information officer said: ‘We want the officers out there fighting crime on the streets rather than sitting in a police station tapping on a keyboard, not solving anything. ‘Even if they are in Starbucks keying in details, then at least they are out there, visible and accessible and reassuring to the public.’ The new technology is expected to free up police time equivalent to bringing in an additional 900 officers and save £60million. The iPad mini is the smaller counterpart to the original iPad, and is intended to help officers record crimes, as well as check warrants and intelligence on suspects . But critics have questioned the huge expense at a time of unprecedented cuts to frontline officers. John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation said: ‘I remember when I walked the beat with a notebook and whistle, we really have to move on from there and I hope this will be a progressive step. ‘But there will be times when the battery runs out or there is technical problems. ‘This is a lot of money when we have just gone through a massive swathe of cuts. ‘It is always preferable to maintain police officer numbers as opposed to new pieces of equipment.’ Previous mobile devices have failed to deliver anticipated savings. In 2012, the National Audit Office found that a £80million Home Office scheme to equip officers with 50,000 smartphones had produced savings of just £600,000 out of a projected £125million. In one force, officers spent nearly two hours more per shift behind their desks instead of out on the beat. Last year the Association of Chief Police Officers warned that the Met’s own smartphone purchases could end up as ‘expensive paperweights’ unless they were properly tested, pointing out that constables were unlikely to take their gloves off to use a phone at 3am in the rain. But Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is convinced it will reduce paperwork, duplication and lead to more criminals being convicted by presenting better evidence at court. He said: ‘We are going to use technology to stop crime, arrest offenders or help victims. ‘We need to keep police officers out of police stations and reduce bureaucracy. Digital policing will help us to do this.’ The Met also wants the public to be able to report crimes using their smartphones and send a text to speak to a police officer. It hopes to shift 1million of the 5million telephone calls received each year to ‘online channels’. The force is already investing heavily in computer programming to forecast where offenders will strike next. The hope with the scheme is that it will get the police out from under their desks and back on the beat by streamlining paperwork and busywork that they have to contend with on a daily basis . In a plot straight out of the Tom Cruise film Minority Report, where a ‘pre crime’ department detains murderers before they kill, police are using computer algorithms to map out where future burglaries are likely to take place. At the same time, 1,000 body-worn video cameras are being introduced across 11 boroughs and in the training unit of the Firearms Command. The cameras will mean that the actions of armed officers will be recorded and may be used as evidence. The move comes as police are trying to win back trust following the police shooting of Mark Duggan, whose death in August 2011 sparked riots across the country. Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Stephen Greenhalgh, said: ‘By taking tough decisions on the budget and the Met Police estate, we are freeing up savings to reinvest in frontline policing and technology, so we can get more officers out on the beat and keep them mobile. ‘The public expect the police to have accurate information on-the-go, and cops deserve the best kit to help them cut crime and serve the public. The Total Technology strategy 2014-17 sets the direction for an unprecedented investment in technology - up to £200m over three years.’ ‘This strategy heralds a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernise the Met and ensure it is fully equipped for the demands of 21st century policing.’ London Assembly member Baroness Jones, who is deputy chairman of the Police and Crime Committee, said: 'This is very expensive and it should be very carefully rolled out. ‘I know myself that technology can go wrong, but the concept is a good one.’","The notebook has been a British police equipment staple for 118 years .

"By . Sam Creighton . A couple are horrified after finding a dead shrew at the bottom of a crisp packet destined for their son's lunchbox. Jonathan and Elinor Hughes found the rodent after eating their way through a large pack of lightly-salted Kettle Chips that had been delivered to their home in the Conwy Valley, Wales. Mr Hughes, 34, said: 'We bought some lightly-salted flavoured Kettle Chips and they were delivered with our Sainsbury’s shopping to our house. According to Kettle Foods's investigations, the shrew had not been in the packet for long before it was found . 'We started to eat the crisps and ate the first half of the bag. Elinor was going to split the rest of them for a packed lunch. But we were absolutely horrified to find a mouse in the bottom. 'We’d been going to put the crisps with my nine-year-old son Finlay’s lunch' Jonathan Hughes had already eaten half of the packet, with his wife Elinor, before they found the dead rodent . Mr Hughes immediately rang Kettle Foods UK and said the company asked him to send a photograph and also to put the 'foreign body' in an envelope and post it to them. However, within moments of the photograph being sent, the company rang to say a courier would collect the mouse. A spokeswoman for Kettle Foods Ltd said: 'We take food safety and quality very seriously and have stringent systems and procedures in place to ensure that every bag of KETTLE® Chips reaches our consumers in perfect condition. 'We have been consulting with Mrs Hughes since this issue came to light yesterday. We received the pack last night and have today sought independent advice from an expert Pest Control Company. 'From this we have ascertained that the dead animal is a shrew, and due to its appearance in the bag it would seem to have been dead for a relatively short period of time. 'Our investigations so far indicate that the shrew did not enter the bag at Kettle Foods, or during distribution, and therefore we need to understand how it came to be associated with our product. 'Naturally we are taking this issue seriously and will be undertaking further work to ascertain how this situation came about. 'We fully understand the anxiety that this has caused to Mr and Mrs Hughes and we will continue to liaise directly with them.'

"By . Sam Creighton . Jennifer Simpson had been meeting with the client for two years before the blackmail began . A 15-stone prostitute who worked under the name ‘Curvy Candy’ has been jailed after she blackmailed a client by threatening to tell his wife about their illicit meetings. Jennifer Simpson, 31, also made a false rape claim against the married father, who she had been meeting for two years, after he refused to pay her £500. The mother-of-two appeared at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday and was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting blackmail. The court heard how Simpson sent the client a text while he was on a family holiday abroad in January 2013, demanding he give her £500 by the end of the day. She contacted him again on May 1 and threatened to come to his house and tell his wife and business customers about their relationship if he refused to give her the money. The victim was so scared his wife and daughters would find out about his secret trysts that he agreed to pay Simpson £400. But, on May 26, she phoned the man's home landline at 6am and said she had a £1,200 drugs debt and was being threatened. He hung up but admitted what was going on to his wife when she became suspicious and confronted him about the call. The next time Simpson rang, the man’s wife answered and told her to leave her husband alone. But undeterred, she sent several texts to the victim accusing him of raping her and stealing her cash. Police arrested Simpson the next day and she pleaded guilty to blackmail on a basis she believed she was owed money but accepted her demands were unwarranted and inappropriate. Recorder Tracey Lloyd-Nesling told her: 'Blackmail is a very serious offence. 'It is aggravated by your persistence. In particular, you tried to make a false claim of rape.' Prosecutor Steven Bailey told the court the victim met Simpson through an escort service and frequently met up with her for oral sex but had not seen her since 2012. Stuart Muldoon, defending, said Simpson acted 'out of desperation'. He told the court she started working in the sex industry after losing contact with her children. A neighbour of Simpson said: 'I had no idea she was a prostitute. She kept herself to herself. 'You couldn’t really miss her though because she was a big girl. She must have been at least 15 stone but that obviously didn’t put her punters off.'","Jennifer Simpson, 31, from Stoke had been meeting the client for two years .

They are among 117 servicemen and women who received awards for gallantry. Most go to troops who served with 1 Mechanized Brigade in Afghanistan between April and October last year. The two men were among 12 British soldiers taking part in a pre-dawn raid on the Taliban in their stronghold of Yakshal in Helmand province on July 4 last year. Lance Corporal Moloney, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, and another machine-gunner were covering a patrol from the roof of a mud-walled compound. At around 6am the battlefield ‘just erupted’ with as many as 30 insurgents opening fire from all around, he said. Minutes later he was struck by a tracer round which hurled him from the roof.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A notorious beggar, who is deemed the worst in Britain, has officially been banned from begging anywhere in the UK. Sukhvender Singh Deo, who is known as Billy the Quid because he always asks passers-by for £1, has a string of Asbos to his name banning him from scrounging in the street. The 43-year-old was even jailed for two years in October 2011 after relentlessly targeting a widow over a four-year period between 2007 and 2011, begging an astonishing £35,000 from her. Sukhvender Singh Deo, who is known as Billy the Quid because he always asks passers-by for £1, has a string of Asbos to his name banning him from scrounging in the street . The court heard at the time how Deo targeted legal secretary Bridget Macedonski after she was kind to him and gave him a few pounds whenever she saw him in Chatham, Kent. Over a period of four years, Deo persuaded Mrs Macedonski to give him her mobile phone number and repeatedly called her to ask for loans of up to £100-a-time over four years. Maidstone Crown Court heard at the time that he managed to get £35,000 out of Mrs Macedonski, who had been left a sum of money when her husband died at the age of 40. Deo was jailed for two years in October 2011, getting three months for harassment, 12 months for breaching his Asbo and nine months for two counts of perverting the course of justice - all to run consecutively. But after getting out of jail last year, Deo appeared on the streets again - hanging around in old haunts in Chatham town centre, as well as other parts of Kent. Widow Bridget Macedonski, from Bromley, who ended up handing over £35,000 over a period of time to beggar Sukhvender Deo who used the money for drugs . Deo was first handed an Asbo in 2006 banning him from begging in Chatham and from engaging in behaviour 'likely to cause harassment, alarm and distress to the public'. He was handed another Asbo in 2010 banning him from begging in the county of Kent, but this week he was hauled before magistrates again - and this time banned from begging anywhere in the UK. Medway JPs heard how Deo, who admitted harassment without violence, was caught begging numerous times since August last year. Sergeant Craig West, of Kent Police, said the new Asbo would mean that Deo could be jailed if caught begging anywhere in Britain. Sukhvender Deo was jailed for two years in October 2011 after relentlessly targeting widow Bridget Macedonski over a four year period between 2007 and 2011, begging an astonishing £35,000 from her . He said: ‘If Deo is seen begging anywhere in the country, he is breaching the order. ‘If this happens he would be committing a crime and could be prosecuted.’ He said: ‘Deo is well known across the Medway Towns, particularly in Chatham, for being a nuisance and persistently harassing members of the public by aggressively begging for money. ‘People visiting our High Streets to go shopping, or to use cash machines, should be able to do so without being approached for money and faced with this type of behaviour. ‘The order is in place to protect the public from further nuisance behaviour and it is hoped that the local community is reassured by the action taken. ‘If he breaches the order, which continues until 10 March 2017, he could be arrested, charged and put before a court.’ The Asbo bans Deo from 'begging or seeking charitable donations, alms or loans from any person other than a registered charity or a financial institution, loitering in the vicinity of any cash dispensing machine, or acting in an anti-social manner that causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to anyone not of the same household as himself'. Maidstone Crown Court heard in 2011 how Deo 'relentlessly' targeted Mrs Macedonski for four years. The court heard how Deo followed legal secretary Mrs Macedonski home, pestered her in the street and sent her numerous text messages telling her he needed cash quickly. In the end Mrs Macedonski, who is in her 40s, ended up re-mortgaging her home, and eventually selling it to keep paying Deo, who said he needed the cash to pay off drug debts, telling her he 'would be killed' if he didn't pay up. Sukhvender Singh Deo, nicknamed Billy the Quid, is even listed in the Urban Dictionary because he is so well known for begging in Chatham High Street, pictured . Martin Yale, prosecuting, told the court that Deo 'preyed on Mrs Macedonski's better nature' and that she even started going to great lengths to avoid bumping into him by getting off her train three miles before her stop. He said: ‘To avoid him she would get off the train at Gillingham and then walk to Chatham, but if he didn't see her, Deo would call her mobile phone. ‘She began to feel quite intimidated.' In a victim impact statement read in court, Mrs Macedonski said: ‘The fact he has abused my trust is sad and disappointing, but I cannot help thinking that without the support of others encouraging him he would not have managed to go so far.’ Judge Martin Joy told Deo: ‘This was a wholly disgraceful course of conduct by you preying on somebody who had sought to come to your aid and you preyed on her better instincts. ‘Even now, she has considerable sympathy for you.’ Locals say Deo is 'notorious' in the area - where he has been begging for a decade. Ben Smart, 32, said: ‘I first saw Billy about 10 years ago - he always says the same thing “Alright mate, got a pound?” ‘When he was in jail it was a massive relief as he follows you up the street begging for change and it's not easy to get away from him.’ He is even listed in the Urban Dictionary because he is so well known in the area. It states: ‘Billy The Quid - Annoying homeless chap given the Asbo from Chatham High Street. ‘So called because he never fails to ask passers-by for a quid.’ In 2011, Sukhvender Singh Deo was jailed at Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, for targeting legal secretary Bridget Macedonski and repeatedly calling her asking for loans of up to £100-a-time .","Sukhvender Singh Deo was jailed in 2011 after begging £35,000 from widow .

"By . Dan Bloom . The first charges in British history over female genital mutilation have been brought against two men - one of whom is a doctor. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 31, who was working at the Whittington Hospital in north London, and 40-year-old Hasan Mohamed, who is not a medic, will face charges under the Female Genital Mutilation Act. It is claimed the doctor from Ilford, east London, carried out the procedure on a woman who had given birth at the hospital's maternity unit in November 2012. Mohamed, of Holloway, north London, is accused of encouraging and helping him, prosecutors said. Arrest: The first charges in British history for causing female genital mutilation have been brought against two men. One, Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, works at the Whittington Hospital in north London . The men were interviewed under caution in August last year and today the Crown Prosecution Service announced it was charging them. Dr Dharmasena qualified from the University of London in 2005 with a bachelor's degree in surgery, according to General Medical Council records. He is not listed as a specialist or GP. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The charges follow an investigation by officers from Islington borough after an allegation was reported to police via a third party. 'Various inquiries were carried out in consultation with the CPS and in August 2013 two men were interviewed under caution. 'A file was submitted to the CPS who have today taken the decision to charge the two individuals.' A Whittington Hospital spokesman told MailOnline: 'Concerns were raised by Whittington health clinicians in November 2012 following a patient giving birth in our maternity unit. 'The Trust took these concerns extremely seriously, immediately launching our own investigation and reported them to Islington Police. Charges: The Whittington Hospital. It has not been said where the procedure is alleged to have taken place . Court hearing: The pair who have been charged are due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court . The tradition originated in ethnic groups spread throughout 28 African countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, and spread across the world as groups emigrated. The circumcision or 'cutting' is carried out for cultural reasons, often because it shows a girl's virginity on her wedding night. FGM is defined as any partial or full removal of a woman's outer sexual organs. It can also involve sewing up the vagina. In cultures where the tradition is common, 'uncut' girls can be thought more likely to be promiscuous, unhygienic, and prone to diseases such as HIV/Aids. The procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman with no medical training and without any anaesthetic or antiseptics, risking infection. Their basic tools include knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. Iodine or a mixture of herbs is placed on the wound to tighten the vagina and stop the bleeding. Prosecutors in today's case have not specified what type of procedure is alleged to have been carried out. It is thought as many as 66,000 women in the UK have suffered FGM with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk. Source: MailOnline / Forward UK . 'We referred the matter to what was then the London Deanery (now Health Education North Central and East London) which is the appropriate training authority. 'The Trust has its own specialist Female Genital Mutilation service. The staff have extensive experience in dealing with FGM, the sensitive issues surrounding it and providing support to women.' The charges come less than five months after MPs launched a major inquiry into the cultural practice, which is thought to have been carried out on around 66,000 women and girls in Britain. Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith . Vaz said he wanted to tackle the reasons why no one had ever been . charged with FGM offences since the practice was criminalised in 1985. Today prosecutors . said they had also looked at four other cases - one of which was new . and three that were reconsidered after decisions to take no further . action - and found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges. One . of the old cases involved a man calling an FGM helpline, intended for . victims, to ask for the procedure to be carried out on his two . daughters. The new case involved two parents accused of taking their . daughter abroad to have FGM. The CPS would not give details of the other two cases. The pair who have been charged will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on April 15. FGM has been a criminal offence since 1985, and in 2003 the maximum sentence was increased from five to 14 years in jail. Prosecutors are considering another four cases of alleged FGM, and are in early discussions with police about another two. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who will appear before the Home Affairs committee next week, said: 'The CPS was asked to consider evidence in relation to this allegation of female genital mutilation by the Metropolitan Police Service. Accused: The pair's hearing on April 15 will be their first appearance before magistrates . 'It was alleged that following a . patient giving birth in November 2012, a doctor at the Whittington . Hospital, in London, repaired FGM [female genital mutilation] that had . previously been performed on the patient, allegedly carrying out FGM . himself.' Dr Dharmasena has been charged with an offence contrary to section 1(1) of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, police said. The section specifically forbids anyone from removing or mutilating part of a woman's genitals. Mohamed . has been charged with two counts - intentionally encouraging an offence . of FGM under section 44(1) of the Serious Crime Act 2007, and aiding, . abetting, counselling or procuring Dr Dharmasena to commit an offence . under section 1(1) of the FGM Act. Speaking generally, Ms Saunders told the Evening Standard it is notoriously difficult to bring charges under FGM laws because victims are afraid to give evidence. 'It . is a very difficult injury to talk about,' she said. 'It is an abuse of . their body and it is not a part of the body that people want to talk . about in public.' The Home Affairs Select Committee, led by MP Keith Vaz, pictured, is investigating the practice of FGM . Commander Mak Chishty, Britain's top . police officer in charge of FGM cases, said in a statement: 'Across the . country, police are working extensively to investigate and build strong . cases against those suspected of inflicting or aiding or abetting female . genital mutilation (FGM). 'Today’s charging decision demonstrates how much gravity the police, prosecutors and government places on ending FGM. 'Female genital mutilation is a . barbaric crime that has no place in modern day Britain. The police are . committed to working closely with health services, schools, colleges, . social services and third sector organisations which have an . understanding of this form of abuse and can help us reach those who may . be at risk. 'Prosecutions of those who continue this horrific and outdated practice should signal a warning to those who’ve committed or are considering inflicting female genital mutilation as well as anyone who assists them or stays quiet when they know this abuse been committed. 'We are pursuing offenders and working to bring them to justice so that we can protect victims – some of them painfully young - and stamp out this appalling crime.' The NSPCC's head of child protection John Cameron added: 'Today’s announcement by the Crown Prosecution Service sends out a strong message that they are taking FGM seriously.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Defence giant BAE Systems today sounded the alarm on the risks of Scottish independence. The firm, which employs 37,000 people in the UK, warned Scotland remaining in the 300-year-old union offers ‘greater certainty and stability for our business’. It is the latest major business to highlight the dangers of backing independence in September’s referendum, after similar interventions from Shell, BP and Standard Life. BAE Systems raised the prospect of leaving its bases north of the border, including Scotstoun, if voters back independence in September's referendum . BAE’s chief executive Ian King had previously refused to be drawn into the debate over the future of Scotland. But in the firm’s annual report published today, he breaks his silence to back the union. Writing a review of the year, Mr King said: ‘In September 2014, Scotland will hold an independence referendum. ‘The decision on independence from the UK is a matter for the people of Scotland. ‘However, BAE Systems has significant interests and employees in Scotland, and it is clear that continued union offers greater certainty and stability for our business. ‘In the event that Scotland voted to . become independent, we would need to discuss the way forward with the . Ministry of Defence and UK government, and work with them to deliver the . best solution in those circumstances.’ The UK government leapt on the remarks as the latest major warning from big business about the impact on jobs in Scotland if it goes it alone. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: ‘There is an increasing chorus of people from business who know that it is in the interests of the UK and their employees to remain part of the United Kingdom.’ Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said there was a growing chorus of opposition to independence form business . Generator and heating supplier Aggreko has warned Scottish independence would lead to 'years of uncertainty and hiatus' for the business. Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, the Macfarlane Group and Breedon Aggregates have all listed independence in their risk management sections of their annual reports. But other high-profile business figures have voiced support for independence, including Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways' parent company, who said last month that a Yes vote in September could be a 'positive development'. Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell, also warned of the economic risks of Scotland voting in favour of independence. Mr van Beurden said: ‘We’d like to see Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom. ‘Shell has a long history of involvement in the North Sea – and therefore in Scotland – and we have continued to invest heavily there.’ Lloyds - which has its registered headquarters in Edinburgh - said it had concerns over a potential compliance costs and funding in the event of a ‘yes’ vote at the referendum. It said: ‘The impact of a yes vote in favour of Scottish independence is uncertain.’ But it added that: ‘the outcome could have a ‘material impact on compliance costs, the tax position and funding for the group’.","Global defence employs 37,000 people across the United Kingdom .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Nadia lee, nicknamed the 'Pigeon Lady of Pimlico', pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court where she was handed a . one year supervision order for breaching an ASBO banning her from feeding birds . A pensioner nicknamed the ‘Pigeon Lady of Pimlico’ has walked free from court despite flouting an ASBO banning her from feeding the birds near her home. Nadia Lee, 67, spent 25 years feeding the pigeons on the streets of the London borough, giving them homeopathic therapy and taking injured birds to a sanctuary. She became renowned for putting pigeons in her Gucci handbag and taking them to her £750,000 Georgian maisonette where she rubbed their wings with lavender. However, she was handed an ASBO in December 2011 after neighbours complained their cars and homes were being splattered with bird droppings and the feed was attracting rats. But Lee ignored the order and was found to have breached it on October 14, 2012, following a trial at Southwark Crown Court in January this year. During the trial, the jury were unable to agree on two further alleged breaches in July 2012, which were discharged. Privately educated Lee, a former secretary and pilot’s daughter, was deemed unfit to plead to the charges due to suffering from multiple personality disorder. Medical reports also found Lee was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and stress. Sentencing Lee to a one year supervision order, Judge Martin Beddoe warned her: ‘I remind you, Ms Lee, your ASBO is still in place. ‘As far as I am able to tell, you are capable of complying with that order. If you fail to comply with it, you may well be prosecuted again.’ In the event of a further breach, the court may rule she is fit to plead, Judge Beddoe said. ‘The powers of the court in those circumstances, in dealing with any breach of your ASBO, may prove to be more extensive,’ he added. Wearing a blue sweater and dark jeans grey-haired Lee was permitted to sit outside of the glass-enclosed dock for the 30-minute hearing. She showed no emotion as the ruling was made. The pensioner has been forced to sell her home due to financial difficulties and move out of the area, the court heard. Nadia Lee, 67, pictured centre, outside Southwark Crown Court today accompanied by two friends . When the ASBO was originally granted, Lee said she had turned into a self-styled ‘bin lady’ after her mother’s death two decades ago. Seven residents and two council officials told how they were unable to enjoy the roof terraces and gardens of their multi-million pound homes because of pigeon droppings. One neighbour, Austen Iverleigh, said: ‘She generates squalor on an industrial scale. ‘Whenever I have spoken to her, she has been very polite and I am sure that in any other respect, she is a very nice and reasonable person. ‘The problem is the feeding of pigeons on a huge scale, which causes serious disturbance to those around her. I have seen rats in her basement.’ Southwark Crown Court, pictured, heard how Lee spent 25 years feeding pigeons in Pimlico and took them home to her £750,000 Georgian mansion to rub lavender into their wings . Egyptian-born Lee told the court: ‘You cannot rescue pigeons without putting down seed and getting them all together. ‘I then catch them in a net, which I carry with me everywhere I go. ‘Then I put them in Gucci bags hanging off my pram. I take them home and take the string off their feet, rub them in lavender and treat them with homeopathy. ‘If they are too injured, I take them to a pigeon sanctuary. I love them and they depend on me because I have raised them all their lives.’ Duncan Jones, for the defence, said Lee was ‘an extremely vulnerable person’ and had ‘suffered greatly’ as a result of her court ordeal. He said: ‘She has had considerable difficulties in her life. ‘This whole experience has really been very traumatic for Ms Lee’. Lee will be supervised by probation for 12 months.","Nadia Lee was banned from feeding pigeons in the street in December 2011 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Suleman Maknojioa denies seven counts of sexually touching a child . A religious teacher put his hand under a schoolgirl's headscarf and touched her sexually as she prayed, a court heard. The attacks allegedly took place as he gave religious lessons to the girl - who is of primary school age - and her brothers. Suleman Maknojioa, 40, of Blackburn, Lancashire, was said to have 'squeezed' the youngster's chest, by placing his hand beneath the long folds of her headscarf. He denies seven counts of sexually touching a child. Giving evidence by video link yesterday, the youngster cried as she told Preston Crown Court she was 'afraid of what he would do'. She said the problems began some months after she started tuition of the Koran in Arabic. She said inappropriate touching, which had occurred over several months, started 'gradually', beginning with the arms and head, then moving to the legs, feet and chest and her thigh. Her brother, who also gave evidence, told how he and his sibling had noticed 'inappropriate' touching of his sister and favouritism towards her. The girl told the court that touching had typically occurred as she prayed; kneeling or cross-legged while reading from the Koran. She said: 'He would put his hand under my head scarf on my chest and he would squeeze. 'He would only use the one hand. The other hand would be writing something or he would be pointing to my brothers and telling them to pray harder. 'No matter how hard my brothers tried to pray it wasn't good enough. He would always say I was better even if I wasn't. 'My brothers asked me what he had been doing and I didn't know how to describe it. I told them he had touched me up.' Giving evidence by video link yesterday, the youngster cried as she told Preston Crown Court she was 'afraid of what he would do' She became tearful as she added: 'They told me to tell mum and dad - but I just didn't want to tell anyone.' Under cross examination, the girl was asked if it was not just 'reasonable' pats on the shoulder to say 'well done'. She replied: 'No, it wasn't like that. It was never to say well done. It went on for ages, his hand going up and down. You don't do that to say ""well done"".' Defending Maknojioa, Frida Hussain asked if she disliked the lessons. The girl replied: 'Yes, because I was afraid of what my teacher would do.' Giving evidence, her brother said: 'I knew what was happening for about a month before my parents. My sister would get very upset at the idea of anyone knowing. It was difficult for me to know what to do. 'He favoured her and praised her. He would give her 10 pages to learn and we would only get three. That way he spent most of the lesson with her. He did it slyly so we didn't notice. 'When it happened she was trying to pray and he would interrupt her.' He added: 'I have seen him touching her thigh in a stroking motion.' The defence barrister asked: 'Was it in fact a reasonable teacher and pupil relationship where touching was done to console her?' The brother said: 'No, it was inappropriate.' The trial continues.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Toast: George Osborne is the toast of British drinkers after cutting the price of a pint by 1p . The Chancellor today made a pre-election bid for popularity by announcing cuts to the price of beer and bingo in the penultimate Budget before Britain heads to the polls next year. George Osborne cut duty on every pint of beer by 1p, froze tax on cider and spirits and scrapped plans to increase duty on wine above the rate of inflation. The move is part of a populist push by the Chancellor to undo the damage caused by measures such as the hated 'pasty tax' featured in the 2012 Budget, which drew a massive backlash amidst accusation the Government was out of touch with ordinary people. Mr Osborne provided a . boost to the flood-hit West Country by freezing duty on cider, while the . announcement that the price of spirits will not rise was apparently . aimed at Scotland ahead of autumn's independence referendum. 'Pubs saved, jobs created, a penny off a pint for the second year running,' the Chancellor said. The brewing industry said the move will protect 7,000 jobs, mainly of younger people working in pubs and bars. Brigid . Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, . said: ‘This is fantastic news, and George Osborne is again the toast of . Britain’s brewers, pubs and pubgoers. ‘It also shows that the Government has understood our case, that taxes on British beer had become far too high, and action was long overdue. ‘I hope this becomes a trend in future budgets for this British-made, lower-strength drink.’ Mr Osborne used the Budget to offer headline-grabbing tax cuts to voters after years of austerity . Mike Benner, chief executive of the . Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), said: ‘Camra is delighted to see the . Chancellor implementing an unprecedented second consecutive cut of 1p in . beer duty. This is not only about keeping the price of a pint . affordable in British pubs but helping an industry which has been in . overall decline continue on its long road to recovery. ‘Camra . cares greatly about the future of the great British pub and it is clear . from this Budget announcement that the Government do too. ‘Keeping the price . of a pint affordable is vital for the long-term health of the pub sector . and Camra would hope this latest vote of confidence in British pubs . will go some way to slowing the rate of closures, by encouraging more . people to make use of their local this summer. ‘No . doubt many of our 160,000 members will be raising a glass to the . Chancellor this evening to toast another brilliant Budget for British . beer drinkers.’ Safeguard: The beer industry said Osborne's move will protect 7,000 jobs . In a further boost for publicans, Mr Osborne announced plans to scrap above-inflation tax duties on alcohol - despite warnings from health experts in the run-up to the Budget. In February, the Alcohol Health Alliance warned that axing the escalator would be 'madness', and called on the Chancellor to maintain the alcohol duty escalator - which normally goes up by inflation plus 2% each year. Chancellor George Osborne has ignored advice from leading medics by abandoning above-inflation tax duties on alcohol. In February, the Alcohol Health Alliance warned that axing the alcohol duty escalator would be 'madness', and in a letter to Mr Osborne said if the rise was to be screapped it would put 'even more pressure on public services and frontline workers'. The alliance - which is made up of leading health bodies including the Royal College of Physicians, the British Medical Association, charity Alcohol Concern and the Institute of Alcohol Studies - called on Mr Osborne to maintain the alcohol duty escalator - which normally goes up by inflation plus 2% each year. Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: 'Today's announcement to scrap the alcohol duty escalator is staggering. With alcohol costing the country £21 billion a year, and alcohol-related hospital admissions more than doubling over the last ten years, it comes as a shock to learn that the Chancellor believes that it is right to further incentivise drinking by making alcohol cheaper. 'Alcohol is 61per cent more affordable today than it was in 1980 and current duty rates for strong white cider amount to just 6p per unit. 'Yet the Chancellor appears to think that this isn't cheap enough. 'This decision, similar to the u-turn on minimum pricing, has been taken following an intense and aggressive lobbying campaign from the drinks industry. It is yet more evidence to suggest the Government has turned its back on public health and frontline workers such as nurses and police offers, who have to mop up the mess that alcohol creates day in day out.' But Mr Osborne scrapped the escalator, saying: 'We've introduced new laws to prevent alcohol being sold below minimum tax rates, and this helps prevent supermarkets undercutting pubs, and helps stop problem drinking. 'It's a far more targeted approach than the alcohol duty escalator hated by many responsible drinkers.' He said that the duties on alcohol would rise with inflation, but other alcohol duties have been frozen altogether. 'Scottish Whisky is a huge British success story,' he said. 'To support that industry, instead of raising duties on whisky and other spirits, I am today going to freeze them. 'And with some cider makers in the West Country hit hard by the recent weather, I am going to help them by freezing the duty on ordinary cider too.' Eric Appleby, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, questioned the move. He said: 'Once again this Government has cast aside the health of the nation to protect the interests of big alcohol. 'The notion that this freeze is about protecting responsible drinkers is irresponsible spin - alcohol misuse costs us all £21 billion a year, our hospitals weigh under the burden of it and our police forces are stretched to the limit because of it. Instead of taking serious, evidence-based action the Chancellor has given the alcohol industry the green light to make bigger profits at all of our expense. 'This freeze makes a mockery of the Government's ban on below cost sales, rendering it even less effective than it would have been. 'Until we treat alcohol misuse as the huge public health issue it is, like smoking, we will all continue to pay billions to deal with it.' Meanwhile, bingo players will now be able to claim bigger prizes after gambling duty was slashed from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, lower than the 15 per cent for online gambling and betting on horse races. Bingo clubs are closing at a rate of one a month, according to the Bingo Association. More than 1,000 jobs have been lost since 2012. The industry had promised to invest an extra £30million in new clubs, better community facilities and more jobs if the duty was reduced to 15 per cent. A petition signed by 300,000 people backing the Boost Bingo campaign was presented to Number 11 Downing Street last month. However, The Chancellor was critcised by health campaigners for missing an opportunity to end the ‘ridiculous’ situation of a pack of cigarettes costing less in real terms than it did in the 1960s. Tobacco duty will rise by two per cent above inflation, and the escalator will be extended for the rest of the next Parliament. Winners: Bingo players will now be able to claim bigger prizes after gambling duty was slashed from 20 per cent to 10 per cent . Money Dashboard has analysed the spending of 20,000 users to work out the current UK average spending on alcohol and cigarettes and how today’s Budget increases will affect it over the course of a year.For Alcohol:•The average UK spend on alcohol was previously £1,708 per year. Following the 2014 Budget, this will increase only at the rate of inflation to £1727.76 - a yearly increase of £19.76. Beer drinkers, who saw a 1p cut per pint, will save on average £5.63 per year. For Cigarettes:•The average UK spend on cigarettes was previously £565 per year. Following the 2014 Budget, this will increase to £634.06 - a yearly increase of £69.06. Gavin Littlejohn, Founder and CEO of Money Dashboard comments: 'With taxation on things like cigarettes and alcohol increasing, your average consumer will need to look long and hard at their finances to see where these additional costs will come from. Whilst a 2% increase in tax on cigarettes above inflation may not sound like much, over the course of the year, it could in fact jeopardise the chance to buy that dress or suit you've had your eye on.' British Lung Foundation chief executive Dr Penny Woods said: ‘By not heeding the recommendations of health experts to increase tobacco taxation by five per cent above inflation, the Chancellor has missed a great opportunity to help put an end to this ridiculous situation in which a pack of cigarettes today costs less in real terms than it did in the 1960s. ‘This Government has made encouraging moves on issues such as standardised packaging and smoking in cars carrying children to try and cut the impact smoking has on the nation's health. ‘However, with research showing taxes to be one of the most effective tools in encouraging people to quit smoking, medical professionals and health campaigners around the country will be disappointed with the Chancellor's decision not to use this tool to the extent so many of them have called for. ‘A five per cent real terms increase in tobacco taxation may only have increased the cost of a pack of cigarettes by a few pence, but the evidence suggests it could have saved thousands of lives into the future.’ The Tobacco Retailers' Alliance (TRA) said the 2% increase played into the hands of tobacco smugglers. TRA spokeswoman Debbie Corris said: ‘With the Chancellor's announcement, smugglers will now make even more profit, encouraging more of them to ply their illegal trade in communities across the UK, selling to customers no matter what their age. ‘This in turn will mean lost sales for legitimate retailers like myself.’ Giving his reaction to the Budget 2014, John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: 'Business wanted a Budget that was disciplined, focused, and geared towards the creation of wealth and jobs – and that’s what the Chancellor has delivered. 'As with any Budget, there were some populist measures that were not at the top of business’s wish list. Luckily, these were far outweighed by considered measures to support business growth and wealth creation.'","The beer industry said the price cut has safeguarded 7,000 jobs .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A Chinese takeaway which had mouse droppings on the floor and no toilet seat has been shut after an inspector said it was the worst he’d seen. Tiger King in Portsmouth, Hampshire, was so filthy it was branded a risk to public health and immediately closed. The horrified inspector, who went to the takeaway after a tip-off from a disgruntled customer, found a chicken defrosting in a bucket on the kitchen floor, food stores on low dirty shelves and mouse droppings coating the floor. Revolting: A hygiene inspector found this chicken defrosting in a bucket of water left on a dirty floor . Dirty: Staff, who had nowhere to wash their hands, had to use this toilet with no seat . Closed down: The Tiger King in Portsmouth was shut down immediately by the inspector . Staff were forced to use a toilet with no seat and were left with nowhere to wash their hands. Owner Daniel Fan has now been banned from running a food business for six months. Richard Lee, Portsmouth City Council’s environmental health manager, said it was one of the worst hygiene breaches he had seen in 20 years. He said: 'The problems we found at Tiger King were some of the worst we’ve ever encountered. 'The deterioration in the standards was considerable over a short period of time. 'The operator was putting the health of . his customers at considerable risk and, consequently, I’m pleased with . the decision of the court.' Grimy: The floor of the kitchen was filthy, and the inspector also noted that mouse droppings could be seen . Grim: The King Prawn was given the lowest possible hygiene rating - one out of five . After an inspection last week, the takeaway was given a one out of five hygiene rating. Fan was fined £5,000 and had to pay £1,253 pounds in costs at Portsmouth Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to five offences relating to food hygiene. Magistrate Avril Hardie said: 'There were a number of offences and the number of, nature and extent of the offences makes us feel like the hygiene prohibition order is justified along with the fines.' A city council spokesman said: 'The premises will continue to be monitored and any further legal contraventions noted with will be dealt with in accordance with our enforcement policy.'","Tiger King in Portsmouth was given a surprise inspection last week .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Staff at Ofsted have run up bills of nearly £4million at the taxpayer’s expense on luxury hotels and gourmet meals. Spending covered by the quango’s credit cards included stays in a five-star resort in Cyprus, dining at some of London’s finest restaurants and drinking in champagne bars. The watchdog, in charge of inspecting schools in England, disclosed the credit card bills under the Freedom of Information Act. They were run up by around 450 Ofsted officials and inspectors over the past five years. Lap of luxury: The Colombia Beach Resort in Cyprus where Ofsted inspectors spent £1,109 . Staff spent £1,108.72 at the five-star Columbia Beach Resort in Cyprus, which has a private beach and numbers celebrities including Kim Cattrall and Jack Dee among previous guests. Ofsted said the stay was linked to the inspection of a British military school in Cyprus. A bill for £5,297.97, plus £80.80 for dining, was run up in nine months at a private members’ club, the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall, London. Further spending included £470.49 at Les Deux Salons, run by two Michelin-starred chefs, and £323.40 at the Gordon Ramsay-run Savoy Grill. Ofsted said the bills were run up carrying out inspections, attending international conferences or on fact-finding missions, and include fuel and parking as well as meals and hotels. It insisted that its policy is ‘very clear’ that alcohol cannot be claimed for. It added that £585 charged to a card during a stay at the Grand Hotel Aminta in Sorrento, Italy was a ‘personal transaction made in error’ and was repaid. Details emerged at a turbulent time for Ofsted, which came under fire earlier this week with claims that its judgments were less reliable ‘than flipping a coin’. Spending on its credit cards ballooned to £1.63million in 2009/10 before dropping to £501,154 in 2011/12, the figures show. But the sums are creeping up again despite a pledge by David Cameron to crack down on spending on government-funded cards. Ofsted’s credit card bill is expected to reach £727,963 for 2013/14, bringing the total for the past five years to £3.9million. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Ofsted is meant to spend its time and budget inspecting schools, not on fine dining in the West End. When its inspectors do have to travel they should stay in modest accommodation and certainly not five-star hotels or private members’ clubs.’ An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Ofsted inspectors, by the nature of their work, spend a great deal of time away from home and the office. 'There are robust controls in place to ensure the strict rules governing business expense claims by our employees are adhered to. Our policy is very clear that alcohol cannot be claimed.’ The Policy Exchange think-tank claimed this week that Ofsted inspectors’ judgments were often unreliable, saying: ‘Ofsted needs to operate in an environment where... it can achieve more with less.’ Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw yesterday promised a series of reforms to the way the quango operates. These include shorter and more frequent school inspections, to raise confidence in its processes. Thousands of schools face major disruption next week as teachers stage a national strike in a long-running dispute over pay and pensions. More than half of schools across England and Wales are expected to operate reduced timetables or even close on Wednesday as members of the National Union of Teachers stage a one-day walkout. Head teachers warned that many schools would be unable to open.","Over five years 450 inspectors spent £4million on dining and hotels .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Troubled: George Hollis already had a lengthy criminal record before this week's charges for child pornography possession . A Texas man with a history of mental problems was found to have almost  two million child pornography images on his computer when his parents called 911 during a bi-polar episode, police said. The family of George Hollis, 24, of Deer Park, called police last June because they believed he was high on drugs and having a mental breakdown because he was running naked through his home and around the neighborhood in only his underwear, KHOU reported. It took federal agents months to uncover all of the images after the June 25 bust, a source told the station. He was hit this week with five separate felony child pornography possession charges. Hollis mother said he ‘had been running through the house naked, punching holes in the wall, knocking pictures off the wall and running through the neighborhood wearing nothing but his underwear,’ police said. The troubled man’s father added that he is bi-polar and self-medicates with cocaine and marijuana. Police responding to the parents’ desperate plea for help began searching the home for drugs when they found the explicit images as they displayed on a screen saver, according to court documents cited by KHOU. The computer monitors were inside a walk-in closet, and were hooked up to a computer with nearly two million images showing children between what experts believe are the ages of six and 16-years-old, a source told the station. Officers quickly moved to obtain a search warrant as the manic man was taken to a local hospital. Computers, external hard drives and USB drives were seized by the police as Hollis’ horrified parents came to grips with their son’s alleged depravity. A relative told First Coast News that Hollis’ parents were devastated by the discovery. ‘If they would have had any thoughts [about that], they would have taken his computer away from him,’ said the uncle. ‘They're devastated.’ Police are confident, despite the . staggering amount of child pornography discovered, that Hollis posed no . threat to area children. Out of control: Hollis' parents said they called the police because he was running around their home naked and punching holes in the walls before sprinting around the neighborhood in just his underwear . ‘All the indications that we got were that he was strictly doing this stuff on the Internet,’ a Deer Park Police spokesperson told FCN. It still didn't sit well with his neighbors. 'Two million pictures? That's an awful lot,' one said to KHOU with a look of disbelief on his face. Hollis is sitting in Harris County Jail on a $150,000 bond, $30,000 for each of the five felony charges. This is not his first brush with the law, records showed. Hollis has three prior DWI convictions, the most recent in 2009 resulted in a six year home confinement and two year suspension of his driver’s license. He has also been convicted of criminal mischief and marijuana possession.","George Hollis, 24, was found to have the child pornography stash after his parents called 911 fearing he was high on drugs, police said .

"By . Mark Duell . Up to 170million children in China will undergo drug tests, after it was revealed hundreds of pupils were secretly being given antiviral medication by their schools. China's education ministry has ordered a nationwide investigation into the issue after a demonstration by parents of kindergarteners who were given the drugs. The probe comes a week after an angry protest by parents whose children were allegedly given moroxydine hydrochloride - a drug invented in the 1950s to halt the spread of flu - in Xi'an city. Demonstration: Parents protest outside the Hong Ji kindergarten in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, last week after discovering their children had been secretly fed drugs . Some children suffered stomach pain, dizziness and other symptoms but authorities say it is unclear whether it was linked to the drug. Police in Xi'an said two kindergartens gave children the medication to improve attendance rates and boost their incomes. Detectives said they have detained suspects and are determining how extensively the medication was used. A kindergarten in the city of Jilin also was found to be giving the drug to students. Authorities shut down a Yichang kindergarten after its president admitted giving pupils an over-the-counter anti-fever drug and vitamins to boost immunity and attendance, Xinhua News Agency said. Anger: Police said two schools gave children the drugs to improve attendance rates and boost their incomes . Location: The probe comes a week after an angry protest by parents whose children were allegedly given moroxydine hydrochloride - a drug invented in the 1950s to halt the spread of flu - in Xi'an city . Parents only found out about the secret drugs at a kindergarten in Xi’an earlier this month when one boy told his mother that he had been ‘taking medicine’ to ensure he would ‘never get sick again’. The scandals in China have raised public concerns over the safety and health of schoolchildren at kindergartens, where fees are paid only for the days they attend. Chinese officials said they would conduct a ‘thorough, one-by-one’ inspection of every kindergarten, primary school and middle school in the country, reported the Daily Telegraph. The Government said it would ‘investigate whether kindergartens are illegally organising the medication of groups of infants’ - and report back by April 15.","China's education ministry orders nationwide investigation into issue .

"By . Dan Bloom . The only English professional footballer ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross is being given a new memorial almost 100 years after he died. Donald Bell, the first of 2,000 footballers to enlist in the First World War, was honoured by George V after he dashed across open ground to attack a German machine gun post and killed 50 men. The full-back with Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bradford Park Avenue - who told his mother the victory was the 'biggest fluke alive' - was killed just five days later in a similar assault. Hero: Donald Bell, pictured before and after war broke out, was the first of 2,000 footballers to enlist in the First World War and the only English professional footballer ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery . Honour: Bell's memorial near Contalmaison, France (pictured when it was unveiled in 2000 with Bell's great niece Joanna Umpleby) will be renovated and have a new headstone and plaque commemorating his efforts . Now the memorial that was erected to him near the French village of Contalmaison, on a spot renamed Bell's Redoubt, is gaining a new memorial stone and plaque honouring his efforts. It comes four years after the Professional Footballers' Association bought his medal at auction for £252,000 - at the time the third highest price ever paid for a VC. Valuable: Bell's VC was auctioned for £252,000 . The second lieutenant in the 9th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment, crossed the English Channel in June 1915 and reached the Western Front before the Battle of the Somme. Before the war he had played as an amateur with Crystal Palace and Newcastle before signing with Bradford Park Avenue, who he helped win promotion to the First Division. On July 5 1916, Bell's battalion - known as the Green Howards - was given orders to capture a German position known as Horseshoe Trench near the French village of Contalmaison. Disregarding his own safety, he crept up on a communication trench and dashed across open ground to attack the German machine gun post. Bell then killed the gunner with his revolver, blew up several more soldiers with hand grenades and threw more bombs into a dugout, killing 50 of the enemy. In a letter to his mother, the modest soldier from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, wrote: 'I must confess that it was the biggest fluke alive and I did nothing. I chucked the bomb and it did the trick.' He added: 'I believe God is watching over me and it rests with him whether I pull through or not.' But Bell was killed just five days later as his battalion attacked another machine gun post. Described by officers as having 'the courage of a lion', Bell was buried near Contalmaison after the war. His body was later moved but a permanent memorial was erected about 20 yards from where he fell in 2000. Fitting memorial: The new stone honouring Bell, pictured being finished by Neil Collinson, contains an account of his bravery in battle in English and French. It will be placed near the French village of Contalmaison . Mr Collinson said: 'Some of the guys feel we have got to know Donald Bell. We have been totally enthralled' He was given Britain's highest military honour posthumously to remember his efforts. Incredibly one of his closest friends from Harrogate Grammar School, Archie White, was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallantry in the 6th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment. A report in the London Gazette in September 1916 praised Bell's 'most conspicuous bravery'. When Lord Kitchener launched his famous 'Your Country Needs You' campaign, tens of thousands of men enlisted. But the FA was slower to take up the challenge. Despite opposition, matches were played throughout the 1914-15 season and the FA Cup was held as normal. Many teams, however, grasped their sense of duty with both hands. In November 1914, Hearts of Midlothian were leading the First Division when 16 players left mid-season to fight in the Great War - becoming the first professional team to enlist en masse. The men were part of the First and 16th Royal Scots who fought in the vicious Battle of the Somme, which killed three members of the team. Losing seven men altogether was not the only reason Hearts became heroes. It was said that their bold mass sacrifice of pitches the trenches inspired other footballers to do the same. A memorial erected to the team in 1922  still stands in Haymarket, Edinburgh. It read: 'This very brave act saved many lives and ensured the success of the attack. Five days later this very gallant officer lost his life after performing a very similar act of bravery.' Now, in the centenary year of the war's outbreak, the Friends of the Green Howards have arranged for a new memorial stone to be placed where he died. A new plaque will read: 'Second Lieutenant Donald S Bell was awarded the Victoria Cross for attacking and destroying an enemy machine gun post on 5th July 1916 at Horseshoe Trench, one kilometre to the west of this memorial thus saving many lives. 'Five days later he lost his life at this location whilst performing a similar act, contributing to the success of the attack and the capture of this village. 'Later this place was officially named Bell's Redoubt. 'Donald Bell was the first English professional footballer to enlist in 1914 and the only player to be awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy.' The work has been funded by the Professional Footballers' Association and the stone will be erected this summer. Neil Collinson, the owner of stonemasons Dales of Thirsk, said: 'We have been thrilled to be part of the project. 'Some of the guys have been looking through the details and feel that we have got to know Donald Bell. They have been totally enthralled by his story.' Before the war Bell trained to be a teacher at Westminster College in London and was made assistant master at Starbeck Council School near Harrogate.","Donald Bell was the only English professional footballer to be awarded VC .

"By . Jill Reilly . Portuguese police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have revealed they questioned a heroin addict in connection with sex attacks on five young British girls in the Algarve. Euclides Monteiro, 40, who died in a freak tractor accident in 2009, worked at the Ocean Club Resort in Praia da Luz, which Maddie disappeared from  - he was sacked a year before she vanished. Now it has been revealed that Portuguese investigators suspected Monteiro of being involved in the sexual abuse of five girls at holiday homes in the region between 2004 and 2006. Portuguese police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (right)  questioned Euclides Monteiro, (left) a  heroin addict in connection with sex attacks on five young British girls . Resort: Madeleine went missing from this holiday apartment at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz in May 2007. Monteiro worked at the Ocean Club Resort in Praia da Luz, Portugal, which Maddie disappeared from and was sacked a year before she vanished . A Portuguese police source told The Mirror: 'These cases were investigated by local police and Monteiro was arrested. No charges were brought due to lack of evidence.' This week British detectives increased tension with their Portuguese counterparts, who claim they came up the link first in October, when they announced they are looking for a prolific paedophile who was suspected of breaking into holiday properties where British families were staying and sexually abusing five white British girls aged between seven and 10. In six of the break-ins, the man sat on or got into bed with young girls. On one occasion, he abused two young girls in the same villa. Questioned: Luisa Rodrigues said she could not remember the night of Madeleine's disappearance - but was sure he would have been at home watching television at the time . Two of the attacks were in the resort . of Praia da Luz, where Madeleine was staying in a holiday apartment with . her family when she was taken. There . were also four in Carvoeiro and six in the Vale da Parra, Praia da Gale . district and most of the attacks took place in low season. They . had previously been discounted by Portuguese investigators because they . are spread over a wide geographical area and there were no apparent . attempts at abduction. Nine . of the 12 incidents were reported to Portuguese police at the time they . happened, and details of three of those became known to British . investigators only after they made televised appeals last autumn. New clue: Detectives on the Madeleine case say the man they are looking for wore a distinctive burgundy top . Monteiro was sacked a year before the McCann family arrived at the holiday resort after he was caught stealing from the resort - one theory was that he may have abducted the British girl to get revenge on his former employers. The Mail has learned, however, that Scotland Yard detectives do not consider Monteiro to be a strong suspect and as well trying to gather more clues on the sex attacks on British children, are investigating a gang of at least three burglars who had previously targeted the holiday resort where Maddie was abducted from. Analysis of mobile phone data shows the men were close to the complex at the time she vanished, and were in ‘intense’ phone contact with each other in the following hours. In Portugal, it is claimed that Monteiro’s phone was also near the Ocean Club Resort when Madeleine disappeared. His . widow said she is sure he was not responsible for her disappearance - . and insisted he would have been at home watching TV at the time. The . suspect was wearing a distinctive burgundy long sleeve top, on one of . those occasions it was described as having a white circle on the back. But Ms Rodrigues, 40, said 'I can't remember ever seeing him wear anything like that.' She told the Daily Mirror she met police officers in a cafe near her home in Lagos. 'They . said they suspected him because he used to work at the Ocean Club . complex where the McCanns were staying and because they had tracked the . signal from his mobile phone to the area where Madeleine disappeared the . night she vanished,' she said. 'I was speechless. I kept repeating Euclides was innocent but they said it was not for me to say.' She lives a 15-minute drive away from the scene of the young girl's disappearance on May 3, 2007. Ms . Rodrigues said that she could not remember the night of Madeleine's . disappearance - but insisted she would have turned him in if she thought . he was responsible. She added: 'It's a long time ago, but I'm sure he would have been at home watching TV. That's what he always did after work.' Monteiro, who fathered Ms Rodrigues 11-year-old son, once served a five-year prison sentence for burglary. However, his wife said that although he was 'no angel' he would not have been behind the suspected kidnapping. This . week Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said: 'This is an offender . who has got a very, very unhealthy interest in young, white, female . children whom he is attacking whilst they are on holiday in their beds.' Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann posed two years ago with a picture of how she might now look . Witnesses . describe the man as having dark, tanned skin with short dark unkempt . hair. He spoke in English with a foreign accent, his voice was described . as slow, or possibly slurred. He was sometimes bare chested, some describe him as having a pot belly, and three victims said that he had a noticeable odour. Police . said the suspect may have been in the villa or looking round the villa . for some time before committing the offences or being disturbed either . by a parent, or the child waking up, and said he remained calm, even . when disturbed. On two occasions, they said, the noise of a bin collection lorry could be heard nearby. DCI Redwood said that tracing the man is one of his priority lines of inquiry. He . said: 'We need to establish the identity of this man - these offences . are very serious and no-one has been charged in connection with them.' Mr . Redwood's team currently have 38 people classed as 'persons of . interest' to the inquiry, and are also sifting through details of 530 . known sex offenders whose whereabouts they cannot account for.Of those 59 are classed as high priority, and some of those are British. British . investigators have so far sent three international letters of request . to Portuguese authorities over the investigation, covering 41 priority . areas for the team, involving 287 separate requests. Deputy . Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt showed his anger at the slow pace . of the legal process, saying: 'That's causing us frustration because we . know what we want to do and we are ready to go with that. But the . process is the process.' Another 30 letters have been written to other European countries, but the force would not reveal where. Madeleine, . who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday . apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents . dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. British . detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's . disappearance in July last year - two years into a review of the case - . and made renewed appeals on television in the UK, the Netherlands and . Germany. After . shelving their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance in 2008, . Portuguese authorities said last October that a review had uncovered . enough new information to justify reopening it.","Heroin addict Euclides Monteiro died in a freak tractor accident in 2009 .

"By . Katy Winter . The woman behind the looks that have captivated the world in Beyonce’s latest string of videos has opened up about working with Queen Bey and the tricks she uses to keep Mrs Carter looking on top form. Makeup artist Francesca Tolot, a legend in the industry, met Beyonce in 2003 when she created that sexy 'wet look' for her smash hit Crazy In Love. Since then the two have been near-inseparable professionally. Speaking to Into The Gloss, . Francesca has nothing but praise for the singer, and says that, despite the . her monumental fame, there was no awkwardness when they met. Scroll down for video . Filming 'Partition' for her new album: Francesca says the pair worked closely together to create the looks for each video . The secret to Beyonce's dewy, glowing skin? It's down to baby oil, says her makeup artist . ‘She was very nice; she's a very approachable and warm person. We hit it off from the beginning. Right away I felt very comfortable, and very appreciated, too, because she loved everything we did.’ Francesco reveals that the key to Mrs Carter's incredible glow on stage and camera is in fact just good old baby oil - a huge plus for those who don't have a Beyonce-sized makeup budget. Francesca says the two work closely together to create her looks - opting for a much more pared-down, natural look for many of the videos for her new album. Francesca and Beyonce have worked together for over 10 years, creating some of her most iconic looks and seeing her rise to super stardom . Her hardest task while working for the star was making her look unattractive for a scene in her film Cadillac Records in which she strared as Etta James (pictured) Beyonce's natural beauty means she doesn't need that much make-up, says Francesca . She says: 'There isn't really a look she doesn’t like. She’s very smart—whatever we do is her project. It’s her. 'We stopped using lashes quite a few years ago, except for that look in the ""Blow"" video, when we went for a really ‘70s look. At one point I brought up the fact that I feel that false eyelashes are dated, unless you're going for the retro look. So I talked to her about that, and she totally agreed.’ Gushing about the star, who Francesca travels the world with, she says that Beyonce’s natural beauty means she actually requires very little make-up, and the hardest look she has ever created was making her ugly. ‘Believe it or not, one of the hardest looks to do was for Cadillac Records when she looked so distressed. Can you imagine- somebody with perfect skin, beautiful almond-shaped eyes, very luminous and happy and full of joy—to make her look so bad?’","Francesca Tolot is one of the greats in the make-up industry .

Polk County sheriffs intercepted a 44lb shipment at a truck stop on Tuesday despite the magical soothsayer's insistence that everything was going to be fine that day. The major police victory led to 16 arrests and the dismantling of a drug pipeline that stretched from Mexico through Southern California, Las Vegas, Atlanta and finally Florida. Scroll down for video . Empire: Ma Concepcion  Lopez, left, and Luis Villafuerte Rojas, right, are suspected leaders of the drug ring . Operation Hoodoo Voodoo: Police dubbed a $2M meth mega shakedown in Florida 'Operation Hoodoo Voodoo' after wiretaps revealed the drug ring employed a Voodoo priest for advice and protection . Haul: Weapons and drugs were seized in one of the largest busts carried out in Florida . During the bust more than 100 firearms including assault rifles, a grenade launcher, and bullet proof vests were seized. 'They had everything you can imagine - just all manner of weapons,' sheriff's spokeswoman Donna Woods said. 'It’s about drugs and money and . guns,' Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told BayNews9. 'This is the kind . of firearms that our special agents and our detectives and our deputies . face everyday as we fight this war on drugs.' The 16 arrested were . some of the organization's 25 distributors, couriers and dealers reports . the Orlando Sentinel. The ring's leader Javier 'El Don' Flores, remained at large but Ma Concepcion Lopez, who is alleged to have been the ring's other leader, was arrested. The 38-year-old, who had sneaked back across the border after being deported to Mexico in 2009, was among those in the ring to have allegedly consulted the voodoo priest. Lopez lived with Luis Villafuerte-Rojas, another suspected ring leader who was arrested at a truck stop when the shipment arrived by truck from California. The name and further details about the voodoo consultant have not been released. El Don, who is still on the run, supervised the transcontinental operation from his Southern California home. It's also where he presumably got the advice . from his voodoo priest that led to his organization's undoing. Foresight: The arrests came on the day the group's voodoo priest told them everything was going to be fine . Weapons store: Assault rifles, pistols and a grenade launcher were seized . Risky: Police say the guns that were seized show the dangers officers face in the war on drugs . According to the wire taps, leaders of the ring sought the unnamed voodoo man's counsel in February after $200,000 was seized from the group by investigators. 'They wanted to know if it was OK to continue,' Woods told the Sentinel. 'The priest advised them everything's OK. Just lay low for a couple of weeks. It's not the police. It's someone inside the organization.' The priest was wrong, however, and the continued efforts of police - helped by the misplaced confidence of their targets - allowed for Tuesday's huge haul. Wire taps of the ringleaders, which included conversations with the priest, helped, too. 'We hoodoo the voodoo man,' said Judd, explaining the operation's name. 'The day we served all the search warrants and made all the arrests, he told them ""don’t worry about it, everything is fine"".' Far reaching: The drug ring ran a pipeline of meth from Mexico through Southern California, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Florida . 'Well I agree with the voodoo man, everything is fine. Polk County is safe and there’s a lot of drugs not in central Florida.” When police seiged a Polk County homebase, they found among the firearms AR-15s, AK-47, grenade launcher, bulletproof body armor, and thousands of rounds of ammo. 'Folks, that's more long arms than most police departments have in the U.S.,' DEA Special Agent Mark Trouville told WFTV. Two children were taken from the home, as well. 'They're victims,' said Judd. 'We had to call DCF in order to turn the children over to the state, because all over their relatives were either arrested or implicated in this drug operation.'","Polk County police arrested 16 people and confiscated an unbelievable 44 pounds of uncut meth Tuesday .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A jealous husband stabbed his wife in the neck 19 times with such force part of the blade broke, in an honour killing because he resented her 'Westernised' lifestyle, learning she had been unfaithful. Muslim takeaway delivery driver Jahangir Nazar murdered Farkhanda Younis after flying into an uncontrollable rage when he discovered she had returned home after having sex with one of her lovers. The 35-year-old was today jailed for a minimum of 22 years for killing Ms Younis, 30, known to her friends as Jabeen. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Jahangir Nazar has been jailed for life after he murdered his wife Farkhanda Younis, stabbing her in the neck 19 times . Pictured: Nazar was caught on CCTV filling his car with petrol after he murdered Ms Younis last April . Withdrawal: Nazar is pictured at a cashpoint in his bid to escape the country. He was found with £1,000 on him . Attempts to flee: Police who arrested Nazar in Newcastle, believe he was preparing to flee the country . Nazar had tried to call his wife 25 times, as he laid in wait for her to return to the couple's home in Chadderton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester on April 19 last year. When Ms Younis - described in court as a 'very attractive and flirtatious woman' - arrived home, after meeting a married man for sex to 'celebrate his birthday', Nazar lashed out. Threats: A month before he murdered his wife, Nazar threatened to kill Ms Younis after a row over her lifestyle . During the frenzied attack he stabbed his wife in the neck, while her six-year-old son from a previous marriage slept in his bedroom. Her body was discovered under her duvet after her son rang 999 after failing to rouse his mother, whose body had been locked in the bedroom. At Manchester Crown Court today Pakistan-born Nazar, an illegal immigrant, was found guilty of murder, following a two-week trial. He was jailed for life, and told he will serve at least 22 years behind bars before he is eligible for release. Ms Younis married Nazar in an Islamic ceremony in 2012, . believing their marriage would allow him to stay in the UK. He . worked at a local Indian takeaway while she got a job at a furniture . store and was said to have initially been ‘head over heels’ in love with . her husband. But prosecutor John Jones QC, said . Nazar was a 'possessive, controlling and violent partner' who installed a . tracking app device on his wife’s mobile phone to check her movements . whenever she was out. Mr . Jones said: 'It’s clear that Jabeen and the defendant had entirely . different attitudes to life - it’s clear from others who witnessed the . couple that the defendant was very possessive and very controlling of . Jabeen. 'She was far more . Westernised, outgoing and one has to say, promiscuous in the conduct of . her life, if what other witnesses say about her is correct. 'That is not said in a critical way, . Jabeen was entitled to behave in a way she chose, this is not a court of . morals or a judgement on her lifestyle. Frenzied: Ms Younis, 30, was brutally attacked at the couple's home in Chadderton, near Oldham on April 19 last year . Unfaithful: Manchester Crown Court heard Nazar flew into an uncontrollable rage after his wife returned home from meeting a lover. He attacked the 30-year-old as her son, six, from a previous marriage slept upstairs . 'But, the fact remains that Jabeen lived in every sense an entirely Westernised lifestyle. 'She went to nightclubs, she had many boyfriends, she drank alcohol and she wore Westernised designer clothing. 'It’s . clear she was a very attractive and flirtatious woman. Nazar resented . it and sought to control it, and on the night in question, it led to . uncontrollable rage. 'The end result was a significant attack by a man fearful of deportation, jealous of other men, and resentful of the promiscuity of his girlfriend.' The court heard Ms Younis had been having an affair with a local cab driver who was also married. A month before the murder in April last year, Nazar had threatened to kill Ms Younis after a row over her lifestyle. Carla Cutting, a friend of Ms Younis, told the jury: 'Jabeen was always talking about him and showing pictures of him. 'She was very proud of him and at first seemed head over heels - but their relationship was very stormy. She was talking about splitting up with him but then they would be back together.' Life in prison: Nazar pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but a jury convicted him of Ms Younis's murder. Judge Ingrid Smiler jailed him for life, telling the takeaway delivery driver he would serve at least 22 years behind bars . 'The last time I spoke to Jabeen was on Facebook two days before her death. She said she could not talk because ‘you know who’ was present. 'I can remember one occasion about a month before Jabeen’s death, when I was present when she was speaking to Nazar on her mobile phone. 'The phone was on loudspeaker so I could hear both sides of the conversation, I could hear them arguing - I heard him threaten to give her a slap and then say, ""I will kill you"". 'At the time I just thought this had been said in anger, in the heat of the moment, rather than a genuine threat.' Speaking after the court case a . statement released by Ms Younis's family, said: 'Fand had left the family home . wanting to have more responsibility and manage her own home, at the time . of her murder she was living in Oldham with her two children. 'She was a hard working, devoted mother. Everything she did was for her family and her children. 'Her . husband, Jahangir Nazar has brutally murdered Fand in the most awful . way stabbing her multiple times in the neck causing catastrophic . un-survivable injuries. 'He has carried out this deliberate and unprovoked attack whilst her six-year-old son was asleep in the next room. 'We . believe that the reason Fand was murdered was because she wanted to end . the relationship due to the domestic violence she had been subjected . to. 'She refused to assist Nazar in obtaining a permanent Visa as he was facing the possibility of deportation. 'We . feel that we have been cheated from watching our beautiful daughter . achieve all the things she wanted in life, she lived for her children . and now she will never get to see them grow up and they will not know . who their mother was or how important they were to her.' Another friend, Abdul Majeed, told the court he saw Nazar ‘hit Jabeen in the face very hard’ when he believed she was lying to him about where she had been. Mr Majeed told court that Ms Younis had told him she was going to leave Nazar and had ‘got police involved’. Nazar admitted manslaughter but denied murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by a depressive mental illness. But the court heard after the killing, he disposed of a blood-soaked sock down a drain, withdrew money from a cashpoint and filled up his car with petrol. He was arrested by police at Newcastle train station four days after the killing, carrying a suitcase filled with clothes and £1,000 in cash and was thought to be in the process of fleeing the country. Sentencing Judge Ingrid Smiler said: 'You wanted her to wear a head scarf and did not approve of her style or her new friends or the fact she went to nightclubs and the like. 'Within a short period of time your disapproval of her vivaciousness and zest for life manifested itself in violence which you inflicted by beating, punching and strangling her. 'In addition to this you became jealous, possessive and controlling and tried to prevent her seeing her family and friends. 'You put a tracking app on her phone and hacked into her Facebook account. On a number of occasions in the months leading up to this you threatened to kill her if you discovered she had been unfaithful to you. 'On April 18 you worked a 4pm to 1am shift as a delivery driver. You left early claiming you felt unwell but I am sure you went looking for Jabeen. 'You made unsuccessful calls to her phone. You drove repeatedly around roads near your home. 'You went home to wait for her and she returned with her six-year-old son at 1.30am. 'You waited for her to put him to bed and change out of her clothes and you must then or earlier have got one or more knives taken from the kitchen and gone upstairs where you engaged in a frenzied and ferocious knife attack inflicting 19 wounds - the majority into her neck. 'Such was the force and severity that part of the knife was broken into the neck. 'The knife severed her spinal cord. She can have been in no position to defend herself. 'There is a hole in the family’s lives that can’t be filled. Jabeen was, they say, the life of this large, close family. A part of them has died with her.'","Jahangir Nazar brutally killed his wife to a frenzied attack in April last year .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A convicted bribe-taker in President Barack Obama's political backyard, and at least two other public servants accused of felonies, are seeking office in Tuesday's Illinois Democratic primary elections. Former Chicago city alderman Isaac 'Ike' Carothers spent 28 months in prison for taking bribes, and was released in March 2012. He's running for commissioner of the Cook County board, among the most powerful positions in the Chicago metropolitan area. Carothers followed the family legacy established by his father, who once held the same position before going to prison for official corruption. The younger Carothers accepted a $9,000 bribe, and was accused of committing to accept another $100,000, from a man who wanted help securing government approval to open up at least five restaurants in Chicago's two commercial airports. He also accepted home repairs worth $40,000, plus campaign money and sports tickets, in exchange for fixing a zoning case. Chicago Alderman Isaac 'Ike' Carothers, chairman of the Chicago City Council's police and fire committee, pleaded guilty to corruption charges in 2010, but he's itching to get back into city politics . The Chicago way? Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison 18 corruption convictions, including trying to to auction off President Barack Obama's former U.S. Senate seat . He was also fond of setting aside high-paying summer government jobs for his children and paying them out of specialized slush funds. 'All of us [aldermen] have family members on the payroll,"" the younger Carothers told the Chicago Tribune n 2009. Two other high-profile Democratic politicians with serious corruption problems are on primary ballots in Illinois. State Representative La Shawn K. Ford is running for re-election – unopposed – despite facing a criminal trial on bank fraud charges stemming from his business activities before he ran for office in 2006. He was indicted in late 2012. He has been charged with bank fraud for allegedly lying in 2006 on a $500,000 application for a line of credit. Ford claimed he would use the money to fix up decrepit real estate in Chicago, but prosecutors say he used the money to pay for his personal expenses. Ford is running unopposed in his primary. And Derrick Smith, another Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives, faces a possible 10-year prison sentence in connection with a $7,000 bribe he allegedly accepted from a man who said he wanted a letter of recommendation for a $50,000 grant to open a day care center. It was a set-up, though, orchestrated by a campaign worker who was an FBI informant: The day-care plan never existed. Illinois Reps. La Shawn Ford (L) and Derrick Smith (R) are running for seats in the state legislature despite clouds of corruption, and both are favored to win . Mel Reynolds, a former congressman who went to prison for having sex with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer, ran for the jailed Jesse Jackson Jr.'s old U.S. House seat in 2012 on a campaign theme of 'redemption,' but was beaten handily . The Illinois House expelled Smith in 2012 after criminal charges were laid against him, but months later he won back his seat in a special election. As his trial date looms, he's running again and is favored to win. Democrat Michael Madigan, the powerful Illinois house speaker, is supporting both Smith and Ford. 'We're backing the incumbents,"" Madigan spokesman Steve Brown told Reuters, saying both men are innocent until proven guilty in court. 'That's how America works,' Brown said. An aide to an Illinois Republican congressman told MailOnline on Tuesday that the GOP won't likely reap political benefits from Democrats' lapses. 'I wish we could take advantage,' he said, requesting anonymity, 'but Illinois is a blue state and a universe unto itself. It would be easier for us to land on the sun than to get a Republican elected to those seats.' 'And when you have sitting politicians scratching each others' backs within their own political machine, it's hard to throw the bums out.' George Ryan, the corrupt former Illinois governor, spent five years in prison for official corruption before his release in 2013 . Not every Democrat in positions of power is helping the ethically challenged candidates, however. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is urging voters to shy away from Ike Carothers. But the convict is hoping for a clean slate. 'I believe in a God that believes in second . chances,' Carothers told a television audience in December. 'And I hope that the voters in this [Chicago] district will give me a . second chance.'. The situation in Illinois is 'a terrible indictment' of the local political culture, added former Chicago Alderman Dick Simpson, now a University of Illinois at Chicago professor. 'There is still a patronage-based political army on the West Side of Chicago.' Illinois politicians are famous for playing fast and loose with the public's trust: U.S. Justice Department statistics rank Chicago as the nation's most corrupt city. Since 1976 there have been 1,531 public corruption convictions in that one city, and the problem extends to the state capital of Springfield. Former Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich is serving a 14-year prison sentence for political corruption after he was convicted of trying to sell an appointment to the U.S. Senate after Barack Obama assumed the presidency. Blagojevich replaced Republican Gov. George Ryan, who spent five years in federal prison for racketeering. The exception that proves the rule? President Barack Obama doesn't appear tainted by the smarmy politics in his home town, but ethical challenges of a different kind are dogging him in his second term . Ryan's crime involved taking bribes from unqualified truck drivers in exchange for providing them with hauling licenses while he was Illinois Secretary of State. Expanding Illinois' smarmy legacy, Jesse Jackson Jr., a former state representative and son of the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson Sr., pleaded guilty last month to misusing $750,000 in campaign funds to fund his and his wife's lavish lifestyles. The younger Jackson's purchases included a $43,350 gold Rolex watch. He will be sentenced later this year. Former Illinois Congressman Mel Reynolds' corruption chronicles, however, may be the state's most colorful and disturbing. Reynolds went to prison in the 1990s for the statutory rape of a 16-year-old campaign volunteer, and for bank fraud. He was arrested in Zimbabwe in Feburary after allegedly making 100 pornographic films and taking 2,000 naked pictures in hotels. Mere possession of pornography is a crime in that African nation. But a judge dismissed the charges weeks later and deported him, back to Illinois.","A former Chicago alderman left prison in 2012 after serving 28 months for bribery and tax fraud, and is running for Cook County commissioner .

"By . James  Nye . Arrest: Candace Patricia Hauser has been arrested for animal cruelty after allegedly performing a c-section on a friends dog who later died after she used glue to patch up the animals wound . Authorities in Tampa have arrested a 31-year-old woman is facing five-years in prison for animal cruelty charges after she allegedly performed a c-section on a dog with a 'steak knife', no anesthesia and then used glue to close the amateur incision. The Mastiff called Nadia died soon after and now Candace Patricia Hauser is facing a felony charge for removing the last two of the dogs 13 puppies on March 4 even though there was a veterinarian nearby. Investigators arrested Hauser on March 5 when the dog's owner brought her to Veterinary Healthcare Associates in Winter Haven telling them she believed the animal was dying - when in fact Nadia was already dead. Police believe the dog's owner, Brenda Hines of Winter Haven, rushed her pregnant mastiff to Hauser's home on March 4 for help delivering her dogs. The dog got into difficulties during the delivery and Hauser, who does not have any veterinary or medical qualifications began to perform a c-section on the dog - in a desperate effort to save the puppies and dog. Hillsborough County Code Enforcement Department director Ron Spiller said that upon examination the wound on the dog appeared to be 'jagged'. Investigators believe this indicates that a surgical instrument such as a scalpel was not used - rather that she used 'some type of sharp serrated knife'. Death: The owner brought brought the dog to Veterinary Healthcare Associates in Winter Haven telling them she believed the dog was dying . When it was put to him that the most available knives in a household would come from the kitchen such as a steak knife, Spiller replied it was a fair assessment that is what Hauser used to perform her grizzly home surgery. As far as why Hauser assumed she could perform such as complicated operation, Spiller said that his department had been told that she had previously worked in a Florida medical examiners office - giving her first hand experience of working with surgical instruments. Spiller said that Hauser had intervened manually when the dog fell into difficulties delivering her puppies. 'Hauser removed nine of the dogs manually, but the last two she could not get,' said Spiller. 'That was when she decided upon the c-section.' According to the arrest affidavit, Nadia passed away in the car on the way back to Hines' home after delivering her 11 puppies. However, 12-hours later on March 5, Hines brought the dog to Veterinary Healthcare Associates in Winter Haven telling them she believed the dog was dying. Arrest: Candace with her son and husband (right) is facing a possible jail term for her performing the surgery on the dog . But investigators said at that point, the veterinarian told her that Nadia was dead. A Polk County veterinary hospital notified the Polk County Sheriff's Office about the incident. Investigators with PCSO in turn contacted Hillsborough County Animal Safety and Enforcement. Ron Spiller, told Bay News 9, 'This case is one that makes your skin crawl.' 'To cut a dog open with no anesthesia. Oh my gosh. I have a 30-year law enforcement career and the circumstances in this case makes my skin crawl.' Neither Hauser nor her attorney had any comment on Tuesday after her arrest on Saturday. Hauser was booked in jail Saturday and released on $2,000 bail. Of the 11 puppies delivered 10 survived and one died and they are currently with Hines. Mastiff: Nadia the mastiff (not pictured here) died after delivering her puppies on March 4 in Tampa .","Candace Patricia Hauser is facing felony charges for animal cruelty after allegedly performing a c-section on her friend's dog .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . The former New York University professor accused of stalking and harassing her ex-lover, chief Citigroup economist Willem Buiter, appeared in court on Thursday morning. Heleen Mees, 44, a Dutch economist and educator, was arrested in July 2013 and accused of sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and threatening emails and Facebook messages. Buiter, a 63-year-old married father of two, was admonished by a judge in August 2013 for contacting his alleged stalker by LinkedIn and Skype in the month after she was arrested. But Mees attended a hearing in New York today where her request for dismissal was denied and her case will now proceed to trial. Charged: Alleged stalker Heleen Mees appears in court for a hearing in New York on Thursday. Mees has been accused of harassing Citigroup executive Willem Buiter . Exit: Mees leaves the courthouse after the hearing in New York. Her request for dismissal was denied and her case will now proceed to trial . Citigroup economist: Married father of two Willem Buiter claims he was threatened by Mees . Mees's attorneys are arguing that her communication with Buiter was just an ordinary part of their relationship. In August 2013 Buiter was ‘admonished' by Judge Joanne Quinones because he sent an ‘invitation to connect’ to Mees via business networking website LinkedIn. He had also contacted her on Skype just weeks before she was charged with allegedly sending him thousands of messages. The full extent of Mees’ alleged stalking was revealed in court papers which showed she followed him to China and Amsterdam, where she used a fake name to try and get into his hotel. Defense: Dutch economist Heleen Mees (right) appears with her lawyer Ira London (left) at the hearing. Mees's attorneys are arguing that her communication with Buiter was just an ordinary part of their relationship . Accused: Mees leaves the courthouse after Thursday's hearing . She also sent Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, a message which read: ‘I hope you die (read this to your wife)’. Prosecutors say that her obsessive behavior lasted between 2009 and July 2013. Some of the emails were sexual, such as a request to 'also send him naked pictures of other women'. But others were more disturbing such as a picture of some dead birds next to which she wrote: 'I hope your plane falls out the sky.' In the criminal complaint against her Buiter said: ‘In May 2010, the defendant tried to meet with me at my hotel in Beijing, China, and in January 2013, the defendant tried to meet me at my hotel in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, by using a fake name. ‘On May 6, 2013, the defendant came to my apartment building in the County and State of New York, and tried to be let up to my apartment.’ In August 2013, Mees’ lawyer Ira London told a court that the reality was in fact very different. Contact: Buiter was 'admonished' by a judge in August 2013 because he sent an 'invitation to connect' to Mees via business networking website LinkedIn a month after she had been arrested . He said that the affair was ‘encouraged on social media and in person' as well by Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, who was born in Holland but has British citizenship. Buiter sent Mees a cease and desist letter on February 27 but Mr London said that on June 19 he contacted his client on Skype. Threatened: Mees allegedly sent harassing messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), and the couple's two children . Buiter disconnected his alleged stalker as a contact on Skype on June 23 but three days later he reconnected her. Mr . London told the court that this behavior ‘only served to illustrate . that this was a bilateral relationship and not harassment'. Mees . was arrested on July 1 when the first criminal complaint was filed. Among the allegations was that she harassed Mr Buiter's children from . his first marriage, David, 22, and Elizabeth, 19. An . amended complaint was sent on August 5 removing the allegation that Mr . Buiter's children were harassed. The message to Mees from Mr Buiter via . LinkedIn was sent two days later. It is not clear if he sent it or the message was automated but Judge Quinones made it clear that regardless she was unimpressed. Judge . Quinones told the prosecutor: 'The People will admonish the complainant . witness (Mr Buiter) that he is not to contact this defendant in any . way'. During a testy . exchange she raised her voice to Mees to ask that she understood she was . to have 'absolutely no contact' with Mr Buiter and his wife under the . terms of a protection order. She demurely replied: 'Yes'. Willem Buiter has chaired the World . Economic Forum and was on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy . Committee. In 2010, he was hired as Citigroup's chief economist. Over . the past three decades, Buiter had taught economics at some of the . world's most prestigious institutions, including Princeton, Yale and . Cambridge universities. High flyer: Mees, who is fluent in five languages, including Mandarin and French, was assistant professor in economics at Tilburg University and a researcher at the Erasmus School of Economics in the Netherlands . Buiter, a native of the Netherlands, is . married to economics professor Anne Sibert, and the couple have a . 22-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter . Among . the other allegations against Mees is that she targeted Sibert, a . professor at the University of London’s Birkbeck college. Buiter . said in the criminal complaint: ‘The defendant's actions have caused me . severe annoyance and alarm, and to fear for my physical safety and for . the safety of my wife and my children.’ Mees, who is fluent in five languages, including Mandarin and French, was assistant professor in economics at Tilburg University and a researcher at the Erasmus School of Economics in the Netherlands. Her area of expertise is monetary policy and emerging economies. It is believed that the brilliant economist and vocal advocate for the advancement of women in the workplace has become obsessed with her distinguished lover.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It could be a scene out of a 1950s horror film - an unstoppable 'ice tsunami' gradually moving ashore, destroying everything in its path. But this footage actually shows the weather phenomenon known as ice floe in action in Minnesota, north America, over the weekend. Strong winds are responsible for pushing this sheet of ice off the top of Lake Mille Lacs and up over the shoreline right up to resident's doorsteps. Creepy: Darla Johnson uploaded this footage of a sheet of ice rising out of Milles Lacs Lake towards her home in Izatys Resort, Minnesota . Winter weather: The ice flow phenomenon is caused by strong winds driving the ice ashore . And this footage filmed by a homeowner shows the eerie ice shards slowly covering ground before eventually creeping into people's home. Youtube user Darla Johnson uploaded the footage of ice rising out of Milles Lacs Lake and into the townhomes of Izatys Resort on May 11. The panic-stricken mother can be heard warning her son not to go near the ice while watching it getting closer and closer to her own home. Ms Johnson says: 'Look at it. It's crawling up. It's just pushing and pushing and pushing. Unstoppable: The ice reached front doors and windows, even entering some resident' homes . Dangerous: Winds reached up to 40 miles per hours to push the ice sheets ashore in Minnesota . 'Its gone through their door. Their door's in. It's going right through their house.' WCCO-TV reports that the ice from reached the doors and windows at the Izatys Resort on Saturday morning. But the video posted on Liveleek.com suggests it entered some homes. National Weather Service Meteorologist Shawn Devinny says 30 to 40 mile an hour winds pushed the water into the ice, driving it ashore. The Department of Natural Resources says about 10 miles of shoreline are covered, with some reaching up to 30 feet high. Taking over: The 'ice tsunami' creeps towards garden furniture which is hastily moved by the homeowner who filmed these bizarre scenes . Thick covering: Around 10 miles of shoreline were left covered with the ice sheet which was 30 feet high at points . It comes as massive ice floes rose out of a lake 600 miles north in Canada over the . weekend, destroying a dozen homes and damaging fifteen others. Within mere moments, strong winds drove piles of ice onto . the shore from Dauphin Lake on Friday, inundating homes and giving . residents only minutes to flee. 55-mile-per hour winds drove masses of ice from the thawing lake in a phenomenon that is commonly witnessed but rarely seen with such intensity and size. Dwarfed: Winds forced massive walls of ice onto the shores of Lake Dauphin, dwarfing homes in rural Manitoba, Canada on Friday . Unusual: A dozen homes were destroyed and many others left uninhabitable after winds piled ice onto Ochre Beach Friday in an unusually large ice flow . By Friday night, a state of emergency had been declared in . the town of Ochre River, a 188 miles northwest of Winnipeg. Authorities told the Winnipeg Free Press that seven of the . destroyed homes were ‘literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes . from Lake Dauphin.’ Twenty-seven homes were affected in total as the frozen wall to plowed through everything in its way . along Ochre Beach. Though the moving ice was as tall as a house in places, no . injuries have been reported. Terrifying: Homeowners had only minutes to flee as the mounting ice entered their doors and windows . Nonetheless, residents were still shaken Saturday. Even some of those whose houses remained standing were . allowed inside only to collect their belongings after authorities declared many . of the seemingly spared dwellings to be structurally unfit to inhabit. One family told the Free Press the ice easily topped and pushed . into their two-story home, shuffled moved furniture around, and ‘pushed the . bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway.’ ‘They heard it before they saw it coming up their decks,’ Ochre . River deputy Reeve Clayton Watts told the Free Press Saturday. ‘Then, it came . right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no . one was hurt. We were very lucky.’ Unlucky: The affected town Ochre River, 188 miles outside Winnipeg, had only recently begun to recover from severe floods in 2011 . Help: Hundreds of volunteers showed up Saturday to help dig Ochre Beach out of the massive ice floe . The town, still reeling from a severe 2011 flood that . destroyed many homes, was somber but not helpless. Watts was one hand for Saturday’s clean-up efforts, which saw . friends and neighbors come together to get the community back on its feet. Hundreds of volunteers were on hand with shovels, wheel . barrows, and even bulldozers to dig the town out. ‘Everybody was pitching in to help them make it through the . day,’ Watts said. ‘It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just . helps out.’ Severe: Many of the 27 affected homes were not destroyed, but still deemed uninhabitable . Again: Some of the leveled homes were brand new, having just been rebuilt in the wake of severe 2011 flooding . Homeless: Canadian officials were at work Saturday helping the community dig out of the ice and to find shelter for those left homeless by the floe .","Sheet of ice covering Lake Mille Lacs in Minnesota moved ashore into homes .

"By . Associated Press . An Indian diplomat accused of lying about how much she paid her housekeeper was indicted on Thursday on two criminal charges, though prosecutors told a judge that she had been granted diplomatic immunity and left the country earlier in the day. Devyani Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered an outcry in India. She's accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper. The indictment said Khobragade had made or multiple false representations to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker. Devyani Khobragade was charged with visa fraud and making false statements. She faces prosecution if she returns to the States and has expressed her fear that she may never live with her husband and two daughters - who remain in New York - as family again. She planned to bring the worker to the . United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General . of India in New York, according to the indictment. Khobragade, . 39, India's deputy consul general in New York, has maintained her . innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 . per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage. Her . arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she . was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants . before being released on $250,000 bail. In . a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an . arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic . immunity status and left the United States on Thursday. The . letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to . court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return . to the U.S. without immunity status. 'We . will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to . the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the . government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in . the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet . Bharara said. However Khobragade's lawyer said today that she is still in the U.S., despite a prosecutor's claim that she left. Attorney Daniel Arshack said in a statement on Thursday that his client was at her New York City apartment. Shortly after he issued the statement, a spokesman for federal prosecutors said the State Department had told prosecutors that it had asked her to leave the country on Thursday afternoon. Devyani Khobragade was arrested last . month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her . housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour . In an . unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to . what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case . by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying . to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a . housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was . contracted to work. He also . questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment . of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about . the alleged treatment of Khobragade. He . said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect . victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal . status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'. These . developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on . behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions. Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York .

Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in . July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, . a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani . Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions . or keeping a person in bondage.' The . petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family . several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire . consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get . them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr . Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in . front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of . what the woman took. Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also . wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and . wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, . because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on . foreign soil'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The South Carolina woman who drove into the sea in an alleged attempt to kill her three children also tried to harm her unborn child, a court in Florida heard. Ebony Wilkerson, who is 28 weeks pregnant, was seen ‘beating her stomach with her fists’ after her arrest. The 32-year-old was taken to a psychiatric ward where she has been kept for observation after being sectioned under the Baker Act. Scroll down for video . 'Dangerous': Pregnant Ebony Wilkerson, seen at her bail hearing on Monday March 17, allegedly 'punched her stomach with her fists' after her arrest . Details of the latest violence came at a bond hearing for Wilkerson. She has been charged with attempted murder after driving her minivan into the ocean at Daytona Beach, Florida. Her three children, aged three, nine and 10, were rescued by witnesses and lifeguards. Authorities said Wilkerson, who had driven from her home in South Carolina, deliberately drove into the ocean while her three kids were strapped inside. Details of her attempt to harm her unborn child came from State Attorney R.J. Larizza who said Wilkerson was taken to a psychiatric ward when she was seen ‘beating her stomach with her fists’ after her arrest. Under arrest: Ebony Wilkerson, 32, charged with three counts of first-degree attempted murder and three counts of aggravated child abuse after driving her children into the ocean off a Florida beach . He told a court her unborn child was at risk saying she was ‘helpless’. Chief Assistant Public Defender Craig S. Dyer suggested Wilkerson's actions resulted from inhumane conditions. He said at the time she was being held naked in an isolation cell. Dyer argued that Wilkerson should have her $1.2m bond suspended and she should be admitted to Halifax Health for care. ‘I believe that Mrs. Wilkerson can be helped,’ said Dr. James Moore, a psychiatrist. He described Wilkerson's detention as so restrictive that it will complicate mental health treatment. ‘She's limited in her ability even for such things as getting fresh air,’ The judge also heard from Dr. Pamela Carbiener, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist, who said Wilkerson's pregnancy is complicated by several factors and she has risk factors for premature birth. ‘I think she has significant high-risk issues,’ Carbiener said. Judge Leah Case declined to release Wilkerson to the hospital. Unstable: The pregnant South Carolina woman who drove the minivan carrying her three young children into the ocean surf had talked about demons before leaving the house .

According to the Orlando Sentinel, she set a March 25 follow-up hearing, inviting the defense to provide case law supporting its proposal. Wilkerson's family has said she drove into the water days after leaving her husband, following 14 years of abuse in South Carolina. Her children have told investigators she had been behaving erratically since arriving in Florida. Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that Wilkerson was physically able to escape the vehicle. In video taken by Simon Besner, a . tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards . try to pull her children from the vehicle. Witnesses . described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children . remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her . under the van. 'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner. Never again: Doug Krane never thought he'd hear Wilkerson's name again after his wife's death - then she allegedly tried to kill her children . Survivor: Krane's infant son survived the crash that claimed the life of his young mother . Krane says last week's incident could have been prevented if Wilkerson had been held responsible for the wreck that killed his wife . In the video, several men frantically . try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's . side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan. The small child is eventually pulled to safety. Another tourist described watching with horror. 'My . friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the . beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin . visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6. 'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.' 'That's . when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out . two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and . brought a little toddler out of the car'. Many added that there was no way the incident was an accident. Leonard . R. Ross, an attorney representing Wilkerson's husband, Lutful Ronjon, . released the following statement late Monday: ‘My client continues to . pray for his wife's wellbeing and sincerely hopes that mental health . professionals will address her issues.’ Last week is was revealed that Wilkerson had been involved in a car crash that claimed a woman's life in 2007. Evidence: Ebony Wilkerson's car (right) can be seen veering from the sand toward the ocean . Police say Wilkerson, who is pregnant, locked the doors of her 2012 Honda Odyssey, put up the windows and told her three frightened children - ages 3, 9 and 10 - to close their eyes and go to sleep as she drove into the ocean . Despite the grainy quality, the video shows the moment Wilkerson stops her car in the waves . Rescue: The dramatic moment the children were plucked to safety was filmed by Simon Besner . Race against time: The rescuers managed to grab all the children from the car as it was submerged in the surf . Jennifer . Krane, had just given birth when she and husband Dough were slammed . into by Ebony Wilkerson on a freeway near Fort Lauderdale. On . the day of the deadly wreck, Wilkerson was going northbound on Interstate . 95 when she switched lanes and slammed into the rear of a Nissan . operated by Doug Krane, who was driving with his wife and infant son in the car. The . impact sent Krane's car skidding across the road and into a concrete . barrier. Jennifer Krane suffered critical injuries in the collision and . died several days later.

"By . Will Payne In Maryville, Missouri . and Daily Mail Reporters . The high school football player accused of raping 14-year-old Daisy Coleman pleaded guilty to child endangerment today but was not charged with any sexual offenses after the teen and her family accepted his apology. Matthew Barnett, 19, was given a two-year . suspended sentence in Maryville, Missouri after entering a plea bargain that required him merely to apologize and pay $1,800 towards Coleman's . future counseling. Coleman, who has tried to commit suicide three times since the alleged attack in 2012, said she believed Barnett's apology was 'genuine', Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said. 'Today I am grateful… I am ready to . move forward,' Coleman, now 16, said in a statement. 'To all of those who . supported me, I promise what happened on January 8 of 2012 will not . define me forever.' In court: Matthew Barnett, who was accused of raping a fellow student, walks to the courthouse with his legal counsel J.R. Hobbs in Maryville, Missouri on Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to child endangerment . Free man: Barnett was given a suspended sentence and was required to apologize to Daisy Coleman . Her mother Melinda, who has been . incredibly outspoken since the January 2012 incident, added in her own . statement: 'I hope that today’s resolution of this criminal case brings . some closure for my family, especially my children, and for the . community.' It is an . astonishing turn-around from just days ago when Melinda launched a . scathing attack on the investigation following her daughter’s suicide . attempt. She added to CBS News that, although she was disappointed a sexual assault charge was not filed against Barnett, she was appreciative of the work Prosecutor Baker did. 'I think she had a really tough task and I think she did the very best she could do with it,' she said. 'Considering all the evidence that had been lost, destroyed, tampered with or returned… There wasn’t a lot she could do.' The child endangerment . charge, which was only brought to the court on Thursday morning, stems . from leaving Daisy outside her house in the snow following the alleged . attack. Barnett was not charged with a felony after prosecutors said on Thursday that there was insufficient evidence to support sex assault charges. It . was also revealed all charges against 19-year-old Barnett’s co-accused . Jordan Zech have been dropped, effectively bringing an end to the saga. Thursday's . court proceedings and the Coleman’s acceptance of the sentence will . come as a surprise to the millions of people around the world who have . followed the explosive story. Accused: Matt Barnett, 19, left, pleaded guilty to a child endangerment charge on Thursday, two years after he was first accused of raping Daisy Coleman, right, then 14, at a house party . Speaking out: Defense attorney J.R. Hobbs talks to the press after defendant Matthew Barnett pleaded guilty to child endangerment at the Nodaway County Courthouse in Marysville, Missouri on Thursday . Limited charges: Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker talks to the press after he pleaded guilty. There was not enough evidence to charge him with sexual assault, prosecutors said . Coleman had claimed that Barnett raped her at a January 2012 house party, when . he was a Maryville High School senior and she was a freshman. Barnett . says the sex was consensual. The case received national . attention after fellow students relentlessly bullied the alleged victim . for reporting the attack - eventually forcing her family to flee the . small town. The family home then mysteriously . burned down. But Prosecutor Baker was insistent that Thursday's outcome is the right outcome. She . said there was insufficient evidence for any kind of sexual assault . felony charge, which is what Daisy and Melinda were pushing for from the . outset. Baker . said: 'Legally we could not get that over the bar. I could not file . that charge.' She added if the evidence had existed to allow her to file . a felony sex charge, 'I would have done it'. 'It . is not the job of the prosecutor to seek convictions. It is the job of . the prosecutor to seek justice. I believe this is the right outcome, . given the evidence available in the case. This is justice.' The . plea, Barnett’s attorney JR Hobbs said outside of the Nodaway County . courthouse, 'accurately reflects the conduct for which he should be held . accountable. Mr. Barnett truly regrets the actions to which he pleads . guilty.' A different story: Barnett (left) has claimed from the beginning that he had consensual sex with Coleman (right) at the party that night. He said he was aware that the teenager had been drinking . Seeking justice: Supporters pass out flowers in Maryville before a rally for Daisy last October . The . announcement of the lesser charge of endangerment comes only days after . Ms Coleman made a third attempt on her life - this one resulting in . possible brain damage. She is currently being held in the psych ward of a Kansas City Hospital. Hours . before she attempted to take her life, she wrote a tweet on Sunday . hinting at the emotional toll the ordeal has taken on her. 'Don’t give up they say,' she wrote. 'You’re so strong they say. But none of you even know me.' And, . in yet another bizarre twist, mutilated rabbits were stuffed inside a . car belonging to another girl who was sexually assaulted that night. The . sick act came just hours after Coleman attempted suicide. The . charges stemmed from an incident on January 8, 2012 when Barnett and . some other boys picked up Daisy and Paige Parkhurst, then-13-years-old, . from Daisy's house and took them to the home of one of the boys. The two . girls sneaked out of Ms Coleman's home to attend the party. Burned to the ground: Theses scorched ruins are all that remains of the Coleman's Maryville home after it burned down last year - the fire's cause has yet to be determined . Daisy claimed that when she got to the party she was given a clear liquid that she drank before being taken into a bedroom and raped while a second boy recorded the act on his cellphone. Daisy said she blacked out and doesn't . remember much after arriving at the boy's home. Melinda Coleman has . said she believes her daughter was given a date-rape drug. Mr Barnett admitted the two had sex and that he was aware Ms Coleman had been drinking, but has steadfastly insisted the sex was consensual. Jordan Zech, 17, was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor for filming the encounter. Ms . Parkhurst was taken into a different room by a 15-year-old boy who . forced her to have sex, which he has admitted to doing. His case was . handled in the juvenile system and is not public record. Melinda Coleman said she . awoke around 5 a.m. to a clawing sound at her front door and found her . daughter shivering in sub-freezing temperatures. She said she was giving . Daisy a bath to warm her up when she noticed signs that she had been . assaulted. Daisy was . then subjected to relentless bullying online and in school. It became . so bad she has tried committing suicide multiple times. Grisly: The family of Paige Parkhurst (right) found dead rabbits (left) in their car this week. Parkhurst was raped by a 15-year-old on the night of the party and the boy, a juvenile, admitted to the crime . High school horror: Instead of advocating for her, Daisy Coleman claims her classmates turned on and relentlessly bullied her . The family then fled Maryville for their hometown of New Albany. Their Maryville house soon mysteriously burned to the ground. Investigators have yet to determine a cause for the fire. The case shook the small college town of Maryville, which was deluged with negative reactions after The Kansas City Star published a seven-month investigation into claims made by the Colemans. Many people condemned the town on social media - and continue to do so - for seemingly abandoning sexual assault victims. The outcry led to a protest on Maryville's courthouse square in which a few hundred people showed up to show their support for Daisy and lambaste what they labeled as a 'rape culture' that allowed the girl's assailant to go unpunished.","Matt Barnett, 19, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor child endangerment charge 2 years after he was accused of raping Daisy Coleman at a party .

'All my friends were married and had . children, and I hadn't, and I just wanted to feel what that was all . about,' she explained. 'So I guess when the first guy came along, when I was 21-ish, I . just said ""yes, it's great, he's interested in me"" and off I went. 'Of course, I have my boy, my son, but [he] was the only thing that . was genuine [in that relationship].'

"By . Meghan Keneally . A former cop-turned-disability schemer has been revealed to have been renting a $1.5million Florida mansion using the money he was given from Social Security. Glenn Lieberman, 48, was held up by the New York District Attorney as one of the poster boys for the widespread scam when it was announced on Tuesday and now details of how he spent the $175,000 he pocketed have been revealed. The former New York police officer and his wife moved from New York to the warmer climes of Palm Beach, Florida and are currently renting a waterfront mansion that has a pool and access to a waterway where he parks his two jet skis. Lieberman was seen turning himself in to . Manhattan authorities today at around 8.3am after being allowed to drive . himself up to New York, and could spend up to 15 years behind bars for . his part in the scheme. Scroll Down for Video . Sending a message: Glenn Lieberman is pictured on a jet ski, clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing . Life of luxury: Lieberman's Palm Beach home had an on-site pool and access to water where he docked his two jet skis . The District Attorney introduced the public to Lieberman by showing a picture of the father-of-two on a jet ski sticking up both of his middle fingers while smiling at the camera. Aside from painting an unflattering portrait of Lieberman, it also directly contradicts his claims that he suffered from 'depression and panic attacks' after working at Ground Zero following the terrorist attacks. A former colleague told The New York Post that his illnesses weren't the only false part of his story- as they said he never even worked at the site. There were 102 people who were indicted as recipients in the fraudulent benefits scheme, and Lieberman is one of 82 of those people who used to work as a cop, fire fighter or corrections officer. Some of the accused had been falsely claiming disability funds since the 1980s- with the help of four administrative ringleaders- while others only started after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Many were coached about how they could appear depressed or in the throes of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is not known what exactly Lieberman claimed to have, but he started collecting payments in 2009 and has since brought in a total of $175,000. 'When he told me he was a retired . police officer and I saw how he was living, I told my husband that . something didn’t add up,' neighbor Cheryl Weinstock told The New York . Daily News. Ms Weinstock . said that she has not seen his Jeep in the Lieberman's driveway but his . wife Mirla Sanchez's car and their dog, SoHo, are still in Palm Beach. Not so afraid of crowds now: Joseph Morrone, who said his post-9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working, collected $108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed San Gennaro festival . Busted: Mike Scialabba (left) collected $232,443 . from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot . and Louis Hurtado (right) worked as a martial arts instructor while . collecting $470,395 from Social Security . Active: Rich Cosentino collected a total of $207639 since May 2008 . Lieberman did work on the force for 19 years as part of the Brooklyn South Gangs officer, and it is not clear if he had picked up a secondary job since moving to Florida. If he did, that would disqualify him from receiving disability payments. That is how a number of the other fraudsters were caught, and the District Attorney told how some were working as helicopter pilots and martial arts instructors- activities that blatantly went against their disability claims. The officers were not the only ones in on the scheme, as The Post reports that some of the accused' siblings pulled the same move. Vincent LaMantia is one of the 102 indicted fraudsters, and his siblings Darrin, Karen and Thomas all told officials that they had psychiatric ailments that made it impossible for them to hold down a job. All told, the Staten Island siblings collected $596,000- with the largest portion- $287,000- going to Thomas as he began making disability claims in 2002. Vincent, 43, collected $148,000 and the remaining $161,000 was split between Karen, Kevin and Darrin. Many of the fraudsters left a virtual trail, including Vincent LaMantia who posted a motivational video online (which has now been removed) where he talked about ways to get rich quick. Another such example was that of Joseph Morrone, who told authorities that his work after the September 11th attacks left him with a debilitating fear of crowds. Not hurting too badly: John Famularo, 58, lives in Nassau, New York and his alleged disabilities- which have not been specifically disclosed- should have prevented him from motorcycling but he proudly posted this to Facebook . Throwback: Famularo had no qualms about posting this old picture of him in uniform online, and he was far from the only 'boy in blue' that was involved in the scheme . On Facebook, he was pictured selling cannolis at the crowded San Gennaro festival in Little Italy. The suspicion is that there were a handful of 'crooked' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders in question and were fully aware of how to 'game the system'. The four alleged 'ringleaders' were identified first, and it is clear that their positions within the NYPD and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years. Participants would start out by contacting John Minerva, 61, a Detectives Endowment Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito, 64, a retired member of the NYPD. Minerva or Esposito would then refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme- Thomas Hale, 89, and former FBI agent Raymond Lavallee, 83. All four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny. The 9/11 disability claims are not the first that the four men have had a hand in, as ABC reports that they are believed to have been running disability scams since 1988. The lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors- but not after some coaching. The district attorney laid out a series of different trigger phrases that would help justify an anxiety condition prescription. Tag team: John Minerva (left), a Detectives . Endowment Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito (right), a retired . member of the NYPD, would refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who . were in on the scheme . Law on their side: Raymond Lavallee, 83, was one of those two lawyers who then helped process the legal papers which allowed the schemers to get on average between $30,000 and $50,000 per year- with a nice cut for each of the ringleaders . They range from 'I nap on and off during the day' to 'my (family member) is always after me about my grooming'. Other possible additions included the lamentation that they were 'healthy, active, productive' people but no longer. 'They're liable to say... spell the word ""world,"" so you go ""W-R-L-D."" Then they're gonna say ""Spell it backwards."" You think about it, and you can't spell it backwards,""' court papers report that Esposito said in a recording. All told, the fraudulent claims cost $24.5million in taxpayer-funded benefits. 'For years, federal taxpayers have unwittingly financed the lifestyles of the defendants charged today,' district attorney Cy Vance said in a statement which listed all of the 106 accused. 'Many participants cynically manufactured claims of mental illness as a result of September 11th, dishonoring the first responders who did serve their City at the expense of their own health and safety. This alleged scam further depleted the already limited resources available for battling the real and complex conditions of PTSD and depression.'","Glenn Lieberman, 48, took home $175,000 since 2009 and was living in Palm Beach at his rented $1.5million home .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Oscar Pistorius looked at porn and car websites the night before he shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, it emerged in court today. The double-amputee athlete searched a porn website and later looked at cars including an Aston Martin Rapide R in the early evening on February 13, 2013. His internet search history was revealed as a ballistics experts told the High Court in Pretoria how Ms Steenkamp, 29, was standing in a toilet cubicle facing the closed door when Pistorius opened fire the following night on February 14. Captain Christiaan Mangena told . Pretoria's High Court that Reeva Steenkamp was struck in the hip by the first bullet and then fell back on to a . magazine holder by the toilet before she was hit by a further two . bullets. One bullet fired from the 9mm pistol struck her in the right arm and while another penetrated her skull as she crossed her arms over her head to protect herself, Captain Mangena said. Scroll down for video . Not listening: Oscar Pistorius appeared to place his thumbs in his ears as ballistic evidence about his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp's gunshot wounds are described to the court yesterday . Distressed: Pistorius wipes his eyes as ballistics expert Captain Christiaan Mangena tell his murder trial how Steenkamp was shot in the hip, arm and head . Emotional: Pistorius appears to grimace as further details of the night he shot his girlfriend are told to the court . As Mangena threw his hands up to . cover his head in court and replicate the 'defensive position' he said . Steenkamp took as the last shots were fired, Pistorius put his fingers . in his ears in an apparent attempt to block out the testimony. June . Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, also was in the courtroom and occasionally . glanced at photos of the bloody scene of her daughter's shooting before . looking away. Mr Mangena also testified that he believed the second bullet fired missed Ms Steenkamp . and ricocheted off a wall inside the cubicle and broke into fragments, . which caused bruising on her back. Mr . Mangena concluded, through his analysis of the shooting scene and . wounds on Ms Steenkamp's body from post-mortem photos, that one bullet . went through Ms Steenkamp's left hand before penetrating her skull as . she held it over her head. The policeman said he could not determine the order of the last two shots. Pistorius, . 27, is charged with premeditated murder over Ms Steenkamp's death on . February 14 last year and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. Family support: Pistorius hugs his sister Aimee (pictured right) during his trial at the High Court in Pretoria . New details: The court heard how the first shot fired by Pistorius broke Ms Steenkamp's hip bone, causing her to fall back on to a magazine rack near the bathroom toilet . Gunshots: While Ms Steenkamp was collapsed on the magazine rack, Pistorius fired a further three shots through the bathroom door, one of which struck her arm while the other hit her in the head . Alone: Pistorius sits in the dock on the 13th day of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria . He . says he shot Ms Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his . bathroom because he thought she was a dangerous night-time intruder in . his home. Pistorius . says Ms Steenkamp went to use the toilet during the night without him . knowing, but prosecutors maintain he killed her after a loud argument . that caused her to possibly flee and hide in the toilet area. Mr . Mangena said the bullet that struck Ms Steenkamp's skull broke into two . fragments, one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her. The first shot into the right hip broke Ms Steenkamp's hip bone, Mr . Mangena said. 'I'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted, she dropped immediately,' Mr Mangena said. He . said Ms Steenkamp then slumped into a 'seated or semi-seated position' on top of a magazine rack near the toilet, where she was hit another two . times. 'She ended up with her head on top of the toilet seat, and the lower part of her body on the rack', Mr Mangena said. Pistorius . fired from a distance of at least 60 centimetres (24in) and no further . than a wall behind him, about three metres (10ft) away, Mr Mangena said. Back in court: June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva Steenkamp, left, sits next to African National Congress Women's League spokesperson Jackie Mofokeng, right, as details of her daughter's death are described to the court . Questioning: State prosecutor Gerrie Nel questions ballistics experts Captain Christiaan Mangena over how Ms Steenkamp was killed . He also described the impact of the type of bullets in Pistorius' gun, which were designed to cause maximum damage, he said. 'It . hits the target, it opens up, it creates six talons, and these talons . are sharp,' Mr Mangena said. 'It cuts through the organs of a human . being.' He noted the . Black Talon brand of ammunition was often used for self-defence because . while it caused significant damage to a human target, it was less likely . to penetrate the first target and hit other people. Mr . Mangena also said he conducted shooting tests to try to pinpoint the . location from which the bullets were fired by Pistorius in the bathroom, . based on where the cartridge cases were found. However, . in his tests, he said, the cases fell at different angles. He also . noted that the cartridge cases at the scene of Ms Steenkamp's shooting . could have been 'moved or kicked around' during the investigation. He . said Pistorius was probably on his stumps when he fired, supporting the . athlete's statement that he was not wearing his prosthetic limbs when . he opened fire. Mr Nel . also asked Mr Mangena to comment on a 2012 incident in which Pistorius . allegedly fired his gun out of the sunroof of a moving car. The athlete . faces a firearms charge in that case, as well as two other firearms . charges. Mr Mangena said firing a shot in such circumstances was dangerous. The . bullet leaves the barrel at around 280 metres (900 feet) a second, and . will travel upward, then stop and fall to the ground under the force of . gravity and wind deflection, he said. 'The bullet can still kill a person,' Mr Mangena said. Pistorius's sister was also in court today and appeared to hand Ms Steenkamp's mother June a handwritten note. It comes after Arnold Pistorius, the uncle of the athlete, approached the 67-year-old mother in court on Tuesday. According to the Mirror, he told her: 'I am so sorry for your loss. We as a family are just as heartroken for the life that has been lost. 'Like your family we are trying to fight for a life and also for a life that has been lost.' Together: Reeva Steenkamp pictured with Pistorius. The prosecution allege he intentionally killed her after an argument . Scene: Pistorius shot Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door at his home (above) in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year . In other testimony Wednesday, police Colonel Ian van der Nest testified that many of the blood spots and stains found in various parts of Pistorius' house were due to arterial bleeding, consistent with the gunshot wounds on Steenkamp's head and arm. Some stains came from Steenkamp's blood-soaked hair as well as her short pants, which had been saturated with blood, he said. Another witness, Col. Mike Sales, investigated the web history on two iPad tablets found in Pistorius' home. He analyzed the activity on one of the devices hours before Steenkamp was killed, he said. Around 6.30pm South African time on February 13, 2013, a search was made on Google for a pornographic website. Then, straight after, a page was accessed that was described with the words 'Mobile Porn, Free Mobile Porn, iPhone Porn, Phone Porn, iPad Porn'. Other Internet searches referred to car websites and details on cars, including a Ford Ranger SUV, an Aston Martin and a British-made Morgan sports car. Col. Sales said the searches and website history on the second iPad showed similar records to the first. The hearing was adjourned and will resume on Monday.","Pretoria High Court has been told Pistorius looked at porn and car websites on February 2013 - the night before he shot Reeva Steenkamp .

"By . Jill Reilly . Bookmaker Paddy Power is gloating after its 'disgusting' Oscar Pistorius advert has now become the most complained about advert of all time. Many of the record 5,525 complaints put to the Advertising Standards Authority were concerned the advert trivialised issues surrounding a murder trial, the death of a woman and also disability. But when the MailOnline contacted PaddyPower for a statement about the distress the advert had caused it bragged: 'In your face KFC!' Betting giant Paddy Power brought advertising into disrepute with its Oscar Pistorius 'money off if he walks' campaign that drew a record 5,525 complaints, the regulator has ruled . The Irish bookmaker, which is known for cheap pr stunts, is referring to a . 2005 KFC advert which saw call centre workers singing while eating and . drew 1,671 complaints. The . betting giant's advert became the most complained-about UK campaign of . all time two weeks ago, with thousands objecting to the offer of a . refund on all losing bets if the South African Paralympian is found not . guilty of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

This week the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the betting giant brought advertising into disrepute with its Oscar Pistorius 'money off if he walks' campaign which drew a record 5,525 complaints. The betting giant's advert became the most complained-about UK campaign of all time two weeks ago, partly fuelled by an online petition objecting to the offer of a refund on all losing bets if he is found not guilty of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .

Paddy Power . said that in the context of the high level of media coverage of the . trial, it was 'unsurprising' that complaints had been received. However, it 'strongly believed' that offering a market on a leading news story did not trivialise the issues surrounding the murder trial, death or disability. It said the ad was a reflection of public interest, which was perhaps led by the media, and was not a commentary on death, violence or disability. And while it accepted that there was a double meaning to 'if he walks', it did not go so far as to cause serious or widespread offence, but instead was an inoffensive and relevant play on words - adding that the company supported several sporting events that involved disabled athletes. Olympian sprinter Oscar Pistorius posing next to his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. The Advertising Standards Authority took the unusual step of ordering that the ad be immediately withdrawn while it investigated the complaints that it trivialised the issues surrounding a murder trial, the death of a woman and also disability . The Sun on Sunday said it had taken the decision to publish the ad in good faith and did not intend to cause offence to readers, but regretted that offence had been caused. It said it would ensure the concerns raised were taken into account in relevant future decisions. The ASA acknowledged that the ad made no explicit reference to death or violence. But . advertising rules stated that references to anyone who was dead must be . handled with particular care, saying the ad was likely to be . interpreted as making light of the issues surrounding the trial, which . included the death of a woman who had been shot by her boyfriend. It . also considered that the text 'money back if he walks' and the refund . offer was likely to be seen as making light of the serious . decision-making process involved in the trial, while references to . Pistorius's disability were also likely to cause serious or widespread . offence. The ASA said: . 'We acknowledged that the ad had appeared in the context of a high . profile murder trial that had received extensive media coverage and was . of interest to the public. 'We . considered it would therefore have been reasonable to foresee that . serious or widespread offence was likely to be caused by placing an ad . that sought commercial advantage based on that trial and which made . light of the sensitive issues involved. 'Given the content of the ad, and the prevailing circumstances at the time of its publication, we concluded that it brought advertising into disrepute.' The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form, adding: 'We told Paddy Power to ensure their future ads did not cause serious or widespread offence and did not bring advertising into disrepute.' 1.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Spilling secrets: Former CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo wrote a book about his 33 years at the agency . A new book by one of the CIA’s top lawyers has exposed decades-old secrets of the nation’s spy agency, telling his unfiltered thoughts on various presidents, the controversial waterboarding tapes and their back-door deals with Hollywood stars who wanted to trade secrets for cocaine. John Rizzo became publicly well known in 2007 when the Bush administration nominated him to be the General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency, but his nomination was blocked because of his approval of waterboarding. Much of his book, Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA, tells the previously-guarded tales of clandestine operations including their frequent partnerships with Hollywood stars. In the book, read by MailOnline, the connection between the CIA and the movie business was recently publicized by the film Argo, but Mr Rizzo’s book shows that their partnerships were more than just some creative storyboards and false movie advertisements. 'These are people who have made a lot of money basically creating make-believe stuff,' Mr Rizzo wrote, explaining why actors worked as perfect covers for intelligence operations. 'Their power and international celebrity can be valuable—it gives them entrée to people and places abroad. Heads of state want to meet and get cozy with them. Their film crews are given free rein everywhere, even in places where the U.S. government doesn’t normally have it.’ Hot topic: Rizzo's book, Company Man, opens with a discussion of his controversial handling of the video recordings of terror suspect Abu Zubaydah (left) being waterboarded . He didn’t name any specific names, but he recalled how one star who at first proclaimed to volunteer based on purely patriotic reasons actually had a different idea of how he should be rewarded for his help. Mr Rizzo recalled an interesting conversation with the CIA employee who was the handler for this particular actor: ‘The actor refuses to take any money, but he told us that instead all he wants is for us to score him the best fifty-thousand-dollar stash of cocaine we can find. He seems to think we can get the real primo stuff. So that’s why I’m here. Is it okay for us to do it?’ he recalled the unidentified agent asking. Mr Rizzo shot down the request and said that the actor ended up helping the agency free of charge. Some of the more politically-loaded anecdotes that Mr Rizzo included about the Commanders-in-Chief who were in charge during his time at the CIA, which he joined in 1976. He repeatedly slammed President Clinton and said that after he was elected ‘it was increasingly apparent that President Clinton couldn’t care less about the Agency or the rest of the intelligence community’. 'Couldn't care less': Rizzo slammed President Clinton, saying that he 'wasn't interested in, didn't care about, the Agency at all' and gave them the worst snub that by sending Hillary to an agent's funeral in his place . Not a fan: Breaking his own rule of always voting for an incumbent president or party successor, Mr Rizzo opted not to vote for John McCain in 2008 because he had 'serious pause about his temperament' ‘(Clinton) wasn’t interested in, didn’t care about, the Agency at all. For an organization whose relevance and impact is so utterly dependent on its relationship with the commander in chief, being ignored is even worse than being mistrusted,’ he wrote. His most damning critique came when he told how the Democratic President sent then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to attend the funeral for a fallen operative in his place. Mr Rizzo called the move ‘the most hurtful presidential snub I witnessed in my entire career’. ‘Bill Clinton, our new president, couldn’t find the time to make the ten -minute trip from the White House to the CIA to pay his respects. He sent his wife instead. It was an unforgivable slight from a man who had famously told the American people during his just-completed campaign, “I feel your pain,”’ Mr Rizzo wrote. His appears to have taken the most personal slight from Clinton but did not pass that along to the rest of his administration. ‘Unlike Clinton, Al Gore had always seemed to be a sophisticated, engaged, and supportive patron of the CIA.... George W. Bush, on the other hand, was a governor with zero experience in intelligence matters,’ he wrote. In spite of his clear problems with President Clinton, that didn’t stop him from voting for him in his re-election as he admits to always voting for an incumbent president or their successor. The only exception to this rule was the 2008 election when he opted to vote for Barack Obama over John McCain to follow President Bush’s two terms, and he wrote ‘what I had heard and personally observed about John McCain gave me serious pause about his temperament’. Positive temperament: Former CIA directors George Tenet (left) and Leon Panetta (right) were both praised for their approachable and comfortable manners in dealing with their inferiors . Mr Rizzo clearly has interesting views on the various Presidents, but his insights were even more detailed when it came to their appointments of CIA directors. He called George Tenet, the director appointed by President Clinton who served through a portion of President Bush’s term as well, ‘the most “regular guy”’ director during his tenure and praised his easy and comfortable approach with staff. ‘He often shambled into meetings in the hallowed director’s conference room with tie askew, sometimes in his stocking feet, gnawing away on an unlit Cuban cigar from the stash he had accumulated courtesy of visiting heads of foreign intelligence services,’ Mr Rizzo wrote. He gave a similarly-positive review of Leon Panetta, who was appointed by President Obama. ‘For his part, (Panetta) looked every bit as Italian as his name, but it was more the way he came across— sunny, earthy, without a shred of formality or phoniness— that reminded me of my late father and all of his brothers who had been the products, like Panetta, of a first-generation Italian American family,’ Mr Rizzo wrote. ‘He loved to laugh and joke, as did I, and we were forming an easy, bantering relationship.’ The book was released on Tuesday, coming out just days before the controversial tell-all written by former Secretary of State Bob Gates who slammed his former commander, President Obama. Mr Rizzo left the CIA in 2009, making his five year break between being in office and publishing his book significantly longer than year-and-a-half that Mr Gates’ waited, but Mr Rizzo implies that it is something of an inevitability that all secrets will end up coming out eventually. ‘If all my years and experience at the CIA taught me anything, it’s that virtually every secret doesn’t stay secret forever, and that the shelf life of new secrets is getting shorter all the time,’ he wrote.","John Rizzo, the former CIA acting attorney general, has written a book about his 33 years at the nation's top spy agency .

"By . Margot Peppers . A woman is taking legal action after diet pills caused her to have a psychotic breakdown which landed her in a mental hospital. Army reservist Sainah Theodore from Queens told the New York Daily News she is suing the Natural Health Food Center in Brooklyn for unspecified damages after diet pills she bought there gave her six days of insomnia, which in turn led to erratic and violent behavior. At the peak of her delirium, the 26-year-old says she heard voices, stopped her car in the middle of a busy intersection and stabbed pillows and pictures in her own home before medics had to be called. Under fire: Army reservist Sainah Theodore is suing the Natural Health Food Center for unspecified damages after Natural Lipo Z (pictured), the diet pills she bought there, caused a psychotic breakdown . She then spent five days in a mental hospital and her deployment to Afghanistan had to be delayed. 'Once I came out of the sedation, it was clear to me it was the pill that caused it,' she said. The trouble began when the health store sold Miss Theodore a product called Natural Lipo X which, unbeknownst to her, contained illegal stimulants that weren't labeled on the packaging. According to the Daily News, lab tests later confirmed that the pills contained high levels of caffeine and a laxative called Phenolphthalein which is illegal to sell over-the-counter. Another ingredient was weight-loss . stimlant Sibutramine, which was banned by the FDA in 2010 'due to a long . list of side effects that includes sleeplessness'. 'Once I came out of the sedation, it was clear to me it was the pill that caused it' It was these stimulants, the suit claims, that led to Miss Theodore's bizarre and destructive behavior - which included sending her mother aggressive texts and 'causing total destruction of her home,' said her lawyer Brian Pascale. 'I couldn't believe all of this . happened to me. It was a blur,' said Miss Theodore, who studies sociology. 'I had no recollection of my behavior.' Defense: Employees at the store (pictured) say that her reaction was the result of the insurance company claiming that she was fasting while taking the pills . She and her lawyers are suing the health food center, where employees claim that her reaction was the result of the insurance company saying that she was fasting while taking the pills. 'We can't leave the store to see the customer eats well,' said store manager Kennedy Angeliz. 'The insurance is handling this. That's all I will say.' 'Individuals who adulterate . products with illegal ingredients are not complying with . current regulations' Miss Theodore's lawyers have denied this claim, asserting that she ate normally while on the diet pills. Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Product Association, said these spiked pills are part of an even bigger problem in the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. 'Individuals who intentionally adulterate products with illegal and undeclared ingredients are not complying with current laws and regulations,' he explained. 'The federal government and the regulated supplement industry work together to raise awareness about these tainted products.'","Sainah Theodore is suing the Natural Health Food Center in Brooklyn for selling her Natural Lipo X, a brand of diet pills that contain illegal and unlabeled stimulants .

"By . Katy Winter . The Duchess of Cambridge is celebrating her 32nd birthday today in private the palace has announced. As a mother of a five-month-old baby it is unlikely the Duchess will be revelling into the small hours, but at least this year she will be able to indulge in a glass or two off champagne on her big day, having been pregnant on her last birthday. Though it is not known what the Duchess will be doing to mark her first birthday as a parent, it is likely the family-orientated royal will spend the day with husband William, who has just started a bespoke course at Cambridge University, at their Kensington Palace apartment. Scroll down for video . A truly momentous year: This year will doubtless be etched forever into Kate and William's memory as both became parents for the first time on July 22 . The Duchess of Cambridge carries Prince George after his christening at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury on October 23 . The hands-on mother will also likely involve Prince George in any celebrations she chooses to have, though it is not yet known if Kate’s own parents, who she is very close to, will see their daughter today. The past 12 months have been a life changing period for Kate who gave birth to Prince George in the summer. Her baby son was christened in front of the Queen, Prince of Wales and other members of the immediate family in October and she has also begun to take on solo royal engagements this year. But after such an eventful year, a simple romantic birthday meal at home could be on the cards for Kate who was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, on January 9 1982. Kate and husband William recently moved into their Kensington Palace apartment and an intimate dinner could be held at the picturesque royal residence. A Kensington Palace spokesman said that Kate would be spending her birthday 'privately'.

This is in keeping with the couple, who were careful to keep their relationship as private as possible when they were dating at St Andrews University in Scotland, before marrying in April 2011. William began an agricultural management course at Cambridge University on Monday and may spend much of Kate's birthday studying at the famous university, or catching up on the long list of reading expected of Cambridge students. The Duke is commuting a number of days a week to attend the course run by the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership. William was admitted to the prestigious institution for a 'bespoke' course in agricultural management, which will prepare him for when he inherits the Duchy of Cornwall, one of the biggest private estates in the country, from his father. The much-anticipated first official family portrait after the birth of Prince George, which, true to Kate's family orientated nature was snapped by her father . Despite a jam packed year, Kate has stepped up to her royal duties, attending numerous charity events, such as meeting the Royal British Legion Poppy sellers in Kensington in November . Kate has had a fun filled year, attended premieres such as David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive, where she wore 3D glasses (left), as well as Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom (right) But while William has been preparing for his role as full time royal, his wife too has had a busy year . As the Queen reduces the number of public engagements she attends, the younger royals, and Kate and Wills in particular, are increasingly stepping forward to fill the gaps. The 87-year-old monarch conducted 341 official events this year, compared to 425 in 2012 - a drop of about 20 per cent. Despite being pregnant for much of the year, Kate has managed to attend numerous events and premieres, finding time to support her chosen charities and support her husband. Kate also stunned the public with springing back to shape astonishingly quickly after the birth of Prince George in July. Prince William arrives for his first day to study Agricultural Management at University of Cambridge He will learn about the issues facing the UK's rural communities and the farming industry during the 10 week course . The Duchess' enviably flat stomach was revealed to the world when she played volleyball in Olympic Park for charity SportsAid in October. It is understood the Duchess got back her trim figure through long walks with her dog, Lupo, and the odd burst on a rowing machine. She also took part in ante-natal yoga classes, which are believed to help new mothers regain their figure afterwards by ‘training’ their muscles to snap back into shape.","Duchess turns 32 today and will celebrate 'privately' palace announces .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Helen Pow . and Associated Press . and Ryan Gorman . Olympic skier Bode Miller opened up Thursday morning about his despair at how a custody battle with a former flame was portrayed in the press. Miller told the 'Today Show' that it was difficult to see 11-month-old son Sam thrust into the spotlight while he and the boy's mother, former Marine Sara McKenna, 27, hammered out the details of a temporary custody agreement in place until at least a March 31 court date. Miller, 36, spoke from Germany, where he is preparing for a World Cup event, that despite being accustomed to dealing with the press, it's much more difficult when it involves family. Scroll down for video . It's difficult: Bode Miller claims the media spun his custody in a light that didn't reflect the facts of the case . 'The real difficult part is anytime it’s family or things that are really personal,' the five-time gold medalist told the 'Today Show.' 'Reading about them is one thing, reading about them when they’re not true [is another]. 'When they’re completely spun in one direction all the time and having to just accept that and not fight a public battle because that’s what the media really thrives on,' Miller continued, 'That was really difficult.' Miller griped that the media used 'a tiny amount of information' to come to far different conclusions than family court judges did, and that the press narrative put a defenseless child in an unfortunate position. 'When it’s about a small child who can’t really defend themselves or is going to have to deal with the repercussions of that in the future, that’s a really tough thing to deal with,' Miller said. Difficult: Miller said that despite his being used to dealing with the media, it's much harder when family matters are portrayed inaccurately . Defenseless: Miller also griped that his son was unfairly thrust into the spotlight and put into a position of having to deal with the ramifications of that in the future . The skier also spoke about looking forward to what will likely be his final Olympics, saying he feels his age and that he has to work harder to keep up with the younger skiers after knee surgery. He did add though, that going to the games with expectations lower than a medal is not why he's hitting the slopes. 'Anything outside of the medals is not why you’re going there,' Miller said. His comments came one month to the day after the details of a custody agreement between he and McKenna were made public. The temporary custody agreement in place until at least March 31 allows the skier to take the child to . the Winter Olympics next month in Russia. Miller . and McKenna had a brief relationship last year in California but he has . since married professional volleyball player Morgan Beck. Agreement: Olympic skier Bode Miller, center, exits family court, Monday, December 9, 2013, in New York . Shared custody: Miller and former flame Sara McKenna, pictured, agreed to share time with their infant son for four months . The case became a cause for women's rights advocates after a judge castigated McKenna for moving while pregnant to New York. She's studying at Columbia University. The boy, who Miller calls Nathaniel in honor of his late younger brother, will spend time with his mother while she pursues her studies. Case referee Fiordaliza Rodriguez of the Manhattan Family Court approved the agreement, issuing a temporary order after a short conference in her courtroom. 'I'm happy to see that both parties are working this out,' Rodriguez said, according to the New York Daily News. The child was not present at the courthouse. Happy: Miller, 36, and McKenna, 27, said, separately, after court they were happy about the arrangement, which allows the skier to take the child to the Olympics in February in Russia . McKenna has had temporary custody of Sam since November while Miller was away in Canada and Colorado seeking to qualify for his fifth Olympics. The child attended his father's season opener in Austria in October, when Miller had temporary custody. The former lovers met through an online dating service in California and went on several dates before McKenna discovered she was pregnant. By the time she informed him of the pregnancy, Miller was already seeing Beck, who is now his wife. Some have defended McKenna's New York move after Rodriquez dubbed it irresponsible because it moved the case to a different legal forum. The news comes after Beck said it was 'fate' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they wouldn't have been able to spend as much time with the 11-month-old toddler. McKenna was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the Thanksgiving holiday, before the bitter exes and their legal teams got back in a Manhattan court last month. Airing their views: Bode Miller and his wife Morgan Beck, who he married shortly after ending his relationship with Sara McKenna, announced that she miscarried last January . Holding on tight: Just before Thanksgiving, a judge overturned the previous custody ruling that gave the Millers the rights to the child he had with Sara McKenna (pictured), allowing her to care for the child until December 9 . Miller met McKenna through the high-end dating service after they both expressed interest in settling down. Their relationship didn't last long, however, but McKenna discovered she was pregnant with his child by the time he had already begun dating his now-wife Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player. McKenna later released a text she sent to Miller after asking him to join her at an ultrasound appointment. He refused to go and wrote: 'U made this choice against my wish'. In October, McKenna warned Miller that there was a possibility that she would be moving across the country: 'Just a heads up, I met with an advisor from Columbia today and we will probably be moving there in the fall.' That same month, he married Beck after dating for just five months and in November he submitted a 'Petition to Establish Parental Relationship' in a California court, identifying himself as the father of a child who was not yet born. Miller and Beck announced that she was pregnant weeks later, only to reveal shortly after that she had a miscarriage. 'It was awful. Morgan and I hadn't planned on getting pregnant, but we were excited. In hindsight, now, we can see what an incredible challenge having two babies would have been. I don't believe in fate- that everything happens for a reason- but Morgan does,' Miller said in an interview with Us Weekly, a portion of which is online. That reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to Miller's son with McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. McKenna calls him Sam after giving the boy Miller's legal name, Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, when she gave birth to him in New York last February. Fighting for his son: Miller and his wife had custody of the boy, who they refer to as Nate while his mother calls him Sam, for months leading up to the reversal before Thanksgiving . Evolving: Morgan, a professional volleyball player, got pregnant expectantly but had a miscarriage shortly after announcing it . Virtual guilt trip: Bode, his wife and his daughter Dace (right) from another previous relationship celebrated an early Christmas last month in Colorado when McKenna had custody of 'Nate' and he posted this photo . Miller later petitioned a court in his home state of California to add Nathaniel as a middle name in honor of his brother who died in April. Now he and Beck refer to the boy as Nate. The couple argued that McKenna had been conducting a virtual smear campaign against them, and while they maintain that they have not fought back, they are changing their ways now because it will effect the skier's career as he trains for the Winter Olympics. Her strike back: McKenna posted multiple photos of she and 'Sam' over Thanksgiving, including this one of them at the Macy's parade . Miller told The Boston Globe earlier that McKenna is directly attacking his brand. '(McKenna has) been directly attacking that. It's so pointless in this case because it has no bearing on anything. It doesn't make any difference,' he told the paper. 'It's just, when you are in a position where things aren't going your way — my wife does it all the time if she's losing a fight or something, she just switches the fight to something else that she thinks she can win at. Just totally changes the argument to something else. It's not a bad tactic. It's just kind of pointless.' Other factors weighed in on the argument, however, turning the case into a question of women's rights as one New York judge initially ruled that McKenna was 'forum shopping' for more favorable courts by moving from California in her third trimester. He awarded custody to Miller. After that September 3 decision, McKenna told The New York Times that her ex and new wife wasted no time uprooting the boy as they came back to her apartment 'took the baby out of my arms, dropped it in a car seat and drove away.' A second judge then reversed that decision though the case is still ongoing with the next hearing due for March 31. The Millers arrived at the Manhattan court with 'Nate' in tow last week and McKenna took the child after the hearing as she was granted custody over the Thanksgiving holiday. Bi-coastal contention: After meeting Miller in San Diego, McKenna moved to New York when she was pregnant and gave birth to the boy there, but the Millers argue she moved to be in a more favorable state for the custody case . She posted photos of she and 'Sam' together in New York, including one of the pair attending the Thanksgiving Day parade. Even though he didn't have his son near him to post new photos, Miller didn't let the social media war stay put there: he posted an old photo of 'Nate' and Dace, his 5-year-old daughter from another previous relationship. He and Morgan had discussed online how they were celebrating an 'early' Christmas in Colorado, and the picture of 'Nate' and Dace read: 'She's super sad her brother isn't here to celebrate with us.'","Bode Miller said the media created a far different narrative than what more than one judge determined after a series of hearings .

"By . Ashley Collman . Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels really wants to end debate that his show lacks diversity. In addition to hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show, he's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male-dominated writer's room. Comediennes LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones tried out for the opening cast member position last month, and the show's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes. Scroll down for video . New hires: LaKendra Tookes (left) and Leslie Jones (right) were hired as Saturday Night Live writers after auditioning for a cast member position last month. They will join a mostly white male-dominated writer's room  on the sketch comedy show as creator Lorne Michaels seeks to address lack of diversity complaints . The new writer announcement comes after Zamata's hiring was made official on Monday.  Zamata will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Jones was a finalist for Zamata's cast member slot, and has guest starred on such shows as The League and Sullivan & Son. She has performed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and her stand-up special 'Problem Child' was broadcast on Showtime. Tookes on the other hand is a former news reporter from Florida who has performed her comedy at iO West theater in Los Angeles. While neither women is slated to perform on the show, many SNL writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer. Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis made the jump, as well as current featured player Mike O'Brien. Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007 . Live from New York: Zamata will make her debut on Saturday Night Live during the January 18 episode hosted by Drake . Rumors that a new player might be added . to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions . were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black . female comediennes in LA. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times . that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the . first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels . also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was . initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He . saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their . performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for . the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels . says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of . the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them . into the last episodes of the season. While many have criticized the show . for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady . Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do . with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live . has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the . 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no . sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past . 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show.","LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones auditioned for a cast member position last month and were hired as writers instead .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Cleared: Gary Davies was cleared of attempted murder after slashing his girlfriend's throat when she ended their two-month relationship . A student who 'sawed' his girlfriend's neck with a kitchen knife after she ended their two-month relationship has today been cleared of attempted murder. Gary Davies locked 19-year-old Robyn Clegg-Gibson in her bedroom before slashing a 7cm cut across her throat, because he was concerned about 'losing face' in front of her friends. The 26-year-old, who denied attempted murder but admitted two charges of wounding with intent and false imprisonment, lashed out at the teenager in the early hours of September 30 last year. After the couple returned home to Miss Clegg-Gibson's house at Lancaster University, where they both studied, Davies dealt five blows with a serrated kitchen knife, because he 'wanted to leave a scar'. Giving evidence at his trial at Preston Crown Court, Davies, who was described as a 'demanding' boyfriend, said he originally grabbed a pair of scissors to scare his girlfriend. He told the court he became 'angry and upset', when Miss Clegg-Gibson ended the relationship. He said: 'I wanted to scare her but I didn’t think scissors were intimidating enough, then I saw the knife in the drawer. 'I wanted to give her something to remember not to mess with me. I was losing face as I saw it with her and her friends. 'The argument was trivial but it was still on my mind. I was worked up. I started thinking she was going to get away with this but I’m going to get in trouble. 'I was angry and upset and I wanted to leave a scar. I wanted to give her something to remember everytime she looks in the mirror. I was just stabbing everywhere.' After telling Davies she wanted to end their relationship, Miss Clegg-Gibson allowed him into her home to look for his keys, which he claimed he had lost during their night out. Attack: Davies, 26, (left) locked Robyn Clegg-Gibson (right) in her bedroom and slashed a 7cm cut across her throat. He denied attempted murder but confessed to wounding with intent and false imprisonment . Help: Miss Clegg-Gibson called police while Davies grabbed a knife from downstairs. Threatening her, he told her to call them back, and tell officers they were not needed at the address . Growing uncomfortable at his presence, she asked him to leave her bedroom, but Davies refused. While she reached for the phone to call the police, Davies - an astrology student at the university - went into the kitchen and grabbed a knife. When he returned to Miss Clegg-Gibson's bedroom he locked the door behind him. Threatening her with a knife, Davies told Miss Clegg-Gibson to call the police back and tell them not to come to the address. But minutes later a police officer arrived, sending Davies into a panic. Prosecutor Paul Cummings, told the court: 'He climbed on top of her and started to saw at her neck. She had her hand up and was trying to stop him. 'She was curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding and could feel the knife on her throat.' Davies, who was also in his first year at university but lived in different student accommodation, was stopped when the police officer kicked down the door. Haunted: Robyn Clegg-Gibson seen arriving at Preston Crown Court, has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the terrifying attack last September . Demanding: She told the jury he had been 'very demanding', wanting to see her every day after they met through a friend . His victim suffered a 7cm cut across her neck, which had cut deep into fatty tissue but had not severed a blood vessel or caused nerve damage. Miss Clegg-Gibson, who told the jury during the trial that she thought she was going to die, has received counselling since the attack and is having more sessions starting next month to help her cope with her ordeal. Following sessions over the Christmas period, her counsellor concluded that she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, struggles to sleep and remains 'anxious and uneasy'. A jury of seven men and five women found Davies not guilty of attempted murder and returned the unamimous verdict after 32 minutes of deliberations. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on April 14 for the other charges after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The parents of a baby girl who died after her skull was crushed during a forceps delivery are suing the Texas hospital where she was born. Rachel Melancon had experienced a healthy pregnancy, but when a doctor at the Medical Center of Southeast Texas used forceps during the birth on December 28 it had devastating consequences. As the medical device was clamped around her baby's head, the 24-year-old and her fiance Allen Coats claim they heard a popping sound as their daughter's skull was crushed. Heartbroken: Allen Coats and Rachel Melancon with baby Olivia whose skull was crushed during an attempted forceps delivery . Damage: Baby Olivia was born with a fractured skull and broken spinal cord, which left her brain damaged . The baby girl, named Olivia Marie, survived for five more days after being left brain damaged and with a fractured skull and severed spinal cord. Her parents plan to sue their obstetrician, Dr George T Backardjiev, and the Medical Center of Southeast Texas. The couple have also started a Facebook campaign page to petition against the use of forceps in all births. Ms Melancon, at 4ft 11in and weighing 95lb before she became pregnant, had asked for a cesarean section when her baby was overdue and large, considering her mother's petite frame. But doctors warned her against having that type of delivery, saying she'd be left with a scar, her mother-in-law Angie Coats told ABC News. After going into labor, baby Oliva's heart rate was increasing but the expectant mom kept being told to wait. 'It was 18 hours until the delivery. [Rachel] was running a 103 fever ... Five hours passed, then [the obstetrician] came in . and she started to push. But she was so worn out and the baby wasn't . even in the birth canal,' Ms Coats said. Hope: Rachel had experienced a healthy pregnancy and the couple were looking forward to their baby's arrival . Difficulties: Rachel had asked for a C-section because she was overdue and her baby was comparatively large for her petite 4ft 11in frame. Her request was turned down . Campaign: Rachel and Allen, pictured with Olivia, have started a petition to have forceps banned . She claimed the baby was facing the wrong way and Dr Backardjiev tried to turn her with his hands. 'When he couldn't do that, he took the . small forceps to try to pull the baby out. He kept going and even put . his foot up on the bed trying to pull,' she said. In a forceps delivery a metal instrument, shaped like salad tongs, is clamped around the baby's head. They are used to either guide the baby out the birth canal or, if the baby is facing the wrong way, to rotate the baby. The mother is generally given an episiotomy - an incision from the vagina to the anus - as there is an increased likelihood of tearing. It is considered a risky delivery, with the Mayo Clinic reminding expectant mothers that generally when a forceps delivery is recommended a C-Section is also an option. In the mother, forceps can cause long-term urinary or fecal incontinence; genital tears; and damage to the uterus or bladder. For babies, forceps can cause fractures, bleeding within the skull and facial injuries. 'When he touched the top and side of the skull, we heard a pop, like clay cracking in pottery and heard her skull crush.' Ms Melancon was rushed off for an emergency cesarean but when Olivia was finally delivered the family say she was unable breathe.

"By . Mark Prigg . New Yorkers are set for a rare astronomical phenomenon tonight as an asteroid blacks out a star in the night sky. 163 Erigone,  a 45-mile (73-kilometer)-wide asteroid in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter will eclipse the brightest star in the Constellation Leo. This so-called occultation will last no more than 14 seconds, around 2 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT). Where to look: Looking southwest (90° to the right of the Moon) around 2 a.m. EDT on the morning of March 20th. Regulus will appear roughly as high as the Moon. It's the brightest star in the area. Around 2 a.m. or a bit before, go out and face the Moon. Extend your arms straight out to your sides. Regulus will be straight above your right hand, roughly as high as the Moon is. It's the brightest star in that area. What makes this unusual is the brightness of Regulus and the potential viewing audience of around 20 million people. Weather permitting, the eclipse should be visible with the naked eye from New York City and elsewhere along a populated swath in the U.S. Northeast and eastern Canada. The star will vanish from sight for up to 14 seconds around 2:06 a.m. EDT on the morning of the 20th for New Yorkers, and a minute or two later farther north. 'Regulus shines right through moonlight and light pollution that's in the sky — even the light pollution over a city like New York,"" says Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. 'Just be sure to shield your eyes against any glary lights, and Regulus should be easy to find. 'Think of it as a space-rock eclipse of a star.' Where it will be visible: The predicted occultation path. The blue lines show the outer edges of the zone where Regulus will be blacked out if the prediction is perfect. Astronomers use the term occultation for these events, from the Latin word for 'hid'. 'I've been using a telescope to go after asteroid occultations of really faint stars for ages. I never thought we'd get one in my life for a star this bright and easy.' This is the first time in history that an occultation of such a bright star by an asteroid has been predicted to cross such a heavily populated area. Regulus will vanish behind the asteroid 163 Erigone for several seconds on the morning of March 20, 2014, for well-placed skywatchers. Asteroid occultation timers — an elite specialty crowd among amateur astronomers — hope to enlist thousands of everyday folks in a citizen-science project to document this event more thoroughly than any asteroid occultation has been before. You can participate with just your eyes, or with a DSLR camera in movie mode, or with better gear if you're into serious astronomy stuff. This effort is being spearheaded by the International Occultation Timing Association (IOTA). Its website for the public telling all about the event and how to participate is occultations.org/Regulus2014. Two past successes. The double asteroid Antiope and big, roundish Interamnia blotted out faint background stars on July 19, 2011, and March 23, 2003, respectively. The goal is to see whether the star disappears as seen from your location, and for how long — especially if you can time the event to high precision. From this data, astronomers hope to obtain a very precise profile of Erigone's size and shape, something that cannot be done any other way short of sending a spacecraft there. This has been done for many asteroids in the past that have occulted fainter stars.","Will occur at 2am New York time and be visible with the naked eye .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . An Egyptian-born mother of twins who believes women are hindered by ‘a sticky door’ rather than a glass ceiling yesterday landed one of the biggest financial jobs in Britain. Dr Nemat Shafik [corr] will become only the second female deputy governor of the Bank of England in August. The 51-year-old, still known by her childhood nickname of ‘Minouche’, will be taking on a job on which every family’s fortunes in Britain depend. Nemat Shafik, 51, will become the second ever female deputy governor of the Bank of England in August . As well as helping to set interest . rates, the Bank said Dr Shafik must also mastermind the ‘eventual exit’ from its £375billion quantitative easing programme, more widely known as . ‘money printing’. It is the . latest extraordinary twist in the meteoric career of a woman whose . childhood experiences might have thwarted others’ ambitions. She . was born in Alexandria, Egypt but her family forced to flee at the age . of four to escape General Nasser’s nationalisations of the 1960s. Robbed . of their possessions, they fled to America, and Dr Shafik has . subsequently said the traumatic experience has left ‘a strong legacy’. She said: ‘My father in particular, I think, never got over that, having lost everything.’ But . her career has been spectacularly successful ever since, becoming the . youngest-ever vice president of the World Bank at the age of just 35. After . leaving the World Bank, she moved to the Department for International . Development, rising to become its permanent secretary between 2008 and . 2011. Since April 2011, she . has been the deputy managing director of the International Monetary . Fund. Asked about the glass ceiling, Dr Shafik, who has ten-year-old . twins, said the metaphor is ‘not a good one’. At just 35 she became the youngest-ever vice president of the World Bank, and most recently worked as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund . In . an interview in 2009, she said: ‘I know the concept of it is that it is . supposed to mean that there is an invisible barrier. But it also . implies that, if you could break through it, then everybody could get . through and it is not quite that simple. In my experience it is more . like a sticky door. ‘In . order to get through it, you have to give it a nudge because it won’t . open automatically. And it helps a lot if you’ve got allies on the other . side of the door giving it a pull.’ Dr . Shafik, who speaks English, Arabic and French, used to be married to . the super-wealthy Mohamed El-Erian, the former chief executive of Pimco, . the world’s largest bond house. In 2002, she married Raffael Jovine, with whom she had the twins, and is also step-mother to his three daughters. She . has spoken of the struggles faced by mothers trying to combine a career . with a busy family life, saying she is often ‘guilty’ of working in the . evenings at home. She said: . ‘The fact is I can get home, have dinner with my kids, put them to bed . and then do some work after they’ve gone to sleep.’ Dr Shafik, who is a national of Britain, America and Egypt, will be paid a basic salary of around £260,000 by the Bank. She . will also be eligible to receive up to £78,000, equal to 30 per cent of . her salary, if she chooses not to join the Bank’s generous pension . scheme.","Nemat Shafik, 51, to become Bank of England deputy governor in August .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Information about an undercover operation to get information from a suspect in the murder of Stephen Lawrence, pictured, was leaked by one of the handlers, it emerged today . An undercover police operation to target a suspect in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry was thrown into turmoil after a leak by their handler, it emerged today. Two police officers, a man and a woman, moved into a house next door to one of the prime suspects, posing as a couple, and set out to befriend the suspect, who was seen as a potential weak link, in a top-secret sting. But the safety of the officers, who lived in the property for several years, passing on useful intelligence to detectives, was compromised when one of their welfare officers told a friend about the covert operation. The leak only came to light when the friend, who had no connection to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) force, which supplied the covert officers, was spoken to by police about an affair she had with a GMP officer not linked to the Lawrence sting. The handler was removed from the unit for leaking confidential information, but police bosses decided not to stop the operation, according to a tip passed on to the Manchester Evening News. The undercover operation, which is thought to have begun in 2002, nearly a decade after the black teenager was killed, continued, with the couple often wired up to relay live conversations with the suspect. It involved two officers from Manchester posing as a couple who had just moved down to London from the north, as police believed using officers from London would be too obvious. Only a handful of the top officers at GMP knew about the sting, and a back-up team of 20 officers was on standby in case the couple's cover was blown, placing their lives in danger. The suspect targeted by the sting - one of five men suspected of murdering the 18-year-old - has not been named.  GMP had been asked to provide officers to go undercover as it was thought too obvious to use London officers. But the officers were not involved in the operation by Scotland Yard's disgraced Special Demonstration Squad, an ultra-secret wing of Special Branch which is now the subject of a public inquiry. Earlier this month, a report into the . SDS unit revealed that it had placed a spy in the camp of the family of . the teenager, who was stabbed to death in south-east London in April . 1993. Gary Dobson, 38, left, and David Norris, 37, right, were both convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence . One senior source with surveillance expertise, said: 'I would be surprised if my officers were left undercover if their safety had been compromised by such a monumental leak of information. 'The Met and GMP would have no guarantee of knowing who else the woman had gossiped to about the operation.' Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, of GMP, said: 'Greater Manchester Police does not normally confirm or deny information about undercover police deployments unless it has become public knowledge as part of criminal proceedings. 'The position is necessary to protect the identity of those officers who carry out, or have carried out, undercover work.'","Two police officers posing as a couple tried to befriend murder suspect .

"By . Emma Innes . A 27-year-old Chinese man has had a two stone (13kg) tumour removed from his back and neck. Yang Xiao, from Xi'an in Shaanxi province, developed the tumour when he was a teenager and it grew steadily until it was removed on February 19. He was warned surgery would be risky but that without it the tumour would continue to grow. Yang Xiao, 27, has had surgery in China to remove a two stone tumour from his back. He is pictured (left) before the operation which took place on February 19 this year. He is pictured (right) after the surgery . As a result, he eventually underwent a nine-hour operation to remove the growth. During the operation he lost so much blood that he had to been given around 40 pints of blood in the form of transfusions. Dr Yang Li said the surgery was quite challenging because the tumor was tightly connected to the spine and was rich with blood vessels. However, surgeons were able to remove it and Mr Yang was released from hospital on March 12. Mr Yang developed a small tumour on his neck about ten years ago. It grew rapidly and was soon as big as an egg. Mr Yang's surgery took nine hours and surgeons said it was hard as the tumour was full of blood vessels . During the operation, Mr Yang lost so much blood he had to be given four adults worth in transfusions. He is pictured (centre) with his doctors and his father (second from the left) In 2007, he went to hospital in Xi’an and the tumour was diagnosed as fibromatosis – a benign soft tissue tumour. Mr Yang and his father, Yang Jigao, considered surgery and were warned it was difficult and risky. As a result, his father, who had already lost his wife and daughter, decided not to take the risk. After leaving the hospital, Mr Yang’s tumour continued to grow. Mr Yang (pictured before his operation) was released from hospital on March 12 this year . Mr Yang first developed a small tumour on his neck when he was a teenager but it grew rapidly . Mr Yang considered having surgery in 2007 but his father did not want him to as he was warned it was risky and he had already lost his wife and daughter so couldn't face losing his son as well . It was soon as large as half a football and more tumours had appeared on his back and collarbone. At the end of 2013 the father and son returned to hospital – this time they went to Xijing Hospital, in Xi’an. By this point the tumour on Mr Yang’s back measured 45cm from top to bottom and 30cm across. It was also 17cm thick and weighed two stone. Surgeons informed Mr Yang that surgery would be risky but that he would have a good chance of recovery. Mr Yang's tumour was still growing so he eventually decided to have surgery and raised the money for an operation. He was warned it would be difficult but told he has a good chance of recovery . Mr Yang (pictured before the operation) had to give up his job because of the tumour . They also explained that without surgery the tumours would probably grow fast. As a result, he and his father decided he should undergo surgery. People from his hometown donated about £2,000, and his father borrowed £10,000, to pay for the operation. Fibromatosis refers to a group of benign soft tissue tumours. The tumours are rare but often grow aggressively and frequently return after they have been removed.","Yang Xiao developed a small tumour on his neck as a teenager .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton has threatened protests against New York retailer Barneys and a possible boycott for 'upscale racial profiling' after two black shoppers said they were discriminated against. 'In major cities like New York, blacks . and Latinos not only worry about being “stopped-and-frisked” by police, . but they also fear the embarrassment of being “shopped-and-frisked” in . retail stores,' he said in an opinion piece for the New York Daily News. 'Perhaps all retailers need a friendly reminder of the immense buying power of blacks and minorities. We will definitely remember those who welcome us and those who would rather profile us, and we will speak loudly with our dollars — bottom line.' Time for action:The Rev. Al Sharpton has condemned 'shop and frisk' at Manhattan stores and called for a boycott of Barneys . Two black Barneys customers said this week they were detained by police after making expensive purchases. Trayon Christian, 19, sued Barneys, saying he was accosted by undercover NYPD officers after using his debit card to buy a $349 Ferragamo belt in April. Kayla Phillips, 21, said she was surrounded and interrogated by police after purchasing a $2,500 handbag from Barneys in February. Sharpton said it was a 'travesty' that police and retailers interrogate black people who buy expensive items. 'Barneys, a high-end retailer with stores in major cities, must answer for this pattern of biased behavior, as must the NYPD,' he wrote. 'Our National Action Network (NAN) Brooklyn chapter President Kirsten John Foy said it best when he called Barneys’ behavior schizophrenic. On the one hand, they want to expand their brand to the urban market, but then they turn around and see us as suspects rather than prospects. 'Barneys and other retailers that openly discriminate against us must be held accountable. Simply apologizing isn’t enough; we need to see a plan of action as to how they are going to rectify their ways.' Accountability: Sharpton said Barneys, a high-end retailer with stores in major cities, must answer for its 'pattern of biased behavior' Sharpton has demanded a meeting with Barneys CEO, Mark Lee, and is 'currently mobilizing activists for peaceful direct-action against the store and the NYPD.' Earlier this week, Lee said the company had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures and offered his 'sincere regret and deepest apologies'. 'Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights,' Barneys said in a statement. In his comment piece, Sharpton also highlighted the experiences of 'Treme' actor, Rob Brown, and Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker. Brown claimed he was paraded through . Macy’s Herald Square in handcuffs and placed in a holding cell because . an employee suspected that his credit card didn’t belong to him in June, . Whitaker said he was accused of stealing and patted down after leaving a store in Morningside Heights. 'When international celebrities can be . disrespected and mistreated in such a humiliating manner, how can we . ever naively believe that our work is done?' Sharpton wrote.

"By . James  Nye . Law enforcement on Long Island, New York have confirmed the badly burned body discovered stuffed into a dumpster on Friday is that of the Orthodox Jewish real estate developer kidnapped on Thursday. The body was found in Great Neck with extensive burns and Nassau County police have identified the remains as that of Menachem Stark, 39, who was kidnapped in Brooklyn during the blizzard that hit New York City. This development comes as cops released dramatic surveillance footage that shows the suspects forcing Stark into a Dodge Caravan after he left his offices in Williamsburg late on Thursday evening. Menachem 'Max' Stark (pictured) was murdered and his smoldering body found dumped at a Long Island gas station . Hunt: Police are searching security camera footage for the suspects or car, circled . On Friday the family of Stark, 39, offered a $100,000 'no questions asked' reward for his safe return on Friday, as police combed through surveillance video that appears to show his abduction. Officers say the incident happened at around 11.20pm, when Stark was grabbed by two men on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg. Some reports suggest he was carrying $4,000 in cash. DNA Info . reported that Stark was approached and manhandled into a light-colored . van by two men as he left his office at Southside Associates at 331 . Rutledge Street. His wife . Bashie apparently became concerned when Stark did not return after . midnight and contacted Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the . Orthodox community. Surveillance . footage was then discovered in Stark's office that shows a struggle . with one man, before the van pulls up and he is wrestled by two men into . the vehicle. Investigations: The incident is being looked into by the police and the Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the Orthodox community, who produced this report . Stark's brothers Yitzy and Yoely told the New York Post: 'We saw two people fighting with him, and they put him into a big white van, a Dodge Caravan,' Yitzy, 30, said. The brothers described Menachem's alleged attackers to the Post as 'big' and 'black.' The New York Daily News . reported that Stark was carrying $4,000 in cash, but Yitzy Stark denied . this when he offered the six-figure reward for his brother's return. 'We're . waiting for a phone call with demands. [We're] just hoping that he is . still alive,' Yitzy told DNA Info. 'We'll do anything they ask.' Shomrim . reportedly informed the NYPD of the incident at around 2.30 a.m. on . Friday. Both the police and the community are now looking for clues on . the white Dodge minivan. Officials spent the day in the local area conducting interviews and reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses. Scene: Stark was reportedly grabbed from outside his office on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg, seen in this file photo . The Real Deal . claimed that Stark, and associate Israel Perlmutter, were being sued . more than $51 million in 2011, over loans for development projects in . Williamsburg and Greenpoint. And a number of tenants who claimed to . live in properties owned by Southside Associates have left a number of . angry complaints on sites such as Yelp about the condition and maintenance of the apartments, also describing Stark as a 'slumlord.' One . user wrote: 'These people are absolutely terrible. It's as though they . have no hearts and no compassion for anyone else. All they seem to care . about is their bank account.' Yitzy . Stark described his brother to the Daily News as 'a good man, a great . man.' 'Nobody around here would say anything bad about him,' he added.","Menachem Stark, 39, who was kidnapped outside his Brooklyn office has apparently been found dead in a dumpster in Long Island .

She . said she was forced to drink to help her survive ‘an awful lot of . boring parties’ she and Mr Bercow attend with people who had ‘their . heads up their arses’. And she admitted that her husband  might never . have married her if he had known he was going to have such a . high-profile Westminster role because ‘he’d have seen trouble ahead’. With . a touch of melodrama,  she added: ‘But what should I do? Divorce the . man I love?

"By . Sam Creighton . On a gloriously sunny day, lazily sailing down the Thames in your own luxury boat is a lifestyle most people can only dream of. But for the would-be captain of a £1 million boat, it all went wrong when he forgot a cardinal maritime rule - always look where you are going. A Princess V57, called Victoria, gave sunbathers a shock this afternoon by careering straight into Richmond Bridge in west London. Scroll down for video . The luxury yacht was trying to drive under Richmond Bridge but high tides made the manoeuvre difficult . The crash happened just before 4pm this afternoon. According to the Port of London Authority (PLA), the boat - which retails for over the £1 million mark - miraculously came out of the accident without any real damage. Also, none of the passengers were injured. A spokesman for the PLA said: 'At about 15.49 she was coming under Richmond Road Bridge and struck the side, she seems to have reversed her engines and attempted the manouevre again successfully. More... That's no way to park! Driver smashes through fence and flips his Ford Fiesta to land upside down in a back garden - but manages to CRAWL out unscathed . House obliterated by pensioner, 72, who rammed her SKODA into neighbour's home . 'When a boat like this reverses, the engines can make quite a loud noise, so people might have thought it was more dramatic than it was. 'I think it was just a family day out, the only thing remarkable about it is that the weather was lovely, so everyone and their dog was out to see it. As far as I understand it was all over in a couple of minutes.' Caroline Fisher, 45, who witnessed the incident from her home by the bridge, said: 'It was really bizarre. I saw this big boat coming towards the bridge and just thought it was not going to fit through. 'There was just this big bang and then it seemed to be doing some sort of three point turn and there was another really loud bang. I thought some of the other boats around might have gone to help it but it just sat there for about ten minutes and then it went under the bridge and everyone started cheering. 'I'm sure it probably wasn't but it seemed like it was out of control. I was taking loads of pictures when it sailed by me but I couldn't really see any damage.' A RNLI lifeboat was called out to deal with the incident but, by the time it arrived, the yacht was already through the bridge and was continuing with its journey. A large crowd gathered after the crash, at 4pm this afternoon, to watch the boat eventually make it under . The Port of London Authority said the privately owned boat escaped the incident without any real damage . Water levels were higher than expected, and strong currents are thought to be partly responsible for the crash . An RNLI spokesman said: 'An RNLI London lifeboat crew was called to a . report of a motor vessel pinned against Richmond Bridge by the tide this . afternoon. 'Before the crew from Chiswick lifeboat station arrived, the vessel . had managed to get itself free and had begun travelling down river. 'The lifeboat met the troubled vessel near Twickenham Bridge and noticed it had suffered some scratches on the starboard side. 'The . lifeboat crew spoke to a person on-board who said everything was now ok . and that the vessel was heading to a nearby wharf down river.' The . boat is thought to have been dragged towards the bridge by the river's . currents and became stuck under its arch due to high water levels. The accident occurred just after high tide and the water levels were running almost a metre higher than would normally be expected, meaning the flow was particularly fierce. This is because of an ongoing situation where the flood waters than have struck so much of England in recent weeks are flowing out to sea along the Thames. A spokesman for the PLA said: 'It's wrong to speculate too much on this incident but it's quite conceivable that the driver would have been coming up to the bridge expecting a certain strength of current and could have been caught unawares.' The boat, a Princess V57, retails for upwards of £1 million is capable of reaching speeds of 36 knots . The yacht was able to reverse and make it under the bridge on the second attempt . Although the incident only lasted minutes, the sunny weather meant large crowds were out to witness it . The passengers on the yacht were later met by lifeguards but no assistance was needed .","A Princess V57 yacht, worth more than £1million, crashed into the bridge .

"By . Amanda Williams . GPs have admitted letting receptionists act as 'telephone triage' to decide which patients get urgent appointments, according to a new survey . GPs have admitted letting receptionists act as 'telephone triage' to decide which patients get urgent appointments, according to a new survey. One in eight practices admitted using the untrained practice staff to determine who needs to be seen first and who can wait. While most surgeries use such triage systems - which help ensure those who are most in need are prioritised - the decision is usually made by clinically trained staff who have been taught to recognise the key signals or alarm bells. The survey of 1200 GPs, nurses and practice managers revealed that 13 per cent of surgeries allowed receptionists to take the decision - sometimes with no input from a professional medical senior, the Telegraph reports. The survey was carried out by Campden Health, a clinical research and publishing company. It also found that almost half of GP practices who use 'phone triage' did not give their staff training in how to identify . serious symptoms, which required urgent care. It comes as doctors said they were wasting time seeing patients who did not need an appointment. They told researchers that six patients a day were taking up appointments at the average family practice, who could have been treated elsewhere or at home. Campden Health estimated the time wasters cost the NHS Â£1billion a year across almost 64,000 UK GPs practices. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association told the paper she was deeply concerned about the rising trend which she said was 'becoming more widespread.' She added:'Patients' lives are put at risk by decisions to cut costs in this kind of way; there is a huge risk of symptoms being missed when the assessment is being made by an un-trained person who can't even see the patient.' GPs told researchers that six patients a day were taking up appointments at the average family practice, who could have been treated elsewhere or at home . Dr Chaand . Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee added that receptionists should never be asked to . take on responsibilities requiring clinical judgement. Examples of patients who did not need appointments were those with minor ailments, and those seeking antibiotics needlessly and requesting repeat prescriptions, which can be arranged by clerical staff.","Survey of GPs, nurses and practice managers run by Campden Health .

"By . Tamara Cohen . The body of Tony Benn will rest overnight in Parliament’s chapel before his funeral – an honour only previously given to Baroness Thatcher. The veteran Labour MP will be given the controversial tribute because he had the ‘almost unique distinction’ of the freedom of the House. The Queen gave permission for the move yesterday after it was suggested by Speaker John Bercow to the Benn family, who said they were ‘deeply touched’. The body of Tony Benn (left) will rest overnight in Parliament’s chapel before his funeral – an honour only previously given to Baroness Thatcher (right) Former cabinet minister and campaigner Mr Benn, who died last week aged 88, will now lie in the chapel of St Mary Undercroft on Wednesday night so MPs, peers and parliamentary staff can pay their respects. However, the move has attracted criticism from both Labour and Conservative MPs who last night said the achievements of Mr Benn and Lady Thatcher were ‘not comparable’. Tory MP Rob Wilson, an aide to the Chancellor, said: ‘This is an error of judgment from the Speaker. Margaret Thatcher was Britain’s first female prime minister, she came from an  ordinary background to hold that office and dominate British politics for over a decade. ‘Even her fiercest opponents do not dispute that she made a huge impact. By contrast, Tony Benn was the son of a hereditary peer whose politics and views were not just rejected by the public but by his own party over two decades before he left Parliament. The coffin of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher resting in the Crypt Chapel of St Mary Undercroft beneath the Houses of Parliament in central London . ‘The achievement and significance of the two are hardly comparable. Longevity doesn’t equal significance and sentimental gestures such as this risk demeaning and degrading parliament and its traditions.’ One Labour MP said there was ‘unease’ among some in the party at the decision, saying: ‘You don’t wish to speak ill of the dead, but clearly there is no equivalence with Mrs Thatcher – she won three general elections.’ Another Labour MP said: ‘He never held a great office of state and he almost destroyed the Labour Party.’ Former Conservative party chairman Lord Tebbit said it ‘made parliament look rather silly’ given Mr Benn’s antipathy to the House of Lords. He renounced his hereditary peerage to remain as an MP. The move has attracted criticism from MPs who said the achievements of Mr Benn and Lady Thatcher (pictured) were 'not comparable' The peer added: ‘I’m at a loss to know why it’s thought he should be accorded this honour, rather than many who have achieved far more. ‘One can think of people like Alec Douglas-Home, as an obvious example, not to mention Earl Attlee. After all, Benn was an opponent of one of the components of parliament, the House of Lords. It seems quite extraordinary.’ Mr Benn became an MP in 1950, and won 16 elections, serving in the cabinets of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 70s. During the political battles of the 1980s, he ran unsuccessfully for the deputy leadership of the party, and was seen as the voice of the hard Left. After standing down as MP in 2001, he became an influential campaigner against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of his four children is Hilary Benn, 60, a Labour MP in the shadow cabinet. The Speaker’s office yesterday said the decision to let his body rest overnight recognised his more than 50 years as an MP. After Edward Heath, he is one of only two MPs to be awarded the freedom of the House in honour of his ‘very long and distinguished service’. ‘It is this almost unique distinction which forms the basis for Tony Benn to be accorded the privilege to ‘rest’ in the Chapel on the eve of his funeral,’ said  a spokesman. The Queen’s permission was sought by The House of Lords official Black Rod because the chapel is part of the royal estate.Both Ed Miliband and David Cameron paid tribute to Mr Benn’s achievements at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday. The Prime Minister said: ‘He was a magnificent writer, speaker, diarist and campaigner, with a strong record of public and political service.’ The coffin of Baroness Thatcher is taken into the chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster . A spokesman for the Benn  family said: ‘The family were deeply touched by the Speaker’s suggestion and would like to thank all those who have made it possible for their father to spend his last night in Parliament.’ The funeral will take place at St Margaret’s Church, between Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. It will not be a ceremonial affair like Lady Thatcher’s but a number of  public tickets will be available. The Speaker’s chaplain, the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, has agreed to keep a vigil beside the body through the night. Lady Thatcher’s coffin was placed in the chapel following her death in line with her wishes. The site is alongside Westminster Hall, a location for state funerals, and a short service took place before her funeral last year.","Veteran MP had 'almost unique distinction' of the freedom of the House .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Joanna Trollope, 70, pictured with partner Jason Kouchak, 39, has said that, at her age, trust is more important than fidelity in relationships . She has found fame and fortune turning her tales of tangled middle-class relationships into best-selling novels. And it transpires that Joanna Trollope’s life is also far from straightforward. For at 70 the best-selling author has revealed she has taken the unusual and deliberate step of not setting up home with her toyboy partner of 12 years as she prefers the freedom that comes with living alone. Confessing she has an ‘unorthodox’ relationship with musician Jason Kouchak, 39, she also alluded to the fact that it has survived for as long as it has because she has a relaxed attitude to being monogamous - as she is no longer able to have children. Asked if fidelity is important to her, twice-married Miss Trollope who has made more than £15million from a string of novels that have seen her dubbed Queen of the Aga Saga, replied: ‘You know, I think at my age, loyalty and trust are more important than monogamy, but I think while women are fertile, sexual loyalty is crucial. But as time goes on you shrug a bit.’ Miss Trollope, the Oxford-educated daughter of a rector and distant relative of Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope, has two daughters by her first husband and two step-sons from her second marriage. Her first marriage to City banker David Potter lasted for 18 years and the second to television dramatist Ian Curteis ended after 15 years. In the interview for West Country Life Miss Trollope reveals both men were threatened by her success. She said: ‘I don’t think either of my husbands were entirely comfortable with any success I had – it made them uneasy. And I’m not going to elaborate on that.’ Asked if her success had affected her marriages, she said: ‘There was some threat involved somewhere, because all human relationships are about control of one kind or another. 'Who knows at what point an idea of control segues into a fear of not having enough.’ Miss Trollope has been with the same partner for around 12 of the 15 years she has lived alone and enjoys keeping it that way as her liberty now takes priority. Joanna Trollope pictured with her second husband Ian Curteis who she was married to for 15 years . She said: ‘Independence is crucially important to me but it doesn’t extend to wanting to control other people. I just want to be free myself. 'He’s [Kouchak] never been married. I think it’s the right degree of liberty for both of us and I’d never consider living with somebody again. 'I don’t want anyone to say to me, ‘Why can’t I see you this weekend? Why are you going to be with the grandchildren?’ In researching her new book Balancing Act, which is about the new breed of wealthy working women, Miss Trollope went to Stoke-on-Trent, home of Emma Bridgewater pottery, on which she bases the fictional firm in her novel. She also spoke to successful women and discovered ‘very few of them were with men who couldn’t handle their success.’ In Balancing Act, one of the characters happily becomes a house husband looking after their children while his ambitious wife follows her dreams. Miss Trollope said it is a scenario she sees as increasingly becoming the norm. She said: ‘This ""men are from Mars, women are from Venus"" approach is infinitely too black and white. 'There are vast numbers of men who aren’t thugs and brutes, but who are nurturing, cosseting people. I also think a lot of men are truly interested in the upbringing of their children.' The shift between the last few generations has been massive, she points out. 'The father of my children still proudly boasts that he’s never changed a nappy. I don’t think that’s anything to be proud of.'","Joanna Trollope has made millions with novels about middle-class affairs .

"PUBLISHED: . 09:05 EST, 27 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:40 EST, 28 October 2013 . The New York Stock Exchange . on Saturday did a test run of Twitter's highly anticipated market debut. The NYSE wants to avoid the types of problems that plagued Facebook's . initial public offering in 2012 on rival Nasdaq. The Big Board, run by NYSE Euronext, regularly does systems testing on the weekends, but this was the first time it had run a simulated IPO, and it did so at the request of its member firms - many of whom took part in Facebook's IPO on Nasdaq OMX Group's main exchange. Twitter Inc is marching towards this year's most anticipated initial public offering in the U.S., and is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in mid-November. The NYSE was testing mainly for two things: To see if its systems could handle the amount of message traffic that might be generated by the IPO; and to make sure that once the IPO took place any firms that placed orders would promptly receive the reports telling them that their orders had been executed.It can also be seen as part of NYSE's struggle with Nasdaq for supremacy in technology listings. Both exchanges vied to be home to Twitter's stock, and many analysts said the trading disruptions that occurred on Facebook's Nasdaq debut likely played to NYSE's favor, as it tries to become the destination of choice for technology listings, something Nasdaq once dominated.Twitter, which intends to sell 70 million shares at between $17 and $20 each, will be holding the biggest Internet IPO since Facebook, which sold a much larger 421 million shares at $38 each. Twitter is expected to start trading as early as November 7. In the case of Facebook, the tremendous volume of orders on the first day of trading exposed a glitch in Nasdaq's system, ultimately preventing timely order confirmations for many traders, leaving them unsure about their exposure for hours, and in some cases for days afterwards. Major market makers estimated they lost collectively up to $500 million in the IPO.The absence of Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld while the meltdown was occurring magnified the criticism toward the exchange - he had been celebrating the debut at Facebook's California headquarters before jumping on a plane back to New York. The New York Stock Exchange  did a test run of Twitter's highly anticipated market debut, as it seeks to avoid the types of problems that plagued Facebook's initial public offering on rival Nasdaq. Nasdaq was fined $10 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission - the largest fine ever for an exchange - and said it would voluntarily pay up to $62 million to compensate firms that had been harmed. On Friday, Nasdaq said $41.6 million of claims put forward qualified for the compensation plan.The chaotic debut also contributed to a decline in Facebook's stock. The stock hit a low of $17.55 in August, though it has since more than recovered the losses, closing on Friday at $51.95, well above its IPO price.While Nasdaq had tested its systems in the lead-up to the IPO, allowing member firms to place dummy orders to a test symbol over a specific period, it limited the total number of orders that could be received in the simulation to 40,000. On the day of the IPO, over 496,000 orders were placed before the IPO opened, with around 82 million shares traded. By the end of the day, more than 500 million shares had traded hands, a record for an IPO.NYSE's tests on Saturday ran hundreds of thousands of orders, with one single firm placing an order at one point for nearly 81 million shares.""This morning's systems test was successful, and we're grateful to all the firms that chose to participate,"" an NYSE spokesman said. ""We are being very methodical in our planning for Twitter's IPO, and are working together with the industry to ensure a world-class experience for Twitter, retail investors and all market participants.""THREE TEST IPOSOn an average trading day, there are around 700 people on the floor of the Big Board dressed in business suits, many also wearing blue jackets with their firms' names emblazoned on them.On Saturday, about 20 people - floor operators, technicians, and designated market makers, who are akin to air traffic controllers for stocks, overseeing trading and ensuring fair and orderly markets - gathered in small groups around various screens, dressed in jeans and sipping coffees.At 7 a.m., just as they would for an actual IPO, over 20 NYSE member firms began sending in their orders for the Twitter IPO simulation. The market opened up as it normally would at 9:30 a.m., but in this case using data from Friday to recreate a normal environment with 3,800 listed stock trading. IPO orders kept coming in and NYSE had a phone line open to keep members apprised of the situation and to answer questions.Shortly before 10 a.m., the first of three test IPOs to mimic the Twitter debut took place, using the symbol IPOA.The designated market maker (DMM), in this case a representative from Barclays, ran the auction, with orders coming in electronically on a screen and from brokers on the floor using hand-held computers.A major difference between NYSE's system and Nasdaq's is that Nasdaq's is fully electronic, while NYSE's normal IPO procedures include human intervention, through the DMM.Once a price had been determined, based on the orders that had come in, and following communication with the investment bankers and brokers, the DMM froze the order book and hit a blue ""DONE"" button on his keyboard. Immediately after, alerts went off on the brokers' handheld devices indicating their orders had been executed.A NYSE employee on the floor wearing a Bluetooth earpiece, who was connected to the call with member firms, called out the action as it happened.The exercise was completed two more times, using test symbols IPOB and IPOC, with KCG Holdings and Goldman Sachs as DMMs, and with saws and drills buzzing in the background from weekend renovations, instead of the usual din of traders.Both NYSE and Nasdaq have said 2013 is shaping up to be their best IPO year in more than half a decade.","Twitter is this year's most anticipated initial public offering in the U.S.

"By . Dan Bloom . Guilty: Fatimah Ahmed, pictured at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, has quit her job . A maths teacher has avoided jail for hiding £7,000 of her husband's drug money in her bank account. Fatimah Ahmed, 30, was arrested after police found cocaine and cannabis worth up to £6,000 in a raid on the home she shared with Mohazzam Ali in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The scandal cost her her job at Poynton High School, Cheshire. Police raided the house in November 2011 after they learned Ali - who has admitted five drugs offences - was dealing Class A drugs while running a car wash. Officers seized large quantities of snap bags, digital scales, . grinders and about £600 in cash. Ali's then-girlfriend Ahmed, who has since married and had a child with him, was initially charged with drug dealing and suspended from her job at Poynton High School. She then resigned in December last year during a disciplinary hearing. It emerged Ahmed had been teaching . despite being convicted of three thefts, for which she received a conditional discharge in 2003. But prosecutors dropped charges of drug dealing against her after accepting her guilty plea to laundering £7,000. Ahmed was given 18 weeks' jail suspended for two years - after a judge told her to 'go back' and look after her and Ali’s baby daughter. Prosecutor Saul Brody told Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court: 'The address was a property owned by this defendant and her then boyfriend and now husband. 'There was a strong smell of cannabis when they attended. It is fair to say that the usual paraphernalia was discovered in various locations around the house - two bedrooms and the living room. 'There were also a variety of controlled drugs of various classes. There was cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy-type substances. The total value of the drugs was about £4-6,000. 'At that stage both were arrested and charged with drug matters. The evidence on drugs matters in relation to this defendant was not compelling but evidence relating to the financial aspect is as her bank account shows unidentified payments on a fairly significant basis. Partners in crime: The court heard Mohazzam Ali (left) was the 'drugs person' and Ahmed (right) was the 'money person'. She pleaded guilty but said she did not know the £7,000 in her account had come from crime . 'The husband is the drugs person and she is the money person... She may have believed that at some stage there were legitimate payments.' Michael Knowles, defending, said Ahmed did not know the money had been criminal property. However, she pleaded guilty to one count of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property between November 2010 to February 2013. Her husband pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of class A-C drugs with intent to . supply and then three counts of possession. He is due to be sentenced next month. She now faces a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing in June to confiscate the money. Judge Bernard Lever told Ahmed: 'You on your basis of plea of suspicion rather than knowledge allowed £7,000 to go through your bank account at the behest of your husband and father of your little baby child. 'This was 2011 and you have had to come to court many times. You have pleaded following an indication of a suspended sentence. Career: Ahmed, 30, taught maths at Poynton High School in Cheshire. She quit during a disciplinary hearing . 'In these circumstances everyone agrees that the appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment which you won’t have to serve if you don’t commit further offences. 'You have limited antecedents and have a young baby. Go home and look after your small baby. Keep out of trouble.' Poynton High head teacher David Waugh said: 'Fatimah Ahmed was suspended from duty following her arrest in November 2011, pending the outcome of the police investigation and legal proceedings. 'She later resigned from her post at the school, in December 2013, during a disciplinary hearing which was being conducted. 'Miss Ahmed’s conduct has brought . disgrace on herself and besmirched the good reputation and high . integrity of the teaching profession' - Poynton High head David Waugh . 'Miss Ahmed’s conduct has brought disgrace on herself and besmirched the good reputation and high integrity of the teaching profession. 'Following thorough investigations by the police, school and Local Authority, we are totally confident that the offences were entirely unrelated to the school, its students and the Poynton community and that there are no issues, nor have their ever been, with regard to the health, safety and welfare of our students and staff. 'The school has worked very closely with the support of Cheshire East Council’s human resources team, its legal department and the Local Authority Designated Officer throughout these investigations and legal proceedings. 'Our recent Ofsted inspection also praised Poynton High School unequivocally on safeguarding and protecting the welfare of our students. 'The Ofsted report said that ‘leaders in school are proactive in ensuring that safeguarding measures are strong. Staff work extremely well with parents and outside agencies to make sure students’ welfare needs are met’. 'It also said that ‘substantial evidence provided by the headteacher’ demonstrates that the school has robust systems and procedures which contribute strongly to helping its students stay safe’. 'This school, its staff and governors remain committed to ensuring this ethos is maintained and strengthened. Protecting the welfare of our pupils and helping them achieve their potential is at the core of all that we do.'","Fatimah Ahmed, 30, concealed £7,000 for her husband Mohazzam Ali, 36 .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . A firefighter thought he could solve his dental problems without spending a fortune by having surgery in Budapest. But the money he saved ended up causing more trouble than it was worth after his teeth began to fall out following a botched operation. Stephen Carter, 53, needed dentures due to decades of drinking fizzy drinks and a fear of the dentist that meant he delayed getting his decaying teeth fixed. Smiling again: Stephen Carter has finally got adequate dentures after first wasting money on botched surgery abroad . He then got into a play fight at work that caused his false teeth to break, leaving him with just five teeth. The firefighter admits his toothless smile left him self-conscious about his appearance. He said: 'I didn't smile as much as I used to. I used to have a nice smile in my younger days.' His girlfriend, Sarah Groves, added: 'He became quite withdrawn with it, he didn't want to speak out loud with it. He became very conscious of his teeth all the time.' The firefighter had just five teeth and dentures he had fitted in Budapest kept breaking and falling out . Stephen lived with the problem for two years as he investigated how it could be solved. He couldn't afford to have the surgery in Britain so he looked at having it done aboard and discovered it would cost half as much. He recalled: 'The prices in Britain were between £16,000 and £21,000 which I thought was a lot of money. 'I found a surgery in Budapest that offered cheap implants and free accommodation. It took me a long time to actually decide to go for it. They offered me a discount of £500 if I paid in cash.' He opted for a fixed palate with a lifetime guarantee which cost £6,500 upfront in cash. 'Over the last 10 years, we're seeing more . and more the results of disasters which are emanating from cosmetic . surgery tourism' Stephen said: 'The teeth were actually taken out in London and then I went to Budapest for surgery. It was very professional, and it all looked very clean, very hygienic. Immediately afterwards my teeth were good, strong and I had a nice smile.' However three months later, he was horrified when one of the teeth broke off completely when he munched a chocolate bar. 'I bit into a Mars bar and thought, this is a bit crunchy, this Mars bar. I pulled the bit out and it was a bit of tooth,' he said. He contacted the company in Budapest and was given a replacement tooth but three weeks later, another one fell out and then yet another. Soon the whole bridge holding his teeth snapped. Even though he had a 'lifetime guarantee' he was told he would have to return to Hungary at his own cost to have a replacement, which he would also have to pay for. Sweet tooth: Eating a Mars bar caused Stephen's teeth to come out after he had botched surgery . The replacement eventually snapped too and Stephen was left worse off than he was before and down £10,000. When he complained, he was only given a 25 per cent refund. Patrick Mallucci, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon based in the UK, said Stephen is one of many victims of inadequate and unscrupulous surgeons who tempt Brits aboard with discount deals. He said: 'Over the last 10 years, we're seeing more . and more the results of disasters which are emanating from cosmetic . surgery tourism.' An exasperated Stephen said he now didn't know what to do: 'I'd like a nice set of teeth. I'd . like to be able to properly smile again with confidence, to properly eat . again. It would mean the world to me to have my teeth fixed.' His salvation finally came after he appeared on Channel 5 show Botched Up Bodies: Aboard and was given the teeth he'd always wanted by cosmetics surgeon Dr Adam Slade. Delighted with the results, he said: 'I think I've got an excellent smile now. My teeth fit together when I bite - there's no rocking or anything. I'm really, really impressed! It's made me good-looking again.' Catch up on Botched Up Bodies: Aboard on Channel 5 On Demand.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Lt. Col. David John Wood MBE, arriving at Bristol Civil Justice Centre . A decorated SAS hero, a landowner, and aLiberal Democrat peer are embroiled in a bitter High Court battle - over a 500 yard piece of muddy land. Former Lieutenant Colonel David Wood, 52, claims he was granted a right of way over a quarter of a mile long track when he bought his £3.25million country home from Lib Dem peer Lord Sharman four years ago. The 500-yard strip allows horse riders using his commercial livery yard to reach a nearby bridleway where they can hack over the Wiltshire countryside. Mr Wood says he bought the land believing that it came with the access rights. But the owner of the land, Edward . Waddington, 46, claims he has no such rights, and has now erected locked . gates to keep people out. He claims riders from the livery centre, created by Mr Wood, are disturbing game birds he keeps, and fears it could put an end to a renowned annual shoot he hosts. The move has forced Mr Wood to re-direct horse riders across muddy fields from the stables he built around his home. He is also unable to drive vehicles to reach a vital road which runs alongside the properties. The bitter dispute is now before the High Court, sitting in Bristol, where a judge heard Mr Wood believed the right of way came as part of buying his home. Mr Wood told the court: 'I want my access uninterrupted. I have a right of way granted to me by my predecessor which required me access to those areas. 'Mr Waddington told me it was his right to put the gates on the lane and he was ‘forced to take defensive action’. 'He said he wanted to make it absolutely clear that he ""will continue to protect my rights"".' The court heard how the land in question near Salisbury, Wiltshire, was originally part of some put up for sale in 1998 for a total of £7 million. Mr Wood claims he was granted right of way over the rack when he bought his home from Lib Dem peer Lord Sharman (left) four years ago. But the land owner, Edward . Waddington (right), 46, claims he has no such right . But when a sale fell through it was separated into lots, three of which were bought by Lord Sharman and turned into his home, the 35-acre Manor Farm. The fourth parcel of land was snapped up by Mr Waddington, who moved into the property included in the sale. Lord Sharman claims Manor Farm had access rights to nearby bridleways - despite the fact he had to cross his neighbour’s land to reach them. He told the court: 'I was clear during the whole time I was there I enjoyed a right of access at all times for all purposes. 'Mr Waddington and I didn’t discuss boundaries and details at any time, we had a good relationship, we got on. 'When I wanted to deepen a trench for flood defences [on his land] I didn’t feel the need to go to him to ask. 'Using the route was convenient for me and I did it from time to time.' In 2009 Lord Sharman sold his property, alongside the presumed rights, to Mr Wood, who immediately began building a menage on the stables he had been left. Lieutenant Colonel David Wood - who lives and works at Manor Farm Liivery (RED) and Edward Waddington - who lives next door, Field Barn Farmhouse, (BLUE).  The lane marked in yellow is the disputed land/access . But Mr Waddington took immediate exception to the new construction, complaining about its size and the noise it would generate. 'I don’t object to horses disturbing my shoot,' he told the court. 'I would like to try and keep the horses down to a sensible number but obviously there are horses in the village and this new menage is clearly a growing business. 'Had there been an established livery or equestrian centre I would not have considered buying, there was no mention of horses during negotiations. Mr Waddington, 46, has now erected locked gates to keep people out. He claims riders from the livery centre, created by Mr Wood, are disturbing game birds he keeps, and fears it could put an end to a renowned annual shoot he hosts (pictured is the land in dispute) The move has forced Mr Wood to re-direct horse riders across muddy fields from the stables he built around his home . Col Wood's home and business. Despite not owning the land the veteran claims he was given a right of way to freely come and go when he purchased his house from Lib Dem peer Lord Sharman, four years ago . Edward Waddington's home. He believes a popular livery centre, created by Mr Wood, is disturbing game birds he keeps and will ultimately put an end to a renowned partridge and pheasant shoot he hosts annually . 'Technically Lord Sharman was trespassing when he drove his vehicles down that lane but we have always got on and there has never been an issue.' The dispute continued and in January 2012 the disgruntled neighbour claimed builders had altered his land to make way for the building. In a letter sent to Mr Wood’s solicitors he wrote: 'Following the meeting with your client I took advice from my solicitor and the land in which your client has constructed his new track appears to belong to me.' When Mr Wood disputed this, the farmer began to build gates and warned the former soldier he would 'continue to protect my land'. The court heard Mr Waddington claims riders from the Manor Farm Livery could put an end to the famous Teffont Magna shoot he has spent 15 years creating. He believes sportsmen, paying nearly £1,000 a day to shoot partridge and pheasant on his land, would be forced to hold fire every time a horse rode by. The four-day court case in front of Mr Justice Morgan is expected to end today.

"By . Daniel Martin . and Mark Duell . Tony Benn’s body could be allowed to lie overnight in a Palace of Westminster chapel, it emerged last night. The Queen has been asked to approve the unusual tribute following the intervention of Commons Speaker John Bercow. The only politician to have been accorded the honour was Margaret Thatcher, before her ceremonial funeral last April. Unusual tribute: The body of Tony Benn (left) could be allowed to lie overnight in a Palace of Westminster chapel. The only politician to have been accorded the honour was Margaret Thatcher (right) last year . Honour: The coffin of Baroness Thatcher rests in the Crypt Chapel of St Mary Undercroft beneath the Houses of Parliament in Central London on the day before her ceremonial funeral last April . Mr Benn, who died last week aged 88, won more elections than any Labour MP – 16 – and was a Cabinet minister in the 1960s and 1970s. His family said last night that the idea had come from the office of the Speaker of the House of Commons. It also has the support of the Lords Speaker, and the request was put to Her Majesty by Black Rod, a senior Parliamentary official. The former Cabinet minister is one of only two politicians - along with former Tory prime minister Edward Heath - to be awarded the Freedom of the House in recognition of his long years of service. Remembered: The coffin bearing the body of Baroness Thatcher at St Paul's Cathedral in London during her funeral service last April . Request: The Queen (left) has been asked to approve the unusual tribute following the intervention of Commons Speaker John Bercow (right) A book of condolence has been opened for Tony Benn in Parliament and MPs will have the opportunity to pay personal tributes in the Commons tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband will be given a chance to pay tribute today. Mr Benn became MP for Bristol South East in 1950 - however, he was prevented from being an MP when he became the second Viscount Stansgate, after his father's death in 1960. But he fought to change the law and was the first to renounce his peerage, which was crucial in the creation of the Peerage Act in 1963. He retired from the Commons in 2001. A spokesman for the Benn family said: ‘At the suggestion of the Speaker and by agreement with the Lords Speaker, Black Rod and the Dean of Westminster Abbey, an approach has been made by Black Rod to the Palace for agreement that Mr Benn’s body rest in the chapel of St Mary’s Undercroft on the night before his funeral.’ If permission is granted, his body would arrive in the chapel on the evening of March 26, before his funeral in St Margaret’s Church opposite Parliament the following day. A short service would be held after the arrival of Mr Benn’s body in the chapel. The Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Chaplain to the Speaker, has agreed to watch over his body through the night should permission be granted. The only other politician granted the honour was Baroness Thatcher last year.","Queen is asked to approve tribute following John Bercow's intervention .

Pickett posed as Chef Keith Guerke, author of Leftover's Right: Making a Winner of Last Night's Dinner on segments shot for Milwaukee, Rhinelander, and Wausau, and Rockford, Illinois audiences over Thanksgiving and Christmastime last year. Perhaps most revolting was the leftovers smoothie concoction that featured ham, pie and gravy. 'You can use skim for a heart healthy menu,' said Chef Guerke says. In one of the smoothie gags, he even managed to get the host to take a drink.

Luckily she didn't end up wearing the smoothie, as well . He got another host to try his 'ants on a leg,' which was a chicken drumstick slathered in mashed potatoes and cranberries. And for another segment, one the host said was just 'too cute,' he substituted mashed potatoes for ice cream. 'Mashed potatoes: boring, right? how about a mashed potato ice cream cone,' he laughs. 'Put on your corn sprinkles and don't forget your cranberry cherry on top!' This is not the first time Pickett has tricked local newscasters who've failed to properly vet their guests.

Touts have scammed football fans out of hundreds of pounds by passing off free tickets for a Hillsborough disaster memorial service as tickets for a game between Liverpool and Swansea. The tickets were tampered with to make them look like they granted entry for last Sunday's fixture and sold for up to £100. But fans were left disappointed when they found they had actually been sold free tickets issued for a memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 people died.

"By . Mike Dickson . The look in his eyes and the emotional tone to his voice tells you the extent of the pain Andy Murray feels about the ending of his history-making partnership with Ivan Lendl. The Wimbledon champion described himself as ‘gutted’ that they will no longer be working together, after deciding they could not go on with an arrangement that was in danger of becoming ‘half-baked’. In his first interview about the split, Murray last night revealed the pain he felt when a dinner with his mentor on Saturday evening to discuss how they might move forward turned into their last supper. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Murray's journey under Lendl . Gutted: Andy Murray has revealed how his split with coach Ivan Lendl has hurt him deeply . Separate ways: Murray (L) and Lendl decided to end their relationship for fear it could become 'half-baked' Watchful eye: Lendl (R) and Murray have worked together since 31 December 2011 . At the Australian Open in January, the  26-year-old compared the start of a player-coach relationship to having a new girlfriend: you might do everything you can to impress them in the first few months but let some effort slip when things become more familiar. To extend that analogy, it is clear that breaking up has also been very hard to do. The British No 1 appears to be suffering a degree of inner  turmoil but that is hardly surprising when he has parted with someone who has changed his life. ‘That night it was tough,’ said Murray. ‘He was a big part of my life. We chatted for an hour about other stuff, then we chatted about moving forward. ‘The next couple of days for me on the court after that were not  particularly fun, but he is going to come and watch my matches here. I was gutted but I still think the guy is great. It’s not like anything has changed there. I will be disappointed for a few weeks but I need to try to move on.’ Love game: Murray has compared his relationship with player-coach Lendl to that of having a new girlfriend . Great Scot: Murray insists that he will move on after the disappointment of losing a coach and friend . Mentor: Lendl is still expected to be in Murray's box when he plays his first round at the Sony Open . Slightly strangely, Lendl is expected to be in Murray’s player box tonight when the Scot takes on Australian Matthew Ebden in the second round of the Sony Open in what will be his first match since that fateful dinner last Saturday. It is clear the situation with Lendl has been troubling him for some time, with Murray wanting more time from the 54-year-old Czech than he felt able, or willing, to give. ‘When there’s a chance that something like that might not work out, or maybe something is going on, it can be in the back of your head,’ the Scot conceded. ‘Maybe thinking about these kind of things for a couple of months can throw you off a little. ‘We planned to sit down when I got to Miami to discuss moving forward, but it wasn’t going to happen. He is a very hard person to replace, he made a huge difference to my tennis. The thing he was brought in to do was to help get me over the line and that’s what he did.’ Breakthrough: Under Lendl's guidance, Murray won his first major event by taking gold at London 2012 . Grand slam dunk! Murray went on to win his first major at the 2012 US Open under Lendl . It is absolutely clear that Murray did not want it to end. He revealed that their agreement was for Lendl to do 25 weeks per year with him in the first year, going down to 20 in the second. It was going to be less in 2014, and he felt that was not enough. ‘Ivan completely understands that as well,’ said Murray. ‘And that was why we decided to stop working together because it wasn’t going to be of benefit to anyone doing the job half-baked. That’s what Ivan’s like. He will do things properly, he doesn’t want to do it halfway.’ Murray sounds somewhat down in the dumps. It is hardly what he needs as he prepares to defend his title here and the large haul of ranking points that goes with it, with the chance of dropping to No 8 if it does not go well. SW19: Murray celebrates after becoming the first British player to win Wimbledon for 77 years . The wait is over: Murray finally laid Fred Perry's ghost to rest after beating Novak Djokovic in the final . Stairway to heaven: Murray clambers up the stands to celebrate with Lendl after winning Wimbledon . He conceded that he has not played as well over the past six weeks as he did at the Australian Open, even though in Melbourne he did not feel ‘physically quite there yet’ after back surgery in late September. There was also the admission that he has just been through a tough week in Indian Wells, and that his overall form has been patchy of late. ‘Who knows? Maybe it is the spark that I need,’ said Murray, putting a brave face on things. ‘I have been in worse situations before and turned them around. I can see myself turning this around at some stage in the next couple of months. I know I will get myself up and play my best tennis in the Slams, I think my record in the last few years suggests that will happen.’ Slow beginnings: Lendl and Murray are the only players to have lost their first four Grand Slam finals . Next? Murray has hinted that he would like to bring in another former big-nam player to be his coach . It sounds as though Murray, having enjoyed such success with Lendl, would like another big-hitter who has experience of winning a Grand Slam, but he is also aware that they are in short supply, especially those who are willing to spend weeks and months away. He stated that he intends to try and appoint a replacement before the French Open begins in late May. ‘It’s a possibility for sure, but again the situation has to work for everybody and there aren’t that many guys willing to travel and make sacrifices,’ he said. ‘I don’t want to rush it, this has to be for the medium to long term.’ At least Murray is not the only one with coach issues — Boris Becker will be absent from Novak Djokovic’s camp again because he has had to have more surgery on both his hips.","Andy Murray and Ivan Lendl have ended their player-coach relationship .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . After thousands of people rallied to help a Connecticut woman find her two lost dogs, city officials have put the kibosh on an important tool in her search: The thousands of 'lost dogs' posters posted on city property. Amanda Denes returned home from work on February 27, to find her home ransacked and her two French bulldog-schnauzer mixes - Burton and Zuzu - missing. Denes took to social media in her search for her missing mutts, starting a Facebook page that quickly gained thousands of 'likes.' Missing: Amanda Denes lost her two dogs - Burton and Zuzu - when someone broke into her house last month . Reward: There currently is a $5,000 reward for the safe return of the two French bulldog-schauzer mixes . Spreading the word on social media and throughout the community helped Denes raise enough money to buy a billboard along a busy highway and to offer a $5,000 reward. Supporters also helped spread the word by plastering donated flyers throughout the city on several utility poles, traffic light poles, bus stops and city owned garbage cans. This, however, proved to be too much for city officials - West Hartford has a specific ordinance that prohibits people from posting signs on public property, including telephone poles and bus stops. 'It's everywhere. It's overwhelming,' Public Works Director John . Phillips told the Hartford Courant. 'There must be hundreds. Public infrastructure is not the . venue to display that.' 'I sympathize, but after the dogs are found, do people take them down?' Phillips said. 'They become blight and litter.' Social media: A social media campaign raised enough money for Denes to buy a billboard on a busy freeway . On Tuesday, Environmental Services Manager Dave Gabriele informed Denes that she had two weeks to remove the signs. 'I tried to be as sympathetic as I could; my wife and I were dog . owners,' Gabriele told the paper. He says that as sympathetic as he is to the cause, 'we've been real . consistent with how we've addressed these [types of] signs.' The town could potentially fine Denes if the signs aren't removed, but Gabriele says 'we're not looking to be punitive. We're always looking to resolve the issue.' Gabriele suggests that Denes and her army of supporters use lawn signs and bulletin boards in private businesses, but that she needs to refrain from posting the signs on public property. He added that the town has been very lenient about the signs, but that when there are complaints, the city needs to act. Anyone with info about the two pooches is asked to contact Denes or authorities in Hartford . 'I get it. A corner becomes a great place to get your point across,' he . said. But 'where do you draw the line between a person looking for their . dog and a business advertising gutter cleaning?' Denes says she's not happy that the city is forcing her to tone down her search, but says she understands that officials are only doing their jobs. All Denes cares about is getting her dogs back, but she's asked supporters to no longer post signs on public property, and that she would try to have the ones already posted removed. Denes says the $5,000 reward for the dogs won't get any higher, but wants anyone with information to call her - no questions asked, according to the paper. 'Except my love, they're not worth anything,' she said.","The two French bulldog-schnauzer mixes were missing after Amanda Denes' house was burglarized last month .

England’s nightmare winter took another self-inflicted turn for the worse when Ben Stokes was ruled out of the World Twenty20 after fracturing his hand punching a dressing rook locker.

"By . Patrick Collins . Once upon a time, when telegrams were a popular means of communication, Fulham Football Club boasted their own telegraphic address: ‘Fulhamish —  London SW6’. The years passed and telegrams fell from favour, yet still they clung to the same distinctive title. It seemed a snug fit for that raffish enclave on the Thames; a haven in which success was relished, failure was tolerated and laughter was guaranteed. Not so much an address, more a state of mind. Fulham is the place where they erected a preposterous statue to Michael Jackson because he was a chum of the last chairman. Down by the river: Craven Cottage has seen its fair share of drama throughout the years . Bad: Former owner Mohamed Al Fayed poses in front of the statue of Michael Jackson . It is the club where, long ago, a blissfully under-talented winger named Tosh Chamberlain was booked for swearing at his captain, the great Johnny Haynes. Tosh was not happy. ‘But he’s on my side!’ he complained. ‘I can call him anything I bleeding like!’ Quite recently, a fans’ forum was asked to define ‘Fulhamish’. One contributor suggested: ‘The ability to mock one’s own and to find humour in shameful circumstances.’ Another offered: ‘In the Hammersmith Road End at Craven Cottage, singing “Let’s all cheer for Torquay” because they’d only brought 20 fans. Then, naturally, Torquay scored. Fulhamish.’ Famous faces: Fulham old boys Johnny Hayens (top left), Tosh Chamberlain (top right), Rodney Marsh (below (left) and George Best (below right) But one fan expressed his fears with considerable candour: ‘Perhaps we have drifted from being Fulhamish to rubbish-ish,’ he said. What Felix Magath makes of it all, I really cannot imagine. Herr Magath is the third manager Fulham have tried this season, the last one, Rene Meulensteen, having lasted 75 days and 17 games. The new man came wading through carnage at the Cottage, following the dismissals of the coaches Alan Curbishley, Ray Wilkins, Mick Priest and Jonathan Hill. Show of emotion: Felix Magath was put through the mill on his first match as Fulham boss . The chairman, Shahid Khan, owns an American Football team called the Jacksonville Jaguars. He paid tribute to the departed quintet in these words: ‘I’m very grateful to Rene, Alan and Ray, as well as Mick and Jonathan, for their commitment to Fulham. Their efforts were admirable and appreciated and I wish them the best.’ It was a classic of effortless insincerity. The appointment of Magath, who has not worked in management since October 2012, represents Khan’s final shot at getting it right. The mass sackings, and consequent compensation bills, were gestures which only a billionaire could afford. Some of his surviving senior employees may have privately  queried the wisdom of allowing Meulensteen to buy five players on deadline day, including an £11million Greek striker, then firing the manager three weeks later. But, since Khan pays the bills, they never raised their voices. And anyway, the future belongs to Felix. This is a man who, in the course of a substantial managerial career, has acquired a reputation for being a pitiless trainer; drive them hard, success through sweat. It is a notion he does not discourage. A few of Fulham’s underachievers will have winced at his much-quoted justification: ‘Until now, everyone has lived through my training. No one died.’ Pedigree: Magath won the German cup during his stint with Bayern . Tough taskmaster: Magath leads Bayern players in training before defeat to Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League quarter-final . He is doubtless aware that such an attitude will win him public favour, since the public perceives footballers as being both overpaid and underworked. And yet Magath needs to be much more than a martinet if Fulham’s survival is to be achieved. Just about every gym in the country contains people capable of pushing athletes to their limits; it takes the talents of a teacher, an educator, an innovative coach to improve the skills which deliver results. Soon, we shall discover if Magath possesses those qualities, or if his hard-driving reputation represents the real man. The evidence is conflicting. ‘I’m a nice guy. I’m very nice,’ he insisted, with the smirk of a pantomime villain. Stephane Henchoz, one of his former players, said: ‘I understand where his critics are coming from but to call him Saddam Hussein is a bit strong,’ which is possibly not quite the compliment he intended. But the recent remark of Uli Hoeness, the renowned German international forward and current president of Bayern Munich, remains curiously disturbing. Hoeness, who once worked with Magath at Bayern, said: ‘I would never want to treat human beings the way he does.’ Time will tell. By the middle of May, they could be raising a statue to Felix in the place where Jacko once stood. Or the chap from the Jacksonville Jaguars could be forming a new firing squad. Because of what the club have been and what they have meant to the English game, we must wish them well. But we must also be forgiven a small shudder at the behaviour of those who are in control.Ruthless, pragmatic, uncompromising methods may go down well in certain Premier League boardrooms. But they are neither humane nor admirable. And they are certainly not Fulhamish. The most disturbing image of the sporting week was that of Manuel Pellegrini waving an imaginary card and frantically pleading for the booking of a Barcelona player. At the time, Manchester City were being slaughtered by a side playing with style and flair and exhilarating freedom. Pellegrini looked like a man trying to open a brolly in a hurricane. Later, after City had been soundly beaten, he would launch into a ludicrous diatribe against the referee. He was ‘not impartial’. He was inexperienced. Worst of all, he was Swedish. ‘It was not a good idea to put a referee from Sweden in charge of such an important match,’ said Pellegrini, with the desperate air of one who does not really expect to be taken seriously. Now, this is standard behaviour for the managerial tribe, whose members stagger along that fine line between sanity and chaos. Losing it: Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City were slaughtered by Barcelona in the Champions League . Yellow peril: Pellegrini was not impressed with Jonas Eriksson (right) Even Arsene Wenger, the very best of them, can succumb to hand-fluttering outrage, as he did when losing his goalkeeper to a stern but defensible decision in Arsenal’s tie with Bayern Munich. Yet Pellegrini’s tantrum was particularly disturbing, since it hinted at an unsuspected weakness in  a substantial man. Sixty years old, a graduate in civil engineering, he retired from a distinguished playing career to work in reconstruction projects in the Chilean earthquake zone. His subsequent managerial journey took him to some of the biggest clubs in Argentina, Chile and Spain. He is a proper coach who builds proper teams. And yet, just a few weeks back, he seemed rattled by the puerile provocations of Jose Mourinho. It was unclear why this formidable man should be affected by the taunts of such a tedious troll but Chelsea’s League victory at the Etihad created the kind of tremulous uncertainty that even City’s subsequent FA Cup success could not erase. Of course, he has time to demonstrate that the card-waving was not a trend but a lapse. Yet it remains an unsettling image. We had hoped that Pellegrini was immune to that kind of nonsense. We now know that he is as mad as all the rest. Graeme Swann is to join Test Match Special for England’s forthcoming tour of the West Indies. The mantle of John Arlott and Christopher Martin-Jenkins thus falls upon a former spinner and full-time ‘character’ who deserted the England team after they lost the first three Tests of the Ashes tour. Coming to the airwaves: Graeme Swann (right) will join the TMS team when the West Indies tour . A BBC executive promises: ‘Graeme will bring genuine insight to the audience… as well as his trademark sense of humour.’ The idea of inflicting that ‘trademark sense of humour’ upon TMS listeners is truly dispiriting. Still, there is always the chance that, after three matches, he will be on his way.","Now on their third manager of the season, will Fulham erect a statue of Felix Magath come May?

"By . Patrick Collins . For those who savour the spectacle of a manager at bay, David Moyes is providing splendid sport. The poor fellow is being scrutinised with sadistic relish. Are those stress lines on his brow? Does he seem a touch haggard? Has he lost the trust of his players? Is he crumpling under the pressure? Might he be considering something drastic; resignation, perhaps? The possibilities are endless. This past fortnight has not been kind to English clubs in the Champions League. Manchester City were gently passed to pieces by Barcelona. What next? United players look dejected as Olympiacos go 2-0 up in Greece in midweek . Where's the passion? Moyes has had his fair share of criticism, but the players deserve there's too . Arsenal, more creditably, were beaten by the reigning champions Bayern Munich, while Chelsea at least  managed a goal in their insipid draw with Galatasaray. But it was Manchester United who commanded most of the shock–horror notices by losing to Olympiakos. While the other results were merely disappointing, United’s first-leg performance carried darker overtones. This was a defeat which seemed to crystalise all the doubts and suspicions which now surround United. For this looked horribly like an exercise in shoulder-shrugging indifference. It was the kind of performance that demeaned a major European club. And worse, it damaged the reputation of ‘the best League in the world’. Despite all the evidence to the  contrary, that banal title is so often bestowed that it is rarely questioned. Its supporters insist that no other league can offer such pace, such  physical strength, such unstinting, often misguided, effort. And then there is the money; uncounted and uncountable, blissfully bubbling from a tap which is never turned off. Everything about the Premier League reeks of extreme wealth, from the gargantuan television contracts to the munificent patronage of sheik and oligarch, the stunning transfer fees, the steepling salaries, the insatiable taste for tacky excess. Sure, it cannot produce the equal of a Bayern, a Barcelona or a Real Madrid, neither can it produce enough capable  English players to mount a  credible World Cup challenge, but no matter. The Premier League makes a lot of ordinary players insanely rich, and it yields a winter’s worth of Super Sundays and Magic Mondays. The best in the world? No contest. Such is the delusion, one which Roy Keane dismissed in a few contemptuous phrases the other evening. Keane described the notion as ‘nonsense’. Invisible: Wayne Rooney put in an absent performance in Athens on Tuesday night . He said we had been ‘brainwashed’, that it was not ‘the best league’ but merely ‘the best brand’. In other words, the marketing is superb while the football is all too frequently second rate. And reality kicks in when our clubs approach the sharp end of a European campaign. Which brings us back to the manager of Manchester United. Moyes has been in the job for less than a season and he has undoubtedly been disturbed by the discovery that the team he inherited are woefully unfit for purpose. The flaws present themselves. Tom Cleverley’s attempts to influence midfield affairs are as fruitless with United as they are with England. Nemanja Vidic is no longer of relevance and as for the likes of Ashley Young, Chris Smalling and Antonio Valencia, the least said the better. Off colour: Tom Cleverley was hotly-tipped not so long ago, but has been disappointing overall . Helpless: Olympiacos' Michael Olaitan skips past Nemanja Vidic as the Serbian looks on . Robin van Persie was anxious to avoid any shadow of blame for his team’s plight: ‘My fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces I want to play in, and when I see that it makes it difficult,’ he explained. Then, having missed from 10 yards against Olympiakos, he reflected that it was: ‘A shame because I don’t get a lot of chances.’ Van Persie is reported to be ‘considering his future’ in the summer. While he is at it, he might give some thought to his recent past. Clueless: United players look frustrated as Dominguez runs away in celebration at the first goal . Down and out? David Moyes slumps back into his seat after Olympiacos score their second goal . Yet we doubt that there will be any serious self-examination from any of these people. Indeed, Michael Carrick seemed mildly miffed when it was suggested that United’s players might have brought their troubles upon themselves. Carrick, you see, is a famous footballer and just 10 months ago he and his chums won the championship of the best league in the world. As such, they are immune from criticism. No, if anybody deserves censure for United’s abysmal season, then we must turn to the usual  suspect, to the man whose ongoing agonies are public property. Of course Moyes has made his share of mistakes. His pragmatic strategies have often seemed at odds with United’s cavalier tradition, his bearing has sometimes appeared dourly disgruntled, while his transfer dealings have been uninspired. Maestro? Carrick is usually United's go-to man, but was poor on Tuesday night at Olympiacos . Outstretched: David De Gea is well beaten by Campbell's shot in the 55th minute to deflate United . Flat out: Robin van Persie lies on the floor after missing United's best chance of the game late on . Yet he is a talented, driven man who has taken on a massive task. If he is to succeed, he will have to spend vast sums of money and shed a cargo of footballers. And he will do so in the knowledge that little or no public blame will be attributed to those under-performing young men, nor to their successors. If it should all go wrong then he, the manager, will carry the can. Such is the nature of the job and David Moyes understood that when he signed his handsome contract. He  neither seeks nor deserves our sympathy but, as the headlines grow harsher and the Twitterati prattle their doltish abuse, he is entitled to a degree of intelligent understanding. It is not a lot to ask, from the best league in the world. Greg Dyke’s first six months as Football Association chairman have not been an unqualified success. From his opening battle cry — ‘I don’t think anyone realistically thinks we are going to win the World Cup in Brazil’ — to his fatuous cut-throat gesture at the announcement of England’s World Cup draw, to his ham-fisted attempts to recruit a so-called ‘England Commission’, Dyke has proceeded with the measured tread of a drunk on roller skates. But his latest mishap is far more serious. Not present: Dyke was presiding over an FA board meeting in London while Finney's funeral was taking place . On Thursday, when the English game was gathering in Preston to bury one of the noblest, most sublimely gifted men it has ever produced, Dyke was presiding over an FA board meeting, 218 miles away in London. Now, it is possible that Dyke does not understand how much Sir Tom Finney meant to English football, nor how rich was his contribution to the nation’s game. If so, then somebody, somewhere should have had the wit to brief him. Because the chairman of the Football Association should not have been swapping platitudes with a bunch of blazers. He . should have been seated in St John’s Minster to honour Sir Tom. It was . more than a matter of priorities; it was a question of duty. Lining the streets: The  hearse carrying Sir Tom Finney passes Preston's Deepdale ground . Carried in: Finney's coffin arrives for his funeral at Preston Minster, carried by former North End players Alan Kelly (left) and Graham Alexander (centre) and current star Joe Garner . Vincent Tan’s attempts to endear himself to Cardiff City followers have taken another fascinating turn. His earlier efforts included firing the successful manager, Malky Mackay, and changing the club’s colours from the traditional blue to a ‘lucky’ red. Now, with his club in the bottom three of the Premier League, the owner has warned supporters not to take him for granted. ‘Right now, I will stay,’ he said. ‘Unless the fans p*** me off so much, then I may leave.’ Clearly, the old charmer sees this as an ominous threat. He may well be mistaken. On the attack: Vincent Tan launched a tirade against former manager Malky Mackay . 'Beserk': Tan said Mackay only got the club promoted because he went 'beserk' with the owner's cash . A week ago, in an item on Fulham FC, I mentioned two of their former players, Johnny Haynes and Tosh Chamberlain. Haynes was described as a ‘great’ player, Chamberlain as ‘a blissfully under-talented winger’. I was attempting to convey my belief that, by comparison with the brilliant Haynes, everyone who played for Fulham in that era was ‘blissfully under-talented’. As many Fulham fans have pointed out, it was a poor choice of words which was quite unfair to a fine footballer and a much-loved character. I have apologised to Tosh and accepted his affectionate, and very ‘Fulhamish’, reprimand.

"By . Mike Dickson . Andy Murray has brought his coaching partnership with Ivan Lendl to an end, two-and-a-quarter years after the unlikely pair were brought together. Both parties described the split as mutual and amicable, with the Czech wishing his charge all success for the future and declaring that he wished to pursue other projects, such as playing on the Seniors Tour and running his tennis academy. Murray found the perfect foil in Lendl, who like him had struggled to win Grand Slams early in his career, and his bolstering presence soon helped him win the US Open, the Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail reporter get coached by Ivan Lendl . Split: Coach Ivan Lendl and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray have confirmed they have split after two years working together . Watching on: Lendl began working with Murray in 2011 . Improvement: Murray's game picked up under the guidance of the Czech-born coach . Hitting it off: Murray and Lendl gelled well to earn the Briton his first major titles . JUDY MURRAY - Andy's mum, Judy, was briefly a professional player herself. She is one of the country's top coaches and taught both Andy and brother Jamie as juniors. She is now the captain of Britain's Fed Cup team. WILLIE MURRAY - Andy's dad, he is not as prominent as Judy, and juggles running a chain of newsagents in Scotland with following Andy. KIM SEARS - Andy's girlfriend of eight years. She is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears and was once described by Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy'. JEZ GREEN - Murray's fitness coach and widely credited for turning him from a skinny youngster to a bulked-up athlete. He puts Murray through a punishing fitness regime, often in the baking heat of Miami, and has him on a strict diet that can often include up to 50 pieces of sushi in one meal. DANI VALLVERDU - A former singles player himself - if only ever reaching number 727 in the world - he has known Murray since they were teenagers. Acted as assistant coach to Lendl and is Murray's regular hitting partner. Murray, who is preparing to defend his Sony Open title in Miami over the next 12 days, said: 'I'm eternally grateful to Ivan for all his hard work over the past two years, the most successful of my career so far. As a team we have learned a lot and it will definitely be a benefit in future. I'll take some time with the team to consider the next steps.' It seems that for now he will work with his permanent on-the-road hitting partner, assistant coach and close friend Dani Vallverdu, backed up by his physio and fitness support team. Although there had been no overt signs of difficulties between Murray and Lendl there have been a few areas of concern opening up since the 26-year-old Scot returned from back surgery, which he underwent at the end of last September. Lendl has always made it clear that he would not travel full-time with Murray and has not been with him since the Australian Open, where he made the quarter finals. He was absent playing on the senior tour in other cities in America last week while the British No 1, currently down to No 6 in the world, toiled in Indian Wells, where he lost in the fourth round to Milos Raonic in a surprisingly tame deciding set. Champion: Murray was Wimbledon winner last summer, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final . As highlighted in Sportsmail on Tuesday, there have been some particularly odd scheduling decisions . from the Wimbledon champion this season, which has seen him play far . more than usual, on occasions seemingly without reference to the bigger . picture. In the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's surprise . announcement, it can only be speculated upon whether this was a source of . tension, but clearly the magic has gone out of their relationship . somewhere. It was always a bold appointment, hiring the . idiosyncratic Czech who had largely been out of tennis since his . retirement and had no prior one-to-one coaching experience. Yet the decision quickly looked inspired when, having properly hooked up . at the 2012 Australian Open, Murray went on to win the US Open . championship in September, emulating Fred Perry. Lendl . appeared to have added a missing ingredient of a calm influence on his . player before big finals, which had been notably absent before. It was . born out of his own experience of struggling to win them early on in his . own career, before progressing to claim eight of them in all. Prize guy: The Wimbledon victory earned Murray the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award . Gold standard: Murray won gold at the 2012 London Olympics, his first major triumph under Lendl . There seemed to be no ill feeling on Lendl's part as he described . Murray today as a 'first-class guy. I will always be in Andy's corner . and wish him nothing but great success as he too goes into a new phase . of his career.' It would . appear that Murray and Lendl must have decided on this course of action . over the past few days, as the Wimbledon champion arrived in Miami late . last week after his exit from Indian Wells and presumably met up with . his coach. This has . shaped up as an important week for Murray as he has 1,000 computer . points to defend and a failure to do so would mean another hit to his . ranking, which has fallen largely as a result of him missing the French . Open last year and the back end of the season through the surgery. After . this he will play in the Davis Cup for Great Britain against Italy - . confirmed in Wednesday's statement - and is then set to have an overdue mini . break before tackling the clay swing of the ATP Tour, starting at the . Madrid Open. Crashing out: Maurray exited the recent tournament in Indian Wells early . Although Wimbledon take into account previous grass court form when seedings are made, thus helping Murray, it would be harmful to his All England title defence if he ends up outside the top four. The more general need is for him to regain some proper momentum to his career after the back surgery, which itself appears to have been successful. The situation of the so-called Big Four and their coaching becomes ever more fascinating, and it would be intriguing to see if Murray goes for another big name now. With Lendl he set a trend followed by rivals Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who have hooked up with Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg respectively, the latter with excellent results so far.","Andy Murray and Ivan Lendl part company .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The wife of a Tory minister has hit back at criticism of MPs using taxpayers’ money to employ family members. Eve Burt, the wife of Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, said she should not have to defend her job earning up to £40,000 as an office manager, insisting it was ‘legally allowed’. It comes after new figures showed 155 MPs – nearly one in four – now have wives, children and even parents on the public payroll. Family affair: Eve Burt, who earns up to £40,000 working for Tory MP husband Alistair, has hit back at criticism of relatives being put on the public payroll . The taxpayer paid out £4million in salaries to MPs’ relatives last year, up from £3.5million in 2010-11. Among senior Tories enjoying the perk are Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Chief Whip Sir George Young and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. The latter two are millionaires and earn more than £130,000 a year. Mr Burt first employed his wife 30 years, after he was elected as MP for Bury North in 1983. He lost the seat in the 1997 election, but was elected MP for North East Bedfordshire in 2001. Mrs Burt insisted she worked hard . managing ‘a little team of four and a half staff’, for a salary listed . by the Commons expenses watchdog as being between £35,000 and £40,000. The . mother-of-two complained of the ‘odd hours’ involved in the job, but . rejected criticism that MPs should not be allowed to put family members . on the public payroll. Alistair Burt first employed his wife 30 years, after he was elected as MP for Bury North in 1983. The 58-year-old trained as a solicitor, and married Eve in 1983 - the same year he entered Parliament. He rose to become social security minister under John Major, but he lost his seat in the New Labour landslide at the 1997 election. He was re-elected MP for North East Bedfordshire in 2001, becoming deputy chairman of the Tory party in 2008 and joining the Foreign Office as Middle East minister after the coalition was formed. The couple have a son and a daughter. ‘My husband employed me 30 years ago. Should I have to defend myself every single day. Probably not,’ she told BBC Radio 4. ‘'I'm not sure I have to defend it at all. It is what it is. We are legally allowed to be employed by our partners or whoever. ‘When you read the newspaper reports it says ""propping up personal household income"". If it was anybody else it would say ""working for a salary"".’ The number of MPs declaring that they . have family members working for them increased by 17 per cent after new . rules were introduced increasing budgets for staffing. But . Mrs Burt insisted: 'It infers that somehow we are not doing a job. I . think it's done so much because it’s very practical. They work odd . hours, the hours have changed. ‘It's obviously particularly strange because Alistair is a Foreign Office minister so he is constantly travelling. ‘Most . of his travel at the moment starts on Sundays so he has to be quite . often heading to airports in the middle of a Sunday morning. ‘It's . two-centre working. It's most weekend working. You don't actually have . many jobs which have quite such oddly structured hours and I think . that's why families find it quite useful.' She went on: ‘We work wherever we are . whenever we need to, as opposed to fitting into some structure of office . hours, I think that's why it's popular. ‘Constituents . can phone at any time of the day and night - and they do, and that's . fine, we provide that kind of service in the office because we can. If . somebody wants to ring me up at seven o'clock on a Sunday morning to say . there's something wrong, they can and that's OK. ‘We . do have a hectic schedule... I'm not moaning, it's what we do. We love . what we do. It's a fantastic way of life, it's a fantastic job, we enjoy . the public engagement. ‘But . I really don't see why I should spend my time defending the fact that . somebody pays me to do the 37-and-a-half hours in the office every . week.’ Hectic: Mother-of-two Mrs Burt said it was 'hectic' running a team of four and a half staff covering her husband's constituency work . Travel: Mr Burt (centre) often has to leave the house on Sunday mornings to fly around the world, in his role as a minister under Foreign Secretary William Hague (right) An MP who employs her daughter at taxpayers' expense claimed she would be earning 'less than the minimum wage' if her hours were taken into account. Nadine Dorries, the outspoken Tory, defended hiring her daughter Jennifer as a constituency caseworker on a salary of £30,400. She said that the 26 year-old provided 'value for money' as she worked weekends and could always be relied on. The MP said on Twitter: 'Given the hours she works, she would argue, very strongly that she is on less than minimum wage and abused,' adding a smiley face. The bill for MPs’ expenses rose by an . inflation-busting 7 per cent despite David Cameron’s pledge to bring . down the cost of politics. The . 17 per cent rise in family employment reflects a rule change that . allows MPs to spend more on staff and, by using relatives, top up their . household income. In 2011/12 . they were allowed to claim only £115,000 a year for staff. But that was . increased in 2012/13 to £144,000 for London MPs to reflect higher costs . in the capital. Other MPs claim up to £137,000. Expenses . – office outlays and personal costs such as travel and accommodation – . were up from £91.5million in 2011/12 to £98million, according to the . Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. Spending is now higher than in the run-up to the expenses scandal of 2009. Matthew . Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Any politician using . taxpayers’ money to employ a relative must be completely open about who . is being paid, how much and for what. ‘And . in the light of past abuses, they shouldn’t be surprised when their . constituents demand more openness if they fail to give a detailed . explanation as to how they are spending that cash.’ The . public outcry over MPs employing family members began in 2008, when . Tory MP Derek Conway was accused of paying his two sons for non-existent . jobs. Calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later. Other . ministers who employ relatives include Hugo Swire from the Foreign . Office, business minister Michael Fallon, Stephen Hammond at the . Department for Transport, and Northern Ireland minister Mike Penning. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (left) employs . his wife as a senior secretary on £39,999, while Sir George Young, the .

Sunseekers on Italy's Isola del Giglio look on as salvage crews begin the mammoth task of refloating the Costa Concordia - almost half a year after the stricken vessel capsized off the Tuscan coast. Engineers yesterday moved a salvage rig - the Titan-Micoperi - into place next to the luxury cruise liner, which capsized in January, when it struck an 80-ton rock that lay . within a submerged reef. The operation to refloat the 114,000-ton . liner and tow her away will take one year to complete in what has been described . as an 'unprecedented' procedure. It is expected to cost more than $300million (£190million). But it hasn't put holidaymakers off visiting the idyllic island. As temperatures reached 28 degrees Celsius today, sunbathers stripped down and swam in the Tyrrhenian sea - just yards from the salvage operation. Scroll down for video .

Unprecedented operation: Engineers have moved a salvage rig - the Titan-Micoperi (bottom right) - into place next to the cruise liner off the coast of Isola del Giglio, Italy . Huge task: The operation to refloat the 114,000-ton liner and tow her away will take one year to complete and is expected to cost more than $300million (£190million) A . cage will be built around the Concordia and then barges with cranes . will be brought in and anchored to the sea bed to help straighten and . refloat the massive 290metre-long ship. Once upright, it will be towed to a dry dock where it is expected to be scrapped. It emerged last week that . the massive rock lodged into her side will be removed and turned into a . memorial to the 32 people who lost their lives on the ill-fated vessel. Captain Francesco Schettino is . accused of altering the course of the ship so that it sailed close to . the picturesque coast in a bid to impress passengers and crew, as well . as locals waiting on a nearby island. But the liner instead sailed straight . into the path of the rock, which tore a 70-metre hole into the side of . the Costa Concordia's hull before becoming lodged inside the vessel. More than 4,000 holidaymakers and . crew were on board when the disaster struck just three hours after the . ship left port for the start of a Mediterranean cruise on January 13. At . the time, coastguards said they had 'never seen' anything like it and . described the lodged rock as 'unique in maritime history'. A cage will be built around the Concordia and then barges with cranes will be brought in and anchored to the sea bed to help straighten and refloat the massive ship . Tragedy: More than 4,000 holidaymakers and crew were on board when the disaster struck just three hours after the ship left port on a Mediterranean cruise in January . Long operation: Salvage engineers prepare to start work on refloating the Costa Concordia . Under house arrest: Captain Francesco Schettino is accused of causing the shipwreck, among other charges . Sergio . Ortelli, mayor of Giglio, confirmed £40,000 will be spent to remove the . rock as part of the judicial investigation into the tragedy and it will . later be turned into a 'fitting' memorial. He said: 'The Costa Cruises company has said this is what they want to happen and it is also what we want to happen. 'It will be removed and turned into a memorial of some sorts so that the island can pay tribute to those who lost their lives. 'We . have no idea yet where it will be positioned, but most likely it will . be close to the harbour entrance so that visitors and locals can see it . clearly and pay their respects to the victims. 'What happened that night is something Giglio will never forget and the rock will be a fitting memorial.' Prosecutors have launched an investigation into Mr Schettino's actions, who is currently under house arrest. He has been charged with causing a . shipwreck, multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and failing to inform . maritime authorities of the situation. It is claimed that Mr Schettino delayed the order to abandon ship for more than an hour. This . meant that by the time the lifeboats were launched, it was already too . late to use them because of the angle of the Concordia. Many passengers and crew had to make their way down the hull on rope ladders instead. Witnesses . have told prosecutors that Mr Schettino was in a lifeboat when at least . 300 people were still on board and needed to be rescued. This . allegation has led to claims of cowardice against the captain, as he . saved himself instead of following the maritime tradition of staying at . his post as late as possible. The Costa Concordia lies aground in front of the Isola del Giglio on January 23, ten days after the disaster unfolded . Tribute: The massive rock lodged into the side of the ship will be removed and turned into a memorial to the 32 people who lost their lives on the ill-fated vessel . People . living in Giglio want the ship removed as quickly as possible and . without any lasting environmental impact to the the area. The . coast is a protected maritime park and boasts a strong population of . whales, porpoises and dolphins. The island's beaches are also a popular . attraction for thousands of tourists every summer who flock to Giglio. Earlier . this year, salvage teams pumped off 2,380 tonnes of heavy duty diesel . that remained in the ship's fuel tanks, in a round-the-clock operation . lasting five weeks. Mr . Schettino is currently under house arrest at his home in Meta di . Sorrento, near Naples. His trial is set to resume next month.","Engineers move a salvage rig into place next to the luxury cruise liner off the Isola del Giglio, Italy .

"By . Tara Brady . Actor Peter Gilmore, who starred in the long-running BBC drama The Onedin Line, has died at the age of 81. The star, who also appeared in a number of Carry On films, died at the Trinity Hospice in London after a 'long illness', his family have said. German-born Gilmore clocked up appearances in a number of TV dramas such as Doctor Who, The Persuaders, Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Heartbeat. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Long illness: Peter Gilmore as James Onedin in the BBC drama The Onedin Line . But he will be best remembered for his portrayal of the mutton-chopped James Onedin in 91 episodes of the BBC1 series The Onedin Line. The saga - with its theme tune familiar to a generation - followed the fortunes of a family shipping line in the second half of the 19th century. His co-star Jessica Benton, who also appeared in other BBC period dramas The Duchess Of Duke Street and Upstairs, Downstairs, said: 'The Onedin Line was a very happy, long-running series to be involved in and that was all credit to Peter because he made it so. 'We all became very close friends over the years and had a lot of fun. Close: Peter Gilmore with his co-star Jessica Benton who described him as a gentle man . Sorely missed: Peter Gilmore (far right) clocked up 91 appearances in the BBC1 series The Onedin Line . 'Peter was a gentle man and a gentleman and we sorely miss him.' Born in Leipzig, he came to the UK at six and was raised in Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire, leaving school at 14 to pursue an acting career. His big break was in the TV series Ivanhoe in 1958 and he went on to appear in West End musical stage successes such as Lock Up Your Daughters and The Beggar's Opera. Peter Gilmore starred alongside Sidney James and Kenneth Williams in several films, including Carry on Cowboy . Familiar face: Peter Gilmore (right) appeared in 11 Carry On films starring with the likes of Barbara Windsor . Gilmore's penultimate appearance was as the flirtatious but dangerous King Francis in Carry On Henry which was his biggest and best role in a Carry On . Among his many films, he appeared in popular comedies such as Carry On Up The Khyber and Carry On Henry as well as the ghoulish British horror film The Abominable Doctor Phibes. Gilmore, who died on Sunday, was married to actress Una Stubbs for more than a decade and went on to marry Anne Stallybrass, who also played his wife in the first two series of The Onedin Line. Co-stars: Peter Gilmore went on to marry Anne Stallybrass who played his wife in the BBC1 series The Onedin Line . His agent Primie Carey said: 'On behalf of his wife Anne and Peter's family I would like to thank those who have sent their kind thoughts and condolences and would request their privacy is respected at this sad time.' James Onedin's name derived from a sea nymph after the programme's creator, Cyril Abraham, read about the mythological figure Ondine. In 1978 he starred opposite Doug McLure in the film Warlords Of Atlantis and regretted becoming too typecast as Onedin in his pursuit for other lead roles. During the 1950s and 60s he became known for his performances in British stage musicals, appearing in Hooray For Daisy, and met actress Una Stubbs while working on the programme Cool For Cats. The couple married in 1958 but separated after 11 years. Gilmore would also become a familiar face in the Carry On films and appeared in 11 of the well-loved British movies. In 1970 he married stage actress Jan Waters but the couple divorced six years later and Gilmore began living with Anne Stallybrass who played his wife in The Onedin Line. The pair went on to marry in 1987. In his later years he played a security chief called Brazen in the Doctor Who series, who died while trying to help the doctor escape. He is survived by his wife Anne and a son, Jason, from his first marriage.

Paris Saint-Germain are continuing to show interest in Chelsea . defender Branislav Ivanovic. The Serbian is looking to open talks over a new contract at . Stamford Bridge and is keen to stay but the wealthy French club are monitoring . developments. Jose Mourinho is a big fan of Ivanovic and would not want to . let him go but the next contract is a crucial one for a player who turned 30 . last month. His current deal has two years to run but early negotiations are . underway with Ivanovic seen as a key senior figure. In-demand: Chelsea long-serving Serbian defender Branislav Ivanovic is wanted by PSG . Chelsea will take decisions over the future of John Terry . and Frank Lampard over coming weeks as well as Ashley Cole. It is understood Cole could trigger another year option if . he plays a set amount of games but that seems unlikely with Mourinho's current . team selection. Terry and Lampard are expected to be offered one-year . options but Cole is ready to leave with Luke Shaw of Southampton expected to arrive in . the summer. Shaw thing: Chelsea are expected to move for the Southampton left back (left) in the summer . Moving on? Ashley Cole (left) has fallen out of favour at Chelsea this season . Otherwise it is a relatively young Chelsea squad and . Ivanovic will play a pivotal role in the dressing room for Mourinho over the coming . years. PSG have made no secret of their admiration for Ivanovic but . realising his affection for Chelsea have also considered his team-mate David . Luiz, who is again figuring on the list of targets for Bayern Munich and . Barcelona. Laurent Blanc wants players with European competition . experience to fit in alongside Thiago Silva with former Chelsea defender Alex . possibly moving on to AC Milan depending how his own contract talks go. In the market: PSG boss Laurent Blanc is looking for defensive reinforcements this summer . Chelsea rebuff loan interest in young Dutch star Ake . Leeds and Bolton are set to be disappointed in their pursuit . of Chelsea youngster Nathan Ake. Burnley, Watford and Wigan all made enquiries in January and . were given a similar response with Chelsea keen to keep the 19-year-old at . Stamford Bridge. Signed from Feyenoord in 2011, Ake was Chelsea's young . player of the year in 2013. He can play left-back, centre back or centre . midfield and Chelsea want the Dutch Under 21 international to qualify as a homegrown . player. Leeds and Bolton are both interested in taking him on loan . but he is set to continue his development with Chelsea's U21s and first team . squad. Dutch of class: Chelsea have high hopes for versatile defender Nathan Ake . Coton links up with former City team-mate Rosler at Wigan . Former Manchester City and United goalkeeper Tony Coton has . linked up with Uwe Rosler as chief scout at Wigan Athletic. Coton, 52, who also . played for Watford, Birmingham and Sunderland, had been scouting for QPR among . other clubs. He replaces John McGinlay who left Wigan on Thursday. Rosler is . also keen to bring in former Brentford coach Peter Farrell in a director of . football role. Arsenal, meanwhile, have recruited former Tottenham scout Ian Broomfield who . was chief scout at QPR with Harry Redknapp, he will work . alongside Steve Rowley. Scouting mission: Tony Coton (right) worked with Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United . Derry released by Gillingham . Pacey young striker Tom Derry has been released by . Gillingham to give him the maximum opportunity to find another club. Derry, signed from Charlton, was told he can go by manager . Peter Taylor as he looks to shake-up his squad for next season. Derry - who was brought to the club by previous manager . Martin Allen - has spent this season out on loan at Chelmsford City, where he . was twice voted player of the month, and Eastbourne Borough. Derry, 19, has this week been offered a contract by . Eastbourne manager Tommy Widdrington until the end of the season, after his . loan came to an end. Former Southampton midfielder Widdrington has agreed to . allow Derry to trial for interested SkyBet League clubs too as part of the . deal. Eastbourne are in play-off contention in seventh place in . the Skrill Conference South but have three games in hand on some of their . rivals. Alonso keen to stay in England . Sunderland defender Marcos Alonso is keen on a permanent . return to England after impressing during his loan spell. The 23-year-old has . been a dependable figure under Gus Poyet since joining from Fiorentina in . December. The Spaniard made just nine appearance for Fiorentina and despite the . attraction of Serie A is hoping his performances for Sunderland will lead to a . bid in the summer. One problem though is it is understood that former . Sunderland sporting director Roberto di Fanti did not negotiate an option to . buy for the club so there is a risk his valuation will increase and that could . allow other interested Premier League sides to step in. Finalist: Alonso (left) played the full 90 minutes as Sunderland lost to Man City at Wembley on Sunday . Fazio on Everton's radar . Everton scouts watched Federico Fazio of Sevilla again last week. The 26-year-old helped guide Sevilla past NK Maribor in the Europa League on Thursday as he continues his impressive form. Liverpool have also watched Fazio who has long been on Arsenal's scouting list. Manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to bring in another centre-back with question marks remaining over Daniel Agger. Cardiff's Steven Caulker remains a possible option but much may hinge on whether Cardiff stay up. Giant: Sevilla's Argentina international defender Fazio stands at 6ft 5in . Southampton monitoring Braga starlet Rafa . Southampton are continuing to monitor Sporting Braga midfielder Rafa. The 20-year-old, who has scored nine goals in 20 games, has a £20.6m release clause in his contract and has also been watched by Bayer Leverkusen and Sevilla.

Tottenham are in advanced talks for Anderlecht midfield prospect Ismail Azzaoui. The 16-year-old has already made his first team debut for the Belgian club and Anderlecht's youth officer Jean Kindermans told Het Laatste Niuws: 'We have heard that Spurs are interested in Azzaoui and it is the player's right to make a choice. 'We regret that he will leave us, but you cannot compare this loss with Adnan Januzaj's move to Manchester United a few years ago. When players get to 16, we offer them a development plan and later a financial plan. We will not change the way we work.' Aston Villa are close to an agreement for Swedish teenager Moustafa Zeidan. The 15-year-old striker is at Högaborgs BK where he has already made his first team debut for Högaborgs and will join Villa at the end of the season. His representative Hasan Cetinkaya told Sportbladet: 'He connects to Aston Villa in June after school is out. He will join their U18-U19 teams, even though he is 15 years old.

"By . Ruth Styles . With her hair swept neatly into a bun and her pink silk sari draped elegantly over one shoulder, Jessica Michibata looked every inch the Bollywood star as she posed for pictures ahead of the Indian Grand Prix. After posting a photo of her hennaed hands on Instagram and declaring herself to be feeling 'very Indian today', Michibata later told Indian news agency IANS that she was thrilled to have been able to indulge in a shopping trip while in India. 'I wanted to wear something Indian,' the model told the agency during an interview at McLaren headquarters. Glamorous: Michibata looks every inch the Bollywood star as she poses in a sari ahead of the Indian Grand Prix . Stunning: The model, 29, declared herself to be feeling 'very Indian' on social networking site Instagram . 'I have always loved the use of colours here. I am glad I got time to do some shopping,' The 29-year-old model was at the Buddh International Circuit in Noida in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to support boyfriend Jenson Button. Although Button could only muster a 14th place finish - and failed to stop Germany's Sebastien Vettel from claiming a fourth consecutive Formula One world title - his loyal girlfriend was on hand to cheer him up as he emerged from the paddock. The pair were seen strolling arm-in-arm through the crowds surrounding the track, although Michibata had by then swapped her hot pink sari for a pretty blush maxi dress. The twosome have been a couple since 2009 and Tokyo-born Michibata is regularly seen by her boyfriend's side as he tours the world in pursuit of elusive racing success. Although Button's racing results haven't been particularly eye-catching of late, Michibata's chic style most certainly is - with the model garnering fashion credit aplenty with her boho-luxe approach to dressing. Elegant: The model appeared comfortable in her sari with part of the garment flung casually over her shoulder . Earlier this month, she stole the show at the Korean Grand Prix in Yeongnam in South Korea, appearing in the paddock in a stunning floral dress teamed with a simple pair of tan ankle boots. While Jessica has the sort of stunning features most women can only dream of, she once admitted in an interview with the Evening Standard that she has struggled to cope with the attention her looks bring her at times. 'I just wanted to be like all my friends. I didn't want to be special, or for people to think I was different,' she told the London newspaper. 'I asked my teacher once why I was getting all this weird attention. I said, ""I've got two eyes, one nose and two lips, how come I look different?""' Happy: Since meeting Jenson Button in 2009, Michibata has become a fixture in the Formula One paddock . Happy couple: Button and Michibata wander arm-in-arm through the paddock at the Buddh International Circuit . Despite her good looks - and those of her other half - Michibata says neither of them get jealous when they get attention from the opposite sex. 'I never get jealous when women come up to Jenson and try to chat with him,' she insisted. 'I know lots of women fancy him because he's a Formula 1 driver and the world champion, not because they love his personality. 'I get the same thing happening with male fans. I have fans that love me crazily. One of them said he would have a tattoo of my face done on his body. 'He's a very true fan if that makes him happy. Jenson understands that, too.'","The model, 29, was in Noida in Uttar Pradesh to support Jenson Button .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . What a quarter-final draw this will be. Every tie should be a brilliant contest. Of course the big three — Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid — are the favourites, and it’s hard to look beyond one of them, but you can’t rule anyone out. Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid might seem the easier teams on paper, but Dortmund reached the final last year and Atletico are second in La Liga. PSG are so strong and United, for all their issues, can still cause sides problems. I do think, though, that Chelsea have a chance to recreate the glory of 2012. They rode their luck that year, but the memories are still fresh and under Jose Mourinho they look fitter and stronger. He knows how to win big matches and nobody will fancy testing themselves against him. Two wins in three years? Chelsea were underdogs to win in 2012 but they could replicate that famous win in Munich . Red hot favourites: Bayern Munich can become the first team in the Champions League era to successfully defend the trophy . Going through: Manchester United secured their place in the last eight with a thumping 3-0 win at Old Trafford . I think Chelsea could win it this season, I really do. Under Jose Mourinho they are aggressive, they press the ball and Jose loves being an underdog. He won’t want to play a team like Atletico because it will be a similar match, but against the bigger sides he knows what it takes to win. They are defensively sound and with a good draw they could do it. You look at what they did in 2012 and you still can’t quite believe it. They are in better physical condition and the only thing that will hold them back is the lack of a top-class goalscorer. STAR MAN: EDEN HAZARD . He has matured into an outstanding player this season and he has everything. When you look at his performances, it’s easy to forget just how young he still is. Been there, done it: Jose Mourinho has won the Champions League with Porto and Inter Milan - can he become the first manager to do it with three clubs? On a roll: In Eden Hazard, Chelsea have a player of the very highest calibre . Bayern Munich 15/8Barcelona 7/2Real Madrid 4/1Chelsea 10/1PSG 10/1Atletico Madrid 12/1Borussia Dortmund 14/1Man Utd 20/1 . Click to view these odds and more . It's amazing to think Manchester United are rank outsiders in this competition. Most teams would be happy to draw them, but nobody would want a second leg at Old Trafford. It was a good display on Wednesday and if they get a result against City next week, their price might just change. They are not a terrible team, it’s more of a confidence issue. A few more performances like the one against Olympiacos and they can restore some belief that has been lacking. The quarter-final and clash with City will go a long way to deciding if David Moyes is still there next season. STAR MAN: ROBIN VAN PERSIE . He’s been disappointing and will have been stung by criticism, but top players always produce, as he did on Wednesday night. The catalyst: Manchester United fought back from the bring, beating Olympiacos 3-0 at Old Trafford to seal their spot in the last eight . Flying Sutchman: The form of Robin van Persie will be key to United's chances of progression in the competition . Atletico have a real aggressive nature to their team this season. Last year Jurgen Klopp was the unknown man but this year it’s Diego Simeone. He has his team very well organised and is always barking orders on the touchline. I’ve been impressed with Arda Turan and Koke, and Diego Costa is a real star striker. STAR MAN: DIEGO COSTA . So strong and if anybody looks like a Mourinho player, it’s Costa. Suits you, sir: Diego Simeone (left) and Diego Costa have been integral to Atletico Madrid's resurgence in form . How's stat: Gabi is top of the charts when it comes to fouls committed by any player left in the competition . Barcelona are always in the frame but you can’t help but think of last year’s 7-0 aggregate defeat by Bayern. They missed Lionel Messi in that tie but the result will still be on their minds. They are not the side of three years ago and have defensive worries. Javier Mascherano is not a good enough defender. STAR MAN: LIONEL MESSI . Not at the same level as 2010 but a genius who can destroy anybody. An accident waiting to happen? Javier Mascherano (left) is a weak link while Lionel Messi is back to his best . Flying the flag: Barcelona fans cheer on their side against Manchester City in the last 16 . I said last year they’d win it and I still think they will be the first team to retain it. They are a team full of stars and they all know their jobs. If any side can trouble them it’s Chelsea. The memory of the 2012 final is there and with Jose and Pep Guardiola in charge, the mind games will begin. STAR MAN: FRANCK RIBERY . It’s very hard to pick one main man, but Ribery has everything: pace, skill and real star quality. Making his point: Pep Guardiola (left) can steer Bayern to their sixth European Cup win with the likes of Franck Ribery in the side . Dortmund were so thrilling to watch last year but are not at the same level. They have suffered injuries and lost Mario Gotze to Bayern. But they got to the final last year so have pedigree. STAR MAN: ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI . The Pole is a beautiful footballer but with a move in the summer you question his drive. Black and gold: Borussia Dortmund are 14/1 to win this year's Champions League . Pole star: But Robert Lewandowski will miss the first leg of Dortmund's quarter-final after picking up a booking in the defeat to Zenit . The dark horses this year. PSG have two of the world’s best strikers in Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, but they are strong in midfield too and Thiago Silva is one of the best defenders around. They were unlucky to lose to Barcelona last year and nobody will want to draw them. STAR MAN: EDINSON CAVANI . It’s easy to pick out Ibrahimovic, but Cavani is an unsung hero. He has quality and works hard. Superstar: Zlatan Ibrahimovic has the ability to win matches on his own for Paris Saint-Germain . Strong supporting cast: Edinson Cavani has had an excellent first season in France, netting 18 times in all competitions . They are finding their rhythm at the right time. They have two heavyweights in Bale and Ronaldo but Luka Modric has been an unsung hero. Despite all his trophies, I’ve always felt Sergio Ramos is a bit of a liability at the back. But with those attackers, they are capable of anything. STAR MAN: CRISTIANO RONALDO . He is a game changer and the one man you wouldn’t want to come up against as an opponent. A liability: Sergio Ramos (right) is not the best central defender left in the competition . A force of nature: Cristiano Ronaldo (right) has everything in his locker and will look to bring Real Madrid a first European Cup since 2002 .","Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid are the favourites, but you can’t rule anyone out .
I do think that Chelsea have a chance to recreate the glory of 2012 .
Barcelona are not the side of three years ago and have serious defensive worries .
Real Madrid have Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo and are finding their rhythm at the right time .
Bayern Munich are a team full of stars and I think they can retain their title ."
"By . Jill Reilly . Ariel Sharon's burial alongside his wife yesterday was disturbed by two rockets fired by militants in nearby Gaza. Minutes after the former prime minister was buried in a plot at his family farm on Monday, militants fired the missiles into southern Israel, the army said. They were on high alert for any rockets being fired out of the Palestinian territory and responded with air strikes on two militant . camps in Gaza, Palestinian officials said, bombing strongholds of Islamic Jihad, a militant group. Ariel Sharon's burial alongside his wife yesterday was disturbed by two rockets fired by militants in nearby Gaza . Members of the Knesset guard carry the coffin of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon . No injuries were reported in . any of the attacks. Sharon was regarded as a war hero at home but as a war criminal by many in the Arab world. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and former British prime minister Tony Blair laid wreaths at his grave, 10 km (6 miles) from the border of the Gaza Strip. 'We are accompanying to his final resting place today a soldier, an exceptional soldier, a commander who knew how to win,' Israeli President Shimon Peres said in Jerusalem, Sharon's hefty coffin draped in Israel's blue and white flag. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (right) shakes hands with Omri Sharon, the older son of the former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel (Arik) Sharon . At Sharon's graveside, his son Gilad remembered his father for overcoming the odds, whether it was battling a Palestinian uprising after becoming prime minister in 2001 or clinging to life in his final days even after his kidneys had stopped functioning . Joe Biden greets the sons of Ariel Sharon, Omri and Gilad at the start of the memorial . Sharon, 85, died on Saturday after . spending the last eight years of his life motionless in a hospital bed, . pitched into a coma by a stroke and far from the public gaze. The death of the former general reopened debate into his legacy. Opponents denounced his ruthless conduct in military operations while friends praised him as a strategic genius who as prime minister stunned the world in 2005 by pulling Israeli troops and settlers out of Gaza. 'The security of his people was always Arik's unwavering mission - a non-breakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years from now,' Biden said, using Sharon's nickname. There was no direct mention of events that made Sharon a hated figure in the Arab world, such as the 1982 invasion of Lebanon that he masterminded as defence minister. However, in his eulogy, Blair said the man known at home as 'the bulldozer' had left 'considerable debris in his wake'. Iconic: This picture taken on November 16, 2005 shows former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon addressing a press conference in Jerusalem . Ariel Sharon taking a ride on a mini-tractor on his ranch in southern Israel with his wife Lily who he is buried next to and one of his grandchildren . Biden referred simply to his 'mistakes', saying: 'History will judge that he also lived in complex times, in a very complex neighbourhood.' The Israeli foreign ministry said dignitaries had come from 21 countries, mainly in Europe, but did not list any delegations from the Middle East, Africa or Latin America. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, noting he had not always seen eye-to-eye with Sharon on policy matters although they both stood on the right of Israel's political spectrum, praised his commitment to Israel's security. 'Arik understood that in matters of our existence and security, we must stand firm. Israel will continue to fight terror. Israel will continue to strive for peace, while protecting our security. Israel will act in every way to deny Iran the capability of arming itself with nuclear weapons.' Beefy and brusque, Sharon was seen at home as a master of the battlefield: his crossing of Egypt's Suez Canal in the 1973 Middle East war is still studied in military college. By the same token, the drawn-out 1982 campaign in Lebanon is regarded as his worst mistake, which reached its nadir when hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila were killed by Israeli-allied Christian militiamen. Sharon was forced to stand down as defence minister in 1983 after an Israeli investigation ruled that he bore 'personal responsibility' for not preventing the massacre. Written off at the time, he soon bounced back and served as prime minister from 2001 until he was incapacitated by stroke. A memorial service was held followed by a funeral near Sycamore Farm, the former prime minister's residence . Israelis are paying their respects to Ariel Sharon, whose controversial life inspired admiration and provoked revulsion and whose death drew emotional reactions even after eight years in a coma . An Israeli woman mourns for former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as he lies-in-state on the plaza of the Knesset . Neither Netanyahu nor Peres mentioned the Lebanon war or disengagement from Gaza, which showed Israel could roll back its occupation of the Palestinian territories given determined leadership. Both Biden and Blair welcomed the pullout.However, one of Sharon's friends, settler leader Zeev Hever, made clear the sense of hurt felt by some Israelis.'Your disengagement in the final two years of your term from the path we had walked together was particularly difficult and painful,' he told mourners, recalling Sharon's past pivotal role while in various cabinet posts in expanding settlements on territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Two years after Israel left Gaza, the Islamist group Hamas seized control, calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. Israel had strengthened security for Sharon's burial and warned Hamas not to allow rocket fire during the ceremony. Hamas Interior Minister Fathi Hamad denounced 'our worst enemy, the cursed Sharon' during a rally in Gaza to mark the 2008-09 war with Israel. How to handle Gaza is among the sticking points in Israel's U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas's rival based in the occupied West Bank. During his brief visit to Israel, Biden will discuss the so far fruitless talks with Netanyahu and Peres, U.S. officials said. The vice president will also seek to ease Netanyahu's concerns about world powers' interim nuclear deal with Israel's arch-foe Iran, which takes effect on Jan. 20. Sharon and Peres are the last of the so-called 1948 generation of leaders who played a prominent role in Israeli public life right from the foundation of the Jewish state. 'He left us too soon. But the work of trying to reach peace continues,' said Biden, hinting that had Sharon stayed healthy, he might have taken further steps after the Gaza withdrawal to end the decades-old Middle East conflict.","Missiles fired minutes after the former prime minister was buried .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself last year after she was allegedly sexually assaulted at a party . The three teenage boys who authorities say drove 15-year-old Audrie Pott to hang herself in 2012 have admitted to sexually assaulting the girl - and taking photographs of the humiliating ordeal - eight days before she took her own life. After admitting to the attack - during which the three teens 'digitally penetrated' the young girl - the boys each were sentenced to serve 30 to 45 days in a juvenile detention facility. Because of their ages, the three teens have not been identified. Pott's family has declined to comment on the criminal case, but appear to be outraged by the anonymity the boy's get to enjoy. 'As much as we strongly disagree with and are actively attempting to change the lenient privacy laws afforded to juveniles, even when they commit as here heinous acts on an unconscious minor, we cannot publicly comment on any aspect of any criminal proceedings involving these young men,' Robert Allard, an attorney for Lawrence and Sheila Pott - Audrie's parents - said in a statement to SFGate. Pott, from Saratoga, California, took her life in after sending Facebook messages to the boys who assaulted her at an alcohol-fueled party in September of 2012. After the party, where Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade, the teen woke up without her shorts on and with mocking comments written in marker all over her body. Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers. Heartbroken: Larry Pott and Audrie's stepmother Lisa believe that the bullying at school led to the tragedy. Now one of the accused boys claims they are partly to blame . 'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident. She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos. 'I swear to god if u still have those . pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers . in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house. In addition to the criminal charges, the Potts have filed a civil lawsuit against the teens they say are responsible for their daughter's suicide. Shockingly, one of the boys convicted of assaulting Pott is claiming that the girl's parents share some of the blame in their daughter's tragic death. In court documents filed by attorney Philip Pereira on behalf of one of Pott's unnamed attackers, the boy claims that Lawrence and Sheila Pott failed to act on the girl's 'long-standing and serious emotional problems before her suicide and they should have sought professional help.' The filing also mentions an 'altercation' between Audrie and two of her friends shortly before her death. Allard, the parents' attorney, reacted angrily to the assertions. Cruel: Pott, right, was allegedly assaulted after a night of drinking  and boys spread photos of the attack . He released a statement reading: 'The sole issue in this case is the callous behavior of the . suspects which directly led to Audrie's unnecessary death. 'Since this . lawsuit was filed, it has become quite clear to us that the suspects . refuse to accept responsibility or show remorse for their actions.' SFGate.com reported that Allard described the document as 'a revolting attempt to deflect . responsibility away from his clients. 'This case is and will always be . about the tragic consequences associated with sexual assault and cyber . bullying.' Her devastated . parents blame her death on the horrific sexual attack a week earlier at . the hands of three teenage boys who then allegedly tried to cover up . their involvement. On . the night of the attack, a group of teenagers were at a friend's house . drinking heavily. The girl who lived at the house threw the party when . her parents left town. Three male classmates allegedly . helped an inebriated Audrie to a bedroom before stripping her naked, drawing over her . body and sexually assaulting her. Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Audrie Pott wrote a series of desperate Facebook messages before her death that have been excerpted in Rolling Stone. In one exchange, she speaks to one of her alleged attackers: . AUDRIE: i need to talk to u. BOY: What . AUDRIE: one word... marker . BOY: What about marker . AUDRIE: u know what im talking about... i dont remeber anything about that... [A friend] had to tell me everything... i swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u . BOY: They are deleted and I didn't take them I promise it wasn't me... And I'm sorry about the marker . AUDRIE: You have no idea what it's like to be a girl . An exchange with another classmate: . CLASSMATE: lol that shit gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah . AUDRIE: oh my god... i f***ing hate people... Do you know how people view me now?... I now have a reputation I can never get rid of. AUDRIE: My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how. Source: Rolling Stone magazine . In police interviews, the teenagers admitted . to coloring half of her face black with marker, then . pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the . time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days . later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has . revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and . has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom . she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.' When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person. 'She had been, literally, the best person . you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had . changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.' Another girl loudly pointed out in class that Audrie had been cutting herself, and the teenager burst out crying. She told friends she had cut herself on a vase.","Three unidentified teens pleaded guilty to charges that they sexually assaulted the teen a week prior to her suicide .

"By . Leon Watson . A former aide to the former first lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos has been jailed for trying to sell a stolen Claude Monet painting worth $32million. Disgraced secretary Vilma Bautista was convicted of illegally selling the 1899 painting . titled Japanese Footbridge Over Water Lily Pond in Giverny from Mrs . Marcos' vast collection. The artwork vanished in 1986 amid President Ferdinand Marcos’ overthrow and ended up in Bautista’s hands. Vilma Bautista (center) was convicted of illegally selling the 1899 painting titled Japanese Footbridge Over Water Lily Pond in Giverny . Former first lady Imelda Marcos didn't testify at Bautista's trial and knew nothing of the sale . It is part of a multibillion-dollar roster of property the Philippines government claims the Marcoses acquired with the nation's cash, prosecutors said. But during the trial, Bautista's defense lawyers claimed she was caught up in a clash between a government and its ousted leader. She was sentenced yesterday to two to six years behind bars. Bautista plans to appeal and has 'substantial issues' to raise, defense attorneys Susan and Fran Hoffinger said after the sentencing. Bautista also was ordered to pay about $3.5 million in state taxes. She was convicted in November of charges including conspiracy and tax fraud. The case 'finally solves the mystery of what happened to four masterpieces of Impressionist art,' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said then. Le Bassin aux Nympheas by Monet, painted in 1899. The former secretary to Imelda Marcos, Vilma Bautista, was convicted of trying to sell it . The 1899 Monet, from the French painter's famed 'Water Lilies' series, and other art ended up in Bautista's hands after vanishing when a 1986 'people power' revolt sent longtime President Ferdinand Marcos into exile in Hawaii. He died three years later. During his two decades in power, his wife became known for excess, symbolized by her huge collection of shoes. The Philippines claims the Marcoses acquired billions of dollars' worth of property with the nation's money. The country has spent years seizing companies, bank accounts and other assets believed to be part of that trove. Imelda Marcos (left), who was ousted from power along with her president husband in a 1986 coup, scandalized the world with her enormous shoe collection . U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who died in June 2004, escorts Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda as they depart the Oval Office at White House in 1982 . The Marcoses denied their wealth was ill-gotten, and Imelda Marcos has emerged relatively unscathed from hundreds of legal cases against her and her late husband. She is now a congresswoman in the Philippines. Bautista was a foreign service officer assigned to the Philippine Mission to the United Nations and later served as Imelda Marcos' New York-based personal secretary. By 2009, Bautista was mired in debt, and prosecutors said she resorted to trying to sell four paintings the Marcoses had acquired during the presidency. Besides the water lily painting, they included another Monet and works by Alfred Sisley and Albert Marquet. Bautista ultimately sold the water lily painting - 'Le Bassin aux Nymphease,' also known as 'Japanese Footbridge Over the Water-Lily Pond at Giverny' - for $32 million to a Swiss buyer. Some proceeds went to Bautista's debts, relatives and associates, and $15 million stayed in her bank accounts, prosecutors said. They said Imelda Marcos, who didn't testify at Bautista's trial, knew nothing of the sale. Bautista's lawyers said she believed that Imelda Marcos rightfully owned the paintings and that Bautista had authority to sell them for her. Bautista never had a chance to give Marcos the money, the defense said. The artworks' ownership is being determined in civil courts.","Artwork vanished in 1986 amid President Ferdinand Marcos' overthrow .

"By . James Salmon . Banks have threatened to charge for current accounts if they are broken up to create more competition . Banks have threatened to charge for current accounts if they are broken up to create more competition. And it is feared this would mean the poorest customers would be effectively dumped and left without an account. The Big Five banks – Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Santander and Barclays – have held a stranglehold over personal and small business customers for years. Consumer advocates say their domination allows them to rip off account holders by charging higher prices for overdrafts and small business loans. They also argue that customers suffer from too little choice. Plans to break up the banks are intended to introduce more competition and create a better deal for customers. The Independent Commission on Banking, led by Sir John Vickers, recommended the banks should be ring-fenced into retail divisions serving ordinary customers and ‘casino’ operations for City clients. He said if that does not work they should be broken up. Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected tomorrow to unveil reforms which could cap a bank’s market share to between 20 and 25 per cent, forcing them to offload branches to smaller rivals. It is thought Mr Miliband will also call for a Competition Commission inquiry but his proposals for a market cap have been criticised by the Conservatives and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee yesterday, Mr Carney said: ‘Just breaking up an institution doesn’t necessarily create or enable a more intensive competitive structure.’ A senior source at one of the biggest . banks said yesterday the reforms would lead to banks either getting rid . of their poorest and least profitable customers or charging them fees . they can ill afford. The Independent Commission on Banking, led by Sir John Vickers, recommended the banks should be ring-fenced into retail divisions serving ordinary customers and 'casino' operations for City clients . He said they will also increase pressure on lenders to introduce fees for all current account holders. Currently, four in five current accounts are free, while there are more than nine million basic bank accounts for poorer customers, who are only allowed to deposit and withdraw money, but cannot have an overdraft. These free accounts cater for lower earners, the unemployed and  those on benefits. One executive said: ‘If you go down this route the people who will suffer will be the lowest earners. This would be a disaster for financial inclusion and mean many people will be left without current accounts.’ Shadow Treasury Minister Chris Leslie hit back, saying: ‘It’s almost predictable that banks will stoop so low as to use these appalling scare tactics to preserve the status quo and avoid major reforms of the banking sector.’ But Tory MP Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘These simplistic, interventionist ideas show the economic illiteracy of the Labour leadership. 'It is inevitable that banks will become more selective about customers and many low earners could be frozen out of the market.’","Plans to break up the banks intended to introduce more competition and create a better deal for customers .

"By . Louise Boyle . and Daily Mail Reporter . Thousands of pages from the Sandy Hook school massacre were released today, revealing further details of gunman Adam Lanza's childhood. Among the police photographs were images of used paper targets from shooting ranges, which the 20-year-old was said to have visited with his mother, as well as a birthday card from his dad offering to take him shooting. In the brightly-colored birthday card . from Lanza's father, Peter, a message read: 'Adam, Happy Birthday - Send . me an email when you want to go hiking or shooting. Love, Dad.' It also revealed the extent of Lanza's mental illness with several witnesses speaking of an early fascination with destruction and violence. One teacher says his work was too violent to be shown to the rest of the class. Scroll down for video . A birthday card to Adam Lanza from his father which reads: 'Adam, Happy Birthday - Send me an email when you want to go hiking or shooting. Love, Dad' The front of the birthday card that Peter Lanza sent to his son Adam and was found at the gunman's home . Other photos and files showed that police found a stock of knives at the home and instruction manuals for the guns. In one chilling image, a wooden bed frame sits without the mattress above a row of women's shoes. It is known that Lanza shot dead his mother Nancy Lanza while she lay in bed before taking off on his rampage at the school. The day before the shooting she had stayed two days at a New Hampshire hotel as part of an experiment in letting her son stay home alone and be independent. She was shot four times in the head by her son the morning after she returned. The rifle used to kill her was found by police next to her bed. The sound of gunfire was reported between 8am and 9am that Friday, but it was believed to have been from hunters. Investigators reported that the windows of his second-floor room had been taped over with black trash bags. Windows on a computer room on the same floor had also been covered over. Police found a hard drive in that room that was so badly damaged that forensic experts doubt they will ever be able to recover the information. Spreadsheets about mass killings were . also found, which listed information about each case, and police found . handwritten notes listing the addresses of local gun shops. A GPS taken from the Lanza home showed a number of trips made between the family's house and schools in the area, according to documents released last month. On . December 13, a trip was recorded to Sandy Hook, the area where the . school was located, though it is not known who was driving or if they . went by the school. Lanza shot dead 20 first-graders and six educators with a semi-automatic . rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, before shooting himself.

State police released their report . totaling several thousand pages at 3pm on Friday, December 27, including text, crime . scene photos, audio tapes of 911 calls and video tapes of the . investigation. The . paperwork, photos and videos were heavily blacked out to protect the . names of children and to withhold some of the more grisly details of the . crimes. The report 'has been . redacted according to law'. Many photos, including 50 autopsy photos and 28 identification photos, have been blacked out. The release of Friday's documents concludes the state police's criminal investigation into the tragedy. Other photographs of the home Lanza shared with his mother show numerous rounds of ammunition, gun magazines, shot-up paper targets, gun cases, shooting earplugs and a gun safe with a rifle in it. In another of the evidence photos a stuffed teddy bear sits incongruously atop a gun storage closet. Peter Lanza, left, offered to take his son Adam, right, shooting in a birthday card message . A photo released by the Connecticut State Police shows what the evidence report describes as a view of a second floor bathroom and its contents including a photo identification of Adam Lanza and a cellular phone with battery removed . Personal items, including a card thanking Mrs Lanza for her time volunteering at the school were also documented. She had spent time at the school between 1998 and 2012, including a period when Lanza was a pupil there. 'Lanza apparently felt that his mother loved the students more than him,' the report said. Pictures believed to have been drawn by Lanza were also found in the family home. Prosecutors issued a summary of the investigation last month that portrayed Lanza as obsessed with mass murders but the report concluded that Lanza's motives for the massacre might never be known. Lanza 'was undoubtedly afflicted with mental health problems; yet despite a fascination with mass shootings and firearms, he displayed no aggressive or threatening tendencies', it said. His mother had said during a lunch . with friends just before the shooting that she never 'felt in any . personal danger living with Adam'. During . the lunch she had said she was planning on leaving Newtown, and . continuing to care for Lanza, perhaps in North Carolina or Washington . state. One of the drawings found inside Adam Lanza's home . Old newspaper clippings and a copy of Amish Grace, about a 2006 school shooting, was also found in the Lanza home . Books about Asperger syndrome, which Lanza had, were found in one of the bedrooms of the family home . Two weeks before the . shooting however, Mrs Lanza had confessed to a friend that her son was . becoming increasingly despondent and had was put 'over the edge' when . their house lost power during Hurricane Sandy. Another . friend told investigators that Mrs Lanza texted him a few days before . the shooting to say her son had bumped his head and they were 'dealing . with blood'. Books about . dealing with autism were found at the family's home and a nurse who met . Lanza four times in 2006 and 2007 had prescribed him anti-anxiety . medication. The nurse . said in her police interview that Lanza had been diagnosed with . obsessive compulsive disorder and was 'emotionally paralyzed', changing . his socks 20 times a day. Despite this his mother had stopped giving him the medication and failed to schedule follow up visits.

Among other disturbing elements of evidence to be revealed from a summary report last month, was the fact that in the fifth grade, Lanza wrote The Big Book of Granny, in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people, and another character talks of liking to hurt people, especially children. The book was among items seized from Lanza's home, but there was no indication he ever handed in the book at school. One of Lanza's former teachers told investigators that when asked to do creative writing at school he would write disturbing accounts. 'Adam would write ten pages, obsessing over battles, destruction and war,' the teacher said, according to the report. His work was 'so graphic that it could not be shared.' Lanza was also obsessed with the 1999 shooting at Columbine High in Colorado and other mass killings, the report said. The report also said that in 2005, . Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's disorder - an autism-like condition . that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for . others and behaved strangely. Nobody . was allowed into his room, not even to clean, according to the report. It said Lanza also disliked birthdays, Christmas and holidays and did . not like to have his hair cut. He . also wouldn't touch doorknobs, his food had to be arranged on the plate . in a certain way, and he changed clothes often during the day.

"By . Matt Blake . and Helen Pow . Michael Jackson's former housekeeper has agreed to back in court a choreographer's claim that the pop superstar molested him in the shower when he was a boy, it has been claimed. Blanca Francia, 57, says she walked in on The King of Pop showering with Australian Wade Robson, then eight, and has at last summoned up the courage to describe what she saw to a judge. Robson, 30, claims he was abused by Jackson for seven years who told him he'd go . to jail for the rest of his life if he told anyone about it. The choreographer approached Ms Francia to testify at his abuse civil lawsuit last week, according to reports, but only now has she agreed to do so, claiming Jackson also abused her son, Jason. She told the Daily Mirror: 'Michael Jackson abused Wade. My opinion has never wavered. We have been through a lot since then. 'They [Wade’s lawyers] would have to subpoena me to appear in the court case, but I would tell the same story. I will talk to them. I am still in shock that this has all happened.' Lawsuit: Wade Robson, pictured yesterday with his family, has launched a civil lawsuit against Jackson's estate claiming he was abused and staff from the pop singer's company should have protected him . Support? Robson's lawyers are approaching Jackson's former maid Blanca Francia, left, to back him, according to reports. Robson denied her claims Jackson showered with him in the star's 2005 trial, right, . It is understood two other members of Jackson's staff have also emerged from the woodwork with claims the 'Smooth Criminal' singer behaved inappropriately when child visitors came to the house. Personal maid Adrian McManus revealed staff talked openly  about Jackson’s bedtime antics with children while former ranch manager Mark Quindoy alleged he kissed a boy during a car trip in the early 1990s. Robson's lawsuit is a change of tune for Robson who . took to the stand as the first defense witness at a trial in 2005, where . Jackson was accused of molesting 13-year-old cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo. It was the same court case where Francia spoke out about seeing a young Robson in the shower with the singer. 'I walked in and they were in the shower,' Ms Francia told the court, according to a report from the time. 'When I saw it I saw clothes on the floor by the shower...underwear,' she said, adding that she recognized Jackson's and Robson's underclothes. According to TMZ in the maid's full written testimony she said she couldn't see what was happening in the shower but could hear Jackson laughing. Ms Francia's own son spoke at the court case in which Jackson was cleared of all 14 counts. Robson is planning to argue that Michael Jackson's companies -- MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures -- had a duty to protect him. However, his claims have been ridiculed by those close to the now deceased pop star. Debbie Rowe, 54, the ex-wife and mother of two of Jackson's children, criticized Robson on Thursday. Seven years of alleged abuse: Robson, pictured right with Jackson as a kid, said from the age of seven to around 14 Jackson 'performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him' She called the choreographer 'opportunistic' and said he was seeking publicity. She told TMZ on Thursday: 'It will be quickly forgotten, and will do nothing, nothing to tarnish Michael's extraordinary legacy.' Jackson's estate has called the claims 'outrageous and pathetic' while Jermaine Jackson has said that Robson is 'full of s***'. But Robson has been making his case too. He appeared on the Today program this week for a lengthy interview on why he is coming forward now and to outline his claims. He says from the age of seven to around 14, Jackson 'performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him'. Robson told Today Jackson . convinced him that 'both of us would go to jail for the rest of our . lives' if he told anyone about what they had done together. During the Arvizo case he adamantly denied that he had ever been molested or inappropriately . touched by the singer. Breaking his silence: Robson, right, told Matt Lauer, left, that he decided to break his silence about the alleged molestation after having his own son two years ago . Robson, now a top music choreographer . who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, said he hadn't yet come to terms with . what had happened to him. 'I said what I understood and I said what I was able to say,' he explained. 'From . seven years old, from day one of the abuse, Michael told me that we . loved each other and this was love, this was an expression of our love. And then he would follow it up with 'but if you ever tell anyone what we . are doing both of our lives and careers would be over'.' 'This is not a case of repressed . memory. I have never forgotten one moment of what . Michael did to me, but I was psychologically and emotionally completely . unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse.' He said having his own child two . years ago made him face up to the truth, as he said he couldn't help . thinking about how he'd feel if a stranger molested his little boy. 'I'm a father and I became a father . two and a half years ago to this beautiful baby boy and during the first . 18 months of his life I collapsed into two nervous breakdowns, . terrifying nervous breakdowns,' he said. Evidence: Jackson's case was backed by Robson at the star's 2005 trial, pictured entering court, over molestation claims . Idol: Robson, pictured as a young boy, was supported by Jackson who had him appear in numerous videos . 'At that point, I had no idea what . was going on. And for the first time in my life, I began to realize that . my completely numb and unexplored feelings about what Michael did to me . might be a problem and maybe I need to speak to somebody about it.' He has asked a . probate court to allow him to file a late creditor's claim against Jackson's . estate, even though the deadline has passed for creditors to file such . claims. The estate's lawyer, Howard Weitzman, has dismissed Robson's claims. In a statement Weitzman said: . 'This is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over . the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that Michael Jackson . never did anything inappropriate to him or with him. 'Now, nearly four years after Michael has passed, this sad and less-than-credible claim has been made.'. Robson said the ordeal of launching such a public case was too great for it to be about money. 'The idea that I would make all of this up and put myself, . my wife, my son, my entire family through this extremely stressful and . painful experience all for money is incomprehensible,' he said. 'I've lived in silence and denial for 22 . years and I can't spend another moment in that... I'm never going to go . away with this for the sake of money. I'm never going to be silenced for . money. That's not going to happen.' Robson's lawsuit comes as the high . profile trial of Michael Jackson's tour promoter, AEG, continues. The trial . is brought by the singer's mother and children who claim AEG shares . blame in his death for neglecting to vet and supervise Jackson's doctor, . Dr Conrad Murray. THEN . Wade Robson, who was then 22, testified in the Santa Maria courtroom that he was five when he met Jackson for the first time in his hometown, Brisbane, Australia. Two years later, he was a guest at Jackson's Neverland ranch for the first of some 20-plus overnight visits. He told jurors he shared a bed with Jackson on numerous occasions from the ages of seven to 14, at Neverland, as well as apartments in Los Angeles and at hotels in Las Vegas and LA. When asked by Jackson's lead lawyer, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., whether he'd ever been molested by the singer Robson replied: 'Absolutely not,' before also denying strongly that Jackson had ever touched him in a sexually explicit way. When senior deputy district attorney, Ronald J. Zonen, questioned Robson's account, he replied: 'I'm telling you, nothing ever happened.' Zonen then said, according to a New York Times article at the time: 'You're saying nothing ever happened when you were awake,' to which Robson responded: 'I think something like that would wake me up.' However, a former maid at Neverland who testified at the trial as a witness for the prosecution, said she had seen Jackson groping Robson in the shower at the ranch. But Robson denied ever having a shower with the star. NOW . But now Robson is claiming Michael Jackson did in fact molest him, over a period of seven years. In an interview with Today, Robson, . now 30, labelled Jackson 'a pedophile and a child sexual abuser' who from the ages of seven to around 14 'performed sexual . acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him.' He said that Jackson told him the alleged abuse was . 'an expression of our love.' Robson added, explaining why he gave what he claims now was a false testimony: 'This is not a case of repressed . memory. I have never forgotten one moment of what . Michael did to me, but I was psychologically and emotionally completely . unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse.' But he said he was never offered money to deny the abuse during the trial. 'There was no money, there was no ""you must lie."" Michael, when he would talk to me before these things were going on, and he would call me everyday... it was complete manipulation and brainwashing. It wasn't any sense of the truth on the phone, he would role play with me and train me for these scenarios.'","Wade Robson, 30, is mounting a civil lawsuit against the dead star's estate claiming he suffered years of abuse .

"Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was standing in a toilet cubicle facing the closed door when she was hit in the right hip by the first of four bullets fired by the double-amputee athlete, a police ballistics expert said on Wednesday. Captain Christiaan Mangena told . Pretoria's High Court that Ms Steenkamp then fell back on to a . magazine holder by the toilet before she was hit by a further two . bullets fired by Pistorius through the wood door. One bullet fired from the 9mm pistol struck her in the right arm and while another penetrated her skull as she crossed her arms over her head to protect herself, Captain Mangena said. Not listening: Oscar Pistorius appeared to place his thumbs in his ears as ballistic evidence about his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp's gunshot wounds are described to the court . Distressed: Pistorius wipes his eyes as ballistics expert Captain Christiaan Mangena tell his murder trial how Steenkamp was shot in the hip, arm and head . Alone: Pistorius sits in the dock on the 13th day of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria . As Mangena threw his hands up to . cover his head in court and replicate the 'defensive position' he said . Steenkamp took as the last shots were fired, Pistorius put his fingers . in his ears in an apparent attempt to block out the testimony. June . Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, also was in the courtroom and occasionally . glanced at photos of the bloody scene of her daughter's shooting before . looking away. Mr Mangena also testified that he believed the second bullet fired missed Ms Steenkamp . and ricocheted off a wall inside the cubicle and broke into fragments, . which caused bruising on her back. Mr . Mangena concluded, through his analysis of the shooting scene and . wounds on Ms Steenkamp's body from post-mortem photos, that one bullet . went through Ms Steenkamp's left hand before penetrating her skull as . she held it over her head. The policeman said he could not determine the order of the last two shots. Pistorius, . 27, is charged with premeditated murder over Ms Steenkamp's death on . February 14 last year and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. He . says he shot Ms Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his . bathroom because he thought she was a dangerous night-time intruder in . his home. Pistorius . says Ms Steenkamp went to use the toilet during the night without him . knowing, but prosecutors maintain he killed her after a loud argument . that caused her to possibly flee and hide in the toilet area. Mr . Mangena said the bullet that struck Ms Steenkamp's skull broke into two . fragments, one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her. The first shot into the right hip broke Ms Steenkamp's hip bone, Mr . Mangena said. 'I'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted, she dropped immediately,' Mr Mangena said. He . said Ms Steenkamp then slumped into a 'seated or semi-seated position' on top of a magazine rack near the toilet, where she was hit another two . times. Back in court: June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva Steenkamp, left, sits next to African National Congress Women's League spokesperson Jackie Mofokeng, right, as details of her daughter's death are described to the court . Questioning: State prosecutor Gerrie Nel questions ballistics experts Captain Christiaan Mangena over how Ms Steenkamp was killed . 'She ended up with her head on top of the toilet seat, and the lower part of her body on the rack', Mr Mangena said. Pistorius . fired from a distance of at least 60 centimetres (24in) and no further . than a wall behind him, about three metres (10ft) away, Mr Mangena said. He also described the impact of the type of bullets in Pistorius' gun, which were designed to cause maximum damage, he said. 'It . hits the target, it opens up, it creates six talons, and these talons . are sharp,' Mr Mangena said. 'It cuts through the organs of a human . being.' He noted the . Black Talon brand of ammunition was often used for self-defence because . while it caused significant damage to a human target, it was less likely . to penetrate the first target and hit other people. Mr . Mangena also said he conducted shooting tests to try to pinpoint the . location from which the bullets were fired by Pistorius in the bathroom, . based on where the cartridge cases were found. However, . in his tests, he said, the cases fell at different angles. He also . noted that the cartridge cases at the scene of Ms Steenkamp's shooting . could have been 'moved or kicked around' during the investigation. Together: Reeva Steenkamp pictured with Pistorius. The prosecution allege he intentionally killed her after an argument . Scene: Pistorius shot Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door at his home (above) in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year . He . said Pistorius was probably on his stumps when he fired, supporting the . athlete's statement that he was not wearing his prosthetic limbs when . he opened fire. Mr Nel . also asked Mr Mangena to comment on a 2012 incident in which Pistorius . allegedly fired his gun out of the sunroof of a moving car. The athlete . faces a firearms charge in that case, as well as two other firearms . charges. Mr Mangena said firing a shot in such circumstances was dangerous. The . bullet leaves the barrel at around 280 metres (900 feet) a second, and . will travel upward, then stop and fall to the ground under the force of . gravity and wind deflection, he said. 'The bullet can still kill a person,' Mr Mangena said. The trial has been adjourned until Monday.

"By . Ian Ladyman . Another day, another problem to address for Manchester United and their imperilled manager David Moyes. This time it was stories — quickly denied — of a falling-out with one of his coaches, Ryan Giggs. The United icon — so the rumour went — vented his spleen at Moyes in the Old Trafford dressing room in the wake of Sunday’s limp defeat by Liverpool. ‘Ryan is absolutely fuming over suggestions of a falling-out with the manager,’ said a United spokesman on Monday. VIDEO: Scroll down for Moyes and Evra speaking ahead of Wednesday's Champions League tie . It never rains but it pours: David Moyes was forced to deny rumours that he had a bust-up with Ryan Giggs in the wake of Sunday's home defeat to Liverpool . All smiles: Moyes and Giggs appeared to be getting along fine as United trained on Tuesday morning ahead of their Champions League tie with Olympiacos at Old Trafford . Larks: Wayne Rooney laughs with Giggs as he rolls on the floor during training at Carrington . When will the misery end? David Moyes cut a forlorn figure on the Manchester United bench as they slumped to a 3-0 home defeat by Liverpool on Sunday . Holding his hand up? Moyes potentially has 10 days to save his job at Old Trafford . Can't watch: Ryan Giggs was an unused substitute against Liverpool . As it turned out, Giggs was jogging . on the pitch with other unused players when Moyes and his team began . their dissection of Sunday’s disaster. Even the Welshman can’t argue down the . length of a players’ tunnel and through a brick wall. As . one fire goes out, however, other burning problems do not go away for . Moyes. Fresh from Sunday’s 3-0 surrender to Liverpool, Moyes must raise . his team for Wednesday’s Champions League visit of Olympiacos. Then, . on Saturday, is a visit to West Ham in the Barclays Premier League . followed by the arrival of Manchester City next Tuesday. If it sounds . daunting for Moyes, that’s because it is. In the directors’ box on Sunday, United officials looked on aghast as the team succumbed meekly, while in the corporate lounges, guests from each of the club’s top sponsors — invited especially for the day — must have wondered what the champions have been spending their money on. The official line from United is that Moyes remains in no immediate danger. The plan, we are told, remains a long-term one. The United manager, though, is in trouble, do not think otherwise, and a succession plan may well be put in place within 10 days if things continue to go badly. Long walk: David Moyes reflects on another disappointing defeat by Liverpool as his troubles continue . Disaster: United's player trudge back to the centre circle after Steven Gerrard scores Liverpool's first goal from the penalty spot at Old Trafford . Wayne Rooney said Sunday’s 3-0 defeat was ‘one of the worst days I’ve ever had in football’. But Rooney has not had a good day at Old Trafford in a while. The last time he scored there was on October 26. Since then, 22 players have scored at Old Trafford: . UNITED: Javier Hernandez (4), Danny Welbeck (3), Robin van Persie (3), Ashley Young (2), Phil Jones (2), Fabio, Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia, Jonny Evans, Adnan Januzaj. OPPONENTS: Gerrard (Liverpool, 2) Oviedo (Everton), Cabaye (Newcastle), C Cole (West Ham), Adebayor,  Eriksen (Tottenham), Routledge, Bony (Swansea),  Bardsley (Sunderland), Sidwell, Bent (Fulham), Suarez (Liverpool). On social networking sites and fan . forums on Monday, the groundswell of opinion against Moyes continued to . grow. Even the more rational are beginning to tire of United’s insipid . football and a manager who rarely seems to say or do anything to inspire . confidence in his ability to reverse a downward trend. However, the remarkable and prolonged . support afforded United from the Stretford End during the last 10 . minutes of Sunday’s defeat has worked in Moyes’s favour. It . was noted by the Old Trafford directors as a tick in a column of . positives that was looking as empty as some of United’s performances. What . is abundantly clear is that nobody at United — apart from the odd . disaffected player — wants to see Moyes sacked. What is also apparent, . however, is that United will have to get rid of him if things don’t . improve quickly. As United fans and officials stare down the A580 at their resurgent Merseyside rivals, they can comfort themselves with the fact that, while Liverpool remain a big and important football club, United have grown into an international financial monster. As such, the defending champions are in a position to throw millions of pounds at their problems this summer. The only question is whether they can — or should — trust Moyes to spend it. Moyes’s United have a shambolic look about them and they are getting worse. Other Premier League coaches talk privately of unimaginative tactics and square pegs in round holes. And the rumours may not be true, but it . nevertheless remains the case that Giggs has appeared to be a rather . distant, detached figure at Old Trafford of late. Support: It appears Moyes is not getting the backing he needs from either the players or the fans . Hurting: Giggs is said to be upset by United's slump and there has even been suggestion he could replace Moyes as manager . Unveiled as part of the new world . order when Moyes succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson last May, the 40-year-old . has been increasingly less visible on the touchline and indeed as a . player as crisis has followed crisis at Old Trafford. One . theory is that Giggs may yet be the next United manager — temporarily . or otherwise — and is merely biding his time. That, though, doesn’t fit . with what we know of a loyal United servant who, rather like his friend . Gary Neville, takes every defeat, at whatever level, as a personal . affront. Schooled at The Cliff, Carrington and Old Trafford, Giggs knows that success comes . in cycles. He hasn’t seen much like this during his 23 years at . first-team level, though. Dressing-room arguments — real or invented — . pale into insignificance when the team are 18 points from the top of the . Premier League.","David Moyes has three vital matches in next week to hang on to his job .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . With its tips on styling the 'wedge' and the 'flick', gentle celebrity gossip and advice on how to snare the boy next door, 70s teen magazine, Jackie, was the lifestyle bible for a generation of girls. Although the title folded in 1993, it remains one of the most popular teen titles ever made, selling 600,000 copies a week at the peak of its popularity. Half a century after it first launched, Jackie is back in the news with commentators offering a retrospective look at the title and what it meant to them as the magazine's 50th birthday approaches. Familiar: Early editions, including this May 1964 copy, featured familiar names such as Paul McCartney . Writing in the Telegraph, journalist Victoria Lambert remembers the 'fabulous mix of fashion, photo stories, pop gossip and beauty tips' offered to teen readers. She adds: 'Where else could a girl from Middle England learn about the merits of triple denim, especially in waistcoat form, as modelled by Status Quo?' But as regular readers knew, there was more to Jackie than triple denim and pop gossip. The magazine also broke new ground by including sex and relationship advice - introduced after contraception was made free on the NHS in 1974. Its 'Dear Doctor' column covered everything from information on periods to how to avoid getting pregnant with much more in between. Groundbreaking: Jackie, which folded in 1993, was one of the first to include content on sex and relationships . Teen dream: Donny Osmond (left) and David Cassidy both made regular appearances in Jackie during the 70s . Speaking to the BBC, Maria Welch, who worked on Jackie from 1987 to 1992, explained: 'Jackie was the blueprint for the teenage magazines that we see today. 'When Jackie was selling millions of copies in the 1970s, I think lots of teenagers were feeling a bit disconnected. 'There was no internet, there was no social networking so it was very difficult to find out if your problems were ones you were having alone, or were other girls having them too?' Although modern teen magazines have struggled, with market leader Sugar going entirely online in 2011, the legacy of Jackie - and nostalgia for its 70s heyday - remains. As Taylor puts it: 'No wonder the magazine’s nostalgia market survives with annuals and CD compilations still available. 'Who else is yet to be discovered wearing a tight pullover and a winsome expression in its pages? A young Tony Blair?' One can only hope not.

"By . Tara Brady . Guilty: Sir George Castledine started a relationship with an 83-year-old widow out of sexual desire and financial greed, a panel has ruled . A knighted nurse who had an affair with an 83-year-old widow he was counselling following the death of her husband was struck off today. Sir George Castledine, 67, declared his love for the recently bereaved woman, known during regular visits to her home and called her ‘my little tinkerbell.’ Sir George, who shook his head as the decision was announced, has been thrown out of the profession and cannot apply to be restored to the register for five years. Susan Hurds, NMC panel chairman said: ‘Your actions represent a serious departure from the standards expected from a registered nurse. ‘You have been dishonest during the course of this investigation and were deliberately evasive and inconsistent while giving evidence. ‘You have shown no remorse for your actions and the effect they have had on Patient A and her family. ‘You have a distinguished career of over 40 years as an author, clinician, educator and mentor and have made a substantial contribution to the nursing profession, including care for older people. ‘The misconduct was wide-ranging and continued beyond the limits outlined in the charges, you continued to see Patient A after receiving written instructions not to. ‘You sought to mislead the panel and you lied to the panel during these proceedings. ‘During your evidence to the panel you tried to blame Patient A for pestering you. ‘You have failed to satisfy the panel that you are remorseful and that there will be no repetition of the misconduct. ‘Your actions are so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with your remaining on the register. ‘A striking off order is the only proportionate sanction.’ Sir George Castledine declared his love for the recently bereaved woman and told her he needed to work out at the gym so he could 'make love' to her. Treatment: Sir George first started working with the widow at Onneley House in Birmingham in November 2008 . He denied that his behaviour was motivated by financial gain or sexual desire - but a committee sitting at the Old Bailey in London has now ruled that this was in fact false. Sir George regularly visited the elderly patient and showered her with gifts and flowers, accepting thousands of pounds in return. The woman's family became so concerned about his behaviour that they bugged her phone - and heard him calling her 'Tinkerbell' and saying he had to go to the gym or he 'wouldn't be able to make love' to her. NMC panel chairman Susan Hurds said today that he had 'manipulated a vulnerable patient' while motivated by sexual gratification and greed. She added that the woman, known as 'Patient A', was 'clearly grief-stricken' following the death of her husband, and needed bereavement counselling which Sir George was not qualified to give. 'You gave evidence which the panel often found difficult to believe,' Mrs Hurds told Sir George. 'You lacked consistency in your response, added evidence and altered your story as it suited you. 'We concluded that you lied at the outset of the investigation and as the hearing continued. As evidence was put before you you modified your account. 'The panel finds it incredible that the endearments and erotic language you used at no other time than on the occasions on the tape. 'You were deliberately evasive and not consistent but intentionally changed your story.' She added: 'The persistent nature of the telephone calls, late at night and early in the morning and the giving of gifts and eating together in an intimate setting were sexually motivated.'

Sir George, currently a visiting professor at Glyndwr University in Wrexham, insisted that his chats with Patient A were nothing more than 'banter'. He told the hearing: 'Some of the phone calls later were sexual in some respects but it wasn't an offer of having sex with somebody or anything like that. 'One of the times I spoke to her she was having some trouble so I called her and on the telephone we would have banter. It was a befriending role that I had and I was befriending her.' The nurse had previously admitted the contents of his conversations with the woman, and confessed that he had continued to see her even after he was told not to by an official. Sir George formerly sat on the Welsh board of a predecessor to the NMC, and helped draw up the code of conduct for nursing which he has now breached. He is a former assistant dean of the nursing faculty at Birmingham City University, and an ex-consultant at Dudley Group of Hospitals.","Sir George Castledine, 67, counselled the woman after her husband died .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Spurs legend Gary Lineker has said that Tim Sherwood's policy of slagging off his players in public may well backfire on him. The Tottenham boss had said on Wednesday that his squad were playing for their future after their humiliating 4-0 defeat to Chelsea on Saturday.

"By . Jaymi Mccann . A member of the notorious 'Pink Panther' jewel thief gang escaped from a Swiss prison after accomplices rammed a gate and overpowered guards with bursts from their AK-47s, police said Friday. Bosnian national Milan Poparic, 34, fled from the Orbe prison in the western canton of Vaud. He is the third member of the Pink Panthers to escape from a Swiss prison in as many months, according to Vaud police. Milan Poparic (left) was one of the Pink Panthers. he fled with Adrian Abrecht (right) from the Orbe prison . Poparic had robbed a jewellery store in Neuchatel, Switzerland (pictured) in 2009 . He escaped with with fellow inmate Adrian Albrecht, 52 on Thursday. Poparic had been serving a sentence of six years and eight months for robbing a jewellery store in the Swiss city of Neuchatel in 2009. Albrecht was serving a seven-year prison sentence for various crimes including robbery, arson and money laundering. Police said Poparic was part of the Pink Panthers network, prime suspects in a series of spectacular thefts. According to Interpol the group has targeted luxury watch and jewelry stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States, netting over 330 million euros ($436 million) since 1999. The two accomplices rammed the compound with two vehicles, clearing away barbed wire for the escape, then fled with the two escapees in one vehicle and set fire to the other. Inspired: Interpol dubbed them the 'Pink Panther' gang, recalling the 1963 movie starring Peter Sellers as the bungling Inspector Clouseau . Teams of police and other authorities from Switzerland and France, some using police dogs, are searching for them. At . a news conference Friday, Beatrice Metraux, head of Vaud's interior . department that includes responsibility for prisons, said the guards . were unarmed but were backed up by officers from the Swiss private . security firm Protectas, who were equipped with 'simple handguns' that . were no match for the AK-47s. She said the escapees hadn't received any visits in recent months other than from their lawyers. 'This is an invasion, rather than an escape, orchestrated by a heavily armed organized gang,' she said, adding that the staff was shocked and one person was getting psychological counseling. Vaud police spokesman Jean-Christophe Sauterel said the vehicle remains missing, and it's not known which way they fled. It's still unclear, he added, whether the two accomplices are members of the Pink Panthers, although their actions suggest it. Interpol dubbed them the 'Pink Panther' gang, recalling the 1963 movie starring Peter Sellers as the bungling Inspector Clouseau, but it isn't known whether members themselves use that name. The gang is believed to have a core membership of about 40 people, many of them from the Balkans. Sauterel said there doesn't appear to be any danger to the public, since killing isn't part of the Pink Panthers' usual methods. But, he added, the police are 'dealing with people who were involved in the armed forces during the war in former Yugoslavia.' In mid-May, two members of the Pink Panthers - a 45-year-old Serb, who was being temporarily detained for aggravated robbery, and a 47-year-old Frenchman held for aggravated robbery and drug and weapons violations - escaped from the Bois-Mermet prison along with three others, helped by accomplices, the police said.","Milan Poparic, 34, fled from Orbe prison in Vaud, west Switzerland .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . and James Chapman . The future of the BBC Trust is to be reviewed after an ‘annus horribilis’ for the corporation, the Culture Secretary said last night. In a scathing response to the payoff debacle, Maria Miller said the corporation’s handling of executive pay was ‘just not good enough’ and serious questions had been raised about the judgment of its top managers. She said she planned to strengthen the legal powers of the National Audit Office to allow it to demand access to all BBC documents whenever it wanted. In response to her comments, the BBC . announced plans to ‘re-examine’ the relationship between its executive . board and its governing body. Warning: Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the scandal of BBC pay-offs raised serious questions about the judgement of the Corporation's bosses . On Monday, seven current and former . BBC chiefs were called before MPs to explain why it handed £369million . in severance deals to its staff, including £25million to 150 top . managers. She said she planned to strengthen the legal powers of the National Audit Office to allow it to demand access to all BBC documents whenever it wanted. Miss Miller said the past year – in . which the corporation also came under fire over the Jimmy Savile child . abuse revelations and a failed £100million IT project – had been an . ‘annus horribilis’, the Latin phrase used by the Queen to describe the . Royal Family’s traumatic year in 1992. Speaking to the Royal Television . Society’s annual conference in Cambridge, Miss Miller  said: ‘This has . undoubtedly been one of the most challenging years in its history. Monday was a grim day for its senior management. Ultimately, licence-fee . payers rely not only upon the right structures and governance being in . place but also upon the BBC’s executive management using their good . judgment. Line-up: The seven serving and former BBC executives were hauled in for the 'extraordinary' hearing as MPs struggled to get to the truth . ‘And I think serious questions were . raised about that judgment by the scale of the severance payments made. Licence-fee payers expect their money to be spent properly. This has . been an annus horribilis for the BBC. But we all know that institutions . can recover and come back stronger from years like that. The BBC will . bounce back.’ Speaking to the Daily Mail before her . speech, Miss Miller said the severance scandal arose from confusion . between the BBC Executive and the Trust, which is led by Chris Patten. She said: ‘It’s simply not acceptable that confusion is there. ‘I will keep the governance . arrangements under review. When you have the National Audit Office . saying they have weak governance, it’s time to take that seriously.’ Defiant: Mark Thompson became increasingly animated during the grueling three-hour committee grilling . Dispute: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten blamed a . 'culture' of extravagance at the Corporation which was used to justify . huge pay and perks . The full scale of the severance pay . scandal emerged in July after the government spending watchdog conducted . a six-month investigation into executive payoff deals. But the audit office was blocked from . looking at the details of several payoffs, including money handed to . former director of vision Jana Bennett. It emerged last week Miss . Bennett was secretly handed £700,000 by the BBC while the audit office . was still conducting its investigation. Miss Miller said such secrecy was . ‘unacceptable’, adding: ‘I believe we must look for the NAO to have a . significant statutory role where nothing can stop them looking at what . they want, when they want.’ In a letter to Miss Miller yesterday, . BBC director general Tony Hall said he would launch a ‘comprehensive . review’ into the relationship between the corporation and the Trust, but . insisted the existing governance structure was fit for purpose. He admitted: ‘The last few days have . not seen the BBC at its best. The recent NAO report and Public Accounts . Committee hearings have highlighted questions about whether the BBC’s . current system of governance has worked as effectively as it clearly . should. ‘The Trust and Executive Board have agreed that we should now re-examine the relationship between the two parts of the BBC.’","Maria Miller warns pay-offs scandal raises doubts about BBC's judgement .

"By . Ian Drury . A British soldier fired shots, made death threats and hit Iraqi prisoners after they were captured on the battlefield, an inquiry into alleged war crimes heard today. The former military intelligence officer is accused of inflicting the abuse while questioning nine detainees at Camp Abu Naji, a UK base in southern Iraq, in May 2004. The ex-serviceman - identified only by the codename M004 - admitted trying to 'frighten and intimidate' the insurgents in a bid to prise crucial information from them. He said he used a 1ft-long metal tent peg to bang on a table top and shouted and screamed at detainees as part of his 'tactical questioning' technique. A British soldier fired shots, made death threats and hit Iraqi prisoners after they were captured on the battlefield, an inquiry into alleged war crimes has heard. He is accused of inflicting the abuse while questioning nine detainees at Camp Abu Naji (above), a UK base in southern Iraq, in May 2004 . But he told the long-running Al-Sweady Inquiry that he 'categorically denied' striking or physically threatening any of the prisoners. The soldier, who served in the Army for 24 years, has been accused by several Iraqi captives of firing two pistol shots into the ground while they were being questioned in a tent at the military camp. There were also allegations by a detainee that M004 beat him with a metal pipe and another claimed he was warned he would be executed if he did not tell the truth. He said: 'It is a complete fabrication to say that two shots were fired. This did not happen. I never fired a weapon or allowed anyone else to fire a weapon in the tactical questioning tent. 'There is no feasible way that a shot could be fired in the tent without someone hearing it and it being reported and discussed throughout the camp. 'I categorically deny ever hitting any of the detainees, nor did I see any other soldiers beat and/or kick any detainees. I did not threaten a detainee with execution.' Retired High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes is examining allegations that UK troops executed up to 20 prisoners, including a 14-year-old boy, and mistreated nine others after a battle at an Army checkpoint. The inquiry is named after 19-year-old Hameed Al-Sweady, one of those who died after a firefight between UK soldiers and insurgents at the Danny Boy checkpoint three miles north of the town of Majar Al Kabir. The inquiry is looking at claims that Iraqis were unlawfully killed at Camp Abu Naji and that five Iraqi detainees were tortured and ill-treated there, and at a detention facility at Shaibah Logistics Base (above, file picture) It is looking at claims that Iraqis were unlawfully killed at Camp Abu Naji and that five Iraqi detainees were tortured and ill-treated there, and at a detention facility at Shaibah Logistics Base. The claims have been strenuously denied by the Ministry of Defence which says the victims were insurgents killed in battle. M004 had no involvement with the deaths of any Iraqis during the disputed events of May 14, 2004. His evidence is confined to the treatment of detainees. He had carried out the 'tactical questioning' of all nine detainees in the aftermath of the battle. Each interrogation lasted up to 17 minutes. The witness said the tent peg was never used to strike a detainee but he said banging it on a table behind the prisoner was intended to scare them and 'soften' them up. He said a questioning technique called 'harshing' routinely involved walking behind the detainee, blowing on the back of their neck, banging the tent peg down on the table and then screaming and shouting over their left shoulder and into their ear. Blowing on the detainee's neck allowed the interrogator to get inside the prisoner's personal space so that he could feel the questioner's presence, something which was 'remarkably effective' he said. The aim was to keep detainees in a state of uncertainty so they would not feel too comfortable and clam up. Questioners were trying to discover information about insurgent weapons, armed gangs and planned attacks on UK troops. But M004 told the counsel to the inquiry that he did not believe some of the tactics would be 'permissible' today because the rules had been changed. The hearing, in central London, has already heard evidence from Iraqis, including relatives and medical staff, and military personnel. Evidence from military witnesses will continue until March. It is hoped the inquiry report will be finished by the end of the year.","Ex-military intelligence officer .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Terrorists today said they planned to execute a French spy who has been held captive in Somalia for years - and who French authorities believe is already dead. Al-Shabaab, a Somali-based group linked to al-Qaeda, said on Twitter that France 'signed his death warrant' by attempting to launch a rescue operation over the weekend. The bid to rescue the agent, codenamed Denis Allex, failed dramatically and two French commandos were killed in the operation. Scroll down for video .

In its statement today, al-Shabaab claimed that Allex, who was kidnapped in July 2009, is alive and had been in another safe house that was not targeted by the French rescue force. And it said the group had 'reached a unanimous decision' on the man's fate this weekend. The planned execution is also to avenge what al-Shabaab called France's 'persecution' of Muslims at home and around the world - including in Mali, north Africa, where French troops today launched an assault on rebels.

His . first appeal in 2010, a year after he was captured, saw him call on . then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to drop his backing for the former colony. Then, . in July 2012, looking gaunt, he sent a video message to new President . Francois Hollande, telling how his hopes of a rescue were fading by the . day. He calls on France to drop its 'oppressive attitude' towards Muslims and says Mr Hollande represented his last hope of rescue. Poignantly, he adds: 'I am alive. But for how long?' French authorities believe he is now dead after the botched raid this weekend by French commandos. French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours of Saturday, 12 January. Their mission was to free the agent but  within minutes of arriving, the commandos were involved in a firefight that saw a soldier killed. Up to 17 Somalis were killed in scenes reminiscent of the battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which is commonly referred to as Black Hawk Down  after a book and film about the incident. Then, a US army force  tried to seize Somali warlords in the city but two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters  were shot down, resulting  in the deaths and wounding of 18 Americans, and up to  3,000 Somalis. Those involved in the attack were members of militant  Islamist group Al-Shabab,  the Somalian representatives of Al Qaeda. French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ‘A French commando was killed and another is missing.’ Despite earlier French claims about Mr Allex being killed, Al-Shabab insisted he was still alive – and had not even been in the village. In a statement, the group said it had ‘killed several’ French soldiers and that Mr Allex was ‘safe and far from the location of the battle’.

"By . Helen Collis . The body of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died last week in Italy aged 100, should be sent to Germany and incinerated, the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre said in an interview. Efraim Zuroff, who heads the Jewish . Nazi-hunting organisation, told La Stampa daily's Monday edition that . Germany had the 'best laws' to avoid the funeral becoming a neo-Nazi . rally. The former Nazi SS captain admitted shooting two . people during the mass murder of 335 civilians in Italy during WWII but said he was only . following orders. He has denied the Holocaust. Hatred: Riot police set of tear gas to subdue the crowds outside the funeral for former SS officer Erich Priebke in Albano Laziale, a suburb of Rome . Justice served: The former SS captain at his 1996 conviction . 'The best thing would be to send the body back to Germany for it to be incinerated,' Zuroff said. 'That would be the most efficient way to leave no trace of a Nazi criminal like Priebke,' he said. 'Hitler's . body was also burnt and that was the best solution because it allowed . the destruction of everything Nazism represented,' he said. Efraim Zuroff, who heads the Jewish Nazi-hunting organisation, has called for Priebke to be incinerated in Germany . Priebke's lawyer had initially said that the former SS officer could be buried in Argentina, where he lived after the Second World War. But Argentina said it would not accept his remains. Rome religious authorities have also said there can be no church funeral for Priebke in the city. After the war, Priebke escaped from a British POW camp and was supplied with Vatican travel documents by a Catholic bishop. He lived in Argentina as a free man, evading arrest for nearly 50 years. He was finally extradited to Italy from Argentina in 1995 to face trial for the Fosse Ardeatine massacre of 335 civilians, and he was sentenced to life in prison. However he served that sentence under house arrest at the Rome home of his lawyer, Paolo Giachini. Giachini announced the death and released a final interview conducted with Priebke in July during which the German denied that Nazis gassed Jews during the Holocaust and accused the West of having fabricated the crimes to minimize the Allies' own abuses during the war. Priebke was tried and convicted for his . role in the 1944 massacre of 335 civilians by Nazi forces at the . Ardeatine Caves outside Rome. A row has raged for days over the officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase . Fascist followers: Italian King Victor Emanuel III, (right) Adolf Hitler (centre) and Benito Mussolini (left) The massacre was carried out in retaliation for an attack by resistance fighters that killed 33 members of a Nazi military police unit a day earlier. Priebke admitted shooting two people and rounding up victims, but insisted he was only following orders. He long felt like he had been scapegoated, since many other Germans who had participated in the massacre weren't convicted, another lawyer, Carlo Taormina, told The Associated Press. Death: Erich Priebke, who carried out one of Italy's worst massacres, died today aged 100 . Outrage: In the lead up to his birthday Jewish groups called for celebrations to be banned . 'The dignity with which he withstood . his persecution made him an example of courage, coherence and loyalty,' Giachini said in the statement. The Fosse Ardeatine massacre was a mass execution carried out on 24 March 1944 by German occupation troops during the Second World War after an attack conducted the previous day in central Rome against the SS Police Regiment Bozen. The massacre was perpetrated in what was then a little-frequented rural suburb of the city, inside the tunnels of the disused quarries of pozzolana, near the Via Ardeatina. By mistake, 335 Italian prisoners were taken, five more than the 330 called for. Led by SS officers Erich Priebke and Karl Hass, they were transported to the Ardeatine caves in truckloads and shot in groups of five. Many of the German officers had never killed before, so Kappler ordered several cases of cognac to calm their nerves. Many civilians were forced to kneel down over the bodies of those who had been killed before them. During the day of killing, SS officers became drunk and there were reports of some victims' heads being blown off while others were not immediately killed. One prisoner, a deserter from the Austrian army was allowed to live; the five surplus prisoners were murdered to prevent news of the location of the massacre. One officer, who refused to shoot, was personally dragged to the execution site by Priebke, who forced him to kill his victim. The officers then blew up the entrance to the caves to seal off the evidence. The Ardeatine Caves site (Fosse Ardeatine), declared a Memorial Cemetery and National Monument, is open to visitors. Priebke . had escaped in 1946 from a British prison camp in Rimini, a resort town . on Italy's Adriatic coast, and had lived in Argentina for nearly 50 . years before a U.S. television programme reported that he was living . freely in the country. That started a lengthy extradition process that ended with him boarding a plane in Argentina on Nov. 20, 1995, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg trials, to stand trial in Italy. The country's highest appeals court upheld his conviction and life sentence in 1998. He was allowed to serve the term under house arrest due to his age, but was subsequently given small freedoms such as going to church and doing personal shopping - concessions that outraged Rome's Jewish community. Mr Zuroff, the Simon Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi hunter who just this year launched a new push to search for unpunished war criminals, said Priebke's case proves it is never too late to seek justice. 'Priebke's death at the age of 100 should be a powerful reminder that some of the worst perpetrators of the crimes of the Holocaust live to a healthy old age and that a person's chronological age should never prevent them from being held accountable for their crimes, if they are healthy enough to be brought to justice,' he said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. 'Priebke was a classic example of a totally unrepentant Nazi war criminal.' In his final interview, Priebke denied that gas chambers were used in Nazi concentration camps and that generations have been 'brainwashed' into believing that they were. He acknowledged he could be prosecuted for denying the Holocaust, but said such laws 'demonstrate fear of the truth coming out'.","Erich Priebke was convicted for his part in the massacre of 335 civilians .

"By . Graham Poll . There was nothing surprising or unexpected in watching Alan Pardew explode with rage at St James’ Park this weekend. The Newcastle United manager has two distinct sides to his character: a sort of Jekyll and Hyde. The one seen away from the heat of battle is a smiling, charming, innocent ‘cheeky chap’ who is ‘doing ever so well’ on limited resources at Newcastle. The other will do whatever is needed to try to wring out any advantage for his team. As we have seen, he is also prone to combustible behaviour — and he seems to think that whatever is said or insinuated when under pressure can be forgiven and forgotten with an apology. Blast: Manuel Pellegrini (left) was on the receiving end of an absuive tirade from Alan Pardew (right) Unsavoury: Pardew later apologised for calling Pellegrini a 'f****** old c***' Bone of contention: Pardew was raging because referee Mike Jones disallowed Cheick Tiote's goal . I remember Pardew best for his comments in the tunnel at half-time, when he was always looking to sow seeds of doubt and open up the possibility of gaining his side an advantage. He would try to influence you by painting the picture that his team were already getting the rough end of the stick. Those observations were delivered ‘in passing’ and usually out of earshot of others, which tended to make them hard to ignore and impossible to report. He certainly put his own slant on one particular match when I was refereeing his Charlton team and the whole episode left me open to accusations of favouring his team. After that game at The Valley between Charlton and Reading, Pardew said how well I had done in signalling to the bench that one of his players, the on-loan Alex Song, was one foul away from a red card. This, he said, had afforded him the opportunity to replace Song. I had no issue with what had happened, but he made it appear that we had arranged the whole thing in the tunnel at half-time, which was untrue. Giving some back: Pellegrini and Pardew had a fiery exchange of words on the touchline . It's not over yet: Pardew pointed the finger as Jones made his way down the tunnel at half-time . History: Graham Poll (left) talks to then West Ham manager Pardew after a 0-0 draw at Fulham in 2004 . Before the 2004 First Division play-off final, when he was manager of West Ham, Pardew had a word with me about Tomas Repka at the exchange of team sheets. We all knew Repka was a physical player whose effectiveness was often nullified after a yellow card, so Pardew tried to pressurise me into not cautioning him on such a big stage. Repka was the first West Ham player cautioned that afternoon. Pardew had every cause to complain after Mike Jones disallowed a perfectly good goal for offside on Sunday. It would have equalised Manchester City’s opening effort and put Newcastle back in the match. But there can be no defence of the disgraceful outburst to which Pardew subjected City manager Manuel Pellegrini. One can only assume that Martin Atkinson, the fourth official, did not hear the comment, which was picked up on TV. Perhaps Atkinson’s hearing was muffled by his ‘beanie’ hat. Being the fourth official in the middle of warring managers is an almost impossible task, made even more difficult by the trend not to report players — let alone managers — for abusive or insulting comments. The last thing the referee needs is to be called over to the technical area to dismiss a manager, particularly the home one after denying them a goal. He’s better off in the middle, away from the angry crowd — and there are few more vocal than the Toon Army. Imagine the reaction if Atkinson had reported Pardew to Jones and they had removed him from the technical area. Friend or foe? Jose Mourinho, during his first spell at Chelsea, gives Graham Poll an earful at Stamford Bridge . On the receiving end: Sir Alex Ferguson was renowned for his bullish approach with match officials . Atkinson found himself in a tough position, one that wasn’t helped by the fact that there really has been no clear directive on what is and what is not seen as acceptable behaviour. Too much is left to interpretation, which encourages managers to push their luck. Pardew was not the first, nor the only manager, to try to get inside my head. Arsene Wenger adopted a similar approach, carefully making a comment at a time he thought it would have maximum impact and might influence your thinking. His demeanour and gravitas meant he was more effective than Pardew, complaining and pleading for more protection for his players. It was delivered so well that you often found yourself giving more free-kicks to Arsenal early in the second half. Sir Alex Ferguson was quite the opposite: subtlety was not a tool he employed. It was full-frontal, in-your-face fury. The first season I refereed at Old Trafford he was into my dressing room after the final whistle to give me the full ‘hairdryer’ treatment over the fact that I had not added on enough time. United drew that game! Wily: Mourinho's preferred tactic was to befriend officials in a bid to curry favour on the pitch . Jose Mourinho worked quite differently: he wanted you to think of him as a friend — and as a result he expected favours, which meant he would be hurt when you dealt with his team in exactly the same way as any other. In his first pre-season at Stamford Bridge he invited me to a meeting with all of his players and introduced me as the best referee in Europe! As for Pardew, he is well aware that he went way too far and his apology should not have prevented the FA from imposing a touchline ban. Whatever the provocation, however bad the decision, all managers must remember their position and keep their composure and dignity. Game over: Alvaro Negredo netted City's second goal to kill off Pardew's Newcastle side at St James' Derided: Mike Jones (centre) deals with Tim Krul (right) and Tiote during the clash . Bad day: Mike Jones made the wrong call for Newcastle's 'goal' The incident has led to calls for the offside law to be revised.  But the law is clearly defined and needs no adjustment — it just needs to be applied correctly. This is the law in its simplest form: . When the ball is played forward to a colleague in the opponents’ half of the field: . WHY MIKE JONES GOT IT WRONG . Three Newcastle players were in offside positions when the ball was played forward, but they should not have been penalised as they did not touch the ball, interfere with opponents or obstruct Joe Hart’s line of sight.
