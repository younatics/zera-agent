"Washington (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters held hands and encircled the White House grounds on Sunday, demanding President Barack Obama reject a proposed oil pipeline that would stretch between Canada and Texas. ""Stop the pipeline, yes we can!"" the environmental activists chanted about the 1,700-mile Keystone XL project. Until last week, the White House had said final decision on the pipeline would be up to the State Department, following an environmental impact analysis and a public commenting period. But Obama has implied recently that he may step in. Those gathered Sunday afternoon in Washington -- from as far north as Maine, as far south as Florida and as far west as Nebraska, said organizers -- hoped public pressure would persuade the president. ""We need to remind him he is the leader who we elected,"" Courtney Hight, a former member of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and now executive director of the Energy Action Coalition, told the crowd. ""(We need him) to give back some of the hope he gave us three years ago."" She was among several who began speaking around 2 p.m., in addition to U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, actor Mark Ruffalo, Jim Wallis of the progressive Christian group Sojourners and scientist James Hansen. Many people in the crowd wore orange vests that read, ""Stop the pipeline,"" while a few dressed as polar bears. A large model of a black pipeline was held aloft and walked around the White House several times. ""I'm hoping to God that the president, or whatever higher power, will use rational sense and understand that people don't want this,"" Willa Tharnish, a senior and environmental studies major at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, said of the project. Pipeline operator TransCanada says on its website that the $13 billion pipeline ""will play an important role in linking a secure and growing supply of Canadian crude oil with the largest refining markets in the United States, significantly improving North American security supply."" TransCanada says it ""is devoted to minimizing its environmental impact"" in creating and operating Keystone XL. ""In all cases, great care and planning will be taken to minimize and avoid impacts to the environment, including rare or endangered species, habitat, significant water crossings, and historical and paleontological resources,"" the company says. While saying it is ready to respond to any leak or crisis, TransCanada stresses that it believes pipelines ""are safe and the chance of a significant spill is remote."" ""Pipelines are the safest, most reliable, economical and environmentally favorable way to transport oil and petroleum products,"" says the company. Yet environmental activists have decried the project, with the Energy Action Coalition calling it ""potentially catastrophic."" The pipeline would transport toxic crude oil from under Canada's Boreal forest, home to many North American songbirds, to refineries in Texas, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. The process threatens rivers and communities along the way, said the group, which was one of the chief organizers of Sunday's event. Environmentalists additionally are urging the president to block construction in the spirit of his 2008 campaign promise to move the country away from fossil fuels. Hight told CNN that she felt a State Department review of the project is flawed, adding that she feels Obama needs to stand up to ""big oil."" Michael Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director, said from the rally that he felt the activist push against the pipeline is surging. He added that he fully expects Obama to reject the project. Hight said that the arrests of hundreds of activists over the summer ""brought the issue into the radar."" While he hasn't made a decision, the president chimed in about the project in an interview last week with CNN affiliate KETV in Omaha, Nebraska. ""Folks in Nebraska, like folks all across the country, aren't going to say to themselves, 'We're going to take a few thousand jobs if it means our kids are potentially drinking water that would damage their health,'"" Obama said. ""When somebody gets sick, that's a cost that society has to bear as well. So these are all things that you have to take a look at when you make these decisions."" The president said his priority is to ensure residents are not at risk. ""There's a way of doing that and making sure the health and safety of the people of Nebraska are protected,"" he said. ""And that's how I'll be measuring these recommendations when they come to me.""","NEW: Thousands of protesters encircle White House grounds, chanting ""stop the pipeline""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Accompanied by body-armor vested London police officers, Lambeth Senior Trading Standards Officer Ray Bouch walks into a beauty and cosmetics shop on Brixton's Electric Avenue. Confiscated skincare products seized for containing hydroquinone -- banned in the UK. Bouch works for the London borough's Public Protection Unit -- tasked with keeping everything from faulty condoms to illicit vodka off the streets. Today, he's in search of contraband cosmetics: illegal skin bleaching creams British authorities say can be harmful to consumers. Within minutes, he's found almost a dozen bars of soap listing a banned bleaching agent on the box. ""Illegal bleaching creams and soaps are a major problem,"" Bouch says. ""And once we eradicate it from Brixton, it will go to another borough where there's a big Asian or Black population."" Skin bleaching -- using chemical or natural products to lighten skin color -- is common practice in the Americas, Africa, across Asia, and increasingly, in Europe. Psychologists say consumer demand can be traced to perceptions that lighter skinned or white people are more successful, intelligent and sexually desirable. And as the UK's Asian, African and African-Caribbean communities grow, so too -- cosmetics industry experts say -- does ethnic spending power for products promoted to lighten skin tone. But some of these creams, soaps and solutions contain hydroquinone, an ingredient that is banned in cosmetic products sold in the United Kingdom. The United States Food and Drug Administration says based on experiments done on animals, it ""cannot rule out"" hydroquinone's potential cancer risk in humans. Use of the ingredient in over-the-counter cosmetics is restricted, but still legal, in the U.S., South Africa and other countries. And some of these products are making their way to store shelves across the UK. The police officers say they are stationed to keep the peace, as Bouch asks the store manager why the banned products are for sale. She says the bleaching soaps were an oversight: ""The soaps are just something that's come on our shelves without us realizing. To sell this would be stupidity,"" she says. But Bouch believes some shops are continuing to sell illegal skin creams despite the risk of fines because demand for the products is so high. ""The only thing I can say is that it is demand-led. Shop owners are making a great profit from it,"" Bouch says. Cosmetics industry analysts say cosmetics companies are realizing there's money to be made here. They argue minority communities are an underserved market with a long tradition of buying bleaching products -- legal or otherwise. ""Ethnic consumers in the UK account for around one in 10 people,"" says Alexandra Richmond, Senior Health and Beauty Analyst with Mintel Research. ""We've noticed the number of launches of not just skin creams, but soaps and deodorants that contain whitening and bleaching agents."" Dr. Dele Olajide, a leading psychologist at King's College London, blames consumer demand on the media centering on fair skinned blacks like American pop singer Beyonce and British actress Thandie Newton. ""The image that the media presents about black people is that we are inferior, we are not as good as everybody else. But those who are successful and going places are those who are light-skinned people. So one might say that the desire to be like white people underpins people's wanting to be fairer-skinned,"" Olajide says. Recently in the U.S., an African American D.J. was roundly criticized for offering light-skinned women free admission into a Detroit nightclub. So-called ""colorism"" isn't limited to blacks: A commercial seen on Indian satellite channels and on YouTube stars Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan promoting a skin cream called ""Fair & Handsome."" The commercial shows a remarkably glum dark-skinned Indian man who, after using the skin lightening cream, turns many shades whiter. He now walks with confidence -- and with a lovely lady running to his side. Dermatologists say bleaching creams with hydroquinone are safe to reduce the appearance of age spots or smaller blemishes -- if used as directed. Read what dermatologists in America say in defense of hydroquinone. But other skin specialists say abusing products, for example by rubbing the product on the entire face, neck or body can be dangerous over time. ""There is no safe way to bleach your skin beyond your natural color,"" says Sujata Jolly, a research scientist. ""Initially, [the bleaching cream] will appear to lighten the skin,"" she says. ""The reaction between the sun and chemicals triggers an oxidation reaction, which then starts turning the skin darker ... and as the skin gets darker, one uses more cream more vigorously. ""By doing that you start to break the skin, and then the chemicals will then penetrate into the bloodstream and reach your liver and kidneys. And that's where it could cause more damage,"" she says.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Car bombs targeting Shiite pilgrims killed at least 32 people and wounded 154 others south of Baghdad on Friday, an Interior Ministry official said. Police said two bombs blew up in quick succession in Karbala, where the pilgrims had congregated at the shrine of Imam Hussein. The people were marking Arbaeen -- the end of the 40-day mourning period at the close of Ashura. Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D. That event helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. In Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded targeting Shiite pilgrims killed one person and wounded 15 others.","NEW: 154 others wounded in bombings .

"(CNN) -- Think of all of the ridiculous things you've seen on Twitter. Have a good mental image? Hold on to it, because a recent tweet from a presumed fan of rapper J. Cole might top your list. On Tuesday, the same day J. Cole officially released his latest album, ""Born Sinner,"" he retweeted a threat he received from a Twitter user who goes by the name @_TzC_. ""Retweet me and I'll buy 'Born Sinner.' Don't retweet me and I'll kill my lil sister,"" the message said. It was accompanied by a photo of a girl standing with a gun pointed at her head. At the time, J. Cole responded to the tweet, ""wildest s*** i ever seen on twitter bruh."" CNN reached out to J. Cole's camp for further comment, but has yet to hear back. @_TzC_ first posted the statement late Monday night, and since then has tweeted that he's been ""ripped apart"" by other users -- not to mention that the police have gotten involved. ""My mom is so mad at me.... I gotta go into hiding for a lil while,"" he shared, later replying to one inquirer, ""(I)t was a BB gun. Cops came to my house and everything."" In a statement to TMZ, he offered an apology: ""I'd like to apologize to America for the photo and to put J. Cole in that position. It was all a joke. It was an unloaded BB gun and my sister was in on it. I only tweeted it because I didn't expect a response. Mr. Cole please don't sue me. I want to formally apologize more to J. Cole and yeah my mom made me delete my twitter until I fixed it."" Police in New Braunfels, Texas, are investigating the tweet's alleged author. Capt. John McDonald said the BB gun was unloaded and he called the post a lapse in judgment. The Twitter user has been cooperative in visits to the department, he said. There has been no decision on charges, which would be misdemeanors if pursued, McDonald said on Wednesday. The image in question was still visible on Twitter on Wednesday, and the social networking site referred CNN to its media policy, noting that the company doesn't comment on individual accounts ""for privacy and security reasons."" Twitter's media policy states that the company doesn't ""mediate content,"" although ""some content is not permissible by law."" If an uploaded image is reported and is found to be unlawful, the photo would be removed and the individual's account would be suspended. On Wednesday, the Twitter user in question was still posting, as he told his followers: ""I make terrible decisions. Don't admire me. ... I'm not a bad person, I'm just stupid.""

"(CNN) -- A friend once said ""We women must learn to choose our battles."" Women in Saudi Arabia shape their agenda according to where they choose to take on their new challenges, what they prioritize, when they let go, and how they win. The self-evident statement that ""Saudi Arabia should integrate and empower women economically"" defines my battle and that of many other women. Read more: Saudi activists say kingdom trying to silence them . Economic empowerment offers a win-win scenario for Saudi Arabia and its women. It promotes gender equality and helps the country to diversify away from petroleum, a longstanding national goal. Rising numbers of well-educated women enlarge the national talent pool, allowing reduced dependence on expatriates (who comprise over half the workforce). Instead women are still not seen as part of the solution. Since 2001, the number of Saudi women seeking employment has risen faster than the number of jobs, resulting in a 28 percent female unemployment rate, nearly four times that of men, according to The Ministry of Labor in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with Booz & Company analysis. Opinion: Small protests have big impact in Saudi Arabia . Women's economic empowerment also boosts household income. Studies demonstrate that women are more likely than men to use their resources to promote their children's health and education. Economic growth alone is not enough. It needs to be geared instead towards inclusive growth of women. Saudi Arabia is prosperous, with GDP per capita of close to $23,000 in 2012 according to the IMF. However, Saudi Arabia ranked 123 out of 128 countries in Booz & Company's Third Billion Index which measures women's economic participation. In addition to economic growth, Saudi Arabia needs inclusive economic policies that promote long-term, targeted reforms that harness the potential of its aspiring women. Allowing women to drive, for example, is economic empowerment. Many Saudi women are likely to give up their jobs because they cannot afford to hire drivers to get them to work. Read more: America, the Saudi Arabia of tomorrow . Economic measures need to be accompanied by civic changes that make women more visible in leading positions and that allow them to engage in shaping the debate. The decision to appoint women to the Shura Council, the kingdom's national consultative body, will have both these effects. Research shows that visibility is a key dimension of empowerment. It creates national role models and encourages younger women to advance in their careers. In Argentina, for example, women have made progress thanks to their national prominence. They hold high political office and are 39 percent of the parliament, compared to 6 per cent in 1990. Visibility fosters economic integrationâ€”Argentina's women are now 40 percent of the workforce, according to the World Bank. The engagement of women in the policy debate is critical. Women's issues can become more salient in Shura Council discussions. The council's advisory role means it can offer proposals and programs to executive bodies that emphasize women's education, employment and civil, legal and social status. The step forward of putting women on the Shura Council, and King Abdullah's promise that women can vote in the 2015 municipal elections, raises the prospect of women holding ministerial posts (Currently, one woman is the deputy minister of education, unlike many other Arab Gulf countries where women now hold ministerial positions). The struggle for economic empowerment is the right fight for Saudi women and for a country seeking to transform its economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mounira Jamjoom.","The number of Saudi women seeking employment has risen faster than the number of jobs .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two rockets from Gaza slammed into southern Israel on Thursday morning, as U.S. President Barack Obama prepared to leave Jerusalem for Ramallah for meetings with top Palestinian Authority officials. One of the rockets landed in the courtyard of a house in the city of Sderot, but no casualties were reported, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. A police disposal expert was still searching for the other rocket, Rosenfeld said. Obama is on a four-day trip to Israel and the West Bank, his first since assuming office. On Thursday, he is expected to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Israel seized Gaza during the 1967 war, and withdrew settlers from there in 2005. In the ensuing years, militants in Gaza have regularly launched rocket attacks into southern Israel. In November, Israel launched what it called the Pillar of Defense operation, a series of military strikes on Gaza designed to stop the constant rocket fire. Eight days of round-the-clock warfare followed between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian movement that controls Gaza. As Israel targeted Hamas military commanders and weaponry, Palestinian militants continued to fire rockets into Israel, battering the southern region and reaching Israel's two major cities -- Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel called up reservists and massed its forces on the Gaza border, threatening a ground invasion. Many feared a repeat of Israel's Operation Cast Lead offensive against Palestinian militants in late 2008, an operation that led to a bloody three-week war. The fighting in November took its toll: More than 160 Palestinians, many of whom were civilians, were killed. Six Israelis died, including civilians and soldiers. Hundreds were wounded. The fighting ended after Egypt and the United States helped broker the cease-fire that lasted until February 26. On that day, a rocket damaged a road outside the town of Ashkelon, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Gaza. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a Gaza militant group, claimed responsibility . CNN's Michael Schwartz reported from Jerusalem and Karen Smith from Atlanta.","One rocket lands in the courtyard of a house .

"(CNN) -- Spain, a eurozone behemoth, is in the crosshairs of Europe's financial crisis. The country is suffering from soaring borrowing costs, a banking system leaking cash and unemployment rates at devastating levels. Greece might be risking expulsion from the eurozone but Spain's situation is a focus of concern. If such a major economy were to fail, the repercussions could cause unprecedented havoc across Europe -- and the globe. Just how bad is the pain in Spain? On Thursday, Spain will reveal its 2013 budget, which is expected to introduce harsh new austerity measures. Reports have suggested they could match the potential requirements of a full sovereign bailout. According to Michala Marcussen, Societe Generale economist, ""substantial efforts"" will be required to meet a budget deficit target of 4.5%. Pension reforms are possible, such as fast-tracking plans to increase the retirement age to 67 from 65, while taxation and labor markets could also be targeted, Marcussen noted. The budget is followed by Friday's release of the country's banking audit, which is expected to reveal details of the sector's financial needs. Consensus sits at €60 billion and ""too low a number will raise concerns that there are more hidden losses to come -- all the more given the very frail economic backdrop,"" Marcussen wrote in an analysis note. The audit follows an agreement by eurozone finance ministers in June to give aid to Spain, tagging up to €100 billion to shore up its banking sector. At the time, Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said the deal meant ""European credibility won, the future of the euro won [and] Europe won."" The country has been facing credit issues after its financial problems were thrown into sharp relief by the bailout of Bankia, the country's fourth-largest bank. Bankia was forced to call for €19 billion ($23.7 billion) in assistance in May, panicking markets. It sent Spain's cost of borrowing (for the sovereign 10-year bond) toward 7% -- a level which is regarded as unsustainable and has precipitated bailouts of other euro countries. But Spain -- in its second recession since 2009 -- has been dubbed ""too big to bail, too big to fail."" The Spanish economy is the eurozone's fourth-largest -- after Germany, France and Italy -- making up around 11% of the bloc's GDP. To put that in perspective, Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- the three eurozone countries which have already been bailed out -- combined make up less than 6% of the bloc's economy. A request for aid would likely create a backlash in the markets and test the European Central Bank's plan to buy up sovereign bonds on the secondary market. How did Spain reach this point? Spain's banking sector is facing up to years of bad investments, largely in real estate, which was buoyed by cheap credit and the country's sunny climate. Its housing boom-times of 2002 to 2008 were fed, in part, by retired north Europeans buying up second houses in places such as Valencia and Murcia, according to political scientist Julio Embid, of think-tank Fundación Alternativas. Real estate prices have now fallen some 30% to 50% from their highs, leaving Spain's banks, or cajas with housing stock on their books whose current value is much lower than the original. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of houses built during the boom remain unsold, and people wanting to buy may find it difficult to get credit. Embid also points to the cajas' politically-driven executive appointments as a contributing factor to the crisis. ""Many senior bankers were low-profile regional politicians or majors, without any financial experience or bank background,"" he said. What has Spain done to try and sort through this mess? The government set up the FROB (Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring) in 2009, to help reorganize its banking sector, and has received international recognition for its efforts to date. According to April's International Monetary Fund report, the country has reduced the number of financial institutions from 45 to 11. The report noted: ""The authorities are, rightly, focusing on strengthening the banking sector."" It said the authorities were showing ""an appropriate sense of urgency"" but also warned that ""unless the weak institutions are quickly and adequately cleaned up, the sound banks will suffer unnecessarily by a continued loss of market confidence in the banking sector."" As it stands, the banks have an estimated €300 billion of problem loans on their books, with the full cost of recovery not yet clear. What other headaches does Spain face? In addition to the financial sector's problems, Spain could be liable for the debts of several regional governments, which have been hit with ratings downgrades. Spain also has an unemployment crisis, with more than half those under 24 out of work, and almost one in four people overall. Spain's jobless rate has helped pushed the eurozone's total unemployment rate to 11% -- its highest since the eurozone was created in 1999. Why is the economy collapsing now? The situation in Spain has developed like a perfect storm, with money being pulled out of the country, despite the desperate need to stem capital flight and support its banking system. This leaves Spain in a precarious financial state, driving investors away, pushing up its borrowing costs and making it more likely to need a bailout. It's a reminder of how governments are inextricably tied to their country's banking systems, essentially the lifeblood of their economy. In Ireland, the banking sector's similar gorge on property forced the country to take a €67.5 billion bailout in 2010. The mood of the markets may, ultimately, dictate Spain's ability to pull itself from its financial hole. Investors already twitchy about the prospect of a ""Grexit"" -- a Greek exit from the euro -- will react badly to further bad news out of Spain. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's has put the chance of Greece exiting the euro at around one in three, but says the impact of such an outcome on other countries is not yet clear. The struggles in Europe have been exacerbated by continued miserable news out of the U.S. Where does Madrid stand when it comes to making cuts to public services? Spain's emergence as the crisis epicenter has again fed debate over the value of austerity over stimulus. Greece, the first euro country to take a bailout, has been swallowing austerity medicine since 2010. But its economy has slid further into recession, and initial hopes it could detach itself from external life-lines within two years now look wildly optimistic. Spain has also been implementing austerity measures to try and combat its crisis. Rajoy, who won a landslide victory over the Socialist Party in November 2011, focused on cost cutting and labor reforms. But, as with other fragile countries within the euro bloc, Spain's economy remains weak and its unemployment levels continue to rise. Some European leaders are now voicing concerns against austerity measures and in the U.S., the Federal Reserve has moved towards more stimulus, with further quantitative easing. CNNMoney's Aaron Smith, Alfred Souza and Ben Rooney, and CNN's Al Goodman and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","Spain, a eurozone behemoth, is in the crosshairs of Europe's financial crisis .

"(CNN) -- A Syrian airstrike in Aleppo has killed at least 15 people, including nine children, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday. A single bomb landed in the mostly Kurdish district of Sheikh Maksoud, the group said. Kurdish activists say the number of dead is expected to rise because there are many injured and in critical condition. Amateur video purporting to show the site of the bombing appeared on the Internet shortly after the attack, providing a glimpse of a panicked scene. Fires burned in a building and in a destroyed vehicle, the video showed. People shouted as they ran from victim to victim; some who were not moving. Bystanders began to pick up the unmoving bodies and place them in the back of a pick-up truck, the video shows. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video. Syrian forces have been clashing for several days with Kurdish militias on the outskirts of the district, the Syrian Observatory said. Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said 116 people were killed across the country Saturday, including 37 in Aleppo. CNN cannot independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria. The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom. That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed president by Syria's parliament in 2000 after his father died. The government responded with a brutal crackdown. In February, the United Nations estimated that 70,000 people had been killed in the fighting.","An opposition group says the Syrian government dropped a bomb in Aleppo .

"(Time.com) -- Never before have so many people all of a sudden thought, ""I wonder if Kansas City is a nice place to live?"" That's because Google recently announced the details behind Google Fiber, its incredibly fast new Internet service that'll cost eligible Kansas City residents $70 per month. Another $50 will add a cable TV package to the mix as well. All in all, $120 is in line with what you'd expect to pay for similar TV-plus-Internet service from other major cable providers. So why would someone in Kansas City want to make the switch? The need for speed . Google is promising download and upload speeds of up to one gigabit per second, which it says is about 100 times faster than the average U.S. broadband connection. Remember back in June when Verizon announced its FiOS Quantum package, which offered theoretical download speeds of 300 megabits per second and theoretical upload speeds of 65 megabits per second? That package costs $210 per month. Google's theoretical download speed is more than three times as fast and its theoretical upload speed is more than 15 times as fast for a third of the price. If Google Fiber ever gets out of Kansas City, other Internet providers better watch out. Best. Remote. Ever. If you sign up for both Internet and cable for two years, you'll get the coolest remote control ever made: Google's new Nexus 7 tablet. Normally selling for $200, it's arguably the best non-iPad tablet on the market, equipped with an app that lets you control your TV and search for shows with a swipe of your finger. Not only that, you'll be able to watch TV on your tablet from any room in the house. Time.com: Equiso's Android-on-a-stick turns TVs into Smart TVs for $70 . The app will also be available for certain Android and iOS devices, letting you use your smartphone as a remote control as well. Ultimate DVR . The standard DVRs from most cable providers do a decent job, but Google has an added bonus for its customers: Its storage box can record up to eight TV shows at one time and features two terabytes of storage. That's a lot of episodes of Real Housewives of New Jersey (500 hours worth, to be exact). Plus, if you ever get bored with what you've recorded, you can stream Netflix or YouTube from the DVR. Searching for stuff to watch on TV will include relevant streamable results, too, all in the same place. Who needs hardware? Google is offering one terabyte of Google Drive storage for Internet subscribers and is heavily pushing its Chromebook for $299. This, my friends, is what this whole Google Fiber thing is all about. As long as people have slow Internet connections, relying solely on Google's cloud isn't really an option. Time.com: Why Google or Facebook buying your favorite startup means it's probably toast . But if you have a one-gigabit-per-second connection? All of a sudden using a Chromebook with Google Drive as your primary computer doesn't sound so crazy. Free Internet . Even if you don't want blazing download speeds and a cool tablet for a remote control, you can still get Google Fiber's basic five-megabit service for $0 per month. Time.com: Google adds new 34-button scientific calculator to search results . Granted, you'll need to put down a $300 construction free, but after that your Internet connection will be guaranteed free for the next seven years.

"(CNN) -- Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has made a rare ""surprise"" visit to an educational center in the capital, Damascus, in an apparent effort to show that it is ""business as usual"" for the regime, despite the country's brutal civil war. A video posted on YouTube by al-Assad's office shows him driving up to the building in the al-Tijara neighborhood -- at the wheel of his own car -- on Wednesday and walking inside, alone, watched by families from balconies and apartments nearby. The film then shows the president, wearing a dark suit and tie, smiling as he is greeted with applause, before talking to those who have gathered to meet him. He is seen hugging one woman, shaking hands with a man, and putting his hand on the shoulder of a young woman wearing a pink headscarf. Middle East expert Christopher Phillips, of think tank Chatham House, said the video and reports of the meeting chime with efforts to portray al-Assad as an approachable man of the people. He said the visit was part of efforts to convince those inside and outside the country that life is carrying on as normal in Syria. The regime has continued to pass laws and hold elections in spite of the deadly conflict tearing the country apart. Read more: Al-Assad, defined by violence . ""The pretense is a vital part of the strategy,"" he told CNN. ""The regime still believes it will win the war; to do that it is important that al-Assad is not seen as a deranged, butchering madman, but as a normal person. ""They believe that they can survive isolation, that they can defeat what they call the 'insurgency' and that, after a time, they will be reintegrated into the international fold... but they have to maintain that pretense."" Up to 70,000 Syrians are believed to have died in the Syrian conflict since March 2011, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in February. What began amid the turmoil of the Arab Spring as an uprising against Bashar al-Assad has spiraled into a bitter civil war which now threatens to destabilize the Middle East. More than a million refugees have fled the fighting, crossing the border and flooding into overloaded camps in neighboring Turkey and Jordan. Read more: Profile: Asma al-Assad . Syria's official SANA news agency reported that the president and his wife Asma later met the families of teachers and students ""martyred due to terrorist attacks"" to offer them support. SANA quoted al-Assad as saying: ""Today Syria as a whole is wounded... there is no one that didn't lose one of his or her relatives, a brother, father or a mother,"" before insisting that the country is involved in ""a battle of will and steadfastness,"" calling on the audience to remain strong to protect others. It was the second public outing for the normally camera-shy al-Assad family in less than a week, after months out of the limelight: Asma al-Assad was spotted at a ""Mother's Rally"" at the Damascus Opera House last weekend, scotching rumors she had fled the country for Russia, the UK or Jordan. Philips said the reappearance of Syria's glamorous Sunni first lady was highly significant, with the civil war becoming increasingly sectarian in recent months. ""In marrying Asma -- a non-veiled, secular Sunni -- Bashar al-Assad, who is Alawite, crossed the sectarian divide, and their relationship helped create an image of Syria as an integrationist, non-sectarian society,"" he explained. ""Making sure she is seen in public, showing that she is still with him, supporting him is very important... it is part of the show of defiance, of them saying 'We're still here, and we're still doing things our way.'""

"(Mashable) -- In peeking ahead to predict what 2012 holds for Google, it's informative to look back at the eventful year it had. While one can't help but see the big product introductions -- a social network, a mobile-payment system, a music store -- it's the deletions that are much more interesting. Google got rid of a host of unwieldy and barely used products and features in 2011. While Google regularly does ""spring cleaning"" to trim its vast portfolio, the projects scrapped this year were many, and most were originally intended to be major focuses of the company. Just look at this partial list of the services killed or folded into larger projects: Buzz. Knol. Checkout. PowerMeter. Health. Wave. Even the company's well-meaning initiative to save the world from coal-fired power plants got tossed. The mass culling is indicative of the style of Google's new CEO, Larry Page. Of course, Page was Google's first CEO, too, stepping aside for a decade to let Eric Schmidt run the show while Page and fellow company co-founder Sergey Brin could craft the company's web services. Google experimented a lot during that decade, and now that Page is back in the driver's seat, he appears to have gotten that out of his system. Page is leading Google with unprecedented focus. From the major moves the company has made in the nine short months since Page got the top job, it's clearer than ever which technologies Google is really serious about. After all, the ones it's more lukewarm toward have probably gotten the ax. Being serious isn't the same as success, of course, but it's an essential first step. Google may be aggressively plowing ahead in the areas of social networking, mobile payments and mobile devices, but so are many other heavy hitters. There are sure to be some collisions in 2012. Let's take a look at some key ones. Google+ comes into its own . Probably the most head-turning Google product launch in 2011 was the debut of Google+. Google's very own social network borrows elements from Twitter and Facebook, but is its own animal. The launch saw virtually instant adoption by pretty much anyone and everyone who considered themselves tech- or media-savvy. And that's been its greatest weakness. Google+ has had favorable growth and many positive reviews, but it's still relatively unknown among ""real"" people. And those that do know it have the distinct impression that it's the social network for hard-core nerds. That's something Google has to change if it wants people to use its service instead of competitors, and going mainstream has to be a primary goal in the new year. It can do so by leveraging its differentiators (like the useful multiple-person videoconferencing Hangouts), but most of all it has to find its voice -- its one-sentence description that doesn't have the words ""like Facebook"" in it. This task is largely up to its users, since they're the ones using the service, deciding which features they like and how they use it. They're already starting to, with many Plusers treating the site like a centralized, supercharged blogging service. Even as Google+ grows, though, it's doubtful that it'll ever be able to rise as high as Facebook, which is expected to hit a cool billion users this year. But as long as the service starts to become known as ""the place where you..."" something, maybe Barney Stinson, the digital-savvy womanizer on ""How I Met Your Mother"" will be regularly referencing it by the end of 2012. Android puts its house in order . The most sticking criticism of Android is its fragmentation problem -- that there are so many devices running it, often with completely different specs, that it's impossible to know with any certainty whether or not your device will ever get any updates that Google releases. That may not have hurt the platform's market share, but it's no doubt given a good chunk of potential customers pause. Google's acquisition of Motorola is a big step toward, if not putting this fragmentation business to rest, at least turning the tide a little. You can bet the farm that every Motorola device released under the new Google regime will have a clear upgrade path. Although Google's other partners are wary of potential favoritism to Motorola, this actually works in Google's favor, too, since now they'll be strongly motivated to get in line with Google's plans, lest customers opt for the perceived reliability of the Moto/Google name. At the same time, the recent Android malware scares have given the platform a black eye. While Google has been very effective at addressing viruses and trojans in various evildoing apps as they've appeared, it needs to deploy a more proactive strategy to attack the issue head-on. Could an acquisition of, say, mobile-security company Lookout be next? It couldn't hurt. Ceding tablet territory while building content . It's something of a embarrassment to Google that the most popular Android tablet ever launched is the Amazon Kindle Fire, which doesn't even run Google's tablet-optimized operating system. Amazon, by creating highly customized software that runs on top of Android and points users to the company's digital services, essentially carved out its own platform by hijacking Google's. Since Android is an open system, there's not much Google can do about it. At this point, it doesn't really want to just yet. Tablets so far are essentially media-consumption devices -- good for watching TV and movies, reading books and playing games. As colossal as the company is in many areas (see below), right now Google is far from a big player in offering actual content. Google Books and Google TV are anemic services, if not outright flops. Google Music, though promising, is brand new and has no mind share. So it makes sense that consumers reacted to ""proper"" Android tablets with disdain. After all, Google never opened up version 3.0 ""Honeycomb,"" so anyone with actual content to offer (i.e. Amazon and Barnes & Noble) had no interest in using it. The devices on offer were virtually identical overpriced touchscreens whose only noteworthy commonality was that they weren't iPads. Even though Google's just gotten into the hardware business by purchasing Motorola, I can't see it focusing much on tablets just yet. Sure, the successors to the Xoom are on their way, and they'll even move into the hands of a few customers, but Google must first focus on bumping up the quality and reputation of its content offerings before any ""Xoom Nexus"" has a shot at gobbling up market share from Apple and Amazon. Original videos on YouTube is great first step -- there will be many more in 2012. GDrive cements domination of the cloud . This is kind of a no-brainer, but Google will continue its blot-out-the-sun dominance in its primary services: search, email and cloud services in general. Bing, the only credible challenger to Google's search business, is rising, but very slowly, and that's with Microsoft shoveling mountains of money into the service. And even though Yahoo and Hotmail now offer much better services than they did a couple of years ago, Gmail still has the (deserved) reputation of being the best and coolest of the lot. Google's been the cloud business for a long time, of course, but when it finally unveils its expected Dropbox competitor, nicknamed GDrive, it's hard to see it not becoming an instant hit. Google is already synonymous with storing stuff online, and with Google+ it's showed it can deftly merge disparate services to create a new and seamless experience. Standing against Google's huge storage capabilities and cloud expertise could be too much for any other player in the space. Overall: Going with what works . Larry Page appears to have instilled Google with a new sense of focus, quickly striking while the iron's hot on promising products like Google+ and Android, putting stagnant ones like Buzz out of their misery, and nurturing potential late-starters like Google Wallet. Some games, after all, are long, and we won't know for a while whether the company's bets on technologies such as mobile payments or solar panels will ever pay off. As soon as Page sees a winner, though, he clearly knows how to put the overwhelming force of the entire Google empire behind it. Before 2012 is out, he'll no doubt have done it several times.

"(CNN) -- If this yacht could talk, one can only imagine the stories it would tell about one of the most high-profile romances of the 20th century. The stately superyacht Christina O isn't just a gorgeous 99-meter vessel. It's the palatial setting where billionaire shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis married Jackie Kennedy, the former wife of U.S. President John F Kennedy. Now the luxury liner which played host to the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of 1950s high society -- including Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and John Wayne -- has gone on sale for a whopping $32 million. Known for its lavish parties, the elegant ship may well be called the ""Love Boat,"" for its notorious on board romances -- and even a royal wedding. In 1956 Prince Rainier of Monaco and U.S. screen siren Grace Kelly held their wedding reception on the boat, which accommodates 36 guests in 18 sumptuous staterooms. Onassis' own love affair with opera singer Maria Callas also played out on board, as they cruised exotic locations across Europe in the company of Hollywood stars Greta Garbo, Bette Davis and Margot Fonteyne. However, the affair ended abruptly when the tycoon courted President Kennedy's widow, Jackie, later marrying on the very same yacht in 1968, near his private island of Scorpios. ""Aristotle Onassis saw Christina O as a powerful symbol of his growing business empire,"" said Nicholas Edmiston, chairman of the yacht company Edmiston, which plans to sell the vessel mid-August. ""It really was the last word in opulence and many personalities were attracted by its ability to offer them some privacy, not just by its magnificence."" It's been quite a journey for the boat which began life in 1943 as a World War II surplus Canadian frigate. A decade later, Onassis bought the boat for just $34,000, gutting the interior and spending $4 million -- the equivalent of $45 million today -- converting her into one of the luxurious superyachts in the world. In 1975, Onassis died and the yacht was left to his daughter, Christina, in his will. She in turn bequeathed it to the Greek government as a presidential yacht. More than 20 years later, the tired-looking vessel was restored to its former glory, and now boasts an art deco dining room where Maria Callas and Frank Sinatra used to perform, an atrium with onyx pillars, and a mosaic pool which converts into a dance floor.","Christina O, former superyacht of Aristotle Onassis, up for sale .

"New York (CNN) -- Family heirlooms are often packed away for safe keeping. For one man from China, hiding a 26-carat black diamond worth $14.5 million was not in his plans. A businessman from Hong Kong commissioned craftsman Stuart Hughes of Liverpool to help him show off his family treasure. The result? An iPhone 5 boasted by Hughes to be ""the world's most expensive phone,"" valued at $15 million. According to Hughes' website, this iPhone includes 600 flawless white diamonds, a full solid gold dressing and 53 diamonds on the rear that make up the iconic Apple logo. However, the reason this particular iPhone is so valuable is on the face of the phone. The Chinese businessman, identified only as ""Joe,"" contacted Hughes and asked to have a rare, black diamond incorporated into the iPhone. ""It's not often that people get to deal with a very, very rare diamond,"" Hughes said. Hughes said he was contacted 18 months ago by Joe, who expressed interest in his gold chassis iPhone handsets. Joe then told Hughes about the black diamond that had been in his family for generations. Hughes spent nine weeks creating the solid gold chassis of an iPhone 5 and then placed the black diamond as the home button. The appraisal Joe had done on the black diamond put its value at approximately $14.5 million, according to Hughes, who said he saw the certificate of authenticity. Hughes told CNN that one of the solid gold handsets with the diamonds that he crafts is worth approximately $153,000. ""We had a tech guy in Macau who was able to set the stone, which to this day has never left China,"" Hughes said. Hughes set a record in 2011 for crafting an iPhone 4S with 500 individual diamonds, totaling more than 100 carats. That phone was estimated to be valued at $9 million. The 42-year-old craftsman is known for making lavish and expensive items, including an iPad made of solid gold he debuted two years ago. ""I am a craftsman,"" Hughes said. ""I basically fulfill and make up these ideas."" Throughout the years and his many projects, Hughes said this particular handset is right up near the top of the most lavish projects he's completed.","The ""iPhone 5 Black Diamond"" is estimated to be worth $15 million .

"(CNN) -- I don't like feeling stuck in a particular operating system, social network or piece of software. It's not that I won't commit to a product or company -- it's that I don't trust any of them enough to get married to one of them. Once they own me, they'll start either selling my data to other companies, limiting my Web experiences to the ones that help sell their clients' products or otherwise screwing with me as a consumer and person. And while I have little faith that consumer protection or privacy advocates can protect my interests against the corporate behemoths, I am beginning to take heart in the way the battles between corporations over their rights to compete have the perhaps unintended side effect of keeping me from having to commit to any one of them. Today, it's Google in the cross hairs. Egged on in part by those left lying in the wake of Google's rise to Web search dominance, the European Commission and U.S. Federal Trade Commission are challenging the company's monopoly and how they are leveraging it. If the story feels familiar, that's because it is. Fourteen years ago, it was Microsoft getting slapped for anticompetitive behavior. The company's dominance in the operating system market appeared so great, so irreversible, that it was deemed a monopoly. For Bill Gates to bundle the Explorer browser along with his operating system -- and to do so in such a way that leveraged this advantage and quashed competition -- was judged illegal and prohibited. Now it's Google's turn for scrutiny. This time, alarm bells first went off when people began to realize that all that photography Google had been doing for its Street View maps services wasn't just photography. As long as Google was driving through neighborhoods taking video of every store and house, it might as well do some WiFi monitoring and see who was online. The Germans, in particular, got irked by this move, but then so did everyone else. This opened the door to bigger charges though -- most significantly that Google's search algorithms are rigged to promote Google's own services while putting those of competitors lower in the list of results. If Google indeed has a monopoly on search -- about 70% of the U.S. market and almost 95% of Europe's -- then it does have a duty to watch out for the players in other markets where Google is competing. That's why, at least as far as pure search terms and equivalent but ranked results, Google's critics may have a point. If a Google company or partner gets higher on the list simply because it's good for Google, then there's a bit of explaining to do. But what about when search results contain more than simple lists, but come to include little built-in utilities? For instance, if you're doing a search for ""plane tickets from NY to LA,"" your list of results will begin with a handy Google flight finding application, built right into the page, complete with space for your desired dates of travel and a submit button. Below that, you get regular old links to Expedia and Kayak and all the other online travel agencies. These are not equivalent results. The Google flight utility isn't just a text link but an interactive tool that imitates the very functionality of Expedia or Kayak. (Once you pick your flights, it sends you to the relevant airline site with all your data already filled in.) In one sense, Google has made its users' lives easier by pulling travel functionality right into its search engine. In another sense, though, Google has replicated the functionality of the online travel agencies and then used its search monopoly to give itself an advantage. For, at least in theory, all the other online ticketing services could be building their own mini-apps to sit right alongside Google's. But they're not really being invited to do so, and if they did, would they be surrendering even more to Google? If an antitrust suit pushed Google to give other companies the same abilities that Google has, we could end up on a path to more functionality for everyone. If it simply forces Google to yank all kinds of utility from the search engine -- or to crowd a formerly streamlined lists of links with a convoluted mix of links, windows, apps and utilities, then the search itself may become a thing of the past. Like a gopher menu. (A what? Exactly.) Technological evolution occurs in fits and starts, and sometimes cutting back growth really just helps the rest of the tree grow fuller and healthier. When Apple can patent the very gestures we use to access data or move windows on a cell phone, or Facebook can become the default phonebook for the world, it puts their individual dominions as companies directly at odds with our ability to control what is shared about us, what Internet we get to see and our awareness of either one. This attack on Google from above ends up protecting some of our interests here down below. In the logic of corporate capitalism, the best safeguard against getting trapped in single-provider solutions from Facebook to the iPhone is when someone can prove it's bad for business. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff : European Commission, FTC challenging Google over monopoly .

"(CNN) -- Google search is about to get way more personal. In a change that's been called the ""most radical transformation ever"" to Google's search engine, the Mountain View, California, company on Tuesday announced an update called ""Search, plus Your World,"" which causes Google's robots to incorporate data from its social network as well as the public Internet when delivering search results to people. ""Search is pretty amazing at finding that one needle in a haystack of billions of Web pages, images, videos, news and much more,"" Google said in a blog post on Tuesday morning. ""But clearly, that isn't enough. You should also be able to find your own stuff on the Web, the people you know and things they've shared with you, as well as the people you don't know but might want to ... all from one search box."" The company added: ""Search is simply better with your world in it."" On the prominent blog Search Engine Land, Danny Sullivan writes that the updates fundamentally change the way Google's search engine functions, calling it the ""most radical"" change ever. ""The new system will perhaps make life much easier for some people, allowing them to find both privately shared content from friends and family plus material from across the Web through a single search, rather than having to search twice using two different systems,"" he writes. ""However, Search Plus Your World may cause some privacy worries, as private content may appear as if it is exposed publicly (it is not). It might also cause concern by making private content more visible to friends and family than those sharing may have initially intended."" On the blog Tech Crunch, Jason Kincaid gives an example search to help explain the changes. Say you were to Google ""Harry Potter,"" he writes. ""For most people, this would probably pull up links to the books, the films, and a variety of fan sites. For this intrepid reporter, though, the results would also include my Picasa album shot at a Harry Potter premiere a few years back (and labeled as such). These images would pop up both in the main search results page, and in Google Images results. Likewise, any blog posts my friends had shared on Google+ about the boy wizard would show up in my results, too."" It's worth noting that Google users who don't like these new personal results can turn them off. A toggle switch that controls personal results should appear in the upper right corner of a search results page, the company says. Click ""no personal results"" to avoid seeing the social content. The social search results started rolling out on Tuesday but may not be visible to all users. Google says the social search applies, for now, only to people who are signed in to Google.com and are searching in English. The update causes Google to surface material that is specifically related to the person who is searching. So my search results won't be the same as yours, if I'm signed in to Google. Things my friends have posted on Google+ and Picasa will show up in the results as well, as long as they have entered caption info about their photos. Google+ profile and topic pages also will get better play in search results after the change. Miguel Helft, a senior writer at Fortune, which is a CNN.com partner website, says the change has the bonus effect for Google of giving lots and lots of exposure to its social network, Google+, which is aimed to be a direct competitor to Facebook. ""The change will expose Google+ profiles, as well as posts and photographs uploaded to the network, to hundreds of millions of search users whether or not they have Google+ accounts. In many cases, the changes will push content from other sites, including Facebook, further down on the search results pages,"" he writes on Fortune.com. Helft adds that social search has long been a ""holy grail"" in tech. ""Facebook has been working with Microsoft to allow that company's search engine, Bing, to surface more personalized content,"" he writes. ""And the Facebook platform has allowed countless services, like Yelp, Pandora and Spotify, to become more personal by showing users content that is relevant to their Facebook friends."" But the change is also likely to upset competitors who complain that Google gives preferential treatment to content from its own products -- from Google+ to YouTube, he writes.","Google adds social, personal content to its search results .

"Washington (CNN) -- Aviation authorities around the world ordered airlines to stop flying their Boeing 787 Dreamliners over fire risk associated with battery failures aboard the highly touted aircraft. Groundings that extended globally on Thursday stemmed from a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration directive on Wednesday night that planes should not fly until the problems are resolved. The action resulted from recent mechanical and other glitches culminating with a severe battery related fire aboard an empty Dreamliner in Boston 10 days ago and an emergency landing in Japan this week prompted by an alarm indicating smoke in an electrical compartment. ""The battery failures resulted in release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage, and smoke on two Model 787 airplanes,"" the FAA said in a statement. ""The root cause of these failures is currently under investigation. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures, and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment,"" the FAA said. In all, authorities in Europe, Japan and India have grounded the planes while the battery problem is investigated. Carriers in Chile and Ethiopia also set down their 787s until further notice. United Airlines is the only U.S. carrier to operate the Dreamliner. The carrier said it would work with the FAA on its directive. It inspected its fleet of six 787s after the Boston fire. The marquee and technologically advanced 787 is widely viewed as crucial to the future of the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer. The Dreamliner order book is very strong even though the plane had years of embarrassing setbacks and cost overruns during development. The first commercial Dreamliner flight took off in October 2011, flying from Tokyo to Hong Kong, and the planes flew without major problems for months. But Boeing's most recent problems with the plane extended beyond battery technology, global safety regulators, canceled service and a steady stream of negative publicity. The company's shares on Wall Street are sharply lower as well. Growing list of problems . Most problems have been considered fixable and described as growing pains for a new airliner. But these experts say any battery system design problem would raise larger issues for the manufacturer, carriers and travelers. Dreamliners fly 150 flights daily worldwide, Boeing said. Q&A: Dreamliner problems explained . Since July, the growing list of reported troubles aboard the planes include a fuel leak, an oil leak, two cracked engines, a damaged cockpit window and a battery problem. The FAA announced a safety review of the aircraft last week before taking stricter action on Wednesday. In the most serious incident so far, an All Nippon Airlines (ANA) 787 with 129 people aboard made an emergency landing after a battery alarm on Wednesday. Those aboard reported a burning smell in the cabin, and an alarm indicated smoke in a forward electrical compartment. Hours later, ANA and Japan Airlines announced that they were grounding their Dreamliners -- a total of 24 planes -- pending an investigation. Japanese authorities followed suit, saying the planes should stay on the ground until battery safety could be assured. The head of India's civil aviation regulator, Arun Mishra, also asked Air India to halt operation of its six Dreamliners for the time being. The European Aviation Safety Agency said it, too, had adopted the FAA directive, which applies to the two 787s flown by the Polish carrier LOT. Ethiopian Airlines also announced it was temporarily grounding four Dreamliners, according to regional manager Yohannes Teklu. It has had no issues with its 787s but is following the FAA directive as ""an extra precautionary safety measure and in line with its commitment of putting safety above all else,"" the company later said in a statement. Chile-based LAN Airlines said it was temporarily grounding its three Boeing 787 aircraft and Qatar Airways was also putting down its fleet of five Dreamliners. Boeing confident planes are safe . Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said in a statement on Wednesday the manufacturing giant is confident that the planes are safe and is working with authorities to get them flying again. ""Boeing is committed to supporting the FAA and finding answers as quickly as possible,"" the statement said. McNerney did not mention specifics about the recent incidents, but said the company ""deeply regrets the impact that recent events have had on the operating schedules of our customers and the inconvenience to them and their passengers."" The batteries are critical to the plane because the 787 is thirsty for electrical power. The Dreamliner uses electricity to run more systems than any other Boeing airliner, said University of Dayton professor Raul Ordonez, an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing Dreamliner development at Boeing's Seattle headquarters. The 787 is unique because its batteries are lithium-ion batteries. These hold more energy for longer periods than the standard nickel cadmium airliner batteries. ""These kinds of batteries,"" Ordonez says, ""are slightly more likely to cause problems."" Although lithium batteries heat up quickly because of their structure, they have systems and circuits in place to prevent overheating, said Tsutomu Nishijima, a spokesman for GS Yuasa. The Japanese company supplies batteries for Dreamliners. Investigation expected to take weeks . The investigation will take several weeks, the company said. Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners so far and has more than 800 additional orders from airlines around the world. Carriers who have ordered planes but are still awaiting delivery, like Qantas of Australia and Etihad in the United Arab Emirates, expressed confidence that the problems would be sorted out by the time they received the planes. Boeing's shares, which had previously been resilient in the face of this month's negative publicity over the Dreamliner, sank another 2% on Thursday. After last week's incident in Boston, Boeing chief engineer Mike Sinnett expressed confidence in the aircraft's battery system. ""I am 100% convinced the airplane is safe to fly,"" he said. ""I fly on it all the time."" Longtime commercial pilot and industry analyst Patrick Smith said the battery issue did not appear to be a major problem, but called the FAA order ""a positive and pro-active step."" ""I don't think that it was dangerous for the plane to be flying, but it probably wasn't the best thing to be flying it on the heels of this latest emergency landing in Japan,"" Smith said. ""All airplanes have their teething problems, and this was trending in a bad direction,"" he added. ""Now the authorities have said, 'Stop,' and that's a good thing."" CNN's Mike M. Ahlers, Thom Patterson, Harmeet Shah Singh, Pamela Boykoff, Junko Ogura, Marilia Brocchetto and Ayesha Durgahee contributed to this report. CNNMoney's Charles Riley and journalist Chie Kobayashi also contributed to this report.","Governments, airlines ground their Dreamliners over fire risk .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush warned Friday the United States is in ""more danger of attack"" because Congress failed to extend legislation on domestic wiretapping laws allowing the government without a warrant to listen in on phone calls and intercept e-mails by foreign terrorist suspects that are transmitted through this country. President Bush said he will not accept another temporary extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Bush's remarks came at the end of a meeting with Republican congressional leaders and Vice President Dick Cheney. ""American citizens must understand, clearly understand, that there still is a threat on the homeland,"" Bush said. ""There's still an enemy which would like to do us harm, and that we've got to give our professionals the tools they need to be able to figure out what the enemy is up to so we can stop it."" Temporary revisions to the 1978 law that regulates wiretapping are set to expire this weekend. Democrats said the law as existed before a temporary revision in August will remain in effect and gives the administration all the authority it needs to spy on suspected terrorists. ""He knows that the underlying 'intelligence' law and the power given to him in the Protect America Act give him sufficient authority to do all of the surveillance and collecting that he needs to do in order to protect the American people,"" House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday. The House of Representatives and Senate are split over whether to include retroactive legal protection for telecommunications companies in a permanent overhaul.  Watch Bush's comments on the FISA controversy » . After Friday's meeting, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, defended Republicans' desire to give the telecommunication companies immunity. ""This issue of the carriers that work with our government are increasingly concerned about their liability and increasingly concerned about whether they are going to continue to work with our intelligence officials,"" Boehner said. Congress is in recess for a week starting Friday. Bush had offered to put off the start of his planned trip to Africa ""if it will help them complete their work on this critical bill,"" but White House spokeswoman Dana Perino later said the president would leave as scheduled Friday. ""The Democrats have made a decision that their higher priority -- over national security -- is taking another recess,"" Perino said. The current laws are set to expire at midnight Saturday. The nation's intelligence agencies then will have to go to court for warrants to listen in on conversations between suspected terrorists overseas. Intelligence officials said that it will cause unnecessary delays, but the government will be able to get permission to conduct eavesdropping through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Even without court permission, agents also can listen in on a suspect's calls without a warrant as long as an application is submitted within three days. Additionally, any warrants already approved are good for a year from when the initial warrant was issued.

"(CNN) -- At first glance, the death of Trayvon Martin seemed to be a straightforward example of ugly, racial conflict resulting in the killing of an innocent black teenager by a white man, George Zimmerman. But now, as evidence continues to come forward, the facts seem much more complicated and the ""obvious truth"" premature. At first, it was thought that Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, was the aggressor because he followed Martin, got into a physical scuffle with him and shot him. But then, some witnesses claim that Martin attacked Zimmerman first, and the initial police report said that Zimmerman had blood on his nose and the back of his head after the incident. However, surveillance video footage that surfaced from the police station is leading to questions about the extent of Zimmerman's injuries. To make matters more complex, we found out that in the past several months, Martin was suspended from school three times, once for the possession of drug paraphernalia. The Miami Herald reported that in the gated community in which Zimmerman patrolled, there were eight burglaries, nine thefts and one shooting in the past year. Neighbors of Zimmerman described him as being passionate about security and credit him with thwarting and cracking some crimes. It was also revealed that Zimmerman identified himself as a Hispanic and was a registered Democrat. The facts are confounding and inconclusive. But the tendency in the first days by some, including Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and an angry chorus of followers, was to rush to judgment with little regard for fairness, due process, or respect for the terrible death of a young man. A mob mentality seems to be in the ascendancy. The New Black Panther Party offered a bounty for Zimmerman's capture. Jackson said that Martin's death shows how ""blacks are under attack"" and ""targeting, arresting, convicting blacks and ultimately killing us is big business."" Apart from the obvious incendiary nature of such comments, what in heaven's name could Jackson mean? Spike Lee fueled the flames by tweeting Zimmerman's home address, which turned out to be the wrong address and resulted in an older couple fleeing from their home and fearing for their lives after threats and crowds outside their residence. Lee, realizing his folly, has since apologized to the couple. These actions and words illustrate a problem in dealing with Martin's death: Many people are not on an impartial hunt for justice but are exploiting this crisis for personal or political gain and claiming that it is representative of larger societal problems. MSNBC political analyst and Democratic fundraiser Karen Finney blamed Martin's death on Republicans. She said, ""[Republican politicians] reinforce and validate old stereotypes that associate the poor and welfare as criminal behavior with African-Americans and people of color, calling us lazy, undeserving recipients of public assistance. In the case of Trayvon, those festering stereotypes had lethal consequences."" Martin's own mother, Sybrina Fulton, filed applications for trademarks on two of the popular phrases used at rallies for Martin, ""I Am Trayvon"" and ""Justice for Trayvon."" Democrats politicized the event with a hearing on Capitol Hill in which Martin's parents testified. Later, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, wore a hoodie on the House floor. It's clear that some of the people raising the most noise are trying to make this less about the horrible death of a young man and more about claims of racial resentment that may or may not exist. The loudest voices should be particularly careful not to rush to conclusions. Remember the Duke lacrosse case, in which members of the team were accused of a gang rape. The public rushed to judgment long before the young men were eventually acquitted. Zimmerman may or may not be guilty; there may or may not be racial motivations. We do not know yet. In the absence of complete evidence, inflammatory comments and belligerent reactions will not aid the search for justice. An angry crowd should not be in charge. Lastly, why is there so much selective outrage on the part of so many? The leading cause of death for black male teenagers is homicide, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Of all the black homicide victims, about 93% are killed by other black people. In 2011, nearly 85% of all people murdered in Philadelphia were black. Where are the marches and protests for these victims? Is it justice people seek or are they looking and even hoping for signs of white racism so they can exploit it? In his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, ""Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust."" While we wait and respect due process of law, we should do our part to uplift human personality. We can do so by giving both Martin and Zimmerman a just weighing of the evidence, both in the court of law and public opinion. Let us not assume the worst of anybody but be guided by the facts.

"Washington (CNN) -- Pain from forced spending cuts is a week away and lawmakers are preparing their aides for the fallout that could hit them like other government workers. ""We've actually budgeted with a 10% cut in mind,"" Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Illinois, said last week. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Florida, reorganized his office in December. ""We had to let people go then because we were anticipating at least a 16% cut,"" he said. Pentagon: Furloughs for civilian workers if forced cuts go into effect . But members of Congress, the very people who voted to put the automatic spending cuts in place, won't see any change to their annual salary of $174,000. Why? Because Congress can change its pay only by passing a law to do so. Before Congress left town for a week's recess, CNN took an informal survey and asked lawmakers whether they were willing to take a pay cut if the so-called sequester was set in motion on March 1. Most lawmakers in both parties said yes. ""Well, certainly. I mean, we're all in this together. We're all suffering together,"" said Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina. ""Absolutely. Let's make sure that we're doing our part as well,"" said Rep. Ben Lujan, D-New Mexico. ""Oh, sure. Yeah, I mean, that's called leadership,"" responded Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Florida. But cutting lawmaker pay isn't so easy. The 27th Amendment prohibits members of Congress from changing their compensation until after the next election. Still, they can get creative by writing checks to charity or the U.S. Treasury. Ironically, some tea party-backed lawmakers who campaigned on slashing federal spending are reluctant to give up their pay. Poll: Deficit is essential issue for Congress to tackle . Rep. Billy Long, R-Missouri, was elected in 2010 to cut Washington spending. ""Do you think members of Congress should take a pay cut?"" CNN asked. ""I don't think so,"" he responded. ""I mean, I don't think we should raise our pay."" But what about the fact that congressional aides may be furloughed? ""It's such a miniscule part,"" Long said. Former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann answered the question about whether she personally would take a pay cut -- asked several times -- by talking only about her staff. ""We'd like to keep everybody on the payroll if we can, but they'll have to work fewer hours. So, we're looking at reductions in our staff, and that's what we need to do,"" said the Minnesota Republican. CNNMoney: Biggest problems with forced budget cuts . Two members of Congress returned part of their office budgets to the Treasury this week. Standing in front of an oversized check for $600,000 -- or 20% of his budget -- Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said his office treated funds ""like it's our money, or your money, and we look at every expenditure."" Rand Paul returns more money to Treasury . Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-South Carolina, said he would return $160,000 to the federal government, or 12% of his office budget. One of the biggest opponents of Congress cutting its pay is one of the wealthiest, Nancy Pelosi. The House Democratic leader says she knows other members of Congress are not as financially fortunate. ""Most of my colleagues are the breadwinners in their families, said Pelosi. ""A pay cut, to me, doesn't mean as much."" CNNMoney: Federal worker furloughs could start in April .","Members of Congress also preparing for potential sharp cuts in federal spending .
But lawmakers will not see any change to their annual salary of $174,000 .

"(CNN) -- Back when I was a kid, they were called ""whistle-blowers"": employees of corrupt companies or government agencies, who went to the press with shocking stories of criminality or abuse. Daniel Ellsberg risked his life to leak the Pentagon Papers, which destroyed public support for the Vietnam War. Plutonium pellet maker Karen Silkwood was exposing malfeasance at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant when she was killed in an auto wreck. Jeffrey Wigand exposed Brown & Williamson's practice of intentionally manipulating the effect of nicotine in cigarettes, forcing Big Tobacco finally to admit the addictiveness of their product. Since the 1960s, dozens of brave, disillusioned Americans such as them have turned against employers who were breaking the law or otherwise harming humanity in some real way. They did so at the expense of their careers and sometimes even their lives. Somehow, the recent spate of similarly public defections of employees from the corporations they work for just doesn't feel like quite the same thing. Sure, it's pretty easy for most of us to agree with Greg Smith, the Goldman Sachs derivatives dealer who quit publicly via a New York Times OpEd  because ""the environment now is as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it."" Still, he's not complaining that Goldman Sachs is destroying the environment -- as in the air or the water -- through pollution. He's complaining about the corporate environment, the conversation in the corridors and the way the firm is choosing to make money. Instead of helping its clients make money, Smith says, the firm is now -- legally but unscrupulously -- putting its own needs first and fleecing its clients for whatever it can get. He is upset about the collapse of the corporate culture, its ability to create value for clients and the sustainability of the enterprise. Likewise, computer engineer James Whittaker, who left Microsoft in 2009 to work at Google, returned to Microsoft last month and fired off an angry public blog post about how Google is losing itself in a ""whirlwind of desperation."" He says that when he first went to Google, it was ""a technology company that empowered its employees to innovate."" Now, he complains, thanks to its obsession with promoting its Facebook-like Google+ service, ""The Google I left was an advertising company with a single corporate-mandated focus."" These gentlemen are garnering the same sorts of astonished headlines and outcry from their former employers and colleagues as did earlier generations of whistle-blowers. And while it may seem like they are turning against their companies, the real difference here is that they see themselves as speaking for their companies. These are not conflicts over corporate malfeasance, but over business plans! Smith believes it is not just more ethical, but better business for Goldman to think about serving its clients. He thinks it is a better long-term strategy for Goldman to help its clients make smart investments, rather than convincing them to make bad investments -- and then bet against those very same clients. Whittaker believes Google, the corporation, is turning its back on its greatest assets by focusing on advertising revenues instead of technological innovation. ""The trappings of entrepreneurship were dismantled,"" he explained, ""trappings"" being a good thing in this context. In short, this is not the way he thinks the corporation can succeed. Unlike whistle-blowers of the 20th century, this new breed of turncoats reveals just how far from questioning the corporate reality we have come. They become dissidents not by challenging corporate power, but by challenging their own corporation's methodology -- as if they would have been better CEOs themselves. In both cases, they accept the underlying corporate structures and the greater economic operating system in which they function as given circumstances. What they cannot see from their vantage point is that these companies are behaving in a manner totally consonant with their corporate agendas. The minute Google went public, its only priority was to serve its shareholders. Google is an advertising company. That's how it makes its revenue. Any technological innovations that don't serve this purpose -- and do so quickly -- will be questioned by shareholders and board members looking for big short-term gains. Likewise, Goldman is in the moneymaking business. They always have been. They are operating on a fiscal landscape where innovation is no longer valued, and where it's easier to make money the old-fashioned way (exploiting people dumber than you are). Occupy Wall Street kids figured this out months ago, and a few million mortgage-holders and retirees figured it out a few years ago: When you have to keep growing at the rate of interest to stay alive, you are going to start making stupid short-term decisions. In short, the kinds of sustainable, value-creating businesses these corporate escapees are calling for just can't happen within a corporate model based on borrowing, leverage and expansion. It's too little and too late for a few corporate whistle-blowers to tell us how the companies they work for are technically incompetent, distracted by revenues or losing the values that once made them great. It's time to blow the whistle on the whole thing.

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- The tech industry is currently all about mobile. Smartphones are seeing huge growth, and there are a huge number of players trying to get a slice of the money consumers are spending. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is the one big opportunity for companies to show off the models they are hoping will capture the imagination of customers. Like last year, the show belongs to Google. Almost all of the hot smart phones announced here run Android, Google's phone operating system that is making a decent fist of competing with the other main player in this space, Apple's iPhone. Read more: Google's Schmidt warns of 'digital caste system' The trouble is, if your company makes mobile phones, it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. Manufacturers are trying several ways to stand out at MWC this year, from a phone that becomes a tablet when you slide it into a separate dock, to a tablet you can draw on using a specially designed pen via a phone that has a projector inside it. To make the sameness worse, Android is designed so that anyone can take the software, put it on their phone and that it will work with the same experience. To try to avoid their products becoming commoditized, manufacturers have been customizing the software to make their mobiles feel different to the competition. This has been a mostly bad strategy as it has meant that, whenever Google has issued an update to the Android software, it has taken ages for the new version to make it through to ordinary consumers, and customers have been complaining in droves. Companies seem to have learned their lesson though, keeping the tweaks to their new models to a minimum. The other big trend is more mobile power. Quad-core processors are appearing inside all the manufacturers' high-end models, which gives them more speed than a typical computer from a few years ago. Whether consumers actually need all this power is an open question, but it opens the door to more exciting, realistic-looking games to appear on mobiles in the future. Trade shows are great levelers. If your product is good enough, you can make a big impact even if you are a small or unknown company. Huawei is one such company that could be giving the likes of Sony, Samsung and HTC some problems in the future, another is ZTE. Both have announced some high-end models that can easily compete with the very best in the industry, and they should be cheap too. Expect to hear more from these players in the future. But the star of the show is undoubtedly Nokia, which has stolen the headlines with the announcement of a mobile with a 41-megapixel camera -- that's significantly more megapixels than in most cameras people own. Read more: 41 megapixel camera phone . The idea is that it gives much better quality shots when you zoom in compared to a normal camera phone, which matters because there is no room for a big zoom lens on a typical mobile. The only downside is that it is running Symbian, the platform Nokia is in the process of dumping, rather than its operating system of choice, Windows Phone. But as a great show story, it can't be beaten. The elephant in the room is Apple. The company doesn't exhibit at Mobile World Congress, preferring to create buzz around its own events. But it still feels like it's everywhere. As yet, only Samsung has had much success in competing with Apple at the high end, but they are all watching what Apple does with interest and keeping their fingers crossed for a monster hit.

"London (CNN) -- Swaths of northern Europe were in the grip of snow, ice and high winds Tuesday, causing serious disruption to road, rail and air travelers. High-speed train operator Eurostar, which runs services linking Paris, Brussels and London, among other destinations, has canceled the rest of its services Tuesday and told passengers to stay at home. ""Severe weather conditions overnight in Northern France and Belgium have led to the closure of the high speed line,"" a notice on the company's website said. ""Passengers will not be able to travel on Eurostar services today and should not come to our stations."" About 10,000 passengers are likely to be affected as a result of the cancellation of around 24 out of 27 scheduled trains Tuesday, Eurostar spokeswoman Lucy Drake said. The bad weather may also affect services Wednesday, she said, with further cancellations or extended journey times possible . Passengers affected by the disruption will be offered exchanges or refunds, Drake said, and are urged to consider traveling next week if possible. Air travel has also been hit, with Germany's Frankfurt airport -- a major European hub -- canceling all flights for several hours as it worked to clear its runways. Some 700 out of a total 1,238 flights have been canceled so far, affecting roughly 7,000 passengers, airport spokesman Christopher Holschier told CNN. Two of Frankfurt's four runways reopened for takeoff and landing as of 5 p.m. local time, Holschier said, but snow continues to fall. Holschier said passengers were resigned to the situation as they were well aware of the adverse conditions. ""Already, getting to the airport has been an ordeal,"" he said. Meanwhile, the official Twitter feed for the two main airports in Paris warned that travel disruptions in the French capital were making access to the airports difficult. However, train and bus services were starting to get back to normal in the afternoon, it said. A quarter of flights from Paris Charles de Gaulle and one in five flights from Paris-Orly were canceled Tuesday in anticipation of the heavy snowfall, the two airports said Monday. Travelers were advised to check on their flight's status before heading to the airport. London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schiphol airports have also reported snow in the past 24 hours. Whiteout conditions . Late-winter blasts like these are nothing new for central Europe, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. In fact, in Germany they have something known as MÃ¤rzwinter, or ""March winter,"" said Miller. The phenomenon occurs in mid-March when, after a period of spring-like warmth early in the month that often sees trees and flowers begin to bloom, cold northerly winds bring mid-winter type weather back to the country. True to form, last week there were seven consecutive days of above-average temperatures in Frankfurt. The mercury peaked Saturday with a high of 17 degrees Celsius (about 62 degrees Fahrenheit), the kind of temperature usually expected in mid-May. On Tuesday, however, winter returned with a vengeance, dropping 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) of snow by noon. In addition to the snow, winds have gusted to 50 and 60 kilometers per hour (31 to 37 mph), creating whiteout conditions and making travel even more difficult. Northern France has taken the brunt of the storm, with some locations seeing up to 40 centimeters (about 16 inches) of snow. Gusty winds have created snow drifts a meter deep or more. Meteo-France has issued a Red Warning -- its highest level -- for snow and ice through Wednesday morning. The wintry blast also caused problems for motorists in southeast England, with some trapped in their vehicles overnight by accidents and road closures on icy highways in Kent and Sussex. Conditions should improve by Wednesday, as the frontal system pushes south and loses some of its intensity, but the cold temperatures will remain through the end of the week.","NEW: Germany's Frankfurt airport, a major European hub, cancels 700 flights .

"(CNN) -- Rhode Island moved toward becoming the 10th state in the nation and the last in New England to approve same-sex marriage after its state Senate voted Wednesday to approve a bill extending marriage rights. Senators approved the bill 26-12 Wednesday afternoon. Though the House version of the bill passed by a vote of 51 to 19 in January, the Senate amended it, ""so it needs to go back to the House, where it has solid support,"" Senate press secretary Greg Pare said. The House could vote on the amended version as soon as next week, he said. Governor Lincoln Chafee, an independent, has indicated support for the measure. The Senate Republican Caucus on Tuesday expressed unanimous support for the bill. The Rhode Island Catholic Conference said Tuesday in a statement posted on its website that it appreciated that exemptions for religious organizations had been included in the bill. ""Unfortunately, the exemptions fail to protect individuals and small businesses who believe that marriage is a union of one man and one woman,"" it said. Scott Spear, an advisory board member of the Rhode Island chapter of the National Organization for Marriage, said he would have preferred the fate of the bill be decided in a public referendum rather than by the Senate. ""We believe the record of marriage as has existed throughout the history of civilization stands for an empirical truth, and that truth is a marriage is a union between one man and one woman,"" he said in a telephone interview. Iowa, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Washington and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage. Their combined populations, based on U.S. Census estimates for 2012, represent 15.8% of the U.S. population. The addition of Rhode Island's 1,050,292 residents would nudge that up to 16.1%. For some lawmakers, the issue transcends politics. During a debate Tuesday over reversing Nevada's law banning same-sex marriage, state Sen. Kelvin Atkinson revealed that the issue is a personal one for him. ""I'm black, I'm gay,"" he said. ""I know this is the first time many of you have heard me say that I am a black, gay male."" ""It was an impulse decision,"" he said Wednesday in a phone interview with CNN, adding that he had not planned on saying anything in the session. ""I felt it was time to do it."" The Nevada Senate voted 12-9 to start the process to repeal the gay marriage ban.","Rhode Island is poised to become the nation's 10th state to approve same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Robert Zimmerman Jr., the brother of the man who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, apologized for his controversial and offensive tweets. In one, Zimmerman juxtaposed a photograph of Martin with one of 17-year-old De'Marquise Elkins, one of two teenagers charged with killing a baby in Georgia. Both Elkins and Martin appear to be flipping off the camera. ""A picture speaks a thousand words. Any questions?"" the tweet reads. In another tweet, Zimmerman writes: ""Lib media shld ask if what these2 black teens did 2 a woman&baby is the reason ppl think blacks mightB risky."" Speaking on CNN's Piers Morgan Live on Wednesday night, he apologized for the messages, saying they weren't the ""right thing to do."" ""I realize those were controversial and offensive and I did publicly apologize for them,"" he said. ""I'm a human being. I'm being upfront about what I did. I made a mistake ... Unfortunately (it) may not have helped George."" 5 things to know about the case . His brother, George Zimmerman, has been charged with second-degree murder. Zimmerman acknowledged shooting Martin but said it was in self-defense. Attorneys for Martin's family have accused Zimmerman of racially profiling Martin and shooting him ""in cold blood."" Robert Zimmerman Jr. said he was trying to make a larger point in his tweets about the ""media and their honesty in portraying the person who encountered my brother February 26, 2012. Letters to Zimmerman show split opinions . ""We've been led to believe that it's a junior-high-school-aged person because of the pictures,"" he said, referring to Martin. ""The analogy is these are two people who chose to represent themselves in this way. One was accused of killing a baby, and whatever's in his social media makes the rounds immediately ... However, the other person who almost killed my brother had he disarmed him -- my brother had every indication to believe he would have killed him -- his social media is off limits."" Chief witness in Martin case lied under oath . Zimmerman's tweets prompted a response from his brother's defense team. Attorney Mark O'Mara told CNN's ""Starting Point"" Thursday morning that Robert Zimmerman doesn't represent his brother or his defense. ""Having said that, I'm not sure where (Robert's) heart was, but I've always said for the past year that we have to have a conversation about race, and the Zimmerman case has brought it to the forefront, particularly the way young black males are treated in the system,"" O'Mara said. ""These type of tweets ... were insensitive to that, and quite honestly are the opposite of what I hope the conversation would be to try and figure out what's wrong with the system and maybe a good way to fix it."" O'Mara said he worries about how Robert Zimmerman's tweets will affect George's case. ""Everything that happens in this case is, if not overblown, hyper-focused upon, so that everything that George says or does is important,"" O'Mara said ""... And certainly when a family member of my client says something that comes across as totally insensitive -- if not much, much worse -- (it) has an effect, and now we have to deal with it.""

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Google is making some changes to its most well-known product: search. The tweaks, updates and beta projects are all part of Google's attempt to make searches faster and more relevant. For starters, Google is bringing its Siri-esque voice search feature to the iPad and iPhone. The company expects to roll out an update to its free Google Search app later this week with the new feature, which uses speech-recognition technology to understand spoken, natural language search requests. Though it has not yet been approved, Google said it is working with Apple to get the app out. Depending on how you phrase your question or request, the app will bring up text answers and images or play YouTube videos. The app also can give answers specific to your location, such as movie times or weather. For example, ""Play the sleepy kitten video"" should automatically bring up and start playing a video of said exhausted feline, and ""What's the weather here next week?"" will show a weather report for that exact period. The version of this search-by-voice feature was already available for Android 4.1 users, and Google says it will be available for older versions of Android at some point in the future. There also are some subtle changes coming to English versions of the search engine around the world, starting Thursday. Auto-predict, the sometimes amusing feature that shows popular search terms that start with the words you are typing, will be joined by smarter, more relevant suggestions. The feature works by tapping the company's knowledge graph, which is a database of more than 500 million ""objects."" An object can be anything in the real world, such as a location, public figure, movie, sports team or company. For example, a search for ""Luxor"" will suggest the Las Vegas casino, the city and the original Egyptian temple in search field. Another new feature is the knowledge carousel -- a collection of frequently mentioned results for certain search terms that will appear as a row of thumbnail images at the top of the screen. A search for famous astronauts will bring up images of relevant people, along with dates of birth and death. Clicking on one of these links updates the page's search results to show links about that person. It also works for other things such as locations, museums, animals or albums. The final feature announced Wednesday is a beta project that loops your Gmail account into the search results. When the feature is on, Google will search the Web as well as all the e-mails in your account and include a list of relevant e-mails or contacts on the side of your screen. For some common queries, Google will parse the e-mails to isolate key bits of information, much like travel app TripIt. A search for ""my flights"" will pull flight information for upcoming trips you may have booked, and present it along with data from the Web, like an updated flight status. The feature has been tested by several thousand Google employees, and now the company is opening up the trial to a test group of a million. Anyone can sign up to try the feature at g.co/searchtrial, although it will only work on the main Google.com site in English. These tweaks are the survivors of a huge number of experiments Google has done for search. In 2011, the search team conducted 58,000 experiments on search and made 530 tweaks to how search works. Google says it has found more than 30 trillion unique URLs on the Web, crawls 20 billion sites a day and processes 100 billion searches every month. Amit Singhal, Google's senior vice president of engineering, said the changes bring Google one step closer to his dream of being like Capt. Kirk on ""Star Trek"" and using the starship computer to find out anything he needed to know. ""The destiny of search is to become that 'Star Trek' computer,"" he said.","Google is bringing Siri-like voice search features to its iPhone and iPad app .
Search engine will now return suggestions for topics you are trying to search .
A new Gmail search tool is available as a beta project ."
"(CNN) -- Apple sue us next? Not a chance. That's the gist of Google's message following Apple's $1 billion victory over Samsung in a California patent suit. The search giant is doing its best to quell fears that its Android operating system could be the next target for Apple's lawyers. And you can't blame them. Google has to do something to keep its partners in the smartphone and tablet world from panicking, to say nothing of investors. But experts say that while the Apple v. Samsung suit didn't describe a legal route that leads directly to Mountain View, Google had better watch its back. Apple v. Samsung ripped apart both the hardware and software used in Samsung's very popular smartphones and tablets. Arguments hinged on whether certain hardware features -- like a bezeled display and a lozenge-shaped earpiece -- had been ripped off from Apple by Samsung's designers. A jury decided that in multiple instances they had. Apple also filed claims that Samsung developed operating system features that violated Apple patents. Samsung licenses Google's Android operating system for its tablets and phones, and makes changes to personalize the user experience. Those small changes include pinch-to-zoom, tap-to-zoom, and bounce-back features, which fall under Apple-owned utility patents. Google, which has stayed silent about the case until now, said Monday that these utility patent features aren't part of the core Android operating system, which runs underneath Samsung's and other device manufacturer's modifications. Google gives its licensees a plain, stock version of the Android operating system, which by itself does not violate Apple's patents. However, licensees can modify the Android system and build any feature they like, and those features could violate other patented technologies. Here's Google's full statement in reaction to the verdict: . ""The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office. The mobile industry is moving fast and all players -- including newcomers -- are building upon ideas that have been around for decades. We work with our partners to give consumers innovative and affordable products, and we don't want anything to limit that."" Phillip Philbin, an intellectual property attorney with national law firm Haynes and Boone, says Google's statement is a message to its partners that the verdict only applies to Samsung's products, and not the entire Android ecosystem. ""It's essentially Google saying that the patent issues apply to Samsung's software changes and Samsung's hardware, but not to 'core' Android or other Android products,"" says Philbin. Looking at the case, Purdue law professor Mark McKenna says Google is focusing on distancing itself from the pinch-to-zoom, the tap-to-zoom, and the bounce-back features that Samsung created, saying they aren't included in its base Android code. ""Google's claim is that those features are part of the modified experience from other companies that license the Android operating system,"" says McKenna. Analysts agree with Google's stance, saying there is no evidence out there that the core Android operating system has infringed on Apple or any other company's patents. But Google has yet to endure the scrutiny of a full-blown patent suit. The California jury was looking at what Samsung did or didn't do, not what Google did or didn't do. That's a key distinction. But if Google has its way, no jury will ever test its claims. Google has gone to great lengths to keep its operating system distinct from iOS with widgets, rotary and pull-tab lock screens, and an applications menu separate from the home screen. All very un-Apple-like design flourishes. Even Google's Nexus hardware line, made with Samsung, HTC, and Asus, includes designs with rounded corners, curved screens, and textured battery covers that could never be mistaken for an Apple device. Still Google is not immune to a patent lawsuit, even though it wouldn't be easy for Apple -- or anyone else -- to bring a case. One of the chief reasons Apple hasn't yet gone after Google, McKenna says, is because Google doesn't make any money from selling the Android operating system (it makes money from mobile ads). Since Google is giving away Android, it makes it hard for Apple to prove that the operating system harms its market share. ""That doesn't mean Apple couldn't sue Google, it just makes it more challenging to prove the direct impact,"" says McKenna. ""That's why Apple's gone the indirect route, by suing device manufacturers that can modify Android."" And it's not inconceivable that Apple eventually decides to go directly after Google, McKenna says. If it gets on a winning streak in U.S. courts against the rest of the handset makers, it might take a shot. ""This is Act 1 in a multi-act play,"" says McKenna. ""Apple is on the record saying they want to destroy the Android ecosystem, and to do that it's either going have to go after the all the software makers, or every single hardware manufacturer that sells these things."" Whether its Apple going after its next victim, or the Samsung case going to appeal, Philbin agrees there is a long way to go. ""Patent litigation takes place on at least three fronts â€” the district court, the patent office and the federal circuit,"" he says. ""What we've had so far is just the district court's ruling and we haven't even heard from the District Judge on this yet. So this process is far from over."" The legal process perhaps, but as is the case in the fast-moving tech world, the design process has already moved on. Pick up the latest Samsung smartphone and you won't see the hardware or software features that the jury found violated Apple's patents. Samsung has learned its lesson, albeit in a very expensive way. Google already has a tight grip on Android, and you're likely to see that grip tighten as it looks to avoid any of its own patent litigation woes. The good news for consumers is that rather than waiting for jury verdicts in the future, there's a good chance we'll be waiting for the next crop of smartphones and tablets with forms and features that are distinct -- not just a bunch of Apple copycats.

"(CNN) -- Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, the annual gathering where the secretive company hosts folks who make a living writing software for its products, kicks off today. And while the event is designed around presentations to help developers, its keynote address has also become an opportunity for Apple to roll out new products not just to developers, but to the world. Two iPhones and several Macs have had their coming-out parties at WWDC, along with a host of operating-system overhauls. Which raises the obvious question: What will Apple announce at its keynote, set for 1 pm ET? Speculation has run rampant, as it does every time the Cupertino, California-based computing giant moves a muscle. But some of the guesses make more sense than others. Here's a look at some of the most credible reports, with our take on the odds of them being even vaguely true. Software updates . This one isn't as sexy as a big product unveiling, but software is the bread-and-butter of WWDC. And there might be some drama here, yet. It's about time for a first look at iOS 6, an update of the mobile operating system that runs iPhones, iPads and Apple's other Web-enabled mobile devices. The developers in attendance will no doubt hang on every detail. But the most high-profile change is expected to be Apple's announcement that it's replacing Google Maps with its own mapping app as the system's default. Apple and Google have obviously squared off in the mobile space, with more smartphones now running Google's Android system, even though the iPhone remains the single most popular phone. Supplanting Google's popular maps on its millions of mobile devices would be a big blow in the rivals' ongoing slugfest. Looking to get the jump on Apple, Google announced new features to Google Maps on Wednesday, including more 3-D images and the ability to use the product even when you're offline. Interestingly, Google only announced the update for people using its own Android mobile operating system. Developers also may get a closer look at OS X Mountain Lion, the Mac operating system scheduled for release this summer. Odds: Bet the farm. Refreshed Macs . Of the nonsoftware speculation, this one feels like the most likely -- and could be pretty significant. For one, It's been a year or more since Apple's major desktop and laptop models have been updated. The iMac got refreshed in May 2011, the MacBook Pro's last overhaul was February 2011 and MacBook Air's latest model rolled out in July of last year. Second, apps have started showing up in the Mac app store with updates saying they've added ""retina graphics."" That's the term Apple uses for its high-resolution displays on newer iPhones and iPads and suggests that Macs might be getting similar treatment. Plus, the online Apple Store was down Monday morning, suggesting that new hardware is on the way. Apple followers have already been passing around reports that the company could unveil a 15-inch Macbook Pro in a big rollout that might include most of its other Mac products. Announcing now would mean that Apple would have fresh products to push before back-to-school and off-to-college time, not to mention the holidays. Odds: Get your chips on the table. Apple TV . A television set from Apple has been the most elusive and speculated-about piece of vaporware in the tech world for the past year. Whether it's been snippets of info from Apple's supply chain, suggestive notes from retailers or the always talkative ""unnamed sources,"" most observers seem to agree it's just a matter of time before the company goes from offering a set-top box like Roku, Boxee or TiVo to selling its own TVs. Could Monday be the day we finally see it? Maybe ... but it doesn't feel likely. Instead, look for another update to the Apple TV system, the little box that lets users stream movies and other content from iTunes to their TVs. Such a move could be a step towards Apple launching the TV set itself. One report says the company will introduce a kit for third-party developers who want to build apps for the Apple TV device. By Apple standards, Apple TV hasn't been a big seller yet. And things are getting more interesting in that space. Last week, Microsoft announced Xbox SmartGlass, a system that will synch that gaming and entertainment console with mobile devices like iPads and iPhones. Odds: Even money at best. A new iPhone . As of this writing, longshot Guyana Star Dweej is getting 60-to-1 odds to win Saturday's Belmont Stakes. If those odds seem way too good for you, bet on a new iPhone be unveiled Monday. Yes, new iPhones were unveiled at WWDC in 2009 and 2010. But last year's iPhone 4S didn't hit the market until October. It would be out of character for the company to roll out another one eight months later. Sorry, folks. Check back this fall. Same goes for the iPad and iPods. New iPods usually get their own fall events, and the ""new iPad"" is barely three months old. Even Apple doesn't crank out updates that fast. Odds: Slim, meet none.","Apple's developers conference kicks off with a keynote at 1 pm ET today .
Apple will reveal features of iOS 6, its operating system for iPhones and iPads .
Company could also unveil its replacement for Google Maps on iPhone, iPad .
We may also see upgrades to the Apple TV device that streams iTunes content ."
"(CNN) -- Crews sprayed foam Wednesday to extinguish pockets of fire remaining at a Texas chemical plant two days after a massive blaze sent bright flames and thick plumes of smoke high into the sky. Authorities were still investigating what caused the blaze at the Magnablend plant about 30 miles south of Dallas. Investigators were also trying to determine whether harmful amounts of chemicals had been released. ""The Environmental Protection Agency is continuously monitoring air quality in the area of the fire and downwind from the site and as of noon Wednesday have not detected significant levels of chemicals in the air,"" said a statement released by the city of Waxahachie, Texas. Magnablend CEO Scott Pendery told reporters Tuesday that an electrical spark may have led to the blaze, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. But he was less specific about what was going on inside the plant, WFAA said. ""I don't want to reach out and try to suggest exactly what each employee was doing at that time,"" Pendery said, according to WFAA. ""There's a variety of events that go on in that plant."" When pressed, Pendery told the CNN affiliate that the plant was producing some chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking. ""Some of those products that we make in that plant do get used in that application,"" Pendery told WFAA. But he declined to detail specific chemicals involved at the plant. The fracking process injects water, sand and chemicals deep into the ground, cracking the shale and unleashing natural gas. There have been growing calls from environmental activists to halt fracking until the environmental concerns and benefits are fully studied. There are concerns that the chemicals used in fracking have caused illnesses, gas leaks, even tap water catching fire -- something covered extensively in media reports and in the Emmy-winning natural gas documentary ""Gasland."" The Environmental Protection Agency is still studying the claims and is scheduled to release its findings in late 2012. On Monday, Dave Bary -- a Dallas-based spokesman for the EPA -- said the most prevalent chemical that the plant's owner had documented, and produced on site, was anhydrous ammonia. The EPA official said earlier Monday that 48,630 pounds of the chemical, which creates a toxic vapor downwind when released, have been reported at the site. It was not known how much of the chemical was released into the air during the fire. Officials ordered the evacuation of a school, an apartment building and other industrial sites within an eight-block radius of the plant, said Diana Buckley, an official with Ellis County government. Employees and visitors of the plant evacuated safely, plant officials said. Two employees sustained minor injuries but were not hospitalized, the company said in a statement. CNN affiliates KTVT and WFAA showed orange flames devouring buildings and licking at tanker cars parked at the edge of the Magnablend plant, which is about 30 miles south of Dallas. Officials have said burning liquid continued to fuel the flames hours after it began, but they appeared able to wrestle the fire under control by early Monday evening. Magnablend produces custom chemicals for a variety of industries, including oil, agriculture, pet and animal feed, water treatment, construction and industrial cleaning companies, according to its website. Anhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, eye contact and skin contact. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Dave Alsup and Sarah Hoye contributed to this report.","City: EPA tests have not found significant levels of chemicals in the air .

"(CNN) -- Google plans to start combining information the company collects about each user of its various websites and services into a single profile, the company announced on Tuesday. Previously, Google said it did not create comprehensive profiles across its various properties, including its leading search engine, Android smartphone operating system and YouTube video site. In a statement, Alma Whitten, a Google privacy director, wrote that the changes ""will mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience."" She added, ""Our recently launched personal search feature is a good example of the cool things Google can do when we combine information across products."" That change, called Google Search Plus Your World, brought criticism from rivals Facebook and Twitter, which said that Google+ content now buries their own pages in Google's search engine, and from people who do not care to use Google's new social network. The new privacy policy, too, has already sparked concerns voiced on social networks, including on Google's own platform. ""Google consolidating data -- gives me some cause for concern,"" Robert Mason, a professor of information technology at the University of Washington, wrote publicly on his Google+ profile. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment and instead referred CNN to Whitten's statement and a brief document posted on the company's website. The latter notes that Google does not sell users' personal info to other companies, and that people who do not like the changes can close their accounts. Google uses some of the data it collects based on people's usage in order to deliver advertisements customized to individuals. Whitten boasted in her company blog post that the single, shorter privacy policy should appease government regulators who have called for simplifications across the industry. Facebook made a similar claim last year when it removed much of the legal jargon from its privacy agreement. Google's new privacy policy will go into effect on March 1. It applies to everyone who is logged into a Google account while searching, checking Gmail, watching YouTube videos or downloading apps to an Android phone. The company plans to send e-mails to users and post a notification on its home page about the changes, Whitten wrote.","Google announces changes to its privacy policy .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration announced Sunday that it will begin enhanced screening procedures Monday on any U.S.-bound air passenger traveling through ""state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest"" such as Pakistan, Yemen and Nigeria. The TSA said in a statement announcing the new measures that ""effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders."" A senior government official, not authorized to speak on the record, provided CNN with the full list of 14 countries that fall under the TSA's ""countries of interest"" label -- which will automatically trigger the enhanced screening. The State Department lists four countries as those that sponsor terror: Cuba, Sudan, Syria and Iran. The other 10 countries of interest are Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen, the government official said. Another source, a senior State Department official who could not speak on the record due to the sensitive nature of the material, said the countries on the list are places ""where we have concerns, particularly about al Qaeda affiliates."" The official said the State Department was heavily involved in compiling the list, along with Department of Homeland Security and other intelligence agencies. The State Department compiles the annual ""Patterns of Global Terrorism"" report, which details terrorism trends in countries around the world. Passengers from other countries could still face enhanced security for other reasons. Unlike many TSA security directives, this one does not have an expiration date and is intended to be ""sustainable and long term,"" although the TSA will continually evaluate the mandate in light of intelligence, a federal counterterrorism official told CNN. The TSA said any person flying into the United States who is ""traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening."" The TSA did not elaborate on what those enhanced security procedures might entail. The directive was issued to domestic and international air carriers. In addition, the directive also keeps in place a mandate -- issued after an attempted Christmas Day terror attack on a U.S.-bound flight -- giving pilots discretion to prevent passengers from keeping pillows and blankets on their laps during certain international flights, the official said. Also retained is the option for pilots to limit movement in the cabin on those international flights. Federal authorities have charged Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, of Nigeria, in connection with the failed Christmas Day attack on a flight between the Netherlands and Detroit, Michigan. Authorities have said he tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight made its final approach to Detroit. The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at his seat. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","TSA: Travel to U.S. from ""state sponsors of terrorism"" would trigger enhanced screening .

"(CNN) -- At least 34 people have died and 80 are injured in Pakistan after a powerful earthquake struck near the country's border with Iran, sources tell CNN. Army doctors and Frontier Corps paramilitary forces are taking part in rescue efforts in Mashakel, according to a Pakistani official involved in relief efforts. Officials earlier said that dozens more were injured in both countries. Akbar Hussain Durrani, home minister of Pakistan's Balochistan province, confirmed that six people had died and more than a dozen were injured in the province's Washuk district. The quake injured a dozen people in southeastern Iran, authorities said. They were treated at a hospital, the Crisis Management Office of Sistan and Baluchestan province reported. No one was killed, said Reza Arbabi, the office's director. Sistan and Baluchestan province borders Pakistan and Afghanistan. Earlier Tuesday, Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency quoted a politician from the province as saying that 40 people had been killed in the earthquake. However, Arbabi and Sistan and Baluchestan Gov.-general Hatam Narouie disputed that there were deaths. Fars later quoted Narouie as saying, ""Fortunately, the quake did not cause any deaths or serious property damage. Telephone lines are now working, and water and electricity (are) normal."" Narouie told Fars that the news outlet should rely only on information from the crisis office. Damage in Pakistan . The quake destroyed more than 50 shops in the Washuk district, Durrani said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was preliminarily measured at 7.8 magnitude. The Iranian Seismological Center said the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5. ""Thank God it doesn't appear that there is too much destruction,"" a disaster official said on a broadcast by Iran's IRIB from the city of Khosk. The official described seeing five injured people and some cracked or collapsed walls but no sign of major damage. The Iranian Red Crescent has dispatched five assessment teams to the region, the aid group said Tuesday. Interactive map: World's biggest earthquakes since 1900 . State of emergency . The epicenter of the quake, which struck about 3:15 p.m. local time, was about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the city of Saravan, according to the Iranian Seismological Center. A state of emergency has been declared in the Saravan area, and rescue workers have been deployed from other provinces, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported. ""Our teams have been deployed to the area for the first rapid assessment, but they have not reported back yet,"" said Hassan Esfandiar, head of communications for the Iranian Red Crescent. The area is rural and sparsely populated, leading to hopes that casualty figures may not climb much higher. Carrieann Bedwell, a USGS seismologist, said a 7.8-magnitude quake was ""a large event for any area"" and could be expected to cause damage in inhabited places. No effects have been reported on any nuclear plants in the region. The earthquake caused no damage to Bushehr nuclear power facility in Iran, the Iran Nuclear Regulatory Authority told the International Atomic Energy Association. Interactive: Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes . Aftershocks can be expected for days or weeks after a quake of that magnitude, she said. The USGS placed the epicenter 53 miles east-southeast of Khash, 103 miles northeast of Iranshahr and 123 miles southeast of Zahedan. It initially said the quake had a depth of 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) but later revised that to 82 kilometers (51 miles.) Shafiq Ahmed, an official with Pakistan's meteorological department, said the tremor, which he put at magnitude 7.9, struck inside southern Iran, near the border with Pakistan. Tremors were felt in southern Pakistan, including the city of Karachi, and across Balochistan province from Gwadar on the southern coast to Quetta and the border with Iran. 'Children were crying' Taghi Akhavan, an employee at Shaygan Hotel on the Iranian resort island of Kish, said he felt the quake about 3:30 p.m. local time. He said several guests also reported feeling what they described as a mild tremor, but the hotel did not evacuate guests. He said he has not seen any damage. Journalist Rabia Ali was among those to feel the quake in Karachi. ""I was at home. I was in my bed, and the bed started moving for a good 15 seconds,"" she said. ""We realized it was an earthquake, and we started evacuating. Everyone came out onto the street and started praying. The children were crying."" She said that she had not seen any damage in her neighborhood and that things have now calmed down. The earthquake was felt as far away as Abu Dhabi, where buildings shook for 40 seconds or more, but it's not clear what damage has been caused across the region. Follow the story on CNN Arabic . The lest earthquake comes on the heels of another last week in southern Iran, which left at least 37 people dead. That quake, centered near the city of Kaki, was measured at magnitude 6.3. It did not damage the Bushehr nuclear plant, just over 60 miles away, according to Iranian state media. CNN's Reza Sayah, Mitra Mobasherat, Brian Walker, Jo Shelley, Nasir Habib, Leone Lakhani, Saima Mohsin and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","NEW: 34 people dead; 80 injured in Pakistan, sources say .

"(CNN) -- Weeks after a policy change that sparked privacy concerns, Google has rolled out a new feature that will give users a monthly update to help them keep track of their activity across Google's multiple sites and tools. It's called Account Activity, and users can receive it via e-mail with a link to a password-protected personal page. The feature was announced Wednesday in a post on Google's official blog. ""Every day, we aim to make technology so simple and intuitive that you stop thinking about it -- we want Google to work so well it just blends into your life,"" Andreas Tuerk, a product manager for Google, wrote in the post. ""But sometimes it's helpful to step back and take stock of what you're doing online."" The report is not automatic, meaning users will have to sign up to receive it. Based on a sample report, information such as your number of Google searches, your most popular search topics and the number of e-mails sent and received will be included. It also will show locations where your account was used and the devices that were used to sign into it, which Tuerk called an extra layer of security. ""Knowing more about your own account activity also can help you take steps to protect your Google Account,"" he wrote. ""For example, if you notice sign-ins from countries where you haven't been or devices you've never owned, you can change your password immediately and sign up for the extra level of security provided by two-step verification."" On March 1, Google instigated a new privacy policy in which it creates a single profile of each user based on their activity across all of its many products -- from search to Gmail to mobile devices that run on Google's Android operating system. Privacy advocates, including some in Congress, fear that puts too much personal information in the company's hands. But Google said it wouldn't be collecting any new information -- just collating what data it already had in a way that would be more clear and help create new products and features for its users. Wednesday's blog post from Google made no mention of the new privacy policy. But many tech observers were quick to make the connection, saying it looks like a way to make users more comfortable. ""If you're confused about what Google does and doesn't know about your online activity, take heart: Google is letting you in on the secret,"" Network World writer Brad Reed wrote. Others saw potential for another goal behind the rollout -- reminding folks how ubiquitous the Web giant has become online. ""While the report is something of a data nerds' dream, its timely arrival hints at another purpose,"" wrote Sarah Perez of TechCrunch. ""The new Account Activity report offers a way for users to see exactly what they're doing on Google, and how much of their life involves the use of Google's products.""","Google Account Activity gives users a monthly look at what they did online .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- The MacBook Pro, with a shiny new high-definition screen, may have been the sexiest star of Apple's keynote address at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. But updates to its mobile operating system may make the biggest impact on users in the months, and years, to come. And they both clearly target Google, Apple's fellow tech titan and, increasingly, its key rival. A brand new map system, complete with 3-D imaging and voice-assisted, turn-by-turn navigation is clearly Apple's effort to keep iPhone and iPad users home instead of clicking on what had been the system's go-to app, Google Maps. And an upgrade to Siri looks to turn the iPhone 4S's feature from a novelty with a few useful applications into the full-fledged ""digital assistant"" the company promises, with voice-activated search being a key component. Some might view these changes as continuing the late Steve Jobs' feud with Google over what he felt was that company's theft of iPhone features for its mobile Android system. ""I'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this,"" Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, after suing Google in 2010. At least one expert on Monday saw Apple's latest moves as a strategic way to limit Google's mobile growth. ""We believe the biggest takeaway is that Apple is strengthening not only the interaction within its own ecosystem, but also creating a consortium of powerful web partners to offer an experience that largely falls outside of Google's walls,"" said Gene Munster, an industry analyst with Piper Jaffray. ""We believe Apple will continue to add content partners for Siri to marginalize Google's presence on the iPhone."" Even enhanced Facebook integration (it's cooked right in to iOS 6, making sharing to the site seamless), can be seen as a jab at Google's efforts to gain a foothold in the social media world with Google+. But it was Maps which may have marked the most direct anti-Google move. Google has been providing mapping information to Apple since the iPhone launched in 2007. ""In iOS 6, we have built an entire new mapping system from the ground up; and it looks beautiful,"" Scott Forstall, Apple's vice president in charge of the mobile system, said Monday. ""This is a worldwide effort. We're covering the world."" There was turn-by-turn navigation, with voice assistance delivered in the same voice that iPhone 4 users know as Siri. And then there were the stylistic flourishes Apple has made its trademark, like ""Flyover,"" images recorded from planes and helicopters that give the user a panoramic look at their location from just about any angle. Google didn't have much to say Monday, handing out a brief, basic statement. ""We've been working on maps for years, in fact just announced some exciting new developments for Google Maps and Google Earth last week and are looking forward to continuing to build the perfect map for our users in the months and years ahead,"" a spokesperson said. Google clearly saw at least that part of the broadside coming. In anticipation of the Apple announcement, Google announced a set of improvements last week to Google Maps in what it called part of ""the never-ending quest for the perfect map."" Significantly, 3-D modeling, one of the features touted by Apple on Monday, was among the upgrades. And the ""never-ending quest"" bit highlights one of Google's perceived advantages here. And Google has, in fact, been working on mapping the world since Maps was introduced in 2004. Duplicating those efforts with an essentially new product will be a tall order for Apple, and if it doesn't work smoothly from the outset, users will find it easy to migrate back. Another, more subtle swipe at a Google stronghold, came voiced by Siri. The iPhone voice assistant, which will soon be available for the new iPad, has been fun for the past eight months. But now, Apple wants to make her more useful. She's learned how to give you sports scores. And movie times. And restaurant recommendations. You know ... the sort of things you now Google. The iOS update is scheduled to roll out this fall (which, not coincidentally, is around the time analysts expect a new iPhone to be introduced). That's plenty of time for Apple to build buzz around the new features. But it's also plenty of time for Google to roll out something new of its own. The company hasn't been shy about encroaching on what Apple considered its own turf. The relative success of Google's Android operating system, which is now on more phones than Apple's iOS, hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. All of which means tech consumers might be able to just sit back and reap the benefits.","Apple hopes new map system keeps users away from Google Maps .

"(CNN) -- Syria's air force has repeatedly carried out ""indiscriminate, and in some cases deliberate"" airstrikes against civilians, Human Rights Watch said in a new report. The attacks are serious violations of international humanitarian law, and those who commit such violations with criminal intent are responsible for war crimes, the rights group said. The claims are laid out in an 80-page report titled ""Death from the Skies,"" based on visits to 50 sites of government airstrikes in opposition-controlled areas in Aleppo, Idlib and Latakia provinces. The group's researchers carried out more than 140 interviews with witnesses and victims. ""In village after village, we found a civilian population terrified by their country's own air force,"" said Ole Solvang, a researcher for the rights group, who visited the sites and conducted many of the interviews. ""These illegal airstrikes killed and injured many civilians and sowed a path of destruction, fear and displacement."" Human Rights Watch said bakeries and hospitals have been targeted, in violation of the laws of war. But Sharif Shahadeh, a lawmaker in the Syrian parliament, questioned the accuracy of the Human Rights Watch report. Syrian jihad group pledges allegiance to al Qaeda . No military target, group says . For the report, Human Rights Watch documented in detail eight airstrikes on four bakeries. Its research ""indicates government forces targeted bakeries and civilians waiting in breadlines in airstrikes as well as in artillery attacks,"" the group said. ""For each of these attacks, Human Rights Watch was not able to identify any military target, such as fighters or weapons, in the vicinity."" It cites the Syrian Revolution General Commission, a local opposition group, as saying Syrian forces have attacked 78 bakeries across Syria, either by airstrikes or artillery shelling. Repeated airstrikes on two hospitals in the areas Human Rights Watch visited ""strongly suggest that the government also deliberately targeted these facilities."" The rights group accuses the Syrian armed forces of using means such as unguided bombs, and methods such as fighter jets and high-flying helicopters, ""that under the circumstances could not distinguish between civilians and combatants, and thus were indiscriminate."" Altogether, the airstrikes documented by Human Rights Watch killed at least 152 civilians, though the actual number is probably higher. According to a network of local Syrian activists, airstrikes have killed more than 4,300 civilians across Syria since July 2012, the rights group said. CNN is unable to independently confirm reports of casualties in Syria because access by international media is heavily restricted. White House signs off on new aid . 'Political accusations' Shahadeh, the pro-government lawmaker, told CNN Arabic that the information available to lawmakers, based on intelligence reports, indicates ""that the Syrian military air force only strike the locations of the terrorist armed groups,"" the term the government uses for rebel forces. ""For months, the majority of the reports issued by international organizations and some even by the United Nations include blatant political accusations rather than factual or technical investigations. ""There is no benefit for the regime to target civilians who are already suffering from the criminal acts carried out by the terrorist organizations that the regime troops are fighting."" The Syrian government has accused rights group of misrepresenting the facts and favoring the ""terrorist groups"" it says are behind the violence in Syria. Human Rights Watch points out that the obligation to minimize harm to civilians applies to all parties to a conflict and that the rebels are not blameless. ""The Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other Syrian armed opposition groups did not take all feasible measures to avoid deploying forces and structures such as headquarters in or near densely populated areas,"" the report said. Opinion: Syrian rebel group's dangerous tie to al Qaeda . Rebels say they downed helicopter . Meanwhile, a YouTube video posted by Syrian activists Thursday claimed that rebel fighters had shot down a Syrian military helicopter, killing four crew members on board. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group, said rebel fighters shot down the helicopter north of Maarat al-Numan. It was carrying food supplies to two regime bases, Wadi al-Deif and Al-Hamdiyeh, which have been under siege by the rebels for several months, the Observatory said. CNN could not independently verify the claim. The bases are strategically important to forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. If the rebels took them, it would enable their forces to cut off the single route in Idlib that the government uses to supply troops operating in Aleppo. The rebels already control the border crossings with Turkey in the north, so the government would be forced to use a more difficult route going from Latakia. Opinion: Before taking on Syria, U.S. should heed lesson of the past . In a Daraa city, opposition cites a massacre . Civilians were killed when Syrian forces used air cover to storm the city of Sanamein in Daraa province Wednesday, the opposition said. Daraa is where the anti-government uprising got going more than two years ago. The Local Coordination Committees in Syria called the act a massacre, saying at least 60 people were killed and al-Assad's government used civilians as shields to hold off rebels. More than 200 people were detained, homes were burned, and snipers targeted more than 10 civilian-filled cars fleeing to safety, the LCC said. The Syrian National Coalition, representing the anti-government fighters, said the action illustrated ""the lust of killing and thirst for blood in the hearts of those belonging to the criminal regime of Assad."" ""The criminals shelled the town (and) then they stormed it, allowing their loyalists to commit despicable atrocities against civilians. They took hostages as human shields. They also slaughtered people and committed vandalism and theft. These despicable acts against women, children and unarmed civilians indicate how the regime is incapable to confront the men of the revolution and the free Syrian army, as well as the failure to stop the liberation of Daraa province."" At least 149 people were killed across the country on Thursday, the LCC said. Read more: Syrian war is everybody's problem .

"Jackson, Mississippi (CNN) -- The family of an African-American man who died after allegedly being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck is asking state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty in the case. Relatives of James Craig Anderson, who died shortly after receiving his injuries on June 26, sent a letter with their request to the prosecutor in the case, Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith. ""We ask that you not seek the death penalty for anyone involved in James' murder,"" the letter states; the letter is signed by Barbara Anderson Young, James Craig Anderson's sister who is in charge of, and speaks for, his estate. The letter states that the family is opposed to the death penalty partly for religious convictions. ""Our opposition to the death penalty is deeply rooted in our religious faith, a faith that was central in James' life as well,"" the letter states. But the family goes on to explain that there is another reason for their opposition, one that is tied to Mississippi's racial past. ""We also oppose the death penalty because it historically has been used in Mississippi and the South primarily against people of color for killing whites,"" the letter states. ""Executing James' killers will not help to balance the scales. But sparing them may help to spark a dialogue that one day will lead to the elimination of capital punishment."" The family has been mostly private in its grief, but the letter sent to the DA's office alludes to what the family is going through. ""Those responsible for James' death not only ended the life of a talented and wonderful man. They also caused our family unspeakable pain and grief. But our loss will not be lessened by the state taking the life of another,"" it says. The death of James Craig Anderson, 48, occurred early June 26 in Jackson, allegedly at the hands of white teens who, after a night of partying and drinking, decided to go looking for black people to assault, law enforcement officials have said, quoting one of the suspects in the case. Anderson's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the actual killing, captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb. Smith, the district attorney, has called it ""vicious"" and a ""premeditated hate crime."" ""We have a racially motivated killing,"" said Smith, asserting that the group of white teens sought out a black person to kill. ""The teens came to Jackson and they picked out a black man, an innocent victim. They assaulted that victim, and then they just killed him."" U.S. Department of Justice investigators are now in Jackson, investigating the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors. The killing has also prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of nearly 540,000 people. Deryl Dedmon Jr., 19, of Brandon, Mississippi, is facing murder charges in Anderson's death and is eligible for the death penalty. A second teen, John Aaron Rice, 18, was initially charged with murder, but a judge reduced the charge to simple assault because Rice was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill Anderson. However, Hinds County prosecutors said they plan to seek indictments against both Dedmon and Rice for murder and a hate crime, and will seek indictments against other teens who were at the scene. Neither teen has entered a plea. The district attorney's office has not officially commented on the family's request for no death penalty in the case. Last week the Anderson family filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white teens alleged to have been present at the beating of Anderson that immediately preceded him being run over by the truck. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nationally recognized organization based in Montgomery, Alabama, that opposes racism and intolerance, joined in the lawsuit. ""James Anderson lost his life for no other reason than the color of his skin,"" said Morris Dees, chief trial counsel for the law center. ""Those responsible must be held accountable for their callous and deadly actions. We are filing this lawsuit today to ensure his family gets a measure of justice."" In addition to Dedmon and Rice, the lawsuit names five other teens as taking part in the incident that evening: Sarah Graves of Crystal Springs; Shelbie Richards of Pearl; and William Kirk Montgomery, John Blaylock and Dylan Butler, all of Brandon. None of the five has been arrested or charged, and it was unclear whether they had retained attorneys. Anderson, a line worker at a Nissan plant, sang in his church choir, the family's attorney, Winston J. Thompson III, told reporters. He leaves behind his partner of 17 years. ""He was just a pillar of the community,"" Thompson said. ""He paid his taxes on time, he went to work, came home -- he was just an average, ordinary citizen, good guy, wonderful gardener."" ""Anyone who knew James could see that he was a caring man with a beautiful smile,"" said Anderson's sister, Barbara Anderson Young, in a previous statement. ""He was such a compassionate person. We must take an honest look at the racial climate that motivated some young people to hurt such a wonderful person."" Attorneys for Dedmon and Rice have not responded to requests for comment from CNN. During a bond hearing, Dedmon's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the ""racial allegations."" A civil trial can proceed at the same time as a criminal case, but often the civil case is delayed pending the resolution of a criminal trial. While a criminal case is pending, a defendant in a civil case may need to invoke the Fifth Amendment. The lawsuit alleges all seven of the teens ""took part in what we call a joint venture, to seek out and do harm to a person of color,"" Thompson said. Authorities believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack, which took place after a night of drinking in largely white Rankin County outside Jackson. Dedmon told friends they should leave, saying, ""Let's go fuck with some niggers,"" officials said. The gang of teens climbed into Dedmon's green truck and a white SUV and drove 16 miles to the western edge of Jackson. They would have seen Anderson immediately as they exited the highway, officials said. He was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp. On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN, the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. The teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the teens yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground, although this is not visible on the tape. After the beating, some of the teens left and others got into the green Ford truck. At this moment, Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck. ""Defendant Dedmon drove the F-250 out of the parking lot and turned right onto Ellis Avenue,"" the lawsuit says. ""Just as Dedmon turned right, his headlights shone directly on Anderson, who, having been severely beaten, was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel's entrance. Dedmon accelerated, drove onto and over the street curb, and struck Anderson with the front of the F-250."" Shortly afterward, Dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing, according to statements some of the teens made to detectives. ""I ran that n----- over,"" he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the teens in the other car. ""He was not remorseful,"" District Attorney Smith said. ""He was laughing, laughing about the killing."" The proceedings of the case are taking place in the Hinds County courthouse, where in 1994 Byron de la Beckwith was convicted in the notorious killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963. That case and others have given Mississippi a racially charged history.","James Anderson's family opposes the death penalty for religious and historical reasons .

"(CNN) -- In a big swerve in policy, Google has decided to allow people to sign up using nicknames or other pseudonyms on its growing social network, Google+. This summer, Google took some flak for booting users who had used fake names on the 7-month-old site. Members of the tech community, who as early adopters had flocked to the search giant's Facebook alternative, argued that some people are better known on the internet by their assumed names. They also noted that people who used social media as part of social movements, such as those in Iran and Egypt, need to be able to conceal their identity for safety reasons. ""Today we're pleased to be launching features that will address and remedy the majority of these issues,"" Bradley Horowitz, a vice president for product development at Google, wrote Tuesday on his profile on the site. ""To be clear -- our work here isn't done, but I'm really pleased to be shipping a milestone on our journey."" Starting this week, users will be able to add a nickname alongside their real name, Horowitz said. An example? Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, he wrote. They will also be able to change their actual name to an assumed one. (One amusing example? Madonna). If Google flags a new name as inappropriate, users will be able to appeal and provide documentation, from a driver's license to appearances in media to ""proof of an established identity online with a meaningful following"" -- presumably something like a blog or Twitter account. The changes are Google's response to feedback after initial complaints, Horowitz said. But not everyone was pleased with the results. On The Next Web blog, writer Anna Helm complained that the new system would, by default, carry a user's Google+ name across all of its platforms, such as Gmail. So, someone who wanted to use a pseudonym there would, in effect, be announcing that name to anyone they send an e-mail to, whether they want to or not. (Gmail does have a ""send mail as"" field in its settings that lets users change how their name appears each time they send a message). ""We are many things to many people, and that's what most nicknames are about; we wouldn't necessarily want our parents to know how our friends call us, and vice-versa ... .,"" Helm wrote. ""One thing is for sure, this is a huge missed opportunity -- after all, didn't Google+ acknowledge early on that our social life revolves around different Circles? She clarified, however, that complaints don't negate high hopes for the site. ""Please wait a second before calling us 'trolls' or haters' -- if I and other people are pointing out these flaws, it's because we sincerely hope Google+ will become a great Facebook alternative,"" she wrote. In his post, Horowitz said that only a tiny percentage of Google+ users have issues with the names they submit. Only about 0.1 percent (one/tenth of one percent) submit name appeals, he said. Of those, about 60 percent simply want to add a nickname and 20 percent are businesses who accidentally tried to set up an account as an individual. The struggle isn't unique to Google, which last week announced that the site now has more than 90 million users. Facebook policy also requires users to register for the site with their real names. That site's terms and conditions state: ""We reserve the right to remove or reclaim [a user's name] if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name)."" The sheer size of Facebook (the site claims more than 800 million accounts) means it may take longer for fake accounts to be found, though.","Google+ will now allow pseudonyms, nicknames .

"(CNN) -- Beset by war and sectarian violence, Iraq has not had a lot to laugh about in recent years. But a trio of old friends from Baghdad have sought to change that, by distilling the jokey banter of their late-night drinking sessions into a controversial talk show. Hosted by Yasser Sami and Walid Monam, and produced by their friend Ghazwan Al-Shawi, the show is called ""Akou Fad Wahad"" -- ""There is this guy"" -- the typical setup for one of their anecdotes. The aim behind the production, says Al-Shawi, ""was to make people smile."" ""We wanted to do anything to make miserable and sad people happy,"" he said. But while it's proved a hit with their predominantly male audience, not everyone appreciates their sense of humor. Sami describes the first episode, broadcast in the summer of 2011, as ""very bold."" ""It got us into a lot of trouble because there was sexual and pornographic innuendos, so it was like a shock for all Iraqis,"" he laughs. Since then, the show has routinely offended the conservative sectors of Iraqi society with its discussion of taboo topics including relationships and sex. A religious group staged a demonstration outside the show's studio last year, and government censors complained about the content. Read more: Arab female film directors find acclaim . Sami said a gang even turned up at his house, threatening him. ""I can't tell you (who) because this means I will give them another chance to come to me again,"" he laughs. The jokes might not be considered particularly edgy to non-Iraqis -- or even necessarily that funny. A typical gag goes like this: ""A stoned guy bought two birds for his mother, one tweeting and the other silent. She asks, 'Son, why is it that only one of them that is tweeting?' 'Mother, the other one is the composer,' he replied."" But although the humor may seem mild, Iraq is not yet ready for ""Akou Wad Fahad."" Sami says the team has had to modify their approach in order to continue broadcasting. ""We changed things in the show,"" he said. ""We used to have a female DJ, but we were asked to remove her from the show, and we did."" Even in the new Iraq, said Monam, there are still many ""red lines"" that cannot be crossed in entertainment. ""Were it not for the limitations that are imposed on us, it would be a much better show. But we have to live with social taboos,"" he said. Challenging this, he says, is ""impossible,"" at least for now. But as frustrating as it might be, he and his friends are content to tone down their act, if it means bringing a smile to people's faces.","A trio of old friends from Baghdad have started a controversial talk show .

"(CNN) -- Google has started warning users when it thinks they may be targets of government-sponsored hackers, the Internet giant announced. Users whose accounts are compromised get a message at the top of their browser saying: ""Warning: We believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or computer."" Users in China have already begun getting the message, said one former journalist who used to work in Beijing. ""I got this warning three times,"" said Mei, who asked to be identified only by her first name for security reasons. Concerned that the warning itself was an attempt to hack her account, she posted a question in a closed Google group, asking if anyone else got the message. ""So far about 10 of us have received the same message, some in Chinese, some in English,"" she said. The group has about 200 members, she said. ""Some people are not even that surprised because they have suspicious followers on Twitter or Google,"" she said. But Mei said she was startled to find out she was apparently a target because she is not a journalist anymore. ""I left this industry about three years ago, in 2009, and left Beijing. I was really surprised that I was still a target,"" she said. Google did not accuse China of being behind the hacking, but the company has been at odds with Beijing in the past over Chinese attempts to control Internet use. Google declined to say how it could tell that governments were behind the hacking attempts. ""We can't go into the details without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors,"" Eric Grosse, Google security engineering vice president, said Tuesday in a post on the company's website. ""But our detailed analysis -- as well as victim reports -- strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are state-sponsored,"" he said. Getting the warning does not mean a user's account has been hacked, the company said, but that Google believes the account has been a target of phishing, malware or other hacking tools. Google advises users who get the message to strengthen passwords and update software. It also encourages users to be careful about where they enter their passwords.","NEW: Users in China are already getting alerts, one ex-journalist says .

"(CNN) -- Technology keeps bringing us closer to a world where people can communicate freely across language barriers. Google on Tuesday announced that its e-mail service, Gmail, soon will include an ""automatic translation"" feature for all users. ""The next time you receive a message in a language other than your own, just click on Translate message in the header at the top of the message,"" the company writes in a blog post, ""and it will be instantly translated into your language."" The update will roll out in the next few days. The announcement comes on the heels of another language-related news blip from the Mountain View, California, company. Google said last week that its Google Translate service -- which changes text from one language to another -- handles as much translation work in a day as human translators could manage in a year. ""In a given day we translate roughly as much text as you'd find in 1 million books,"" the company said. That is, of course, pretty incredible. But all of this translation talk is also generating discussion about the weaknesses of current computer-translation technology. Writing for The Atlantic, anthropologist Sarah Kendzior bemoans the fact that so many languages aren't represented by Google. ""Since its inception in 2006, Google has added 65 languages from areas extending across much of the world, though two exceptions stand out: Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,"" she writes. ""No languages from Central Asia -- such as Pashto, Usbek, and Uyghur -- make the Google cut. Neither do the African languages Hausa, Yoruba, or Zulu. The sole inclusions from sub-Saharan Africa are Swahili and Afrikaans."" Furthermore, accuracy is always a nagging and unavoidable topic of discussion when it comes to Internet translation services. Like many people, I use Google Translate as a starting point for translation, but don't necessarily trust that it will get everything right. It's great for getting the gist of a news story that's published in Japanese or Finnish, but if I need to write a formal letter to someone in one of those languages, I'd get human help. Google acknowledges as much on a Web page about Translate: . ""When Google Translate generates a translation, it looks for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents to help decide on the best translation for you. By detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators, Google Translate can make intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should be. ""This process of seeking patterns in large amounts of text is called 'statistical machine translation.' Since the translations are generated by machines, not all translation will be perfect. The more human-translated documents that Google Translate can analyze in a specific language, the better the translation quality will be. This is why translation accuracy will sometimes vary across languages."" As for its auto-translation e-mail service, Google says this will be a jump forward for an increasingly globalized workforce. And if you speak other languages fluently, you can notify Google so translations in those languages won't show up automatically. Google just ""graduated"" the feature from its Gmail Labs, a sort of sandbox for innovative features the company makes available to users on an a la carte basis. The change this week is that auto-translation now will automatically show up as a feature for everyone on Gmail. ""We heard immediately from Google Apps for Business users that this was a killer feature for working with local teams across the world,"" the company says. ""Some people just wanted to easily read newsletters from abroad. Another person wrote in telling us how he set up his mom's Gmail to translate everything into her native language, thus saving countless explanatory phone calls (he thanked us profusely). I continue to use it to participate in discussions with the global Google offices I often visit."" Here's how Franz Och, a distinguished research scientist at Google, sees the present state and future of machine translation online. He wrote this blurb on the sixth anniversary of Google Translate, which recently passed: . ""We imagine a future where anyone in the world can consume and share any information, no matter what language it's in, and no matter where it pops up. We already provide translation for Web pages on the fly as you browse in Chrome, text in mobile photos, YouTube video captions, and speech-to-speech 'conversation mode' on smartphones. We want to knock down the language barrier wherever it trips people up, and we can't wait to see what the next six years will bring.""","Gmail adds a feature that can translate emails between languages .
The update is rolling out in coming days .
Users can turn off the feature if they speak other languages ."
"(CNN) -- The United Nations is withdrawing international staffers from Syria for the time being after shelling near their living quarters, a spokesman said Monday. ""Yesterday and today, a number of mortar shells fell in close proximity to, and on the grounds of, the hotel in Damascus housing U.N. staff,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said. ""The mortar fire caused some damage to the building and some cars, including one U.N. vehicle. The United Nations Security Management Team has assessed the situation and decided to temporarily reduce the presence of international staff in Damascus due to security conditions."" Nesirky said the agency is ""temporarily relocating some of the U.N. international staff in Syria out of the country."" A U.N. diplomat who declined to be identified because he hadn't been authorized to speak on the matter said the number is half of its roughly 100 international staff members. Most of the Damascus-based staff of the Office of the Joint Representative for Syria are being relocated to Beirut and the Joint Special Representative's main office in Cairo. The national staff has been asked to work from home for now. ""These measures are being undertaken solely for security reasons. The United Nations remains active and committed to helping the Syrian sides in their search for a political solution,"" Nesirky said. ""The U.N. will maintain inside Syria the number of staff and capacity required to continue running its critical humanitarian programs and deliver assistance to civilians in need. This is a priority for the U.N."" The move comes amid alarm about the presence of chemical weaponry in the country and the wounding of a top rebel. Also, at least 48 people died in the civil war Monday, including 25 people in Damascus and its suburbs, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Report: Syrian officials claim chlorine, saline mix used in Aleppo attack . Top rebel injured . Free Syrian Army head Col. Riad al-Asaad, who is not related to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was injured Sunday during a visit to the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, FSA spokesman Louay Almokdad said. He is in stable condition after a blast targeted his car, the rebel group's spokesman said. The spokesman said al-Asaad is recovering from a foot injury in Turkey, but declined to confirm reports that his foot was amputated. No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. The attack took place four days after a video posted on YouTube showed al-Asaad defending the controversial al-Nusra Front and slamming the main opposition umbrella group. The United States has designated the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda, but some rebels say they don't have a problem fighting alongside them against Bashar al-Assad's forces. ""Nusra Front (fighters) are our brothers. They are 90% Syrians and the rest may be from other Muslim countries,"" the rebel leader said in the video. ""They haven't mistreated anyone in any way. We may have our own differences with them, but we respect them. Their mission is to serve the nation and the faith."" ""We hope that the other countries reconsider their policies toward Syria and understand that there is no need to worry about the rise of terror in Syria,"" he added. ""The Syrians have the right to fight for their freedom because they are oppressed."" Al-Asaad also slammed the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the main opposition alliance whose leadership largely consists of expatriates. ""The regime keeps killing our innocent civilians while the (National Coalition) is staying in fancy hotels, begging the world for financial support,"" al-Asaad said. ""We made a big mistake when we allowed the politicians to take over and divide our ranks. They worry about cutting the cake before we even win. I hope the Syrian National Coalition wakes up and figures out what they are doing."" Syria at the Arab League . Moaz al-Khatib, the Syrian opposition leader, will be addressing the Arab League summit in Qatar this week ""on behalf of the Syrian people,"" he said on the opposition Syrian National Coalition's Facebook page. Al-Khatib tried to resign Sunday, but the National Coalition's executive committee rejected the move. He will remain as coalition chief until the group's next general meeting, Sanir Ahmed, a coalition spokesman, told CNN. The speech, to be delivered in Doha when the league meets Tuesday and Wednesday, ""has nothing to do with the resignation,"" al-Khatib said. The Bashar al-Assad government's membership in the league has been suspended. The league, which represents the nations in the Middle East and North Africa, has granted the coalition Syria's seat. ""This decision represents an important asset for the Syrian revolution, and a major step on the road to achieve to its goals,"" the coalition said on its website. In announcing his resignation, al-Khatib accused world powers of using the Syrian crisis to advance their own interests. He wanted to step down, he said, ""so I could work with more freedom unavailable to me within the official position of the organization."" Last week, a Syrian opposition alliance elected Ghassan Hitto, who has studied and lived in the United States, to be prime minister of the opposition's interim government. Al-Khatib and Hitto were part of a delegation heading to the league summit in Doha on Monday.

"(CNN) -- At a time when Republicans are reaching out to the Hispanic community, why are some in my party treating the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico differently than the U.S. citizens in the 50 states? When the federal government pays close to 80% of Medicaid costs for states with similar populations, why are House Republicans cutting the federal share of Puerto Rico's Medicaid program to 20%? I believe leadership is about standing for what is right above politics and party, and that is the pledge I have made to the 3.7 million American citizens in Puerto Rico whom I represent. So I have to call it like it is: the U.S. House's anticipated move to exact a 65% cut to Medicaid funds for Puerto Rico is neither right nor fair, and I urge my Republican colleagues to change direction. As a fiscal conservative, I fully support efforts to responsibly reduce the cost and size of government, just as we have done in Puerto Rico by cutting government spending by almost 20% and reducing an inherited budget deficit by 90% in three years. However, it is fundamentally wrong to single out Puerto Rico to bear the brunt of cuts that are not shared by the rest of the nation, especially when the territory already does not have parity with the states in health care programs and lacks the votes in Congress to protect our position. Historically, Puerto Rico's Medicaid program has been chronically underfunded by the federal government. In 2010, Puerto Rico and the other territories secured corrective legislation to provide $6.3 billion in Medicaid funding over 10 years, which includes $5.4 billion for Puerto Rico. This legislation was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, although wholly separate from the law's other national Medicaid policy provisions. Where previously Washington paid less than 20% of Puerto Rico's Medicaid costs, the federal government is now paying 35% of the cost of our program. This is a step in the right direction, but still far below equal treatment. By comparison, the federal government pays nearly 70% for the District of Columbia's program and 75% for Mississippi's program. Now, House Republicans have assembled a package of budget cuts to replace the automatic, across-the-board sequester. The proposal does not cut the Medicaid expansion funds for the 50 states, but Puerto Rico's $5.4 billion Medicaid provision has been singled out for elimination. The cuts would knock Puerto Rico's federal Medicaid funding down to an effective rate of 20%. What governor in the 50 states could accept -- much less accommodate -- covering 80% of Medicaid costs? With federal mandates but no flexibility over eligibility or benefits? State budgets would be ravaged. The simple truth is that no governor in the 50 states would accept such an assault on American citizens. The state's delegation would fight it, and such unfair, pernicious cuts simply wouldn't be accepted. The same is happening in Puerto Rico, but we have no delegation, no seat at the table when decisions are made, no votes in the federal government that makes our laws. This is perhaps the ultimate price we pay because of our territorial status. If Puerto Rico were a state, we would have full parity in all federal programs, including Medicaid. Medicaid is not the only U.S. health care program in which Puerto Rico is treated unfairly. If hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have been willing to serve the U.S. military with honor, wearing the U.S. flag proudly on their uniform, then surely our veterans deserve to be protected under Tri-Care Prime, the gold standard of health care for our nation's veterans in the 50 states. Yet Puerto Rico's veterans are excluded. As I have said from the start of the health care debate, our goal is for the 3.7 million U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico to be treated equally with citizens residing in the states. The territory provision in the Affordable Care Act wasn't about individual mandates, or government-run healthcare. It was about beginning to correct the unfair treatment of the American citizens of Puerto Rico in Medicaid, which has existed since that program was established. My personal hero, Ronald Reagan, brought many of us from the Hispanic community into the Republican Party. Hispanics responded to him because he stood consistently and firmly for conservative values. The misguided proposal by House Republicans to cut Medicaid benefits for the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico compromises conservative values and jeopardizes our efforts to rally Hispanic support. It's not too late. House Republicans still have time to show real and genuine leadership on this issue. All we ask is that you treat Puerto Rico fairly. What's good for Americans in every state should be good for Americans in Puerto Rico as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Luis Fortuño.","Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuño: Some of my fellow Republicans being unfair to Puerto Rico .
He says the House GOP is seeking to cut Medicaid funding for the territory .

"(CNN) -- Searchers in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday looked for about 100 people still missing from a shipwreck that more than 200 people survived and in which nine are confirmed dead. The boat sank around 9:30 p.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) Friday along the Congo River near Maluku, which is part of the capital city of Kinshasa in the western part of the central African nation, according to a United Nations radio report. The vessel -- the MB Mobek, which was early into its route and was carrying several tons of merchandise -- went down after striking an obstacle. Maluku Mayor Papy Epiana told UN Radio on Sunday that authorities don't have a copy of the ship's manifest ""because we haven't seen the general or the commander."" But they believe about 100 people are missing, while more than 200 survived. ""We have recovered nine bodies since Friday,"" Epiana said.

"(CNN) -- The place where the Syrian uprising began two years ago, the Omari mosque in the city of Daraa, crumbled Saturday amid fighting between rebels and government forces. The minaret is shown toppling into a cloud of dust in a video posted on YouTube. The cameraman says government forces are the ones who brought it down, but his claim cannot be independently verified by CNN. Daraa was one of several places where rebels and government forces clashed on Saturday, according to activist groups. Throughout the past two years, the Omari mosque has been a gathering place for protesters, the center of anti-government demonstrations in the city. At the start of the uprising, it was briefly used as a civilian hospital for wounded protesters. The mosque was the first place protesters gathered in March 2011 to protest the arrest and alleged torture of teenagers who sprayed anti-Assad graffiti, sparking the waves of weekly peaceful demonstrations that eventually spread across the country. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group, said there was shelling using surface-to-surface missiles and phosphorus bombs in Daraa and other parts of the country. By the end of Saturday, 115 people were killed in Syria, including 12 in Daraa, the Local Coordination Committees said. Syrian activists tell CNN the government is using an increasing number of phosphorus bombs, incendiary weapons that can cause serious chemical burns. They are controversial but not banned by any treaty. ""Phosphorus burns on the skin are deep and painful,"" according to GlobalSecurity.org, a military research website. It says the burns are usually multiple and deep, down to the bone, and the particles will continue to burn unless deprived of oxygen. Activists reported an incident of phosphorus bombs in Merayiya, in Deir Ezzor province, on Friday. The Local Coordination Committees reported helicopters dropped phosphorus bombs over the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh in Daraa province Saturday. Video posted to YouTube on Friday is purported to show Merayiya. Thin streams of white smoke fall out of the clear sky onto pastoral farmland, where small fires then dot the landscape and create smoke that blankets the area. Another video on YouTube, posted Saturday, apparently of Khirbet Ghazaleh, shows a small fire burning in the bricks and rubble of a house, emanating heavy white smoke. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the videos. Phosphorus bombs often are used for smoke screens and become luminous in the dark, GlobalSecurity.org says. Human Rights Watch says incendiary weapons such as phosphorus bombs ""produce terrible scarring and disfigurement. The victims who survive endure painful treatments, suffer from psychological trauma and, in some cases, are ostracized by society."" Fighting raged Saturday in the Syrian capital of Damascus, a spokesman for the Abu Qtada Military Council told CNN. There were clashes at the gates of the city, in the Yarmouk refugee camp, and in the Damascus suburbs, where he reported artillery shelling by government troops. The Italian Foreign Ministry reported Saturday that four Italian journalists who were held hostage in Syria for more than a week were released. The Italian news agency ANSA reported the group was abducted in northern Syria on April 5. It said they were taken to Turkey after their release. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Neda Farshbaf, and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Omari mosque in Daraa was the first place protesters gathered in 2011 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Chinese newspaper at the center of a censorship storm hit newsstands in the capital Thursday for the first time since journalists went on strike in protest against apparent editorial interference from the government. However, the Southern Weekly was not widely available in southern Guangdong province, where it is published. The controversy surfaced last week when a group of former Southern Weekly journalists said, in an open letter, that a local propaganda chief had dramatically altered the paper's traditional New Year message, which had called for certain reforms and greater respect for constitutional rights. While newspapers in China are often subject to censorship, the journalists wrote in the letter that the changes, which included praise for the Communist Party, were excessive and took place after editors had signed off on the final proofs. Victor Li, a Chinese writer living in Beijing, told CNN China's new leadership would have taken a dim view of these calls by a newspaper known for pushing the boundaries. ""For these new bosses, what they do not need from Southern Weekly is that kind of advice! Just think about it, they have been waiting for this moment for a very long time and finally they are in charge. ""They believe they know what they should do and when to do it as well as how to do it. They do not want to be told what to do by a local newspaper!"" But soon enough, editors, reporters and their supporters protested on the Internet, on social media and in front of the office complex of the embattled media group. Protesters carried posters calling for press freedom. Some came with flowers to ""mourn the death of press freedom,"" while others wore facemasks to symbolize the gagging of the media. Even celebrities voiced their support via their micro-blogging accounts. Han Han, one of the most influential contemporary writers and bloggers in China, recently wrote on his blog post: ""The Southern Weekly has informed me a lot as a reader. It gives power to the weak and hope to the hopeless. So, in its moment of weakness and desperation, I hope we can all lend them some strength, even if just a little, and help it carry on."" Chinese actor Chen Kun tweeted: ""I am not that deep and don't play with words, I support the friends at Southern Weekly."" Others used more subtle language. ""Hoping for a spring in this harsh winter,"" posted Li Bingbing, an actress with some 19 million followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. Another actress Yao Chen, who has more than 31 million followers, used a quote from Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: ""One word of truth outweighs the whole world."" The street protests, although small in scale, posed a challenge to the Chinese leaders. Twenty or so years ago, the public would not have known of the controversy if the authorities had wished to cover it up. They could simply have arrested protesters as trouble makers and shut down the newspapers. Even if it were publicly known, it would have been difficult for the embattled journalists to secure public support. But with an estimated 400 million Internet users and some 200 million micro-bloggers, this protest gained traction. Some media reports suggest the authorities may have reached a compromise with the protesters -- an editor may be replaced, the Guangdong propaganda chief has been absolved of responsibility, the protesters will not be harassed, and the paper will not be shut down. Though this has still to be confirmed. Yet the fact an earlier commentary from the People's Daily, the communist party's official mouthpiece, was republished in Thursday's edition may support these reports. Tucked in a small corner of the paper, it says ""it's fundamental that the party regulates the press but its method of regulation needs to be advanced and must keep pace with the times.""","Southern Weekly was not widely available in Guangzhou where it is published .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- An affidavit of probable cause in Florida's case against George Zimmerman for the shooting death of an unarmed 17-year-old says that the neighborhood watch volunteer ""profiled"" the victim, Trayvon Martin, and disregarded a police dispatcher's request that he await the arrival of police. The affidavit, which was drawn up Wednesday but not made public until Thursday, was prepared by investigators for the state attorney, who charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder Wednesday. Public documents in the Trayvon Martin shooting . Zimmerman's relatives say that he did not profile Martin and that he shot him in self-defense. They say Zimmerman killed Martin after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk. One of the responding officers reported seeing a wound on the back of Zimmerman's head, and surveillance video appeared to show an injury. The affidavit offers little new about what happened on the night of February 26, when Martin was returning to the Sanford house where he was staying after having walked to a nearby convenience store, but it may offer some insight into how the special prosecutor views the case. ""Martin then walked back to and entered the gated community and was on his way back to the townhouse where he was living when he was profiled by George Zimmerman,"" the affidavit says. ""Martin was unarmed and was not committing a crime."" It says that Zimmerman, who lived in the same community, was in his vehicle when he saw Martin ""and assumed Martin was a criminal. Zimmerman felt Martin did not belong in the gated community and called the police. Zimmerman spoke to the dispatcher and asked for an officer to respond because Zimmerman perceived that Martin was acting suspicious. The police dispatcher informed Zimmerman that an officer was on the way and to wait for the officer. ""During the recorded call Zimmerman made reference to people he felt had committed and gotten away with break-ins in his neighborhood. Later while talking about Martin, Zimmerman stated 'these a**holes, they always get away,"" and also said 'these f****** punks.' "" As the incident was unfolding, Martin was on the phone with a friend, the affidavit says. ""The witness advised that Martin was scared because he was being followed through the complex by an unknown male and didn't know why. Martin attempted to run home but was followed by Zimmerman who didn't want the person he falsely assumed was going to commit a crime to get away before the police arrived. Zimmerman got out of his vehicle and followed Martin. When the police dispatcher realized Zimmerman was pursuing Martin, he instructed Zimmerman not to do that and that the responding officer would meet him. Zimmerman disregarded the police dispatcher and continued to follow Martin who was trying to return to his home. ""Zimmerman confronted Martin and a struggle ensued. Witnesses heard people arguing and what sounded like a struggle."" Calls to 911 captured a voice crying for help; that voice belonged to Martin, according to his mother; the neighborhood watch volunteer's relatives have said the voice was Zimmerman's. ""Zimmerman shot Martin in the chest. When police arrived Zimmerman admitted shooting Martin. Officers recovered a gun from a holster inside Zimmerman's waistband. A fired casing that was recovered at the scene was determined to have been fired from the firearm."" The affidavit says that an autopsy determined that Martin died of the gunshot wound. Asked Thursday why his client had followed Martin, Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara told CNN sister network HLN, ""I know so little about the evidence."" O'Mara, who began representing Zimmerman on Wednesday, said they had not yet discussed the facts of the case. Immediately after the shooting, Sanford police questioned Zimmerman and released him without charges. They said then that there were no grounds to disprove his account that he'd acted to protect himself. The affidavit was released the same day that Zimmerman made his first court appearance Thursday, wearing gray jail coveralls and saying little as his arraignment was set for May 29. Seminole County Judge Mark Herr, who spoke via a closed-circuit television connection during the four-minute hearing, said all matters including bond and further motions in the case will be handled by Circuit Court Judge Jessica Recksiedler. O'Mara did not ask that Zimmerman be released on bond, although he had said earlier that he wanted his client released as soon as possible. He added, however, that Zimmerman's safety could be jeopardized if he were released. ""I think nobody would deny the fact if George Zimmerman is walking down the street today, he would be at risk,"" he said. Zimmerman, 28, was in hiding until he turned himself in Wednesday after authorities said he would be charged in the case. Blog: Updates on charges and arrest as they unfolded . The case has triggered a nationwide debate about race in America and about Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows the use of deadly force in response to a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. O'Mara said Zimmerman, who will plead not guilty, is worried about getting a fair trial in Sanford -- where thousands had decried the police department's handling of the February 26 shooting. But O'Mara said he does not share those concerns. ""Florida has a very good process in place to make sure we get a fair and impartial jury,"" he told CNN. ""I trust that the system, the judge, the prosecutor and I will be able to, should the need arise, to get ourselves a fair and impartial jury to hear the case. It may not be in Seminole County."" Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, released a statement on Thursday seeking to clarify what she had said earlier on NBC's ""Today."" Earlier, Fulton had told NBC, ""I believe it was an accident. I believe that it just got out of control, and he couldn't turn the clock back."" In her subsequent statement, she said her comment had been ""mischaracterized."" ""When I referenced the word 'accident' today with regard to Trayvon's death, in no way did I mean the shooting was an accident. ""We believe that George Zimmerman stalked my son and murdered him in cold blood,"" Fulton said. ""The 'accident' I was referring to was the fact that George Zimmerman and my son ever crossed paths. It was an accidental encounter. If George Zimmerman hadn't gotten out of his vehicle, this entire incident would have been avoided. ""My son was profiled, followed and murdered by George Zimmerman, and there was nothing accidental about that,"" she said. Asked about Fulton's comments, O'Mara said, ""obviously, it was a horrible intersection of two young men's lives, and it ended in tragedy."" Share your views of the Trayvon Martin story . Zimmerman was charged 46 days after the shooting and after calls for ""Justice for Trayvon"" had grown more forceful, with Martin's supporters taking to the Internet and to streets in cities across the nation. Prosecutor Angela Corey said she will ensure that the judge or jury deciding the case will get only ""the relevant, admissible evidence on which they can then base their decisions."" ""Let me emphasize that we do not prosecute by pressure or petition,"" said Corey, who has a reputation for taking on tough, controversial cases in the three counties that make up the 4th Judicial Circuit. Trayvon Martin prosecutor lives up to 'tough on crime' mantra . A second-degree murder charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Natalie Jackson, an attorney for Martin's family, praised the prosecutor's decision. ""It's actually a very brave charge of Angela Corey and really shows that she conducted an independent, impartial and fair investigation in this case,"" the attorney said Thursday. ""She could have easily charged this as a manslaughter to try to appease everyone. She didn't."" Jurors will have several options under Florida law, including considering aggravating factors such as Martin's status as a child, Jackson said. Read charges against Zimmerman (PDF) O'Mara told reporters Thursday he has taken no fees from his client. ""He doesn't have any money,"" he said, adding the state may help defray the costs. Asked why he took the case, O'Mara told CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13, ""That's what I do."" O'Mara said Thursday he had spoken with his client by telephone several times Wednesday and met with him for about an hour Wednesday night. Read affidavit of probable cause (PDF) ""He is stressed,"" O'Mara said of his client. ""I'm just hoping that his mental health stays well and we can move forward with getting the case figured out."" O'Mara asked that there be no rush to judgment. ""Nobody, after all, wanted Trayvon Martin to be pre-judged as he was walking down that street,"" he said. ""I ask you not to pre-judge George Zimmerman, and please do not pre-judge the criminal justice system. It's going to work. We just need to let it work."" O'Mara told CNN on Thursday he expects it will be at least six months, and possibly a year, before the trial. Gov. Rick Scott, who appointed the special prosecutor on the case, issued a statement Wednesday calling on Florida's residents to ""allow our justice system to reach an appropriate conclusion in this case.""

"(CNN) -- Two tank barges loaded with light crude oil struck a bridge in the Mississippi River early Sunday morning. The Coast Guard said it was trying to determine how many gallons may have been spilled into the river near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The tank that was leaking contained 80,000 gallons of oil. A Coast Guard team has stopped the source of the spill, the agency said in a news release. The river is closed from mile marker 425 to 441. No one was injured in the accident, which happened at 1:30 a.m. The Mississippi River at Vicksburg moves about 890,000 cubic feet of water per second, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. If the vessel were to lose all its oil, that would be about 11,000 cubic feet. In February 2012 a tanker barge spilled 10,000 gallons of oil into the Mississippi after a collision near New Orleans. The Coast Guard drained the barge and towed it to a repair facility. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","Two barges strike bridge near Vicksburg, Mississippi, and one leaks oil .

"(CNN) -- A landlord wants the Ohio Civil Rights Commission on Thursday to reconsider its finding that she violated the law by posting a ""white only"" sign at her swimming pool. Jamie Hein has asked the commission to reverse its initial ruling that found she violated the Ohio Civil Rights Act by putting up a sign that read ""Public Swimming Pool, White Only"" at her Cincinnati duplex. The commission, meeting this week in Columbus, concluded last year that the sign ""restricts the social contact between Caucasians and African Americans as well as reinforcing discrimination actions that are aimed at oppressing all 'people of color.'"" The case was brought by Michael Gunn, a white man who said had unrestricted access to the pool area for himself and his guests during the nearly two years he lived in the duplex, he said in a December interview. Gunn, a software engineer, said he and his girlfriend, who is also white, lived upstairs; their 31-year-old landlord lived downstairs. However, he said their relationship soured in May 2011 when he invited his 10-year-old biracial daughter to visit and swim in the pool. ""Complainant states that the owner, Jamie Hein, accused his daughter of making the pool 'cloudy' because she used chemicals in her hair,"" the commission said in its summary. ""Days later, the owner posted a sign on the gate to the pool which read, 'Public Swimming Pool, White Only.'"" Hein said she received the sign from a friend and posted it in early May, the summary says. Several people interviewed by the commission staff confirmed that they had seen the sign, it added. Hein did not respond to a request for comment at the time. But she told ABC News in December that she collects antiques. She said the sign, which was dated 1931 and from Alabama, was a gift from a friend. ""I don't have any problem with race at all. It's a historical sign,"" she told ABC. Gunn said he was outraged by the sign and made arrangements to find another place to live as soon as he could. ""We were extremely upset and moved out on June 21, 2011, in order to not expose my daughter to the sign and the humiliation of the message,"" Gunn wrote in his complaint. He said he never confronted Hein about the matter, but has no doubt that the sign was intended for his daughter.","Jamie Hein is asking the state civil rights commission to reconsider its ruling .

"(CNN) -- Shouting condemnation and promises of retaliation, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah on Thursday condemned Israel's decision to send warplanes into Syria, calling its airstrike a day before ""inhuman"" and ""barbaric."" Russia also condemned Wednesday's attack, saying it would represent an unprovoked violation of United Nations charter if confirmed. Syria's Foreign Ministry summoned the commander of U.N. forces in the Golan Heights on Thursday to formally complain about the incident, while Iran's deputy foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, warned the attack would have ""dire consequences"" for Israel, according to Iran's semiofficial Mehr News Agency. Just last week, Abdollahian warned that Iran would consider any attack on Syria as an attack on itself, Mehr reported at the time. Meanwhile, a U.S. official said reports that Israel had struck a Syrian research facility were wrong, instead saying warplanes hit only one target: a convoy carrying surface-to-air missiles. A source said Wednesday that Israeli fighter jets had struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving Russian-made missile parts that could have been used to attack Israel. A senior U.S. official said the weapons were bound for the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria and Iran back the group, which the United States has designated as a terrorist organization. World leaders seeks $1.5 billion for afflicted Syrians . However, Syria's military said Wednesday and again Thursday in state-run media that Israel had struck at a defense research facility near the capital of Damascus, killing two workers and injuring five others. The report in Syrian state media tied the attack to Syria's ongoing rebellion, saying Israel struck the site after repeated attempts by what the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad refers to as terrorist groups failed to capture the facility. Experts say al-Assad's regime is faltering after nearly two years of fending off the persistent rebellion, and a former high-ranking Israeli Intelligence official said Hezbollah probably wants to take hold of all the weapons it can before that happens. Providing Hezbollah with Syrian arms would better equip it to attack Israel, the official said. In recent years, Syria has transferred to Hezbollah Scud missiles that can carry chemical weapons. U.S. authorities say they do not believe the strike was linked to growing concerns about Syria's chemical weapons, the senior U.S. official said Wednesday. The attack was not particularly surprising, said senior Brookings Institution fellow Michael O'Hanlon. ""At first glance, it likely won't be seen as a large escalation, though there's still a possibility for retaliation."" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to comment on the airstrike Wednesday. Carney referred questions to Israel, which also has been tight-lipped about the strike. Teen refugee: Prince Charming is dead . On Thursday, Syria took its case against Israel to Maj. Gen. Iqbal Singh Singha, the commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights, former Syrian territory seized by Israel in 1967. Foreign Ministry officials demanded a U.N. response to the incident, which it said violates the U.N. charter and the 1974 agreement between Syria and Israel negotiated after the Yom Kippur War. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office issued a statement Thursday expressing ""grave concern"" about the incident, but said U.N. officials lacked details about exactly what had happened. Russia, a Syrian ally, said it also had ""grave concern"" about Wednesday's airstrike. ""If the information is confirmed, we are dealing with unprovoked attacks on targets situated on the territory of a sovereign state that grossly violates the U.N. Charter and is unacceptable whatever motives are used to justify it,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday. Iran also backed its close ally. The semiofficial Iranian Student News Agency quoted Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi as saying the attack was ""in line with the West's policies of undermining the victories of the Syrian government."" Syria's ambassador to Lebanon, Ali Abdul Karim, said Syria reserves the right to a ""surprise retaliation"" against Israel, according to Hezbollah's official website, Moqawama. ""I cannot predict this, and this depends on the relevant authorities to decide on appropriate retaliation and decide the manner and place,"" Moqawama quoted him as saying. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: United Nations secretary-general expresses ""grave concern"" about airstrike .

"(CNN) -- A few days ago, controversy erupted when news broke that Google and other online advertising companies bypassed privacy protections in order to track users of Apple's Safari web browser and iOS mobile devices. This is not the first time, nor likely the last time, that Google finds itself in hot water for questionable behavior. At a time when many companies (notably Facebook) try to come up with ingenious ways to hoard personal data about consumers for lucrative ends -- undermining users' privacy along the way -- Google's actions reflect what is becoming the norm in this hypercompetitive space. Many compare tailored Internet advertising to the old small-town butcher, grocer and tailor. As relationships with these merchants developed over time, they learned about your preferences and were able to provide you with a higher level of service. But this is a broken analogy, for several reasons. I grew up in a small town, and guess what -- you have no privacy in a small town. It wasn't until I moved to a large city that I developed an appreciation for not being judged, spied upon and tracked by my community. When I moved to the city, I had a clean slate and something akin to true anonymity. Similarly, the companies tracking your every move on the Web don't stop tracking when you visit a new website, or even when you change Internet providers, computers or browsers. In the nondigital world, this would be like having the butcher, grocer and tailor follow you to your workplace, your home and your family vacation destination. They bring along their children and some of their friends -- not saying who, just people they know. This might result in the perfect cut of meat for your mood, a recommendation for spring vegetables that just came in, and some really awesome workout clothes for your new Pilates classes -- but I don't think any of us would really find this an acceptable tradeoff. Google knows too much about you . Google stopped using the offending technique after it was reported, although Microsoft is now reporting that Google is using a similar technique to bypass protections in Internet Explorer 9. Google said it had circumvented the protections against third-party cookies in Safari to allow Google+ users to click ""+1"" (instantly share) when they like an advertisement. That this technique allowed advertising tracking cookies to be placed as a result was just an accident. Google further defends itself by saying the trackers were not collecting personal information. They were simply checking whether you were logged in to Google and what your preferences were with regard to its advertising. The problem is that, as a result of this circumvention, Google's ad networks were also able to start tracking users -- an unintentional side effect, according to Google. Therein lies the problem. Google and other advertising networks chose to circumvent built-in privacy technologies that were designed to prevent the very thing they were trying to do. Google's own engineers recognized this as a security flaw in the browser code last summer and submitted a fix to the Webkit project. It is hard to understand how this mistake could have happened, considering the intense scrutiny Google's privacy policy has received in recent weeks. Clearly the testing of this code was either cursory or nonexistent. I choose to use Gmail, but that doesn't mean I expect Google to undo other privacy choices I've made in order to make social sharing more convenient. Google is heading in a direction that sounds a lot like Facebook's frictionless sharing, which automatically shares your activities on the Web through social apps -- and that's scary. The bottom line is that defining privacy using technical specifications will always lead to clever circumventions. Isn't it time to take a page from the laws meant to restrict our digital freedoms and use that broad language to instead write laws that defend our privacy? In the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act restricts our ability to break digital locks like copy protection and encryption. It is illegal to bypass a ""technological measure that effectively controls access to a work."" Basically, this means if the author of a protected work intended to protect it, you must have a darn good reason to break that protection. Shouldn't this be the way privacy works? If I take an action that indicates my intention to avoid being tracked, shouldn't you be required to honor it, even if you suppose it will diminish my ""experience"" with your products? Jonathan Mayer, the researcher who described how these cookies exploited the Safari bug, concluded his disclosure by calling privacy protections a ""cat and mouse game"" or ""arms race"" with advertising companies. Average Americans shouldn't have to stay one step ahead of advertisers by understanding the complexities of how cookies work and the intimate details of how they are used. Perhaps we should take a piece of advice from Howard Beale from the movie ""Network"": . ""I want you to get up right now, sit up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell -- 'I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!' Things have got to change. But first, you've gotta get mad!"" Privacy isn't dead, it's just being pulled out from under our feet. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"(CNN) -- After a technical hiccup, SpaceX's Dragon cargo capsule reached the International Space Station on Sunday. The unmanned Dragon is carrying more than 1,200 pounds of supplies for the crew and the crew's experiments. The station's robotic arm captured the Dragon at 5:31 a.m. ET, NASA said. The arm will guide the supply capsule into the station, and the Dragon completed the attachment at 8:56 a.m. ET, SpaceX said in a post on its Twitter account. The Dragon suffered a temporary glitch with its thrusters after it launched into orbit Friday from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shortly after the capsule separated from its rocket, SpaceX determined three of the capsule's four thruster pods -- which it would use to reach the station -- weren't operating. The problem appeared to be ""an issue with a propellant valve,"" SpaceX spokeswoman Christina Ra said. The company said the problem appeared to be fixed by Friday afternoon. ""Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green,"" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on Twitter Friday afternoon. The supply mission is SpaceX's second of a planned 12 under a contract with NASA. SpaceX became the first private company to deliver supplies to the station on NASA's behalf in October. NASA chose SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle and the Dragon spacecraft to resupply the space station in 2008. The space agency has retired its fleet of space shuttles and plans to turn much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","The International Space Station has captured the SpaceX's Dragon capsule .

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Benedict's butler has been arrested on suspicion of leaking confidential documents to an Italian journalist, the Vatican said Saturday. Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested Wednesday for illegal possession of confidential documents, found in his apartment in Vatican territory, the Vatican said in a statement issued three days later. Gabriele, who has worked as the papal butler since 2006, is one of only a handful of people with access to the pontiff's private desk. His job included handing out rosaries to dignitaries and riding in the front seat of the ""Popemobile,"" a vehicle used for public papal appearances, as seen in many photographs showing Gabriele with the pope. Last month, the Vatican gave Cardinal Julian Herranz a ""pontifical mandate"" to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents that have been released to Gianluigi Nuzzi, an Italian journalist and author of ""Sua Santita,"" a book that translates to ""His Holiness"" and includes the documents. Nuzzi would not confirm the identity of his sources, but he told CNN that his primary source -- who he referred to as ""Maria"" in his book -- ""risked life and limb"" if ever found out. The source worked inside the Vatican, according to Nuzzi, who refused to give other details such as the source's gender, age and if he or she was clergy or not. Nuzzi told CNN that he has not been questioned in connection with the arrest. The Vatican called the publication of his book ""criminal"" when it was released last Saturday in Italian. Feltrenelli and Mondadori booksellers both rank the book No. 1 in sales within Italy. Nuzzi's book highlights an internal power struggle within the Vatican through numerous documents including faxes, personal letters and inter-Vatican memos. He told CNN that he received the documents during a year of private meetings in secret locations. The documents show that the allegations of corruption and money laundering were a concern for a number of high ranking prelates, including Carlo Maria Vigano, who is now the Papal Nuncio in Washington, DC. Vigano wrote in a series of letters to the pope that he was concerned about the spread of corruption and that his move to Washington would stir speculation. ""Holy Father, my transfer at this time would provoke much disorientation and discouragement in those who have believed it was possible to clean up so many situations of corruption and abuse of power that have been rooted in the management of so many departments,"" according to his letter which was published in the book. The Vatican has not denied the authenticity of the documents, but instead says the breach of privacy is a criminal act. The 108-acre city-state has its own judicial system, distinct from the Italian judicial system. CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen pointed out that its courts normally prosecute the likes of pickpockets, ""not alleged moles."" Thus, the Vatican doesn't have facilities to incarcerate anyone on a long-term basis and the civil and criminal penalties it typically metes out are limited, Allen said Saturday. He speculated that, for these and other reasons, the Vatican may ask -- assuming that it determines there is enough evidence against Gabriele -- that any such trial occur within the Italian judicial system. ""The question then would become: Does the Italian government want to pick that (trial) up?"" said Allen, a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. ""In addition to being an embarrassing scandal for the Vatican on its own terms, this also has the potential to become ... a diplomatic contretemps."" For now, Gabriele is being held in a special cell within the Vatican City, a walled enclave within Rome, according to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi. Lombardi said the pope was ""saddened and shocked"" at the arrest. The Vatican said the first phase of its preliminary investigation, under chief prosecutor Nicola Picardi, had now ended. An investigating judge, Piero Antonio Bonnet, is leading the next stage of the investigation, which could lead to a trial or acquittal. Gabriele has appointed two lawyers of his choice to act at the Vatican Tribunal, and has had a chance to meet them, the Vatican statement said. ""He enjoys all the legal guarantees provided by the criminal code and criminal procedure in force in the State of Vatican City,"" it added.","NEW: Given its limited judicial system, the Vatican may ask Italy to handle the case .

"(CNN) -- The news of Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati's resignation spurred fierce weekend clashes in his hometown, the coastal city of Tripoli. Residents lobbed rockets and fired bullets at one another Saturday, leaving at least three people wounded, state news agency NNA reported. The city is home to both Alawite and Sunni Muslims, and sectarian tensions have worsened in recent months as the civil war in neighboring Syria rages on. The Alawites support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Sunnis want his ouster. The Lebanese government has remained officially neutral in the conflict -- even as it has firmly, but quietly, supported al-Assad. And Mikati, while a Sunni, led that effort. His departure, therefore, comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon. Analysts say the longer the Syrian conflict rages, the more destabilized Lebanon will become. Deadlock prompts resignation . Mikati announced the resignation of his government Friday after he said he could not negotiate a breakthrough on two fronts: . -- Preparations for the country's June parliamentary elections . -- Extending the term of the head of Lebanon's internal security forces. The group to blame in both cases is Hezbollah, a powerful Shiite political party that has links with the al-Assad government and dominates Lebanon's government. In the case of election preparations, lawmakers have been unable to come to an agreement on an election law. In the second instance, Hezbollah distrusts Maj. Gen. Ashraf Rifi, the security forces head. Rifi, like Mikati, is a Sunni. ""The prime minister cannot work in such conditions. He needs to respect the constitution,"" his spokesman, Fares Gemayyel, said. Complicated politics . Politics in Lebanon is complicated as it constantly struggles to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects. By law, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, the parliamentary speaker a Shiite, and the president a Christian. Mikati became prime minister two years ago, after Hezbollah brought down the previous unity government. Since then, he has maintained a balance between pro- and anti-al-Assad factions. His government, says Middle East expert Chris Phillips, was more interested in keeping Lebanon from getting dragged into the conflict. But in recent months, he has been at odds with Hezbollah. And the latest issues brought the tension to the surface. The Syrian connection . The major concern for Lebanon is that Syria's troubles will reopen the wounds of Lebanon's 15-year-long civil war, which ended in 1990. Aside from its southern border with Israel, Lebanon is entirely surrounded by Syria, and was considered part of ""greater Syria"" until the end of World War I. It became an independent country in 1943 but has been strongly influenced by Syria both politically and militarily for much of the time since. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop Lebanon's long civil war -- but maintained a significant presence long after the fighting stopped in 1990. This all changed in 2005 after former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed by a car bomb in Beirut. Anti-al-Assad elements in Lebanon accused the Syrian government of being behind the attack, and popular protests -- along with international pressure -- forced the Syrian military to withdraw from the country. Since then, Lebanon's two most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided in their attitude toward Syria: the ruling pro-Syria alliance led by Mikati and a group of anti-Syrian factions led by Saad Hariri, son of the assassinated former prime minister. In addition, thousands of refugees have poured into Lebanon since the conflict in Syria began. Costly uncertainty . In this climate, any instability in Lebanese politics can only exacerbate the spillover from the Syrian war. ""Now it is important for dialogue to begin for a salvation government to be established during this difficult period,"" Mikati tweeted after submitting his resignation. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also called on cooler heads to prevail. ""At this challenging time for the region, the secretary-general calls on all the parties in Lebanon to remain united behind the leadership of President (Michel) Sleiman,"" a statement from his office said. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","His departure comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon .

"(CNN) -- The French Senate voted late Monday to criminalize any public denial of what new legislation calls the Ottoman Empire's genocide of Armenians, triggering fresh condemnation from modern Turkey. Relations between France and Turkey have already deteriorated since the National Assembly -- the lower house of the French parliament -- voted to approve the bill in December. The Turkish government called Monday's vote ""an example of irresponsibility"" and vowed to ""express our reaction against it in every platform."" It is already illegal in France to deny the Holocaust of World War II, a crime punishable by a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ($58,500). The same punishment would be used under the Armenian legislation. Monday night's 127-86 vote sends the legislation to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has indicated he would sign it. Armenia's government hailed the vote, saying France ""reaffirmed its pivotal role as a genuine defender of universal human values."" But Turkey, one of France's NATO allies, called it ""an entirely unfortunate step for French politics."" ""Politicization of the understanding of justice and history through other people's past and damaging freedom of expression in a tactless manner are first and foremost a loss for France,"" it in a statement on the vote. ""It is obvious that the interpretation of historical events cannot be determined by the attitude of French politicians who see in themselves the right to judge other nations on the basis of one-sided views and declare a judgment on a serious allegation of crime such as genocide, thereby ignoring the principles of international law."" The statement added, ""Turkey is determined to take every step required against this unjust action, which disregards basic human values and public conscience."" The Turkish-Armenian controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist. Armenian groups and many scholars argue that Turks committed genocide starting in 1915, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, saying hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Turkish Muslims died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. Before the vote, Sen. Herve Marseille, one of the bill's supporters, argued that since France already recognizes the Ottoman-era killings as genocide, the same standard that applies to Holocaust denial should apply to the Armenian case. ""When we contest the Jewish genocide, we can be punished,"" Marseille said. ""And up until now, when we contest the Armenian genocide, there is no punishment. So we can't have a legal punishment for one and not for the other. Everyone is equal in front of the law."" But Sen. Jacques MÃ©zard, who opposed the legislation, said freedom of expression was at stake. ""It calls into question historical and scientific research. Tomorrow will there be a question of a VendÃ©e genocide?"" he asked, referring to a revolt against the French revolutionary government in 1793. ""Will we put the Spanish and the United States in the stocks for the massacre of Native Americans? We must reject this text and consign it to history books."" After December's vote in the National Assembly, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused France of committing its own ""genocide"" during its war against Algerian independence in the 1950s and 1960s. Erdogan announced that Turkey was reviewing its ties with France. Ankara recalled its ambassador to Paris for consultations, canceled bilateral visits and wouldn't cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union. The French Foreign Ministry shot back at Erdogan's comments, saying France ""assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history."" And Sarkozy has said that his country doesn't need an OK from another nation to develop its policies. In addition to being NATO allies, Turkey and France have trade ties valued at $13.5 billion, according to Turkish statistics. The genocide debate is also a source of tension between Turkey and the United States, another NATO ally. The White House, for example, annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution that would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide.","NEW: Turkey calls the vote ""first and foremost a loss for France""

"(CNN) -- A piece of space debris left over from a 2007 Chinese missile test collided with a Russian satellite earlier this year, rendering the satellite unusable, a researcher said Saturday. The collision appears to have happened January 22. That's when it's thought a piece of the Feng Yun 1C weather satellite, which was destroyed in the 2007 missile test, accidentally hit the Russian satellite, said T.S. Kelso, a senior research astrodynamicist at the Center for Space Standards & Innovation. The collision changed the orientation and orbit of the Russian satellite, which was being used in scientific experiments, Kelso said. It may have also damaged it. ""There has been a piece of debris catalogued by U.S. Strategic Command as a result of that collision,"" Kelso said. ""That would suggest that at least a part of the satellite broke off because of the collision."" It was February 4 when two scientists with the Institute for Precision Instrument Engineering in Moscow noticed a change in the orbit of the satellite, known as BLITS, Kelso said. The scientists estimated the change happened January 22. They contacted Kelso because CSSI operates a service that looks for close satellite approaches, he said. CSSI looked for objects that may have had a nearby approach with the BLITS satellite around the time of the collision. The Chinese debris was the only object they found. Although the predicted distance between the debris and the satellite seemed to preclude a collision, the fact that the close approach happened within 10 seconds of the change in orbit made the Feng Yun 1C debris the likely culprit, Kelso wrote in a blog post. CSSI is now working with the Russian scientists to find out more about the collision. BLITS is a small glass sphere that reflected laser beams for research. Because of the collision, the satellite now faces the wrong way and can't be used, Kelso said. The collision also sped up the satellite's spin period from 5.6 seconds to 2.1 seconds, Kelso said. China launched the Feng Yun 1C polar orbit weather satellite in 1999. It was destroyed in 2007 when China targeted it for a test of a ground-based, medium-range ballistic missile. U.S. tracking sensors determined the missile collision created hundreds of pieces of space debris, according to a U.S. official at the time. The test prompted formal protests from the United States and several U.S. allies including Canada and Australia. The problem of collisions involving space debris is not a new one. ""Collisions happen all the time, everywhere. Big collisions -- now those are the rare ones,"" said space debris expert William Schonberg, chairman of the Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering Department at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. The last major space debris collision was in 2009 between Iridium 33, an operational U.S. communications satellite, and Cosmos 2251, a decommissioned Russian satellite, Kelso said. Scientists know of only a handful of such collisions, but that's only because they happened with objects that were being monitored. Kelso and Schonberg say it's likely there are other ""junk to junk"" collisions involving unmonitored objects that no one knows about. In the case of the Russian satellite in January, ""it would have been very difficult to tell there had been a collision if it hadn't been for the fact that somebody was operating the satellite and noticed a collision,"" said Kelso. Experts and leading government agencies have been working on the space junk problem for decades, but it's a tricky one to solve, Schonberg told CNN. Trying to catch or deflect debris runs the risk of making the problem worse, he said. The debris could shatter into more pieces or change orbit and be on a collision course with something else. Some soft-impact lasers can nudge objects into a calculated orbit toward Earth so they will be pulled down and burn up in the atmosphere, Schonberg said. But scientists must make sure that happens over an ocean to minimize danger to people. ""Our technology has not caught up with our desire to clean up our mess"" in space, Schonberg said. ""If nothing else,"" said Kelso, this collision ""was a bit of a reminder that it will likely happen again, and maybe we should get back to work trying to figure out what to do about it.""

"(CNN) -- If you've got a question about buying a camera, shooting out a quick note to the retailer on Facebook might help. But if you're in the market for a silky camisole? Maybe not. That's according to a survey of 20 top online retailers on Facebook that suggests their level of responsiveness to customers is uneven, at best. One out of four companies failed to respond to a customer-service question posted on their Facebook wall, and even fewer replied to questions asked as comments on their posts, reported STELLAService, a company that rates customer service among online businesses. The results of the survey of 20 leading retailers, conducted on February 29, come at a time when almost every company that deals with the public is trying to tap into the more than 850 million people who use the social-networking site. ""Brands are doing an enthusiastic job of bringing people to their pages,"" said Jordy Leiser, STELLAService's co-founder. ""[But] I don't think they're also necessarily bringing with them a desire to be social. It's just turning into a marketing message for many companies."" Leading the pack was B&H Photo. The New York City-based outlet, which claims to be the largest nonchain camera store in the world, responded to its wall post in about two minutes, according to the report, which was shared with CNN Tech. Bed Bath & Beyond, Williams Sonoma, Sur La Table and Footlocker all responded to posts within 30 minutes. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Victoria's Secret, your best bet for the aforementioned camisole, was one of five companies that didn't respond to a wall post within two days. One Kings Lane, Radio Shack, J. Crew and Rue La La were the others. ""Retailers need to realize that two days in Facebook time is like two years in real time,"" Leiser said. ""Customer questions on Facebook should be granted the same urgency as a phone call."" Leiser noted, however, that the survey wasn't meant to embarrass companies or suggest that some of them don't care about their customers. Instead, he said, it was an effort to start setting expectations for an area of marketing and customer service that remains relatively unexplored. ""I don't think we as customers really know what to expect yet if you post a message,"" he said. ""Do you expect them to get back in 10 minutes or two hours? Or, a day -- is that alright? We're trying to develop the standard, or at least identify what the averages are for certain categories."" Among the companies that responded to questions during the survey, the average was under an hour, he said. The posts were what Leiser called generic product questions: ""Do you guys have this in a particular color I don't see? What's the return policy for this particular item ... ? That looks really cool, do you have this in whatever size?"" While 25% of retailers didn't respond to wall posts, that number rocketed to 65 percent for comments on other posts. Eight companies deleted the questions that were posted on their walls, whether they answered the question or not. Five companies out of 20 -- B&H Photo, Gap, Bed Bath & Beyond, JackThreads.com and Williams-Sonoma -- responded to wall posts and comments and had not deleted those questions within 48 hours. Only six of the 20 companies listed on their Facebook pages an e-mail address or phone number by which customers could contact them, the report showed. ""You can't just be there halfway with marketing,"" Leiser said. ""If you're going to be part of the community, be part of the community.""","Survey: One out of four retailers ignored customer questions posted on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Chris Froome conquered Mont Ventoux at the Tour de France to extend his overall lead with a week remaining in cycling's most prestigious race. In a fascinating battle Sunday, Team Sky's Froome caught and then passed Nairo Quintana during the steep 13-mile climb to give him a four-minute cushion over his nearest rivals. A spent Froome had to be given oxygen when the 15th stage -- the longest of this year's Tour at 150 miles -- ended but he'll get a chance to recover during Monday's day off. On Bastille Day French hopes were dashed, as Sylvain Chavanel lost his lead to Movistar's Quintana before the Colombian faded and Froome charged. ""I thought he'd be less strong than he was,"" Quintana told the Tour's website. Froome has now won both stages with summit finishes. ""I didn't expect to win,"" Britain's Froome said after nearly six hours of racing. ""I wanted to get more of a buffer on the general classification but I didn't think I could go for the win. ""Quintana is a very strong climber and I wasn't expecting him to go from as far as he did but hats off to him. He did a great ride and he showed how strong he is."" Despite the gruelling end to the stage, Froome and Quintana -- one to watch for the future -- had time for a quick chat. ""In the last (1.2 miles) he was fading a little and I still had a little bit left,"" said Froome. ""I was just trying to say, 'Man, come on just a little bit more, we're almost there.' But he was slipping behind. ""Near the end I don't think that I attacked. It was just that he couldn't ride on my wheel anymore and a gap opened up."" On Friday, Froome saw his lead cut to under three minutes by Belkin's Bauke Mollema and Saxo-Tinkoff's Alberto Contador. After Sunday, though, he leads Mollema by four minutes, 14 seconds and two-time winner Contador by 4:25.","Chris Froome wins the 15th stage of the Tour de France in a summit finish .

"(CNN) -- The top government lawyers from three dozen states sent a letter to Google on Wednesday, expressing ""strong concerns"" with the privacy policy the Web giant intends to roll out soon. ""On a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one Google product with all Google products,"" reads the letter sent to Google CEO Larry Page and signed by 36 state attorneys general. Last month, Google announced the new policy, which spells out how the company will collect and compile information to create a profile of users based on their activity across all of its various sites and tools. That includes Google search, Gmail, the Google+ social site and phones running its Android operating system. Privacy advocates objected to the policy -- which is set to go into effect March 1. Eight members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, wrote their own letter to Page, asking for clarification about the changes. In Wednesday's letter, the state attorneys called the policy ""troubling for a number of reasons,"" saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others. ""Consumers have diverse interests and concerns, and may want the information in their Web History to be kept separate from the information they exchange via Gmail,"" they said. ""Likewise, consumers may be comfortable with Google knowing their Search queries but not with it knowing their whereabouts, yet the new privacy policy appears to give them no choice in the matter, further invading their privacy."" Google said Wednesday it's willing to discuss the policy with government officials, but that its intention is to make using its products easier and more transparent. ""Our updated Privacy Policy will make our privacy practices easier to understand, and it reflects our desire to create a seamless experience for our signed-in users,"" a Google spokesman said in a written statement. ""We've undertaken the most extensive notification effort in Google's history, and we're continuing to offer choice and control over how people use our services services. Of course we are happy to discuss this approach with regulators globally."" In a blog post when the policy was announced, Google's Betsy Masiello noted that many of Google's products, including YouTube and search, don't require users to be signed in to use them. Other tools allow for ""incognito"" modes and there are other privacy tools that can be used, she said. A later post from Google Public Policy Director Pablo Chavez said that the company's privacy policies, but not its privacy controls, are changing. They are ""trying to make them simpler and more understandable, which is something that lawmakers and regulators have asked technology companies to do,"" he wrote. ""By folding more than 60 product-specific privacy policies into our main Google one, we're explaining our privacy commitments to users of those products in 85% fewer words."" That wasn't enough for the attorneys general. They singled out users of Android phones, which make up about 50% of the U.S. smartphone market, saying they won't be able to ""opt out"" without buying a new phone. ""No doubt many of these consumers bought an Android-powered phone in reliance on Google's existing privacy policy, which touted to these consumers that 'We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent,' "" the letter said. ""That promise appears not to be honored by the new privacy policy."" The letter asks Google to meet with representatives of the attorneys general before the policy goes into effect ""to work toward a solution that will best protect the privacy needs of those who use Google's products.""","Attorneys general from 36 states object to Google privacy changes .
They say policy ""appears to invade consumer privacy""

"(CNN) -- England's 10-wicket hero and man-of-the-match James Anderson admitted to total exhaustion after his side held off a gritty Australian fight back to win an extraordinary first Ashes Test by 14 runs. ""It has been draining emotionally and physically,"" said Anderson. ""I'm lost for words - it's been amazing."" But the first Test also threw up questions about the use of technology in sport, with Australia ruing the Decision Review System (DRS) that appeared to weigh heavily against the Baggy Greens. CNN looks at five things we learned from the first Test at Trent Bridge. Technology equals controversy . Unlike football, which has grappled with the issue of technological assistance for its embattled referees for years, cricket has long been comfortable with a little high tech help for its umpires. DRS has been around in cricket since 2009; while not without its dissenters, by and large it has brought clarity and dampened down controversy in big games. Not in this match though. As the old bumper sticker says, ""to err is human; to foul things up completely requires a computer,"" except here the human element was solely to blame. From umpire Aleem Dar's failure to pick up Stuart Broad's clear edge to Australia's wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, to a dozy 'hot-spot' camera operator who was still reviewing the previous ball as England appealed Jonathan Trott's dismissal, this was an error-strewn performance by both the on and off-field umpiring team. The look on Australian captain Michael Clarke's face when he realized his profligate use of appeals had left him without recourse to the third umpire as Broad stood his ground summed up the frustration around DRS. Broad's decision not to walk was huge in itself, and prompted an impassioned debate that will linger for some time -- some argued that he was a disgrace, others that he was simply being professional. Interestingly the people who seemed least bothered by it were the players, possibly because -- with very few exceptions -- no one in top-flight cricket walks any more. In the words of former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy, ""walk in an Ashes Test match? Only if the car runs out of petrol!"" Interestingly though, Broad didn't wait for the umpire's signal when he did eventually depart. Perhaps even he was a bit embarrassed. In the final analysis, much as was always argued when the umpires acted alone, the mistakes just about balanced themselves out. Certainly, the Australian captain could learn much from the approach of his opposite number Alastair Cook, who used his appeals wisely -- especially for the final decisive wicket. But the fact that technology's role was so central to so much controversy at Trent Bridge must be cause for concern. Anderson is a true great . While the great Australian side that dominated world cricket from the early 90s into the 21st century was full of stars, its bowling attack was arguably the key to its supremacy. Alongside the genius of spinner Shane Warne it was the metronomic precision and controlled aggression of fast bowler Glenn McGrath that kept the game's best batsmen in check. If the current Australian side is crying out for such a presence, England can rest easy in the knowledge that they have their own McGrath in Anderson. The Lancashire pace bowler has matured into an intimidating mix of cool exactitude and thoughtful endeavour. For over after over he pinned the Australian attack back, reining them in each time they threatened to break free and ensuring they could never relax. It was a performance, on a pretty lifeless pitch, that underlined why he can now justifiably be ranked among the greatest pace bowlers. His 10 wickets added to a career tally that should eventually see him overtake Ian Botham as England's highest wicket-taker. And his 10th wicket, albeit gained by the finest of margins and the faintest edge, may well be among those that come to define this Ashes series. Australia is here to win . Australia arrived in England as clear underdogs, before cementing this status with an implosion in the ICC Champions Trophy that indicated a team in disarray. If off field disciplinary issues and major changes in the coaching staff left many wondering what kind of shape this team would be in for the first Test, all agreed that -- on paper at least -- it had a long batting line-up. None, however, would have predicted just how long. Making his Test debut at just 19, there were few indications that Ashton Agar, taking the field with Australia on the brink of oblivion at 117 for 9, would deliver such a dazzling performance. But what a performance it was -- full of eye-catching stroke play and stylish shots that reached all parts of Trent Bridge, watched by a gaping crowd that became gradually more appreciative as the records tumbled. As the highest ever score by an Australian number 11 became the highest ever score by any number 11, McGrath remarked that he thought he'd been presenting Agar's Baggy Green cap to a bowler, not an all-rounder. As the debutant reached 98, it seemed the whole stadium, as well as most of those observing via Twitter, were willing him into triple figures. It wasn't to be, as an overly ambitious boundary attempt from the bowling of the Test's soon-to-be pantomime villain, Broad, was lofted into the hands of Graeme Swann; but the standing ovation he received was heartfelt. Yes, he possibly should have been given out earlier, and it wasn't quite enough to win the match for the Australians, but no one, English or Australian, will forget that innings. At the other end of the age scale, the veteran Haddin's performance on the final day was no less impressive, aided by James Pattinson he brought his team within a whisker of an implausible victory. England beware: this team has a whale of a tail and bowlers will need to be at their best to clear the Australian decks. The Ashes are still worth fighting for . The appeal of the Ashes comes in large part from the fearsome way in which the series is contested. When England finally reclaimed the tiny urn in 2005 it was a release so cathartic that it elevated the series to new heights in the UK; and made Australia all the more determined to reclaim the prize, which they did emphatically in 2007. However, recent contests have felt less competitive. As the Australians struggled to rebuild, and England became ever more proficient and professional, it felt as though this year's series might lack a little of the appeal of recent years. By Sunday at Trent Bridge, those fears had been dispelled so emphatically that the very idea of a lacklustre Ashes seemed laughable. This was, it was unanimously agreed, one of the best ever Ashes Tests, and quite possibly one of the best ever Test matches. New rivalries, fresh controversies and innumerable talking points conspired to ensure that the second Test will be the most hotly anticipated for years. The fact that much of the UK is currently basking in a heatwave only added to the sense of enjoyment from the home fans, but even in defeat the Australians could draw succour from the fact that their team can clearly make a decent fist of winning the series. Clarke's dignified speech as he congratulated England spoke of a man well aware he had been part of something special. And best of all, this is just the beginning of back-to-back series in 2013. Test cricket is still uniquely compelling . By the end of Wednesday those fans with tickets for Saturday's action were justifiably pondering other plans. Batsman after batsman failed to rein in his desire to play at every delivery, with wickets lost due primarily to poor decision making. Bowling, too, was erratic -- the Australians giving away 21 runs to the extras column. Even the idea that the match could be over before Friday was being seriously discussed, and inevitably that discussion turned to the format of Test cricket. Batsmen, it was agreed, were too used to the speed of Twenty20 and 50-over games; skills that fed a long innings, such as the ability to safely leave a ball, had been lost in the pressure to score quickly. Punters preferred the quick fix entertainment of shorter forms of the game and this was the result. As the Test entered the afternoon session on the fifth day, however, it became clear that this type of cricket still offers something unique. This was like choosing an Emmy award winning DVD box set over a summer sci-fi blockbuster. As the hours and days rolled by, nuance, sub-plots, character development and twists were revealed that would be impossible in the frenetic environment of limited overs cricket. Trent Bridge was by turns feather bed and cauldron for the protagonists as the game's story evolved; nails were shorn to their stumps, eyes raised plaintively to the heavens by players and fans alike, cries of anguish were matched by sighs of relief and gasps of wonderment, eyes squinted intently at the square throughout. This utterly enthralling contest was the perfect reminder of what Test cricket can offer.","England beat Australia in thrilling first Test at Trent Bridge .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- An al-Qaeda affiliate claimed responsibility Wednesday for a chain of 24 bombings and two gun attacks in Iraq a day earlier, as the death toll rose to 61. A statement attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq appeared on extremist websites, calling Tuesday's carnage ""retaliation"" against Shiite members in government. Though Iraq has grown safer in the last six years, sectarian violence and instability still grip the country 10 years after the start of the U.S.-led war. The attacks -- 17 car bombs, seven roadside bombs, and two shootings -- ripped mostly through Shiite neighborhoods of Baghdad, but also struck Sunni communities in other towns. At least 200 people were wounded. Early Wednesday another car bomb detonated on a busy square, killing two people and injuring five more. The level of carnage has dropped considerably since the height of the sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007 that nearly tore Iraq apart. But the continuing violence serves as a near daily reminder of the threat to the fragile political and economic gains in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. It's the second time in less than a week that the Iraqi capital has endured major simultaneous attacks. Interactive: Iraq 10 years on . Ten years on, the war left more than 134,000 Iraqis and more than 4,800 U.S. and other coalition service members dead. The war cost hundreds of billions of dollars. ""It remains entrenched and pervasive, with a clear beginning but no foreseeable end, and very much a part of the present in Iraq,"" said Iraq Body Count, a UK-based group that tracks war deaths. ""In major regions of the country armed violence continues to exact a remorseless toll on human life, young and old, male and female, across society."" In Tuesday's violence, car bombs rocked Baghdad neighborhoods long engulfed in conflict, like Shulaa and Kadhimiya. They struck Mustansiriya University in eastern Baghdad and the fortified International Zone, also known as the Green Zone, where the city's international presence is concentrated. They hit cities north and south of the capital as well. Authorities defused four car bombs in the southern city of Basra. Attackers also struck in the provinces of Anbar, Kirkuk, Babel, Nineva, and Diyala. They set off roadside bombs in Baghdad's teeming Shiite slum of Sadr City. Iraq is still on pins and needles . Change can be seen in the once war-torn nation. A robust form of democracy has taken hold. Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds and others often work together. There is more political, economic and social stability. Coalition forces that ousted Hussein's government have departed. However, recent attacks in Shiite areas have spread fear among Iraqis that sectarian warfare between Sunnis and Shiites may ravage the country again. Sunnis had more political clout during Hussein's reign. The Shiites and the Kurds, the other two main groups, were second-class citizens. Since Hussein was toppled, the tables have turned. Shiites -- the largest religious group in the country -- predominate in government. The Kurdish semiautonomous region in the north, and the Kurds themselves, have more clout. Today, Sunnis feel they've been politically marginalized. They demand that the Shiite-led government stop what they call negative treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Expert: Syria and Iraq connected . Ramzy Mardini, an expert on Iraq, said the attacks were probably ""prescheduled for the anniversary."" He also said the latest violence reflects the Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions raging next door in Syria. He believes such attacks illustrate the revival of the ""capability and confidence"" of al Qaeda in Iraq, buoyed by a Syrian uprising ""spearheaded by Sunni militancy."" It stands to reason that the attackers are targeting the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The Shiite-dominated government is helping neighboring Iran, the largest Shiite nation in the world and a supporter of the Alawite-dominated Syrian government. ""Al Qaeda in Iraq is becoming less exclusive to Iraq. They are trying to channel energy and piggyback off the Syrian revolution by aiming to merge Iraq and Syria into one theater of sectarian war,"" said Mardini, adjunct fellow at the Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies in Beirut, Lebanon. ""Given that Maliki is helping Iran prop up the Syrian regime, AQI is advertising their cause and looking to attract the support and resources of militant groups in Syria."" Obama administration marks the milestone . U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Chuck Hagel marked the 10th anniversary of the war's beginning with statements praising the service members who fought in Iraq. Obama honored the more than 1.5 million service members and civilians who served there and the memory of the nearly 4,500 Americans who died there. ""The last of our troops left Iraq with their heads held high in 2011, and the United States continues to work with our Iraqi partners to advance our shared interest in security and peace."" Obama said a strong Post-9/11 GI Bill would help veterans pursue jobs and education. ""We must ensure that the more than 30,000 Americans wounded in Iraq receive the care and benefits they deserve and that we continue to improve treatment for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder."" Hagel and Obama also praised the sacrifices of service members' families. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.","Islamic State of Iraq statement says the 61 deaths are 'retaliation'

"(CNN) -- He didn't win the 14th stage of the Tour de France but Chris Froome's Saturday at cycling's most prestigious race was better than his Friday. Although he still held the overall lead heading into Saturday, the Team Sky racer saw his advantage trimmed by both Bauke Mollema and two-time Tour winner Alberto Contador. Contador, considered Froome's main rival, made up more than a minute to pull to within three minutes. Froome, deprived of the services of injured teammate Edvald Boasson Hagen, was left behind the breakaway pack. In Saturday's 118-mile trek from Saint-Pourcain-sur-Sioule to Lyon, though, Froome came away unscathed as the main contenders enjoyed a fairly routine outing. Belkin's Mollema remains two minutes, 28 seconds behind Froome, with Saxo-Tinkoff's Contador staying 2:45 behind. There was no change in the top two of the points standings, either. Cannondale's Peter Sagan kept his lead of 84 points over Mark Cavendish. A ""really big test,"" as Froome put it, comes Sunday as the 15th stage is the longest of the Tour and concludes at the summit of Mont Ventoux. Riders face a steep 13-mile climb to reach the summit. ""It's an extremely historical climb in terms of cycling so there'll be a lot of guys going for it to try and win,"" Froome told the Tour's website. ""It's going to be quite a tactical game tomorrow in the early parts of the race but once we hit the mountain it's all about who has got the legs and that part of the race is quite straight forward."" Italy's Matteo Trentin made it two stage wins in a row for Omega Pharma-Quick Step when he came from behind to beat Switzerland's Michael Albasini by half a wheel in a sprint finish. Cavendish claimed his 25th stage victory overall on Friday. ""It's my first win as a pro,"" said Trentin. ""When you work alongside a rider like Cavendish, you learn a thing or two. I just waited patiently and unleashed my sprint with (110 yards) to go. ""We're all super happy. All my teammates came behind the podium to congratulate me and that was really nice."" Hopes of a first French stage winner this year were dashed when Julien Simon was caught near the end. ""It's infuriating to miss out on a stage win because we know that, for our team, the opportunities are rare,"" Sojasun's Simon said. ""Today we had one chance, and then in the Alps we are on terrain that is not favorable to us.""","A day after his lead was cut, Chris Froome maintained his two-minute advantage .

"(CNN) -- Google's infant social network experienced a recent growth spurt. Google+ has more than 90 million registered users, Google CEO Larry Page said during the company's earnings presentation on Thursday. That more than doubles the 40 million that Google reported in October. ""We're very excited about the growth we've had, and we've certainly seen a tremendous number of people added every day,"" Page said. ""That notion of identity is a deep part of what we're doing."" Google launched its social network last June. Since then, it has added toolbars and other buttons on its websites to aggressively promote the service. Google stirred up controversy last week when it began giving prominent placement to Google+ pages in results delivered by its search engine. On average, Google engineers have introduced a new feature related to Google+ every day since its launch, Page said. It took Facebook about four years to reach 90 million users, according to Facebook's public statements. After starting as a students-only service, Facebook now has 800 million people checking their accounts at least once a month, about 10 times that of Google+. Analysts say Google+ was built specifically to challenge Facebook's growing dominance on the Web. Google and Facebook generally do not collaborate. Another rival social network, Twitter, complained that the recent changes to Google search favor Google+ and harm Twitter's ranking on results pages. ""We provide a lot of third-party data in search, and we would love to have more,"" Page said in response to an analyst's question. ""Generally, companies have been walling that data off."" People who register for Google+ tend to be dedicated users of Google's search engine, e-mail and documents services. More than 60% of them use Google products every day, and 80% visit a Google site at least once a week, Page said. Page, who posted his comments on his Google+ page, did not say how often or what percentage of users specifically visit its social networking service. ""Engagement on Plus is also growing tremendously,"" Page said. A Google spokesman declined to comment.","Google says 60% of Google+ members visit its products every day .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan has announced a ban on polio vaccines for children as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, according to a statement by the Taliban. ""Polio drops will be banned in North Waziristan until the drones strikes are stopped,"" said the statement, released Saturday. ""Almost every resident of North Waziristan has become a mental patient because of the drone strikes, which are worse than polio,"" the statement continued. ""On one hand, the U.S. spends millions of dollars to eliminate polio, while on the other hand it kills hundreds with the help of its slave, Pakistan."" Pakistan remains one of only three countries that have yet to eradicate polio. Photos: Faces of the Taliban . The country's polio campaign made headlines last year when a Pakistani doctor was linked to a CIA operation to verify Osama bin Laden's whereabouts with a door-to-door vaccination campaign in the town of Abbottabad, where the al Qaeda leader was hiding before he was killed. U.S. officials have said the plan did not work, but aid groups and Pakistani health officials have said the CIA's alleged meddling with a vaccination campaign undermined Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio. Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur made the decision on the vaccination ban after consulting with other Taliban leaders, according to the statement. Bahadur commands the faction of the Taliban based in North Waziristan, the district Washington believes is the main safe haven for the Haqqani network and other militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. It's not clear how Bahadur's decree will impact the polio eradication campaign in North Waziristan or in nearby districts, where he doesn't wield as much power. It is widely believed that Bahadur is allied with the Haqqani network and provides shelter for the group in North Waziristan. The United States has pushed Pakistan to launch an offensive against the militant groups in North Waziristan, but Pakistani military officials have resisted, saying their troops are stretched too thin. In April, U.S. President Barack Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser John Brennan acknowledged the use of U.S. drones. ""Yes, in full accordance with the law -- and in order to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States and to save American lives -- the United States government conducts targeted strikes against specific al Qaeda terrorists, sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft, often referred to publicly as drones,"" Brennan said.

"Editor's note: CNN.com profiled Kyle Graddy last summer when he attended his first pro-baseball game during a peanut-free night in Birmingham, Alabama. Three million U.S. children suffer allergies to peanuts and other foods, which can cause anaphylaxis and -- if left untreated -- death. Last week, Graddy traveled to Washington to lobby for legislation that would create voluntary national guidelines on how schools deal with students with food allergies. Kyle Graddy, 9, lobbies Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, about pending food allergy legislation. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- My name is Kyle Graddy. I'm 9 years old and I have a peanut allergy. I traveled to Washington last week to help myself and other kids with food allergies to have a safer experience at school. I represented the state of Alabama in the Kids' Congress on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network. There were 80 kids and 73 families from 24 different states participating in the Kids' Congress. Kids with food allergies are just like any other kids, they just can't eat some foods because it could make them very sick. We want Congress to make a new law that would help us not to worry as much about our food allergies and stay safe. I think it is important for the kids with food allergies to speak with the senators and congressmen because we can tell them what it is like to live with the food allergies and how hard it can be to feel safe at school when there are no real guidelines for anyone to follow. This trip was my first visit to Washington. My whole family went with me on the trip.  Watch Kyle and his family on Capitol Hill » . On the first day of the Kids' Congress we rode a bus to the Capitol and had our picture made on the steps. They took a serious picture -- and a silly picture. Next, we all split up and went to meet with senators and congressmen from our states. I was kind of nervous because I have never talked with a senator or congressman before. The Russell Senate Building was very big and was across the street from the Capitol. The hallways were long and full of lots of offices. My first meeting was with Graham Smith of Sen. Richard Shelby's office. During our 10-minute meeting we sat at a big table in a conference room. I told her about my allergies and how hard it can be for kids at school with food allergies. Later, I saw Sen. John McCain's office and his assistant gave me an autographed picture of the senator. I also saw President Lyndon Johnson's old office. My second meeting was with Rep. Mike Rogers, who is from my home state. We all sat in chairs and talked for about 15 minutes during our meeting. Congressman Rogers had a big desk with Auburn University pictures and an Auburn University football helmet in his office. Rep. Rogers was very nice. He welcomed me to town and asked me about my food allergies. He also asked me about my EpiPen [the auto-injector]. I always wear it, so I showed it to him and told him how to use it. [Editor's note: allergy sufferers often carry emergency auto-injectors in case they come into contact with harmful foods and need a dose of lifesaving epinephrine.] . I talked with him about how hard it is sometimes to be at school with food allergies. The meeting went very well, because Congressman Rogers said that he would co-sponsor the food allergies bill. The bill would make voluntary national guidelines for schools to use in order to help keep kids with food allergies safe. The guidelines would make school much easier for teachers, school nurses, principals, parents and kids with food allergies. Moms and dads would not have to start over each new school year teaching the school teachers, principals, and nurses how to keep their children with food allergies safe in a new classroom. At the beginning of the school year, the school would know that a child has an allergy and would also know exactly what to do for the child to be safe. Also, when I change schools from elementary to middle school, the new school would be prepared for my food allergies. With national guidelines, I would also be safer at school if my family had to move to another state, because the guidelines would be the same. It was cool to meet other kids that have food allergies like me. I met one friend who is allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, milk and wheat. He is 11 years old. The next day I also met for about 5 minutes with people in Sen. Jeff Session's office. In between the meetings on Capitol Hill, I went sightseeing and ate lunch. They had very good pizza! Debby McBride of Congressman Rogers' office gave us a tour of the Capitol Building. The tour was so cool. I got to see the House and Senate Chambers and Sen. John McCain was there. At the Capital, I got to see the old Supreme Court. I also went through the Cannon Tunnel. During our trip we also saw a lot of the other great sites around Washington, including the White House. We got to go on a tour and we had to go through tight security. The tour was led by a Secret Service agent. I liked the painting of Abraham Lincoln that was hanging over the fireplace in the dining room. At the end of the tour, we walked out the front door of the White House. That was so cool! The Kids' Congress on Capitol Hill was exciting. I feel pretty good about it. I really liked Washington and can't wait to go back.","Nine-year-old boy joins other kids to lobby Congress for federal school guidelines .

"(CNN) -- A British newspaper waded into the argument between Britain and Argentina over sovereignty of the Falkland Islands on Friday, publishing an open letter in a Buenos Aires newspaper saying ""hands off"" the disputed territory. The Sun's letter, printed in the Buenos Aires Herald, was a riposte to an open letter published in the British press Thursday in which Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner called on the UK to hand back the islands, known in Argentina as Las Malvinas. What lies behind renewed tensions over the Falkland Islands? Her open letter, addressed to British Prime Minister David Cameron and copied to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, accused Britain of blatant colonialism. She wrote: ""The Argentines on the Islands were expelled by the Royal Navy and the United Kingdom subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule. ""Since then, Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity."" Read more: Argentinian leader denounces 'militarization' She cites a 1965 U.N. resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute, and calls on the British to abide by the resolution. The Sun's letter, addressed to Fernandez, rejects her assertions, saying: ""Claims that 180 years ago Argentina was stripped of the Falkland Islands are unfounded. Read more: Prince William deployed to Falkland Islands . ""No Argentinian civilian population was ever expelled. It was an Argentine garrison which had been sent to the islands to try to impose Argentine sovereignty over British sovereign territory. ""British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands dates back to 1765 -- before the Republica of Argentina even existed."" The islands have never been governed by Argentina or formed part of its territory, the newspaper states, adding: ""Until the people of the Falkland Islands choose to become Argentinian, they remain resolutely British. ""In the name of our millions of readers, and to put it another way: 'HANDS OFF!' "" The Sun, Britain's best-selling tabloid and part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, said in a story on its own pages that the Herald ""is an influential paper read by 50,000 people in the capital."" The islanders, who are due to hold a referendum on their political status this March, were also quick to dismiss the Argentinian position. In photos: Britain and Argentina's sovereignty standoff . ""We are not a colony,"" said Barry Elsby, a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands. ""Our relationship with the United Kingdom is by choice."" The British government swiftly rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the Falkland Islanders have chosen to be British. In a statement Thursday, the British Foreign Office said the islanders remain free to choose their own futures and ""have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N. Charter. This is a fundamental right for all peoples."" The statement added: ""There are three parties to this debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The islanders can't just be written out of history. ""As such, there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falklands Islands unless and until such time as the islanders so wish."" Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers (298 miles) east of the tip of South America, the Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources. The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British overseas territories and have been under British rule since 1833. The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982, when the then-Argentinian military government landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255. The latest exchange of views comes amid rising tension over the islands, which are home to about 3,000 people.","British newspaper says Argentinian claims to the Falkland Islands are unfounded .

"(CNN) -- For more than 50 years, the United States has had an embargo against the island of Cuba, all because we supposedly hate communism and believe the nation 90 miles from our borders should institute democracy. As the GOP candidates battle it out for votes in Florida's primary election on Tuesday, the subject of Cuba has come up in a couple of debates. Nearly all the candidates, except for Texas Rep. Ron Paul, have sounded ridiculous trying to defend what is clearly a failed policy, all in an effort to curry favor among the large population of Cuban voters in the state. Take, for instance, Newt Gingrich. The former speaker of the House was his usual fire-breathing self in the NBC-National Journal debate when he called on the United States to authorize regime change to get Fidel and Raul Castro out of their positions as leaders of the country. ""I would suggest to you the policy of the United States should be aggressively to overthrow the regime and to do everything we can to support those Cubans who want freedom,"" Gingrich said. ""You know, Obama is very infatuated with an Arab Spring. He doesn't seem to be able to look 90 miles south of the United States to have a Cuban Spring. ""So I would try to put in place a very aggressive policy of reaching out to every single Cuban who would like to be free, helping network them together, reaching out to the younger generation inside the dictatorship, and indicating they don't have a future as a dictatorship because a Gingrich presidency will not tolerate four more years of this dictatorship."" In what was the most ridiculous comment of the night, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said that if Cuba were China in terms of its geographical proximity to the United States, he would be just as against the country. ""This is an important doctrine of the United States to make sure that our hemisphere and those who are close to us are — are folks that we can and should deal with,"" Santorum said. ""And right now, we have and have had for 50 years a dictatorship in Cuba. We've had sanctions on them. They should continue. They should continue until the Castros are dead, and then we should make it very clear that if you want mountains of aid, if you want normal relationships, if you want to improve your economy, if you want to have the opportunity for freedom, that the United States stands ready now to embrace you now that you've gotten rid of these tyrants who — who have controlled you for these 50-plus years. That's why the sanctions have to stay in place, because we need to have a — a very solid offer to come forward and help the Cuban people."" Seriously? Is it possible for us to have a grown-folks conversation here? There is no logical reason that candidates should deplore normalizing relations with Cuba, while we do whatever we can to help China. Hmmm, let's see. Cuba is a communist country. China is a communist country. The people of Cuba aren't living in a democratic system. The people of China aren't living in a democratic system. Yet China has been granted most favored nation status, allowing the free flow of goods back and forth. Sorry, Rick, that has nothing to do with proximity. It's all about China being a great outpost for U.S. businesses, and the fact that the communist country is essentially the banker of America, owning hundreds of billions of dollars of our debt. Santorum wants to suggest that Cuba is in bed with Nicaragua and Venezuela, and they are in alignment with Iran, helping potential terrorists. Last I checked, we have relations with Russia, and they do huge business with Iran. We despise North Korea, yet China does a lot of business with North Korea. Folks, I'm fully supportive of democracy, and we should be preaching that gospel wherever we go. But there is no way I can believe that thawing our relationship with Cuba will somehow harm America. The Cuban-American community is loud, has major political clout and writes big checks, mainly to the GOP. But surely it's time for the adults to admit that the embargo has not forced Castro out of office, and all it has done is give him the best bogeyman he could get when talking to Cuban citizens. The United States should step up and end the embargo against Cuba and recognize that having real and substantive relationships with the nation could spur the democracy we say we want. ""I think it's time ... to quit this isolation business of not talking to people,"" Paul said. ""We talked to the Soviets. We talk to the Chinese. And we opened up trade, and we're not killing each other now. We fought with the Vietnamese for a long time. We finally gave up, started talking to them, now we trade with them. I don't know why — why the Cuban people should be so intimidating. ""I think we're living in the dark ages when we can't even talk to the Cuban people. I think it's not 1962 anymore. And we don't have to use force and intimidation and overthrow of a — in governments. I just don't think that's going to work."" It's time that the GOP candidates and officials in both parties stop the political pandering to Cuban Americans and say that if we want a free Cuba, it can begin with ending a senseless and failed embargo. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin notes Cuba has come up as issue in Florida GOP primary race .
The candidates have looked silly defending America's failed Cuba policy, he says .
Martin says only Ron Paul has the right idea about Cuba ."
"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan police have intercepted 41 children whom insurgents were planning to use as suicide bombers, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Tuesday. Four suspected insurgents were about to smuggle the children across the mountains into Pakistan from eastern Kunar province on Friday, said Sediq Seddiqi, the spokesman. ""We strongly believe that the children were being taken to Pakistan to be trained, brainwashed and sent back as Afghan enemies,"" Seddiqi said. The children are aged between 6 and 11, he said. Police handed the children back to their families after they were rescued in the Watapur district of Kunar province, he said. ""The insurgents cheat poor and ordinary Afghans and take away their children,"" Seddiqi said. Afghan and foreign forces have arrested many would-be suicide bomber children in the past. Earlier this month Afghan forces rearrested two children in Kandahar province on suspicion of planning to be suicide bombers. The two were from a group of would-be suicide bombers who were pardoned by President Hamid Karzai last summer, according to a press statement from the Kandahar governor's office. They had gone to Quetta, Pakistan, to get more training before being sent back to Afghanistan for suicide attacks, the statement said.","Four suspected insurgents were trying to smuggle 41 children abroad, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Google's technology certainly can map out driving directions and organize e-mail (or even make cars drive themselves). But can its digital tools take down drug cartels? The company says it can, with your help. ""We believe that technology has the power to expose and dismantle global criminal networks, which depend on secrecy and discretion in order to function,"" Google said in a blog post this week. ""And for the past few months, we've been working with people fighting on the front line to gain a better understanding of what drives these networks and how they function."" In coordination with the Council on Foreign Relations and the Tribeca Film Festival, Google Ideas -- the company's ""think/do tank"" -- hosted a conference in Los Angeles this week. Its goal: to come up with ways technology can be used to help dismantle illicit networks, from the drug and arms trades to human trafficking. The event was called the INFO Summit, short for Illicit Networks: Forces in Opposition, and it was designed largely to brainstorm these issues and to come up with technological solutions that could be implemented in the future. A YouTube channel has been created to house ideas from the event, but it was largely empty as of Thursday. Google says it wants to use technology to help people within illicit networks, as well as helping members of the public to shed light on the networks' illegal activities and ultimately dismantle them. The stakes for these activities are high. The United Nations estimates $2.1 trillion worth of illicit trade occurred in 2009. Violence also tends to surround these enterprises. Nearly 50,000 people have died in Mexico's drug violence since 2006, according to Mexican authorities. As part of the efforts, Interpol also announced the creation of an app and website called The Interpol Global Register. It's designed to help consumers and international law-enforcement groups track products that may be counterfeit or were traded illegally. A report about the app on Interpol's website (PDF) says the app will be available for iOS, Android, Windows and BlackBerry devices. It did not appear on Thursday to be available for download. Consumers can use the app to scan items and determine whether they were traded or created illegally. Illicit products are reported to authorities. The efforts by Google Ideas aim to go beyond using technology to expose wrongs in war zones and in illicit networks. The company wants to use tech to make a difference. ""What we have learned from Syria is just getting content out into the public domain is not enough. Simple naming and shaming doesn't solve the problems,"" Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas, told The Guardian in an interview at the conference. ""It gives people a voice but at the end of the day the way you're going to solve these problems is some kind of partnership between humans and computers working together."" Technology could also be used in closed states like North Korea, Stewart Patrick writes in a wrap-up of the INFO Summit on a Council of Foreign Relations blog. ""Illicit networks flourish in the darkness, where corruption is the norm and transparency is absent. This problem is most acute in so-called 'mafia states,' where the government has become a full-fledged criminal enterprise -- of which the 'soprano state' of North Korea is the most glaring example,"" he writes. ""But no country is exempt from corruption. And where transparency is lacking, there is no way for citizens to fight back."" In a way, by trying to address these problems, Google is acknowledging it has had a hand in fostering them, too. ""Internet-enabled technology, that which networks us together, has done a huge amount for humanity in general,"" Scott Carpenter, the principal at Google Ideas, said at the Oslo Freedom Forum earlier this year, according to a live blog. ""But it's also introduced complications, such as child pornography, transnational crime, and government repression. Technology has made these bad things easier. Simply, when you combine human beings with machines, the results can be marvelous, or they can be malevolent."" Google, whose unofficial motto is ""Don't Be Evil,"" says that any efforts to raise awareness about these problems could only help. ""We are trying to move the ball forward,"" Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. ""It seems to me if we can increase awareness of illicit networks, that in and of itself is progress.""","Google hosts a conference on tackling illicit global networks .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for James Holmes, the Aurora, Colorado, mass shooting suspect, took aim against the state's insanity defense laws in court documents made public Friday. ""Colorado's statutory scheme regarding the affirmative defense of insanity, and the introduction of any 'mental condition' evidence at trial or sentencing, is unconstitutional in many individual respects,"" they wrote in a 60-page motion and brief filed Thursday. The lawyers asked the judge to rule that parts of the state's insanity defense laws are unconstitutional . Among other issues, they cited the requirement that a defendant ""cooperate"" with examining psychiatrists as a violation of the defendant's privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Prosecutors have not said whether they will pursue the death penalty against Holmes, who is charged with 166 counts, including murder, attempted murder and other offenses in the July 20 shooting rampage in a movie theater that left 12 people dead and scores injured.

"(CNN) -- Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback apologized Monday for what he called his staff's ""overreaction"" to a disparaging tweet directed at him by a high school senior during a state Capitol visit. Emma Sullivan, 18, said late Sunday that a Brownback staffer had notified her school's principal about the tweet, and the principal told her she had to write an apology to the governor. On Monday -- the deadline for the letter, according to the teen -- the Shawnee Mission School District issued a statement stating that ""she is not required to write a letter of apology to the governor."" A statement issued by Brownback on Monday did not reference Sullivan by name or mention the prospect of any apology letter. He did emphasize his support for ""freedom of speech,"" while thanking ""the thousands of Kansas educators who remind us daily of our liberties, as well as the values of civility and decorum."" ""My staff overreacted to this tweet, and for that I apologize,"" the governor said. ""Freedom of speech is among our most treasured freedoms."" KSHB: School district responds . The teen made national headlines last week for a tweet she said was intended just for her friends. During a Kansas Youth in Government field trip to the state Capitol on November 21, Sullivan wrote: ""Just made mean comments at gov brownback and told him he sucked, in person #heblowsalot."" The Shawnee Mission East senior said she did not actually talk to Brownback, and the post referenced a joke she had with a student on the trip. The next day, she was called into high school Principal Karl Krawitz's office. ""I had no idea what it was about or why I was being called into the office,"" she said. ""I had never been in trouble before."" Sullivan claimed that the principal ""told me he needed to do damage control and was really upset."" Opinion: The girl who dared tweet Gov. Brownback . ""He said I was an embarrassment to the school and the school district and that I had been disrespectful,"" she added. The principal then asked her to write a letter of apology to Brownback and his staff. He set Monday as the due date for the letter. CNN contacted Krawitz's office but received no response. Sullivan said Sunday night -- when she still thought the apology letter was due -- that she wouldn't write it, adding that her parents and many of her peers supported her decision. ""I don't think I should write the letter, and I don't think it would be the best move for me,"" she said. ""At this time, I do not think an apology would be a sincere thing for me to do."" But that appeared to become a moot point when ""district officials"" in Shawnee Mission reviewed the case and asserted Monday that no apology was required and that no ""further action"" is expected on the issue. ""The district acknowledges a student's right to freedom of speech and expression is constitutionally protected,"" the district said in its statement. ""The district has not censored Miss Sullivan nor infringed upon her freedom of speech."" Sullivan said she had not heard from the governor's office directly. But, following the media attention, her Twitter follower count has rocketed from 65 to more than 4,000. ""I hope that the governor realizes the power of the people and how people can make things happen,"" she said. ""I also hope he will spend his time doing more productive things."" At the least, the student said that she hopes the controversy surrounding her tweet will bring attention to the issue of free speech. ""I hope there won't be any consequences and that my principal and the governor's office can move on,"" she said. ""The issue is relevant and, if anything, is a starting point of dialog with the governor about his policies and how our First Amendment rights can be taken away."" The school district likewise framed the matter as something that could be educational. ""The issue has resulted in many teachable moments concerning the use of social media,"" the district said.","NEW: School district officials say no apology is required; ""no further action"" upcoming .

"(CNN) -- American pop star Jennifer Lopez is catching all sorts of heat after her Saturday performance of ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to one of the world's most notorious dictators, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. ""It was our pleasure, and we wish you the very, very happiest birthday,"" Lopez says in a YouTube video of the performance. Statements like that feel gross, of course, if you know that Berdymukhamedov has been accused of imprisoning political dissidents, imposing ""draconian restrictions on freedom of expression and association,"" says Human Rights Watch, and, according to The Atlantic, ordering his goons to kill or get rid of stray cats. ""Singing happy birthday to dictators while dissidents and journalists die in their torture chambers?"" human rights lawyer Ronan Farrow (son of actress Mia Farrow) wrote on Twitter. ""Still Jenny from the block, @JLo?"" He followed-up that tweet with this orthographic quip about the pop star's visit to the former Soviet Bloc country, squished between Iran, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. ""More like Jenny from the bloc, am I right?"" The criticism is fully warranted. But there could be a positive here: When J-Lo and other celebrities stumble unknowingly (yes, apparently unknowingly: A publicist told CNN that ""had there been knowledge of human right issues of any kind, Jennifer would not have attended."" This, in the age of Google!) into human rights quagmires, a kind of awareness gets raised. J-Lo's concert in Turkmenistan may at least give the rest of us a chance to learn something about a desperate nation that never would make American headlines if not for such a celebrity appearance. Raise your hand if you could name (much less spell the name of) Turkmenistan's president before this weekend? Considering how well-controlled the country's Internet is, I'll assume you're not from there and knew almost nothing about the place. Now that we (J-Lo, that is) have your attention, consider these sobering facts: . • Freedom House ranks Turkmenistan as one of its ""Worst of the Worst"" countries. The group says Turkmenistan is ""not an electoral democracy"" since ""none of the country's elections ... have been free or fair."" Additionally: ""Employment and educational opportunities for ethnic minorities are limited by the government's promotion of Turkmen national identity. Freedom of movement is restricted, with a reported blacklist preventing some individuals from leaving the country. Traditional social and religious norms, inadequate education, and poor economic conditions limit professional opportunities for women, and anecdotal reports suggest that domestic violence is common."" • Human Rights Watch condemns Turkmenistan for imprisoning and silencing political opposition figures. ""As a result of more than two decades of the government's practice of using imprisonment as a tool for political retaliation,"" the group says, ""unknown numbers of individuals languish in Turkmen prisons on what appear to be politically motivated charges. During the previous (Universal Periodic Review), the government rejected an important recommendation to 'account for those prisoners whose fate is unknown.' The fate of some of several dozen prisoners convicted in relation to the November 2002 alleged assassination attempt on then-president Saparmurat Niyazov remains unknown, with their whereabouts not disclosed even to their families."" • Turkmenistan is basically North Korea plus oil, as Robert Kelly writes on the Asian Security Blog. (Hat tip to Max Fisher for spotting that. Specifically, Kelly says North Korea has been referred to as ""Turkmenistan without the oil."") • Berdymukhamedov (here's a pronunciation guide from Voice of America) hates pets as well as humans. Eurasianet quotes from a diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks: ""There have been reports about a recent incident in which a motorist crossed an intersection in front President Berdimuhamedov's motorcade as it moved through Ashgabat. Several high ranking police officials were fired after the incident, and the driver of the vehicle was reportedly beaten and charged with attempted assassination. In another incident, a military official was fired after a cat ran in front of the president's car as he was traveling to his dacha,"" or second home. Calls and e-mails to Turkmenistan's embassy in Washington were not returned on Tuesday morning. It would be easy to argue Lopez's performance served only to legitimize Turkmenistan's government. Or that her appearance could serve to paint the country (inaccurately) as a modern and welcoming place -- the kind of open, dance-ready society that loves freedom and rocks to ""Get Right."" Exactly the opposite is happening in the wake of her performance, however. People are learning a thing or two about how desperate Turkmenistan is. And a diva's visit with a despot can raise more than awareness. After being publicly shamed for performing on behalf of the government of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, Beyoncé, Usher, Mariah Carey and Nelly Furtado announced in 2011 that they had donated or planned to donate the money they received to charity. J-Lo should do the same, as New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has suggested. In effect, that would mean Turkmenistan's dictator unwillingly is funding human rights efforts. And it would be a sign J-Lo, too, learned something from this experience. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Singer Jennifer Lopez draws criticism for her performance in Turkmenistan .

"(CNN) -- The South African government has recalled its ambassador to Rwanda as diplomatic fallout over a suspected assassination attempt in Johannesburg continues. ""We have recalled the ambassador for consultations,"" said Saul Kgomotso Molobi, South Africa's chief director for public diplomacy. ""But this does not translate into the cutting off of diplomatic ties."" Relations between Kigali and Pretoria have been frosty since Gen. Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, a critic and rival to Rwandan President Paul Kagame, was shot and wounded in Johannesburg in June. Molobi said Ambassador Gladstone Dumisani Gwadiso was questioned by Rwandan authorities on South Africa's handling of the incident. The ambassador has been recalled to discuss those meetings, Molobi said. ""There have been issues raised by the Rwandan government, some of which relate to the shooting of General Nyamwasa,"" Molobi said. ""We will meet with our ambassador and then we will decide what course to take."" Rwanda has been tense leading up to its general election planned for Monday. A leader of the opposition Democratic Green Party was found dead near Butare, Rwanda, in July, his head almost severed from his body. The president of the party, Frank Habineza, told CNN that Andre Rwisereka had been receiving death threats since early this year. ""We are very threatened as a party and as individuals,"" he said. Journalist Jean-Leonard Rugambage was shot dead on June 24 outside his home in Kigali. Amnesty International said Rugambage had been investigating the Nyamwasa's shooting and on the day he died, the tabloid Umuvugizi published a story alleging that Rwandan intelligence officials were linked to Nyamwasa's shooting. Kagame has been praised for fostering growth and guiding his country to peace after the 1994 genocide there, but he has been criticized by human rights and press freedom groups for silencing dissent. The Rwandan government has repeatedly denied any involvement in the incidents in Rwanda and South Africa. Amnesty, a global human rights group, has condemned attacks on politicians and journalists, which it said has inhibited freedom of expression. Amnesty has urged the Rwandan government to ensure that polling is fair and free. ""In recent months killings, arrests and the closure of newspapers and broadcasters has reinforced a climate of fear,"" said a statement from Amnesty's Africa Programme Deputy Director Tawanda Hondora. ""The Rwandan government must ensure that investigations into the killings are thorough and reinstate closed media outlets."" Agnes Nkusi Uwimana, the editor of the Urubayo newspaper, was arrested in July and charged with ""genocide ideology,"" according to Amnesty. Other journalists have fled the country and as many as 30 media outlets have been banned, Amnesty said. ""No country should be a silent witness to pre-electoral repression,"" Hondora said. ""Speaking out about violations is the best way to ensure that the next Rwandan administration respects human rights."" Kagame is widely expected to be re-elected for a second seven-year term.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- ""Men don't play netball."" ""Men just jump like goats."" ""They can't handle it."" ""They are too serious."" ""They can't take abuse from the women."" ""They comPLAIN!"" That's how a group of Kenyan women describe the game of netball in a new (pre-viral?) video from a nonprofit group called Mama Hope, which seems bent on re-framing the way the Western world thinks of Africa, particularly African women. The group's campaign, called ""Stop the Pity,"" was launched here at the South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Texas. The goal, as the title makes clear, is to help women around the world by empowering them, celebrating their successes, instead of feeling bad about the vast inequalities that do exist. As anyone who's spent time in Africa will tell you, it's a diverse continent that's home to both immense joy and incredible sorrow. There's no shortage of tearjerker statistics. The World Bank, for example, says nearly half of people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 per day. Thirty-seven percent of people who lack access to clean water live in that region. It's also a hotbed for malaria, etc. Intense inequalities do exist. But even numbers tell another side to the story, as The Economist points out in a recent article titled ""Aspiring Africa."" ""Consumer spending will almost double in the next ten years; the number of countries with average incomes above $1,000 per person a year will grow from less than half of Africa's 55 states to three-quarters,"" the magazine said. And, most important: ""Africans deserve the credit. Western aid agencies, Chinese mining companies and U.N. peacekeepers have done their bit, but the continent's main saviors are its own people."" All the more reason to celebrate Mama Hope's efforts to focus on joy instead of suffering. The group's videos build on a rising chorus of voices calling for change in the way people from richer countries see those who live in poorer places. A blog called Aid Thoughts has been posting examples of what it considers ""poverty porn,"" or ads, videos and news stories that generally show Africans as one-dimensional victims. Others use the term ""badvocacy,"" which the blog Texas in Africa defines as ""a good catch-all term to describe advocacy that begins with great intentions to help those who are suffering, but that at best accomplishes nothing or at worst actually makes the problem even more difficult to solve."" Laura Seay, that blog's author and an assistant political science professor at Morehouse College, writes that advocates sometimes oversimplify issues or make them too sexy with the help of celebrities and flashy campaigns. The recently released video focuses on netball, a game it describes as a cross between basketball and ultimate Frisbee, because that's what the women wanted to discuss. ""We asked the women what they wanted to talk about,"" Nyla Rodgers, founder and ""chief visionary"" of Mama Hope told me. ""They really wanted America to know how much they love netball."" And it doesn't hurt that it's tracked with Beyonce's ""Run the World (Girls)."" Even if the Mama Hope video is highly produced, it's still possible to appreciate the fact that it's trying to promote empowerment and not pity or guilt. And the netball video is just one of several from the group. Another features a boy reciting the plot of an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. (YouTube views: 640,000). One shows men making fun of how Africans tend to show up in Hollywood movies toting guns and wearing scowls. (Views: 1.05 million) They're humorous and light. Designed to be shared. Rodgers says that's what's needed in 2013. ""We have to have partnership instead of pity,"" she said of the way the West interacts with Africa. ""Partnership doesn't include pity. It includes seeing people as equals and being able to work with them on an equal partnership."" It's an issue that's personal for Rodgers. It started with her ""brother from another mother."" That's how she explains her relationship with Bernard, a young boy in Kenya whose photo sat on her mother's mantle next to Rodgers'. ""I was always hearing about his grades and who his friends were,"" she said. Her mom, a dance teacher and writer, had adopted the boy in a way, sponsoring community development projects in his village, Rodgers said. After her mother died from cancer in 2006, Rodgers decided to visit the village and to meet Bernard. She told him, ""I'm going to take care of you now."" On the surface, if that doesn't sound like a ""white savior"" moment, I don't know what does. It conjures up images of condescending white missionaries trekking to Africa to dispense water, food and religion -- all to show their superiority. But Rodgers doesn't see it that way. ""If anything, I was in the deep depths of despair,"" because of her mother's death, ""and I saw how connected life is,"" she said. ""And that really saved me."" Mama Hope works with communities to start orphanages, improve sanitation and reduce poverty. But they only do so, she said, after living in the community for long enough that they can listen to people there about what problems could be solved with the help of outside funds or expertise. The group currently has 32 projects in four countries, she said, and an annual budget of about $500,000. And the best way to promote that work may be to stop pitying the people she's trying to help. They're friends, sisters, brothers, neighbors, netballers. But not victims. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","John Sutter talks with the woman behind a movement called ""Stop the Pity""

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- The Zimbabwean government has declared a national emergency in the face of a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 560 people, the state-owned newspaper The Herald said Thursday. A shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. Harare also appealed for help for its hospitals, which Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said ""are literally not functioning."" ""Our staff is demotivated and we need your support to ensure that they start coming to work and our health system is revived,"" he said at a meeting of donors including United Nations agencies, embassies and non-governmental institutions, The Herald reported. Cholera cases are on the increase in nine of Zimbabwe's 10 provinces, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned Wednesday. It blamed ""poor water and sanitation supply, a collapsed health system and limited government capacity to respond to the emergency."" OCHA said the water-borne outbreak had killed at least 565 people and sickened more than 11,000.  See more about Zimbabwe's cholera crisis » . In Harare province, more than one in four people to contract the disease had died and there were nearly 7,000 new cases, OCHA said. The health crisis is taking place against a background of increased security in the face of expected runs on banks. Armored cars patrolled the streets of Zimbabwe's capital and residents flocked to banks Thursday after limits on cash withdrawals were lifted in the inflation-ravaged African nation. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had capped maximum daily withdrawals at 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars -- about 25 U.S. cents, and about a quarter of the price of a loaf of bread. But faced with mounting chaos in a country already in economic free fall, the bank decided last week to raise that limit to 100 million dollars ($50 U.S.) per week. Soldiers were deployed to all banks in anticipation of throngs of people lining up to withdraw money Thursday, when the increase took effect. Wednesday, police chased depositors away and arrested union leaders who planned to protest the limits. Zimbabwe's inflation rate of 231 million percent is the world's highest. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said 69 people were arrested across the country during Wednesday's demonstrations. Amnesty International has demanded to know the whereabouts of human rights activist Jestina Mukoko. The group said Mukoko was abducted at dawn Wednesday by armed men in plainclothes posing as police. And angry, unpaid soldiers clashed with foreign currency exchangers and some civilians Monday, three days after troops who had failed to get cash from their banks looted shops they suspected to be illegally dealing in foreign currency.","Zimbabwean government declares national emergency over cholera outbreak .

"(CNN) -- A leader of a high-profile campaign pushing for women to drive in Saudi Arabia says she's suing traffic police in order to get a driver's license. Manal al Sharif told CNN Sunday that she filed an objection with the General Directorate of Traffic in Riyadh, the country's capital, when officials rejected her license application. After waiting 90 days and receiving no response, she filed her suit against them in November. ""It's just creating positive pressure on the officials to get back to us -- and it will encourage more women to apply for licenses and file lawsuits,"" she said. There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia. However, religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers. Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts, obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian. Al Sharif said her case had been transferred to Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry. Officials there could not be reached for comment. Al Sharif said she first applied for a license after being stopped by the authorities for driving a car last May. She was detained, spent nine days in jail and quickly became an icon of the ""Women2Drive"" campaign, an initiative demanding the right for women to drive and travel freely in Saudi Arabia. A Facebook page organizing a campaign for women to drive last June included a banner that read, ""We are all Manal Sharif,"" and a quote from King Abdullah stating that ""the day will come when women will be able to drive."" The single mother and information technology specialist's name first became a rallying cry for Saudi women last year after she uploaded a YouTube video of herself driving. Through the lawsuit, al Sharif said she is continuing her fight. ""There is no law forbidding women from driving,"" she said.","Manal al Sharif says she hopes the lawsuit will spark change .

"Washington (CNN) -- An immigration proposal crafted for months in secret by a high-profile, bipartisan cadre of senators is both a rare moment of simpatico in politics and a matter of political practicality. President Barack Obama, who won re-election with strong support from Latinos, the fastest-growing demographic, has called an overhaul of immigration a second-term priority. Meanwhile, Republicans who lost the Latino vote by large numbers, have signaled that mainstream members might be willing to compromise on thorny immigration issues. ""There aren't a whole lot of other issues where Republicans think they need to compromise or Democrats think they need to compromise,"" said Clyde Wilcox, a government professor at Georgetown University. ""There's two different ways this could be viewed this. It's either a Kumbaya moment ... or both sides see that on this particular issue there's a necessity for compromise."" But the deal is far from done. The plan could face stiff opposition in the House of Representatives, where conservatives and tea party leaders have resisted any compromise that even hints at relief or amnesty for those already in the country illegally. House Republicans are also working on a plan of their own, seeking bipartisan support. And Obama is said to have drafted his own detailed plan, which could differ from the Senate proposal in key areas, including border security and a path to legality. Obama to pitch immigration reform today in Vegas . The senators announced their plan a day before Obama speaks in Las Vegas on immigration, signaling a major push by both sides to focus on the contentious issue in the new Congress. Aides said the president's remarks on Tuesday will touch on the blueprint he's detailed in the past: improving border security, cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers and creating a pathway to ""earned"" citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Those provisions align closely with what the eight senators laid out in a framework of their legislation, which CNN obtained Sunday. Possible compromise on immigration takes shape . Obama previously came under criticism from Latino activists for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority of his first term. Last year, as the campaign heated up, the Obama administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the Latino community. Exit polls in November indicated Latino voters gave overwhelming support to Obama over GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves. Since the election, mainstream Republican leaders and some conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a child of Cuban immigrants and a rising star in the party, have called for addressing the immigration issue instead of ceding the Latino vote to Democrats. ""There is a new, I think, appreciation on both sides of the aisle -- including maybe more importantly on the Republican side of the aisle -- that we have to enact a comprehensive immigration reform bill,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said Sunday. ""We are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote, which we think should be ours, for a variety of reasons, and we've got to understand that,"" McCain told ABC's ""This Week."" McCain is one of the eight senators proposing the compromise. Four are influential Democrats, while Republicans joining McCain in the effort include tea party-backed newcomers Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona -- two states where immigration is a major issue. Democrats pointed to the proposal Monday as an example of bipartisan cooperation. ""I'm glad to see that there is bipartisan agreement among my colleagues regarding the principles of immigration reform,"" Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said in a statement. ""Hawaii residents are particularly interested in getting this done. Our state is an example of how our immigration system can work. We are a people of many stories and cultures, and our state is stronger because of the thousands of immigrants like me who have made Hawaii their home."" The Congressional Hispanic Caucus also hailed the effort. ""For many years, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has pushed for a permanent, legislative solution to our ineffective and unjust immigration system, and we believe 2013 will be the year this goal becomes reality,"" Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, the caucus chairman, said in a statement. ""The Senate's blueprint is a positive step toward this important goal, and we look forward to reviewing the details with the Senate. Their 'tough, but fair' approach provides a good foundation for the legislation that is needed. According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month, 53% of those polled said allowing illegal immigrants to become legal residents should be the main focus of U.S. policy, compared with 43% who said the focus should be on deportation and curbing illegal immigration. Those figures have flipped from 2011, when 55% of those polled favored deportation and nixing illegal immigration as a domestic policy focus and 42% said they favored a pathway to citizenship. Still, the immigration overhaul proposal faces partisan obstacles. Opinion: America needs 21st century immigration plan . Shortly after the immigration compromise was announced, conservative groups and lawmakers made it clear that they would oppose such a measure. NumbersUSA, a group seeking to reduce U.S. immigration, called the Senate plan an attempt to ""out-amnesty Obama"" and said it was activating its 1.3 million members to push for congressional opposition. ""No one should be surprised that individuals who have supported amnesty in the past still support amnesty,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who serves on that chamber's immigration subcommittee, in a statement. ""When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration. By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration."" The bipartisan compromise is encouraging, but several questions remain, said Norm Ornstein, a longtime political analyst and co-author of ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided with the New Politics of Extremism. Opinion: Stars align at last for immigration plan . ""One, will this compromise make it through the Senate, once the details are hammered out (always more difficult than frameworks) and with a lot more than 60 votes? Two, will House Republicans, who have very different impulses and constituencies, be supportive? Three, if not, will (House Speaker John) Boehner bring an immigration bill to the floor that will get many more Democratic votes than Republican?"" Ornstein said. Other Senate-led bipartisan efforts have faced similar chances of success. Proposals to resolve the debt crisis -- including the so-called super committee -- failed. The nation was able to avert the fiscal cliff narrowly thanks, in part, to the bipartisan efforts of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden. But political experts said that on immigration, there might be more room to meet in the middle. Still, for his part, Boehner was noncommittal. ""The speaker welcomes the work of leaders like Sen. Rubio on this issue, and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal in the coming days,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. CNN's Dana Bash and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Immigration plan a product of compromise from senators on both sides .

"(CNN) -- We each spend an average of three years of our lives sitting on them, King George II of Great Britain died while on his in 1760 and 2.5 billion people still do not have access to one. The humble lavatory is the unlikely subject of global celebration on Monday, as one of the world's most essential inventions but one that too many people still struggle without. Although many of us tend to take ours for granted, campaigners hope that World Toilet Day 2012 will draw attention to what they're calling the ""global sanitation crisis,"" with over a third of people worldwide living without a clean and private place to go. This means that one in three people still have to defecate in the open, using fields or bushes, rivers, railway lines or roadsides, or simply a plastic bag. Others use unsanitary latrines or disease-ridden and foul-smelling buckets. The majority of those without access to a toilet live in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia, with over half of people in Asia not having proper sanitation, according to the UK-based charity, WaterAid. Ajara lives in a slum in the city of Gwalior in the Madhya Pradesh province of India. She told WaterAid how people in her community have to defecate on a nearby hilltop. ""There are no trees and privacy at the moment and so we have to wait until night to go there. It's difficult for old people to go and it's hard to go at night. It's also hard for grown-up girls because of the risk of sexual attack,"" Ajara said. This World Toilet Day, international aid agencies are highlighting the particular risks to women of poor access to toilets. WaterAid says women are most vulnerable because they're not only exposed to disease, but also have additional shame, harassment and risk of attack when they go out in the open. Sandimhia Renato in Mozambique described to WaterAid how she has to cross a very dangerous bridge every time she goes to the bush to defecate. ""I think it takes 15 minutes to get to the bridge,"" Renato says. ""I come here once a day, between 4 and 5 pm. At night it is very dangerous. People get killed. A woman and a boy were killed with knives. One woman I know of has been raped."" But it's not just the shame and inconvenience of having no private place to go to the toilet, but a huge public health issue. When you consider that one gram of faeces can contain 10 million viruses, one million bacteria, one thousand parasite cysts and one hundred worm eggs (according to UNICEF) you can see why open defecation is so harmful to a community's health. Without a sewerage system to remove human waste and make it safe, cholera, typhoid and other infectious diseases spread quickly. The United Nations says more than 2.7 million people die each year due to lack of sanitation. With diarrhoeal diseases killing more young children in developing countries than HIV/AIDS, malaria and measles put together, it's the second biggest cause of death in under fives, according to the World Health Organization. Tackling it, says the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program, is extremely cost effective. It estimates that poor sanitation costs African countries around $5.5 billion a year and $53.8 billion in India is lost through associated economic impacts. The program's study of 18 African countries found that even the time it takes people to find a discrete location to use the toilet accounted for almost $500 million in economic losses. That's before you examine the cost of healthcare, premature deaths and lost workdays due to illness. In fact, according to the World Toilet Day organization, every dollar invested in sanitation yields a return of five dollars. Its message is that the solution to the global sanitation crisis lies not in any miraculous technological breakthroughs but in stronger political leadership and a commitment to invest in sanitation infrastructure and education. Mahatma Gandhi for one seemed to recognized the value of the toilet to humanity when he said ""Sanitation is more important than independence."" Campaigners for World Toilet Day will be hoping that these words resonate with today's leaders.","World Toilet Day highlights plight of 2.5 billion people who don't have access to basic sanitation .

"London (CNN) -- His blistering pace and larger-than-life antics made him the king of the track in London, and bolstered his claims to be a ""living legend."" Now figures released by Twitter and Facebook have confirmed that Usain Bolt was the most talked about athlete at the Olympics, edging out swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time. On Twitter, Bolt's two individual gold medal-winning sprints each generated more discussion than any other moment of Olympic competition. According to figures released by Andrew Fitzgerald, Twitter's editorial programming manager, Bolt's victory in the 200-meter sprint was the most discussed moment of competition, inspiring a flurry of more than 80,000 tweets per minute, . His earlier performance in the 100 meters was the most talked about Olympic moment on Facebook, and the second most talked about on Twitter, generating 74,000 tweets per minute. Bolt was a key figure in the fourth most discussed moment of competition on Twitter as well, when the Jamaican 4x100-meter relay team set a world record in their final. The victory to Great Britain's Andy Murray over Roger Federer in the men's tennis final was the third most talked about Olympic moment on Twitter, generating 57,000 tweets per minute. Bolt was followed by swim star Phelps at the top of Twitter's list of the 10 most talked about athletes, each of whom was mentioned more than a million times on the service. Read more: London 2012's top 10 moments . The multiple gold medalists were followed by British diver Tom Daley (3), US swimmer Ryan Lochte (4), American gymnast Gabby Douglas (5), Murray (6), US basketball player Kobe Bryant (7), Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake (8), Malaysian badminton player Lee Chong Wei (9) and American basketball player LeBron James (10) Facebook's line-up was slightly different, but Bolt and Phelps held on to the first and second spots, followed by Douglas (3), Lochte (4), Daley (5), Brazilian soccer player Neymar (6), Murray (7), British athlete Jessica Ennis (8), South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius (9) and American tennis player Serena Williams (10). Known as the global game, it is little surprise that soccer was the most discussed Olympic event on Twitter: the subject of more than 5 million tweets. Also popular were swimming, track and field, gymnastics, and volleyball. Read more: London 2012 -- trust the British to get it right . But the spectacles of the opening and closing ceremonies generated even more chatter than any of the sporting events.. Both ceremonies drove large spikes in Twitter conversation, with the biggest generated by the reformed Spice Girls, whose closing ceremony performance prompted more than 116,000 tweets per minute. But if Bolt -- whose Twitter biography proclaims himself the ""most naturally gifted athlete the world has ever seen"" -- takes umbrage at being temporarily overshadowed by a 90s girl group, he can turn to his Facebook fans for solace. While the Spice Girls, who had their heyday in a world before social media, can muster only 166,000 fans on Facebook, Bolt has more than 8 million of them.","Usain Bolt was the most talked about athlete on social media, say Twitter and Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Muirfield has gone the extra mile as it prepares to host the British Open Championship -- golf's third major of 2013 -- this week. The grandstands are proudly in place, the pale greens are shorn and clipped and rakes nestle in the hollows of the bunkers waiting to smooth over sand disheveled by mishit balls. But despite all this meticulous preening it is the extra 158 yards that matters most. The seaside links course now unravels for 7,192 yards -- when the course was first opened on the Scottish east coast in 1891 it rolled over a mere 6,200 yards. The total yardage for the Masters at Augusta ran to 7,435, June's U.S. Open at the Merion Golf Club was 6,996 while the next major, the USPGA, is to be played on the Oak Hill course runs a total of 7,134 yards. This year new tees have been added on seven of the holes at Muirfield to match the prowess of the game's big-hitters and extend the overall playing distance for the 142nd British Open. ""The changes were made really just to strengthen the course,"" Colin Irvine, the Muirfield course manager, told CNN. ""Golfers have got better and equipment has got better. ""A lot of this work was done over a two-to-three year period and we're now doing the final tweaking to make it look like everything has been here for years."" The biggest change, made to spice up golf's oldest major, lies in wait at the ninth hole. Previously thought of as short by modern par-five standards, the tee has been moved back almost 50 yards thanks to a land swap with the neighboring Renaissance Golf Club. A new bunker has been added to the right of the ninth fairway and the existing sand trap has also been moved closer to the green. The sandy, new hazard was carved out with a ""big digger"" before the soil was put back, contoured and new turf laid down. ""It gives it a nice finish and you can't really see that anything has been there,"" said Irvine, casting a backwards glance at the grassy bumps hiding the scooped out earth. ""It was quite a wide, open area up here for hitting the second or third approach shot so the changes put a lot more thought to landing on the small green now. ""A lot of people [who have tested the new layout] have found these bunkers very difficult. ""One of the key areas we've changed across the course since 2002 is the greenside bunkering. We've brought them in a little bit tighter and made them more gathering for a ball to roll in easier."" It is the 16th time that Muirfield has hosted the Open and the first since South African Ernie Els triumphed 11 years ago following a dramatic four-man play-off that went to sudden death on the fifth extra hole. Els returns to Muirfield as the defending Open champion after another emotional win at Royal Lytham last year. The East Lothian course has attempted to move with the times away from the greens and fairways too by introducing Wi-Fi zones for spectators around the course as well as LED scoreboards. A ban on mobile phones was also lifted last year and, as there have been no complaints from the players, spectators will once again be allowed to use them, so long as they ""respect the game."" But it's traditions that the Scottish course prides itself on as well as its knotty rough and brisk coastal breezes. When the world's leading male players return to joust for the honor of winning the Claret Jug, the hope is they will find very little has changed on the surface. ""It's our duty to keep our famous links course providing the test we need to identify a champion,"" said Dawson. ""Muirfield has always been a very, very strong venue. The players love it and they think it's fair. Many of the changes you can't see and won't even know they've been done. ""When the players come here they'll recognize the Muirfield they know and love.""","Muirfield increases total yardage for golf's big-hitters at the 2013 British Open .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department defended its scrutiny of reporters around a high-profile national security leak investigation, saying on Tuesday that it followed its own regulations in acquiring subpoenas for Associated Press phone records. But a letter from Peter Kadzik, principal deputy assistant attorney general, to members of Congress failed to answer a key question asked by lawmakers: When did Attorney General Eric Holder formally recuse himself from the leak investigation? Holder said in congressional testimony that he took that step to avoid a possible conflict of interest because he had been interviewed about the leak during the course of the investigation. That investigation centered on who told the AP about a 2012 plot by an al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen to bomb an airliner. Opinion: Eric Holder should discuss leaks publicly . The issue has generated sharp political controversy. Lawmakers have claimed investigative overreach by the Obama administration and media outlets have expressed concerned about the potential chilling effect of such efforts on press freedoms. Specifically, the Republicans are concerned about whether Holder was being truthful during May 15 congressional testimony. ""With regard to potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I have ever been involved in, heard of, or would think would be a wise policy,"" Holder said. It later came to light Holder had authorized a search warrants for e-mails and subpoenas for phone records in another leak case in which the government indicated a TV reporter was suspected of breaking the law. This stoked more controversy. The letter from Kadzik in response to congressional follow-up to Holder's testimony said Deputy Attorney General James Cole, who approved the subpoenas for the AP records, also had been interviewed by investigators during the leak probe. 5 things about the controversy surrounding AG Eric Holder . According to the letter, Cole did not have any contacts with the media at the time ""thus avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest."" The subpoenas involved records for more than 20 AP phone lines for part of April and May 2012. The toll records would show what numbers were dialed from the AP lines and what numbers dialed in, but would not provide any information on the content of conversations. According to the letter to the House Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department followed its rules and exhausted other methods to find out who might have leaked the classified information before seeking the phone records. The letter said investigators conducted more than 550 interviews and examined tens of thousands of pages of documents before issuing subpoenas involving the AP lines. Justice Department rules call for negotiations with news organizations on such issues unless there is a ""substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation."" The Justice Department said because the investigation was ongoing it couldn't provide specific information on why the Justice Department didn't go directly to the AP.","Justice Dept. response to Congress says it followed rules in scrutiny of Associated Press .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- There are essentially three generations of job seekers vying for jobs today: Baby Boomers, Generation X or Gen X, and Generation Y or Millennials. Because of this, job seekers are finding themselves competing with people of all different ages for the same job; people that can bring different experiences and skill sets to the position. I asked career coaches, advisers and recruiters if there are any patterns in how job seekers from different generations go about the job search. Here are some that they noted: . Baby Boomers: Often show a high level of professionalism and excel in face-to-face interviews. ""Baby Boomers know that the job search is ultimately about relationships, and [they] tend to invest the time in the process of developing relationships,"" says Lynne Sarikas, executive director of the MBA Career Center at Northeastern University. ""They know the value of a handwritten thank-you note."" Gen X: Tend to utilize both in-person and online communication effectively. ""When it comes to overall communication skills and working knowledge of technology, members of Generation X fall squarely between their 20-year-old and 50- to 60-year-old counterparts,"" says Maribeth Kuzmeski, author of ""The Connectors: How the World's Most Successful Businesspeople Build Relationships and Win Clients for Life."" ""They are used to online job searches, emailing résumés and following up via both email and handwritten notes."" Millennials: Often adept at using all forms of social media in their job search. They tend to embrace all kinds of technology and use that technology to their advantage, including applying via their smartphone or tablet or following up via creative ways online. ""[Job seekers] over 50 years old may be used to looking for work in a newspaper, attending job fairs, dropping by a company to inquire about job leads and speaking to those in their network regarding job opportunities,"" says Lavie Margolin, career coach, speaker and author of ""Lion Cub Job Search: Practical Job Search Assistance for Practical Job Seekers."" ""A younger generation would be more apt to look for jobs online and use social networks to reach out to people for help as opposed to speaking to people face-to-face or giving someone a call."" So how do job seekers compete with those from other generations? Perhaps it's by learning from each other and applying a combination of new and tried-and-true job-search tactics. Here are some tips on how job seekers of all generations can be successful in their job hunt. Embrace both offline and online communication . To get the most out of a job search, try using both online and offline resources. Search for jobs on career websites as well as social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. Consider building an online portfolio that houses your résumé along with examples of your work or previous successes, but don't forget to bring hard copies to an interview, too. Also try meeting with a headhunter or recruiter who specializes in finding jobs in the field for which you're applying. Networking works . ""Regardless of generation, the single most important thing you can do to support your job search is networking,"" Sarikas says. ""Identify alumni, former colleagues, friends of friends or family who work in the companies you are interested in as employers. Conduct informational interviews to learn about the company, the culture and the types of roles in your area of interest. Meet as many people as possible who can help support your efforts, and identify how you can help them as well. While you can use the Internet and other tools to identify resources, do your networking in person whenever possible. Have a real conversation."" Execution matters . ""Execution matters — cover letters and résumés must be flawless; no spelling or grammatical errors,"" Sarikas says. ""You should be well prepared for your interview. Research the company and the people you are meeting. Have questions prepared. Information is easily accessible, so there is no excuse for not being well prepared."" The power of thank you . Follow up with both an email and a snail mail thank-you note. ""Write a handwritten thank-you note to each interviewer and show your enthusiasm for the job as well as your appreciation for their time. It makes them remember you in a positive way,"" Sarikas recommends. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- The biggest upset of the NFL playoffs took place this week when Rex Ryan, the most controversial head coach in professional sports, stepped behind a podium and said, well, nothing. ""I don't have a whole lot to say, so let's open it up for questions,"" said Ryan, the man whose words have been the talk of professional football since he became the head coach of the New York Jets. Ryan has brazenly talked about winning a Super Bowl from the moment he took the job two years ago. He called his playoff matchup against future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts ""personal,"" then made the same statement this week about facing New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick on Sunday. He has come under fire for making an obscene gesture at a mixed martial arts event and his R-rated language during the HBO series ""Hard Knocks"" this summer. Each week this fall, whether it be the foot-fetish videos that apparently involve him and his wife or his constant barrage of brash talk, Ryan has been the most talked about figure in New York sports. It is unclear how the videos, which were posted on the sports website Deadspin, ended up on the internet, but they were a rare example of something Ryan would not talk about. He repeatedly called the issue ""a personal matter,"" but it still landed him on the front pages of the tabloids. Depending on who you ask, he is the best thing to happen to the NFL in years: a refreshingly honest force of nature who has proven that a coach doesn't have to be a cliché-spewing robot to be successful. Or, he is an egotistical blowhard who has put unnecessary pressure on his team with his boastful statements, especially since the Jets must beat the hottest team in football, the 14-2 Patriots, on the road Sunday to advance in the playoffs. There is no middle ground with Ryan. Is he good for football? That is open to debate. But, no matter what you think of the 47-year-old head coach, this much is certain: Everyone is talking about him. ""The mistake any coach makes is trying to be someone he's not,"" said Jim Fassel, who took the Giants to the Super Bowl in 2000 and worked with Ryan when Ryan was a defensive coach with the Baltimore Ravens. ""Rex is always going to be Rex. That's him. You can either like it or not like it, but I like it when a coach is being himself. You won't get Bill Belichick to do that."" Belichick, the three-time Super Bowl winner in New England, is the perfect contrast. He was asked in the days leading up to this second-round playoff game his opinion about the bravado coming out of his opponent, and his response was typically subdued. ""Our job, really, is just to get ready for the game,"" Belichick said, ""so that's what we're going to go do."" Ryan has the same job, of course, and he's doing something right. In just two seasons, he already has more playoff victories, with three, than any Jets coach to come before him. He is regarded as one of the brightest defensive minds in the game, a whiz for coming up with the perfect blitz packages to rattle the opposing quarterbacks. Not that anybody spends much time talking about that. ""He's a sideshow to everyone outside of New York,"" Evan Roberts, a host of the sports-radio station WFAN, told his audience during a spirited debate about the pros and cons of Ryan's constant chatter. ""They laugh at him."" They may laugh at him, but they certainly pay attention to him. Much like his father, Buddy, he has made most of his news with his outsized personality. Buddy Ryan was the defensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears, the mastermind of maybe the greatest defense in NFL history. The Bears won the Super Bowl after the 1985 season, and Buddy Ryan went on to become a head coach in Philadelphia and Arizona. But the elder Ryan was a failure as a head coach most known for controversy. He once said a player he cut was ""worth about two beers and they don't have to be cold ones."" He is the coach who threw a punch at Kevin Gilbride, then the offensive coordinator on his own team. ""I'm not smart enough to lie,"" the now retired elder Ryan said last season when asked about his penchant for creating controversy. ""If you're honest, you have nothing to worry about. If you lie, you have to watch what you say."" Rex Ryan saw that devil-may-care attitude up close. He started his slow climb up the coaching ladder in 1987, making $200 a week as a graduate assistant at Eastern Kentucky University, before becoming part of the Baltimore Ravens staff that won the Super Bowl in 2000. ""When I was a defensive coordinator I would say the same things, but instead of having this many reporters,"" he said to a room with about 100 of them, ""there may have been one or two. That's about it. Now, it's just a bigger stage, but I was still the same person then as I am now."" That person has continued to violate virtually every unspoken rule about coaching a football team. Coaches are never supposed to provide bulletin-board material for their opponents. Ryan does it weekly. Coaches are supposed to guard information like state secrets. Ryan is like a human WikiLeaks when it comes to injury reports, offering up more than the league requires. Owner Woody Johnson knew a big personality came with his new coach, but even he had no idea just how big. ""When I saw that first press conference, it took my breath away a little bit,"" Johnson said. ""I was so happy he had the confidence to state what his objective is. It's easier to lead people to someplace that you can talk about."" The Jets have followed their leader. This week, the biggest story was not how their young quarterback Mark Sanchez would do against the New England defense, but how one of their cornerbacks, Antonio Cromartie, announced that he ""hated"" Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (using a few unprintable words in the process). The response from Ryan? No apology. ""You shouldn't like who you are up against right now,"" he said. ""This is the playoffs. I can tell you our whole football team respects Brady and the Patriots. There's no question, but hey, we don't like any of them right now. You shouldn't. I think that's just part of it and trust me, the feeling is mutual."" Ryan's team has supplanted the old-school Giants as the dominant team in the New York market, maybe for the first time in its history. His team has stolen the pages of the New York tabloids for months, and as long as the Jets keep winning, that doesn't figure to change any time soon. The NFL is a copycat league. The Patriots' success has spawned an army of Belichick clones, with only modest success. Could Rex Ryan lead a similar revolution of brash-talking coaches around the league? Even one of his longtime players isn't sure about that. ""I don't know if the NFL is ready for an onslaught of Rex Ryans,"" Jets linebacker Bart Scott said with a laugh. Right now, one Ryan is stirring up enough controversy all on his own.","New York Jets coach Rex Ryan makes headlines with brash statements .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- OutKast's Big Boi is a junkie, has been for years. Big Boi: ""You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair."" The multiplatinum rap star got his first shoe fix back when he was better known as Antwan Patton, a busboy at Steak and Ale. He saved up his paychecks and rushed to a dealer to cop the only thing that could cure his jones -- a pair of British Knights tennis shoes. ""I've actually been into sneakers since I was a little kid,"" Big Boi, 34, said backstage before his concert this month at the Sneaker Pimps exhibition in Atlanta. ""You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair."" Sneaker culture has thrived for decades, but shoe companies have increasingly capitalized on the demand for one-of-a-kind kicks. Collectors, known as sneakerheads, have lined up to pay hundreds, even thousands, of dollars to ensure few people are wearing the same shoes.  See some of the rarest shoes » . ""Coming up, my mom got five kids so there wasn't a whole lot of stylish tennis shoes around the house, so I used to want a lot of sneakers,"" Big Boi said, explaining that he started making up for lost time -- and shoes -- long before OutKast's 1994 debut, ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik."" Juan Castaneda, 27, also grew up in a family of modest means and longed to don the fresh kicks he saw his peers wearing. ""When I got money to buy them, I started catching up,"" said Castaneda, who works at a nursing home in Hendersonville, North Carolina. He estimates he owns about 200 pairs of sneakers, including a pair of Nike Air Jordan XIs with patent-leather trim called ""Space Jams."" They cost him $500. It's supply and demand at its simplest, said Elliott Curtis, a former Carnegie Mellon University basketball player who for two semesters taught Sneakerology 101, billed as the first accredited class on sneaker culture. Shoe companies create a limited number (say, a few hundred pairs) of shoes -- even if it's just an old model with new colors or materials -- and demand automatically spikes. ""It's like a status symbol. If Nike is selling a shoe for $2,000, they're not expecting to sell that many,"" the recent graduate said, adding that sneakerheads are drawn to scarcity. ""If they've got money, they can buy coolness,"" Curtis said. Curtis goes to garage sales and mom-and-pop stores seeking rare and retro sneakers for his 75-pair collection, but he concedes he's waited in line for limited editions and paid as much as $250 for a pair. Sporting an ultra-rare set of blue-and-red ""Bugs Bunny"" Nike Air Jordan VIIIs, Big Boi said he today boasts at least 400 pairs of sneakers, but he rarely pays for them because shoe companies send him pairs. His most expensive, a pair of crocodile-skin Nike Air Force 1s, sell on various auction sites for up to $1,800. Big Boi has never worn them, but he plans on taking them out of their Nike lockbox this summer so he can wear them in a video for his upcoming solo album. To Peter Fahey, the mastermind behind Sneaker Pimps shoe shows, Big Boi's enthusiasm is typical. Sneaker culture got its start in New York in the 1970s, mostly among playground streetballers and practitioners of an emerging genre of music called hip-hop. Over the next three decades, rappers and basketball players -- most notably, Run DMC and Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan -- would play integral roles in boosting the popularity of rare kicks. ""Run DMC were probably at the height of the whole movement. It was the first time music and sneakers crossed like this,"" Fahey said of the group's 1986 hit, ""My Adidas."" Today, Adidas, Nike and Puma compete with luxury brands such as Chanel, Prada and Gucci. The major sports shoe companies also allow customers to design their own shoes. Upstarts such as San Francisco's JB Classics and Japan's Madfoot and KKOK have snatched up market share as well. Shoe companies realize hip-hop's influence and work hard to get ""a fresh pair of steps"" on a rapper's feet. Earlier this year, Converse released a line of its iconic All-Stars in tandem with Chicago rhymesmith Lupe Fiasco. Nike has issued two versions of the Air Yeezy, inspired by rapper-producer Kanye West. Louis Vuitton also has teamed up with West. Some lines, such as the Yeezys, quickly become collectors' items. Die-hard sneakerheads keep them in their original boxes like ""Star Wars"" action figures and ferret them away in closets, their soles never to be scuffed by a sidewalk. Bryan Lyle, 22, of Stockbridge, Georgia, said he recently camped out three nights at an Atlanta boutique to get one of the shop's eight pairs of Air Yeezys. Lyle paid $300, a small fortune for shoes, but Castaneda said the price more than doubled within days. He got a pair of Yeezys from an eBay merchant in Hong Kong. The damage? $700. Melissa Bailey of Hendersonville, North Carolina, takes photos at the Sneaker Pimps show. Castaneda's girlfriend, Melissa Bailey, 26, said Castaneda actually bought three pairs. He found two online and paid someone to camp out for the others. Castaneda's modus operandi is to buy three pairs of his favorite shoes -- one to wear, one to store for later and one to sell or trade, she said. ""He will not walk through grass. He will not walk through dirt,"" Bailey said. For the last six years, Fahey has had a front-row seat for the evolution of sneaker culture. He held the first Sneaker Pimps show in Sydney, Australia, in 2003, but only 200 people showed up, belying the trend's rising popularity. Soon, however, tens of thousands would attend shows in more than 60 cities. A 2006 show in Jakarta, Indonesia, drew about 13,000 sneakerheads. The shows now feature between 1,000 and 1,500 shoes. Some are rare. Others are signed by celebrities. Hip-hop acts are a staple, as is artwork -- on both kicks and canvas. At this month's show, hundreds of sneaker enthusiasts filed through Atlanta's Tabernacle with the decorum of museum patrons, stopping to admire the shoes displayed on swaths of chain-link fence. There were novice sneakerheads, such as Chris Shepherd, 20, and Charnelle Cook, 20, an Atlanta couple who marveled over the DC Comics and Transformers sneakers. Asked about her multicolored hightops, Cook said, ""I couldn't tell you what these are called. All I know is they're Reeboks, and they're fly."" There were seasoned collectors, such as Kyle Self, 35, of Decatur, Georgia, who said he had about 25 pairs, some of them still in their boxes. Included in the group are three pairs of $400 low-top Pradas, which he called his ""everyday sneakers."" There were even female collectors, such as artist Estasha Goodwin, 23, who modeled a pair of shimmering gold, winged -- yes, winged -- hightops made by Adidas and designer Jeremy Scott. She complained that shoe companies too often focus on the male market and ignored female aficionados. ""When they do cater to us, it's always bubblegum pink. They don't even make them in our sizes,"" she said. ""I know women who know more about sneakers than any dude out here today."" Incidentally, her favorite of the 15 pairs she owns were made for men -- the Nike ""Ace of Spades"" Dunks, inspired by the Detroit Tigers' high-kicking pitcher, Dontrelle Willis, who is prominently featured on the black-and-aqua shoe's hightop. Asked why she shelled out $250 for them, she gave a familiar response: ""It's a feeling you get when you know you're the only one that has something. Even if you're not, it's the way you walk it.""","Big Boi says he has 400 pairs, including crocodile-skin Nikes he's never worn .

"(CNN) -- Over a billion dollars was spent, the English Premier League title was won, its neighbors' feathers were duly ruffled, but the pressure to adapt to European football proved too much for Manchester City says Carlos Tevez. Tevez, who signed for Juventus in a $13 million deal last month, enjoyed four years at City where he helped the club win the FA Cup and a first league title in 44 years, when they pipped rivals Manchester United on the last day of the 2011/2012 season. But it was the club's failure in European competition which left a sour taste in Tevez's mouth with City failing to in their bid to compete with the continent's biggest clubs. City has failed to progress from the Group Stage of Europe's elite competition in each of the past two seasons and the Argentine striker says the pressure and expectation on the players proved too great for the team to handle. ""Yes, there was way too much pressure,"" Tevez told CNN. ""It came from everyone -- the club, the fans. I think that too much pressure just hurts the team. ""What happened was that there so much hype and pressure to be one of the giants of Europe and we didn't do it. ""We dropped out in the first round of the Champions League on both occasions."" City will now hope that new manager Manuel Pellegrini will help to turn its fortunes around following the departure of Roberto Mancini. City's former Italian coach and Tevez endured a difficult relationship with the Argentine's apparent refusal to warm up during a Champions League tie at Bayern Munich in September 2011. Subsequently the Italian announced that Tevez would never play for the club again before finally relenting, but the Argentine says he only has respect for his former manager. ""He's a winner,"" added Tevez. ""I think he's a winner because he always wants to win and he takes his team to the maximum place to be able to win. Everyone who knows Mancini knows that he's a winner from birth."" Tevez's new club, Juventus, last won the Champions League back in 1996 and reached the quarterfinals last season before losing to eventual champion Bayern Munich. The Turin club has not reached the final since it suffered a heartbreaking penalty shootout defeat by Milan in 2003 at Old Trafford. While Antonio Conte's side have won Serie A for the past two years, it is the European crown which the club craves. But Tevez is aware of how such pressure can be detrimental to a team's chances of success with City just one example of how players can be adversely affected. ""I think we have to be calm and make sure we don't put pressure on ourselves to win the Champions League,"" added the 29-year-old as he looked to ahead to the challenge of playing in Europe with Juventus. ""If we don't then that pressure will become impossible to escape from. ""We have to be calm and know that winning the Scudetto again will make us part of Italian history and then we can think about everything else. ""We all dream of winning the Champions League but our main objective is winning Serie A. ""Then we can be calm in the Champions League and everything will become a lot easier.""","Carlos Tevez joined Juventus from Manchester City in $13 million transfer .

"(CNN) -- A Hong Kong man who brought a Filipino maid with his family when they moved to Vancouver -- but then made her work 16 hours a day for 21 months and allowed her one phone-call a month -- has been convicted of human trafficking in a landmark verdict. In the first conviction for human trafficking in Canada, a British Columbia Supreme Court found 50-year-old father of three, Franco Orr Yiu-kwan, guilty of illegally employing a foreign national and immigration breaches. His partner, Nicole Huen Oi-ling, was acquitted of the charges. ""My clients are in shock frankly,"" defense lawyer Nicholas Preovolos, told CNN affiliate CBC News. ""They're stunned. It's an odd verdict, in that the jury apparently believed a number of allegations that Ms. Sarmiento made against Mr. Orr, but didn't believe the allegations she made against Ms. Huen."" Leticia Sarmiento, 40, told the court she was brought to Canada in 2008 with promises that the couple would help her get permanent resident status within two years and help bring her three children to Vancouver from the Philippines, CBC News reported. When she arrived in Vancouver, however, she says she was required to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week, with no days off and no statutory holidays. She said that after a temporary visitors' visa was acquired in Hong Kong, the couple withheld her passport from her. In Canada, she claimed, they restricted her movements and prevented her from talking to anyone. Things came to a head in June 2010 when Sarmiento called the police after getting into a confrontation with Huen. The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported that she told the court that while she had a good relationship with her employers in Hong Kong, ""things had changed dramatically in Canada."" She said apart from caring for the couple's three children, she was required to do cooking and cleaning duties that another domestic helper had performed in Hong Kong. Preovolos argued that Sarmiento was lying under oath, and was motivated by the damages that could ensue from a civil lawsuit that has yet to be heard in a B.C. Supreme Court. He argued that Sarmiento had begged the couple to take them with her when they moved to Canada following a business failure in Hong Kong and had refused to leave when her six-month tourist visa expired even though Orr had purchased a return ticket to the Philippines for her. He told the court that in 2010 the couple had bought her another ticket to return home to the Philippines and it was only then that Sarmiento, desperate to stay in Canada, had called police. Sarmiento agreed she planned to apply for permanent residency in Canada. A defense witness also testified that Sarmiento had provided her passport when she unsuccessfully tried to open a Canadian bank account, undermining her testimony that the couple had confiscated her passport. Orr remains free on bail, pending sentencing on July 10. The charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $1 million fine.","Hong Kong man convicted of human trafficking in landmark case in Vancouver .

"(CNN) -- BP and plaintiffs involved in the legal battle over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill -- the largest in U.S. history -- have reached an agreement, both sides said late Friday. BP estimated that it would have to pay about $7.8 billion in the Deepwater Horizon disaster settlement. ""The proposed settlement represents significant progress toward resolving issues from the Deepwater Horizon accident and contributing further to economic and environmental restoration efforts along the Gulf Coast,"" said Bob Dudley, the CEO of BP. A group representing the plaintiffs in the case said the settlement ""will fully compensate hundreds of thousands of victims of the tragedy."" ""The settlement is to be fully funded by BP, with no cap on the amount BP will pay,"" the group added. U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier wrote in an order that the two sides have ""reached an agreement on the terms of a proposed class settlement which will be submitted to the court for approval."" A civil trial on the issue was scheduled to take place in Louisiana federal court. Among the defendants were BP, the well operator and majority shareholder in the venture, rig-owner Transocean, construction contractor Halliburton and other firms associated with the project. Among the thousands of plaintiffs are fishermen, hotel owners and other Gulf Coast residents. The three-month-long spill, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, was triggered after an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010. Eleven people were killed in the blast.

"London (CNN) -- British author Hilary Mantel has become the first woman to win the Man Booker Prize twice. Mantel, 60, won the prestigious Â£50,000 ($81,000) literary prize Tuesday for her novel ""Bring up the Bodies,"" the second in a historical trilogy set during the reign of King Henry VIII. She also won the prize in 2009 for ""Wolf Hall,"" the first novel in the trilogy. ""You wait 20 years for a Booker Prize and then two come along at once,"" she told reporters, adding, ""I feel a bit weak at the knees to be honest."" ""This double accolade is uniquely deserved,"" said Sir Peter Stothard, chairman of the judging panel and editor of the Times Literary Supplement. ""In 'Bring up the Bodies,' our greatest modern writer retells the origins of modern England."" Mantel is the third author to win the prize twice, alongside South-African-born J.M. Coetzee and Australian Peter Carey. This year, she overcome competition from 144 other entries, including the shortlisted, ""Umbrella"" by Will Self; ""Narcopolis"" by Jeet Thayil; ""Swimming Home"" by Deborah Levy; ""The Lighthouse"" by Alison Moore; and ""The Garden of Evening Mists"" by Tan Twan Eng. Also on Leading Women: Nobel Peace Prize winner rips fellow laureate over corruption . A former social worker who lived in Botswana and Saudi Arabia before returning to the U.K., she did not have her first novel published until she was in her mid-30s. She said the idea for her trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's chief minister, first came to her when she was in her 20s, but she was not in a position to write it for more than three decades. Established in 1969, the Man Booker is the best-known fiction prize for English-language authors from Commonwealth countries and Ireland. It is intended to reward literary heavyweights rather than bestsellers. While sales are not a factor in the judges' decision, authors typically experience a dramatic increase in sales after receiving the prize. Weekly sales in the U.K. of last year's winner, ""Sense of an Ending"" by Julian Barnes, jumped from 2,535 to 14,534 -- an increase of 473% -- in the week it won, according to Nielsen Bookscan. In the week she won the prize in 2009, Mantel enjoyed a 463% rise in weekly sales and more than 600,000 in total sales in the U.K. She joked then that she would spend the prize money on ""sex, drugs and rock and roll."" This time around, she said she would probably spend it on her pension, although she said she still has writing years left in her, despite suffering ""misadventure"" since her first win and illness that stopped her from writing for most of 2010. ""Bring up the Bodies"" and ""Wolf Hall"" are being adapted into a six-part series for the BBC and stage plays. Mantel said she had turned down offers for movie adapations because she felt the plot was too complex and better suited to a television series. She is also at work on the third novel in her trilogy, which she plans to call, ""The Mirror and the Light."" ""When I start writing again, I will forget all this (the award ceremony) because every day has its own problems and every day you feel like a beginner.""

"(CNN) -- China is rallying around fallen hurdler Liu Xiang Wednesday after he failed to make it past the first-round heat for a second consecutive Olympics. The sympathetic response was a stark contrast to the public outcry over his high-profile withdrawal from the Beijing 2008 Games. Liu knocked over the first hurdle, injuring his right ankle and inflaming an Achilles tendon injury that ruined his medal ambitions at the 2008 Games. Liu then hopped on his left foot down the remainder of the track in a symbolic completion of the race, pausing to kiss the final hurdle. ""What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit,"" said Feng Shuyong, the leader of the Chinese athletics team, in quotes carried by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. ""Winning is not so important, participation is what matters."" ""We've all seen how hard it is for him. It is such a pity but his spirit is there,"" Feng continued. ""I think he made a lot of efforts over the past four years trying to do well. But in competitive sports, anything can happen."" ""Liu's spirit and sportsmanship won praise, not only from Chinese sport officials and millions of Chinese, but also from his foreign friends and opponents,"" wrote Xinhua. Local newspapers in cities across China carried Liu's story on their front pages, urging fans to support the athlete as he struggles to recover from injury. ""It is time for him to take a good rest,"" wrote the Chongqing Morning Post. On the Sina Weibo microblogging platform, where Liu Xiang was the top trending term Wednesday, the topic page for the Liu Xiang hashtag included the subheading: ""Liu Xiang fell and lost his chance to qualify for the semi-final. Write one sentence to comfort him."" All eyes in China were on Liu at the London Olympics Tuesday, as he sought to redeem himself after limping off the track at his first-round heat at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. The outpouring of sympathy toward Liu is a marked contrast to the sharp anger and widespread criticism lobbed at him at the Beijing Games. His abrupt withdrawal in what was China's most anticipated event brought his coach, fans, and reporters literally to tears in the stadium. Back then, Chinese fans denounced him as a ""coward"" who should have finished the match before quitting. Some complained that they had paid 20 times the retail price for tickets to see Liu compete in Beijing, and demanded a refund. China's sympathetic response this time around may be attributed to Liu's symbolic completion of the race, as well as the Olympics not taking place on Chinese home turf. At 29, Liu is also not expected to compete in another Olympics. The Shanghai native shot to international stardom when he won a gold medal in the 110-metre hurdles at the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics. His victory secured China its first men's track and field gold medal. After a 13-month recovery period, Liu returned to the track at the 2009 Shanghai Grand Prix, finishing in second place. He went on to place first in several 110-metre hurdles competitions, including the 2010 Asian Games, 2011 Asian Championships, and 2012 Diamond Leagues held in Oregon and Shanghai. His coach, Sun Haiping, told Xinhua on August 3 that Liu's Achilles tendon injury had flared up at his training camp in Germany ahead of the London Olympics, although he said they were confident it was under control. Liu also pulled out of the London Diamond League in London in July, citing back problems. Chinese media reported that Liu will undergo surgery for his Achilles tendon at a London hospital Wednesday. At 12.91 seconds, Liu's performance in Athens is the fastest 110-metre Olympic record to date. His performance of 12.88 seconds in 2006 IAAF Super Grand Prix is his personal best and the world's second-fastest record after Cuba's Dayron Robles. CNN's Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","China rallying around hurdler Liu Xiang after he failed to pass first-round heat .

"(CNN) -- Three years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, workers have dug up a massive chunk of weathered crude from the shallows off a Louisiana beach. The tar mat -- a slab of oil residue mixed with wet sand -- was about 165 feet long by 65 feet wide, said Lt. Cmdr. Natalie Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. It weighed more than 40,000 pounds, but more than 85% of that weight was sand, shells and water, she said. The mat was found under the surf off Isle Grand Terre, Louisiana, about 90 miles south of New Orleans. Crews using an excavator dug the largely submerged tar mat out of the beach in chunks over the last few weeks, Murphy said. Louisiana is the last state where regular cleanup operations from the oil spill are still under way. The Coast Guard and BP, the owner of the ruptured well at the heart of the disaster, declared the cleanup over in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi earlier this month, but more than 80 miles of the Louisiana coast are still being patrolled. BP has recovered more than 2.7 million pounds of waste from Louisiana shores in 2013, with residual oil making up between 5 and 15% of that total weight, company spokesman Jason Ryan told CNN. The drill rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in April 2010, killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher a mile beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the oil is believed to have evaporated or been consumed by microbes deep under water. But a still-undetermined portion settled to the floor of the Gulf, and some of it was stirred up and washed back ashore after Hurricane Isaac in 2012.","The slab of weathered crude and sand was more than 160 feet long .

"(CNN) -- California's top prosecutor will seek a change in an 1872 state law after an appeals court cited ""historical anomalies in the law"" when overturning a rape conviction of a man who allegedly pretended to be an 18-year-old woman's boyfriend in a dark bedroom. The appeals court ordered a retrial in the 2009 rape case. ""This law is arcane and I will work with the Legislature to fix it,"" Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said in a statement Friday. ""The evidence is clear that this case involved a nonconsensual assault that fits within the general understanding of what constitutes rape."" Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013 . This week, the California Court of Appeal overturned the rape conviction of Julio Morales, who was accused of raping an 18-year-old acquaintance after her boyfriend left the bedroom and she fell asleep. The court laid out the unusual circumstances of the case and problems in the 1872 law in the first paragraph of its ruling Wednesday: . ""A man enters the dark bedroom of an unmarried woman after seeing her boyfriend leave late at night, and has sexual intercourse with the woman while pretending to be the boyfriend,"" the court wrote. ""Has the man committed rape? ""Because of historical anomalies in the law and the statutory definition of rape, the answer is no, even though, if the woman had been married and the man had impersonated her husband, the answer would be yes,"" the court said. Debate over Violence Against Women Act centers on the vulnerable . Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Morales with rape of an unconscious woman under the 1872 law, the court said. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to three years. During the trial, the jury was instructed that ""[a] woman is unconscious of the nature of the act if she is unconscious or asleep or not aware that the act is occurring or not aware of the essential characteristics of the act because the perpetrator tricked, lied to, or concealed information from her."" The prosecutor argued correctly that the 18-year-old woman was asleep, but argued incorrectly that the woman wasn't aware of the act due to Morales' alleged deception about being her boyfriend, the court said. In conflicting testimony, the defendant testified at one point that he told the woman he wasn't her boyfriend, the court said. ""Because we cannot discern from this record whether the jury convicted defendant on the correct or incorrect theory, we must reverse,"" the court said. 'She could have been me': Action urged after Delhi gang rape case . ""We conclude that under the peculiar facts of this case, reversal is required because the prosecutor argued an incorrect theory of guilt, the instruction permitted the jury to convict on that theory, and the record does not permit us to find that the jury relied only on the prosecutor's correct theory,"" the court said. Morales' court-appointed attorney, Edward H. Schulman, said the retrial must omit the controversial instruction about an unconscious rape victim not being aware of ""the essential characteristics of the act because the perpetrator tricked, lied to, or concealed information from her."" The retrial would be Morales' third trial, Schulman told CNN. The first trial resulted in a hung jury, and the second convicted Morales, he said. Morales is now in his early 20s, the attorney said. State Assemblyman Katcho Achadjian said Friday that he will reintroduce legislation to close the loophole that resulted in the reversal. He first proposed such legislation last year after a woman in Santa Barbara County was raped in her bedroom. The woman first thought the attacker was her boyfriend and initially consented to sex. The county district attorney was unable to prosecute the man with felony rape. ""Californians are justifiably outraged by this court ruling, and it is important that the Legislature join together to close whatever loopholes may exist in the law and uphold justice for rape victims,"" Achadjian said of the Morales case.

"(CNN) -- On Monday, NBA player Jason Collins disclosed that he is gay, making him the first active openly homosexual athlete in the four major American pro team sports. His coming out has been the big sports story of the week and has lots of people talking -- CNN contributor Will Cain and Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe are no exception. Here's their discussion: . Will Cain: Chris, you, Brendon Ayanbadejo and Scott Fujita have done a noble job offering support to closeted gay NFL players. If I played in the NFL -- preferably for the Dallas Cowboys -- I would join you. A few months ago, you wrote a column on CNN.com laying out your position. I could not have joined you on that. I think you went too far when you said: . Players -- Those of you worried about a gay teammate checking out your ass in the shower, or hitting on you in the steam room, or bringing too much attention to the team -- I have four simple words for you. Grow the f*** up. I am a pro-gay marriage conservative. And I'm pretty damn confident in my sexuality. If we all get naked and go to brunch, I'm not going to be uncomfortable. But that's not a standard I expect of everyone. Yet, all of sudden, this seems to be the standard. Anyone uncomfortable sharing a locker room -- being naked -- with someone else who is potentially attracted to them is labeled ""afraid of gay people,"" insecure or a homophobe. This is what happened to former NBA player Larry Johnson this week when he tweeted: . I don't Jason Collins personally but he seems like a great guy. Me personally gay men in the locked room would make me uncomfortable . I think we're asking too much. Johnson's discomfort isn't illogical. And I bet he's hardly the only one who feels this way. Chris Kluwe: I would counter that with this -- there was a time when white men were uncomfortable showering with black men, or having them in the locker room. But as long as someone respects your personal space and doesn't harass you (verbally, physically or sexually), I fail to see what their sexuality, religion, race or personal beliefs have to do with any comfort or discomfort you might feel. Will: I don't think the black people-white people analogy is a good parallel. That was discomfort driven by racism. This is discomfort driven by potential sexual attraction. The better analogy is gender. Why do we have separate bathrooms for men and women? Chris: No, this is discomfort driven by sexism. Has there ever been a single reported case of sexual harassment in a professional sports environment by one player toward another? What makes you think that because all of a sudden a player is allowed to openly be himself that he's immediately going to start mounting every guy in sight? Isn't that the very definition of narcissistic tendencies by straight men who think that way? What makes you think you're that player's type, or that he would ever be attracted to you? One of the reasons we have separate bathrooms for women and men is because men have a long history of violent behavior toward women, particularly when they feel women are vulnerable. And so we have separated the sexes in those situations. Are you telling me that a professional athlete wouldn't be able to defend himself in the shower if a gay teammate suddenly decided, despite every single social norm we are raised with, that he was going to start humping his teammate's leg in a work environment? Will: No. I'm not telling you that. I'm not making any of the arguments you just blasted. You're right, one of the reasons we have separate men and women bathrooms is the potential for violence. But another reason is due to the discomfort of being checked out by someone who could be attracted to you. No honest straight man can say if he was put in a locker room full of naked ladies he wouldn't check out one, a few, or all of the women. It wouldn't be creepy, it wouldn't be deviant -- it would be normal. And no one would suggest in that situation: Get over yourselves ladies, don't be so narcissistic, your discomfort is your problem. The argument that I'm actually making is that potential sexual attraction creates a new dynamic in the locker room. And while it doesn't make me uncomfortable, I think it's absurd to say someone like Larry Johnson's discomfort is illogical. In the end, I don't have a solution to this problem. It isn't for players to live a lie and stay in the closet. But the lack of a solution doesn't require us to veer so far into political correctness to pretend there isn't a problem. Chris: But here's the thing. There have been gay athletes before. We know this because several of them have come out (Jason Collins while active, others after they were done playing). Simple statistics say there have to have been many others that never came out. And yet, somehow, there's never been a single reported incident of one athlete sexually assaulting another athlete, whether it's in the shower or anywhere else in the locker room. Essentially, what you're arguing is that because something that has never before happened in the entire history of professional sports might possibly maybe potentially happen if someone were to absolutely lose their mind and ignore every standard of decency and common behavior that we learn from a very young age, that we should force people to live a lie. I find I can live with the discomfort of people who can't wrap their minds around the idea that the world does not revolve around them. They can always shower somewhere else if it bugs them that much. I'll be in there dropping the soap, perfectly secure in the knowledge that I have a wife who loves me, whom I love back, and that there is an HR department in my organization I can turn to if something inappropriate were to occur. In fact, I'd probably be flattered if someone told me I looked good. I'm comfortable with who I am. Other people deserve the same chance. Will: No, again, that's not what I'm arguing. I didn't mention sexual harassment. I certainly didn't mention sexual assault. I did specifically mention ""living a lie"" and said no one should be forced to do that. I am only recognizing reality and human nature and observing that people will get checked out. Getting checked out would flatter you. It would flatter me. But I'm pretty sure it wouldn't flatter everyone. Take a quick poll of all the ladies you know about how they feel when they're ogled. Would they all feel flattered? I don't care if gay guys are in the locker room. I care about intellectual consistency. If people like Larry Johnson, who are uncomfortable, get labeled as homophobes ... then any ladies who have a problem with you in the locker room are prudes. Again, I don't care ... we can all meet up in the showers at the YWCA this afternoon. Or we become more understanding of other's discomfort. You get it one way or the other. Trying to split the difference is just politically correct emotionalism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Cain and Chris Kluwe.","Will Cain and Chris Kluwe debate having openly gay athletes in the locker room .

"(CNN) -- Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba did not respond to 15 defibrillator shocks and was in effect dead for 78 minutes before his heart started beating again, doctors who treated him have revealed. The 23-year-old has improved significantly since suffering a cardiac arrest during an English FA Cup match last Saturday but is still in intensive care with his condition described as serious. Muamba is responding appropriately to questions though, speaking in both French and English, and has been joking with some of his many visitors. Bolton's club doctor, Jonathan Tobin, spoke for the first time on Wednesday, talking reporters through the severity of Muamba's collapse and the frantic efforts made to save his life. Pinto: Is Muamba collapse a wake-up call for football? Tobin said he and the other paramedics who rushed onto the field treated Muamba for a total of 48 minutes on the pitch and en route to London's Chest Hospital, but it took a further 30 minutes to restart the midfielder's heart. ""In effect he was dead in that time,"" Dr. Tobin said. ""Fabrice was in a type of cardiac arrest where the heart is showing lots of electrical activity but no muscular activity. ""It's something that often responds to drugs and shocks. Now heaven knows why, but Fabrice had, in total, 15 shocks. He had a further 12 shocks in the ambulance."" Muamba's plight stunned players and supporters as the Congo-born star dropped to the floor with no-one near him just before halftime in the match. And Tobin explained the exasperation he felt as he sprinted onto the turf with the other medics on hand at the stadium, to try to save Muamba's life with 40,000 people looking on. ""I can't begin to explain the pressure that was there,"" he said. ""This isn't somebody that's gone down in the street or been brought into accident and emergency. Bolton manager has 'brief chat' with recovering Muamba . ""This is somebody that I know, I know his family. This is somebody I consider a friend. This is somebody I joke with on a daily basis. As I was running onto the pitch I was thinking 'Oh my God, it's Fabrice'."" The desperate effort to save Muamba was assisted by an off-duty cardiologist, who was in the stadium watching the game as a fan and was allowed onto the pitch. Dr. Andrew Deaner suggested Muamba be transferred to the London Chest Hospital, where he works, and administered vital drugs to the player in the ambulance. He says the fact Muamba is responding appropriately to questions and is able to make jokes within five days of suffering such major heart trauma is nothing short of astonishing. ""If you're going to use the term miraculous, I guess it could be used here,"" he said. Deaner also revealed he had been in to see Muamba a few hours after he woke up. 'Muamba collapse proves I was right to quit the game,' says ex pro . ""I whispered into his ear 'What's your name?',"" he explained. When Muamba said his name Deaner continued: ""I said 'I understand you're a very good footballer'. And he said 'I try.' ""He's made a remarkable recovery so far. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. As things stand, I think his life is not in danger at this time. His neurological function is looking very good but it is early days."" Meanwhile, Bolton will be back in action on Saturday after Muamba's family gave their blessing for the club to face rivals Blackburn Rovers in the English Premier League. Bolton's proposed league match with Aston Villa, scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed. ""We spoke together with the players as a group this morning and I talked with Fabrice's family last night,"" Bolton manager Owen Coyle told the club's website. ""Fabrice's father Marcel and his fiancÃ©e Shauna were keen that we fulfill our fixtures. Once the players knew this, there was no doubt in our minds that we would play the matches."" The FA Cup quarterfinal with Tottenham that was abandoned in the wake of Muamba's collapse, will be replayed on March 27 at White Hart Lane.","Doctors who treated Fabrice Muamba reveal soccer star was in effect dead for 78 minutes .

"London (CNN) -- A gossip magazine in Denmark on Saturday dismissed reports it had published new, even more revealing images of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, as entirely false. The publication of topless photographs of Catherine, taken with a long lens while she sunbathed while on vacation with Prince William in France, prompted anger and legal action from palace officials earlier this month. A number of media outlets in Britain and the United States reignited the controversy Friday when they reported that the Danish magazine, Se Og Hor, had printed fresh ""bottomless"" images of Britain's likely future queen -- that is, without her bikini briefs on. But the editor-in-chief of Se och Hoer, Kim Henningsen, dismissed the latest media reports as untrue rumors and told CNN the only images it had published were in one 16-page spread on September 20. Magazine fined for topless Kate photos . Those are from the same set of photos first seen in the French magazine Closer, then in an Italian magazine and an Irish newspaper, Henningsen said. They were also published in Sweden's Se och Hoer, a sister magazine to the Danish title. Defending the publication at the time, Henningsen said: ""It's a set of unique photos from an A-class celebrity. We are a leading gossip magazine in Denmark, and it is my job to publish them."" He added: ""If the British royal family want to sue us, then it will happen then and we'll deal with it."" The French Closer magazine was fined last week by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online. It was also told to hand over the photos to the royals within 24 hours.

"(CNN) -- Backed into a corner and desperate; That's the view of some economists watching the European Central Bank's latest attempts to curtail the euro bloc's recession. Thursday's interest rate cut, designed to combat a three-year debt crisis, will not stimulate economic growth in the bloc, they say. Less than a year after the ECB President Mario Draghi buoyed the markets with his promise to do ""whatever it takes"" to keep the currency together, the central bank's governors move has left some economists questioning whether the ECB has reached the limits of its power. Speaking in Bratislava, Slovakia, ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank is ""ready to act if needed."" But the Italian shied away from announcing any extraordinary policy measures such as another ""big bazooka"" to increase bank liquidity or the unlimited purchases of government debt -- known as OMTs -- for troubled eurozone nations that sparked controversy in September. Read more: The eurozone's reluctant leader . Joerg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology, told CNN that the rate cut is ""a desperate move,"" and means the ECB can avoid criticism that it is ""overstretching its mandate."" Despite the ECB's commitment to bankroll ailing eurozone nations who request a full sovereign bailout by buying up government bonds, it has so far resisted the temptation to implement aggressive monetary stimulus. That intransigence puts it at odds with many of its peers around the world. The Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have all embarked on a process of quantitative easing -- increasing the supply of money in the economy -- while also introducing other policies such as an unemployment benchmark and a funding for lending scheme, intended to encourage banks to loan to small businesses. Read more: Will `Abenomics' lift Japan from recession? Mujtaba Rahman, head of research firm Eurasia Group's Europe practice, said Draghi ""exhausted"" his political capital when he introduced the OMT program in September. Italian and Spanish bonds, which had been been weighed down by market uncertainty, rebounded. Rahman added the ECB may be reluctant to announce new support measures because it breeds inertia among politicians looking to push through changes, such as a banking union, needed to bring Europe closer together. He said: ""The wind has gone out of the sails on banking union. Once you announce intervention, you remove the incentive for countries to put the necessary structures in place."" He told CNN that ""shovelling money"" to small businesses in peripheral Europe is the most likely next step for the ECB, but says the German elections and legality of the ECB's current bond-purchasing program are obstacles to any extraordinary policy announcements in future. With the worst hit countries in Europe in a depression and unemployment rising, the ECB could be forced to take more action, in addition to the current measures, to prevent the crisis worsening. Greece and Spain are both suffering with unemployment above 27% while Italy is drowning in a government debt of almost 2 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion), according to Eurostat -- the European Commission's data service. Read more: May Day protesters flood streets of Europe . Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank -- Germany's second-largest bank -- would expect the ECB to cut the deposit rate to negative territory before putting in place any other non-standard measures such as a loan scheme for small businesses. He said that the central bank is ""in a corner"" and has already exceeded its mandate significantly. Peripheral countries must stop expecting the ECB to come up with solutions to problems that should be solved by governments, he added. ""We are already seeing drastic action,"" Kraemer told CNN, ""the ECB has a very expansionary monetary policy, which I personally think, is too expansionary."" He added: ""This immediately puts the reform pressure off the peripheral countries and especially Italy. Without far reaching reforms you don't solve the reasons and the causes for the sovereign debt crisis.""","Speaking in Bratislava, Slovakia, ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank is ""ready to act if needed.""

"(CNN) -- BP has said it hopes to have a relief well in place in August to permanently cut off the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. The company has said the operation is the best sure-fire way of plugging the massive oil leak. A relief well is a well drilled into the existing well, intercepting the flow and allowing a specialized heavy liquid to be pumped into the flowing well to bring it under control. BP began drilling the first relief well on May 2 and started drilling a second one two weeks later. The wells are being dug to a depth of about 18,000 feet, just above the oil reservoir. Once one hits the original pipe, just 7 inches in diameter, drilling mud will be shot into it to stop the spewing oil. Cement will then be used to permanently seal it. The second relief well is part of a contingency plan in case the first well encounters any delays. Relief wells have been used to plug two other large blowout spills. In 1979, it took nearly 10 months to seal the world's largest spill in Mexico's Bay of Campeche. More recently, an Australian accident last year known as the Montara spill, was plugged after nearly four months. In both cases, efforts such as those used to try to stop the Deepwater Horizon spill -- containment domes and junk shots -- were fruitless. And it took multiple tries before the relief wells reached the original wells.","Relief wells may be used to stop oil gushing into Gulf .

"(CNN) -- Hamdeen Sabahy, a leftist dark-horse candidate for Egypt's presidency, is a passionate proponent for the teeming nation's poor and an ideological devotee of the late firebrand nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. ""I am the president of the poor,"" Sabahy told Reuters. ""I want to bring justice to those who were wrong for so long."" ""My campaign is for all Egyptians and especially a campaign for the poor and the alleviation of the struggle between classes,' he said, according to the MidEast News Source. ""As a new president for a new Egypt, my first decision will be a quick rise in salaries for most of the working citizens, either in the public or private sectors, and also aid for poor people the very first moment I am in the (presidential) palace."" Egyptians head to the polls beginning Wednesday for historic elections -- the first democratic vote since President Hosni Mubarak was forced from power early last year. The charismatic candidate has unique popularity. He's neither an Islamist nor a status-quo candidate. And, he's the most viable candidate for idealists, liberals and revolutionaries who turned out in Tahrir Square to protest the rule and help bring about the end of Mubarak's rule. Sabahy identifies greatly with the revered Nasser, an Arab world hero whose nationalist and populist rhetoric reverberated on the impoverished streets of Cairo and other towns in the 1950s and 1960s. Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy, touted and implemented socialist reforms, supported pan-Arab nationalism, and led a losing fight against Israel in the Six Day War. Sabahy was born in the small town of Baltim and lived in a working-class environment there. He first got involved in politics during his student days at Cairo University, where he expressed full-throated displeasure with Anwar Sadat, Nasser's successor. He also opposed Mubarak, who became president after Sadat was assassinated. Over the years, he has been imprisoned for his activities. A longtime veteran Nasserist politician and a former member of the Egyptian parliament's lower house, Sabahy is now leader and founder of the Dignity Party. His stirring message of economic justice, accompanied on the campaign trail by Nasserite nationalist tunes, has been well-received by citizens across society -- organized labor, youth and rights groups, academics and public figures. One prominent supporter is noted writer Alaa El-Aswany. Another is the mother of Khalid Said -- the man beaten to death by police in Alexandria two years ago. That fatality has since become a lightning rod for human rights activists. His campaign style is described in a McClatchy newspaper report as ""a mesmerizing force, pressing hands with Egyptians who are so accustomed to neglect from the political elites that they follow him in crowds, through trash-strewn alleyways, slack-jawed as he asks about the price of tomatoes."" ""He is our protector,"" said Mohamed Mowafi, a Baltim electric company worker. ""We trust Sabahy... he's always among us and serving us. Even when he was a member of parliament, he remained here with us."" Sabahy has been critical of Egypt's relationship with Israel, even though he said he's not going to take on the Camp David peace treaty between the countries. McClatchy quoted Sabahy as saying he would stop ""pampering Israel"" and that he's supportive of funding Palestinian ""resistance"" groups . ""Everything besides the peace treaty is subject to change. Israel will not enjoy the exceptional privileges it was granted before,"" Sabahy told McClatchy. ""I am not Hosni Mubarak, who paid the price of pleasing Washington through Tel Aviv."" The Middle East Media Research Institute -- which monitors, translates, and studies Arab, Iranian and Turkish media, schoolbooks, and religious sermons -- translated a 2005 TV interview with him espousing violence against the United States in Iraq. ""When a weapon is pointed at the Americans, it is good,"" he said. ""Any kidnapping or slaughtering of an American in Iraq is good."" He called al Qaeda in Iraq, the militant group that conducted attacks against U.S. troops and Iraqi forces, a ""resistance"" group and a ""positive phenomenon."" Speaking in the interview on Dream 2 TV, Sabahy said, ""one must salute this organization (al Qaeda) when it kills any American soldier -- soldier, not a civilian."" In the present day, he has opposed an amnesty deal for military rulers if they face charges after they leave power. ""I have no option but putting anyone who participated in the killings and attacks on protesters to fair trial, even if those are members of the ruling military council,"" Sabahy told McClatchy. ""That's what I call the 'fair exit' for the military rulers, not the 'safe exit' as some other candidates may have proposed."" Sabahy's backers say their man has touched a chord with the masses and hope he gains momentum at the polls. Aswat Masriya, a news outlet, quotes Amr Helmy, former minister of health, as saying ""Sabahy has been a true revolutionary since his college years, he also has a detailed program that has room for all types of Egyptians."" Abdel Haleem Kandil, a prominent columnist, said he decided to cast a ballot for Sabahy after hearing him talk ""about peasants and workers with details that shows he has a direct relation with them, something that no other candidate has."" CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report .","Sabahy is a longtime champion of Gamal Abdel Nasser .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia downplayed reports of personal and ideological rifts stemming from the recent landmark health care reform ruling, telling CNN in an exclusive interview ""it offends me"" to hear criticism of his colleagues over how they ruled. The 76-year-old justice talked Wednesday with CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" discussing a range of judicial topics -- from the death penalty to abortion rights and the Bush v. Gore decision. Scalia, along with Bryan Garner, is co-author of a new book, ""Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts."" The men describe their legal philosophy, and how to make sense of the law and the U.S. Constitution. They call their approach ""textualism."" Even in dissent, Scalia stirs controversy . Scalia would not specifically address the health care decision or other recent or current case issues, such as immigration enforcement, affirmative action or gay marriage. And he would not discuss how the court reached its health care ruling in internal deliberations. But the conservative justice downplayed media reports of personal fallout from opposing conservative and liberal members of the court over the 5-4 decision three weeks ago. Scalia was on the losing side of the ruling upholding the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping legislation championed by President Barack Obama. Chief Justice John Roberts was the deciding vote in that decision, agreeing with his liberal colleagues to uphold the individual mandate, which would financially punish people who do not purchase health insurance. Some media and blog reports -- citing sources with specific knowledge of the deliberation process -- suggested strong tensions among the court's conservatives over Roberts' vote, which some commentators perceived as political expediency. But Scalia said it was wrong to question Roberts or other court members personally for their legal conclusions. ""We are not a political institution,"" Scalia said. ""I don't think any of my colleagues on any cases vote the way they do for political reasons."" Scalia added he was dismayed at the criticism of Roberts, suggesting those who may have leaked information were not entirely privy to the internal discussions over the health care decision. On abortion, Scalia said the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing the medical procedure should be overturned, believing it remains an issue best left for states to decide. No matter what it does, high court is seen as political . The court doesn't do democracy any favors by getting involved in the abortion debate in such a way, according to Scalia. Likewise with capital punishment, Scalia said the issue is not whether the court should ultimately decide whether there should still be a death penalty -- he claimed not to have an opinion on that -- but rather whether individual states should decide such a question. ""If you don't like the death penalty, fine, change the law,"" he said. ""I'm not 'pro' death penalty, I'm 'anti' the idea that is not ultimately a democratic choice."" But he emphasized capital punishment has been around since the nation's founding and was well-established in law and social tradition. And Scalia reiterated his firm views over what he agreed was the most talked-about recent court decision -- the 2000 ruling effectively handing the presidency to George W. Bush after the Florida ballot recounts. ""Get over it,"" he said about supporters of Al Gore, many of whom are still convinced the case was wrongly decided in favor of the Republican. ""He (Gore) would have lost anyway if all the ballots were recounted."" In his new book, Scalia argues interpreting laws and the Constitution properly requires a strict approach to look at the actual text of the law itself. He warns that squishy, unprincipled decision-making is bad for the country and for the reputation of judges themselves. ""The descent into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely traceable to nontextual means of interpretation, which erodes society's confidence in a rule of law that evidently has no agreed-upon meaning,"" write Scalia and Garner. The jaunty jurist has long been able to light up, or ignite, a room with his often brash demeanor and wicked sense of humor, and he displayed that in the hourlong conversation with Morgan. Despite his reputation as an intellectual fighter, Scalia described himself as ""a peaceful man."" When asked if he had ever broken the law, the justice said, ""I've had a few speeding tickets, though none recently."" His outgoing personality and sharply written opinions have made him among the most recognizable of justices, and a particular favorite of conservative activists, scholars and lawmakers. President Ronald Reagan named Scalia to the high court in 1986 after previous jobs as an appeals court judge, a government and private lawyer, and a law professor. Justices finances show overseas travel, book royalties, gifts . ""At one extreme, he can alienate some of his colleagues,"" said Joan Biskupic, legal affairs editor at Reuters, who has written a biography of Scalia. ""If he is trying to get anybody to sign an opinion, it was harder when he would use more combative language. But as much as they would say 'I'd like to strangle Nino,' he was still theirs in many ways."" That harshness was evident in the closing days of the term ending in June. On two issues that left Scalia on the losing side -- health care and immigration enforcement -- he displayed the fierce rhetoric that has become his trademark. Scalia, writing for the minority, argued the court's ruling favoring federal authority over immigration matters encroaches on Arizona's sovereign powers. ""If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign State."" ""He can be belligerent; he is obviously very candid about how he feels,"" Biskupic said. ""He loves to call it as he sees it, completely not politically correct. In fact, he prides himself on not being PC on the bench, in court."" Many legal scholars say Scalia ultimately failed to sway his colleagues on the really big constitutional issues, and court sources say he has grown somewhat frustrated over the years being on the losing side of many cases, or not being able to write more majority opinions. Antonin Gregory Scalia was born in 1936 and admitted to being the center of attention as the only child, doted on by his father, a Sicilian-born professor of romance languages, and his mother, a schoolteacher. They instilled a love of learning and the confidence to exercise his intellectual muscles. He attended Georgetown University as an undergrad, and later Harvard Law School, where he met his future wife, Maureen McCarthy, who was attending nearby Radcliffe. They raised nine children, including a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, and a priest. The family is united by a strong Catholic faith. When asked about his greatest achievement as a judge, Scalia went back to the foundation of his book. He said he hoped he has moved his colleagues toward a more textured view of the law. ""The court pays more attention now to the text"" of the law and the Constitution, he said, and less to legislative history, congressional floor debates and the views of foreign governments. For a lover of language, the precise meaning of words contained in the law has been his goal. And he has no plans to step down anytime soon. ""Of course, I'll retire when I start to realize I'm not doing as good a job as I should,"" he said, adding he still thinks he is fully engaged. Taking a look at Scalia's influence, defiance .

"(CNN) -- When Bono wrote the song ""Walk On,"" he probably wasn't foreshadowing wandering the streets of Canada at the mercy of a passers-by. But that's where the legendary U2 singer found himself Tuesday, stuck on the side of the road near Vancouver, his thumb extended in hopes of catching a lift. His chariot arrived in the form of a ride that brought him to his destination and turned the self-described rugby player on to Canada's favorite sport. ""I like ice hockey, because people who play ice hockey are the kind of people who pick up hitchhikers,"" Bono told a concert crowd Wednesday in Edmonton, Alberta, as seen in a video posted on YouTube. ""I know this from personal experience."" Bono and his assistant were out for a walk when, according to numerous reports, it started to rain. The U2 frontman/hitchhiker said that Edmonton Oilers player Gilbert Brule and his girlfriend were driving in a truck when they spotted the forlorn traveler. Kelsey Nichols told CNN affiliate CTV, that she didn't believe her boyfriend, Brule, that the hitchhiker was Bono. ""I said no, we're not picking up a hitchhiker. We're going to die,"" she said later, with a smile. ""There's no way."" But Nichols, who was driving, changed her mind and turned around. According to the Edmonton Sun, the couple had set out for a local park to walk their German Shepherd -- a dog that eventually shared space in the back of the truck with the singer and his assistant. ""He was very cool,"" Bono said of Brule, describing him as a ""very modest man."" ""He said, 'Where do you want to go?' And I said, 'Just take me to where The Edge is'"" -- a reference to U2's well-known guitarist. During his Edmonton show Wednesday, Bono said that he had decided ""that I now want to be Gilbert Brule,"" a five-year NHL veteran center who scored seven goals in 41 games last season with the Oilers. He then went on to cast his bandmates as other members of the Oilers' franchise, dating to its 1980s heyday as a juggernaut on ice. The lead singer decreed that Larry Mullen, U2's drummer, would be Mark Messier, who won five Stanley Cups with Edmonton and another with the New York Rangers. Bassist Adam Clayton was dubbed Grant Fuhr, in honor of the famed ex-Oilers' goalie. As to The Edge -- who was born as David Evans -- ""he's kind of the Great One,"" Bono decided in casting him as nine-time league MVP, Wayne Gretzky. Brule, who flew from Vancouver to Edmonton so he could go backstage at Wednesday's concert, told CTV that he was ""star struck"" upon meeting the rock star and taking him to Horseshoe Bay. ""I couldn't believe he said that,"" said Brule of Bono's gushing praise. ""That was insane -- I think I want to be him.""","NEW: Gilbert Brule says it's ""insane"" that Bono said he wanted to be the hockey player .

"(CNN) -- A growing number of women in business are flocking to Twitter for real-time advice, support and networking. Twitter chats are allowing women in the world of work -- from young business owners to females in the C-suite to mompreneurs and more -- to gather together online and talk like never before. Here is Leading Women's guide to Twitter chats -- the benefits, the pitfalls, some contacts and how to get involved. What is a Twitter chat? When it comes to Twitter chats there are as many topics as groups, from customer service to tech enthusiasts to business start-ups, and although women are using them a lot, it's not gender specific. A chat happens when a group of Twitter users gathers together at a scheduled time, and send tweets to each other using an agreed hashtag that allows anyone who's interested to follow the conversation. They tend to happen regularly, for example monthly, and a community will of like-minded people often grows up around them. An organizer will tweet the date, time and topic of the chat to the community using the hashtag. The organizer will often use a social media dashboard like Tweetdeck or Hootsuite to schedule questions that will be tweeted out at intervals during the chat to give the conversation structure. Tinu Abayomi-Paul, editor of of the #WgBiz (Women Grow Business) chat describes a successful chat as ""a lively community around the chat's topic, consistent promotion, well-timed, scheduled chats, and discussion around a topic that the community cares about."" Why are they popular? Twitter chats have become a practical communicative tool for a number of reasons, according to Abayomi-Paul. ""First, there's the chance to receive expert or peer knowledge in a format that's more dynamic than a webinar,"" she said. ""Second, there's an avenue for continuing to maintain contact with those participating via Twitter, without anyone exposing their private information before they're ready. ""Third, being able to participate live, in real time, in such a (simple) format eliminates some of the barriers that keep us from attending teleconferences, webinars, video meeting or in-person events."" Twitter chats are also a flexible way to communicate, according to Young Female Entrepeneur chat organizer Jennifer Donogh. ""You can join in whenever you can, wherever you are, which is very important for young women especially those with varied responsibilities,"" she said. Some chats also provide the opportunity to meet and talk directly with industry experts. Avid chat participant Ify Ofulue uses chats to brainstorm with guest speakers and says it is an immeasurable source of knowledge. ""The caliber of guests is a huge draw,"" she said. ""I knew straight away I wouldn't have had the opportunity to connect with them as easily as through Twitter chat. So, I threw caution to the wind and dove in. It quickly became a monthly routine."" Connecting with like-minded individuals within your industry has always been important in business. Viveka von Rosen is the founder of Linked Into Business. She highlights how tweet chats have created a new avenue for networking professionals. ""The business and relationship development opportunities for participants are incredible,"" she said. ""The fact that people get to hang out with influencers that the moderators bring on and for these major influencers to be able share their words with people so directly, I think that kind of access is unparalleled."" What are the disadvantages? While chats are growing in popularity, von Rosen is quick to point out Twitter could be doing more to help. ""It can be difficult to find tweet chats, it's like a secret club or something,"" she said. ""There is an excel list that gets passed around (but) I think Twitter is missing out on an incredible opportunity when it comes to tweet chats."" Another disadvantage, according to chat enthusiast and marketing professional Shannon Renee, is when people hijack an event to promote their own products and services and thus devaluing the conversation. How to get involved . Both moderators and participants describe Twitter chats as friendly and welcoming experiences. If you'd like to get involved, here are a few hints to help you on your way: . 1. Search your favorite blog or website and see what Twitter activity they have or if they use a certain hashtag to generate conversation between members. 2. Ask your followers and friends if they participate in any chats that may be of interest to you. 3. Once started Twitter chats gain momentum and it can be difficult to keep up with the conversation. Using a tool like Tweetdeck or Tweetchat to follow the hashtag can help. 4. There is nothing wrong with sitting on the sidelines and watching the discussion as it happens. 5. If you want to speak up, moderators suggest sending an introductory tweet to the group mentioning that it's your first chat.","Twitter chats have gained momentous popularity over the last few years .

"Paju, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea held a huge military parade in Pyongyang on Thursday, using the 70th anniversary of the birth of its late leader Kim Jong Il as an opportunity to try to invoke deeper reverence for his son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un. State television broadcast footage of the younger Kim and senior officials from the secretive regime on a platform overlooking a square filled with thousands of people. The platform was bedecked with Kimjongilias, the brilliant pink flower named after the dead leader. With a giant portrait of a smiling Kim Jong Il, who died in December, looking down on proceedings, soldiers carried out a salute to him and his father, Kim Il Sung, who founded North Korea. The soldiers paid ""high respects"" to the two deceased Kims and pledged loyalty to Kim Jong Un, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. In South Korea, two dozen North Korean defectors met in a park to release balloons carrying criticism of Kim Jong Il over the heavily militarized border that separates the two countries, a move that has irritated Pyongyang in the past. Thursday is the first of two big occasions in the early months of 2012 for the nuclear-armed North Korean regime to eulogize former dictators and reinforce the position of its young new leader. The 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, who ruled North Korea for almost half a decade, takes place on April 15. The date of his birth, known as ""the Day of the Sun,"" is the biggest national holiday in North Korea. Kim Jong Il's birthday was recently dubbed ""the Day of the Shining Star."" The significant anniversaries come soon after Kim Jong Un, who is thought to be in his late 20s, was elevated to the position of ""supreme leader"" of the insular state. North Korean newspapers on Thursday carried special reports on Kim Jong Il. Before the parade began airing, Korean Central Television (KCTV), the government-run news broadcaster, showed chorus groups singing lyrics in praise of him, as well as images from his life. And state-run media have already documented a number of events and initiatives that took place ahead of the anniversary of his birth. Kim Jong Un and other senior officials attended a ""national meeting"" Wednesday to commemorate the occasion, according to KCNA. Kim Yong Nam, the president of the North Korean parliament, made a speech at the event praising Kim Jong Il's ""immortal feats"" and also urging that ""all the party members, service persons and people should protect Kim Jong Un politically and ideologically with their lives and get united around him."" Other recent measures related to Kim Jong Il's birthday reported by state media include an ice sculpture festival held by public security forces and the delivery of gifts to children across the country, in some cases by helicopter. Pyongyang has warned South Korea and other countries not to expect any change in its policies under Kim Jong Un. It has kept up its criticism of the current South Korean government of President Lee Myung-bak. The United States said Monday that a U.S. envoy will meet with North Korean officials next week to test Pyongyang's stance on its nuclear program. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Glyn Davies will meet with his counterpart, North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, in Beijing . The North Korean regime's willingness to talk to Washington but not Seoul has been criticized in South Korea. ""Two months after a leadership change in Pyongyang, North Korea is returning to the dialogue table,"" The Korea Times, an English-language daily, said in an editorial Thursday. ""That's good news. Not so good news is it seems to be interested only in its conversation partner across the Pacific, not across the inter-Korean border."" The North Korean defectors in the park in Paju sent balloons Thursday carrying leaflets that called on the North Korean people to rise up and fight. The large helium balloons had writing on them, saying things like, ""Kim Jong Il starved to death 3 million people,"" ""Liberate the North Korean people"" and ""North Korean killer Kim Jong Il."" They sent 200,000 leaflets, 500 DVDs and $1,000 in one dollar bills. CNN's Paula Hancocks, Jethro Mullen and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","NEW: State television shows a large military parade in Pyongyang .

"(CNN) -- ""And there we were ..."" That phrase begins many stories told by wildland firefighters. ""We thought we had it knocked down."" ""It got up into the trees."" ""Suddenly, fire was everywhere."" Fire falling and bouncing and pouring like lava down mountainsides. Fire exploding into tree crowns and launching a thousand bright brands. Fire taking your breath and replacing it with fire. Or at least that's what if feels like during a blow-up. Of course, fire stories like those are told by the living. On Sunday in Arizona, 19 Granite Mountain hotshots battling the Yarnell Fire lost their lives when things got bad too fast. Their story is now being pieced together out of the ashes by those who were not there with them. And there they were. ... But why were they there? Why were 19 men who were so full of life so drawn to this dangerous occupation? Remembering the firefighters . I started on a Montana hotshot crew years ago and worked 12 fire seasons as a Forest Service smokejumper, parachuting to fight wildfires in the West and Alaska. It was hard work and high adventure -- the best job I've ever had, the best people with whom I've worked. Like the Yarnell hotshots, we charged toward the fires, lugging heavy packs and swinging heavy tools, digging firelines and felling trees, separating the fuels from the fires. My first jump fire was a two-manner, high on Mogollon Baldy Peak in New Mexico. Roger Mello and I fought a small lightning fire, until another huge bolt exploded a ponderosa pine tree right below us in a blast so bright that I saw its afterimage for an entire minute. We put out that fire and then were helicoptered out, to land in front of magnificent and ancient cliff dwellings. I was hooked, just like thousands of other wildland firefighters. There were always close calls. In Alaska, with a fire pressing us, we built an island of rocks out in a small lake and stood on it to let the fire blow past us. On another fire call, our Twin Beech crash-landed on the edge of the Yukon River. We squeezed out through a wing window as the plane began to burn. In Idaho's River of No Return Wilderness, with the fire heating up below us, we sawed down a dead tree and used its trunk as a battering ram to bust up a granite reef and build a helicopter landing pad. Of course, we should not have been up on that ridge top with the fire cooking below us. The phrase, ""And there we were ..."" whispers the cause of almost every firefighting fatality. Firefighters sometimes go -- and sometimes they are sent -- where they should never have gone. Norman Maclean's famous book, ""Young Men and Fire,"" about the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire incident, which took 13 smoke jumpers' lives, reads like a classic Greek tragedy, complete with lessons of hubris and fate. Nonfirefighters often love that book. But firefighters will read it and shake their heads. All we can think is that they shouldn't have gone down there. Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . Firefighting deaths are never classical tragedies. However, those who perish fighting fires are indeed heroes. Their last moments are pinnacles of high emotion and drama. Hold your breath and imagine it. In 1994, a fire crew was caught on Colorado's Storm King Mountain by a fire flashing up through brush that had already burned once. Some sheltered. Some ran. Two made it out over the ridgetop. When rescuers arrived, they found a surreal scene. The bodies they found lower on the slope were burned beyond recognition. Those they found higher had been caught in a blast that was extreme but brief. Their bodies appeared as though they had been bronzed. They looked like Rodin statues, cast in their last moments of heroic, doomed struggle. There they were. And there the Yarnell 19 were, on their Arizona fire last Sunday where they should not have been. And yet they were so right to want to be there. They were more alive than most of us are, more vital, more committed and more sincere in their lives. They fought fire to protect others' lives and property. They shouldered the burden and faced the dangers. As heroes do. God bless the Yarnell 19. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clay Morgan.","Clay Morgan: ""And there they were ..."" begins stories about firefighters like the Yarnell 19 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Li Keqiang on Friday was named China's premier, the No. 2 position in the Chinese government, completing the once-a-decade transition of leadership in the world's most populous nation. He replaces Wen Jiabao. Li rose to the position at the nation's annual parliamentary gathering, which a day earlier named Xi Jinping as China's new president. He was the sole candidate. The vote was largely a rubber stamp that completes the highly choreographed leadership transition which started in November, which saw the traditionally nine-member Politburo Standing Committee shrink to seven. Four months after taking over as General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi replaced outgoing leader Hu Jintao Thursday after a formal vote of about 3,000 deputies at the National People's Congress (NPC). Xi was also named chairman of the state Central Military Commission. ""He has had a stronger military relationship than either of his two predecessors -- Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao -- when they began, so Xi comes in with a really strong position and he needs it,"" Robert Lawrence Kuhn, author of ""How China's Leaders Think,"" told CNN. ""We could go through a whole list of problems from the structure of the economy as well as the social issues: Health care, housing, education and pollution and retirement and food safety,"" Kuhn added. ""All of these things are all bubbling up together -- and with a billion cell phones in China, everybody knows it, so he's on the spot."" Opening the NPC last week, Wen urged delegates to ""unite as one and work hard to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" according to state-run news agency Xinhua. PROFILES: China's new leaders . Since the congress convened March 5, thousands of Chinese officials have held a series of meetings to discuss the structure of state departments and future targets. The NPC concludes Sunday. Goals set out for China, now the world's second largest economy, during the NPC included an annual growth rate this year of 7.5%. Efforts would be made to keep consumer price inflation at around 3.5%. And, nine million new jobs would be created with the intention of keeping urban unemployment at no more than 4.6%. Beijing announced during the NPC it would strengthen the powers of the State Food and Drug Administration in the wake of widespread health concerns over food safety, such as tainted milk and baby formula scandals, according to Xinhua. The issue of water quality also became clear during the congress, with the discovery of nearly 6,000 dead pigs in a Shanghai river, raising local concerns about the safety of the city's drinking water. This winter has seen its worst pollution in living memory, angering a population already jaded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals -- including the downfall of the once high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- that have tainted the reputation of the party. In a speech published by the People's Daily earlier this month, Xi warned that China faced many risks and challenges, saying that the party's future was at stake. The NPC also approved the restructuring of several ministries under the State Council. The two agencies that regulate and censor media -- the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television and the General Administration of Press and Publication -- will be merged, as will the Health Ministry and the National Population and Family Planning Commission, Xinhua reported. CNN's Kevin Voigt and Katie Hunt contributed to this story .","Li Keqiang was named China's premier, the No. 2 position .

"(CNN) -- Chris Stevens died in the service of his country. He died doing what he loved most -- working to build bridges of understanding and mutual respect between the people of the United States and the people of the Middle East and North Africa. He was loved by many more Libyans than those who hated him for being an American. A few dozen fanatics penetrated his compound. More than 30,000 people in Benghazi demonstrated in protest over his death. Chris was successful because he embodied the traits that have always endeared America to the world -- a commitment to democratic principles, and respect for others, regardless of race, religion or culture. Chris regarded and liked each person he met as an individual. He respected their views, whether or not he agreed. One of his friends told us a tale that reflects his success on a small scale. Picnicking in the Libyan countryside, they met a local family. Chris immediately greeted them and suggested that they be photographed together. The young son of the patriarch of the family, suspicious and negative toward Americans, refused to participate. So Chris continued chatting with the others. When it was time to leave, the initially suspicious son presented Chris with a bouquet of flowers. ""This is because you were so respectful to my father,"" he said. Chris was not willing to be the kind of diplomat who would strut around in fortified compounds. He amazed and impressed the Libyans by walking the streets with the lightest of escorts, sitting in sidewalk cafes, chatting with passers-by. There was a risk to being accessible. He knew it, and he accepted it. What Chris never would have accepted was the idea that his death would be used for political purposes. There were security shortcomings, no doubt. Both internal and outside investigations have identified and publicly disclosed them. Steps are being taken to prevent their reoccurrence. Chris would not have wanted to be remembered as a victim. Chris knew, and accepted, that he was working under dangerous circumstances. He did so -- just as so many of our diplomatic and development professionals do every day -- because he believed the work was vitally important. He would have wanted the critical work he was doing to build bridges of mutual understanding and respect -- the kind of work that made him literally thousands of friends and admirers across the broader Middle East -- to continue. So rather than engage in endless recriminations, his family is working to continue building the bridges he so successfully began. Through the J. Christopher Stevens Fund, and thanks to the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world, including a generous contribution from the government of Libya, the family of Christopher Stevens is working to support programs that build bridges between the people of the United States and the broader Middle East. This fall, together with a coalition of public and private partners, the family will launch a Virtual Exchange Initiative that will fuel the largest ever increase in people-to-people exchanges between the United States and the broader Middle East. We are working with the Peace Corps to expand its reach into schools and communities across this country. The family will support university fellowships for promising students interested in foreign relations and the Middle East, and looks forward to a symposium on ""The Arab Spring and the Future of U.S. Diplomacy"" planned in Chris' honor by the University of California's Hastings College of the Law.Â . We have received letters from thousands of people all over the world who were touched by his example. His openness touched a chord in their hearts. He would have wanted to be remembered for that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of Jan Stevens.","Chris Stevens' father writes that his son knew the risks of his job .

"Washington (CNN) -- OK. The budget deficit, the debt ceiling, and tax reform are givens. We know that those battles will continue to be in the political spotlight throughout 2013. But what else will be front and center in the New Year? By the Numbers: Politics in 2013 . Here are five other things to keep your eyes on: . 1. Gun control: The shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, have moved gun control to the top of the ""to do"" list for the White House and many in Congress. While past mass killings have stirred talk of gun control, the killing of 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School by a man armed with a semi-automatic rifle seems to have changed public opinion. ""A discussion has reemerged as to what we might do not only to deter mass mass shootings in the future but to reduce the epidemic of gun violence that plagues this country every single day and it's encouraging that people of all different backgrounds and beliefs and political persuasions have been willing to challenge some old assumptions and change long-standing positions. That conversation has to continue but this time, the words need to lead to action,"" said the president, vowing to take action. Obama: Proposals to address gun violence due by January . The president tapped Vice President Joe Biden to head a task force to report back in a month on ways to prevent future mass shootings. ""This is not some Washington commission. This is not something where folks are gonna be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside. This is a team that has a very specific task to pull together real reforms right now,"" added the president. Obama: 'Something fundamental in America has to change' While there's action Obama can take through executive orders, the big question centers on what Congress will do and whether lawmakers will buck the National Rifle Association and push through new gun control measures early in 2013. 2. Immigration reform: It may take a slight back seat due to the elementary school shootings and the new emphasis by the White House on gun control, but add illegal immigration reform to Obama's ""to do"" list in 2013. At a news conference in November soon after his re-election, the president said that he expected an immigration reform bill would be introduced soon after his inauguration, adding that ""we need to seize the moment."" Five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform . Obama told reporters that he hoped for a comprehensive bill that would include border security, enforcement measures for companies that employ undocumented workers, and resolving the status of the 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States. ""I am very confident we can get immigration reform done,"" added the president. And this time around, he may have support from some Republican lawmakers, who acknowledge that after their crushing defeat by the president among Latino voters in the November election (National exit polls indicate the president captured more than 70% of the Latino vote), it's time for the GOP to consider compromise on the issue of immigration reform. 3. Future of the GOP: As Republicans try to rebound from a disappointing 2012 election, where they failed to pick up the White House or win back the Senate, there seem to be two game plans. Some in the GOP have called for a ""bigger tent"" party that would be more representative and inclusive of the changing demographics of American voters. Others say moderating is the wrong way to go, and that the party needs to stay true to its conservative roots. How this discussion plays out in 2013 and beyond will be fascinating to watch. Opinion: What the tea party cost the GOP . Short term, keep your eyes on the Republican National Committee as it completes its comprehensive look at what went right, wrong, and what to fix. ""In order to get back in the game, you've got to look at and do a full autopsy of what happened,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus told CNN about a month ago. We could see some recommendations from the report start to surface in late January, when the party committee holds its annual meeting in Charlotte. 4. Campaign politics: Who says there's no real action on the campaign trail the year after a presidential election? We've always got gubernatorial elections to watch in New Jersey and Virginia the year after the race for the White House. And both should be very interesting this time. Virginia is shaping up to be a battle between Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a tea party-backed and controversial conservative, and Terry McAuliffe, the often outspoken former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The New Jersey race may not be as riveting now that Newark's Democratic Mayor Corey Booker decided against a bid. But the fact that the Republican candidate is the tough talking popular governor, Chris Christie, means that we'll have a full year of watching him on the campaign trail and a full year to wonder if his re-election bid is just a warm up act for a 2016 attempt at higher office. Two high-profile governors races ensure 2013 won't be quiet year . But wait, there's more. Thanks to the president's nomination of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, it looks like we'll have a special election in June 2013 to fill the final year and a half of Kerry's term. And that could give outgoing Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who was just defeated in the November election, a chance to return to the Senate. Meanwhile, three Democratic congressmen are already making moves to run for Kerry's seat. All the action up in Boston will draw national attention. Markey picks up major support for Senate bid, including from Kerry . If that's not enough, we already have three special elections in 2013 to fill vacant House seats. 5. The race for 2016: Call this the pre pre-season. While it may seem absurd to many people that we are already talking about the next presidential contest when the 2012 election is barely in our rear view mirror, this is the world we live in. So get used to it. Hillary Clinton hasn't even stepped down yet as secretary of state and there's already constant speculation as to whether she'll run again for the White House. While no decision from her on any future bid for president is expected in 2013, expect speculation about her future political plans to intensify throughout the new year. Opinion: For 2016, Bush vs. Clinton . Same thing, on a lower level, for Vice President Joe Biden. On the Republican side, we're already starting to look at Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and Christie, through the 2016 prism. In reality, with the real start of the 2016 campaign still about two years away, now's the time for these possible candidates to make speeches, meet and greet donors, campaign for fellow Republicans in the 2013 and 2014 elections, and write books. And we'll be here to cover it all.","Gun control: Will the reaction to Newtown lead to action?

"(CNN) -- Many people consider Trayvon Martin to be a 21st century Emmett Till. George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin as the 17-year-old African-American returned home after buying Skittles and iced tea. The killing has generated sadness, anger and frustration both because the innocent and inoffensive victim may have been targeted only because of his race, and because the admitted shooter was not arrested. After weeks of suspense, Florida special prosecutor Angela Corey has ordered Zimmerman arrested and charged him with second-degree murder. This development shows several positive things about the criminal justice system. First, it makes clear that even under Florida's liberal self-defense laws, an implausible or unsubstantiated claim of self-defense does not constitute a ""get out of jail free"" card. Florida's ""stand your ground"" law protects, some say over-protects, the right of self-defense. But judges and juries still have the power to evaluate the truth of self-defense claims, and defendants will be convicted of homicide if the prosecution can prove that killings were outside the law. In addition, at a press conference announcing the charge, Corey emphasized that the charges were based on careful investigation and evaluation of the facts, not on ""pressure or petition."" It is wonderful that the rallies, marches and protests brought attention to a case that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. But it would be disastrous for society if popular pressure alone could induce prosecutors to charge people with crimes. Some aspects of how the case will proceed are clear. First, while the prosecution was unconvinced by Zimmerman's self-defense claim, he is still entitled to present it to the jury at trial. If they accept it, of course, he will be acquitted. In addition, although Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder, even if the jury rejects the self-defense claim and believes the killing was homicide, they may choose to convict of a ""lesser included offense"" such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is still a serious felony, although it carries a lower penalty than murder. It is also important to note the stringency of the requirements for a second-degree murder charge. The prosecution must prove that a defendant had ""a depraved mind"" and acted ""without regard for human life."" The killing must be motivated by ""ill will, hatred, spite, or an evil intent."" The defense is likely to argue that even if Zimmerman made a misjudgment or mistake, as a neighborhood watch volunteer, he had none of these bad motives. He could claim that no one bent on murder would, as he did, call the police in advance. The lesser charge of manslaughter requires a killing through ""act, procurement or culpable negligence"" which can be established with less evidence of bad motive. There is another possibility. Under a particular set of facts it could be that both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman reasonably believed they were being confronted by unlawful violence from the other, and therefore that both thought they had to use force to defend themselves. If the jury found that to be the case, under Florida law, Zimmerman would be acquitted. It is impossible to say which of these scenarios is most likely. The prosecutor would not and could not have filed charges if she believed that Martin simply attacked Zimmerman, who fired because he reasonably feared for his own life. Beyond that, however, the prosecutor deliberately (and properly, under applicable ethical rules) declined to reveal what facts the investigation uncovered, or why she regarded them as showing that what happened was criminal. One possibility, admittedly speculative, is that the prosecutor concluded that Zimmerman illegally confronted the victim with a weapon without just cause, and that that criminal act led to the shooting. Because the critical facts of the case have not been revealed, it is impossible to predict how the case will fare when tested in the crucible of the courtroom. The evidence could be air-tight, but in cases from the Michael Jackson child molestation prosecution to the Dominique Strauss-Kahn rape prosecution, evidence that convinced prosecutors disintegrated in the face of vigorous defense advocacy. And Zimmerman will almost certainly get a high quality defense, paid for either by himself and his supporters or by the state of Florida, which will want to ensure the appearance of fairness on a case in the spotlight. Whatever else comes out of this incident, it is clear that it is risky for people to inject themselves into ambiguous situations they are neither properly trained nor legally authorized to handle. Even police departments often train off-duty officers to call 911 rather than taking direct action, unless human life is at risk. If there was ever any doubt, this case demonstrates that that is the right approach for private citizens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gabriel J. Chin.","Gabriel Chin: Charges show that ""stand your ground"" doesn't mean ""get out of jail free""
He says George Zimmerman is entitled to present his self-defense argument to the jury .
Chin: Proving second-degree murder charge is a high bar, but jury could convict on lesser charge .
He says one lesson is that private citizens should not direct action in case like this ."
"(CNN) -- Four shootings in less than an hour left three people dead in Omaha, Nebraska, police said. Two shooting victims were killed, as was one gunman, who was not identified, police said. Two other people were critically wounded. The shootings all took place in south Omaha on Saturday, the same day the city kicked off the College World Series -- the NCAA championship for baseball. Officers responded at 2:03 p.m. to the first shooting, which left 31-year-old Aaron Anderson in critical condition, police said. At 2:23 p.m., police responded to another shooting across town, which critically injured 46-year-old Angel Cabrera. Four minutes later, officers arrived at the scene of a third shooting. Pascual Bautista-Raymundo, 25, was hospitalized but later died, police said. Around 2:30 p.m., there was a fourth shooting, in which 25-year-old Anthony Vazzano died. A neighbor followed the suspect and gave police his location. When officers caught up with the suspect, a gunbattle ensued. Police fatally shot the suspect; no officers were injured. Omaha police said at a Sunday news conference that it appeared Anderson was targeted and the other shootings were random, CNN affiliate KETV reported.

"(CNN) -- She was named Sara, after the daughter of the man who found her, and she got to go home Wednesday. For her, home is the waters of the Florida Keys, a place no one expected she'd ever return to. Sara is a 115-pound federally protected loggerhead sea turtle who, if not for sheer luck, would be dead today. In early August, a father and son fishing in the Keys spotted Sara floating with a 4-foot spear sticking out of her head. The loggerhead was taken to the Florida Keys Turtle Hospital. ""This has to be one of the luckiest turtles in history,"" said veterinarian Doug Mader. The odds of saving Sara were not good. The spear had gone in just behind her ear and lodged against the jawbone on the other side. ""Quarter of an inch in either direction,"" said Mader, ""and the animal would be dead."" The shooting of the turtle had to be deliberate, said Rich Moretti, who runs the Turtle Hospital in Marathon. From the angle of entry it appeared to the medical team that Sara had been shot from above, probably from a boat. ""Everyone in the Keys was absolutely offended that someone would come down and do that to one of our turtles,"" Moretti said. He said he does not believe whoever shot the turtle was from the Keys. The spear was much bigger than what locals would normally use, he noted. The day after the turtle was rescued, Moretti took a picture of the spear to every dive shop in the area. He hoped the person who shot the turtle would come looking for a replacement and someone in that shop could make an identification. No luck. Doctors who first looked at the injured turtle said that with each breath she took, they could hear a fluttering sound. After stabilizing Sara and giving her antibiotics, Mader was able to remove the spear from her head and the flutter ended. Sara is a young turtle, about 12 years old. It was only a week ago she started eating on her own, gobbling up some squid. Once that happened, Moretti said, ""we knew it was time for her to go back home."" A $16,000 reward is offered for tips that lead to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the injury. Much of the money came from local commercial fishermen and boat captains. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Fisheries Service is investigating. The staff at the Turtle Hospital sees many accidental injuries, ""animals tied up in fishing line or hit by a boat,"" Moretti said. ""When we see something like this, intentional, it's rare."" It's even rarer for a turtle to survive and recover so quickly from the kind of damage Sara suffered. Under a beautiful blue September morning sky, Sara was released near the Seven Mile Bridge in Marathon. For the volunteers, the doctors, and Moretti, this was the kind of day that makes them smile.","Sara, a loggerhead sea turtle, was found with a spear in her head .

"Swat Valley, Pakistan (CNN) -- After the Pakistani Taliban shot her along with Malala Yousufzai, Kainat Ahmad couldn't sleep for two days. By now, millions around the world know how 14-year-old Malala and her classmates were attacked in their school van in the Swat Valley, a bastion of traditional Muslim practices in Pakistan. Malala: A global symbol, but still just a kid . Her attackers have vowed to kill Malala for demanding education for girls. Now she's fighting for her life at an English hospital, listed in stable condition Wednesday and unable to speak. But lesser-known Kainat can, and she shared her story in an exclusive interview. Speaking from her hospital room in Mingora, the 16-year-old described her startled reaction and lingering fears over the attack. Kainat, who was shot in the upper right arm, displayed a thoughtful demeanor as she chatted with CNN journalists . She vocalized what her friend Malala long preached: Girls, go to school and study, an idea violently opposed by the Taliban. Read more: Standing with Malala . ""I want to tell all the girls to continue their mission to get an education,"" Kainat said Tuesday. ""Girls' education here is more important than boys' because boys can do any sort of work. However, girls can't just do any sort of job. Girls must have respectful jobs so that they can feel secure."" The 10th-grader toughed out the ordeal. She said she has no regrets about defying a group that wants to stop girls from learning. ""God willing, I will continue my education,"" she said. The attack occurred on October 9. Attention has focused on Malala because the Taliban targeted her over activism. The shooting prompted an unusually strong and united reaction of disgust and anger in Pakistan and other countries. Rallies supporting Malala have spread nationwide. Anger has been directed toward the Pakistani Taliban, the extremist group that has claimed responsibility for the shooting and said it will seek to kill Malala if she recovers from her injuries.

The group, which operates in northwestern Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan, has fallen out of favor for such attacks. A 2009 video that emerged of the flogging of a teenage girl in the Swat Valley enraged Pakistanis. Kainat appreciated attention from hospital visitors -- from reporters to government officials -- and was gratified to emphasize the need for girls' education. ""I can't believe what's happened, but I am happy everyone is here to see me,"" she said. She can remember just a snippet of the attack. She said she was talking to her friend about an Urdu-language exam when a male approached. ""He asked, 'Who is Malala?' When someone told him, he started firing. Sir, because of this, Malala suddenly fell,"" she said. Kainat, who fainted during the attack, couldn't describe the shooter. Read more: Millions of children face Malala's fight for education . ""I didn't see anything,"" she said. ""I just heard the gunshots. I don't know what happened. I just passed out."" She woke up in an emergency room. It has since dawned on her that the incident has gone viral, with people across the world viewing defiant female Pakistani students like her and Malala as heroic. So far, the terror hasn't worn off as she recovers from her wound. ""I want to tell you that when I think about what happened, it's still in my head and sometimes it's terrifying,"" she said. The attackers shot a third girl, who also survived. Kainat's remarks focus on Malala and her classmates. She hopes other girls ""stay ambitious in their studies."" A spokesman for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham said Wednesday that Malala ""continued to impress doctors by responding well to her care."" Kainat wants Malala to recover. ""She was good friends with everyone,"" Kainat said. ""I hope Malala gets better as soon as possible and comes back to her country and joins us at school again.""

"(CNN) -- An Ohio man accused of murder, rape and holding three women in a Cleveland house against their will pleaded not guilty Wednesday. His attorney said it was an effort to stave off a death penalty and an arduous trial. Ariel Castro, 52, wore an orange jumpsuit, kept his head bowed and didn't speak as attorneys entered the plea on their client's behalf at his brief arraignment in a Cleveland courtroom. He was indicted last week on 329 counts. Defense attorney Craig Weintraub, speaking to reporters after the arraignment, said some charges in the indictment ""cannot be disputed."" But the plea -- targeting the murder accusations and the specter of a death penalty -- signals an effort to forge a ""resolution"" and avoid a trial, he said. Two counts accuse Castro of aggravated murder for purposely causing the unlawful termination of pregnancies. Police say one of the young women he is accused of holding was impregnated five times by Castro, and another bore a child fathered by him. Weintraub told reporters that the plea ""requires the prosecutor to continue to evaluate their case and determine whether medical and forensic evidence can actually support an aggravated murder conviction for the death of a fetus and whether the death penalty is warranted."" Rescued women 'happy and safe,' attorneys say . The prosecutor released a statement saying a capital review committee will consider whether the case is appropriate for seeking the death penalty once the indictment process is complete. Weintraub, Castro's attorney, acknowledged that ""in all likelihood, the prosecutor's decision will be predicated upon the opinions of medical and forensic experts, and more importantly, whether the women in this case want this case to go to trial for those limited issues."" ""We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community,"" the lawyer said. ""Mr. Castro currently faces hundreds of years in prison with the current charges, and it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty."" Life during and after the abductions . Ian Friedman, a Cleveland criminal defense attorney, told CNN's Piers Morgan later Wednesday that Castro's defense team appeared to be laying out a scenario that ends with their client spending the rest of his life behind bars. ""Don't bring the death penalty, there will be a plea, let's do life,"" Friedman said, offering his take on their strategy. The charges cover only half of the 10 years the three women allegedly were held captive -- from August 2002, when the first of the three disappeared off a Cleveland street, to February 2007. In addition to the two murder counts, the indictment charges Castro with 139 counts of rape, 177 counts of kidnapping, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, three counts of felonious assault and one count of possession of criminal tools, prosecutors said. Castro's case has attracted national attention because of the unusual length and depravity of the alleged crimes. ""The horrific brutality and torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension,"" Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty has said. 'Please don't let me go,' Cleveland kidnap victim told officers . The women were freed last month after one of the three shouted for help while Castro was away from his 1,400-square-foot home. The women have been identified as Michelle Knight, abducted at age 21 in August 2002; Amanda Berry, who was kidnapped at age 16 in April 2003 and has a 6-year-old daughter allegedly fathered by Castro; and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, who was 14 when she disappeared in 2004. Lawyers for the women expressed confidence and satisfaction after the indictment came down last week. Jim Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, and speaking on behalf of Knight, said Wednesday that ""days like today are not easy."" ""We understand the legal process needs to run its course,"" he said. ""We are hopeful for a just and prompt resolution. We have great faith in the prosecutor's office and the court."" DeJesus knew Ariel Castro, her family told CNN affiliate WOIO. She was a good friend of Castro's daughter, Arlene. One year after DeJesus' disappearance, Arlene Castro publicly crusaded to find her friend's kidnapper. In spring 2005 she went on the national television program ""America's Most Wanted"" to plead for help in finding her friend. Ariel Castro gave ex-daughter-in-law the 'heebie-jeebies' Ariel Castro attended at least two public vigils for the missing girls while they were allegedly inside his home, relatives told WOIO. Castro, a former school bus driver, remains in a Cleveland jail on $8 million bond. He made a brief court appearance soon after his arrest. Handcuffed and wearing a blue jumpsuit, he looked down throughout that hearing and did not speak. Castro's brothers: Ariel fooled us .

"(CNN) -- The deadly clashes that are a fact of daily life in Syria have now bled into Lebanon, where a series of sectarian shootouts this week are raising fears that a period of relative calm for the country may be nearing an end. Syria has dominated Lebanon's political scene for much of its post-independence history -- and while many Lebanese support the embattled regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, many others do not. It's too early to tell whether this week's clashes are blips on the radar or the new norm -- but many observers believe the longer Syria's conflict goes on, the more destabilizing it will be for Lebanon. What's the latest in Lebanon? A series of clashes in the past week between political and religious groups who either support or oppose the Syrian regime has shaken Lebanon and prompted fears that renewed factional rivalries could erupt into outright warfare. The kidnapping Tuesday of a group of Shiite Muslim pilgrims in Syria prompted angry protests in the Lebanese capital of Beirut one day after gun battles between rival political parties -- one supporting Syria's al-Assad and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded. It was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where it was once commonplace since the powerful Hezbollah militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008. The bloodshed followed the Lebanese military's killing of two Sunni Muslim clerics -- both of whom were opposed to the Syrian regime -- at a checkpoint in northern Lebanon hours earlier. The military later apologized for the shootings, saying the car carrying the clerics failed to heed the army's warning to stop. And last week the arrest of an activist in Tripoli -- a northern Lebanese city known for its opposition to al-Assad -- for providing food and shelter to Syrian refugees sparked clashes between Alawite and Sunni Muslim sects that killed up to seven people and left dozens wounded. What is the history between Syria and Lebanon? Aside from its southern border with Israel, Lebanon is entirely surrounded by Syria, and was considered part of ""greater Syria"" until the end of World War I. It became an independent country in 1943 but has been strongly influenced by Syria both politically and militarily for much of the time since. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peace-keeprs to help stop Lebanon's long civil war -- but maintained a significant presence long after the fighting stopped in 1990. This all changed in 2005 after former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed by a car bomb in Beirut. Anti-Assad elements in Lebanon accused the Syrian regime of being behind the attack, and popular protests -- along with international pressure -- forced the Syrian military to withdraw from the country. Since then, Lebanon's two most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided in their attitude toward Syria -- the ruling pro-Syria alliance led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati and a group of anti-Syrian factions led by Saad Hariri, son of the assassinated former prime minister. How else has the Syrian conflict affected Lebanon? Thousands of refugees have poured into Lebanon since the conflict in Syria began in March 2011, mostly in the north. And there is evidence rebel groups are receiving small arms smuggled across both the Lebanese and Turkish borders. In April the Lebanese army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for Tripoli -- the northern epicenter of support for Syrian rebels in Lebanon -- that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in Syria. Does the Lebanese government support the Syrian uprising? Prime Minister Mikati's alliance is a firm, if quiet, supporter of the Assad regime, but the government is more interested in keeping Lebanon from getting dragged into the conflict, says Middle East expert Chris Phillips of Queen Mary, University of London. ""They're aware they're a weak government, and they're not keen on Lebanon becoming a staging point for the rebels to launch attacks on Syria,"" Phillips told CNN. ""But there hasn't been a major drive to push the Free Syrian Army out of the country because the government knows a large segment of the Lebanese population supports the rebels."" What part do religious tensions play in Lebanon? Lebanon has always struggled to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects, and the current tensions mirror those in Syria -- in both countries, the Shiite and Alawite Muslim sects (Assad is an Alawite) tend to support the Syrian regime, while support is growing among Sunni Muslims for Syrian rebels. The country also has a large Christian population, and both Sunni and Shiite groups have lobbied for Christian support during past conflicts. Sunnis are in the majority in northern Lebanon, where they have clashed with a small but strong enclave of pro-Assad Alawites in recent weeks. The core of the Syrian president's support in Lebanon is in the southern part of the country. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom says the big worry is that Syria's troubles will reopen the wounds of Lebanon's long civil war, with the Sunni community pitted against Hezbollah, the powerful pro-Assad Shiite militia. What is Hezbollah and why hasn't it gotten involved yet? Hezbollah is a powerful Shiite militant group in Lebanon and a staunch ally of the Assad regime in Syria. The group, financed and armed by Iran and Syria, is classified by the United States and Israel, among others, a terrorist organization, and is believed to be responsible for a number of attacks on Western targets including the suicide bombings that killed 241 Americans at the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. Hezbollah has evolved into a social and political movement in recent years, but it remains the most formidable armed militia in Lebanon. Read more: The inner workings of Hezbollah . While the militia's leader Hassan Nasrallah praised the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, Hezbollah needs the Assad regime to ensure that the group's supply line to Iran, its main benefactor, remains open. While Hezbollah is more than capable of taking the fight to Syrian rebels based in Lebanon, Phillips says the militia doesn't believe the Assad regime is in trouble -- yet. ""Hezbollah cares very much about public opinion, and if they went in guns blazing that would divide the Lebanese population -- and they've already lost some support because of their backing of Assad,"" Phillips told CNN. Is Syria deliberately stirring up violence in Lebanon? Many in Lebanon believe the recent violence was intentionally stirred up by Syria to distract from the country's own unrest and to prove Assad's claim that a destabilized Syria will lead to chaos in neighboring countries, but there's no real proof of Syrian involvement, according to Phillips. ""Is this merely an internal conflict within Lebanon, or is it Syria's way of putting pressure on the international community? It's unclear at the moment which of these is the reason for the current violence,"" says Phillips. Depending on the vantage point, Bashar al-Assad's recent assertion that those who ""sow chaos in Syria"" may be infected by it themselves sounds either like an astute observation or a direct threat to the regime's enemies in Lebanon. How bad will things get in Lebanon? The recent bloodshed in Lebanon has threatened the country's fragile political and religious balance, but observers believe a full-scale breakdown is unlikely for several reasons. First, the Assad regime remains in firm control of the vast majority of Syria, and northern Lebanon's support for the rebels hasn't reached the point where it would warrant a Syrian or Hezbollah response. Phillips says another promising factor is that all sides in Lebanon -- most importantly Hezbollah -- appear to be advocating peace following the deadly clashes in Tripoli and Beirut. ""Hezbollah has a huge military capability and if there was ever a civil war, it's well known that the group would be the most well-equipped to triumph,"" Phillips said. ""But they're very conscious of being seen as a destabilizing force in Lebanon."" Phillips believes the war exhaustion factor is also very high in Lebanon. Beirut is still recovering from Israel's shelling of the city in 2006 during a 34-day conflict sparked by Hezbollah's kidnapping of Israeli troops near the Lebanese border, and many other wounds from the 1975-1990 civil war have yet to heal. ""There's been an assumption for several years that the Lebanese people are fed up and exhausted with civil war,"" said Phillips. ""The civil war there ended not because of any resolution, but simply because people lost the will to keep fighting."" While all parties appear determined to avoid a return to the dark days of the past, Lebanon's future could rely as much on the outcome of the Syrian conflict as on political goodwill within its own borders. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom, Rima Maktabi and CNN Wires contributed to this report.","Syria's conflict has spilled into Lebanon, where clashes killed 9 in Tripoli and Beirut .

"(EW.com) -- Several top-level producers of ""The Simpsons"" have agreed to take pay cuts to keep the long-running animated show on the air, sources confirm. Some -- though not all -- of the producers of the Fox series have indicated they're willing to have their pay reduced to continue the series beyond its current record-setting 23rd season. The cast, however, have yet to agree to terms with the studio. As Variety reported, ""Simpsons"" studio 20th Century Fox TV has demanded a 45 percent pay cut and the voice actors countered with a 30% reduction, plus a piece of the back end. The studio rejected that proposal. Fox has previously declared the iconic hit is no longer sustainable under its current deal and is demanding salary reductions in order for the series to continue. All sides, however, strongly believe a deal will be reached. Even with reduced paychecks, there's still plenty of money on the table. Nobody wants to see ""The Simpsons"" end its legacy without a proper series finale. And a final season would likely create considerable buzz and renewed interest in the show, which is used to launch the rest of Fox's Sunday night animated block. See the full article at EW.com .

"(CNN) -- Doctors treating Andrea Yates, who drowned her five children in a bathtub in 2001, will ask that she be allowed to leave her mental hospital for two hours each week to attend church, her attorney said Thursday. ""It is a recommendation of the doctors that she be permitted to attend, and of course she wants to,"" attorney George Parnham said. ""It would be both beneficial and mentally therapeutic for her. She has been accepted into a congregation. It is simply a baby step in the right direction toward acclimation into a community down the road of sorts."" Yates' doctors at Kerrville State Hospital, in Kerrville, Texas, will make the request of the trial judge ""in the next week or two,"" Parnham said. ""I am all for it, but of course it is the judge's decision and we all recognize it,"" he said. Now 47, Yates ""has not been seen or been a part of any portion of society for the last 11 years,"" Parnham said Thursday. During her first trial in 2002, jurors heard taped interviews in which Yates said that she thought Satan was sending her messages and that she was sending her children -- Noah, 7; John, 5; Paul, 3; Luke, 2; and Mary, 6 months -- to heaven and sparing them from hell when she killed them on June 20, 2001. Several medical experts testified that she suffered from schizophrenia, depression and other medical conditions. Parnham argued Yates was suffering from a ""full-blown psychosis."" ""If this woman doesn't meet the test of insanity in this state, then nobody does,"" Parnham told the jury. ""We might as well wipe it from the books."" But jurors rejected her insanity defense and sentenced her to life in prison for the deaths of three of the children. A state appeals court overturned the conviction because an expert witness for the state, a psychiatrist, testified erroneously that the television series ""Law and Order"" had aired an episode about a woman suffering from post-partum depression who drowned her children. In 2006, a second jury found Yates not guilty by reason of insanity, meaning she was committed to a state mental facility. Her former husband, Russell Yates, said at the time he was pleased with that verdict. ""Yes, Andrea took the lives of our children,"" he said. ""That's the truth. But also, yes, she was insane. Yes, she was psychotic on that day. That's the whole truth."" Yates had been on anti-psychotic medication and attempted suicide before the killings. ""We took her to a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist failed us,"" Russell Yates has said. He has since remarried. ""Mental illness is the culprit"" in the deaths, Parnham told CNN affiliate KPRC this week. ""There were six victims that day, and Andrea is one of them.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Four decades since Roe v. Wade, and little, it seems, has changed. The January 22, 1973, Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion remains the law of the land, passions remain high on both sides of the issue, and protests are held each year on its anniversary. Access to abortion, then and now, is about more than simple legalities. Social, religious and family values, as well as finances and politics, still play a role in shaping the abortion issue, but many legal and medical experts say the debate has become entrenched. ""Much of the controversy about abortion is really stimulated by the interest groups on both sides of the political question, rather than by ordinary Americans,"" said David Garrow, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and a longtime Supreme Court scholar. ""The American people and many political leaders have already made up their minds about legal abortion."" Public opinion on abortion has remained stable over the years. A CNN/Opinion Research survey last August found 44% said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, while 52% said only under few or no circumstances. And 88% said the procedure should be allowed when the woman's life is in danger; 83-percent said so in cases of rape or incest. The margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 points. The Roe decision did not prompt ""abortion on demand,"" as many opponents of the procedure had predicted it would. Nor have various legislatures or court rulings restricted access as much as some supporters claim. Research from the Alan Guttmacher Institute finds the number of abortions at its lowest level since Roe, remaining steady at about 1.2 million reported procedures in the year 2011, down 25-percent since the all-time high in 1990. Bans on abortion in the United States began early in the 19th century. Connecticut in 1812 became first state to outlaw them, specifically after ""quickening,"" the time in the pregnancy when the woman starts to feel fetal movements. The laws were designed primarily to protect women from dangerous ""back alley"" abortions. These laws were also ambiguous, given the Victorian moral code that stifled debate on so personal a subject as unwanted pregnancies. Since then, movements have come and gone to relax the restrictions or to give women more choice, but such efforts mostly went nowhere. It was not until the 1960s that an organized movement was launched to ease the laws regulating abortions. Medical technology had advanced to the point where they could be done safely by trained medical staff in clean, professional environments. By the early 1970s, a number of states had changed their laws, though most did so in very limited ways. Survey: Few religious groups want decision overturned despite abortion views . The legal fights culminated with Roe v. Wade, the court's 7-2 decision giving women a qualified constitutional right to abortion during most of the pregnancy. The court, in fact, heard two cases around the same time: Roe (aka Norma McCorvey, who has since become an abortion opponent), which challenged a Texas law banning abortions except to save the woman's life; and Doe v. Bolton, involving a Georgia law requiring that abortions be performed only in accredited hospitals and only after a review by a hospital staff committee and an exam by two doctors other than the woman's physician. The Roe and Doe rulings affected laws in 46 states. For the justices, Roe reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy. That ""right,"" wrote Justice Harry Blackmun in the main opinion for the court, is ""broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."" ""Prior to Roe,"" said Garrow, ""whether one could obtain a legal abortion in the face of an unwanted pregnancy was a crapshoot. For 40 years now, it's been a constitutionally guaranteed right."" He is the 1994 author of ""Liberty and Sexuality: The Right to Privacy and the Making of Roe v. Wade."" But the ruling was a qualified one, and that fact has been used by abortion opponents in their efforts to narrow the scope of other abortion provisions. Blackmun noted that the state's ""important interests in safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, and protecting potential life"" are compelling enough to justify regulation ""at some point in pregnancy."" That ""qualified right"" found its form in the controversial ""trimester analysis"" laid out by the justices in Roe: permitting no government regulation during the first three months of a pregnancy; allowing limited regulation in the second trimester to protect the woman's health and safety; and granting government the power to ban abortions during the third trimester -- a time when, medical consensus has concluded, the fetus is capable of living on its own. That reasoning has outraged abortion opponents and puzzled many legal scholars. ""The better argument for the result reached in Roe v. Wade,"" said Edward Lazarus -- a former law clerk for Blackmun and an author of ""Closed Chambers: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court""-- ""is that it's necessary for the equality of women, rather than grounding it in the privacy right."" After Roe, the high court affirmed the right to abortion in subsequent cases: striking down provisions requiring a husband's consent for a first-trimester abortion; requiring parental consent for an unmarried woman under 18; striking down efforts to expand on laws requiring women to give informed consent before having an abortion; striking down a 24-hour waiting period; and striking down a law requiring doctors to inform women of the risks and of assistance available if she were to carry the fetus to term. But there was one notable victory for abortion opponents: a ban on the use of taxpayer funds to finance abortions for poor women. The abortion issue has been revisited several times since Roe, most famously in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). Opinion: If Ireland had Roe v. Wade . Webster (a 5-4 decision) upheld major parts of a Missouri abortion law that prohibited the use of public facilities or the participation of public employees in abortions, and required doctors to test the viability of the fetus before an performing any abortion. Justices William Rehnquist, Byron White and Anthony Kennedy said they would allow restrictions on abortion, but only if the restrictions had a rational basis. More important, the three conservative justices said, a compelling government interest need not be required to justify restrictions on abortion. That was a blow for anti-abortion forces. Then came the Casey ruling, in which the justices outlined their views on Roe. The decision (also 5-4) reaffirmed the heart of Roe while giving states the power to regulate procedures so long as they did not impose an ""undue burden"" on a woman's right to abortion. The standard: Undue burden exists if ""the purpose and effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability."" The ruling left supporters on both sides of the issue dissatisfied, feeling it was ambiguous. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined neither opinion, saying there was nothing in it to justify reconsidering Roe. Nevertheless, Blackmun wrote, ""the right to reproductive choice"" was in danger of being overturned. Another legacy of Roe: The head-counting of justices on the court, a what-if scenario that could lead to the overturning of Roe. The current 5-4 conservative majority might shift in either direction if two or more justices leave the bench in the next few years, as is widely expected. In the meantime, conservatives in Congress have promised to push for tougher restrictions on access to abortion, though many political experts say the goal is not necessarily aimed at overturning Roe. They found success five years ago when the justices, in a 5-4 ruling, upheld a federal ban on a controversial late-term procedure, rejecting concerns the law didn't take into account the physical safety of the woman. The procedure -- called ""partial birth abortion"" by its critics -- is typically performed in the middle-to-late second trimester. The legal sticking point was that the law lacked a ""health exception"" for women who might suffer serious medical complications, something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions. The swing vote, as in previous cases, came from Kennedy. In angry dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, then the lone woman on the high court, called the majority's conclusions ""alarming"" and said they ""cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court, and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives."" Ginsburg has long been a leading voice for gender equality. Ironically, some of the opposition to her 1993 nomination to the high court came from feminists, who did not like her criticism over the legal reasoning of Roe. She believed a more gradual liberalization to abortion would have kept the issue back in the states, avoiding the social and political upheaval that has been part of Roe's legacy. The law on abortion was evolving at the time of Roe, Ginsburg recalled in 2005. ""The Supreme Court stopped all that by deeming every law -- even the most liberal -- as unconstitutional. That seemed to me not the way courts generally work."" But Ginsburg, in her rulings, has upheld a woman's reproductive choice. ""When government controls that decision for her, she's being treated as less than a full adult human being responsible for her own choices,"" she said during her confirmation. If there is one overriding legacy of the Roe decision, it may be that it opened and expanded the debate on the rights of women, sexuality, health care, and medical decisions. Issues like cloning, stem cells, and fetal research have become part of the national lexicon. As significant as it was, Roe v. Wade was only the beginning of the battle.","40 years later, Roe remains the law of the land .
Passions still run high on both sides of the landmark decision .

"(CNN) -- Unable to rescue a man devoured by a giant sinkhole, workers started demolishing his Florida home Sunday -- three days after the ground under his bedroom opened up and swallowed him. Crowds watched as a backhoe plunged its bucket into the home's blue walls, leaving the wreckage of wood beams and cinder blocks where rooms once stood. Some snapped photos with cell phone cameras, said John Gauntt, a reporter for CNN affiliate Bay News 9. Others turned toward the ground with tears in their eyes. Demolition of the house lasted for about three hours on Sunday and was expected to continue on Monday morning, Hillsborough County Administrator Mike Merrill told reporters. It was a delicate process, officials said, as a county employee skillfully maneuvered a massive piece of construction equipment to scoop up the family's valuables and carry them to safety. The items salvaged included a Bible, military awards and an American flag that hung near the house's front door. One woman wept as an official handed her a framed family portrait. The demolition crew worked for only a few hours on Sunday to give the family time to sift through their belongings, Merrill said. But authorities said they couldn't recover Jeff Bush's body from the massive hole that opened up under his bedroom. The sinkhole -- about 20 feet wide and 50 to 60 feet deep -- was still expanding, they said, and the suburban Tampa house could collapse at any time. Authorities made the heartbreaking decision to stop the search for Bush after the odds against his survival became abundantly clear. ""We just have not been able to locate Mr. Bush, and so for that reason, the rescue effort is being discontinued,"" Merrill told reporters Saturday evening. ""At this point, it's really not possible to recover the body."" The Bush family's nightmare began Thursday night, just as everyone was about to go to sleep. A deafening noise shattered the peace in the blue, one-story home in the suburb of Seffner. Then, Jeremy Bush said he heard his brother, Jeff, scream. ""I ran toward my brother's bedroom,"" he told CNN's ""AC360."" ""Everything was gone. My brother's bed, my brother's dresser, my brother's TV. My brother was gone."" Jeremy Bush jumped in the hole and frantically shoveled away rubble. But as the house's floor collapsed, a sheriff's deputy pulled him to safety, while his brother remained trapped below. ""I couldn't get him out,"" Jeremy Bush said, weeping. ""I tried so hard. I tried everything I could."" Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . Jeremy Bush and four others, including a 2-year-old child, were uninjured. After officials called off the search for his brother's body Saturday, Jeremy Bush told Bay News 9 the family was devastated. ""It's not just I lost my brother. There are so many memories in this house,"" he told the CNN affiliate. ""My wife and her brother and the whole family. ... Every holiday, we gathered at this house. Her grandmother passed away. All the stuff to remember her by is in this house, and we're losing it all. You can't replace that. You can't replace a life being gone."" As crews began demolishing the house Sunday, pieces of the family's lives were pushed into public view. Walls with picture frames on them came crashing down. Baby toys and clothes on hangers were raked across the ground. Knocking down the unsafe structure is necessary, officials said, to get a better look at the sinkhole and to figure out the best way to fill it. ""Once they can get a better view, then they can get a sense of what the next step is. ... This is one step at a time, because we really don't know what we're dealing with here,"" Merrill said Sunday morning. Sinkholes are common in the state, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Florida lies on bedrock made of limestone or other carbonate rock that can be eaten away by acidic groundwater, forming voids that collapse when the rock can no longer support the weight of what's above it. Hillsborough County, on Florida's west coast, is part of an area known as ""sinkhole alley"" that accounts for two thirds of the sinkhole-related insurance claims in the state, according to a Florida state Senate Insurance and Banking Committee report. With officials concerned that more ground near the house in Seffner could give way Sunday, the massive backhoe demolishing the house kept its distance, staying on the street. Nearby homes were evacuated Friday as a precaution. The family that lived next door was given about 30 minutes to grab belongings before abandoning the house, which was compromised by the sinkhole, fire department spokesman Ronnie Rivera said. Though the risky search for Jeff Bush has ended, the danger has not. Merrill said workers were dealing with a ""very unusual sinkhole"" -- deep, wide and extremely unstable. ""It's underground, it's unseen and we're uncertain as to what's under there,"" said John Lyons, the county's director of public works. ""So we'll be very cautious going in."" Contractors will finish demolition work on Monday, he said. ""They'll pull out the rest of the structure, load it up and take it away."" But authorities said Jeff Bush's body will remain in its final resting place, trapped underground where the house his family lived in for generations once stood.

"(CNN) -- The Pakistani teen blogger simply sought to get an education. But she became a symbol of defiance against militants, empowering young women worldwide. The story of Malala Yousufzai, 15, an outspoken critic of the Taliban, is full of contradictions. Tragic, yet triumphant. Unafraid, yet battling one of the world's most feared terror groups. An old soul, yet just a kid. For years, the young activist has been at odds with the Taliban over her education crusade. She has openly defied the group's teachings on educating girls and encouraged her peers to do the same. In an attempt to silence her, militants stormed her school van in October, barked out her name and put a bullet in her head. But the attack only amplified her voice and rallied a world of supporters to her side. CNN.com readers voted her as the second-most intriguing person of 2012, days after she was short-listed for Time's Person of the Year. U.S. President Barack Obama came first in both lists. Most intriguing people of 2012 . Constant threats . Malala's global recognition has come with a price. While most girls her age relish their teen years, she is undergoing grueling treatment in Britain after the shooting. She lives under constant threats for going to school in the conservative Swat Valley region in northwest Pakistan, where women are repressed under the militants' strict interpretation of Islam. Despite the dangers, Malala blogged ferociously about her dream of learning without fear. She used television interviews, documentaries and took to the streets to challenge the iron hand on women. She accused the Taliban of thriving on ignorance. ""Where in the Quran does it say that girls should not be educated?"" she asked last year. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Her role as an activist led to the attack on the van carrying her and other girls home from school, two of whom were also hurt, but not as severely. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" a Taliban spokesman later said. Slow recovery . More than two months after the assassination attempt, Malala is still undergoing treatment. She went from an intensive care unit in Pakistan to a hospital in the British city of Birmingham. Before she left home, she was unconscious. She now walks, writes and reads. After she regains her strength, she will undergo more surgeries. It is astounding that she suffered no major brain or nerve damage from the shooting, her doctors say. Photos: Malala and the women of Pakistan . Her story of defiance has sparked marches worldwide demanding girls' education. It has inspired girls in far-flung areas, who relate to her because she is a child herself. World leaders have hailed the ""Malala effect"" that made young girls even more determined to get an education. On November 10, the United Nations marked Malala Day to honor her advocacy work. And her fight for education is not over yet. In a message this month thanking supporters, she told them not to make this about her. ""People have actually supported a cause, not an individual,"" she said. ""Let's work together to educate girls around the world."" In her continued commitment to education, she called on Pakistani officials Friday to reverse a decision to name a school after her. She made the request over safety concerns for the students after the Taliban attacked the school. Before she intervened, students protested and tore down her pictures over the decision to name the school after her, saying the move put them at risk. 'A new heroine' Pakistani girls' education has long been hampered by widespread poverty and threats by hardline Islamist groups. The United Nations estimates 32 million girls worldwide don't have access to an education. Roughly 10% of those live in Pakistan. ""Pakistan has a new heroine and a new cause -- a girl's right to education,"" former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said last month. ""Malala's courage has awoken Pakistan's silent majority who are no longer prepared to tolerate the threats and intimidations of the Pakistan Taliban."" Since Malala was 11, she has used her blog to encourage girls to go to school despite Taliban threats. Her focus led her homeland to award her its first National Peace Prize last year. In January 2009, militants took over her once-tranquil city in Swat Valley and ordered schools to stop educating girls. She blogged about the Taliban's efforts to scare girls away from learning institutions. They raided homes to confiscate books, she said. Malala hid hers under her bed. ""I was scared of being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education,"" she said last year. Her fears almost came to fruition. After the shooting, militants vowed that if she survived, they would go after her again. They also threatened to kill journalists covering her story. ""This filthy, godless media has taken huge advantage of this situation, and journalists have started passing judgment on us,"" the Taliban said in a statement. Malala is uncowed. When she takes a break from treatment, a white teddy bear with a pink bow sits on her lap. In her hands, there is always an open book.","The education advocate is a global symbol of empowerment for young women .

"Swat Valley, Pakistan (CNN) -- On October 9, a Pakistani schoolgirl who dared to speak out against the Taliban took a bullet to the head for her act of defiance. Now, as Malala Yousufzai lies in a hospital bed in Birmingham, England, the shock and outrage among her countrymen have given way to a new sentiment: What will the government do about this? While the Pakistani news media debate how the country should respond to the attack, thousands of people nationwide have joined in rallies in support of the wounded 14-year-old. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . The shooting has prompted an unusually strong and united reaction of disgust and anger among many Pakistanis, analysts say. ""There is a groundswell of sympathy for her and also a very strong demand for the Pakistani state to do something about this issue,"" said Raza Rumi, director of policy and programs at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani research organization. Much of the discontent is directed toward the Pakistani Taliban, the extremist group that has claimed responsibility for the shooting and said it will seek to kill Malala if she recovers from her injuries. ""This has created a very bad feeling for the Taliban,"" said Saleem Khan, an executive with a paper manufacturing company in the city of Lahore. Khan said he was ""crying and weeping"" after hearing of the attack on Malala, who had defied extremists in the northwestern Swat Valley by insisting on the right of girls to go to school. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, the first woman to hold that job, said Sunday that she thinks the shooting marked a ""turning point"" in the ferocity of how Pakistan goes after Taliban offenders and extremist groups. ""Pakistan, at the diplomatic, political and every level, has been asking ... to take this matter seriously, to not let them (the Taliban) have a safe haven,"" she said. Meanwhile, police in Birmingham said ""two well-wishers"" were stopped when they came to the hospital overnight wanting to see the girl. No arrests were made, contrary to earlier reports from the hospital. Hospital director Dave Rosser said the intruders were ""probably people being over-curious,"" but he added that the hospital is taking no chances and that tight security is in place. Standing with Malala: Teen inspires others to fight for education . At a rally organized by the powerful MQM political party in Karachi, thousands of people gathered, some waving flags and banners with messages of support for Malala. ""Our prayers are with you,"" read one. Another said, ""Malala -- (an) attack on you is an attack on education and progress."" Social activist Saman Jafery said: ""If Taliban is a mindset, then Malala is a mindset, too. It's a mindset of educated and empowered women."" Another of those at the rally, Haider Rizvi, said people ""don't want the Taliban anymore in Pakistan, and after the Malala incident, it is time for people to stand up."" ""The message is right here ... all these people. They are condemning the act of the Taliban,"" added student Ashwar Waqi. The Taliban, who operate in northwestern Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan, have fallen foul of Pakistani public opinion in the past, notably in 2009, when a video emerged of the flogging of a teenage girl in the Swat Valley. The video provoked appalled reactions in Pakistan at the time, but ""the scale of protests for Malala are bigger,"" said the Jinnah Institute's Rumi. ""Even the right-wing mainstream media have expressed outrage."" The Taliban became increasingly unpopular among Pakistanis in 2009 as the military carried out an offensive against members of the group in northwestern areas. But the military operations failed to root them out altogether, and their continued influence in the region was demonstrated last week by the gun attack on Malala and two other girls as they were being driven home from school. The two other girls were less severely wounded than Malala. Opinion: One girl's courage in the face of Taliban cowardice . One of them, Kainat Ahmed, is being treated locally. She said she was so scared after the attack on the bus in which they traveled that she couldn't sleep for two days. The 16-year-old girl is in the 10th grade. But despite the injury to her arm and the terror of the attack, Ahmed said she does not regret studying and hopes to continue. ""Girls' education here is more important than boys' because boys can have any jobs they want to but girls cannot,"" she said. ""I want to tell all the girls to continue their mission to get an education."" Interior Minister Rehman Malik, visiting the three girls' school in the town of Mingora on Tuesday, said the name would be changed from ""Khushal Public School"" to ""Malala Public High School."" A task force will be established to protect all girls' schools in the region that are under threat of militants, he told reporters. ""I am not only grieved, the whole nation is grieved,"" he said. The hunt for those responsible has made ""considerable progress,"" Malik added, although he gave few details of the investigation. Authorities have forensic evidence, Malik said. Police Chief Gul Afzal Afridi of the Swat District said that 60 suspects are being detained, interrogated or investigated. ""We have sufficient evidence to find the culprits,"" the chief said. ""Soon we will catch them."" Politicians and commentators in Pakistan have slammed the attack. But the condemnation of the Taliban has not been as universal. ""Everybody was angry that it happened, but not everybody was angry with the Taliban,"" said Tazeen Javed, an Islamabad-based communications consultant who writes for The Express Tribune newspaper. The cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan, who visited Malala in a hospital in Peshawar last week, has drawn criticism for not condemning the Taliban outright for the attack. Khan ""showed a lot of concern but couldn't resist bringing in the issue of the drone strikes as a cause for this attack, which was a bit of a deflection,"" said Rumi, referring to the drone attacks carried out by the United States in northwestern Pakistan that have generated resentment in the country. Certain commentators have also begun to question the official version of events, suggesting that the attack on Malala may be used as a pretext by the government for military action against the Taliban in the restive tribal region of North Waziristan. Gordon Brown: Millions face Malala's fight . ""The Malala incident is the CIA's latest attempt to divide public opinion and incite conflict in Pakistani society,"" Haider Mehdi, a contributor to the Pakistani daily The Nation, wrote in a column Tuesday. As the controversy about the attack rages in Pakistan, the doctors treating Malala thousands of miles away said they are ""very pleased"" with her progress and optimistic that she will make a good recovery. However, she faces reconstructive surgery and there is ""still a long way to go,"" said Rosser, of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Her family is not yet in England to be by her bedside, but the Pakistani high commissioner is making arrangements on that front, he said. In the meantime, the 14-year-old appears to be ""every bit as strong as we had been led to believe,"" Rosser said, adding that the consultant leading her care ""is impressed by her resilience and her strength.""

"(CNN) -- Everyone -- and we mean everyone -- puts their proverbial best foot forward online. And why shouldn't they? They say that first impressions are everything, and in today's screen-welded-to-your-face age, you may not even be present when someone first makes your acquaintance. A Facebook photo, blog post, or tweet is as good as a handshake. But that handshake that seemed so firm and reassuring online? Yeah, it could be limp as hell in real life. It's probably pretty safe to say that we've all been intrigued by someone's online presence at one time or another: a cute mutual friend on Facebook, a blogger with a particularly attractive headshot, a minor celebrity with a penchant for oversharing. Some of us may have even struck up relationships with said objects of affection, trading e-mails, texts and phone calls into the night -- forming attachments with people we've never, essentially, met. Read more: Three boneheaded online dating moves to avoid . And therein lies the rub: An online connection isn't necessarily a real-life success, and people aren't always who they say they are. So how should you prepare to take an onscreen relationship off? To supply you with the necessary tools, we turned to the experts: Nev Schulman and filmmaker Max Joseph, from MTV's new reality series, ""Catfish: The TV Show."" ""Catfish"" (airing on Monday nights at 11 p.m. ET/PT), is based on the documentary by the same name. In the movie, Schulman meets and falls in love with a woman online who is not exactly (or at all) who she says she is. After the release of the film, thousands of people turned to him and asked if he would help them meet their online beaux IRL. Here are some of the lessons Schulman and Joseph have learned along the way. 1. Ask to Skype or video chat before meeting . ""If the person is hesitant or reluctant, reconsider meeting,"" Joseph says. 2. Don't be scared to stalk . ""Spend a good two hours looking the person up on Facebook, Google, Myspace, and Instagram. It's not spying, it's virtual contraception."" Joseph says you may want to reconsider if: . -- They have fewer than 100 friends on Facebook, . -- They are a model-slash-something else incredible (e.g. model/doctor) -- None of their photos are tagged . -- They are talking primarily to a ton of other guys or girls who don't seem to know them personally . 3. Dress down . ""You would be shocked how casual people tend to be when meeting their online crushes and you don't wanna feel awkwardly overdressed,"" Schulman says. 4. Don't do it at your home . ""The last thing you want is some stranger knowing where you live,"" he says. 5. Have an activity planned . ""Sitting across from somebody for coffee or dinner can get real awkward real fast. Better to make it a social event and go bowling or something,"" Schulman suggests. 6. Bring a friend and an open mind .

"(CNN) -- A week of critical diplomacy is set to begin in Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang. But the sides are so far apart, at least in public declarations, it is impossible to predict where any diplomatic efforts will lead. North Korea continues to hold fast to the position that its nuclear and ballistic missile programs are non-negotiable. Pyongyang's official news agency says the North wants U.N. Security Council sanctions lifted. The sanctions were put in place after North Korea launched a three-stage rocket last December that put a satellite in orbit. More sanctions were added when the North conducted its third underground nuclear test in February. The U.S. and South Korea insist that a verifiable path to dismantling those programs must be on the table for any negotiating process to begin. South Koreans are increasingly saying they may need a nuclear deterrent to counter Pyongyang's threats. China, of course, detests the possibility the U.S. would reintroduce strategic nuclear weapons there. (They were removed in 1991.) Everyone is heaping pressure on China to rein in the North Koreans. Looking at the North's rapidly growing nuclear threat, some South Koreans admit that after years of dismissing all the bombastic rhetoric from Pyongyang, real fears are emerging. ""It really is a game changer,"" said Hahm Chaibong, president of the ASAN Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. ""We really don't know what to do with it because these are political weapons, these are psychological weapons."" North Korea outlines exacting terms for talks with U.S., South Korea . Wanted: Bold diplomatic moves (by the other guy) Hahm says the six-party talks don't evoke confidence anymore. In his view, what is needed is a bold, new strategy comparable to President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to Beijing credited with not only laying the groundwork for rapprochement with the U.S., but opening up China to the world. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is no Zhou Enlai. But Beijing may be hoping Washington will overlook that. ""The Chinese are very keen to just get back to any kind of talks,"" Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt told CNN. The International Crisis Group's Northeast Asia project director says more than one Chinese source has suggested a repeat of the Nixon-Zhou scenario. ""The Chinese regularly tell me, if (President) Obama would just pick up the phone and talk to Kim Jong Un, we could solve this whole thing!"" Don't hold your breath. Obama is in lockstep with his regional allies vowing not to reward Pyongyang's bad behavior. China is feeling more wanted than ever. The North Koreans have signaled their readiness to meet with anyone from Beijing. The U.S., Japan and South Korea have repeatedly and publicly declared that China holds the key to reining in the North. While Beijing raised its hand in the vote in favor of sanctions on Pyongyang, many believe it is staying that hand when it comes to enforcing them. ""If China is not active and China is not fully committed, I don't think this is an issue that can be resolved,"" says professor Lee Jung-Hoon of Seoul's Yonsei University. China has shown disdain for Kim's recent outbursts. But Beijing's No. 1 priority is keeping his regime from collapse and millions of hungry North Koreans on his side of the border. China is arguably sympathetic to young Kim's predicament. That's the reason, says Kleine-Albrandt and others, that China will not go as far as the U.S. and its partners in Asia would like. Nuclear weapons: Who has what? Understanding Kim Jong Un's predicament . ""We think they're blackmailing us right now, we think they want money from us,"" said John Delury, a professor of Northeast Asian studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. ""What we fail to understand is their profound insecurity."" Delury recalled the six-party talks, when U.S. diplomats were trying to persuade the North Koreans to denuclearize. ""We said, look, you'll be safe without your nuclear weapons, look at Libya!"" While almost no one inside North Korea has access to the real Internet, we can safely assume that Kim is the exception. We should also assume that the young leader has watched the grisly videos of Moammar Gadhafi being lynched by a mob of his own people. Kim may see his own face in that video. South Koreans are hardly sympathetic. ""There's growing public sentiment,"" says Lee Jung-Hoon, that ""we have to be very firm with this regime. It's good to have dialogue and, yes, we want to talk with North Korea. But it's a fading hope that somehow we could convince North Korea, through dialogue, to give up its nuclear weapons program. ""If that's the case, what's the point in engaging in dialogue? Shouldn't we now be focusing on beefing up our security so our deterrence, especially nuclear deterrence, is firm so we will not be vulnerable to these threats?"" Diplomacy to deal with North Korea is gathering momentum. But the vast difference in the positions of all the parties raises doubts about the outcome. If it fails, many predict Pyongyang will immediately subscribe to another round of missile or nuclear tests and the familiar, and destabilizing, sequence will begin anew.

"(CNN) -- Everyone seems to be buzzing about ""Accidental Racist,"" the new musical collaboration between country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J -- but this is not the first such tag team from those two genres. Rap and country have intersected before, though not as controversially as the current pairing: ""Accidental Racist"" has touched off a firestorm for its subject matter and complaints that the song just isn't that great. Time's James Poniewozik wrote ""Country star and hip-hop star, trading lyrics and sharing billing for peace. Don't pre-judge! Don't assume the worst of people! What's not to like?"" ""Oh God, so much,"" Poniewozik wrote. ""The sappy ballad arrangement that sets up the confounding metaphors ('The red flag on my chest is somehow like the elephant / In the corner of the South / And I just walked him right in the room') and clunky lyrics ('I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood / I want you to get paid, but be a slave I never could')."" ""The basic misrepresentations of history, such as describing Reconstruction as mainly being when 'they ... Fixed the buildings, dried some tears.' The seriously questionable assumptions about the Starbucks employee dress code: ('Just because my pants are saggin' doesn't mean I'm up to no good' / 'Don't judge my do-rag')."" A CNN commentator named Robert said of was ""awful."" ""It's not even about racism -- it's about stereotypes, based on how a person dresses. Not all white people wear cowboy hats and not all black people sag their pants. That presumption alone is racist."" Country music star Jason Aldean dealt with charges that he was ""ruining country music"" when he paired up with rapper Ludacris last year for the single ""Dirt Road Anthem."" At the time, a blogger from SavingCountryMusic.com discussed the tune in a piece titled ""The Destruction of America's Distinct Musical Dialects."" ""Negative connotations in media about redneck culture are making many people in rural areas flee from their native habits to adopt customs more indigenous to urban locales, giving rise to country rap with artists like Colt Ford,"" the writer stated. ""Jason Aldean's country rap 'Dirt Road Anthem' was the best-selling song in country music last year for example. At the same time, the power of pop country is causing similar gentrification in suburban and urban zones as it encroaches into areas it is not indigenous to either."" LL Cool J's proud of 'Accidental Racist' Aldean took to Twitter to defend his choice of musical partners after the public railed against him. ""They were bashing the fact that I had him out there and said that I was ruining country music and all this kind of stuff,"" the singer told reporters at the time. ""That's when I went on (Twitter) and said, 'You know, if you don't like what I'm doing, nobody's forcing you to listen.' I just decided to fire back, which I never do."" Opinion: Don't be offended by 'Accidental Racist' Tim McGraw joined forces with Nelly in 2004 for ""Over and Over,"" a song which cracked the Billboard Top 10. While McGraw said he enjoyed working with the St. Louis rapper, he said he didn't consider the song part of his usual genre. ""It ain't nothin' country about this song,"" McGraw told MTV. ""But it was fun to get in there and sing with him,"" he said, adding, ""People are really liking the song."" More recently, Nelly joined country duo Florida Georgia Line for a remix of their song ""Cruise."" Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson seemed like more of a natural fit -- if for no other reason than their both high publicized love of a certain plant. Nelson sings ""Too many pain pills, too much pot/Tryin to be somethin that I'm not - Superman! Superman/Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand/I ain't Superman - know what I'm talkin' 'bout?"" The rapper follows that up with a little bit of singing himself.

"(CNN) -- Too weak to stand or walk, William M. LaFever sat in a shallow river bed in the south Utah desert, awaiting rescue that came more than a month after his family last heard from him. Thursday afternoon, a helicopter flying in the Escalante River gorge spied the bearded LaFever, 28, who had lost 50 pounds and eaten frogs and roots in his desperate effort to stay alive during his walk from a Utah city to Page, Arizona. ""We came around the corner and we were pretty amazed to see him alive and sitting up,"" Shane Oldfield, a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter pilot assisting the Garfield County Sheriff's Office, told CNN Friday. LaFever was hospitalized Friday in St. George, Utah, in stable condition. Family members told a deputy that he has autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder, said Becki Bronson, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. The Colorado Springs, Colorado, man's incredible odyssey began when he called his father on June 6 or 7 to tell him he was in Boulder, Utah, hiking with his dog, according to the sheriff's office. Rescued hiker: I messed up . LaFever said he had run out of money and someone had stolen some of his hiking gear. Authorities said they assumed he was given a ride to Boulder, as he did not have his own vehicle. ""He didn't want me to come out there,"" said LaFever's father, John LaFever. ""He wanted me to send him some money to get him to Page."" The elder LaFever said he wasn't sure how William would make it all the way to Page, but his son mentioned following the river. Within a week of his call home, William got a ride to where Highway 12 crosses the river, and set out on his journey. The younger LaFever apparently did not know the extent of the rigors he would face when he planned to walk nearly 50 miles in the Escalante Desert to Lake Powell and then obtain a boat ride, officials said. Eventually, LaFever's food and strength ran out as he continued walking, according to authorities, and his dog ran off. Officials were looking into a report that the animal may have been located, Bronson told CNN. With her brother long overdue, LaFever's sister called authorities Monday, seeking help and providing information on where he might be. Garfield County Deputy Ray Gardner accompanied Oldfield on the flight and told him he had learned in recent training that people with autism often are drawn to water. Oldfield said the hiker had apparently followed the river as he walked south and had been in the location where they found him for several days, sapped of almost all his strength. LaFever was only a few miles away from Lake Powell. Hikers rescued in Utah canyon . ""I think he probably hiked as far as he could until he was physically exhausted and he went into survival mode,"" the pilot said. LaFever had no compass and had discarded or lost his hiking gear. All he had were his pants, shoes, underwear, shirt and a lighter. He used the lighter to set a small fire at night, officials said, and then would roll into the river to stay cool and drink water. LaFever weakly waved when Gardner and Oldfield spotted him from the air. After their landing, the pair approached the emaciated man, not certain of his identity. Initially, LaFever did not want to get into the helicopter. ""He was asking us for food but it was not like he was shoveling it down. He was casually eating a granola bar as he was talking to the deputy,"" said Oldfield. In a statement, Gardner said he had not been expecting a good outcome. ""We had no idea if William had stayed along the river, or decided to leave, or got a ride with someone, or was lost somewhere other than along the river,"" he said. ""We flew along it without any expectation of finding anything at all. The conditions would have to be just right too; unless he was out in the open there was no way we would be able to find him."" Gardner, praised by LaFever's family for his work on the case, did not immediately return a message left Friday by CNN. William LaFever was in an area popular with hikers, but was about 30 miles beyond where most venture, Oldfield said. ""He made the mistake 'I know what I am doing and I will be OK,''' Bronson told CNN. ""There are many who have done that and paid the price."" John LaFever said his son ""has done a lot of camping but he has always been close enough to where he could walk to people and get a grocery store. It has never been at this capacity."" William LaFever, who is on disability, will be hospitalized indefinitely as he regains his strength. ""I am just overwhelmed,"" said his father. ""I was really hoping he was alive. The chances of him being found alive were one in a million, maybe."" 3 Mt. Whitney hikers rescued .","Man survives more than three weeks in remote Utah desert .

"Washington (CNN) -- Broadcast television networks won an important constitutional fight Thursday when the Supreme Court said government regulators imposed unfair punishment for isolated profanity and sexual content during evening ""prime time"" hours. In an 8-0 vote, justices concluded the Federal Communications Commission cannot enforce its current policies against ""fleeting"" expletives and nudity on over-the-air programs, both live and scripted. The agency had levied hefty fines on all four major broadcasters beginning nearly a decade ago. The court's ruling was narrow, as the justices declined to address whether the regulations violate free-speech protections guaranteed under the First Amendment. But it does establish important guidelines the government must follow when monitoring explicit content on the airwaves. ""The commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority. The Justice Department had filed an appeal, and helpfully provided the justices with a DVD of a 2003 episode of the now-canceled ""NYPD Blue"" on ABC in which a naked woman was shown. The content of that program is central to the current legal dispute. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are all parties in the case. A federal appeals court last year for a second time struck down the government policies, concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied. Pending sanctions against the broadcasters were dismissed. Controversial words and images have been aired at times in scripted and unscripted shows on all the major over-the-air networks in the past eight years, dating back to when the FCC began considering a stronger, no-tolerance policy. The policy became known as the Golden Globes Rule, for singer Bono's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on NBC, where he uttered the phrase ""really, really, f---ing brilliant."" The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty-mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired live on Fox. Richie, in an apparent scripted moment said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple."" Opinion: FCC should clear Limbaugh from airwaves . While concluding the broadcasters' due process rights were violated when they were not given fair notice, the court did not foreclose future enforcement. ""This opinion leaves the commission free to modify its current policy,"" Kennedy wrote, ""in light of its determination of the public interest and applicable legal requirements. And it leaves the courts free to review the current policy or any modified policy in light of its content and application."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor did not participate in the decision, since she had heard the case when serving on a federal appeals court in New York, before joining her current job. A separate appeal involving singer Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"" and brief partial nudity on national television is pending at the high court. The justices are likely to throw the case back to the lower courts, in light of Thursday's ruling. The FCC said it would begin to immediately implement the policy. ""As a matter of good governance, it is now time for the FCC to get back to work so that we can process the backlog of pending indecency complaints -- which currently stands at just under 1.5 million involving about 9,700 TV broadcasts,"" said Commissioner Robert McDowell, ""Some of these complaints date back to 2003. We owe it to the American public and the broadcast licensees involved to carry out our statutory duties with all deliberate speed."" There was no immediate reaction from the broadcasters in the Fox and ABC cases. But a group opposing stricter government control over TV applauded the high court's ruling. ""Today's decision by the Supreme Court re-emphasizes what we have been advocating all along: That parents, not the government, are the best arbiters of what their children should be watching on TV,"" said TV Watch's executive director, Jim Dyke. ""In the one-third of American homes with children, parents have tools such as the V-chip and content ratings to help them make decisions about what their children watch based on the age of the child and their family's tastes and values."" Middle finger 'malfunction' mars Super Bowl halftime show . The high court two years ago ruled in favor of the FCC on the issue of ""fleeting expletives,"" concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast TV networks airing isolated cases of profanity. The court, however, refused both at that time and now to decide whether the commission's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, ruling only on the agency's enforcement power. The Justice Department, in this appeal, lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together, saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one. Explicit language is heard with greater, albeit varying, frequency on cable television, the Internet, and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints of ""indecent"" language and images on broadcast television and radio, which is subject to greater regulation. That is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours, when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching. The commission formally reversed its policy in March 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal. In addition, a voluntary rating system is used by all television networks to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired. Much of the enforcement debate centered around the ABC television stations fined $27,500 each for airing the ""NYPD Blue"" episode featuring a woman with her breasts and buttocks exposed. Another source of contention is whether broadcast radio and the TV networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and the CW -- should receive treatment differing from their satellite and cable cousins regarding content. Most broadcast stations are part of the basic cable packages people buy, and just 10% of the population receives its TV signals only through the airwaves. But the government countered that 69 million television sets are not connected to cable or satellite, and that broadcasting is the medium of choice for children. The Supreme Court first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978, when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian George Carlin on society's taboo surrounding ""seven dirty words."" The bit had received some radio airplay. The justices said ""context"" should be applied when deciding whether words or images are ""indecent."" The major broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words are permitted. Time Warner -- the parent company of CNN -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago. The company is part owner of the CW broadcast network and operates several cable networks. The case is FCC v. Fox Television Stations (10-1293).","The Supreme Court blocks FCC policies against ""fleeting"" expletives and nudity .

"(CNN) -- An online fundraiser for a New York bus monitor taunted by middle school students ends Friday after a month and hundreds of thousands of dollars beyond expectations. A 10-minute video of Karen Klein enduring verbal harassment from four students went viral last month, sparking international outrage that grew into a call to raise ""vacation"" funds for her. The video showed giggling students from the upstate New York community of Greece heaping insults onto her and jabbing her with a book. The grandmother of eight sits quietly, weeping at one point. It inspired a campaign through the international crowd-funding website, indiegogo.com, which started with an initial goal of raising $5,000. Within three days, the campaign raked in more than $600,000, according to data analysis on the website. Almost a month later and with hours left before the campaign officially closes Friday night, it has raised more than $683,000. Donations poured in from all over the United States and about 80 other countries. The most common donation was $10 while $3,000 was the single largest contribution, according to the data analysis. Indiegogo said Klein will get 93% of the funds while the website will keep 4% and 3% will go toward credit card processing fees. It is unclear when she will be presented with the funds or whether taxes will be applied now or later. Max Sidorov, the Toronto man who started the online fundraiser, said he was stunned by the generosity of strangers. ""I had no idea I was going to raise anywhere near this amount. I thought maybe a few thousand,"" Sidorov said last month. ""Maybe to send her somewhere nice. But this is enough for her to retire."" The incident occurred in Greece, near Rochester. Klein is a bus monitor for the Greece Central School District and the harassers hail from a district middle school. The verbal abuse continued unabated for about 10 minutes in the video recorded by a student with a cell phone camera and posted on YouTube on June 19, where it has had more than 8 million views. As the intimidation unfolded, Klein said she tried to disregard it, looking out of the window and counting down the seconds to when the students would get off the bus. Some of the students who taunted her in the video later apologized and expressed regret for their actions. The four boys caught on camera were suspended for a year. They will also be required to complete 50 hours of community service with senior citizens and take part in a formal bullying prevention program.","A video of middle school students tormenting Karen Klein goes viral .

"(CNN) -- The Chilean government has promised a speedy investigation into a viral video of its naval cadets that has offended three neighboring nations. The amateur video shows a bloc of cadets running on a public street, repeating the cadence of their instructor: ""Argentineans I will kill; Bolivians I will shoot; Peruvians I'll behead."" Chile is not at war with any of the countries. ""Without a doubt, they are shameful images,"" Chilean government spokeswoman Cecilia Perez said. ""These types of actions do not represent the good relations that our country has with the fellow countries mentioned, and the peace Chile has always wanted to achieve and maintain in our region."" Historically, Chile has had rivalries and disputes with its neighbors. Landlocked Bolivia lost its access to the Pacific Ocean to Chile in a war, for example, and it continues to fight for a sliver of coast. ""Chile is a country that generates controversy in the region without justification, behaving in a way that does not foster confidence-building or peace in South America,"" Bolivia's defense ministry said in a statement. The incident violates Chile's allegiance to the tenets of the United Nations and Organization of American States charter, the ministry said. In a radio interview, Argentina Defense Minister Arturo Puricelli called the video ""truly unacceptable."" He said it may be an isolated incident, but he expects a swift resolution from Chile. Chile's defense minister gave his subordinates 24 hours to uncover what is behind the video. Peru's defense minister, Pedro Cateriano, expressed support for a swift investigation. ""They are condemnable remarks, but thankfully the Chilean authorities have reacted in a quick manner, and to that end we have confidence in them to clarify the incident,"" he said. The cadet video surfaced after a report by the country's National Institute of Youth showed intolerance among the country's young people. Gypsies, people with mental disabilities and homosexuals are groups most often discriminated against among the young, the group reported. Former cadet and Chilean Congressman Gonzalo Arenas called the reaction an ""embarrassment."" ""Those songs have always existed in all the armed forces,"" he said on his Twitter account. Arenas said he sang the same cadences when he was a cadet more than 20 years ago.","A video shows Chilean cadets singing an offensive cadence .

"(CNN) -- Tito Vilanova stepped down as Barcelona coach Friday after the Spanish champions revealed he needed fresh treatment in his battle against cancer. Club president Sandro Rosell and sporting director Andoni Zubizaretta made the announcement at a specially convened media conference at the Nou Camp. The 44-year-old Vilanova led the Catalan giants to the La Liga title last season after succeeding Pep Guardiola in June 2012. But he spent nearly three months on the sidelines after having surgery followed by a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in New York. Vilanova, a long-time assistant to Guardiola, had first been diagnosed with a cancerous tumor of the throat in November 2011, but after having initial treatment returned to work in less than three weeks. He was appointed to the top job when his old boss quit and under his charge Barcelona made a storming start to last season. After his return in March following his treatment, they wrapped up the domestic title, but suffered a semifinal humiliation to Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals. Vilanova had been preparing his squad for the new season, but following news of his fresh health problems, the club announced their trip to Poland for a friendly with Lechia Gdansk Saturday had been canceled. Barcelona said assistant coach Joan Francesc Ferrer Sicilia would take temporary charge and Rosell said a new coach would be appointed ""probably early next week."" Vilanova's battle with cancer has occurred in tandem with Eric Abidal, the French international defender, who was diagnosed with a liver tumor. When Barcelona clinched their 22nd La Liga title last season, club captain Carles Puyol stepped aside to allow Vilanova and Abidal to initially lift the trophy in recognition of their brave battles against illness. Abidal left the Catalan giants at the end of the season when he was not offered a fresh playing contract. Several Barcelona players, including Argentina star Lionel Messi and Puyol, attended Friday's announcement of Vilanova's latest setback.","Tito Vilanova steps down as coach of Spanish champions Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman's attorney says he's worried about the effect the ""insensitive"" tweets from his client's brother will have on the already controversial Trayvon Martin murder case. Mark O'Mara says Robert Zimmerman -- whose tweets mentioned the suspect in the recent killing of a baby in Georgia and Martin -- does not represent his brother or the defense. ""Having said that, I'm not sure where (Robert's) heart was, but I've always said for the past year that we have to have a conversation about race, and the Zimmerman case has brought it to the forefront, particularly the way young black males are treated in the system,"" O'Mara said Thursday on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""These type of tweets ... were insensitive to that, and quite honestly are the opposite of what I hope the conversation would be to try and figure out what's wrong with the system and maybe a good way to fix it."" O'Mara said everything that happens in Zimmerman's case is already ""hyper-focused upon."" ""... And certainly when a family member of my client says something that comes across as totally insensitive -- if not much, much worse -- (it) has an effect, and now we have to deal with it."" George Zimmerman acknowledges he shot and killed Martin last year in Sanford, Florida, but said it was in self-defense. His brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., recently tweeted a photograph of Martin and one of 17-year-old De'Marquise Elkins, one of two teenagers charged with killing a baby in Georgia. Both teens are black. In their photos, Elkins and Martin, 17, appear to be flipping off the camera. ""A picture speaks a thousand words. Any questions?"" Robert Zimmerman's tweet reads. Another tweet Robert Zimmerman posted: ""Lib media shld ask if what these2 black teens did 2 a woman&baby is the reason ppl think blacks mightB risky."" Speaking on CNN's Piers Morgan Live on Wednesday night, he apologized for the messages, saying they weren't the ""right thing to do."" ""I realize those were controversial and offensive and I did publicly apologize for them,"" he said. ""I'm a human being. I'm being upfront about what I did. I made a mistake ... Unfortunately (it) may not have helped George."" 5 things to know about the case . George Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder in Martin's death. Attorneys for Martin's family have accused Zimmerman of racially profiling the 17-year-old and shooting him ""in cold blood."" Robert Zimmerman Jr. said he was trying to make a larger point in his tweets about the ""media and their honesty in portraying the person who encountered my brother February 26, 2012. ""We've been led to believe that it's a junior-high-school-aged person because of the pictures,"" he said, referring to Martin. ""The analogy is these are two people who chose to represent themselves in this way. One was accused of killing a baby, and whatever's in his social media makes the rounds immediately ... However, the other person who almost killed my brother had he disarmed him -- my brother had every indication to believe he would have killed him -- his social media is off limits."" Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said he agrees with O'Mara that someone should not be judged for what they tweet. ""But when it comes to Trayvon, they attempt to posthumously judge a dead teenager by his tweets and social media,"" Crump said on ""Starting Point"" Thursday. ""And that is the problem here. You cannot know what is in a person's heart by reading a tweet."" The Zimmerman defense, Crump said, is seeking to introduce his client's social media activity as evidence in court. ""That's just not right,"" he argued. ""Starting Point"" host Soledad O'Brien asked Crump about a witness identified as #9, which both she and Crump said is a cousin of George Zimmerman. The cousin called police a short time after Martin's shooting. ""Growing up they always made ...him and his family made statements like that they don't like black people if they don't act like white people. They like black people if they act white and other than that they talk a lot of bad things about black people,"" O'Brien read from the transcript of the call. ""Is this something that's going to be admissible in court?"" she asked Crump. The attorney replied that Robert Zimmerman's tweets ""bolster"" the testimony of that particular witness.","NEW: George Zimmerman's attorney said he is concerned about how tweets could affect case .

"(CNN) -- ""Think before you speak"" must be high up on the job description for the modern central banker. Few people hold the power to send markets into fever panic or bullish euphoria by words alone. But every time a head of a major central bank takes to a podium, holds a press conference or sits before a panel of politicians, these characteristically modest officials shoulder the weight of the global economy as markets scavenge for clues as to the bank's next policy move. This week, it was once again Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's turn, when he faced lawmakers in his semi-annual testimony to Congress and the Senate. With his last three public appearances leading to large swings in the markets, Bernanke took a softer tone to reassure Wall Street that the Federal Reserve was still providing the necessary backstop for the U.S. economy through its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. Read more: Bernanke: Congress still a risk to the economy . Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, told CNN that Bernanke's appearance in Congress was the final part of an ""incredibly clever"" three-pronged strategy by the Federal Reserve to ""play"" the markets. Investors have become ""addicted"" to QE, according to Rundle, and by Fed members speaking out publicly about tapering the program, the central bank is trying to wean the markets off the QE drug. Read more: The most important distinction Bernanke still needs to make . Last month, Bernanke hinted the Fed may start to trim bond purchases later this year and end the program around the middle of 2014 if the economy meets its forecasts for growth of 2.3% to 2.6% for 2013. Rundle said that by signaling a gradual slowdown in its asset-purchases program, the Fed wants to stem complacency and any repeat of the excessive risk-taking that led to the financial crisis in 2007. He said: ""Universally, every Fed member started talking about the possibility of tapering about three or four months ago... there will be small tapering in September... $5 billion to $10 billion maybe [of the $85 billion a month program]."" Read more: Bernanke: Tapering plan not a ""preset course"" And the chairman -- who is set to step down in January 2014 -- is confident the plan is working. During his testimony, he said: ""I think the markets are beginning to understand our message and, you know, the [market] volatility has moderated."" Read more: Fed dissenter argues for tapering QE3 . Together with the Fed's near-zero interest rates, improving economic data is also beginning to buoy the U.S. economy. As of June, the unemployment rate was 7.6%, and Fed officials expect it to fall to around 7.25% by the end of the year. Meanwhile, inflation has remained below the Fed's target of 2% per year. Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Societe General in London, warns that markets and investors cannot expect central banks to fix everything and must ""be careful not to over interpret every single little word"" that central bank leaders say. She cites the role of the European Central Bank and its President Mario Draghi in the eurozone debt crisis as an example of where governments must take responsibility when central banks cannot. Last year at the ECB's monthly press conference, Draghi stated that the euro was ""irreversible"" and the central bank would do everything within its power to ensure the future of the euro area. The mere utterance of those robust statements immediately took the sting out of the eurozone crisis; borrowing costs for struggling Italy and Spain dropped, the euro strengthened, markets rallied and the sheer power of central bank rhetoric became apparent to all. Marcussen told CNN: ""It's really interesting when you see what people listen to and what they don't listen to because if you look at every single press conference since then, Draghi has said that European policymakers need to move forward on banking union."" Despite the ECB's best efforts to reassure markets and support governments, through its announcement of an unlimited bond-purchasing program last year, dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions, the ECB has been reluctant to implement a fully-fledged quantitative easing program similar to that of the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. And Rundle believes simply announcing the plan is not enough, investors want action. He said: ""The ECB's program was just words. It was only the market that was giving it credibility by reacting... I don't think the ECB would have the power to stop the eurozone falling apart."" He added: ""Central banks are only good when they've got credibility and I don't know how the ECB can still have credibility... Markets have become reliant on central bankers for direction but this in itself is a creation of by the markets.""","Bernanke took a softer tone to reassure Wall Street that the Fed was still providing the necessary backstop .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- As chairman of Ferrari, Luca di Montezemolo is used to making things that move at breakneck speed. But rather than flashy sports cars for wealthy motor enthusiasts, the Italian businessman's latest high-velocity project aims to cater for the traveling masses. The Italo train from NTV -- a passenger rail company of which di Montezemolo is also chairman -- is a high-speed service that has been dashing between Milan, Rome and other major Italian cities since April. With its dark red color scheme, streamlined shape and speeds as fast as a formula-one car, everyone's calling Italo the ""Ferrari train."" A cinema carriage, free Wi-Fi access throughout the train, and luxury leather seats all add to the high-performance, luxury theme. But Italo is intended to be affordable and accessible to all consumers. Both Italo and state-run rival Trenitalia currently have promotional offers, but Trenitalia's flexible standard tickets from Rome to Milan start from $107 and go up to $200, whereas flexible standard tickets from Rome to Milan on Italo range from $110 to $163. ""Our idea was to do a train for everybody,"" di Montezemolo says. See also: In numbers: Europe's high-speed trains . He believes rail is the best way to travel in Europe and sees the emergence of NTV as a sign of rail renaissance. ""There are other trains in Europe but for me high-speed train will be the future of Europe,"" he says. While Italy has had high-speed trains since the late 1970s, NTV is the country's first rail operator not run by the state. Montezemolo and his consortium of partners, including French state rail company SNCF, have invested â‚¬1 billion ($1.2 billion) in NTV, breaking Trenitalia's monopoly. But Trenitalia was ready for Italo's arrival. It has spent $100 million upgrading the interiors of its Frecciarossa trains and introduced free Wi-Fi. It welcomes a new high-speed player and is prepared to fight for every customer. ""It's an opportunity for the consumer,"" says Trenitalia's Emanuele Carando. ""It's an opportunity for us to really demonstrate the power of Trenitalia and Frecciarossa ... and I think our numbers are really unbeatable. We are the first high-speed train in Italy ... we served 25 million consumers in the last year and I think our numbers are unbeatable."" Cameron Jones, vice president of rail industry technology specialists SilverRail, agrees that competition in the sector can benefit the consumer. ""Privatization and competition drives more efficient businesses,"" he says. ""With more efficient businesses those benefits and savings can be passed on to customers. So service gets better, product gets better and pricing gets better."" The expansion of other rail operators across Europe is having a similar effect, says Jones. ""Competition is driving a customer approach to rail ... and not just in Italy,"" he says. ""We can see that with (German rail company) Deutsche Bahn announcing they're coming into London to compete with Eurostar. Eurostar has invested Â£700 million in upgrading their entire fleet and adding 10 new trains in the fleet."" See also: California's high speed train to nowhere?

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Samina Rajput speaks in hushed tones about her husband, Asif, who was killed alongside former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in the December 27 attack that convulsed the nation. Suicide bombings have killed 400 people and wounded nearly 1,000 others in the last three months. ""He always used to say ... 'I am ready to sacrifice my life for the party and my country,'"" Rajput says. She clings to a weathered book with newspaper clippings of her husband, a 28-year-old Bhutto supporter who had great political ambitions. He wanted a brighter and freer Pakistan, Rajput says, as she turns the delicate pages of the scrapbook. The clippings on the faded pages offer little comfort. But a picture of their wedding day less than two years ago, buried among the pages, makes her face light up somewhat. ""As the widow of a martyr, one has to keep dignity, and I will do this up to my last breath,"" Rajput says, clasping her hands and rubbing them together. Suicide bombings like the attack that killed Bhutto and more than 20 of her supporters, including Asif, have intensified in recent months in Pakistan.  Watch the devastating effects of bombings » . On Thursday, a suicide bomber killed at least 23 people and injured more than 58 others outside a court in Lahore, police said. The attack brought to 20 the number of suicide attacks in Pakistan in the last three months, including a failed attack on Bhutto's life in October.  The bombings have killed close to 400 people and wounded nearly 1,000 others in the last three months, according to government officials. Pro-Taliban militants with ties to al Qaeda are carrying out the attacks, according to analysts and government officials. CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen says the number of suicide bombings in Pakistan has ""reached unprecedented levels in the past year."" Previously, Bergen says, such attacks were rare. ""The reason for this rise is because al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban have morphed together ideologically and tactically, and both see themselves at war with the Pakistani state,"" Bergen says. ""Many of the suicide attacks have been aimed at Pakistani politicians, officials and soldiers."" Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has vowed to fight militancy and religious extremism, going after Taliban and al Qaeda within the country. Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, recently told CNN that the Pakistani military is ""totally focused on destroying al Qaeda and the Taliban network and not just one person."" Still, the suicide bombers are succeeding, targeting political parties, rallies, military installations and anyone seen as a threat. Meanwhile, civilians are caught in the crossfire. ""They would like to destabilize our country,"" Azhar Hamdani, who survived a July attack, says of suicide bombers. Clutching a walker, Hamdani recalls the blast that changed his life. On July 17, 2007, a suicide bomber targeted a rally for Pakistani Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, who was stripped of power by Musharraf. The explosion killed at least 12 people and wounded 35 others in the capital, Islamabad. Hamdani remembers a strong blast throwing him several yards. When he regained consciousness, he was missing his left eye and his right leg was severely injured. ""My leg was totally damaged,"" he says. ""My one left eye was damaged and I have several other injuries on my body."" But at the time of the blast, Hamdani was not focused on his own pain, he says, because he was surrounded by the bodies of his dead friends lying in pools of blood. The bombings, he says, must be stopped. ""I hope that we will succeed and, God willing, we will try to stop these bloody cowards,"" he says. ""I don't think they are Muslim.""

"(TIME.com) -- Want to get in shape, but just don't have the time? We found a workout that can scorch calories in as few as four minutes. Logging an hour-long run on the treadmill may be great exercise, but it can be mind-numbingly dull. And while there are lots of other unique workouts and quirky classes to be had at the gym nowadays, they're not for everyone. Plus, they all require at least 45 minutes or an hour of your time. So with my fellow time-strapped workout warriors in mind, I sampled the Tabata class at Equinox in New York City and discovered that its condensed ""Get-R-Done"" workout style is a potential solution for the ""I don't have time"" excuse. TIME.com: We tried Barry's Bootcamp . Tabata Protocol is a scientifically proven method to boost endurance in only about 25 minutes or so. It's based on studies of high-intensity intermittent training by Japanese researcher Izumi Tabata. In his original 1996 study, Tabata monitored athletes as they cycled at their absolute highest intensity — 170% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) — for 20 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of rest. This was done for four minutes at a time, for a total of up to eight cycles. Gyms and studios have adopted the technique and made it their own by adding music, equipment and various exercises to their classes, but the timed intervals typically remain the same. If followed correctly, Tabata should fatigue even the most fit gym bunnies. TIME.com: We tried SLT Megaformer workout . In my Equinox class, instructor Amanda Young led us in rounds of high-intensity step-ups, lunges and push-ups. Twenty seconds never felt longer. ""In this format, you have an increase in your two energy systems: both the aerobic and the anaerobic,"" says Young. ""This is almost like a sprint, so a lot of athletes use this method. In a football game for example, it's very start-stop-start-stop. Using your anaerobic systems helps you build your endurance to do this."" TIME.com: Aerial Vinyasa (or upside-down) yoga . The key to Tabata is pushing yourself to the wall of your peak performance at every interval — you know, that point at which you feel as if you will pass out or pass up your lunch. Each exercise has modifications for optimal performance. During the push-up sequence, for example, I opted for run-of-the-mill push-ups while the body-builder next to me clapped between each one. Even though regular aerobic-style workouts like long-distance running and sculpting classes may burn more calories than Tabata for the duration of the exercise, Young argues that her class participants see the difference in the hours following the workout. ""During the 24 to 36 hours after your workout, there is an increase in your resting metabolic rate,"" she explains. ""Basically, you are going to burn more fat over the next 24 to 36 hours than you normally would — as opposed to if you were doing a steady state workout like running on a treadmill."" TIME.com: We tried the Urban Rebounding workout . You can easily adapt the workout to fit your own gym routines. If you're training for a run or a bike race, for example, you can apply the 20 seconds on/10 seconds rest model to your exercise of choice to best meet your training needs. But don't go overboard, Young warns. She recommends doing Tabata two to three times a week at most. ""Your body will be too taxed to do it every day. You don't really want to do any workout every day. The more you vary your workouts, the more benefits you will see,"" she says. As long you're cognizant of your personal fitness level, anyone can participate in Tabata. Just don't forget to stretch afterward.

"(CNN) -- Sony's PlayStation Network, the gaming and entertainment platform knocked offline for weeks this spring, has been hit again. In a message to members, Phillip Reitenger, Sony's chief information security officer, said the company detected an attempt to try a massive number of user IDs and passwords on its network. The PlayStation Network and Sony Online Entertainment were impacted, Reitenger said. But unlike the spring attack, when virtually every one of the PlayStation Network's 70 million subscribers lost total access, only one-tenth of 1 percent (about 93,000 people divided between PSN and Online Entertainment) had their information accessed and were locked down, the company said. Only a small percentage of those accounts showed suspicious activity after they were accessed, he said. ""We want to take this opportunity to remind our consumers about the increasingly common threat of fraudulent activity online, as well as the importance of having a strong password and having a username/password combination that is not associated with other online services or sites,"" Reitenger wrote. ""We encourage you to choose unique, hard-to-guess passwords and always look for unusual activity in your account."" No credit card information was accessed in the hack, according to the letter. Network customers who were affected received an e-mail from Sony notifying them of the issue. Everyone who is affected is required by Sony to change their passwords on the network. The PlayStation Network went down on April 20 after a Web attack on the network, which lets people download games and videos and play them with each other online. Most players couldn't use the network for weeks and it wasn't completely restored until the PlayStation Store went back online in early June. A London 19-year-old allegedly affiliated with the hacker group LulzSec was arrested in late June in connection with the Sony attack. LulzSec, purportedly a spin-off of the bigger hacker collective Anonymous, posted what they claim is proprietary information from Sony Pictures and other Sony properties' websites online. At June's E3 video-gaming expo, Sony Computer Entertainment of America president Jack Tretton apologized to players for the outages. He called it the ""elephant in the room"" and thanked gamers for staying loyal during the down time. ""You are the lifeblood of this company. Without you there is no Playstation,"" Tretton said. ""I want to apologize, both personally and on behalf of the company, for any anxiety we caused you. Many users had responded angrily in the spring, with many of their complaints centering around the week Sony took between the hack and making it known to players. This time, comments on Reitenger's online post seemed more positive. ""Thanks for letting everyone know so soon,"" one user wrote. ""It's better to be aware."" ""This is good that your letting us know this before everyone goes in another rage,"" said another.","Sony PlayStation Network hacked -- again .

"(CNN) -- Townsend Farms is recalling bags of a frozen fruit mix commonly used in smoothies because they could be contaminated with the hepatitis A virus, the company said in a statement. Townsend's Organic Antioxidant Blend is suspected in an outbreak of the virus that has affected five Western states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thirty-four people have been infected with hepatitis A, and 11 of them have been hospitalized as of Monday. Infections have been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, the CDC website said Tuesday. Nineteen of the 25 ill people interviewed by the CDC reported eating the Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend. The fruit mix with contaminated ingredients was sent to Costco stores and Harris Teeter stores. At Costco, the recalled codes include T012415 through T053115; consumers can find these on the back of the package near the words ""BEST BY."" Harris Teeter packages have ""BEST BY"" codes of T041615E or T041615C. The outbreak has been traced to pomegranate seeds from Turkey that are in the Townsend Farms fruit mix, according to the company statement. The mix contains pomegranate seeds and other produce from Argentina, Chile and the United States. ""There is no indication that cherries and other berries are contaminated,"" said William E. Gaar, an attorney for Townsend Farms. State health departments, the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC continue to investigate. The company was notified about the outbreak Thursday by the CDC, which sent investigators to the Townsend Farms processing plant in Fairview, Oregon, Gaar said. Hepatitis A is usually transmitted via contaminated food or water, or by someone who's infected, according to the Mayo Clinic website. Frequent hand-washing is recommended to limit the spread of hepatitis A. The highly contagious infection inflames the liver and limits its ability to function. ""Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment, and most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage,"" the Mayo Clinic website says. Severe cases can lead to liver failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A annually worldwide. Consumers who may have eaten the contaminated product should contact their doctor, and the product should be thrown away immediately. CNN's Jacque Wilson and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Townsend Farms recalls Organic Antioxidant Blend containing frozen fruit .

"(CNN) -- On a day when a report showed English Premier League clubs attract nearly EUR 150m ($193m) through shirt sponsorship deals, Newcastle United announced one of the biggest -- and most controversial -- in their history. The club has signed a four-year contract with 'digital finance company' Wonga, a pay-day firm one MP claims is nothing more than a ""legal loan shark."" Named as the number one company in the Sunday Times Tech Track 100 list in 2011, Wonga lends money with an annual interest rate of 4,124%. The company, which is named after a slang term for money in Britain, declined to comment when contacted by CNN. ""We are completely transparent about the total cost of repayment and we make money when our customers repay us quickly, not by continually extending a growing line of credit,"" says Wonga's website. ""Like all companies we make the odd mistake, but we are serious about our commitment to responsible lending and try to put customers at the heart of what we do."" As well as sponsoring Newcastle's shirts, Wonga has also bought the naming rights to the Magpies' stadium, reverting it back to its original St James' Park name. The club's owner Mike Ashley sparked a huge wave of protest from fans when he discarded 119 years of history by calling the ground the Sports Direct Arena, after his sports goods firm, back in 2011. Several key figures have criticized Ashley for striking the deal, saying it is irresponsible for such a big institution in a traditionally deprived area to carry the name of a firm that preys on vulnerable people. The partnership -- said to be worth $38m over four years -- underlines how increasingly important shirt deals are to top clubs, with a study by Sport+Markt showing they had pushed through the EUR 500m ($643m) barrier in Europe for the first time in 2012. Sport+Markt's report also reveals the most common shirt sponsor of Premier League clubs are firms from the betting and lottery sector, products of which are featured on the strips of six teams. British sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN one of the most important goals for sponsors is getting as many people as possible to see their brand name. The Premier League, with its estimated 4.7 billion viewers a year, is the perfect vehicle, he said. ""Such is the global prominence of the Premier League and the clubs within it, that shirt sponsors predictably and inevitably secure the 'eyeballs' they seek by engaging in sponsorship deals. ""In particular, there is a preponderance of gambling companies, largely because of the convergence of consumer interest in both football and gambling. ""In the case of Newcastle, there would appear to be an alignment of club and company expectations. ""For the club, the deal is an immediate source of revenue and also a smart way of returning United's stadium back to its St James' Park name; for the sponsor, given the socio-demographic and economic conditions of certain parts of the north-east, it is one way of targeting actual and potential customers."" Barcelona currently holds the record for the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal -- the Qatar Foundation pays the Spanish giants $38 million a year to have their logo emblazoned on the famous red and blue strip. English clubs Manchester United and Liverpool both attract $32 million a year in shirt deals, from AON and Standard Chartered respectively, while Barca's Spanish rivals Real Madrid receive $29m from betting firm Bwin. Newcastle's commercial income trails way behind those clubs despite their windfall from Wonga but according to Labour's Newcastle Central Member of Parliament Chi Onwurah, it is the wrong message to have on their shirts. ""Some of the richest young men in Newcastle to wear shirts calling on the poorest to go to a legal loan shark,"" she said on micro-blogging site Twitter. Her Labour colleague, Catherine McKinnell, agreed and called on the government to cap the interest rate companies like Wonga could charge. ""Pay-day lenders prey on the most vulnerable people in society, namely those on low incomes or unemployed,"" she said on her official website. ""I know of many cases where constituents have turned to pay-day lenders in desperation and find themselves trapped in a cycle of debt at excessive interest rates of over 4,000% per annum. ""During this double-dip recession, Wonga have seen their profits soar as many households struggle to make their income stretch to cover the rising costs of living. ""I am disappointed that the board has chosen to associate our club, brand and city with practices which too often penalise struggling families. ""I worry that by associating the club with such a company, it could normalize their practice and plunge many more families into the cycle of debt. Many will see this deal as money from misery."" Over the last two years Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow -- who dubbed pay-day loan companies as ""legal loan sharks"" -- has led a campaign against Wonga, including its sponsorship of the Blackpool and Hearts football clubs. Creasy want the government to impose a legal cap on lending rates as happens in most other European countries.","English Premier League leads the way in lucrative shirt sponsorship deals .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Get your dance shoes on. Korean singer Psy, who became a worldwide sensation with his smash hit ""Gangnam Style,"" is making another attempt at a global phenomenon. He performs his sequel, ""Gentleman,"" live for the first time Saturday, hoping to avoid the fate of other one-hit wonders. His video for ""Gangnam Style"" was the most viewed clip on YouTube with a staggering 1.5 billion views -- and growing. More than 50,000 fans are expected to pack Seoul's World Cup Stadium on Saturday to see ""Gentleman,"" a performance that will be streamed live on YouTube. The concert comes against a backdrop of increasing tension in the region amid North Korea's belligerent rhetoric and nuclear threats. But it's business as usual for many in Seoul. Neither the government nor concert organizers are concerned about any additional security measures for such a massive gathering, and tickets have been selling fast. ""The thought of danger never even occurred to me,"" said Seoul resident Sungoh Bang, who plans on attending the concert with a group of friends. ""Gentleman"" and ""Psy"" were two of the most searched for keywords on South Korea's biggest online portal, Naver, on Thursday, as Psy posted a snippet of his new dance. But fans and critics eager to see the rapper's new video in full will have to wait longer. ""We wrapped the music video shoot on Tuesday, and its in the editing phase right now,"" YG Entertainment public relations representative Hwang Min-hee told CNN. ""It's rather difficult to say when it will be released because we don't know how long the editing will take."" The music video was produced by the same team behind ""Gangnam Style,"" and will feature K-pop girl group member Ga-In of Brown Eyed Girls.

"(CNN) -- The home of a Syrian musician's family was ransacked this week, an act viewed as further intimidation by security forces angry at his views about the government. Malek Jandali, a renowned composer and pianist in Syria, told CNN Saturday that he learned from close sources that two armed security officers broke into his family's Homs residence and looted and destroyed furniture. The house was empty because his parents had fled to the United States. Jandali, an American citizen living in Atlanta, says he believes security forces targeted his family because of his pro-opposition performances. He said he hoped his music would promote harmony, peace and understanding, but he believes a July performance in Washington prompted thugs to assault his parents. He says the Thursday night break-in was retaliation for the publication of his parents' photos after the beating. Images posted on Facebook showed evidence of a brutal beating. Jandali thinks the forces didn't know his parents had fled their home. ""When they couldn't find anybody, they looted the house,"" he said. A security camera in the house recorded their movements, Jandali said. The Syrian government crackdown against protesters began in mid-March, with death tolls estimated to be high as 3,000. The government's stance has been widely deplored over the world. The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Friday that ""prominent human rights defenders, inside and outside the country"" and ""families and sympathizers of the protesters"" are reported to have been targeted by security forces. Malek Jandali says his parents -- Dr. Mamoun Jandali, 73, and Linah Droubi 66 -- have been among such family members targeted. The July attack unfolded as Mamoun Jandali was carrying groceries from his car to his home in Homs. A man grabbed him from behind and asked him to help care for someone who had been injured. When the surgeon, agreed to do so, the man spoke into his cell phone and said to bring the patient. Moments later, two other men showed up unaccompanied by any patient. They handcuffed the doctor, covered his mouth and nose with duct tape, then took him upstairs. Linah was in bed at the time. The three men beat the father and pummeled the mother brutally, causing severe injuries to her face. They locked them both in their bathroom, and ransacked the house. They were bleeding and stuck in the dark during the ransacking, . Mamoun held onto his cell phone during the ordeal. After the attackers left, Linah grabbed the cell phone and called relatives. They in turn called political security forces, the only ones who could unlock the handcuffs. They decided to leave Syria after they were assaulted last summer. They moved from one house to the next for a while to stay safe. With the help of the U.S. State Department, they were able to obtain visas to get to the United States. Mamoun arrived in Atlanta a few days ago. Linah arrived in Detroit a few weeks ago where she is staying with another son, Rami Jandali, a prosthodontist. She is getting medical treatment and she will eventually go to Atlanta to reunite with her husband. Mamoun Jandali told CNN the assault was ""unexpected."" ""I thank God that they didn't kill us,"" he said. ""They referred to my son Malek"" and said ""this is a lesson to teach you how to raise your son Malek."" Asked about life in Syria, the doctor described a country in turmoil. Citing reports of wounded demonstrators seized by security forces, Jandali said he has been asked to treat people in their homes because they are afraid to go to the hospitals. He said he ""can't imagine"" there would be people who would force doctors to stop anesthesia and end operations and then take away the wounded. A recent Human Rights Watch report has accounts of security force hospital raids. ""People are angry because there is no human rights,"" he said. ""The regime is very brutal in its behavior with the demonstrators."" He thinks the problems there can be solved if the ruling Baath Party's power becomes limited and President Bashar al-Assad resigns. ""Personally, I think this regime will not respond to any advice, to any statement telling him to step down,"" he said. ""They think they have this land as a heritage."" He said the economy is worsening and soldiers are leaving the army. He ponders the specter of more instability. ""If it does go in this way, we will have civil war or some countries from outside will come and help one group against the other,"" he said.

"Baltimore (CNN) -- Erika Brannock, a survivor of the Boston Marathon bombing, anxiously purses her lips. Her eyes jump and she is quick to smile and laugh. This is what someone looks like waiting to meet the person, a stranger, who she believes saved her life. ""I told my cousin last night that it's kind of like the night before Christmas, where you're so excited, but nervous at the same time and you can't sleep,"" Brannock told CNN's AC360 on Wednesday. 'Ready to go home': Last victim, Brannock, leaves the hospital . Brannock is about to meet Amanda North, a woman who took her hand and did not let go. The day of the marathon, the two women were standing near the finish line when the bombs went off. North was there to watch her daughter run, while Brannock was supporting her mom. Brannock was seriously injured. She suffered bone and tissue damage, eventually requiring the amputation of her lower left leg. North was also injured. Like Brannock, her eardrums were busted. She had cuts and lacerations on her leg. But in the immediate aftermath of the blast, North was unaware of her own injuries. She just saw Brannock, who was clearly hurt more than she, and jumped in to help, offering her belt as a tourniquet for Brannock's leg. Boston bombings destroy dancer's foot, but not her spirit . ""She had heard me screaming for help and she said, 'My name is Joan from California, and I'm not going to let you go.' And she stayed with me the whole time,"" Brannock recalled. In the chaos of that moment, she heard Joan, rather than Amanda. North thought Brannock's name was Irene. They'd laugh about the mix-up later. On Monday, Brannock left a Boston hospital after 11 surgeries and 50 days -- the last of the more than 250 victims to be released. She spoke to AC360, saying that she desperately wanted to find and thank the woman she knew then as Joan. CNN put out the alert, creating an e-mail address for tips. Just hours after the show aired, one rolled in. After disasters, hospitals pay it forward . 'That's me' The subject line of the note was as simple as it was clear: ""That's me."" North's friends had seen the AC360 segment and told her about the search. Family members also reached out. CNN arranged to fly North, who lives in Woodside, California, to Baltimore, where Brannock is undergoing physical therapy at Kernan Hospital. Like Brannock, North was a little anxious. ""In a way, she's a stranger to me, but when you share things like this you feel like you've known someone your entire life,"" she said. ""So I'm looking forward to meeting her, but I'm a little nervous."" Moments later, raw emotion flowed. North walked into a room where Brannock was waiting. Neither women said a word as they cried and embraced. ""I have thought about you every moment since the marathon,"" North said. ""I didn't know how to get a hold of you. I didn't know what had happened to you."" Like old friends, they exchanged gifts. Brannock gave North a necklace -- a dragonfly -- to match one she wears. The dragonfly has become a bit of a mascot for Brannock, who sees it as a symbol of strength and courage. North gave Brannock her favorite scarf. ""I want you to just think of me whenever you wear this, know that I'm always there for you. It never goes away. We're friends for life,"" she said. ""I'm never going to stop holding your hand.""

"(CNN) -- France is en vogue at the moment. Its parliament has backed gay marriage, ""Les Miserables"" has taken the movie world by storm, McDonald's is launching the ""McCamembert"" Burger and David Beckham has jetted in to join the French Revolution at Paris Saint-Germain. Vive le France? Not so for those earning more than $1.3 million a year, especially after Socialist President Francois Hollande announced he would introduce a top income tax rate of 75%. It has become a real point of contention, with some -- including top sports stars -- threatening to move abroad. Depardieu ditches France for Putin's Russia . Renowned actor Gerard Depardieu has already taken up the offer of Russian citizenship, despite France's constitutional court vetoing Hollande's proposal. But while the plans over taxation are on hold, those involved with the nation's football are worried that their star assets are heading to the United Kingdom and abroad to seek sanctuary. ""What you see is that French football loses good players, all leaving for England, so the Premier League will be above all the other leagues,"" Marseille manager Elie Baup told reporters. ""In France, because of the financial side, we will have to work on young players or with recruits not well known, and then we'll make them big, and they'll go to England again. We are entering this 'cycle.' "" During the January transfer window, international striker Loic Remy left French title contender Marseille to move to Queens Park Rangers, a club which was bottom of the English Premier League and threatened with relegation. Football's middle men eye rich pickings in transfer window . Even more remarkably in January, no less than five Frenchman made the switch to Newcastle, a move which led to the hanging of the ""Tricolor"" in the EPL club's canteen. Lille's Mathieu Debuchy, Montpellier's Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, Massadio Haidara from Nancy, Toulouse's Moussa Sissoko and Bordeaux's Yoann Gouffran all made the move to the north east of England. They should feel at home as there's already more than a hint of Gallic flair at St. James' Park, with the wonderfully talented pair of Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa at the club, as well as the likes of Sylvain Marveaux, Gabriel Obertan and Romain Amalfitano. ""I'm not surprised that they want to play there because it's the best league, but I am surprised by just how many French players have gone there at the same time,"" former Newcastle and France player Didier Domi told CNN. However, Domi insisted that financial motivation was not the reason for this footballing exodus to Newcastle. ""Tax is not a big factor. The biggest draw is the chance to play in front of packed stadia every week,"" he said. ""It's the place where all players want to play. When the French players come back to France after a spell in England, they all talk about how great it is. ""It's professional, it has great fans and atmosphere and it's where all the best players are. I loved it at Newcastle. The fans and people of the north east are so friendly and full of warmth."" Mickelson has a point on taxes . In the last French election, held in May 2012 -- the French population in London was given the opportunity to vote on the establishment of a parliamentary member for Northern Europe. There are 120,000 officially registered as living in the British capital, but one of those -- politician Axelle Lemaire -- believes the total is nearer 400,000. Before winning that parliamentary ballot, as a representative of Hollande's Socialist Party, Lemaire lived and worked in London for 12 years. ""Many people come and go between the two countries thanks to the new transport links and there are a lot of younger people who come to London and move on afterwards,"" she told CNN. ""I arrived in London 12 years ago and I remember reading the headlines in the newspapers then about how French people were moving for tax reasons. ""But the reality is very different. Even now there is a lot being written about people leaving because of the 75% tax reasons. I've not seen any serious figures supporting this. The reality is very different. ""People come here for a whole variety of reasons: to study, to work, to learn English, for love, for the international dimension of the UK. ""Taxes, at the end, are pretty similar in the two countries, and constitute very rarely a reason to move out. ""It has become more and more normal to spend some time in your career or to study abroad. ""Some stay and some leave after a while. Sometimes, bi-national couples move to France if they have a second child because the cost of living is expensive here."" Why Depardieu's 'pathetic' desertion has caused French storm . Lemaire also doubts that recent raft of French arrivals at Newcastle has anything to do with the levels of tax in their own country. ""I think it's a misconception to say they're here because of taxes,"" she said. ""These players are young and earning their first big contract in a very good club and that's a great opportunity for them. ""'I don't think they've thought to themselves, 'I want to leave for tax reasons.' "" Dubbed ""Neufchateau"" by the French media, Newcastle is in many ways no different from many other Premier League clubs in luring talent from across the Channel. The likes of Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Nicolas Anelka, Emmanuel Petit, Marcel Desailly and Claude Makelele are just some of those to enjoy huge success in England. While the typical English football fan might refer to the French as ""Frogs"" and take pleasure in mentioning the military victories at Waterloo and Agincourt, the acceptance of French talent on the football field has never been in doubt. One Frenchman who made the move to England and then to Newcastle was football writer Kevin Quignane, who believes the most difficult task facing his fellow countrymen is understanding the locals' notorious ""Geordie"" accent. ""There was indeed a bit of a linguistic shock,"" Quignane recalled following his arrival in the city. ""I'd say that a true, thick Geordie accent is more difficult to understand than a broad Yorkshire brogue, which in itself can be pretty challenging. ""I just couldn't understand our next door neighbor and my partner, who is herself a Geordie, also had great trouble. ""It really can be challenging but by and large, most locals speak with a mild Geordie accent, thank God. That or I've got so used to it that I don't notice anymore."" While it might take time for the newcomers to adapt to the local lingo and swap their Chardonnay for a pint of Newcastle Brown Ale, Quignane believes the recent arrivals will enjoy life in the city. ""Newcastle's stock as a city has risen tremendously in the last decade,"" he added. ""It's now seen as a vibrant, party-going and sexy place, but it was a very different story 10 years earlier with the demise of the mines and shipyards and the Meadow Well riots in 1991. ""The Quayside, now Newcastle's nightlife epicenter -- revamped and regenerated -- was a mess back then."" Beckham to donate PSG wages to children's charity . Back in France the arrival of a world superstar in Beckham at Paris Saint-Germain has helped softened the blow of so many departing French players. The midfielder signed a five-month deal with PSG last month and has pledged to donate his salary to a children's charity within the city. And while worries persist over the numbers of young French players moving aboard, Beckham arrives at a time where big-name foreign players are playing a starring role in Ligue 1. Backed by its Qatari-based owners, PSG recently paid out $52.8 million for young Brazilian Lucas Moura after securing a $72 million deal for Zlatan Ibrahimovic and defender Thiago Silva from Milan last July. The club has qualified for the quarterfinals of the Champions League and leads the domestic title race. ""I am very glad,"" Lemaire said of Beckham's arrival in the French capital. ""I think that it's great that he decided to move to Paris and to donate his wages to charity. It's a very good example. ""It also shows that Paris is a good club and an attractive city.""","English club Newcastle has welcomed an influx of French footballers to Premier League .

"(CNN) -- The furor over Jerry Sandusky has died down some now that the former Penn State football coach has been convicted of serial child sexual abuse. But for Gerry Sandusky, a sportscaster for the Baltimore Ravens, the backlash continues. Not that Gerry Sandusky has done anything wrong. His only offense is that he shares the same name with the man who preyed on young boys and who was convicted on 45 counts related to child sex abuse. Take a look at recent postings on Gerry Sandusky's Twitter page. A woman named Jessica wrote ""@GerrySandusky you're a disgusting vile human."" Sandusky responded: ""Wrong guy. I'm Gerry with a G. Baltimore sportscaster. No relation to the former Penn St coach who spells his name with a J."" Another person tweeted: ""hope you get knifed in prison."" Another asked: ""@GerrySandusky I'm just confused...why would you do such things to children? #mean"" Sandusky said he received thousands of these messages. And he is trying to stay patient. ""The general consensus is people inviting me to an extended stay in hell, or a miserable death or prison rape,"" Sandusky said. ""I received a lot of F-bombs. I can understand the confusion. It is an emotional, heinous crime. I can understand the reactions. You just have to keep a sense of humor with this."" Sandusky said he knew he would be in for a tough time back in November when the Jerry Sandusky scandal first broke. The sports announcer said he was riding in the team bus as the Ravens were on their way to play the Pittsburgh Steelers. Everybody on the team bus was chatting and many were shooting stares at him. Sandusky went to see what all the commotion was about and then quickly realized he would be forever tied to one the most salacious sports scandals of all time. ""I thought to myself this was not going to go away for awhile,"" Sandusky said. The attacks and negative messages started right after the news broke, they intensified during the trial and got even worse after the verdict. Sandusky changed his biography on his Twitter page to say ""I am Gerry with a G. Baltimore sportscaster. No relation to the former Penn State coach."" But that did not stop the attacks. Christian H. from Connecticut was one of the many who sent Sandusky a nasty tweet. ""At first glance I thought it was him. In my mind Sandusky is a sick animal and shouldn't be here,"" said the 21-year-old who did not want his last name used because he feels bad about what he wrote on Twitter. ""I definitely feel for the guy. I respect his work in sports, but he needs to change his name because people are going to keep messing with him."" Sandusky said he is not going to change his name, and he refuses to let the other infamous Sandusky hijack the brand he has built working in sports for more than 30 years. In fact, Sandusky said he interviewed the other Jerry Sandusky early in his career in 1987 when he worked at a Miami television station. He went to the Fiesta Bowl when the Miami Hurricanes played Penn State and interviewed Jerry Sandusky for about 10 minutes. ""He seemed normal like any other football coach,"" said Sandusky. ""I did a little novelty story about our names being the same. Little did I know that 30 years later that name thing would cause so much trouble for me.""","Gerry Sandusky, a sports broadcaster, has been mistaken as Jerry Sandusky .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Robert Samija can't forget the date: April 16, 1993. As fighting raged between Croatians and Muslims in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, he saw the execution of a Muslim police chief -- the father of a classmate. ""I saw him get on his knees, begging for his life, and they shot him point blank,"" he said. ""Some people were cheering. But it was horrible."" Now, another date will burn bright in Samija's mind: May 26, 2011, the day Serbian army commander Ratko Mladic was arrested after eluding capture for more than 15 years. Mladic, the highest-ranking war crimes suspect who was still at large from the Balkan wars of the 1990s, is wanted on charges including genocide, extermination and murder by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. For the Bosnian victims of that war, Mladic's arrest provided some sense of closure, just as many of the loved ones of those who perished in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks sighed in relief at the news of Osama bin Laden's death. But the television repeats of images of Mladic and of events that took place during the war could also act as a trigger and make people relive their trauma, said psychologist Steven Bruce, director of the Center for Trauma Recovery at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, which has a large Bosnian refugee community. ""It's a double-edged sword,"" Bruce said. ""But in the long term, it's good news. I do think it does relieve some anxieties that he would never be found."" Samija, 32, who fled the war with his family to restart life in Atlanta, was elated by the news of Mladic's arrest. ""Until we clear our history, we cannot move,"" he said. In another part of Atlanta, Nazifa Garib was hard at work at her bakery, churning out dough for tandoori naan. She had gone to work before sunrise and had not heard the news. ""Oh, my God,"" she said, pausing for a few seconds. ""I have chills right now. This is very good news."" Before the Gulf War, Garib worked in Baghdad but returned to her native Bosnia in the early 1990s. She was reluctant to speak of the brutality she witnessed, of the family she lost. She said she felt relief that Mladic, whom she blamed for much of what she had suffered, was finally caught. She hopes he will be hanged like Saddam Hussein, but in public, where his victims can watch. Sanja Starcevic, whose family runs Neretva, a Bosnian eatery in suburban Atlanta, said the conflict was indescribable. Like the victims of the tornado this week in Missouri who were at a loss for words, the 55-year-old Starcevic said it was impossible to speak about what she had seen, especially in English, a second language. ""You have to be there and see how it is,"" she said. She was glad Mladic will finally face justice but said things will never be the same in Bosnia. ""You can't bring back all the people they killed, from all sides,"" she said. Edin Prozorac, 33, a Bosnian Muslim from Kennesaw, Georgia, sipped coffee outside Nerevta and described a life of ""slave labor"" under Serbian rule during his teen years, performing dirty jobs like cleaning streets, loading trucks, cutting trees and digging channels at the whim of the ruling forces. One haunting memory typifies the humiliation: A Serbian soldier made him repeatedly get up on and jump down from a trailer and put a gun to his head. ""It was hell,"" he said, ""Seven days a week."" Another Bosnian Muslim -- Senad Cajic, 49, of Kennesaw, Georgia -- said he lived about 45 days under Serbian rule before he escaped to a Bosnian-controlled region. He remembers stiff curfews and the killing of one man who broke them. Also, he recalls the scarce availability of food. ""We were really scared,"" he said. Eventually, he joined the Bosnian military -- more of a militia than an army -- thwarted persistent Serbian assaults and found a safe place for his family in Bosnian territory. Cajic said many Bosnians returned home after the warfare, but he couldn't go back to his house because it burned. Eventually, he and his family made their way to the United States. As for Mladic, Cajic said, the arrest was ""too late."" Unlike his countrymen who fought, fled for their lives, nursed war injuries and died, Mladic ""enjoyed his life for 15 years."" Mladic's arrest cannot erase the mistrust embedded deeply in Bosnian hearts, said Hamdija Custovic, who was only 12 when he witnessed war's horrors. The men in his hometown of Gacko were rounded up to be taken to concentration camps. His father escaped to the mountains, where he hid for four months. Custovic, 31, used to have Serb friends in school, but he was segregated from them before the war started. Later, they brought guns and knives to school, intending to turn them on their former buddies. Now, the Charlotte, North Carolina, resident sometimes hears from those former classmates on Facebook. But he can't bring himself to accept their offer to be friends. He doesn't trust them. Reconciliation was one of the themes sounded by Serbian President Boris Tadic as he announced Mladic's arrest. But Custovic, the spokesman for the Congress of North American Bosniaks, was skeptical. ""I think it is one of the steps,"" he said. ""But we have to keep in mind that this cannot end here. Just because they arrested (former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan) Karadzic and Mladic, it does not absolve Serbs of responsibility for the campaign that was led by thousands of soldiers."" The Germans, said Custovic, accepted responsibility for the Holocaust. There are many Serbs, he said, who will still deny that ethnic cleansing took place in Bosnia. The 1992-95 Bosnian war was the longest of the conflicts that erupted after the disintegration of communist Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the government of Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a bloody campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations. Mladic stands accused of leading the two-year siege of the city of Sarajevo that killed thousands and later, the systematic extermination of about 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica, now remembered as the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II. Muhamed Mehmedovic's father and brother were killed by Mladic's soldiers. Their bodies were found in mass graves. He traveled for seven days and nights with his mother and surviving brother to escape Srebrenica's atrocities, and he, like Custovic, made a new life in Charlotte. He has waited many years for the perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre to come to justice. ""They need to get every one of them,"" he said. Mladic's arrest was huge for Mehmedovic, 32. The entire world was watching the arrest of the man who destroyed his family. Rusmin Lilic, 40, a Bosnian Muslim from Stone Mountain, Georgia, lived through the worst of days in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital besieged by Serbian forces. A member of Bosnia's fledgling armed forces, he was wounded twice and said ""you had to defend your home. If not, you'd probably be killed."" He recalls two particularly horrid events in Sarajevo: snipers killing a group of kids on a cherry tree and a market bombing that killed about 70 people. The violence hardened him, and he mourned deeply when his good friend in the army died, but as more deaths piled up, he stopped crying. The violence and the incremental ""psychological killing"" ground down a dispirited populace. ""No food, no water, no shampoo, limited everything,"" he said. ""It's the worst thing for everybody."" ""I don't think the people will ever forget. I'll not forget that war."" Sitting outside the Neretva coffee shop and grocery store during his lunch break, Lilic sported national pride on his T-shirt, which commemorates a soccer game last decade between a Sarajevan and a Turkish team. ""I never gave up on my country,"" said Lilic. Lilic has paid visits to Bosnia since he moved away but said he'd be an ""enemy"" to his children if he chose to take his family back to live in the homeland. Perhaps, he said, he'll go back ""to be buried."" Prozorac said he's debating whether to discuss the past with his American children. He has never returned home. For Prozorac and many other Bosnians, the scars will never go away.","Ratko Mladic's arrest is good news for war victims .

"Washington (CNN) -- Energy Secretary Steven Chu will resign from President Barack Obama's Cabinet in coming weeks, he told Energy Department staff in a letter on Friday. Chu, who turns 65 this month, was a leading advocate in the Obama administration for alternative energy development, making him a target of the fossil fuel industry and its conservative supporters in Congress. He was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1997 and headed the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and taught at the University of California before becoming energy secretary in 2009. Read his letter . ""I informed the president of my decision a few days after the election that Jean and I were eager to return to California,"" Chu said in the letter. ""I would like to return to an academic life of teaching and research, but will still work to advance the missions that we have been working on together for the last four years."" He said he would stay on through an upcoming government energy research summit at the end of February, adding: ""I may stay beyond that time so that I can leave the department in the hands of the new secretary."" A statement by Obama thanked Chu for his ""dedicated service,"" saying he ""brought to the Energy Department a unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy."" Chu ""helped my administration move America towards real energy independence,"" Obama's statement said, citing a doubling in renewable energy use, reductions in dependence on foreign oil and progress toward creating green energy jobs. At a White House event later Friday honoring Medal of Science winners, Obama mentioned Chu's planned departure, calling it ""a loss for us."" He also praised Chu for ""designing a cap to plug a hole in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico when nobody else could figure it out,"" referring to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. Critics blamed Chu for government backing of failed clean energy ventures led by the collapse of Solyndra. The solar panel maker went bankrupt in 2011 after receiving more than $500 million in federal financing under an Obama administration effort to accelerate such investments. Who's who in Obama's cabinet . ""The direction the Department of Energy has taken under his leadership has been disconcerting,"" said Rep. Darrel Issa, R-California, adding that he considered ""taxpayer losses on projects like Solyndra and the department's deeply misguided effort to use taxpayer dollars as an investment bank for unproven technologies to be the most problematic aspects of his legacy."" In his letter to Energy Department staff, Chu called his stint as energy secretary the ""greatest privilege"" of his life. He cited the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, a government effort to support energy technology development, as a major accomplishment, along with steps that he said have doubled production of wind and solar energy. Chu's letter also defended the loan program linked to Solyndra, noting it was started in the Bush administration and supported 33 projects that he said generated $55 billion in economic investment. ""While critics try hard to discredit the program, the truth is that only 1% of the companies we funded went bankrupt,"" Chu wrote, later adding that ""the test for America's policy makers will be whether they are willing to accept a few failures in exchange for many successes."" Chu also called in the letter for stronger U.S. action on climate change in the face of unrelenting opposition by the fossil fuel industry and conservatives in Congress. ""While we cannot accurately predict the course of climate change in the coming decades, the risks we run if we don't change our course are enormous,"" Chu's letter said. ""Prudent risk management does not equate uncertainty with inaction."" In particular, he wrote that despite the improved ability to find and develop fossil fuel resources, the nation should work harder to develop viable alternatives. ""As the saying goes, the Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones; we transitioned to better solutions,"" Chu wrote. CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jessica Yellin and CNN's Kevin Bohn and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama lauds Chu for plugging the Gulf oil leak .

"(CNN) -- After the blood letting and recriminations in the wake of Lance Armstrong's doping confession, cycling continues to face questions over whether the sport is riding clean. The fall out from Armstrong's public confession sent shock waves through the sport and current Tour de France leader Chris Froome has voiced his frustration at continued questions about doping. So much so that Team Sky gave French newspaper L'Equipe data of 18 of Froome's climbs since he made his major breakthrough in 2011, leaving the French newspaper's sports science expert, Fred Grappe, satisfied the results were consistent with doping-free riding. Froome's teammate and reigning Tour de France champion, four-time Olympic gold medalist and Knight of the British realm Bradley Wiggins insists the sport is on the path to a bright future. Transparency . The 33-year-old's place in cycling's elite circle was cemented by his success in the sport's showcase event 12 months ago, the first time a Briton has claimed the coveted crown. And though injury has robbed him of the chance to defend his title in 2013, Wiggins thinks the sport is in rude health now the furore surrounding its shamed American star has begun to subside. ""The thing with the whole Lance story is his confession wasn't the tip of the iceberg where now all these other problems of the sport have now arisen,"" Wiggins told CNN's Changing Gears series, speaking ahead of the Tour de France. ""His problem was the final chapter of how the sport was 10, 15 years ago. That can now be put to bed and we can focus now on what's great about the sport now and the athletes we have. ""I think that's a great starting point for the future of the sport."" Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after admitting to persistent use of banned substances during his halcyon days at the sport's lofty peak. Wiggins denies the supremacy of Team Sky in last year's race -- that hinted they could dominate for years to come -- could propel other teams and riders towards the illicit substances that robbed Armstrong of his legacy. ""I don't think they're thinking that,"" he said. ""I think we're the role model, the template of how things are being done now. There's no secret of how we're doing it. We're very transparent, very clear. ""There's been a lot of riders at this team that have left for other teams that know how it works here, so slowly that will get around and I don't think people (will) revert back to that. ""I think the sport is in such a strong position with the anti-doping, the biological passports, that it's becoming harder and harder for people to go back to the old ways. ""I think one of the things that stood out for me, with the whole Lance Armstrong thing, was that he even said 10, 15 years ago there was no out of competition testing. ""It's a daily thing with the whereabouts system, giving your whereabouts seven days of the week. It's a completely different sport now and I think we're leading the way as a sport for other sports to follow. ""No matter what you're doing, you'll always get people that are cynical and are doubters. ""But by continuing to do what we're doing by answering these questions and putting ourselves out there to be shot at in time, it might take 15 years, I think we will gain credibility."" Unfolding drama . A measure of the strength in depth in the sport is evident even within Wiggins' own Team Sky ranks. Even if the 33-year-old had been fit enough to take part in this year's Tour, he would have been playing a supporting role to teammate and fellow countryman Froome, who finished second behind Wiggins in the 2012 Tour, but has dominated this year's race. Wiggins has since stated he might not take part in Le Tour again, citing the sacrifices required as too demanding for him and his young family. But even if he doesn't grace the roads of France again, Wiggins remains in no doubt as to the competition's pedigree. ""I think for a professional cyclist it's the height of your sport,"" he explained. ""I'm sat here now as the current winner of the Tour de France, sports personality in the UK, Sir Bradley Wiggins, and I've got that because I won the Tour de France. ""People are in love with this sport and they're in love with it because of the drama that unfolds each day -- the grit and determination people have to go through to win and I think that's what inspires people. ""It's had a tainted history but I think all that is a reminder of where the sport was and where it is now. And it's in a great position."" While its place in the pantheon of sporting theater is assured, Wiggins can attest to its attrition. For its legions of fans, watching elite athletes push the limits of endurance day after day is as captivating a sight as there is, but that doesn't mean it is always fun to participate in. ""It's one thing racing the tour and being part of it and getting to Paris,"" Wiggins said. ""It's another thing being up there, even wearing the jersey and being on telly every day and interviewed every day. ""At the time it's stressful, it's maybe not enjoyable all the time. But when you look back, when you look at it, you think 'that was some experience really' so it's an incredible thing.","Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins says cycling has a bright future .

"Berlin (Financial Times) -- The Greek parliament has approved controversial reforms of the civil service and tax administration, opening the way for mass dismissals of state employees in return for a €6.8bn aid disbursement by international lenders. The legislation was passed in the early hours of Thursday after the governing coalition secured a narrow majority in 15 separate votes on key clauses in the bill. The centre-right New Democracy party and Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) together control 155 seats out of 300, but won support from independents in several of the votes. One Pasok legislator broke ranks, voting against the axing of the 3,500-strong municipal police force. Protesters gathered outside parliament as voting took place, shouting anti-austerity slogans and calling for the government to resign. Earlier, legislators from Syriza, the main leftwing opposition party, which has pledged to boost state employment if it comes to power, joined the demonstrators in a show of solidarity. Among the protesters were teachers at vocational training institutes, school guards and municipal police officers who will be transferred to a special ""mobility reserve"" on reduced pay and given eight months to find another job in the public sector or face dismissal. The governing coalition is committed to sacking 15,000 civil servants by the end of 2014 under the bailout terms. The legislation was passed hours before Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, was due in Athens on a one-day visit to show confidence and urge the government to stay the course on structural reform. The vote came after the governing coalition made last-minute changes to the 108-clause bill to prevent defections by dissident lawmakers. Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, agreed to suspend payment of €80m in compensation for 2,600 workers who were sacked at the state broadcaster ERT last month, following complaints by a rightwing faction in New Democracy. ""We can't accept this level of payouts when we have cut the pensions of farmers [who receive the lowest state pension],"" said Makis Voridis, a rightwing legislator. Earlier, Antonis Samaras, prime minister, announced the EU and International Monetary Fund had agreed to a temporary cut in value added tax on restaurants, cafés and bars from 23 per cent to 13 per cent from August 1 in response to a longstanding Greek request aimed at boosting the tourist industry. The cuts would become permanent if, as the finance ministry argues, VAT revenues show a marked improvement. ""Our problems certainly haven't been resolved but . . . for the first time we've achieved some positive changes,"" Mr Samaras said. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","State employees face massive dismissal in wake of Greece's reform on civil service .

"(CNN) -- She is small but only in physical stature. Aung San Suu Kyi is the very embodiment of Myanmar's long struggle for democracy. The 66-year-old human rights icon defied Myanmar's authoritarian military junta with her quiet demeanor and grace when she spent 15 of 21 years under house arrest for her unending opposition to authoritarian rule in Myanmar. By the time she was freed in November 2010, she had become, perhaps, the world's most recognizable political prisoner. She was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights. Over the past year, Suu Kyi has met repeatedly with Myanmar's President Thein Sein and the country's minister for labor and for social welfare, relief and resettlement, Aung Kyi. Now, she will participate in Myanmar's next elections, Nyan Win, the spokesman for her National League for Democracy, said Friday. Her National League for Democracy announced earlier Friday that it planned to re-register as a political party and participate in all future parliamentary elections. During her captivity, she lived quietly by herself at her disintegrating Inya Lake villa in Yangon (the former capital, also known as Rangoon), accompanied solely by two maids. She had little outside human contact except for visits from her doctor. Sometimes, though, she was able to speak over the wall of her compound to her supporters, never once tiring of her crusade to break down the tyranny of dictatorship in her beloved homeland of Burma, the alternate name for Myanmar. Known as the ""lady"" in Myanmar, Suu Kyi has been compared to former South African President Nelson Mandela, who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid. In an interview with CNN several years ago, Suu Kyi, in fact, likened Myanmar's plight to South Africa's former brutal race-based system. ""It's a form of apartheid,"" she said. ""In Africa, it was apartheid based on color. Here, it is apartheid based on ideas. It is as though those who want democracy are somehow of an alien inferior breed and this is not so."" The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi spent much of her early life abroad, going to school in India and at Oxford University in England. She never sought political office. Rather, leadership was bestowed upon her when she returned home in 1988 after her mother suffered a stroke. Journey into politics . During her visit, a student uprising erupted and spotlighted her as a symbol of freedom. When Suu Kyi's mother died the next year, Suu Kyi vowed that just as her parents had served the people of Burma, so, too, would she. In her first public speech, she stood before a crowd of several hundred thousand people with her husband, Michael Aris, and her two sons and called for a democratic government. ""The present crisis is the concern of the entire nation,"" she said. ""I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all that was going on. This national crisis could, in fact, be called the second struggle for independence."" She won over the Burmese people. One of them was Nyo Ohn Myint, who participated in the 1988 protests as a college professor and now serves as one of the leaders in Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. ""She is more than her father's daughter,"" he told CNN. ""She has proven that she can bring together the Burmese people."" In 1989, the military regime threw her in jail. But even with Suu Kyi sitting behind bars, her party won the elections the following year by a landslide, gaining 82 percent of the seats in parliament. The regime ignored the results of the vote and Senior Gen. Than Shwe continued to impose numerous terms of house arrest on her. Suu Kyi, meanwhile, became the recipient of several human rights prizes and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Over the years, Suu Kyi repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in Myanmar. In one incident in 1998, soldiers prevented her from leaving Yangon. But Suu Kyi refused to turn back and was detained in her minivan for almost two weeks. The ordeal left her severely dehydrated, but was typical of her almost stubborn determination. Myint described her as energetic but humble. And a good listener. ""That's a skill I barely see in other people,"" Myint said. Gandhi's example . She has remained a devoted Buddhist who from the beginning admired the principles on non-violence and civil disobedience espoused by India's Mahatma Gandhi, Myint said. Over the years, Suu Kyi has made clear her devotion to bringing democracy to Myanmar. She has spoken of her separation from her loved ones as the sacrifice she chose to make for the freedom of her country. Her dying husband petitioned the Myanmar authorities to allow him to visit his wife. He had last seen her in 1995, but his request was rejected. Instead, the junta encouraged Suu Kyi to join her family abroad. But she said she knew that if she left, she would never be allowed to return. Aris died of prostate cancer in March 1999. Even before they were married, Suu Kyi had penned a letter to Aris professing her love of country. ""I only ask one thing,"" she wrote, ""that should my people need me, you would help me to do my duty by them."" Myint recalled calling her to express his condolences after Aris died in 1999. Suu Kyi was calm on the phone for the four-minute conversation but Myint could tell her heart was breaking. ""Maybe we are good at politics,"" Suu Kyi told Myint. ""But we are bad at family matters."" Life in captivity . Suu Kyi tried to break the monotony of her life by playing her piano, another passion in her life, according to the independent Irrawaddy magazine. But in time, the piano warped and Suu Kyi turned to painting to fill the void, the magazine reported. One day, maybe, people will see her canvases. Suu Kyi has also asked her lawyers to bring her books in English and French. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz had been allowed to present her with his book ""Globalization and Its Discontent."" In 2007, people defiantly took to the streets to protest rising fuel costs. The demonstrations were seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the government. The regime answered with a brutal crackdown. Suu Kyi's detention was extended again and again. She appeared gaunt -- and unhappy. Even when Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar in May 2008, Suu Kyi was not allowed to leave her house, though trees were crashing down all around her. The following year, Myanmar was again propelled into the headlines by a bizarre incident involving an American, John Yettaw, who improvised flippers to swim Inya Lake to Suu Kyi's compound. He said he had received a message from God to do so. Yettaw was arrested, and Suu Kyi was put on trial, charged with harboring Yettaw, and was punished with another 18 months of house arrest. Some believe that Suu Kyi's stubborn defiance has become an obstacle to progress in Myanmar. But her followers remain ardent in their admiration. She has clung to her dream of democracy, peace and freedom for Myanmar's 50 million impoverished people, they say. Those simple ideals have greatly complicated one woman's life.","Aung San Suu Kyi has been compared to Nelson Mandela .

"(CNN) -- One of the most infamous defendants in U.S. trials of recent years took two big steps Friday toward clearing her name, and she vowed to ""keep fighting."" Florida's 5th District Court of Appeal threw out two of Casey Anthony's four convictions of lying to authorities as they investigated the disappearance of Anthony's 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. The appeals judges agreed with Anthony's argument that the multiple convictions amounted to double jeopardy. But the judges upheld the other two convictions. In an internationally publicized and emotionally charged case, Anthony was tried in 2011 and acquitted of murder charges in the death of Caylee. The child was last seen June 16, 2008, but was not reported missing until July 15, 2008, when Casey Anthony's mother tracked her daughter down and demanded answers regarding Caylee's whereabouts. Investigators searched for the child for five months, eventually finding Caylee's skeletal remains in woods less than a mile from her grandparents' Orlando home. While she was acquitted in the death of her young daughter, Anthony was convicted of the four counts of lying to authorities. Those charges arose from statements Anthony made on July 16, 2008, to Orange County Detective Yuri Melich, who was investigating the disappearance of Caylee. According to Friday's court filing, the appeals judges rejected Anthony's claim that statements she made before being read her Miranda rights should not have been allowed in the trial. And they rejected her argument that the state statute she was convicted of violating is unconstitutionally vague. Anthony's lawyer, Cheney Mason, said when he called his client to share the ruling that two of the four convictions had been overturned, she said, ""We keep fighting."" Anthony could appeal the remaining two convictions to the Florida Supreme Court next. Read how Anthony's prosecutor has no regrets . When questioned early in the investigation, Casey Anthony admitted to police that she hadn't seen Caylee for more than 30 days, and on July 16, 2008, she was arrested on suspicion of child neglect, filing false official statements and obstructing a criminal investigation. At that time, she made the statements to Melich, which led to her convictions. After nearly three years of legal maneuvers, Anthony's capital murder trial began on May 24, 2011. Prosecutors alleged that she killed Caylee by using chloroform and covering her nose and mouth with duct tape, and that she put her body in the trunk of her car before dumping it in the woods. Defense attorney Jose Baez argued that Caylee drowned in the Anthony family pool on June 16, 2008, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George, covered up the death. Watch: A year after trial, where's Anthony? On July 5, 2011, a jury found Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child, while convicting her on the four ""false information"" counts. Anthony was sentenced to four years in jail, to be served consecutively. But with her time in jail as she awaited trial counting against the jail terms, she was released 10 days after her sentencing, on July 17. Even though she exited shortly after midnight, about 1,000 people jeered her as police guards and Baez escorted her to a waiting SUV and drove away quickly. Anthony still faces a defamation lawsuit from Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, of nearby Kissimmee, Florida. During Anthony's disputed July 16, 2008, statements to Melich, she said the last time she had seen her daughter was when she dropped Caylee off at Gonzalez's apartment. Gonzalez filed suit in September 2008, claiming that Anthony ruined her reputation. Last April, a judge ruled that the suit needed to go to trial by jury and denied Gonzalez's request for a summary judgment. In Session correspondent Jean Casarez reported for this story, and Mark Morgenstein wrote it in Atlanta.","An appeals court invalidates two of Casey Anthony's convictions, upholds two others .

"(CNN) -- For the third time, Mahmoud Al-Qassab lowers the body of one of his children into the ground. He steps back as neighbors and relatives shovel dirt over his teenage daughter's grave. He does not cry or wail. ""I thank God this is my third martyr: Ahmed, Abdullah and now her. I thank God, and I will not say anything against his fate,"" Mahmoud told an activist filming the small funeral. Just a few months ago, 18-year-old Ayat Al-Qassab sang and danced with her mother and aunts as they dressed the bride in her wedding gown. Now, her shattered and bloodied body lies in a grave below the crumbling, bullet-ridden buildings of Homs. Read more about Ayat's wedding . ""She was killed and she took my heart, my soul, my mind and everything with her, but we will not give up. We will not retreat. We must keep moving forward,"" husband-turned-widower Mohammad Jumbaz said quietly. Ayat did not lead battles or chair diplomatic talks. She is just like many other Syrians -- young, hopeful, and now dead. ""There was no daughter like her. She was bright and beautiful and playful. Then the siege happened and with it her destiny,"" Aisha Al-Qassab, Ayat's mother, said as tears streamed down her face. Ayat and Mohammad recently found out they were expecting their first child. The new family was elated, even as UNICEF estimates that 2.5 million people, including many children, are affected by the violence and instability in Syria. ""My love, she was only married a few months, then pregnant and now a martyr,"" Ayat's mother said. A 120 mm rocket fired into the family home struck Ayat in the head, killing her and her unborn child instantly. Ayat's father, who was standing nearby, was hit in the shoulder and wounded. ""The week before she died, a rocket attack injured her hand, and I had this feeling in my heart that it was a sign. It was as if God gave us just one more week to take her in and say goodbye,"" Mohammad said. Young, defiant and in love . Brave and defiant, Ayat hardly spoke of the frivolities of bridal gowns and wedding cake. ""I wore a white dress, but we did not have a traditional wedding because of this animal in power,"" Ayat said in an interview shortly after getting married. ""We hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding, because our happiness is the end of this government."" Although Ayat and Mohammad married just a week after meeting, the two were in love, her mother said. ""She was young, and I had not planned on her marrying, but the siege brought her destiny. A young hardworking man liked her and she saw him and he saw her and they fell in love and got married,"" Aisha said, shaking her head as if trying to forget. The newlyweds saw their marriage as a symbol of the resistance against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. For Mohammad, the part-time rebel fighter, revolution remained his shield, but the young man also believed living and loving was the greatest defiance of all. ""She was wonderful. We were newlyweds and we were happy. Even if she upset me I could not be mad at her. Her gentleness captured my heart and I pray that God opens the gates of heaven for her,"" he said, cracking a tiny smile as he remembered his wife. Guns and battles are far from Mohammad's true passion: baking sweet desserts. The young pastry chef loves making indulgent treats for Homs' fighters, families and children. ""When I give a family sweets, it is as if I am handing them a treasure,"" he said as he laughed loudly for the first time, thankful for the power of a single cookie in a city ravaged by war. Ayat shared Mohammad's delight for delivering glimpses of joy through pastries drizzled with sweet ""ater"" or syrup, even as gas, flour, sugar and milk were in short supply. ""She loved sweets, and more than that, she loved to watch me make them. We had even made date cookies and she died before she could eat them, so we gave them away,"" Mohammad said, still smiling. A childhood cut short . Ayat was born and raised in the Old District of Homs, Syria's third largest city. Her father was a laborer and her mother stayed at home with the kids, instilling in her the value of hard work and family. The third of five children, Ayat's two older brothers spoiled the brown-eyed girl while the two younger siblings depended on her care. ""She loved to study and she would always study. When the siege happened there were no schools left open,"" Ayat's mother said. More than 2,000 schools have been damaged or destroyed in civil war-related violence, and about 600 schools serve as makeshift shelters for internally displaced people, according to the Syrian government. ""She loved to help me with the housework, but I would not let her. I wanted her to study,"" Aisha said. The western city of Homs relies largely on industrial jobs. For Ayat's family, education provided an opportunity for their children to escape manual labor in a country where the average monthly salary is $300. ""She wanted to be an expert in Sharia law -- maybe she could have even got her Ph.D. if she got good grades, but God did not plan this for her,"" Aisha said. War and marriage . The Syrian uprising sparked by revolts across the Middle East forever changed Ayat's country and transformed Homs into a bastion of resistance against al-Assad's government. ""(Ayat) grew up on the love of God and when the demonstrations started she fell in love with the revolution and was very proud of her brothers who fought and died for freedom,"" Mahmoud said. Revolution morphed into a full-scale civil war, consuming every corner of the beautiful country in a bloody and relentless fight for power. Amid a stifling siege on Homs, where the Syrian Army regularly blocked food, medicine and supplies, Mohammad and Ayat got married. ""I am very happy here with my life. Here our life is better than a honeymoon outside our country. We are not like the people who fled. Here we have our pride and we are defending our nation. I would prefer my honeymoon to be here amid the bombs and shells than for me to abandon my nation,"" Ayat told CNN earlier this year. But as the bitter winter cold and intensifying government shelling added another dimension to the struggle for survival, Ayat began fearing for her life and the life of her unborn child. ""She began to get very scared, and every time she would hear a plane fly overhead she would become afraid,"" Mohammad recalled, ""but she never asked to leave Homs. The opposite -- she was proud to stay, and I thank God for her martyrdom."" In Islam, martyrdom is a high honor granted by God to those who die fighting for their religion, country or rights of their community. Muslims believe a martyr is destined for heaven, so loved ones must celebrate rather than mourn their death. ""God gave her parents the patience to overcome the death of her brothers, and God gave me the patience to overcome the death of my brother. God willing, he will grant us the patience to overcome Ayat's death, too,"" Mohammad said. After nearly two years of conflict, more than 40,000 people have lost their lives. Syria sees a steady stream of funerals for its so-called martyrs, where shrill cries of joy compete with wails of pain in haunting processions for the dead. As difficult as it seems to rejoice over the death of a loved, the Islamic principle of martyrdom is at its core about blind faith that those who died righteously reside in a better place in the afterlife. It is a conviction the family clings to when nothing else can explain the death of a young, pregnant woman only a few months into her marriage. ""We had prayed that she would live and they would have children,"" Aisha said. ""And that we would become a grandpa and grandma, but God remembered her and he took her,"" her husband interjected. ""I pray that he destines us to martyrdom, too,"" Aisha added. The family's near impenetrable faith prevents them from protesting Ayat's fate, but by accepting her death, the family must survive on memories of her life. ""I will remember everything about her. What more can I say? I will remember everything, everything,"" Mohammad murmured. And with that, the family members bowed their heads and fell silent.","18-year-old newlywed Ayat Al-Qassab was recently killed by rocket in Syria .

"(CNN) -- They met on Valentine's Day when they were in college and had been inseparable in the 12 years since -- until Saturday morning. Amy Ellis said her husband, Bardstown, Kentucky, Police Officer Jason Ellis, ""just wanted to do his job and to do it good and to do it right and to clean up the streets."" But he was shot to death around 2 a.m. Saturday when he stopped his car on his way home to clear debris from a freeway exit ramp. ""Officer Ellis never had a chance,"" Kentucky State Police Trooper Norman Chaffins told CNN. ""It was an obvious ambush,"" Chaffins added. ""He never used his service weapon. It was holstered."" The 33-year-old, seven-year police veteran was the victim of a trap, though it was not clear whether he was the intended target, police said Tuesday. Bardstown Police Chief Rick McCubbin promised to avenge his officer's death. ""It's an eye for an eye. You kill one of my guys, I'm not going to rest until I have you in cuffs or on the front side of a weapon. And I mean that,"" he said. 'Ambush' killings of lawmen part of increase in slain police . Chaffins said it was unclear whether Ellis was the intended target or if the shooter planned to kill a different officer or even a random citizen. But he said he believes the killing was premeditated. ""Someone planned this, and someone planned to shoot somebody at that spot, at that location, at that time,"" Chaffins said. The brazen crime has sent a ripple of fear across Nelson County, south of Louisville. ""It scares everybody in the community. It could happen to anyone,"" resident Martin Rogers told CNN affiliate WHAS. ""If he wasn't the intended victim, that means anyone could have been the victim."" Ellis' widow told reporters Tuesday that she has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and love she has seen in honor of her late husband. She credited prayer and her two sons -- ages 6 and 7 -- for her strength. ""Now I know I have to be strong for our kids,"" Amy Ellis told reporters.

"London (CNN) -- Female drivers in Formula One are few and far between, but one woman aiming to change this is Susie Wolff. The 29-year-old is a development driver for Williams F1, where she works with engineers in a simulator and on track tests. She is about to compete in her seventh DTM racing car season for Mercedes Benz. She tells CNN about her journey so far. Beginnings: I grew up in the west of Scotland. My dad had a motorbike dealership and my mother met my father when she went to buy her first bike. I have an older brother and we got little karts. That's how it all started. He spurred me on. It was never about him wanting to beat his little sister. He's a film director and he's just been commissioned to make a documentary on my job in Formula One. When I was 13, the engineer that ran me in karts took me to a Formula Three race at Donington Park. A very young Jenson Button ended up winning that day and that's when I said to myself 'Okay: This is what I want to do when I'm older.' I went to Edinburgh University to study international business but gave it up after two years to follow my dream. Big break: The Young Driver of The Year award is a very prestigious award in Great Britain and I was the first ever female to make the final six. That got me noticed by Mercedes Benz. I joined their German touring car (DTM) program as a factory driver. (Team founder) Frank Williams was always very interested in the fact that one of his board members (Wolff's husband, Toto Wolff) had a wife who raced. Two years ago he visited and was interested to see what I could do. I'd had opportunities to be in a Formula One car but only as a publicity stunt -- three laps, end of story. Now, they are giving me the chance to be a development driver -- not just a one year deal, a proper chance to show what I can do. See also: Where do the world's most entrepreneurial women live? Physicality: It's incredibly physical. I drive up to 280km/h. The hardest thing is the g-force on your body under braking and the high speed cornering. I do a lot of back and stomach exercises and for the braking I need to have quite strong legs as well. Some drivers are very aggressive. I'm a smooth driver. I have very little movement on the steering wheel, which is why I'm sometimes better at conserving my tires than my teammates. Drivers try to stay as slim as they can and that's where I have a massive advantage -- I'm 20 to 30 kg less than the guys. Blazing a trail: I don't race to prove how good women can be against men. I race because I love racing. Don't get me wrong, I see these little girls all dressed in pink with Susie t-shirts on, and that's fantastic. Many girls who are really interested in motorsport watch Formula One and see no females there, so maybe they don't understand what they could do. I appreciate that I can have a positive influence in some kind of way. But I feel I still have a lot more to achieve before I can turn around and say I did something special, as a female in a man's world. Bikinis: It's a very fine line: I'm representing a car manufacturer and all the sponsors so of course you have to make an effort to look nice at the racetrack. On the other hand, you have these promo girls walking around in tiny bikinis. I have a lot of respect for them, because I could never walk in a paddock of men in a bikini. Everyone does what they can and what they're good at. See also: new wave of activists challenge notions of beauty . Role models: My role models are my mother and grandmother. They never said to me, 'You're doing something unusual.' I don't think my mother's ever watched the start of any of my races -- she gets nervous because that's when big accidents can happen -- but she's very supportive. My grandmother was incredibly strong. When my grandfather was 39, he ended up paralyzed from the waist down in a diving accident. She cared for him until she died last year. They never had any outside help. She never complained. She was never negative. She devoted herself to him and I think she had an incredible strength. Hardest lesson: In 2005, I couldn't get enough sponsorship to do Formula Three. I broke my ankle, so I missed some races. I was trying to get a drive in with Renault and got dropped by them at the last minute. I phoned my dad and said 'I've been dropped -- what am I going to do now?' As I put down the phone, it rang and it was Mercedes Benz. One week later I had a contract. It was quite a journey to get to where I am today and that was a point when I thought it was all going to fall apart. Sometimes there's not a lot of people around who believe in you, but you must always be willing to strive for your goals and never give up, even when things get really tough. See also: 10 most powerful women in tech . Trust your instincts: What I've learned in life is, you must follow your gut feeling. If you wake up every morning and are motivated and ambitious to achieve your goals, that gives you the best feeling in life. That brings you a happiness you can't get from anything else. Relaxation: I like to just chill out with my husband and go for nice dinners. I'm not a great cook and I hate the thought of spending an hour in the kitchen to make dinner, then spend 10 minutes eating and then tidy it all up again. Game face: My family say when they see me on a race weekend, I'm a different person. I'm much harder. I'm more focused on what I'm doing. Away from the racetrack, I'm a normal wife.","Susie Wolff was hired as a development driver for Williams F1 in April .

"(CNN) -- Keith Richards ejects his TV, Ian Fleming creates James Bond, Castro takes on Cuba -- sometimes a hotel room is more than a place to sleep . The best hotel rooms don't just have history, they have stories. You get a soft bed, an oversized tub and a chance to see through the eyes of some of history's cultural protagonists. Also on CNNGo: Best city hotel rooms with a view . Keith Richards' TV toss: Andaz West Hollywood . You'd never know from the sleek, modern lines that this was formerly the Continental Hyatt House -- a.k.a Riot House -- so nicknamed for the hair-raising antics of out-of-control rockers. This is where Keith Richards threw a TV off his 11th-floor balcony in 1975, Jim Morrison hung from a window by his fingertips and Axl Rose tossed steaks to crowds of adoring fans gathered outside on Sunset Strip. One reason the hotel is unrecognizable since its refurb is that the balconies are gone, replaced by glassed-in den areas, lest a new generation of entertainers gets any rowdy ideas. But, touchingly, Hyatt, which still operates the property, has paid tribute to the hotel's hell-raising heritage in the hotel's RH (Riot House) restaurant, which still feeds a modern-day rocker or two. Andaz West Hollywood, 8401 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood; sunset-view rooms from US$350 . Oscar Wilde arrested: The Cadogan, London, England . It looks genteel enough for your maiden aunt, but The Cadogan, in the heart of London's Knightsbridge shopping district, was struck by scandal within a few years of opening in 1887. Oscar Wilde was arrested in room 118 on April 6, 1895 for a homosexual act, and subsequently sent to jail. And Edward VII's mistress, the actress Lillie Langtry, continued to sleep in her old bedroom long after her former home had become part of the hotel. These days, despite being surrounded by foreign brand names like Gucci, Tiffany, Armani and Valentino, The Cadogan feels like a little piece of England forever suspended in the 19th century.

Within barely a quarter-century of opening in 1930, this hotel had launched a revolution. Fidel Castro set up a cell in the depths of the building, which was the epitome of pre-revolutionary decadence in Cuba, and guests fled from the ballroom in their sequins and tuxedos in 1959 as news spread that his coup had triumphed. It was not the first notorious event the hotel had witnessed; in 1946 it was occupied by the heads of all the major U.S. mafia families, and it was here that Meyer Lansky is said to have authorized the execution of Bugsy Siegel. The gangsters were followed by the Duke of Windsor, Nelson Rockefeller, Ernest Hemingway and a slew of Hollywood stars lured by the gambling and the showgirls of the hotel's Cabaret Parisien. Frank Sinatra stayed with Ava Gardner in room 225, Fred Astaire preferred 228, Johnny ""Tarzan"" Weissmuller 232 and Tennessee Williams 570.

Ian Fleming spent nearly 20 winters at this ocean-side retreat, penning several James Bond thrillers. The hideaway played host to glitterati and literati, including Noël Coward (who rented GoldenEye for two months before buying his own home on the island), Errol Flynn, Lucian Freud, Katharine Hepburn, Evelyn Waugh, Cecil Beaton, John Gielgud and Princess Margaret. In 1956 British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden and his wife spent a month at GoldenEye after his health collapsed in the wake of the Suez Crisis. A dozen years after Fleming's death in August 1964, entertainment entrepreneur Chris Blackwell purchased the property, drawing a new slew of celebrities. Sting, Bono, Michael Caine, Quincy Jones, Johnny Depp and the Clintons have all planted trees at the resort following a tradition started by Eden.

Stephen King writes 'The Shining': Stanley Hotel, Colorado . Movie buffs scared by the opening credits of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" are likely to get seriously spooked stepping into the actual hotel that inspired Stephen King to write the book. Considered one of the United States' most haunted hotels, it was built by F. O. Stanley in 1909 on a mountainside in Estes Park, some 2,286 meters above sea level. Many ghostly children have reportedly been heard playing up and down the hall of the 4th floor -- just like those twins in the movie -- while the late Mrs. Stanley's shade favors the Music Room. Room 401 is said to have been haunted for 80 years by Lord Dunraven, but the spookiest room of all is room 217, where King himself stayed. Jim Carrey also stayed in 217 during the filming of ""Dumb & Dumber,"" but has declined to explain why he felt compelled to check out in the middle of the night. However, visitors will be relieved to know blood has never been seen seeping out of the elevators. So far.

This was the building Mozart called home in 1788, and it still has its original frescoes and vaulted chapel ceilings. Steps from the city's iconic Charles Bridge, the hotel's location can't be bettered -- the Old Town, Vltava River quay and winding cobblestone streets of the Mala Strana are all less than 10 minutes away on foot. Mozart dedicated six sonatas to the owner of the property in lieu of rent, but these days cash or credit card are preferred. If you want to sleep where the maestro did, ask for room 218.

For a small country inn -- dating back to 1135 -- The Olde Bell has seen an awful lot of intrigue. It was the scene of a plot to overthrow King James II during the 17th century by one Lord Lovelace of Hurley, and you can still see the door to a secret tunnel that ran between the inn's bar and Lovelace's mansion. Lovelace's ""Glorious Revolution"" drove James II into exile and placed his son-in-law William of Orange on the throne. Plot-hatching continued during World War II, when Winston Churchill met Eisenhower here. Because of its proximity to Pinewood, movie stars have been staying here for nearly a century while filming.

The British Army leased the top floor as an emergency HQ when the Arab revolt broke out in 1936, and a decade later was battling Israeli guerillas, who planted a bomb in the basement, causing 91 deaths. On May 14, 1948 the Union Flag was lowered, and with independence the hotel regained its place as the city's hotel of choice for visiting heads of state and celebrities. La Regence, site of the 1946 bombing, is one of Jerusalem's best restaurants, and the huge breakfast room, where hundreds of oranges are hand-squeezed on the spot every morning, is a triumph of art deco architectural splendor.

"London (CNN) -- Internet giants signed up Tuesday to a ""zero tolerance"" approach to images of child sexual abuse as the British government announced a new, tougher strategy to find and block illegal content. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook were among the firms summoned to a meeting on the issue at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, by the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The summit was called in the wake of two recent UK child murder cases. In each case, the killer had viewed child sexual abuse images and violent pornography on the Internet, sparking calls for action to eradicate such content and protect vulnerable young people. After the summit, the government said the Internet Watch Foundation -- a watchdog body set up in 1996 -- would have new powers to seek out child sex abuse images, block access to them and remove them. The watchdog has previously acted after an image of child sexual abuse was reported to it via a hotline. While there are an estimated 1 million unique images of child abuse online, only 40,000 reports are made to the Internet Watch Foundation each year, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said. Now, the watchdog will work with a cross-agency government body, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, known as CEOP, to hunt down such images, the department said. And the UK's leading Internet service providers -- Virgin Media, BSkyB, BT and TalkTalk -- have agreed to give Â£1 million ($1.57 million) over the next four years to help fund the new approach. Tuesday's agreement represents a ""fundamental change"" in the way child sexual abuse content will be tackled, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said. ""This will mean more images of child sexual abuse will be tracked down and acted on,"" said Culture Secretary Maria Miller. ""The abuse of children is absolutely abhorrent -- and that child is further violated every single time an image is circulated and viewed. The IWF and CEOP already do important and valuable work. ""This agreement will mean these organizations will no longer be limited to reacting to reports received. They will now have the remit and the resources to take the fight to the criminals perpetrating these vile acts."" In addition, Internet providers have agreed to introduce by the end of the month special pages to tell users when they try to access a page that has been blocked by the Internet Watch Foundation. The four main UK Internet service providers will also beef up the parental control options they offer, so that parents can easily restrict Internet access on all devices in their home by the end of the year. The main cell phone service providers in the United Kingdom also took part in the talks. All the firms present signed a statement saying: ""We have a zero tolerance approach to the presence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet."" Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking to reporters at the Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland, said he was ""personally committed"" to the battle. He said he welcomed steps to make sure the big Internet companies ""use their expertise, their brains and their brilliance to get these disgusting images off the Internet much faster."" Tuesday's summit is not the only action taken by Web giants to tackle the scourge of exploitative images online. Google said Tuesday that it will spend $5 million on an effort to wipe pictures of child sexual abuse from the Web and another $2 million to research more effective ways to find, report and eradicate the images. Some of that money will go to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as well as the Internet Watch Foundation, said Jacqueline Fuller, the director of Google Giving, in a blog post. The Web giant also is creating the Child Protection Technology Fund to develop more efficient ways to fight child porn, and already works to tag illegal images and prevent them being found elsewhere.","UK government summons Internet giants to talks on tackling child sexual exploitation online .

"New Orleans (CNN) -- New Orleans police arrested a second suspect in the Mother's Day shooting that wounded 19 people this week, including three still in critical condition, authorities said Thursday. The two suspects are believed to be involved in gangs, police said. No further details were immediately available, authorities said. Meanwhile, the first suspect, Akein Scott, 19, is facing 20 counts of attempted second-degree murder in the Sunday shooting, and his bail was set at $10 million during his first appearance in Orleans Parish Magistrate Court on Thursday morning, court records said. Scott's next hearing is scheduled for July 16. Among the three people still in critical condition from the shooting is a reporter, police said. A SWAT team was used during Scott's arrest Wednesday night in east New Orleans, CNN affiliate WDSU reported. Police identified Scott as a suspect Monday after footage of the shooting was released. Images of the parade, released by police Monday, show a man standing at the outskirts of a packed parade route. A moment later, he charges toward the crowd. The surveillance camera images show the panicked crowd scrambling for cover. The man runs away, leaving people and bicycles scattered on the ground behind him. A $10,000 reward was offered in the case. The shooting, during a festive Mother's Day parade, renewed concerns about crime in the city. It was the third holiday this year when guns have been fired into crowds, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. A January 21 shooting near a Martin Luther King Day parade left five wounded. Four people were hurt in a February Mardi Gras attack, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported.

"(CNN) -- Ariel Castro was indicted Friday on 329 counts for allegedly kidnapping and holding captive three young women in his Cleveland house for 10 years, authorities said. One charge accuses the 52-year-old Castro of aggravated murder for purposely causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy, authorities said. One of the young women was allegedly impregnated five times by Castro, and another bore a child fathered by him, police have said. The indictment charges Castro with 139 counts of rape, 177 counts of kidnapping, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, three counts of felonious assault and one count of possession of criminal tools, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said in a statement. Castro will be arraigned next week, authorities said. The charges cover only half of the 10 years the three young were held captive -- from August 2002, when the first of three women disappeared off a Cleveland street, to February 2007. The three women were freed last month after one shouted for help while Castro was gone from the house. The prosecutor's capital review committee will consider whether the case is appropriate for seeking the death penalty once the indictment process is complete, the prosecutor's statement said. ""Today's indictments represent a first major step in the criminal justice process,'' McGinty said in a statement. ""Our investigation continues, and we will present our findings to the grand jury.'' The indictment alleges that Castro taped the legs and mouth of one woman identified as Jane Doe 2 and also chained her to a pole in the basement with a motorcycle helmet placed on her head. Castro also allegedly used a vacuum cord around her neck during a felonious assault and chained her to inside of a van, the indictment said. Castro allegedly used chains and tape in the basement to restrain another woman identified as Jane Doe 3, the indictment said. The victims were earlier identified by police as Michelle Knight, abducted at age 21 in August 2002; Amanda Berry, abducted at age 16 in April 2003 and who has a 6-year-old daughter by Castro; and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, who was 14 when kidnapped in 2004. Jim Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, and Kathy Joseph, attorney for Michelle Knight, expressed satisfaction with the indictment. ""We have a great legal system, plus confidence and faith in the prosecutor's office and its decisions.

"Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- In the Virginia House of Delegates, Republican Robert Marshall is a longtime abortion opponent who has tried repeatedly to pass legislation in his state that would give rights to the unborn. This year, on his third try, Marshall just might get his wish, and that has advocates for women's reproductive rights concerned. The House of Delegates passed a so-called ""personhood"" bill Tuesday sponsored by Marshall that would give unborn children at all stages of development -- including embryos -- the same rights available to ""other persons"" in the state ""subject only to the laws and constitutions of Virginia and the United States, precedents of the United States Supreme Court, and provisions to the contrary in the statutes of the Commonwealth."" ""We need to get back to the respect for life that we used to have in this country that's been lost,"" Marshall told CNN. Virginia is the latest front in a long-running battle over women's reproductive rights -- a fight that has taken center stage in recent weeks after a controversial decision by the Obama administration to require religious groups to provide their employees access to birth control in their insurance plans at no cost. The administration later offered a compromise, after drawing fire from Catholic leaders and other religious organizations. However, the issue has stayed in the headlines. Marshall's bill must still be passed by the Virginia state Senate. If that happens, Republican Gov. Robert McDonnell's office has said he will review the measure if it reaches his desk, but he has not committed to signing it. Opponents of the legislation believe it could restrict access not only to abortions but to some forms of contraception, like those that prevent implantation of fertilized eggs. Democratic Delegate Eileen Filler-Corn, who supports abortion rights, said the legislation represented an ""overreach by the state."" ""These decisions should be left to a woman and her physician, a medical professional,"" Filler-Corn said. ""This is a slippery slope and eventually, the goal of the personhood movement is to ensure that birth control is illegal."" Marshall says his law does not directly challenge the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision affirming a woman's right to an abortion, although he acknowledged it is a step in that direction. He has dismissed what he calls the ""sky is falling"" claims of his critics, saying all his bill does is grant legal recognition to the unborn prior to birth. ""By itself, it does not outlaw abortion. It doesn't address birth control,"" he said. ""This is a side show designed to distract people's attention from what we're doing here."" A bill similar to Marshall's is pending in Oklahoma's state legislature. Voters in Colorado and Mississippi have rejected ""personhood"" ballot initiatives in recent years. Women's rights advocates say these legislative and ballot efforts around the country to establish fetal personhood are part of a move to place greater restrictions on women's access to abortion. ""Over the past several years, we've seen more and more attempts to restrict abortion directly,"" said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, an organization that describes itself as advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights through research and policy analysis. ""These efforts around redefining 'person' are a little more of a back door approach, because they don't use the term abortion. They're not an outright abortion ban. Instead they're using a less obvious approach in a way that does not exactly indicate exactly how far they go."" According to the Guttmacher Institute, new laws in 24 states in 2011 restricted access to abortion services, while according to the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America, the number of ""anti-choice"" measures being implemented in states has risen steadily over the past decade, from 303 in 2001 to 713 in 2011. NARAL cites measures that place limits on when and where a women can have an abortion, limit state aid or insurance coverage for the procedure, and mandate counseling. Whether the Virginia bill ultimately succeeds, politicians like Marshall are committed to keeping the issue front and center. ""I've been here for 20 years,"" he said. ""That means I don't quit."" His dedication is matched by those on the other side -- proof positive that 39 years after the Roe decision, the debate over women's reproductive rights is not going away any time soon.","A measure giving rights to the unborn passes the House of Delegates .

"(CNN) -- Powerful storms roared through the Mid-Atlantic states and portions of the Deep South, claiming the life of a child and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of households. At the peak of the outages, some 300,000 customers from Maryland to Georgia were without electricity, officials said. The National Weather Service said a tornado was spotted near Colesville, Maryland, in suburban Washington. In Richmond, Virginia, a 4-year-old boy died and his father was injured when a tree fell on them Thursday afternoon, CNN affiliate WTVR reported. The incident happened at Maymont, a 100-acre Victorian estate. ""The estate was being evacuated ... in preparation for the violent storm ... when the boy and an adult male with the boy were struck,"" said a post to Maymont's Facebook page. The estate will be closed until further notice. As nightfall approached, storms with straight-line winds moved into the South and threatened the Atlanta metro area. A tornado touched down near Canton, Georgia, a suburb northwest of Atlanta, around 7 p.m., the National Weather Service said in a preliminary report. The tornado, with estimated peak wind speed of 105 mph, left an 8.5-mile trail and had a damage rating of EF1, the second-least severe on a scale going to EF5, the service said. CNN affiliate WSB TV reported that damage from the tornado left hundreds of snapped trees and damaged a gas station's roof. WSB said winds as high as 70 mph swept through portions of Cobb County north of downtown Atlanta. It reported 900 lightning strikes in the area in a span of 10 minutes. Widespread power outages . Officials in Maryland and Virginia said more than 134,000 customers had lost power. In Georgia, the number topped 170,000. In Pennsylvania, the prestigious U.S. Open golf tournament resumed around noon after it was postponed because of severe weather moving into the area. And the weather situation appeared to be looking up for Philadelphia, near the site of the tournament. No severe weather is expected, and only light rain is in the forecast. Earlier Thursday, with the words, ""Turn around ... don't drown,"" the National Weather Service warned motorists in and around Lansing and Hastings, Michigan, not to drive through flooded streets. Streets in Lansing were flooded and closed Thursday because of high water, according to CNN affiliate WILX. The weather service warned that ""only a few inches of rapidly flowing water can quickly carry away your vehicle."" Residents of Fort Wayne, Indiana, received a similar warning. ""Flooding is occurring or is imminent,"" the service said. CNN affiliate WANE reported Thursday that severe storms damaged northeast Indiana and northwest Ohio. Damaging winds . A system of straight-line winds that slammed Chicago with 50-mph gusts and golf-ball-size hail Thursday bowled over trees and buildings in Auglaize, Ohio, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. The ""derecho,"" as the windy system is called, usually builds in the Midwest then heads east, he said. ""Derecho"" is a Spanish word that means straight. The system resembles a squall line, but instead of potentially producing tornadoes, it sends out a slicing wind. Derechos usually dissipate quickly, but, Cabrera said, this one held together pretty good.","4-year-old boy dies in Richmond, Virginia .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's recent economic downturn is spurring a new wave of worker strikes, which experts say are the only effective channel for them to air their grievances. Thousands of workers at the Yucheng Footwear Factory in Dongguan, a manufacturing hub in southern Guangdong province, clashed with police last week to demand better pay. Factory managers laid off 18 employees and cut overtime after a drop in overseas orders --prompting employees to demonstrate at the local government building. ""The slow-down strike is still on but there's no street protest because the police have been mobilized,"" said one worker, who asked to remain anonymous when interviewed by phone five days after the labor action. ""A dozen workers got injured during the clash and were sent to hospital."" China labor unrest flares as orders fall . The protest is one of many to hit manufacturers operating in southern Guangdong province -- the ""workshop of the world"" -- as increasingly frustrated workers vent their discontent at low pay and poor working conditions. ""This is probably the most intense spike in worker activism since the wave of strikes that hit Chinese manufacturers in summer 2010,"" said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group that monitors labor issues in China. In June, workers at the Toyota and Honda Motor plants in southern China went on strike, halting production and forcing pay hikes. Experts attribute the spike in protests to employers maximizing their shrinking profits at the expense of workers. ""There are a broad range of complaints but they are basically related to being squeezed by their employers who are themselves making less profit,"" said Crothall. ""Also many businesses in the Pearl River Delta are planning to relocate inland and this is creating uncertainty and anxiety among the workforce."" China's economy has become the world's second largest after three decades of rapid growth, and much of that growth has been driven by exports and large infrastructure projects. But lately, the economic engine has been running out of gas. China's mighty industrial engine is stalling . Home sales fell 25% last month and a report this week said manufacturing may be at a three-year low. The economy grew 9.1% last quarter from a year ago, the lowest since 2009, but inflation still hovered at 5.5% in October. Chinese officials have tried to boost the economy with wage increases. Several provinces and cities have increased wages this year. Shanghai raised its minimum wage by 17%, while Guangdong, China's export base, boosted theirs by an average of 21%. Some experts say the salary hikes will accelerate the country's industrial restructuring, saying higher labor costs will force enterprises to be more technologically advanced and transform China's export-oriented economic growth model to one that is boosted by domestic demand. But others worry the wage hikes may lead to massive layoffs in companies already facing increased factory payrolls and production costs, leading to labor unrest. The specter of large-scale labor unrest worries Chinese officials whose fear of ""luan"" (chaos) is close to visceral. ""Labor unrest is a glaring reminder to them that their attempts to reduce social injustice and income disparity are not working,"" opined Crothall. ""They are trying manage social and economic disputes in the usual administrative top-down manner without giving workers a voice in resolving their own grievances. That is why workers have no choice but to take to streets to make their voices heard."" China strictly bans independent unions. It worries that independent union members might challenge the government as the Solidarity movement did in Poland. The authorities are quick to suppress any labor group not under their direct control. Workers can only turn to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a government-sanctioned organization whose primary mission is to support Communist party policies and seek basic compensation for workers. With no means of collective bargaining, workers resort to petitioning the government -- or illegal protests. He Yuancheng, who works at the Laowei Law Firm, said workers typically go on strike due to lack of labor union or organizations that can genuinely represent their interests. ""The workers' main complaint is the lack of channel, a system, that can allow them to fight for their interests,"" he said. ""They can only resort to strikes to assert their rights and to counterbalance the power of the employer."" He, whose Guangdong-based law firm mainly handles labor rights cases, said the Chinese authorities would be better off allowing trade unions if they wish to avert luan and maintain social stability. ""To protect worker's rights is to protect stability,"" he added. ""Only when rights are protected can stability be realized.""","Thousands of workers in southern Guangdong province clashed with police last week to demand better pay .

"(CNN) -- Keith Felch is admittedly a big guy, but more than a few super-fit cyclists in Southern California have been left wondering how that dude just went flying by. Keith Felch calls his electric bike a ""hill eraser"" because he can ride it to work without breaking a sweat. And then his wife, Mary, comes motoring past. ""They stare, like how can a girl go past me,"" she says, laughing. It takes the other riders a few seconds but then they figure it out. They have electric motors. The Felches, who live in Aliso Viejo, California, used to drive everywhere, except when they used their bikes for recreation. That changed when they got their new e-bikes, made by a company called Optibike. Now, they ride to go shopping and to go to breakfast -- but mostly they ride to work. Keith Felch says the couple has cut 50 percent of their car-use since they started electric biking. And there are other benefits. Keith Felch dropped 30 pounds and his blood pressure fell 10 points in the first six months he owned the bike, he says. The Felches don't exactly classify themselves as ""environmentalists,"" although Mary said it is important to have a positive effect on the planet. ""I learned that the worst amount of smog that you put out [in an automobile] is in the first mile, so if we can make even some of those shorter trips on our bicycles, it makes a big difference,"" she says. Who wants one? Brent Meyers, director of sales for Ultra Motor US, says electric bikes attract different types of buyers. Many are looking to make a green imprint. Some are ""active adults"" who have ridden bicycles for years who -- as they get older -- are unable to do the same kind of riding they did when they were young. Other buyers want to ride their bikes to work quickly -- and avoid a sweaty entrance into the office. Oddly -- or perhaps not -- Ultra Motor US sees its strongest sales when the price of oil skyrockets, says Meyers. Two wheels, a motor and 100 million riders . Electric bikes are still somewhat of a novelty in the United States, but in China they're everywhere. In fact, Chinese electric bikes number more than 100 million -- which is about four times the number of Chinese private cars, according to Electric Bikes Worldwide Reports. The bikes are popular in Europe as well. Sales figures for the United States are hard to pinpoint. In the United States, about 200,000 electric bicycles were sold last year, said Ed Benjamin of the Light Electric Vehicle Association -- about twice the number sold in 2005. But the industry has hit a bump in the road from the recession, as sales were down about 10 percent in 2009, he said. E-bikes are mostly made by specialty companies, but the growing sales trend has been noticed by the big boys. Trek, a worldwide leader in bike sales, has been making electric bikes for three years, but only introduced them in the United States in the past year. Other well-known companies like Schwinn and Giant are increasing their presence in the e-bike field. At Interbike, the biggest bicycle industry convention in the United States, there were more than 20 companies displaying e-bikes this year. Meyers said only a few years ago, it was about five. Prices range from a few hundred dollars -- the E-Zip Trailz Hybrid costs $398 at Wal-Mart -- to more than $13,000 for OptiBike's top-end model. Prices increase as battery technology and components get better. Steve Roseman of The Electric Bike Network in San Francisco, California, said most buyers he sees don't balk at the price, which can be as much as a good road or mountain bike. They are mostly concerned with how far they can go on a battery charge and how fast. What's an 'e-bike'? By law, electric bikes must have no more than 1 horsepower and go no faster than 20 mph (on motor power alone). Basically they are much like traditional bicycles with small motors that power the bike or assist a rider with pedaling. Many have gears like a regular bike. ""It's just adding the throttle aspect, other than that it handles like a regular bicycle,"" Keith Felch said. He says he uses the throttle all the time, choosing one of two modes -- eco [half power] or fast [full power]. He says he once tried a regular bike for his 4 ½-mile ride to one of his music studios where he teaches jazz improvisation. But the hills nearly got him. He calls his electric bike a ""hill eraser."" It also makes the ride to his farthest studio -- 22 miles away -- seem much closer. He says he gets about 35 miles on his primary battery and has an additional one for long rides. Shifting views . But as they tout the virtues of electric bikes, advocates also realize that there will have to be a shift in the way Americans view them before they become as popular as they are in Europe or China. ""There are two possible sides to the equation,"" Roseman said. ""One would be a change in the way people view transportation. There are still a lot of SUVs out there. ... People still have a hard time thinking about riding a bicycle unless they are 10 years old, it seems. So there needs to be a little shift in mentality."" ""But having said that, I think there is a growing awareness about health and transportation and environmental issues so it could be that we are just reaching a juncture where things will change [for e-bikes]."" Meyers says people also have a preconceived notion about electric bikes. Some view them as expensive or poor quality or uncomfortable. And Meyers admits, e-bikes are not for everybody. As Roseman says, people who live in Spandex will probably always prefer a really good road bike and hard-core city cyclists may well stick to their fixed-gear bikes. Meyers says Ultra, which sells its bike for $2,700, isn't for those kinds of people. ""That's not our customer,"" he says. ""Our customer is someone who wants some form of electric transportation, green transportation, that can get them from Point A to Point B comfortably."" The Felches say taking a test drive will change a skeptic's attitude. ""If you ride one, it will blow your mind,"" Keith Felch says. ""When you get on one it's like being in a flying dream you've had. It's like everything you've dreamed your bicycle should do in your wildest dreams -- it's doing it.""","Electric bikes can run either on pedal-power or their tiny motors .

"(CNN) -- At every international airshow, there's a race to garner the most headlines, the most orders, the best visuals and the best sound bites. Usually, however, Europe's Airbus comes up the winner. This is particularly true at the Paris Airshow (which starts Monday and runs till Friday), where Airbus always makes a special push to win the headlines war. Airbus, of course, is headquartered in Toulouse, France, an hour's flight south of Paris. Government pressure . Aside from the aggressive competitiveness of Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy, who can't tolerate being second at any time and who rarely misses any opportunity to tweak Boeing, the French government is also known to pressure Airbus to make a great showing. Boeing conceded the point long ago. ""We know Airbus sees this as a competition on their home turf. In terms of orders, we see this as one week out of 52,"" admits Boeing's Vice President of Marketing Randy Tinseth, the company's most visible communications counterpart to Leahy. (Leahy's actual counterpart, Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Aircraft, tends to keep a low profile.) ""Despite the wave of orders our competition rolls out at airshows, the market has still been roughly split down the middle over the past decade,"" says Tinseth. How do you pick up a 'superjumbo' A380? High expectations . Leahy declined in a recent interview to predict how many orders he'll have to announce at the airshow, but skipped the Airbus Innovation Days international media briefings on June 5 and 6 -- an unusual absence -- to go globe-trotting for orders in time for the show. He's expected to announce hundreds. The A350 XWB -- the new, composite rival to the Boeing 787 and aging 777 -- is widely anticipated to make a flyover at this year's event. Some question the wisdom of even a flyby, as the A350 will have few test flights under its wing at that point. Airbus sends first A350 XWB into the sky . But the French government wants to showcase the plane and so does Airbus. Boeing strikes back . Boeing won't leave all its pizzazz at home. The formal program launch of its 787-10 is expected (although Boeing won't officially say so) and scores of orders are expected to accompany the announcement. Singapore Airlines has already said it will take 30 of the airplanes. British Airways is also presumed to be a launch customer. Boeing is also expected to announce several customers who have signed up for ""commitments"" for the 777X, although the program launch is considered likely for the Dubai Airshow slated for November 17-21. Emirates Airlines (headquartered in Dubai) is assumed to be a launch customer for as many as 100 of the new version of the venerable airplane. Thus, with two new airplane programs and hundreds of orders and commitments anticipated, Boeing could conceivably ""win"" this year's show. But video footage and pictures of the flyby of the A350 will be hard for Boeing to beat with artist renderings and sound bites. How will we travel 10 years from now? Other competitors . Embraer, which makes the popular E-Jet in the 70-122 seat market, is expected to formally launch its re-engined design of the E-175/190/195. (The 170 appears on its way out.) The upgraded E-Jet will feature new wings, new systems, geared turbo fan engines by Pratt & Whitney and room for an additional eight to 12 passengers. Embraer has been working diligently to line up solid orders to announce at the show. Bombardier, on the other hand, doesn't traditionally do well at airshows. Orders for its CSeries have been few and far between at these events, in part because Canadian securities laws require announcements within 24 hours of the signing of even letters of intent, making it virtually impossible for Bombardier to cluster announcements. The first flight of the CSeries will almost certainly miss the airshow, but is expected the next week. Bombardier will have to be content talking about tests leading up to the first flight, revealing an unidentified customer's identify (possibly Odyssey Airlines, based on an executive's slip of the tongue at an industry event) and perhaps some small order announcements. So, with all this activity, maneuvering and posturing, who will ""win"" the Paris Airshow? Airbus, of course. Scott Hamilton is an aviation writer and managing director of Leeham Co., which provides consulting services to the aerospace industry.","Airbus and Boeing both expected to make large order announcements at Paris Airshow .

"(CNN) -- Every morning Lorna Sculley wakes up unsure whether she will be able to feed her children. In her cupboard, nothing but tins of meat and beans. She questions whether her sons, who sleep on mattresses on the floor, will get the right nutrition. A 33-year-old single mother of three boys aged 12, eight and 17 months, Lorna says the constant fear that she cannot guarantee them food and shelter is ""heart-breaking."" She is one of more than a hundred thousand Britons fighting for food on a daily basis; using food banks and other charities to ward off hunger and homelessness in the UK-- Europe's third-largest economy-- as austerity bites. Yet from her kitchen window in east London she can see the big names of a multi-billion dollar financial powerhouse; HSBC, Barclays, Citigroup. And though her life and those of the financiers that populate the sterile walkways of Canary Wharf are only separated by the rail lines at Poplar station, for Lorna, they are worlds apart. ""If only I could have their lives for just one day,"" she tells CNN ""and not have to worry about where dinner will come from."" From April 2011 to April 2012, the Trussell Trust - a charity that works with local communities on food banks - provided emergency aid to 128,697 people in the UK; it predicts that number could almost double this year. Read more: Moody's downgrades United Kingdom from AAA . ""Sometimes it just feels like fighting a losing battle,"" Lorna says. ""If [the] food bank wasn't here I'd be on the street."" Living in the community of Tower Hamlets, one of London's poorest districts, Lorna is reliant on welfare benefits to put food on the table. Lorna says while she would like to work full time, she has three children to look after so depends on the state subsidies to supplement her low-paying, part-time job in the borough's school kitchens. But as in many European countries, austerity is top of the agenda for the UK government. It aims to rein in spending-- and that includes welfare benefits-- to tackle a high national debt and low economic growth. Read more: Britain risks new recession . In April, the government will implement a system that would replace the main means-tested benefits-- such as income and housing support -- with a single payment. The stated overall goal is to give people incentives to work. Critics say it means more people like Lorna may need to turn to food banks for help because there's a chance her benefits may be reduced under the new system. Read more: British pound takes pounding . But the government says the change is needed. John Stevenson, a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions told CNN the government already provides ""safety net"" essentials like food and housing through the benefits system. He added: ""Our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities; with the Universal Credit simplifying the complex myriad of benefits and making 3 million people better off."" The welfare reforms come at a time when many workers in Britain are feeling the squeeze of a global economic downturn and recession-hit Europe. Britain's workforce has taken the biggest pay cuts in the developed world according to a study published by the Trades Union Congress. It says real wages in the UK dropped by 4.5% between 2007 -- when the financial crisis exploded -- and 2011. Lorna is afraid that this combination of welfare changes, low pay and rising costs will make it difficult for her to survive as a working mother after April. She is a victim of the system, says Denise Bentley, who runs the Tower Hamlets food bank, and like many Britons, she is now struggling to cope with ""food and fuel poverty. ""She has done nothing wrong and that irks me,"" says Bentley. ""The cost of living has gone up but her wages have remained the same."" Lorna's story is not unique, as demand for food banks in the UK increases greatly. In the last 12 months, the Trussell Trust has set up 140 food depositories nationwide. The scheme relies on donations from individuals and private companies as well as volunteers to run the banks themselves. Chris Mould, executive chairman of the Trussell Trust, told CNN that the government's austerity measures meant people using food banks -- which are intended for emergency support -- needed help more often, placing strain on resources. Stagnating economic growth and a sovereign debt of 68% of the UK economic output at the end of 2012 is fuelling the government's austerity drive. But Mould believes the decisions of lawmakers in recent years have weighed too heavily on the country's poor. ""The budget is going to make things significantly worse for people who are already stretched,"" Mould says. Last year, the UK government ignored calls from the International Monetary Fund to relax its austerity program and allow for an economic recovery. Prime Minister David Cameron says Britain must stay the course. Lorna is offering an invitation to David Cameron to spend a week in her home to see how tough life can be when juggling a low-paying job, three children and ever-decreasing benefits. ""He would see how hard it is on a day-to-day basis,"" Lorna says, ""then there would be some changes to these reforms.""","Trussell Trust - a local communities charity on food banks - provided food aid to 128,697 Britons .

"(CNN) -- High winds and snow prompted airport and highway delays in some metropolitan areas Friday, potentially snarling holiday travel plans on one of the nation's busiest travel days. Flights headed to and leaving Newark, New Jersey, one of several airports serving New York City, were at risk of delays because of high winds in the area, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Delays were also reported early in the day at New York's LaGuardia airport. CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said wind could also trigger delays in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, while snow could pose a problem in Minneapolis. By Friday afternoon, however, Newark was reporting the only weather-related delay on the FAA's web site. Traffic departing from Baltimore was slightly delayed because of volume. The nation's busiest airport, in Atlanta, was reporting business as usual Friday. The airport had been shut down, affecting some 5,200 flights, when severe weather swept the South on Thursday. Some travelers ended up spending the night at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport after missing their connections. One man told CNN Friday his wife was driving from Charleston, South Carolina -- five hours away by car, one way -- because after he spent the night in the airport, the first two flights out Friday morning were full. Meanwhile, drivers in some areas weren't having much better luck. In New Mexico, a winter storm triggered the closure of Interstates 10 and 25, the state's Department of Transportation said. Interstate 10 was closed from Lordsburg to Las Cruces, and Interstate 25 was closed from Las Cruces north to Bernardo. A winter storm warning remained in effect for much of New Mexico through 11 p.m. Friday. Up to 8 inches of new snow was likely for elevations above 7,500 feet, according to the National Weather Service, but snow was forecast for all locations. Winds were forecast to gust up to 35 mph in some areas. ""Travel will be nearly impossible, at least this morning, with many road closures expected,"" the Weather Service said. ""Conditions will gradually improve between late this morning and this evening."" The same storm was also causing slippery roads in El Paso, Texas, according to CNN affiliates. Snow could also hamper travel in Colorado, especially the Boulder area, which saw 3 feet of snow on Thursday, Wolf said. South of Denver, the town of Castle Rock, Colorado, received about a foot of snow, said CNN iReporter Matthew Colver. ""Luckily, my grandson is here, just graduated from Marine boot camp, and he used my snow blower to clear the driveway and walkways,"" Colver said.

"(CNN) -- ""Be as paranoid as possible!"" The screed from our homeowner association manager arrived in our mailbox printed inside a cheery holiday border. The message continued: ""Our neighborhood is as safe as we make it. Make no mistake about it, you must be on your guard! Report suspicious behavior or individuals that do not belong in our community."" The call to arms echoed the strident sentiment of neighbors left nervous by the robbery of our home the day before. While we slept unaware at the back of an upscale gated community in Windermere, Florida, intruders came through the front door, took our big-screen TV, laptops and all of the presents from under the Christmas tree. No matter that we hadn't activated our security system and most likely forgot to lock the door. Hysterical efforts to fortify the perimeter were in full swing. An 8-foot iron fence was installed to seal the breach in the back wall used to circumvent the electronic entrance gate. An evening patrol was hired to circle in our eight-block subdivision. The developer sent apologetic champagne, and the homeowners association sent repeated encouragements to ""keep an eye out for anything unusual!"" Heavily marketed as havens of prestige and a sure footing on the social ladder, gated communities in Florida also create an insidious fortress mentality. Inside the enclaves that boast exclusivity and safety as their primary features, security means not just freedom from crime, but also protection from annoyances such as solicitors and strangers of any kind. You know, individuals that do not belong in our community. In other words, minorities and other less desirable social classes. This is the paradox of Florida's famed gated lifestyle, into which Trayvon Martin walked, was shot and tragically died. And within such communities, a neighborhood watch member such as George Zimmerman can get carried away. While we don't know what exactly happened in the encounter between Zimmerman and Martin, questions about racial profiling, vigilantism and police prejudice were slow in coming partly because of Florida's penchant for enclave living. The forting-up phenomenon that began in the 1960s shows no sign of slowing, ranking Florida as second only to California in the number of walls, street patterns and barricades that separate people from each other. Even though these features do not necessarily deliver on the promise of lower crime rate or more stable home value, they remain highly desirable. Their popularity complicates the debate over whether Martin or Zimmerman deserves the benefit of the doubt. ""For residents who aren't expecting people to be passing through, to be in their space, attitudes can be taken to the extreme,"" Eliza Harris, Orlando's representative at the Congress for the New Urbanism, told me. Fenced in against their own insecurity, residents living within the perimeter revere active vigilance. Those who want to play border patrol and muscle outsiders around can easily do so unchecked. ""When you discourage drive-through traffic and pedestrians, it becomes abnormal to see someone walking. And now you've created a situation where two people alone are hazardous to each other because there's no one else around, no cars driving by, no eyes on the street, "" Harris added. Today's cameras, fences, walls and gates do little to create an atmosphere of openness, which is an essential element in a diverse society. When segregation of our living spaces becomes the wallpaper we no longer see, communities become brittle, unable to prevent and shut down the most dangerous behavior. Our children deserve to grow up in a culture of responsibility that doesn't stop at the neighborhood gates. As the design of our communities becomes more divided, the ""as paranoid as possible"" citizens living in fear of those lurking outside of their walls too often overlook the more distressing attitudes within. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bonita Burton.","Bonita Burton: Gated communities in Florida create an insidious fortress mentality .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Chinese spaceship blasted off Tuesday from a launch center in the Gobi Desert, carrying three astronauts on what is expected to be the Asian giant's longest crewed mission yet. Propelled by a Long March-2F rocket, the Shenzhou 10 craft is scheduled to dock with the Tiangong-1 space module where the crew will transfer supplies to the space lab, which has been in orbit since September 2011. China has stepped up the pace of its space program since first sending astronaut Yang Liwei into orbit in 2003. In 2012, it conducted 18 space launches, according to the Pentagon. Tuesday's launch from the the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center marks the start of China's fifth crewed space mission. Footage broadcast by state broadcaster CCTV showed the craft lift off from the Gobi's flat expanse and arrow into the empty blue sky. Officials at the launch center looked on as it gained altitude, gradually shedding stages of the rocket. During its 15 days in orbit, the crew will master the rendezvous and docking capabilities that are essential for the operation of a manned space platform. ""The functionality, performance, and coordination of all systems will be evaluated during this mission,"" Wu Ping, a spokesperson for China's Manned Space Program, told a news conference on Monday ahead of the launch. She added that another main objective of the mission was to test technologies related to the construction of a space station as China seeks to establish a long-term human presence in space. The most recent crewed mission last year carried its first female astronaut and was the first to make a manual docking with the space module. The crew for this mission will also include a woman, Wang Yaping, and two male astronauts, Nie Haisheng and Zhang Xiaoguang. ""These longer duration missions and space dockings are essential practice for any kind of long-term, more permanent presence in space or a mission to, say, the moon,"" said Dean Cheng, a research fellow at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation. Growing power . China's march into space underscores the country's growing financial and military clout and has unsettled some Western observers. A 92-page report on Chinese military development released by the Pentagon last month highlighted the advances in China's space capabilities. ""China is developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its capabilities to limit or prevent the use of space-based assets by adversaries during times of crisis or conflict,"" the report said. A spokeswoman for China's manned space missions said last year the program would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan (US$6.27 billion). The U.S. closed its space shuttle program in 2011 and is no longer aggressively pursuing manned space exploration, leaving Russia and China as the only two countries in the world capable of independently sending humans into space. ""In some ways, they have overtaken the US, at least temporarily,"" says the Heritage Foundation's Cheng. ""Of course, the US, and even more Russia, have more experience in manned space. China is not, at this time, capable of reaching the Moon."" ""But like the tortoise and the hare, China is slowly catching up with the US."" However, Cheng says that China is not engaged in a space race with the US. Rather: ""They have a long-term plan, and they are sticking to it."" Private space ambitions . Companies like Boeing, Space X and Virgin Galactic are scrambling to develop private sector spacecraft and operate in what has previously been the exclusive preserve of sovereign nations. China is not part of the project that maintains the International Space Station (ISS), which currently orbits the Earth conducting experiments in a range of fields, from physics to astronomy. The ISS is a joint venture between NASA, Russia's RKA space agency, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency and the Canadian CSA. China views its multi-billion dollar space program as a way to raise prestige both domestically and abroad. This is the first high-profile space launch since new leader Xi Jinping assumed the presidency in March. Public reaction to the planned mission was mixed, with some users of the Twitter-like Weibo platform wishing the astronauts well, while others said the resources were best used on the ground. ""Our country may be lagging behind in other areas, but China has great achievement in aerospace technology,"" said one user with the handle @Jiniaobieliulin. ""The government should spend more money to help those of lowest social status,"" said another user identified as @Xiaoxiaojuna. Journalist Katie Hunt wrote and reported from Hong Kong, and CNN's Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A member of the Shiite militia Hezbollah, who escaped from an Egyptian prison during the recent unrest there, made a surprise appearance Wednesday at a Hezbollah rally in Beirut. The Hezbollah television network al Manar showed Sami Shehab being greeted by rapturous applause as he took the stage at the rally in a southern suburb of Beirut to mark the group's martyrs' day. Shehab, also known as Mohammed Yusuf Mansour, was accused by Egyptian authorities of leading a Hezbollah cell in Egypt and planning attacks in Egypt. He had been in prison for nearly two years before escaping on February 3 along with several members of the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas, Hezbollah officials said.

"(CNN) -- The massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has prompted the Obama administration to consider new gun laws, like banning high-capacity magazines. Up until now, this -- along with other policy changes -- has in part been hindered by the National Rifle Association, which has fought to keep gun laws lax despite the fact that most of the American public support reasonable gun legislation. While this time might be different, there are reasons to suspect this tragedy could end like the others -- with nothing changed. However, if gun control proponents were clever they could use new insights from behavioral economics to get the best of the NRA. The core reason the NRA seems to have a stranglehold on American politics is known in economics and political science as the ""collective action problem."" A majority of the public supports common-sense restrictions on firearms. But because the numerous gun control supporters do not care as deeply as the much smaller share of gun control opponents, they are far less mobilized. One of us has seen firsthand what it's like to go around testifying at legislative bodies about gun policy. Over the years, the stands are filled with gun control opponents. Gun control supporters are largely absent. Highly visible tragedies periodically inspire what former President Richard Nixon would call the ""silent majority"" to act. The problem is that action is difficult to sustain over the long run by a large number of people who also care about other things as well. Just look at the Million Mom March. On Mother's Day in 2000, an estimated 750,000 people marched on the National Mall in Washington to call for tougher gun laws. The rally was in reaction to the tragic shootings at the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center and Columbine High School, which both occurred the year before. The grass-roots reaction was supposed to usher in an era of common sense policies to curb gun violence. But then people got busy and distracted, and things fizzled. In 2001, the rally attracted only about 100 supporters. Today, federal gun laws are actually weaker than a decade ago. For example, the federal ban on assault weapons expired in 2004 and Congress has not renewed it. Right now there is a brief window of opportunity for people who feel passionately about gun control to do something. The key for gun control proponents is to figure out how to turn people's willingness to take a single action in a moment into an effortless and sustainable long-term commitment. Here's one way to defeat the NRA: Ask people who are upset about this recent shooting to go online and sign up for automatic, monthly deductions to a fund devoted to breaking the grip of the NRA. For every dollar the NRA spends in helping a political candidate, this new fund would spend $2 to help the opponent (whether in a primary race or general election). Many politicians are currently afraid that opposing the NRA would lead the organization to stop providing their campaigns with either cash contributions or in-kind support (such as advertisements and other forms of advocacy). Creating a fund that guaranteed a two-to-one match of NRA support -- but for the other side, ideally who supports stronger gun control -- would weaken the NRA's political clout. And how much should gun control proponents ask people to pledge? According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA spent about $20 million on political activities in the 2012 election cycle; including a little more than $1 million on direct campaign contributions and around $8.5 million on independent campaigns in support of congressional candidates. This might sound like a lot of money, but it is equal to only about 2% of what Obama raised in 2012 and less than one-tenth of one percent of the net worth of the NRA's most vocal critic: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Suppose Bloomberg agreed to give one-tenth of one percent of his net worth each year, and gun control groups asked people to pledge the same percentage of their net worth. The cost to most people to match would be not more than $10 or $20 per month. While people could opt out any time, most people would never even notice this small automatic deduction. This strategy will work because it changes the default behavior of busy people from political passivity to activism. A few election cycles might be needed for the NRA and politicians to see the consequences of such a pledge. But when it happens -- when the NRA's grip is weakened significantly -- then perhaps America will see true policy changes on gun control through the active support of its public. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ethan Bueno de Mesquita and Jens Ludwig.","Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Jens Ludwig: Use behavioral economics to fight the NRA .
Mesquita, Ludwig: The key is to turn a single action into a long-term commitment .

"Washington (CNN) -- TSA officers rescued a woman from two kidnappers as a group of travelers passed through a security checkpoint at Miami International Airport, the Transportation Security Administration said. In the July 5 incident, the two TSA behavior detection officers, trained to spot terrorists in passenger lines, noticed the 25-year-old woman trembling and trying to hide facial injuries at an airline ticket counter. The woman at first said she was fine, but later broke down crying and said she had been kidnapped, the TSA said. The officers separated the woman from her four travel partners, leading to her rescue and the arrest of two women in the group on kidnapping and other charges, the TSA said. ""Our officers recognized that the woman was in danger and acted immediately to protect her,"" said Mark Hatfield, the TSA's federal security director for Miami International Airport. The incident was first reported Tuesday by Miami television station NBC 6, a day before a congressional hearing on TSA screener misconduct. Several TSA officials said the timing of the news release was coincidental. Nonetheless, TSA Deputy Administrator John Halinski mentioned the kidnapping case as an example of good work being done by agency employees. TSA to speed flight attendants through security . ""We stopped a kidnapping basically though the quick thinking and the abilities of our BDO (behavior detection officers),"" he told the committee. A North Miami Police Department report gave this account: . The incident began when the victim and four friends came to Miami from New Jersey to celebrate the Fourth of July. The following day -- July 5 -- the woman was alone at a Best Western hotel when her four friends returned from an outing, apparently intoxicated. While the victim was lying in bed, one woman accused her of having intimate relations with her boyfriend and ""began to violently punch her numerous times in the face."" When the woman stopped punching her, a second woman punched her in the face several times. The victim locked herself in a bathroom, but her two attackers struck her again when she left the bathroom. The two other friends ""refused to get involved,"" the report says. The attackers took jewelry from her, took money from her purse and went to an ATM, where they withdrew money from the victim's account, it says. The group took a taxi to the Miami airport, and while they were at a ticket counter, a TSA behavior detection officer noticed the victim's injuries. The officer said that one woman ""didn't seem comfortable with the people she was traveling with,"" the TSA said in a statement. The victim at first said she was fine, but a TSA officer ""re-engaged the woman and she broke down crying and stated she was kidnapped,"" the statement said. ""The victim was pulled away by TSA Agents before reaching the travel document check point and Airport Police were called,"" the TSA said. Police questioned the woman's four travel partners and arrested the two women. Police identified the women as Tori Beato, 19, of Secaucus, New Jersey, and Melissa Pineiro, 25, of North Bergen, New Jersey. Beato and Pineiro are charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and related charges. Both have been released on bond, police said, and efforts by CNN to reach them were unsuccessful. Beato's listed phone number was no longer in service, and Pineiro did not immediately return a call for comment. At Wednesday's hearing on screener misconduct, the TSA defended its workforce, saying that most screeners behave professionally and that the agency works aggressively to weed out unprofessional workers. Deputy Administrator Halinski said criticism of the agency comes chiefly from the media, bloggers and politicians. Of the 600 million passengers screened every year, about 750,000 initiate contact with the TSA, and less than 8% of them register complaints, he said. TSA: Eight Newark officers fired for violating procedures . ""When you look at the large number of passengers that are going through, I think that statistic speaks for itself,"" Halinski said. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, chairman of the subcommittee, agreed that only a small subset of TSA workers are unprofessional, but he said the frequency of TSA misconduct ""is a symptom of a larger problem."" ""In some cases, we've seen poor screener performance going uncorrected or, even worse, being encouraged or covered up or by TSA management,"" he said, noting a 2011 case in which TSA employees at a Honolulu airport were failing to check baggage for explosives. ""TSA's own federal security director was in on it,"" Rogers said. ""One of these cases is too many, but there have been others disturbing since then, including airports in southwest Florida, Philadelphia, JFK and Newark."" Said Halinski: ""I'm not saying we're different from any other group of Americans. I'm saying we're exactly like any group of Americans.""","Agency says behavior detection officers noticed suspicious group at Miami airport .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Thirty years after hundreds died in a fight over the disputed Falkland Islands, the Argentine president on Thursday urged Britain to once again try to resolve the conflict -- this time, at the negotiating table. ""We have to leave behind us this outdated story, this outdated history, and build a new history based on dialogue,"" President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said at the U.N. headquarters in New York during a meeting of the world body's decolonization committee. ""We're not asking that we're told we are right, we're just asking to talk,"" she said. ""We are not asking for anyone to say, yes, the Malvinas are Argentinas: We are asking for no more, no less, than to sit down at a table and talk."" Argentina invaded the Falklands -- known as the Malvinas in Argentina -- in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinian and 255 British troops died. Following the war, Britain retained control of the islands, which are off Argentina's coast in the South Atlantic Ocean. About 2,500 people from ""over 150 nationalities"" now live and work on the islands, in addition to 1,700 stationed at the British military's Mount Pleasant Complex there, according to the islands' government website. Argentina has persistently criticized the British presence and has renewed its claims to the islands. But some British leaders have fought back, with Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this year describing Argentina's stance as ""far more like colonialism, because these people want to remain British."" Roger Edwards, a member of the Falkland Islands legislature, told the U.N. committee on Thursday that Argentina was not only trying to prevent people from exercising ""our democratic rights,"" but they were ignoring what transpired three decades earlier. ""I accept that Argentina has changed, and I am pleased that it has,"" Edwards said. ""However, I do not understand how the government of Argentina can absolve itself and its people from its recent past, while simultaneously seeking to punish and harm a small and peaceful Falkland Islands' people for something it incorrectly claims to have happened almost two centuries ago."" The legislator was referring to Argentina's claim that Britain forcibly wrested the islands from its control in 1833. An account by British Foreign Secretary William Hague on the Falklands' government website claims that Britain first possessed the islands in 1765 -- decades before Argentina achieved independence from Spanish imperial rule. Edwards insisted Thursday that 'the islands were never Argentine (and) no Argentines were ever forcibly expelled from the islands in 1833."" Yet Kirchner, in her passionate testimony Thursday, insisted that Britain does not have a rightful, historical claim to the islands. And geographically, she said, it makes no sense. ""How can it be claimed with 14,000 kilometers away, that this territory is part of British territory?"" she said. Kirchner also pointed to a host of U.N. resolutions addressing decolonization. She suggested that it was no coincidence that these measures had had no effect on London's sovereignty over the Falklands. ""In reality, what's happening here is the United Kingdom is benefiting from its privileged position as a permanent member of the (U.N.) security council,"" she said.","Argentina's president tells a U.N. panel: ""We're just asking to talk"" about Falkland Islands .

But he risks his life just to help his tight-knit central Texas city. On Wednesday night, the valor of the volunteers was put to the ultimate test. Firefighters were already battling an enormous blaze at West Fertilizer Co. when an earth-shaking explosion blasted windows and walls off homes.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A snack food truck driver was in a Mexican hospital Friday after his vehicle was set on fire, the latest in a string of attacks on his employer, a company spokeswoman said. ""We do not know who is responsible for this act or what their motive may have been,"" said Aurora Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, the owner of the Mexican snack food distributor Sabritas. ""Sabritas is deeply concerned that any employee would be put in danger or harmed."" The 29-year-old driver suffered burns over 70% of his body, officials said. Last weekend, five Sabritas distribution centers were set alight and about 40 delivery trucks were destroyed in the states of Michoacan and Guanajuato, the site of a turf war between cartels. Sabritas distributes snacks, including Cheetos, Fritos, Ruffles and Doritos. It says it controls 80% of the snack market in Mexico. Drug cartel members have posted banners saying the snack company let law enforcement agents use its trucks for surveillance, a charge Gonzalez denied. ""Sabritas is a food company that uses its facilities and other privately owned assets to make, move and sell our products to our customers and consumers,"" she said. Mexico's vice minister of the interior, Obdulio Avila, said authorities have been in touch with officials from PepsiCo and other companies about what they are doing to protect businesses. ""We will not allow organized crime to threaten any person or company in our country,"" he said. ""The federal government will take all the action necessary to bring to justice those criminals who threaten the source of income for the Mexican people.""

"(CNN) -- Cuba President Raul Castro removed two longtime government leaders loyal to his brother Fidel and promoted younger technocrats, according to state-run media and a U.S. analyst. The communist government's state council announced Thursday the removal of Jose Ramon Fernandez Alvarez as vice president of the council of ministers, according to state-run Granma. Fernandez, who is in his 80s, was the U.S.-trained head of the Cuban military force that defeated the U.S.-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs, said CNN analyst Carlos Alberto Montaner. Also removed from office was Jose M. Miyar Barrueco, who was minister of science, technology and environment, Granma reported. Miyar is considered the last Fidelista -- or loyalist to former Cuban president Fidel Castro -- in Raul Castro's government, Montaner said. Miyar was Fidel Castro's personal secretary, Montaner said. ""Publicly, Raul did not feel too comfortable with Miyar,"" Montaner said. ""Raul is completing the government with people who are close to him."" Fernadnez and Miyar were assigned to other government posts, Granma said. Replacing Fernandez is Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, an engineer in his early 50s who comes from the Communist youth party, Montaner said. Diaz-Canel who, was minister of higher education, Granma said, was replaced by First Deputy Minister Rodolfo Alarcon Ortiz, Granma said.

"(CNN) -- Mexico's frontal assault against drug cartels has been ""largely ineffective"" and in some instances counterproductive to reducing violence, a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report concludes. The report, released Thursday, was produced by the committee's majority staff ahead of a political transition in Mexico's presidency and the U.S. election, both events that could alter binational cooperation. Going forward, a focal point of anti-drug cooperation should be training and institution-building in Mexico's police forces and judiciary, the report says. By training police and equipping them to investigate drug-related killings, the military component of Mexico's current strategy can be scaled back, the report says. Mexico's Nieto calls for 'new debate' on the drug war . Mexican President Felipe Calderon's term, which comes to an end in December, will be remembered for a surge in the number of troops deployed across Mexico to help combat drug cartels. A number of high-ranking cartel figures have been arrested, but critics question if the government has achieved anything other than a reshaping of the factions fighting for control of lucrative smuggling routes. As the market for which a majority of the illegal drugs are destined, the United States has contributed to Mexico's efforts through the Merida Initiative. Congress has appropriated more than $1.9 billion for the initiative, which has provided helicopters and equipment, as well as training for police and judges. The report calls for continuation of Merida funds, but says they should be aimed at helping the police and judiciary. ""Mexico's presidential transition provides a new window to discuss and debate the best security strategies to deal with the serious violence plaguing Mexico,"" Committee Chairman Sen. John Kerry said in a written statement. ""As the political landscape continues to change in both countries, this report underscores the importance of continuity in two critical areas -- judicial and police reform. Mexicans have committed to these fundamental reforms and as tough as they will be to implement they are fundamental for any sustained reduction in violence in Mexico. These are worthy efforts that must succeed."" Alleged Mexican cartel operative 'La Bonita' arrested . According to the report, which was based on interviews in Mexico with authorities from both countries, as well as experts, Mexico has so far been slow to accept training for officers. Merida Funds for the current fiscal year will be largely directed toward capacity-building, and the report recommends that the United States continue to stress the importance of reforms. The report recommends continuing Merida funds at $250 million a year for four more years. Even if Mexico resorts to using the military as a stop-gap measure to combat the violence, ""increased civilian police capabilities will obviate the need to deploy military personnel for domestic security purposes,"" the report says. Mexico's federal police force has made strides in both size and capacity over the past several years, but reforms in state and local police departments have lagged, the report states. The Mexican government can succeed only if it enlists the help of state and local police, the report says. It is a tall order -- corruption is most prevalent at the local and state levels, where officers are routinely on the payrolls of the various drug trafficking organizations. Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico's presumptive president-elect, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria this week that he is open to a new debate on how to wage the war on drug trafficking, which will include a review with U.S. participation. ""What we seek now in our new strategy is to adjust what's been done up until now. It's not a radical change. It's to broaden the coverage and, above all, the emphasis I aspire to of reducing the violence in our country,"" Pena Nieto said.

"(CNN)  -- A controversial ranking of U.S. cities' crime rates indicates New Orleans, Louisiana, has the worst crime rate, while a New York exurb has the lowest. A New Orleans resident talks to police after returning home to find his house had been looted in September. The CQ Press ""City Crime Rankings"" list named New Orleans its most crime-ridden city based on a reported 19,000-plus incidences of six major crimes -- including 209 murder cases -- in 2007. The Gulf Coast city of about 250,000, still grappling with the aftermath of 2005's Hurricane Katrina, was followed in the rankings by Camden, New Jersey; Detroit, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; and Oakland, California. The lowest crime rate was reported in Ramapo, New York, about 40 miles northwest of New York City, with only 688 total crimes and no reported killings in a city of about 113,000. It was followed by Mission Viejo, California, south of Los Angeles; O'Fallon, Missouri, outside St. Louis; Newton, Massachusetts, west of Boston; and Brick Township, on the New Jersey coast. Previous editions have been criticized by criminologists and the U.S. Conference of Mayors as a misreading of federal crime statistics. The FBI, which compiles its own Uniform Crime Report statistics, warns that ranking cities against each other can produce ""simplistic and/or incomplete analyses,"" and the American Society of Criminology called last year's CQ report ""an irresponsible misuse of the data."" The study's publishers said they dropped previous characterizations of ""safest"" and ""most dangerous"" from this year's study, calling those qualities ""perceptions of the individuals who live in these communities."" But they defended the comparisons as a valuable tool for researchers and the public. ""The book provides the means by which individuals can compare local communities to other similar communities based on comparison to the national level of reported crime as well as crime rates per 100,000 of individual types of reported crime, violent and property crime categories, and overall,"" the company says in a statement accompanying the data. The CQ report rated 397 cities larger than 75,000 and 356 metropolitan areas, some of which ranked very differently from their core cities alone. The New Orleans area was third on the metropolitan-areas list, behind Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee. Camden, the second-worst city on the cities list, ranked 219th among metro areas. Among metro areas, Logan, Utah, north of Salt Lake City, had the lowest crime rate, followed by State College, Pennsylvania, and Ithaca, New York, the report said.. The data is drawn from FBI statistics on murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft.","New Orleans had 209 murders in 2007, according to CQ Press .

"(CNN) -- In a stunning story of survival and recovery, the Pakistani teenager whom Taliban gunman shot in the head in October has been released from a hospital. Malala Yousufzai left Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England, on Friday. In the past two weeks, the girl famous for advocating that girls in Pakistan be educated -- which stoked the ire of her attackers -- proved her incredible strength by enduring two operations to repair her skull and restore her hearing. The gunfire caused swelling in Malala's skull and a break in the delicate bones that help turn sound into sensory impulses to her brain. ""God has given me this new life,"" she recently said, speaking for the first time on camera since the shooting. ""I want to serve the people. I want every girl, every child, to be educated."" Though the gunshots to her neck and head made many doubt that she would walk again, Malala continued to improve over the past several months. ""I can walk a little bit and I'm feeling better,"" the 15-year-old said on February 6. At that time, she said she hoped to be fully recovered in a month. Her medical team decided she was well enough to be discharged Thursday. The teen will continue her rehabilitation at her family's temporary home in Birmingham and will visit the hospital occasionally for outpatient appointments. Malala has credited her survival to ""the prayers of the people."" Her story captured worldwide attention, moving Pakistan to vow that it would more vigorously fight for girls' rights and against the Taliban. It also prompted global leaders to put pressure on the country to make good on those promises. ""Because of these prayers, God has given me this new life and I want to serve and I want every girl, every child to be educated,"" she said. Malala has already started talking about furthering the cause that enraged the Taliban. In 2009, she wrote an extraordinary blog published by the BBC about how she wanted to go to school but was afraid. ""The Taliban have repeatedly targeted schools in Swat,"" she wrote. About that time, the Taliban issued a formal edict, which covered her home in Pakistan's Swat Valley, banning all girls from schools. On the blog, Malala praised her father, who was operating one of the few schools that would go on to defy that order. ""My father said that some days ago someone brought the printout of this diary saying how wonderful it was,"" she wrote. ""My father said that he smiled, but could not even say that it was written by his daughter."" Malala soon garnered international attention. She started giving interviews with news outlets, including CNN. ""I have the right of education,"" she said in a 2011 interview with CNN. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Why do you risk your life to raise your voice? a reporter asked her. In perfect English, she answered that her people need her. ""I shall raise my voice,"" she insisted. ""If I didn't do it, who would?"" she said. Girls who are scared should fight their fear, she said. ""Don't sit in your bedrooms. ""God will ask you on the day of judgment, 'Where were you when your people were asking you ... when your school fellows were asking you and when your school was asking you ...'Why I am being blown up?' "" On October 9, Taliban assassins attacked a van that carried Malala and other schoolchildren. They demanded that the children identify her. Terrified, the children did it, and the men fired, wounding two other girls in addition to hitting Malala. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" a Taliban spokesman later said, as Malala, in a Pakistani hospital, breathed with the help of a ventilator. The Taliban vowed that if Malala survived, they would come after her again.","15-year-old Pakistani advocate for girls' education rights leaves British hospital .

"Editor's Note: Actress Drew Barrymore is an Ambassador Against Hunger for the U.N.' s World Food Program. Drew Barrymore says a tiny amount of money can bring nourishment and education to impoverished children. (CNN) -- I made my first trip to Nairobi after reading an article in The New York Times about schools and how they can change a child's life. Dollars could do wonders for one child in a year in Africa, providing food and education, it said, while children in so many other parts of the world have the luxury to spend that money on miscellaneous fun. The article made me feel one person could actively help another person; that I could tangibly help a child in need. A problem that had seemed so vast, so untouchable to me, suddenly felt smaller and more contained -- at least for the moment. I picked up the phone and called the United Nations and told them that I would love to further educate myself on what they do and would more than anything love to go with them on a trip to Africa to see things firsthand. In 2005, I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to be invited by the U.N.'s World Food Program. I took my documentary crew with me; we spent a couple of weeks in Kenya. Being with these children and traveling to many different schools by bus, train and plane all through Kenya and in Nairobi was life-altering. And what really pushed everything forward for me was speaking to the children and the families themselves.  See photos from Drew Barrymore's trip to Nairobi, Kenya » . I was astonished to learn what the mothers have to go through when infected with HIV -- the bond created among these families, when children bring their mothers part of their daily food ration to sustain them so they can take their medicines.  Watch as Drew Barrymore discusses her work with the World Food Programme » . In these places I was able to see what the schools require in order to continue and what resources are necessary, what the WFP does and how I could help. I was given an opportunity to sit in these families' homes and hear their stories. I saw how feeding these children in school enabled them to pay attention and learn. That was my first trip and I came back knowing that this was for me. I returned to Africa again in 2007 and once again visited the schools and spent time with the families, along with marathon runner and two-time Olympic silver medalist Paul Tergat, a fellow WFP ambassador against hunger. His life story is truly inspirational -- in fact, he received school lunches from WFP as a little boy while attending primary school in Kenya's Baringo district. As an ambassador for the WFP, I have had the honor to work in the field overseas, but also here in the United States. What has always struck me about the WFP's Red Cup campaign is its ease and inclusive nature. Everyone can be a part of saving another person's life. The numbers continue to astonish me in their ability to bring nourishment and education to those children -- 25 cents a day, $5 a month, $50 a year can feed a child and offer them the opportunity for an education, which is a fundamental right. It was incredible to be on ""Oprah"" donating $1 million to WFP; but my heart was lifted so much higher when I saw the donations that followed from inspired students, working adults, mothers, fathers, daughters, people all across the United States, giving what they could to additionally raise over $500,000 that will fill the cups of children in WFP schools across the globe. One person's quarter can fill a child's cup. In this domestic fieldwork, I joined up again with Josette Sheeran, the executive director of the WFP, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to address rising food prices firsthand. Josette and I banded together again at the Clinton Global Initiative, where school feeding programs were brought to the forefront. Words cannot express the energy that filled me when I saw Bill Clinton holding the WFP Red Cup. It's the same red cup that sits on my desk, that carries in it stories of children and families struggling, that carries in it the message that just the smallest amount of money will fill that cup and will feed a child and will educate that child and give her the chance to continue through this world and make a difference of her own. That, to me, is what the World Food Program is all about -- people helping people -- and that is why I'm so very grateful to be an ambassador against hunger. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Drew Barrymore.","Drew Barrymore: Nourishment and education are fundamental rights .

"(CNN) -- North and South Korea have agreed to hold working-level military talks at the truce village of Panmunjom next week, the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday. In the talks, scheduled for February 8, the South will demand that Pyongyang take responsibility for last year's military provocations, the ministry said last month. Higher-level military talks will only be held if the North promises to refrain from further provocations. The Seoul government also has proposed holding inter-Korean talks between high-ranking government officials to discuss denuclearization, something the North has not yet agreed to. North Korea cut off direct contact with the South on May 26 to protest Seoul's response to the March sinking of a South Korean naval ship. South Korea has blamed North Korea for the attack, which killed 46 sailors. Pyongyang denies any involvement in the sinking of the Cheonan. Tensions rose again in November, when North Korea shelled South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. North Korea said the strike was in response to the South's navy firing into Northern waters.","The working-level military talks are scheduled for February 8 .

"(CNN) -- The leader of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon says that Arab regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the United States and Israel. In a televised address carried by Hezbollah's station al Manar, Hassan Nasrallah said those regimes had lost the support and respect of their own people. Hezbollah -- a Shi'ite movement -- has often criticized the largely Sunni-led governments in the Arab world. But Nasrallah's language Monday came close to promoting their overthrow. The Hezbollah leader said he had not spoken before about the situation in Egypt because he did not want to be accused of meddling in Egypt's affairs. In a taunting reference to the Mubarak government's claim that Hezbollah has been active in Egypt, Nasrallah said the militia's friends and supporters there had recommended it should not speak up about the situation. Nasrallah's comments come as the people of Lebanon wait anxiously for the formation of a new government. The Cabinet led by Saad Hariri was brought down last month, and Hezbollah has emerged as the most powerful force in a possible new government. At the same time, tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of Hezbollah with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, Saad's father, in 2005. Hezbollah has turned on the U.N. Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination, describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States. Saad Hariri says his party won't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal. Positions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of Rafik Hariri's death on February 14. The daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to Najib Mikati -- a billionaire Sunni businessman involved in telecommunications, construction and other businesses. He has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis, Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon's many parties. Some Lebanese politicians, notably the veteran Nabih Berri, a Shiite, are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within a week. Others foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as Lebanon awaits the publication of the tribunal's indictments, which for now are sealed. Lebanon's old divisions -- Christian against Sunni against Shiite -- are now more complex. Some Christian families, notably the Gemayels and their Kataeb party, are allied with the Sunni Hariri's party and want to see Hezbollah's wings clipped. Besides its political strength, Hezbollah's militia numbers thousands of well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel. But another prominent Christian, Michel Aoun, is allied with the Shiite Hezbollah. And Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the minority Druze community, has deserted Hariri for the pro-Syrian Hezbollah, even though Jumblat's father was killed by the Syrians. Aoun was brutally honest about his choice: ""We have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with Hezbollah."" In other words, the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize Lebanon. Many view Lebanon as an emerging battleground between Iran and Syria on the one hand and pro-Western forces on the other.","Hassan Nasrallah: Arab regimes have lost the respect of their people .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro announced on Monday that the Communist Party will hold a long-delayed congress next April as the country struggles to reshape its Soviet economic model. There hasn't been a congress since 1997. Castro postponed one scheduled for the end of 2009 so the government could focus on preventing a full-blown economic crisis. Castro made the announcement alongside Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at an activity to renew a social and economic pact between the two countries. The congress will also be important because it will determine if Fidel Castro will stay on as the head of the Communist Party, ­ the only legal party in Cuba. He stepped down in 2006 and has renounced all other titles. This will be the party's sixth congress since Fidel Castro seized power in 1959. The meetings are used to set policy.","Cuba's last Communist Party congress was in 1997 .

"(CNN) -- A French journalist reporting alongside soldiers is missing in Colombia after a leftist rebel group attacked their unit, killing four people and injuring six, officials said Sunday. Romeo Langlois, who works for France 24, is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country, said Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon. According to preliminary reports, Langlois was shot in his arm before he disappeared, the minister said. The attack by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as the FARC, took place in the southern Caqueta province as soldiers worked to destroy cocaine laboratories. A sergeant, two soldiers and a national police officer were killed, the defense ministry said; six others were injured. On Sunday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French media that Langlois had been taken prisoner. France 24 reported its editors were working with authorities in both countries to gather information on the journalist. ""We know that it's a difficult region,"" said Nahida Nakad, editorial director of Audiovisuel Exterieur de la France, of which France 24 is a part, the television network reported. ""Of course we are very worried, but we have every confidence in Romeo who knows the territory very well and is an experienced journalist. We hope that he is safe and sound, and we are in constant contact with his family."" A FARC-sympathetic news agency that often publishes official statements from the group blamed the incident on the Colombian government. His disappearance ""is the responsibility of the government of Colombia for engaging in their ranks a foreign national as a correspondent of war,"" said an editorial posted by the New Colombia News Agency. The soldiers had destroyed five laboratories, with a total capacity to produce two tons of cocaine per week, the Colombian defense ministry said. Pinzon on Friday condemned the rebel group for a separate incident, attacks in Caqueta that left three civilians dead, one of them a baby. He reported a major blow against the rebels in the northern part of the country. A special operation by the army and national police in Antioquia killed ""Brenda,"" the second leader of the company in the area, he said. It also led to the capture of ""Richard,"" or ""The Mechanic,"" chief financial officer of the Alfonso Castellanos company of FARC in Arauca. The rebel group has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, and uses kidnapping forces and civilians as a key strategy. While severely weakened in recent years, it continues to carry out kidnappings and attacks on security forces. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","French journalist Romeo Langlois is missing .

Castro underwent surgery more than a month ago in a Miami hospital to remove a tumor in her lung, her biographer and spokesperson, journalist Maria Antonieta Collins, said. Collins said Castro is recovering well and her diagnosis is very good. ""I am in the best medical hands, receiving the proper treatment,"" Castro said on her website. ""It's a serious condition, but I'm not at the side of my grave."" Castro released an autobiography last year titled ""My Brothers Fidel and Raul, the Secret History."" The notoriously private Castro decided to go public about her condition unlike her ailing brother Fidel Castro. Fidel Castro fell ill in 2006 of a as yet unspecified stomach ailment.

"(CNN) -- There have been no reports of major damage or injuries in the wake of a magnitude 6.8 earthquake in Chile, according to the country's leader. President Sebastián Piñera told TV Chile that the quake was felt from Valparaíso, north of Santiago, to the lake region in the south. He also said it was probably an aftershock of a massive and deadly temblor that rocked the region in February 2010. Piñera arrived in Santiago to assess the situation a little over an hour after Friday's earthquake occurred. It struck in the early afternoon off the coast of central Chile, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, with the Earth rupturing at a depth of 17.4 miles (28 kilometers) under the sea off the Biobío region. The epicenter was 30 miles (45 kilometers) north of Concepción, the regional capital and the second-largest city in Chile. Hundreds died there after a magnitude 8.8 earthquake rocked the city February 27, 2010. Residents of coastal towns near Concepción self-evacuated, according to an Interior Ministry official. ""This was done as a precaution,"" Rodrigo Ubilla told TV Chile. ""We are calm and assured that there was no major damage."" Images from Concepción showed hundreds of people crying in the streets after fleeing office buildings and high-rise apartments. The city is still rebuilding from last year's quake. There has been at least one strong aftershock from Friday's earthquake. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center never believed that a tsunami would affect any coastal regions, according to a statement released shortly after the quake. No tsunami watches or warnings were issued. CNN's Brian Byrnes contributed to this report.","NEW: Chilean President Sebastián Piñera says no major injuries reported .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- A record crowd in Cairo's Tahrir Square swelled Tuesday afternoon, a sea of Egyptians from every walk of life in a demonstration dubbed the ""march of millions."" Tens of thousands prayed on their knees on the asphalt in unison under the sprawling city's winter sun, and then chanted ""leave, leave"" in a deafening roar to their president, Hosni Mubarak. As the throngs congregated, Egypt's Nile TV showed live pictures of car traffic crossing a bridge over the Nile River, with bulletins announcing that a curfew would be imposed again on Tuesday starting at 3 p.m. Soldiers and plain-clothed security officers searched demonstrators and controlled access to Tahrir, or Liberation Square, which has been the focal point of protests against Egypt's embattled Mubarak, 82. After the first lines of security, scores of self-appointed volunteers from the protest movement conducted their own searches of bags, and ordered arriving people to show their identity cards as they streamed in. One man handed out leaflets, urging demonstrators to behave in front of foreign journalists covering the event. ""As you know all media organizations are here to follow your efforts,"" the leaflet read, ""In order to show Egypt in a positive light, we insist that you follow a peaceful approach in expressing your requests and ideas."" Men and women continued a practice that has sprung up here over the last week... standing alone in the street, holding up hand-made signs, and posing proudly for the cell phone photos of passers-by. ""Mubarak has been here since Ronald Reagan,"" shouted one man, who held up a sign that said ""Get Out Mubarak"" in English. Said El Sisi, 23, said he and his father and brother traveled two hours on five different buses from their village outside Cairo to attend the demonstration. ""I'd like to see change in my country,"" El Sisi said, as he walked slowly with hordes of people through security checkpoints towards the square. ""I'd like to see a president in Egypt every eight years like in other countries. ...this is just the country of rich people. I graduated from university and I speak four languages but I can't find a job because of nepotism and corruption. To do anything you have to pay money."" Many Egyptian opposition parties have embraced today's demonstration, which was promoted through fliers and leaflets, since the government has shut down almost all of the internet connections in the country. ""Today we are all together in Tahrir Square,"" said George Issac, a member of the opposition group Kefaya, which means ""Enough"" in English. ""This revolution is a revolution of the young generation. We are just supporters,"" Issac said. He claimed Egypt's long repressed opposition parties were working together with one goal, to remove President Hosni Mubarak. In another part of Cairo, an aide to Ayman Nour said the former opposition candidate for president was holding talks with officials from the liberal secular opposition Al Wafd party. ""You can not call us Kefaya or Muslim Brotherhood or leftists or anything,"" Issac explained. ""We talk today as Egyptians."" But Issac also said his party opposed the announced goal of some demonstrators, who planned to march from Tahrir Square to the Presidential Palace. ""I send a message for all the demonstrators. Don't leave the square,"" Issac said, in a telephone interview with CNN. A march of tens of thousands of people, if not more, would put the protesters in tense confrontations with the Egyptian troops who have established checkpoints throughout the city. At the outskirts of Tahrir Square, army officers drove a truck blaring patriotic music from loudspeakers. On Monday, the military announced it would not use force against the demonstrators. ""The presence of the armed forces in the Egyptian streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace,"" an unnamed military spokesman announced on state television Monday night. ""Your armed forces will not use violence against this great people, who have always played a significant role in every moment of Egypt's great history."" And deeper in the throngs of jubilant protesters, one of the men who searched arriving participants wore a camouflage military uniform underneath civilian pants and jacket in an apparent effort to blend in with the crowd.","Crowds chant for Mubarak to leave .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- Havana is ready and willing to start a dialogue with Washington, Cuban President Raul Castro said in a speech to parliament Saturday, but warned that political and regime change are not up for negotiation. Raul Castro warns his critics there will not be any upcoming change in Cuba's political philosophy. ""They didn't elect me president to restore capitalism in Cuba, nor to surrender the revolution,"" Castro said to loud applause. ""I was elected to defend, maintain and continue perfecting socialism, not to destroy it."" He added that those expecting political change after the death of former President Fidel Castro and his generation were ""condemned to fail."" Castro ceded the presidency to his younger brother, Raul, last year but has retained leadership of the Communist Party, the only legal political party in Cuba. There has been speculation that the elder Castro will step down from that post as well at the next Communist Party Congress. Fidel Castro, who had run Cuba since 1959, has not appeared in public since abdominal surgery in 2006. Raul Castro's speech was given to a biannual session of the National Assembly and largely focused on Cuba's economy.  Watch a report on the state of the Communist Party » . Castro called some of the measures taken by the Obama administration ""positive,"" but said, for Cuba, the main stumbling block remains the U.S. trade embargo, which has been in place in one form or another since 1960.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Raul Castro's government in Cuba continues to repress civil rights and persecute dissenters three years after he became the communist nation's top leader, Human Rights Watch says in a report released Wednesday. Raul Castro took over in July 2006, when older brother Fidel became ill and was no longer able to rule after more than 47 years in charge. The new dictator has locked up scores of people and allowed scores more that had been jailed by Fidel Castro to remain behind bars, Human Rights Watch says. ""Rather than dismantle Cuba's repressive machinery, Raul Castro has kept it firmly in place and fully active,"" the report says. Cuban government officials in Washington rejected the conclusions reached in the report, titled ""New Castro, Same Cuba."" ""Cuba does not recognize the legality nor the moral authority of HRW as an organization that defends human rights,"" said Alberto Gonzalez, spokesman for Cuba's diplomatic office in Washington. ""HRW is an organization that analyzes this topic in a discriminatory, selective and above all politicized way. Its evaluation of human rights in Cuba is illegitimate and illegal."" Critics of the Cuban government agree with the rights group's conclusion that nothing has changed despite the new leadership. ""Everyone thought there would be change, but there is no change,"" said Angel Padilla, head of the Disidente Universal group in Puerto Rico. Some analysts even see a reversal in human rights. ""While there has been some economic reforms and political openings under Raul, the human rights picture has worsened. There is a greater police presence on the streets,"" said Ann Louise Bardach, whose book ""Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana, and Washington"" was published last month. ""Raul's inner circle have unbridled contempt for the dissidents,"" Bardach told CNN. Raul Castro has relied on a law dealing with ""dangerousness"" to foster much of the repression, Human Rights Watch said. ""Dangerousness"" allows authorities to jail people before they have committed any crime, on the suspicion that they are likely to commit an offense. ""In his three years in power, Raul Castro has been just as brutal as his brother,"" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. ""Cubans who dare to criticize the government live in perpetual fear, knowing they could wind up in prison for merely expressing their views."" The report is based on 60 extensive interviews Human Rights Watch researchers conducted in June and July in seven of Cuba's 14 provinces and by telephone from New York City. The research uncovered more than 40 cases in which Cuba jailed citizens under the ""dangerousness"" provision. The government also uses other harsh laws to silence free speech, quash labor rights and criminalize all forms of association, the report says. Human rights violations include abusive interrogations, the denial of legal counsel and sham trials, the report says. In addition, the report says, ""political prisoners are subjected to widespread abuses, including forced ideological re-education, extended solitary confinement and the denial of medical treatment for serious illnesses."" Cuba also enforces political conformity through beatings, short-term detention, public acts of repudiation and the denial of work, Human Rights Watch says. ""Taken together, these everyday forms of repression create a climate of fear that has a profound chilling effect on the exercise of fundamental freedoms in Cuban society,"" the report says. Human Rights Watch urges the United States to dismantle a trade embargo it has imposed on Cuba since 1962. The embargo, the group said, has proven a costly and misguided failure. ""The embargo has inflicted severe hardship on the Cuban population as a whole, while doing nothing to improve the human rights situation in Cuba,"" the rights group says. ""Rather than isolating Cuba, the policy has isolated the United States, alienating Washington's potential allies on this issue."" In place of the embargo, Human Rights Watch recommends that the United States obtain commitments from the European Union, Canada and Latin American allies to push Cuba to meet one demand: the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners within six months. ""If the Raul Castro government does not meet this demand,"" the rights group says, ""members of the multilateral coalition should impose targeted, punitive measures, such as travel bans on government officials or withholding new forms of foreign investment. These measures should be significant enough to bear real consequences for the Cuban government, while being careful not to impose suffering on the Cuban population as a whole."" The report came one day after the release of poll results by another group showing 82 percent of Cubans do not believe matters are going well on the island. In the survey, sponsored by the non-partisan International Republican Institute, 52 percent of Cubans who responded cited economic issues as their greatest concern and 66 percent said they do not believe the government will solve the nation's most pressing issues. ""The data reveals Cubans' strong dissatisfaction toward its leadership and their indisputable preferences for political and economic change,"" the institute's president, Lorne Craner, says in a news release. The poll, undertaken July 1-August 4 in 12 Cuban provinces, asked the opinions of 432 Cuban adults, the institute said. The results have a sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

"Washington (CNN) -- North Korea has completed the structures at a second missile launch site in the northwest part of the country, a U.S. official said Thursday. The admission comes on the same day that new satellite imagery, taken by GeoEye on January 10, was released showing a tower, a movable launch pad and swing arms, according to an analysis by Globalsecurity.org. ""The facility comprises a rocket engine test stand, missile assembly and test buildings, a launch bunker and an observation tower, making it a more advanced facility than its other North Korean counterpart at Musudan-ri,"" according to a Globalsecurity.org description of the image. But the official said it is not clear whether the technical components, the electronics, are in place that would allow for a launch from the site, which is near Tongchang-dong. In either case, the official said, there is no indication that the North Koreans plan a test launch in the near term. The intelligence community has been closely watching the site for some time. The official, who asked not to be named because the official was not authorized to speak on the issue, said the location of the facility allows North Korea to launch heavier payloads. The Defense Department would not comment on the new picture. ""We don't comment on press reports regarding intelligence matters. However, we continue to call on North Korea to fulfill its international obligations; cease provocative behaviors; and take steps to improve relations with its neighbors,"" said Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan . The nation previously announced it was working on developing the capacity to launch a space satellite. This site would allow them to do so but, the official cautioned, the site could also be used to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMS) which could pose a threat to the United States and other nations. ""It's a dual-use facility,"" said the official. ""The issue is intent."" The location of the facility also would allow North Korea to launch a payload at an angle that would avoid an flight over other nations. The head of U.S. military operations in Asia said that while he is not aware of any signs from North Korea of a near term missile test, he anticipated that the next likely provocation from North Korea could be in months, not years, due to a succession push. ""Due to the dynamics of North Korea with succession and the long history of this occurring, our concerns are that we're in a period of compressed time line for Kim Jong Il to train Kim Jong Un in these, in these coercive measures,"" Adm. Robert Willard, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, said Thursday in a speech to the Asia Society. ""Their continued development, export, proliferation of weapons will remain a regional challenge and an international challenge likely for some time to come...So this is a major concern of ours...it should concern us all."" In April 2009, North Korea attempted a test to launch what they said was a satellite into space from its other launch site near Musudan-ri, in the northeast. The missile flew over Japan before crashing into the sea. The launch was widely condemned.","NEW: Satellite imagery is released showing a tower and movable launch pad .

"(CNN) -- A 37-year-old white supremacist, Kevin William Harpham, was sentenced Tuesday to 32 years in prison for placing a bomb-laden backpack along the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Spokane, Washington, in January, the U.S. Justice Department said. Harpham, an unemployed electrician from Colville, Washington, pleaded guilty in September to charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to commit a federal hate crime. Shrapnel in the ""improvised explosive device"" contained anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting, authorities said. After he is released from prison, Harpham will serve the rest of his life under court supervision, federal prosecutors said. ""Harpham admitted that he is a white supremacist and white separatist, and that he placed the explosive device at the march with the intent to cause bodily injury to the person or persons in order to further his racist beliefs,"" a Justice Department statement said. Federal prosecutors had recommended that Harpham be sentenced to 32 years in prison, according to court documents. He was sentenced in federal court in Spokane. The January 17 march was attended by about 2,000 people, including racial minorities, authorities said. ""Today, Mr. Harpham faces the consequences of his hate-filled act. A prototypical 'lone wolf' such as Mr. Harpham presents a particularly vexing threat -- with nothing foreshadowing a carefully planned attack,"" Laura M. Laughlin, special agent in charge of the FBI Seattle office, said in a statement. Said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, in a statement: ""Acts of hate like this one have no place in our country in the year 2011, but yet, unfortunately, we continue to see attempted violence in our communities due to racial animus."" The backpack containing the device was discovered, and no one was injured. But law enforcement officials said that if Harpham had succeeded, many people could have been harmed. He had packed a 6-inch steel pipe with 100 grams of black powder and more than 100 fishing weights, which were intended to be shrapnel. In addition, Harpham coated the weights with an anticoagulant. According to court documents, he intended to set off his bomb using a transmitter and receiver from a remote car starter device. The plea agreement says Harpham's DNA was matched to the backpack; investigators tracked his purchase of the fishing weights to a local Walmart store and the purchase of the remote triggering mechanism to an Internet transaction; and they retrieved a camera from his home that contained pictures Harpham had taken of himself at the march.","NEW: Kevin William Harpham is prototypical ""lone wolf,"" FBI says .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two Iranian warships are expected to pass through the Suez Canal Wednesday night on their way to Syria, a move that Israel considers a ""provocation"" and that sent oil prices soaring. The passage, which Iran said was part of a training mission, is ""something which has not happened in many years,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said. ""This is a provocation that proves that the self-confidence and insolence of the Iranians is growing from day to day,"" he said. ""This happens after the Iranian president's visit to south Lebanon and his aggressive declarations there towards Israel."" The Israeli Defense Ministry said Israel was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies. Crude oil for delivery in March rose as much as 1.2% to $85.95 a barrel, following the news. Brent crude, which is traded primarily overseas in Europe, rose as much as 2.1% to $103.31 a barrel. Traders urged caution, saying the reports were still vague. ""The reports are sketchy at the moment, but the news of Iranian warships in the Suez did rally the market a bit,"" said Andrew Lebow, a commodities broker with MF Global. ""The market is looking for more information but certainly we're seeing some short covering on the reports."" The Suez Canal serves as a key passageway for international trade, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go all the way around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day on the way to both Europe and North America. Iranian Navy officials have said the flotilla has embarked on a yearlong training mission that takes it to the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. During the mission, Iranian Navy cadets are due to be trained and prepared for defending the country's cargo ships and oil tankers. Iranian Navy Cmdr. Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said cadets would be trained to protect ships and tankers now under threat of attack from Somali pirates, Fars said. Part of the mission was also to gather intelligence. Sayyari said the ships were in the region in ""pursuit of a powerful (military) presence in the high seas and to consolidate our friendly ties and declare our message of peace and friendship to the regional countries."" Liberman urged Israel's allies to pay attention. ""We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place,"" he said. Liberman's comments were not so much a threat but a wake-up call about a ""worrying development,"" said a senior government official who was not identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The official said Liberman was ""painting it as a challenge to the West."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamim Netanyahu's office offered no immediate comment.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Protesters marched and packed the main square of Mexico City on Sunday, slamming the candidate widely seen as the front-runner in next month's presidential elections. Enrique Peña Nieto, the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate, leads in polls. His party -- better known as the PRI -- ruled for some 70 years, before losing the presidency in 2000. Demonstrators say his winning would be a step back for democracy in Mexico. ""I'm here because I'm really angry with what's going on in my country. I think it's not fair,"" said Adrian Garcia, 34, a protester. He wore a white T-shirt with the words ""Yo Soy 132,"" (""I am 132"") printed on it, referencing a nascent protest group that Peña Nieto inadvertently helped to create. After students jeered the candidate at a recent campaign event, Peña Nieto dismissed the demonstrators as outsiders, dragged there by political operatives to cause commotion. Three days later, a YouTube video featured 131 students flashing their university ID cards, saying ""We are students from Ibero. ... Nobody forced us to do anything."" The 11-minute video went viral. Posts promoting protests throughout the country on social media have used it as a jumping off point, using the phrase ""#YoSoy132"" on Twitter and Facebook. But Sunday's protests in Mexico City attracted more than just students -- teachers, unions and various political groups were also there. The demonstrations were timed to coincide with the last scheduled televised debate before the presidential election, which is set for July 1. Similar, though smaller, rallies were held in several other Mexican cities. Garcia, the protester, said he voted for leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in the last election. Lopez Obrador never conceded after officials declared Felipe Calderon the winner of Mexico's election in 2006 and has been known to refer to himself as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" The former Mexico City mayor is running again. ""They are touching on a fundamental theme that has to do with the pretension of dominating the country through the almost absolute control of the media,"" Lopez Obrador said recently about the protesters. He and other opponents have accused Peña Nieto of receiving preferential treatment from the media since before the campaign began. The candidate, who was governor of the state of Mexico from 2005 to 2011, has denied those accusations and said he respects the youth protests against him.

"(CNN) -- U.S. troops lent ""limited technical support"" in France's bloody and unsuccessful bid in Somalia to rescue an intelligence agent who'd been held hostage for years, President Barack Obama said Sunday. Obama detailed the U.S. military involvement in the Friday night mission in a letter sent to the leaders of the nation's two legislative chambers. The letter was released publicly as well. Are you there? Send your photo, videos, but please stay safe. While U.S. forces ""provided limited technical support,"" they ""took no direct part in the assault on the compound where it was believed the French citizen was being held hostage,"" the president explained. In addition, U.S. military aircraft were available but were not used. ""United States combat aircraft briefly entered Somali airspace to support the rescue operation, if needed,"" the president wrote. ""These aircraft did not employ weapons during the operation."" Obama said he directed the U.S. troops' involvement in the operation ""in furtherance of U.S. national security interests, and pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as commander in chief and chief executive."" By 8 p.m., all U.S. forces were out of Somalia. The moves came after French forces engaged in a fierce gunbattle with militants in their attempt to rescue hostage Denis Allex, who was a member of the DGSE, France's equivalent of the CIA and a part of its defense ministry. The skirmish in Bulo Marer, about 75 miles northwest of the capital Mogadishu, ended with a French soldier and 17 Islamist fighters dead, according to the French Defense Ministry. Another French soldier is missing. French bid to rescue hostage fails . French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in Paris on Saturday that ""everything leads us to believe that Denis Allex was gunned down by his captors."" French President Francois Hollande, meanwhile, lamented the ""sacrifice"" of the two French soldiers and ""maybe the assassination"" of the hostage. But the al-Shabaab militia, which is affiliated with al Qaeda, claimed Allex is unharmed and being held in a new location. The group said in a statement that they'll decide the hostage's fate in the next two days. Allex was abducted on July 14, 2009, while on a mission in Mogadishu in support of the transitional Somali government, the French Defense Ministry said. French media reports suggest that Denis Allex is a pseudonym for the military serviceman. French officials said they launched the rescue attempt after the terror group failed to negotiate for the hostage's release for years while holding him in inhumane conditions. The U.S. military has been involved in Somalia before, notably in the ill-fated 1993 Battle of Mogadishu that ended with 18 American soldiers killed. U.S. forces were in Somalia to try to capture powerful Somali warlord Mohammed Aidid from his stronghold in the war-torn capital and take him to a ship anchored off the nearby coast. But by the end of the 16-hour battle in which commandos tried to seize several of Aidid's top lieutenants, 18 elite Army Rangers and hundreds of Somalis lay dead in the streets of Mogadishu. The movie inspired the best-selling book ""Black Hawk Down"" by Mark Bowden and an eponymous, Oscar Award-winning movie directed by Ridley Scott. Fourteen years later, the U.S. military re-emerged in Somalia by conducting airstrikes targeting al Qaeda-linked operatives in southern Somalia. Other strikes followed, including one in 2008 that killed an al-Shabaab leader and several other senior leaders of his group, according to local officials. CNN's Greg Botelho and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","President Obama details U.S. military involvement in a hostage rescue in Somalia .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- With a few taps of the hammer and some expertly placed glue, Elio Mendoza can extend the life of even the most well-worn shoes. Now, he hopes the Cuban government can do the same for the country's sagging economy when it holds the first Communist Party Congress in nearly 14 years, starting on Saturday. ""It's up to the Congress to improve things,"" Mendoza says as he replaces the heel on a pair of red flats. ""We need a new culture: If you work you get ahead. If you don't work, you lose."" Mendoza is part of a small, but growing class of micro-entrepreneurs, self-employed barbers, plumbers, taxi drivers and other artisans in a country where nearly 90 percent of the economy is still run by the state. A former steelworker, Mendoza says he wouldn't go back to working for the state. ""It's better than before,"" he says. ""Before it was, yes boss, no boss. Now I'm the boss."" President Raul Castro has begun the biggest shakeup of the Soviet-style economy in decades. The government plans to eliminate more than one million state jobs-- a full 20 percent of the workforce -- by 2015. At the same time, it has set down guidelines for the expansion of the private sector to soak up some of the unemployed, allowing Cubans to take out licenses for 178 different occupations. Since November, more than 170,000 people have bought licenses, most of them related to food preparation. High-end restaurants like El Carruaje offer imported cheese and wine and a gently gurgling fountain to attract tourists and big spenders. But most new establishments are modest affairs. Julia, who like several people interviewed for this story asked that her full name not be used, does a brisk business selling coffee and homemade éclairs at a stand in her driveway. ""It's a good place because we're across the street from the hospital,"" she says. ""It's all about location."" Clients also line up for pizza and pastries at a private stall next door, while the state-run fish restaurant down the street stands empty. ""The private places are better quality, better price and better service,"" says Victor, a construction worker. Even so, many of the newly self-employed have had to shut down within a couple of months, unable to pay state taxes. Economic reforms will be the focus of the Congress that kicks off on Saturday, with a military parade to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cuba's victory over the U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion. The summit will continue through Tuesday. Castro has to ease concerns about massive layoffs in the public sector and encourage alternatives once scorned. ""We need to change the negative perception that so many of us have for this kind of private work,"" he said during a speech in December. Castro insists the changes will not undermine Cuba's socialist system but help strengthen it. ""Either we rectify the situation or the time is up as we close in on the precipice,"" he said in the same speech. ""We will fall and along with us entire generations will fall."" He called for Cubans to debate the proposed changes openly. In the days ahead of the Congress, Cubans were doing just that. ""I'm not afraid to talk,"" said one man as he snacked on one of Julia's eclairs. ""For years, the government was the only one who didn't want these changes. But they had to, because they were up to their neck."" For the construction worker Victor, more changes are still needed. ""Cubans also need the freedom to buy and sell their own home, paying taxes to the government, of course,"" he said. A group of nurses standing outside the hospital said they also want to see improvements for the millions of Cubans like themselves who still do work for the state. ""Right now, I don't think the Congress is doing anything at all for people like us,"" one woman said.","Cuba's growing class of small-business owners sees promise in economic reforms .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban insurgents seized an Afghan pilot and nine foreign nationals from a transport helicopter after it was forced to make an emergency landing late Sunday night in eastern Afghanistan, authorities said. The private helicopter, that was used to carry food and other items for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), was headed to Kabul from a NATO base in Khost province when it was forced to land in Azra district in neighboring Logar province, said the district's governor, Hamidullah Hamid. On board were seven Turkish engineers and three pilots: an Afghan and two Russians. Because it's not always safe to travel by road in areas with heavy militant activity, engineers and others will often hitch rides in helicopters delivering supplies. Taliban storm Afghan police checkpoint; kill 6 . The aircraft landed in Logar because of equipment malfunction, said Din Mohammad Darwesh, the spokesman for the Logar province's governor. The Taliban immediately surrounded the chopper and took the nine occupants hostage. Local officials enlisted the help of tribal elders to secure their release, Darwesh said. The Taliban, in a text message to news outlets, said the group forced the helicopter down. John Manley, an ISAF spokesman, would only say that a civilian aircraft went down in eastern Afghanistan and that the alliance was ""assisting."" The Turkish foreign ministry said it could not confirm the involvement of the Taliban or whether several of its citizens had been taken hostage.

"(CNN Student News) -- May 10, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Mississippi River  • Japan • Normal, Illinois . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hello, everyone! This Tuesday on CNN Student News, we're taking you under the big top. First, though, we're headed down the mighty Mississippi. First Up: Flood Waters Rising . AZUZ: That would be the Mississippi River, which is causing floods up and down its path through the United States. Want to take you down the river now to check out some of what's been going on. We're gonna start in southern Illinois, in the city of Cairo. You see it right there on your screen. Flooding was threatening to wipe out the entire town. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers came up with this plan to help Cairo and some other communities nearby. And that brings us down into Missouri. What the Corps did was intentionally blow up a levee, a barrier that's designed to actually prevent flooding. That helped the towns up in Illinois, but it purposely flooded some parts of Missouri, some farms. And a lot of people, especially farmers, angry with this plan. One farmer said she felt like she was suffering for somebody else. The flooding has followed the Mississippi's path through Arkansas and down into Louisiana, as you see here. Yesterday, engineers opened a spillway north of the city of New Orleans. The goal here is to help ease the pressure on the river, hopefully lower the flood levels, keep the water away from New Orleans. But just to get an idea of how much water we're talking about, a commander with the Army Corps of Engineers offered an analogy. He said the water that's rushing through the Mississippi right now, in one second, could fill up an area the size of a football field 44 feet deep. We're also seeing flooding in states that the Mississippi branches off to, like Tennessee. Holly Firfer has more on the situation there. (BEGIN VIDEO) HOLLY FIRFER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Tennessee's largest city is in the cross hairs. Memphis now has the ""most high-risk population"" for flooding, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. On Tuesday, authorities expect the Mississippi to crest at 48 feet outside the city, less than a foot shy of the record level set in 1937. With the Mississippi swollen by a month of abnormally high rainfall, its tributaries are overflowing, with nowhere for their water to flow. At least 1,100 homes and trailers in and around Memphis have been evacuated. 400 residents of Shelby County are currently in shelters. On Sunday, officials went door to door to alert others that they may also need to leave their homes. The mayor of Memphis is confident that all those who need to escape the rising waters will be evacuated. MAYOR AC WHARTON, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE: We'll get them out. Some are holding out to the last minute, but we think in the end they're going to come on out. FIRFER: Officials say while there is great pressure on the levees around Memphis, they are currently performing as expected. (END VIDEO) Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The United States and China have the world's largest economies. Legit! That means these countries have a lot of influence when it comes to global finances. Economic Talks . AZUZ: Well, the global economy is one of the big issues ahead as representatives from the U.S. and China meet in Washington this week. This is the third set of meetings between the two governments. Last week, one Chinese economic official said, ""To be frank, we have different views that make discussion necessary."" Some of those different views have to do with the economic policies of the U.S. and China. Since they're the world's biggest economies, what each country does -- its economic practices, the decisions it makes -- can have a pretty big impact on the other nation. Some other subjects are likely to come up during the meetings. That includes human rights, concerns about North Korea's nuclear program, and the U.S. and China working together to fight terrorism. Reactors . AZUZ: Moving to Japan, where officials are shutting down a nuclear power plant. Not the Fukushima Daiichi plant, the one we've talked about since Japan's earthquake and tsunami in March. No, the one we're talking about today is the Hamaoka plant. The owner announced it's being shut down after Japan's prime minister warned that Hamaoka was vulnerable to natural disasters, like the ones that damaged the Fukushima plant. Hamaoka's owner says safety is his company's first priority. Meanwhile, workers went back inside one of the reactors at the Fukushima plant yesterday. They were checking on a ventilation system that was installed last week. The system is filtering out radioactive substances so that engineers can go in and shut down the reactor. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Miss Abromitis' class at the Sarah Rawson Smith School in Atlanta, Georgia! What is the scientific name for a fear of heights? Here we go! Is it: A) Agoraphobia, B) Aurophobia, C) Acrophobia or D) Arachnophobia? You've got three seconds -- GO! Fear of heights is acrophobia, from the root word acro, which means height. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Gamma Phi Circus . AZUZ: That's also where we get the word acrobat, like tightrope walkers and trapeze artists; the kind of folks you'd see in a circus. Ted Rowlands visited a school in Illinois where students can train to be part of the show. It's not clown college. It's a regular university where the person sitting next to you in Chemistry 101 could be double-majoring in Circus Studies. (BEGIN VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is our identity going to become more external than it has been internal? TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sarah Bowden is a sophomore at Illinois State University. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Boys and girls, children of all ages. ROWLANDS: She is also a circus performer. Sarah is part of Illinois State's Gamma Phi Circus, a school-sponsored circus team that dates back to 1929. It's the oldest of two college circus programs in the country; the other is at Florida State. SARAH BOWDEN, CIRCUS PERFORMER, ILLINOIS STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENT: So, this is the basic way to get up into the lyric hoop. ROWLANDS: Sarah was a gymnast in high school, but like most of her teammates had no circus experience. What do your parents think of all this? BOWDEN: My parents are really supportive. You know, the minute I joined the circus, they're like, ""What, you joined the circus?"" MARCUS ALOUAN, CIRCUS DIRECTOR, ILLINOIS STATE UNIVERSITY: I think any one of us who has ever come through Gamma Phi Circus has had that conversation with their parents where they're trying to explain that it's still a part of the university, but it's something in addition to going to classes. ROWLANDS: Marcus Alouan, a former student at Illinois State and circus performer, is now the director of the circus program. ALOUAN: For the most part, we look for somebody who's strong, hardworking and coachable. ROWLANDS: And doesn't have a fear of heights? ALOUAN: That certainly helps. Although, actually, we have a lot of people who seek us out because they want to overcome that. ROWLANDS: Senior Nena Woo, who broke her arm in a trapeze fall, says after graduating, she wants to join a professional circus. NENA WOO, CIRCUS PERFORMER, ILLINOIS STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENT: I'm graduating with a degree in public relations. If I can do that with a circus company or somewhere in entertainment, I'd love to do that. ROWLANDS: The circus team has about 75 members. They don't compete, but they do perform every spring. Dating back more than 80 years, Gamma Phi Circus puts on a series of shows at the university. This was Sarah's first performance. BOWDEN: Not in a million years did I think I'd be in a circus. So, I am so happy that I did it, though. ROWLANDS: Ted Rowlands, CNN, Normal, Illinois. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: A school without grade levels: We talked about this last Wednesday.

Avery is home schooled, but thinks students shouldn't be grouped by age but by knowledge. ""Some students in a class grouped by age may be behind or ahead and thus ignored."" Clive says it could be a good idea. ""Teachers won't have to worry about leaving students behind who struggle or giving students who are ahead lessons on what they already know."" From Meg: ""A big part of school is the social part. All kids deserve to be with kids who are going through the same things."" Celeste writes, ""students who usually get caught behind will have a better chance to truly learn the material rather than sit in a class they don't understand."" But Alex argues, ""It could make kids feel like they aren't as smart as their classmates, which would degrade their work. Some might get picked on because they aren't at the same level.""

"(CNN) -- I am the mother of three amazing children. Before having children, I was a firm believer that guns were dangerous. But I did nothing to educate myself about guns or gun safety. I feared the unknown and the danger guns seemed to possess. But after 10 years, I now have a gun in my home. Listening to President Obama's news conference on Thursday marking 100 days after Sandy Hook, and the whole gun control debate, prompted me to get my viewpoint across. I married a U.S. Marine. He of course was a firm believer in his right to bear arms. This posed no issue until our son was born. I was adamant that no gun be allowed in our home, while he felt quite the opposite. We agreed on one gun locked in a safe, and his other hunting guns were stored at his parents.' Slowly over the years, I became more and more fearful of being home alone on the nights he worked, especially after I had children. We were living in Maryland on a farm in the middle of nowhere. One night, I got a call from my husband telling me to lock all doors and windows as he had just spoken with a sheriff down the road who was looking for an escaped convict. I was terrified. We had that one gun, but I had no idea how to use it. That changed very quickly over the following weeks, as we went out for target practice. I learned how to shoot and for the first time in years, I slept well. I finally felt safe at night. Over the 11 years of our marriage, I slowly learned about guns. I began to accept that the gun itself posed no danger -- any danger was in the hand and heart of the beholder. I learned there were safe ways to teach your children about guns. Guns were a tool like any tool; they have multiple purposes and uses. I learned more about our Constitution and our rights as U. S. citizens. I learned I had nothing to fear and a lot to gain from owning a gun. Why would someone own a military-style rifle? I think mothers need to educate themselves and learn how to best educate their kids. I work with a lot of other mothers, and many of them are shocked that I was taught how to shoot. I understand because I was there at one point -- I was scared of guns. But I no longer fear them. Marine to senator: I won't 'register my weapons' So Mr. Obama and your gun control advocates: I am not physically capable of stopping a 200-pound man from raping me or my daughters. I am not physically capable of stopping a 200-pound man from entering my home and doing what he may. However, my gun is very capable of stopping such a criminal if such an act were to occur. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . We live in a society where no one is there to protect us. The police come after the crime, not before. I do not have 24/7 armed protection like you do, Mr. President. Neither do my children. So until you can explain to this nation why your old city of Chicago has rising murder rates by guns, despite some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, I will continue to support the NRA, I will continue to urge others to support the Second Amendment and I will continue to vote for those politicians that support my views. I will also support the notion of placing armed police, veterans, etc. in our schools. Why should your children, Mr. President, be of the select few children in this country who are protected by armed guards? Why are your children more special than mine? Guns on campus: NRA to announce school safety measures . The fact is they are not. All children are special and have the right to be cared for and protected. I am a mom, and I am proud to support the NRA and my right to bear arms.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Products like Ruffles, Doritos and Cheetos may be among the latest targets of cartel violence in Mexico. Authorities said armed attackers over the weekend set ablaze warehouses and delivery trucks for Sabritas, a subsidiary of PepsiCo that distributes many of the company's snack foods in Mexico. Five of the company's distribution centers were attacked in the states of Guanajuato and Michoacan, officials said. Sabritas has not provided details about the damage, but Mexico's state-run Notimex agency said the attacks caused ""serious material losses."" No one was injured or killed, authorities said. On Monday, authorities arrested four suspects who they said were members of the Knights Templar, a cartel that officials have accused of extorting business owners, decapitating and dismembering kidnapping victims and setting vehicles ablaze to block roads during shootouts with police. The suspects in this month's attacks face charges of aggravated arson, but federal authorities are investigating them for connections with organized crime, Guanajuato state prosecutors said. To prevent further attacks, state authorities were guarding 10 of the company's warehouses on Tuesday in Michoacan, a Knights Templar stronghold, Notimex reported. Sabritas said it was working with authorities to investigate the attacks. ""The company is taking all the necessary measure to re-establish the operation as soon as possible (in the affected distribution centers). Sabritas reiterates that its priority will always be the safety of all its collaborators,"" the company said Monday. Word of the attacks quickly spread in Mexico's business community, with the leader of at least one industry group saying seeing such a large company fall victim to violence could discourage others from investing in the country. Already, amid widespread threats and extortion, many companies are devoting an increasing portion of their budgets to security, Sergio Cervantes Rodiles, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industries, told Notimex. The head of another national business group condemned the attacks Tuesday and called on authorities to punish the perpetrators. ""The hurting or threatening of companies, which are the principal generators of wealth and jobs in Mexico, must not be allowed under any circumstances,"" Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce President Jorge Davila Flores said in a statement. Analysts have argued that Mexico's economy is thriving, despite widespread violence in a drug war that has claimed more than 47,500 lives since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. Gun and bomb attack on hotel in Mexican border town wounds 10 . Speaking at a regional security conference in Cancun on Monday, Calderon said that organized crime was a threat to democracy and economic growth. ""Organized crime is also a threat to growth and development, and an obstacle for prosperity. It attacks companies and businesses, big and small storekeepers, and with that infringes on the urgent need to generate jobs and employment for our people,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- I recently saw video of an interview I'd done a couple years ago, when I was ginormously pregnant. Next to Annie Lennox, I was nine months along, with body parts bloated beyond recognition and heading in directions they normally don't. My breasts were falling to the sides -- why had someone not told me to wear a more effective push-up bra? -- my face was all puffy. I swear, I counted one, two -- no, three -- chins below my overly smoky eye shadow. And then there was the belly -- a massive dome of a thing, so immense that Lennox looked like a wee Scottish lass beside me. Jessica-Simpson-on-the-cover-of-Elle, no. Sexy, I was not. But then I remembered an odd event that occurred hours after that encounter with Lennox, long after the eye shadow was wiped off. I was in a grocery store checking out avocados when a man approached. He was probably in his early 40s, clean-shaven, dressed in a sharp gray suit. ""Congratulations!"" he said, beaming. ""How far along are you?"" ""Oh, I'm due in three weeks,"" I replied. ""You must be excited,"" he said. I didn't tell him that excitement doesn't really register when it takes a forklift and three bodybuilders to raise you out of bed in the morning. ""Is it your first?"" ""Mmm hmm."" Ordinarily an exchange like this would wrap up at that point, especially since I'd found the perfect avocado and was ready to continue shopping. However, my curious new friend refused to budge. He had more questions. Boy or girl? Feeling good? I wasn't sure whether to start lobbing bell peppers and radishes at the guy, or just accept the chatter as that kindness from strangers only pregnancy evokes. My instincts told me there was more to it and when pregnant, your instincts are pretty darn noisy. There was something behind his charming smile, his lingering and the urgent look in his eyes. This dude thought I was hot. But how could he? I mean, I looked like an upright hippopotamus. Was he merely homing in on the obviousness of my fertility? Did he have a thing for maternity jeans? How is it possible that when your pregnant self feels your stretched-out worst, you're able to attract random-dude-in-Tom-Ford in the fruit and veggie aisle? But sex educator Logan Levkoff says during pregnancy, it's possible for women to be at their absolute best, and for others to see that, too. ""There is something about being pregnant that gives you this sense of confidence being in your own skin,"" she says. ""The idea of having to exercise until you're blue in the face and be stick skinny and fit into the tiny little things, you kind of think 'This is not that time.' And there is something about owning that and owning your body ... and people pick up on that."" Levkoff, who wrote the book ""How To Get Your Wife To Have Sex With You,"" also points out that a voracious appetite for food when eating for two translates to an appetite for other things -- life in general and, of course, sex. It's no secret that the surge of pregnancy hormones can get a knocked up gal very worked up. I've heard husbands say that sex with their pregnant wives is the best they'd ever had. But that's within a committed relationship. I was taken aback when one of my single guy friends once told me having sex with a pregnant woman was high up on his bucket list. What, like climbing Everest and going fly-fishing naked? What's that about? I decided to ask my friend Marco Contini. He's a father of three, and Italian -- he tends to be very up-front about sexual matters. To my surprise, he admitted that he finds pregnant women attractive. And it all starts with ""the glow."" ""As banal as it may seem, it does have something to do with the light,"" he says. ""Among other nonpregnant ladies, a pregnant woman does shine. Which, if you think about it, is technically absurd, since often enough the glow comes along with visible signs of fatigue and pimples."" And kankles. And stretch marks. And spatula-flinging outbursts of rage. ""Another more obvious aspect is the boobs,"" Marco said. ""But that only applies to women one already knows well enough to notice the change."" Yeah, yeah. The boobs. Breasts get bigger during pregnancy, transforming even the smallest-chested woman into Sofia Vergara. But it was this next comment from Marco that really got me thinking: ""A pregnant woman always brings out an odd mix of physical attraction and desire to be protective."" Protective. Even when the woman is not carrying his child? Could there be some kind of biological spell at work here? Maybe, says neuropsychiatrist Dr. Louann Brizendine, author of ""The Female Brain"" and ""The Male Brain."" Brizendine says pheromones given off by a pregnant woman are known to suppress the testosterone levels in her male partner and increase his production of the hormone prolactin. These changes might play a role in forming ""daddy brain,"" a state that keeps the father rooted to the mother so he'll help care for her and the baby after the birth. Perhaps, Brizendine suggests, there was something ""pheromonal"" going on while I was in the grocery store that day. (She notes, though, there's no evidence that pheromones could work so quickly on humans in such a situation.) Let's go back to the visuals for a minute, since after all, pregnancy is an astonishingly visual adventure. Brizendine says men are wired to scan for the telltale signs that a woman is fertile -- an hourglass figure, breasts and a flat abdomen signaling that she hasn't been impregnated by someone else. Why then are some men sexually attracted to women with a distinctly un-flat abdomen? ""When you're very pregnant there is this undeniable evidence you have had sex with a man,"" Brizendine says. ""And that can be titillating. It's like wearing a billboard sign on your body: ""I! Had! Sex!"" What else a pregnant belly might advertise: I'm! Safe! ""The male may feel maybe he can flirt with her in some way and have her not take it the wrong way,"" Brizendine says. ""Or because she's already pregnant [he doesn't] have to worry about contraception. These things may not all be conscious in the male who's leering at you but they may be percolating in the back of his brain somewhere, that you're a safe target."" I know. Pregnant women reading this are cringing. It is a bit ""Ewwww."" Sex with your baby daddy, least of all a stranger, might be the last thing on your mind right now, especially if you've been constipated for eight days and have an overactive bladder. So we can't forget, there's also the fetish angle. An abundance of pregnancy porn online proves there's a contingent of the population with a desire for pregnant women that goes beyond mere curiosity. (We should remind ourselves that fetishes exist for all kinds of things -- feet, ponytails, penguins; you name it). Brizendine says some of her patients do express an erotic interest in very pregnant females. A study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2011 suggests there's a link between sexual attraction to pregnancy and exposure to pregnancy and lactation in early childhood. The study found that a preference for pregnant or breastfeeding women was more common in individuals who had younger siblings; exposure to a pregnant mother between 18 months and 5 years might leave an imprint that manifests in adulthood. Fascinating, yes. But let's cast aside studies and evolutionary biology and odd bucket lists for a second. We might really gain something useful from all this if we home in on Levkoff's idea that a woman has the ability to eschew her usual hang-ups about her body during pregnancy. I remember that feeling. That let-it-all-hang-out easiness. In spite of the heft, I almost felt weightless when I was pregnant. We are so down on ourselves about our bodies so much of the time and pregnancy shields you from that nonsense (if you let it.) I ate peanut M&Ms by the truckload, loved my shapeliness, celebrated the life growing within me by smiling more and stood straighter than ever before -- though it might've been good posture that prevented me from toppling over. ""To be this kind of curvaceous superwoman (while pregnant) is something that we probably don't tap into enough,"" Levkoff says. ""And if we could find a way to balance some of those feelings, that confidence in our everyday life, I think we'd all probably be a bit better off."" Toward the end of my interview with Annie Lennox in 2010, she looked directly at my mountainous belly and said in her delightful Scottish brogue: ""I don't think I've ever been interviewed by anyone quite so pregnant!"" I was tickled pink that a pop veteran like Lennox would acknowledge my determination to keep working even though I was so far into my third trimester, when the pounds and discomfort come fast and furious. Clearly I didn't mind baring it all for CNN's cameras. Part of me really misses that brazen broad with all her breadth. I'll think of her next time I'm pinching avocados in the supermarket, and perhaps pinch myself to stand a little straighter, smile a little more and wink at no one in particular.","CNN's Shanon Cook remembers men flirting with her while she was pregnant .
