"Confused: Justine McNally arrives at Wood Green Court Court today having admitted posing as a boy to get a teenage girl into bed . A schoolgirl who posed as a 'goth' boy called Scott for three-and-a-half years just to get another teenage girl into bed has been jailed for three years today. Justine McNally, 18, duped her 16-year-old victim into believing she was male as they chatted online and carried on tricking her after they met by strapping a sex toy to her waist. Glaswegian McNally, then 17, lured the London schoolgirl into three sex sessions, promising her they would get married and have children. The girl was even fooled into thinking she had lost her virginity to McNally in a darkened bedroom of a family friend's house. McNally's secret was only exposed as a young woman when a friend of her mother found a sex toy in her backpack. She was sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court today after admitting six counts of sexual assault by penetration. 'Because of the abuse of trust, the trauma to the victim, and the peculiar circumstances, this is an extraordinary case', said prosecutor David Markham. 'This case is about the defendant, then aged 17, sexually assaulting the victim, then aged 16, by deceiving her into believing that she, the defendant, was a boy. 'She obtained consent to physical intimacy between them by fraud. The case involves a very serious abuse of trust.' McNally was jailed today by Judge James Patrick for the 'selfish and callous' deception. She and her victim started their relationship when aged 12 and 13 after meeting through an online videogame. During their three-and-a-half-year time together the girls 'spoke about what they wanted to do to each other' sexually, said Mr Markham. 'Scott (McNally) spoke about what he wanted to do with his d***'. They eventually met in March 2011, when McNally came to visit the girl in north London, staying with a friend of the family. They had talked about having sex during online webchats on MSN and on video calls, and the relationship turned physical on the first visit. But McNally refused to remove her clothes while sexually touching the girl, the court was told. '(The victim) offered to perform oral sex on him and went to touch his penis, but Scott said he didn't want her to do that and he was happy to pleasure her', said Mr Markham. 'So she did not touch his penis at any point.' He said at the first of three encounters, in March, May, and August 2011, the two girls tried to have sex. 'She (the victim) believed intercourse was being attempted, Scott had said he wanted her to lose her virginity to him and she was trying to make him happy', said Mr Markham. 'But she suffered a lot of pain and they settled for cuddling up together.' The teenager was tearful throughout the sentencing hearing today as she was told prison was the only option for her crime because of the damage to the victim. 'She had her first sexual experience with you, and you abused her trust so badly she finds it difficult to trust other people', said Judge Patrick. 'I was selfish and callous behaviour - a grave abuse of trust of her, her family and friends through your behaviour over a period of years.' The judge said her disguise as a Goth called Scott fooled everybody when she came to visit the girl in London, making trips to Camden and a fireworks night in Enfield. 'They met you with good faith and welcomed you into their homes', he said. The court heard the girl had gone out to buy condoms ahead of sex sessions with 'Scott', and fully anticipated they would have sexual contact. 'You put your feelings before those of anyone else', said Judge Patrick. 'You have had a troubled history, but without wishing to minimise the effect of that on you, it's no more remarkable. 'You found the process of puberty complicated and had problems coming to terms with your sexuality.' Judge Patrick said she would spend half her three year prison sentence behind bars before being released on licence. 'Clearly you didn't appreciate the seriousness of what you were doing', he added. 'You are an upset, distressed young woman, but the offence is so serious that a custodial sentence must follow.' Case: Wood Green Crown Court (pictured) heard McNally had used a sex toy to bamboozle her teenage victim . McNally, supported by her father in court, will be on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and is banned from contact the victim or her mother. Last year the girls had broken off their separate individual relationships and believed they were girlfriend and boyfriend, making plans to start a life together, the court heard. Hollywood: Hilary Swank won an Oscar in 2000 for playing a teenager who pretended to be a boy, but was a girl, in the film Boys Don't Cry . 'They talked about getting married and having children in the future', said Mr Markham. When McNally tried to break off a previous relationship with a girlfriend in Glasgow, her cover was nearly blown when the victim and the girlfriend got into a furious row. 'That girlfriend made a comment about Scott being a girl', said prosecutor Mr Markham. 'When this was put to the defendant, the defendant laughed it off and joked about it. The way Scott dismissed it reassured her that everything was fine.' McNally's secret was finally exposed in November 2011, when the family friend she was staying with got suspicious and looked through her possessions while on the phone to the girl's mother. 'The friend found a bra, a size 12 River Island top, and as she was talking, she found a strap on penis in the bag', said Mr Markham. Later in the evening, after dropping McNally off at the friend's house near Tottenham Hale train station, the mother said to her daughter: 'You do know Scott is a actually a girl? 'The victim entered a state of shock and denial, didn't know what to think or what to do', said Mr Markham. The mother and daughter then confronted McNally, who produced a picture on Facebook of her dressed in pink clothing and heels, and said she wanted to have a sex change to continue the relationship. Mr Markham said the victim was 'literally sickened' by the revelations, and eventually ended the relationship and called police. She told the court she now struggles to build relationships with friends and boyfriends, preferring to isolate herself. 'The sense of violation and vulnerability engendered by this crime left her with feelings of confusion and bewilderment', said Mr Markham. 'What should be an exciting era in her life has been darkened by what has been done to her. 'She feels completely bereft and besieged with self-doubt.' Defence barrister Keith Thomas said her deception should be seen as a situation that got out of hand rather than grooming. 'It got out of hand, particularly if you accept this didn't start as a deliberate grooming offence', said Mr Thomas. 'It's almost a rollercoaster ride, obvious they didn't meet for some considerable period of time.' Mr Thomas said McNally, the youngest of four children, had suffered the divorce of her parents and was 'confused' about her gender issues. 'She had an unhappy upbringing which was confusing', he said. 'She found it more difficult than others to cope with the problems, within something of a dysfunctional family.' McNally has admitted the deception was wrong, but continues to insist she did not know it was criminal at the time. 'This is a peculiar, extraordinary case - a one-off', said Mr Thomas. 'It is clear she needs help. 'This was happening to an unhappy and distressed female, at a time when any female can go through a confusing and distressing period, whatever their upbringing.'","Justine McNally, 18, was jailed for three years today for her deception .

"They're a horrid pest that's been spreading across that country since the 1930s, with more than 200 million believed to be on the ground destroying native species and damaging the environment. But could the struggle to control them be as easy as getting the creatures on our menus? Professor Phillip Hayward from the Southern Cross University thinks so, and says the toads are actually a really good source of protein. Prof Hayward is doing his latest research of how we can eat these 'ghastly evasives', as he describes them, and says a regulated industry in Australia would not just provide an economic benefit but also health benefits. Scroll down for video . Could we eat this guy? Apparently so. A Sydney researcher says eating the pest and exporting them is a way of the future . 'Cane Toads are a good source of export product, there are huge interest from countries like China to export them, it could be a tangible export product.' He said currently many parts of East Asia and France eat frogs and numbers are starting to dwindle so an export industry in cane toads would be vastly beneficial for Australia, because we has so many. The toads are also in high demand in some countries where they extract the poison to be used in medical procedures. INGREDIENTS . * 8 Toad legs with skin removed . * 2 tablespoons of butter . * 3 cloves of garlic . * Chives . * Salt and pepper to taste . METHOD . Melt butter in a heavy based sauce pan and fry garlic until soft. Add toad legs and cook in butter until tender. Lightly toast a baguette. Serve two toad legs on a piece of baguette, drizzled with garlic butter and garnished with chives. 'Internationally China have started to show interest because they were unaware we have a massive supply market of them.' And as far as eating them goes, it's a no brainer. 'It is a food source that you don't have to farm because of the masses in Australia and it's increasing, the source is already made,' said Prof Hayward. 'The fact is they're threatening our species and we know that mobilising people to kill them doesn't work in the short term.' There are more than 200 million Cane Toads populating Australia and that number is increasing rapidly . Prof Hayward who has eaten his fair share of frogs legs in Asia believes eating Cane Toads is the way to go and will present his case to Australian cuisine at a regional food conference in Byron Bay later this month. Professor Phillip Hayward says we need to start exporting Cane Toads as products and eating them . 'Like any other frog meat, it's a bland meat but it is healthy with a good source of omega 3 and picks up marinade well.' He particularly likes a nice stir fried Cane Toad and admits it goes best with sesame oil and ginger. '30 to 40 years ago, we never thought we'd be eating raw fish in large quantities in Australia but now we do, we just need cultural attitudes to change and we can get it into a niche market.' 'To get it into the commercial market we need to look at the viability and how we can prepare it to not get poisoned, practises need to be right and then we can start,' he said. 'But it really is quite easy to get poison out of Cane Toads.' 'You simply have to kill them quickly as to not stress them out and remove their legs and skin and wash them.' 'The poor Cane Toad has an image problem, the poison is only in the shoulder area the legs are fine.' And while he doesn't see the idea of eating Cane Toads in Australia becoming a massively popular craze, he believes we need to embrace it. 'It really is a dream product, it's a winner on every front.' A group in the Northern Territory called GULP NT - which stands for growing and understanding local produce have promoted cooking up and eating Cane Toads. On their blog, they said friends of the organisation which live outside Darwin have always been keen on experimenting with the cooking of road kill, including snakes and wallabies and also had an interest in the use of these ugly toads as food. INGREDIENTS . * 8 toad legs with skins removed . * 4-5 knuckles of galangal . * Finley chopped 3 leaves of Thai coriander . * Finely chopped 2 large handfuls of kang kung . * 1 teaspoon sesame seed oil . * Splash of soy sauce Salt . * Salt and pepper . METHOD . Heat sesame seed oil in a wok on a medium heat. Fry toad legs for a couple minutes, add galangal and coriander, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes stirring continuously. Add kang kung and mix with plash of soy sauce until stems cooked. They included several recipes which have been tired and tested by the GULP team including Cane Toad marinated in soy, ginger, garlic and chilli. How about a salad of toad legs with Kang Kung and Galangal and canapes with garlic butter? They also suggested the most humane way to catch them was by the back legs and whip them into a dark airtight canoe bag and then freeze them. GULP says you don't want to stress them out so just pop them in the freezer and when you want to cook them, thaw them out and take a meat clever to chop off their legs.

"The two doctors missing for two days in the Blue Mountains have been found safe and well by search teams. Bupa Australia’s Chief Medical Officer and Medical Director both failed to return home from a bush walk  on Saturday night. Dr Paul Bates was last seen on Saturday morning . NSW Police said the men were discovered by an SES team in a canyon on Monday morning. 'About 10am today, an SES search team made voice contact with the two men in an area in the vicinity of Du Faurs Creek,' police said. 'It’s expected to take approximately half an hour to reach the men, due to the dense bushland in the surrounding area,' they added. Dr Paul Bates, 58 of Mosman, and Chris Dalton, 57, of Chatswood, were last seen at 6.30am on Saturday as they embarked on a day trip bush walk at Mount Wilson in Sydney's Blue Mountains. Bupa Australia’s spokesperson Brooke Lord told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are hugely concerned by the news that they didn't return from their hike. Our thoughts are with both Paul and Chris's family and friends.’ Mrs Lord said she knew both men personally and that 'they are both very active men and fit, healthy, outdoorsy types’. ‘My hopes and the whole business’s hopes are they are found safe and well today,' she added. Police found their car parked in a dirt car park next to the Mount Wilson fire shed. Blue Mountains rescue police said: ‘A canyoning group failed to return from a trip yesterday. Chris Dalton, 57, has been described as an active and outdoorsy man . ‘The two men from Sydney intended on doing a canyon in Bell Creek and were expecting to return yesterday afternoon. The group left details of their intended trip with family members.’ Blue Mountains Police, POLAIR, Police Rescue and NSW Ambulance Special Operations originally searched the bushland near where their car was located. The search for the men resumed at 8am on Monday morning. On Bupa’s website Dr Bates is described as a ‘passionate healthcare advocate’. Before joining Bupa he was the National Medical Director for Innovations at OptumHealth, one of the USA's largest health companies. Meanwhile, his friend Mr Dalton worked as an ear, nose and throat surgeon at The Sydney Children’s Hospital in Randwick for 17 years before joining Serco and then Bupa. The men went for a walk at Mount Wilson on Saturday, in the Blue Mountains .","Dr Paul Bates and Chris Dalton were last seen on Saturday morning .

To ensure she captured the perfect picture, Ms Wallace from Vancouver lay out on the ground metres away from the squirrel and slowly crawled towards him . The term is most often used to describe medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots or prairie dogs. Smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks. Together, they make up the 'marmot tribe' of squirrels, also known as the Marmotin. They are variable in size, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand comfortably for prolonged periods. Columbian ground squirrels live in colonies and females usually stay with the group they were born into, whereas males will leave their birth colony. They hibernate seven or eight months out of the year and create a special hibernation chamber in its burrow that is sealed off from the rest of the burrow with a plug of dirt.

"A former MI6 spy is being investigated by police on suspicion of defrauding a woman involved in one of the most costly and toxic divorce cases in British legal history. Michelle Young, 50, fought her ex-husband Scot, for eight years through 65 separate court hearings, at a cost to her of £6.5million, to try and secure a share of his fortune which she claimed exceeded £770million. Mr Young, a former property and telecoms tycoon, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle with his former wife but said he lost his entire fortune in a disastrous property deal that left him £28million in debt. At the conclusion of Michelle and Scot Young's marathon divorce case, she was awarded £20m . Michelle Young fought her ex-husband Scot, for eight years through 65 separate court hearings, at a cost to her of £6.5million, to try and secure a share of his fortune which she claimed exceeded £770million . The couple once socialised in a super-wealthy league that included Sir Philip Green, Simon Cowell and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. As their relationship was played out in court it was claimed Mr Young spent up to £5,000 a night eating out, that they went to a Raymond Blanc restaurant twice a week, that Mr Young paid up to £4million for 'a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat' and she had jewellery which Mr Young said cost a million pounds. It was also said that they went on three to four foreign holidays a year, staying in villas and presidential suites. The couple enjoyed a luxury lifestyle - pictured here on a runway in Barbados after their flight on Concorde . The couple were married in 1995 but it resulted in one of the most toxic and bitter divorces battles . But the tycoon's empire went into meltdown and he was declared bankrupt in 2010 and last year, after repeatedly refusing to produce financial documents, was jailed for six months for contempt of court. Ms Young maintains that he has squirrelled his assets offshore. In the end, the judge, Mr Justice Moor, agreed with her that 'he is not a penniless man of straw'. He decreed that Scot had a net fortune of £40 million and should therefore give Ms Young £20million. However one year on, she has yet to receive a penny and continues to fight for it. As such, she was forced to draw on the help of outside agencies to enforce her judgement order. Ms Young has yet to receive any of the money she was awarded and so paid £14,000 for information on her ex husband from Mark-Hill Wood, who worked for 25 years for GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service . Scot Young, a property and telecoms tycoon, pictured with his model and TV presenter girlfriend Noelle Reno . She was contacted in July by Mark Hill-Wood, who worked for 25 years for GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service before setting up his own private detective agency, Full-Proof Intelligence. His LinkedIn page describes him as a 'highly respected operative who formerly worked in the Intelligence Services' and he specialises in cyber investigations, firearms training and 'suspect interrogation.' According to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Hill-Wood told Ms Young that he had come across some of her former husband's hidden wealth in a Swiss bank account while working on an assignment in Russia. He therefore persuaded Ms Young to pay him £14,000 for the information, which she managed to raise through one of her previous litigation funders. Ms Young - who says she cannot work because running her legal case is a full-time job - is currently surviving on benefits to support her two daughters, Scarlet and Sasha. At one point Ms Young begged Mr Hill-Wood to hand over the information he claimed to have regarding her ex husband's hidden wealth in a Swiss bank account, saying 'I feel like crying, I'm under so much pressure' Mr Hill-Wood, who attended Marlborough College and Oxford University, said he would travel to Russia himself to recover the documentary evidence. However, suspicions were raised when another employee of FullProof Intelligence emailed Ms Young to say Mr Hill-Wood had been captured by the Russian authorities who were going to hold him until another £15,000 was raised. Ms Young refused and Mr Hill-Wood eventually emailed to say he had been released. By the end of July, Mr Hill-Wood claimed he had returned to the UK with 'two lever-arch files' of material that supposedly detailed Mr Young's offshore wealth. However he repeatedly cancelled meetings with her and her QC where he was supposed to hand it over. At one point, Ms Young emailed, begging him to hand it over, saying: 'I feel like crying, I'm under so much pressure.' However, the information never materialised and eventually Ms Young reported Mr Hill-Wood to the police. A senior Surrey Police source confirmed an investigation into alleged fraud was under way, but refused to comment, citing operational reasons. The divorce battle between Michelle and Scot Young was one of the most high profile in British legal history .","Michelle Young fought her ex-husband Scot for eight years in family courts .

"Many British workers won’t consider moving jobs unless they can earn 20 per cent more, according to a new study. Based on the average salary of £26,000, that would mean an extra £5,200.

"Tesco has shut down more than 2,000 user accounts for its online shopping site after a cache of e-mail addresses, passwords and voucher balances were dumped online. Many thought the details on a popular text sharing site were a hoax until Twitter users said they had tested the combinations and they worked. It is thought the list was drawn from previous security breaches and comprised victims who used the same password for Tesco.com - which was not hacked directly - and other, compromised sites. A spokesman said the area of the site affected was for collecting and storing Clubcard points. Every little hack: More than 2,000 e-mail addresses and passwords of Tesco online accounts were leaked on a popular text-sharing website. It is thought they were gleaned from other hacks and not Tesco itself . Cache: How some of the account details were listed, with sensitive information blurred by MailOnline . The hackers would have then tested e-mail and password combinations with Tesco and made a list of positive matches, it is believed. The hack has reignited warnings by security experts for people to use a different password for every single online account which they use. It is not the first time Tesco's online accounts have been compromised. Almost . exactly a year ago customers complained that vouchers worth hundreds of . pounds had disappeared from their Clubcard accounts, raising the . possibility that thieves hacked into the company's system. The . supermarket asked police to investigate claims that dozens of its . customers' Clubcard accounts may have fallen victim to an online fraud, . with some losing vouchers they accumulated over several years. It is small scale compared to other hacks globally, however. Last . month the social networking app Snapchat was caught up in a major . security breach which revealed 4.6 million usernames and phone numbers. And in December, experts found two million Facebook account details on a server in the Netherlands after they were stolen by the Pony Botnet, a malicious software that infects PCs. The list of 2,240 accounts, which has had more than 3,000 hits since it was uploaded on Tuesday, made reference to a tool called the Tesco 'account checker'. The victims had their accounts deactivated by Tesco last night and it is thought a small number had store vouchers stolen. Users had mostly small values of vouchers on their accounts but some had a balance of up to £89. Any people who have had accounts 'compromised' will be offered replacement vouchers by Tesco, a spokesman said. He would not confirm what he meant by the word compromised. Although Tesco was not hacked directly, some people have questioned whether its security measures were strong enough. Tesco said it was 'urgently investigating' the situation. A spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We take the security of our customers’ data extremely seriously and are urgently investigating these claims. 'We have contacted all customers who may have been affected and are committed to ensuring that none of them miss out as a result of this. 'We will issue replacement vouchers to the very small number who are affected.’ Tesco was also hit by theft of customer Clubcard points last year, when hundreds of people reported their loyalty cards had been accessed.

"Alan Pardew wants to take the Crystal Palace team for the first time in their the New Year’s Day fixture at Aston Villa. Although Pardew is unlikely to take the Palace squad for Wednesday’s training session, he has intimated that he wants to be in the thick of it at Villa Park on Thursday. Newcastle are still waiting for Palace to finalise their package with Pardew before announcing the former Eagles midfielder as their new manager. Palace are likely to go public on Wednesday.

Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini arrives at training, while Peter Beardsley (right) gives a thumbs up . With Palace involved in a battle against relegation from the Barclays Premier League, Pardew wants to lead the team out for the first time at Villa Park. Ironically his first game as Palace manager is also the same stadium where Pardew scored the winner for the Eagles in their 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Pardew was at Newcastle United’s training ground on Tuesday where he said goodbye to his players and staff. The 53-year-old arrived via the club’s academy to avoid photographers and camera crews at the entrance to the first-team headquarters. Newcastle’s reserves were playing a behind-closed-doors friendly with Gateshead and Pardew – wearing a hoodie – shook hands with Peter Beardsley’s side, which included Jonas Gutierrez, before returning across the training pitches and to the academy. Pardew has been on Tyneside since news broke of his decision to quit Newcastle for Palace on Sunday night. He met club officials on Monday and the terms of his departure have now been finalised. His exit – after four years in charge – is thought to be amicable and both parties have wished each other well. John Carver and Steve Stone will now take charge of the New Year’s Day visit of Burnley and Saturday’s FA Cup third round tie at Leicester. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen is unsure whether he or Pardew will take charge of the New Year's Day trip to Aston Villa. Millen is preparing the Palace squad assuming he will be in charge of the away dugout at Villa Park. Keith Millen was in charge on Sunday as Crystal Palace drew 0-0 against QPR at Loftus Road . Millen (above) says he is unsure whether he will be retained by Pardew once he takes over at Selhurst Park . All was quiet at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training on Tuesday, with no Pardew announcement imminent . 'I am planning on picking the team against Villa,' Millen told a press conference on Tuesday, 'I said to the chairman that I can do the job [permanently] but he has been busy talking to Newcastle.' He added: 'We will be ready for the Villa game - whoever is in charge.' Millen, who is in his third caretaker stint at Selhurst Park since joining the club in November 2012, revealed he is unsure whether Pardew will keep him on the backroom staff. Dwight Gayle stopped to sign autographs as he left training at lunchtime on Tuesday . James McArthur (left) and Barry Bannan (right) pictured leaving Beckenham training ground . Palace midfielder Joe Ledley, sporting an impressive beard, drives out of Palace's training ground . He said: 'I don't know that will be Alan's decision. I would be happy to work with the football club, depending on my role.' Asked if he was surprised by Pardew's decision to leave St James' Park, Millen said: 'I wasn't surprised. Alan has played for this club, he has a lot of fond memories. It means a lot to him. 'Palace is a good job for someone. The chairman wants to build on the success we have had.' Reflecting on Neil Warnock's time as Palace manager, Millen said: 'It would be difficult for whoever came in after Tony Pulis.'

"Anjelica Huston has revealed the agony of her relationship with Jack Nicholson and how she once cried for three days after Nicholson laughed at the idea of marrying her. The Prizzi's Honor star dated Nicholson, now 77, off-and-on from 1973 to 1989, but she says she was constantly let down by the philanderer as he put other women over her. She recalls how, at the Cannes Film Festival in 1974, 'pretty French girls would come up on motorbikes and say, 'Oh, Jack, you want to ride on my bike with me?' . Scroll down for video . Longtime love: Anjelica Huston claims the attack made her retreat to Jack Nicholson, with whom she shared off-on relationship between 1973 and 1989. The couple are pictured here in 1976 . Longtime love: The Prizzi's Honor star (pictured last month in LA) dated Nicholson (seen last year in LA) off-and-on from 1973 to 1989 . 'He'd get on the bike and leave me standing on the sidewalk,' she writes, '[and] I would just retire to our hotel room in tears.' In her new tell-all Watch Me - the second installment to the 63-year-old's 2013 book, A Story Lately Told - she reveals she was 'very much in love' with the three-time Oscar winner, but he constantly broke her heart. She recalls that once when they were watching the matrimonial game show 'The Newlywed Game,' Nicholson began to mock. 'Oh, little marriage,' he said. 'Little tiny marriage game.' 'I replied, 'If you had any balls, you'd marry me,' ' writes Huston in an excerpt from the book obtained by the New York Post. 'And he said, 'Marry you? Are you kidding?' ' Kindred: Huston said she fell instantly in love with Nicholson, but could not handle his womanizing ways . She recalls a 1973 Carole King concert in Central Park where Joni Mitchell 'sat on the ground between Jack's legs throughout the show' which left her 'hurt and jealous.' She says she 'sobbed for three days after that.' Nicholson's refusal to marry her hurt even deeper because of his lack of commitment to her. She recalls a 1973 Carole King concert in Central Park where Joni Mitchell 'sat on the ground between Jack's legs throughout the show' which left her 'hurt and jealous.' But when she confronted Nicholson about it, he brushed it off. ''Come on,' he said with a sigh, rolling his eyes as if I were boring him to tears, 'she's just an old friend.'' Life story: Watch Me is the second volume of Huston's memoirs . Early in their relationship. Houston's friend and fellow model Apollonia van Ravenstein told her that she slept with Nicholson the week before and that they used to be in a relationship. When Huston confronted Nicholson, he replied, 'Oh, Toots, it was just a mercy f***.' 'That was the first time I'd heard copulation described as an act of compassion,' writes Huston. 'Not that he'd ever vowed to be faithful to me, but somehow he thought it was an acceptable answer.' She says that the perception of Jack as a 'joker' is a 'one-dimensional view' of a complicated man. 'Jack is emotional. Life touches him, and moves him. He is a deep and serious person,' she writes in an excerpt from the book obtained by Vanity Fair. The Oscar winner writes she 'hadn't really been aware' of his reputation as a womaniser at first. 'It kind of grew over time, I think - that idea of Jack: he's baaad!' she says. But when she realised that he was unfaithful, she writes: 'I didn't know what I could do about that. There's only so much you can do.' Their relationship came to a dramatic end when, in 1989, she received a call from Nicholson asking her to come over to his place for dinner. Over dessert, she says, he announced that he had got a woman pregnant. 'The words came smoothly, deliberately - 'Someone's gonna have a baby,'' she writes. The  woman in question was model and actress Rebecca Broussard, who ended up having two of Nicholson's children. His announcement finally marked the end of their tumultuous relationship. She told him, 'There's only room for one of us women in this picture, and I am going to retire from it.' The end: Huston's relationship with Nicholson ended when he announced he was having a child with model and actress Rebecaa Broussard, pictured together in LA in 1994 . Not a once off thing: Nicholson ended up fathering two of Broussard's children, the actress pictured in LA in August . Not long afterward she went to his house and 'beat the living hell out of him.' They talked on the phone after the incident, and Jack said: 'Goddamn, Toots, you sure landed some blows on me. I'm bruised all over my body.' She replied: 'You're welcome, Jack - you deserved it.' She says the pair then laughed. 'It was tragic, really,' she writes. That Christmas, she received a package from him, a pearl-and-diamond bracelet that Frank Sinatra had given Ava Gardner. 'These pearls from your swine. With happiest wishes for the holidays - Enjoy - Yr Jack.' Together again: Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston attend a party together in 1985 . Huston also reveals in the memoir when she met actor Ryan O'Neal . 'I should have known then that I was playing with fire,' Huston writes. 'But I was just self-centered and egotistical and needy enough to follow up with him the next day.' They went on to have a relationship for a year-and-ahalf, but On'Neal and daughter Tatum, then 12, were 'almost a couple unto themselves; he seemed to have few boundaries with her. 'They were often photographed at restaurants and parties and clubs,' she writes. She describes his son, Griffin, as 'only 11, surfing and smoking weed.' But their relationship ended after the actor viciously attacked her at a Hollywood party. The Addams Family star and O'Neal, a trained amateur boxer, were together in the 1970s. Huston writes the Peyton Place star headbutted her during a soiree at a Beverly Hills mansion. 'He turned on me, grabbed me by the hair and hit me in the forehead with the top of his skull,' Huston alleges in the tome. Tempestuous: Huston - pictured left in 1971 - claims in her new book that boyfriend Ryan O'Neal - right - assaulted her at a party in Beverly Hills when they were together . Ryan O'Neal attends the Paper Moon premiere with Tatum O'Neil in 1973 (left) and is pictured this year in Los Angeles (right) 'I saw stars and reeled back. Half blind I ran away from him.' Huston said she had been walking back to the dining room of the house after going to the bathroom when she stopped in a hallway so as not to interrupt the performance of a belly dancer. She claimed this agitated O'Neal, who ran outside where the alleged attack occurred. Huston said she then went back to the bathroom to collect herself and was looked after by some security guards. Kevin O'Neal, the actor's brother, who had witnessed the assault, also comforted her, she says in the book. Eventually Huston agreed to allow O'Neal into the bathroom to talk to her alone, however he allegedly turned on her again. 'Ryan was batting me about the head with an open hand,' the book says. 'Then abruptly he left.' Huston broke up with O'Neal as a result. O'Neal's agent and publicist did not return requests for comment from The MailOnline. The alleged attack saw Huston retreat into the arms of her longtime on-off love Nicholson. Support: Kevin O'Neal (left), brother of Ryan O'Neal, allegedly witnessed the attack on Huston (right) She had left Nicholson in order to take up with O'Neal. Huston also writes of a drug arrest for cocaine possession. The incident occurred at Nicholson's house. Detectives had arrived at the scene to arrest director Roman Polanski, who was accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl. Friends: Controversial director Roman Palanski and Jack Nicholson. Huston writes in her book that Polanski was the reason she was arrested for cocaine possession . The officers began searching Huston. 'They started to go through my handbag, where they found a gram of cocaine,' she wrote. 'Roman and I were bundled into the back of two separate police cars. 'We were under arrest.' After finally ending her relationship with Nicholson, Huston went on to marry sculptor Robert Graham in 1992. The two were together until Graham's death in 2008. They did not have any children.

"A small business owner who took to social media to express her anguish over 'offensive' demands during a photoshoot for her cafe has been overwhelmed by the response she has received. Kylie Rhodes, the owner and head baker for specialty macaron cafe Whisky Business in Capalaba, south-east of Brisbane, had been approached by local newspaper The Wynnum Herald to participate in an article about her business. After taking some initial shots, the reporting journalist allegedly asked Ms Rhodes to put some lipstick on for the photo shoot, and on discovering she didn't have any on hand, requested that a casual staff member be photographed instead.

'She looked at the photo's we'd taken and she didn't like how I looked,' Ms Rhodes told Daily Mail Australia. 'She asked if I had any lipstick to put on, and when I said that I didn't, she told me that I wasn't really what they were looking for.' Ms Rhodes spoke to Daily Mail Australia about the incident, labeling the incident 'offensive' and explaining that she cancelled the photoshoot immediately and asked the journalist and photographer to leave. 'I had just come off a busy breakfast service, and had no idea I was going to be in the photos.

The small business owner decided to post an explanation of why she was offended on her business Facebook page, in order that the journalist would read it and understand. Addressing the Wynnum Herald journalist, she explained that she had 'put her heart and soul in Whisky Business' and that she had sacrificed a lot to get the shop to where it was, including losing sleep, missing out on events in her children's lives, and working twelve hour days. 'I don't have time in my day to give two s***s, let alone one about whether I have lipstick on...I'm a real person, and this is what Real people look like!' she wrote.

"Arsene Wenger says his team will improve in 2015 after claiming that it is 'nearly impossible' that they will have as many injury problems in the next 12 months. The Gunners have been struck with crisis after crisis this season, as key players in all positions have suffered injuries, something that Wenger puts down to so many of his stars taking part in the World Cup. But the Arsenal boss is adamant that, with a full squad, his side will be better in the coming year. Arsene Wenger claims his team will be better in 2015 if they avoid as many injuries as in the previous year . Jack Wilshere is one of 13 Arsenal first-team stars who have had serious injury worries this season . Mesut Ozil has been out since October, but should return in the new year as Arsenal's crisis begins to lift . Thirteen members of the Arsenal first team squad have had significant injuries this season: . Wojciech Szczesny (hip), David Ospina (thigh), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle), Kieran Gibbs (thigh), Laurent Koscielny (Achilles). Mikel Arteta (calf), Jack Wilshere (ankle), Mesut Ozil (knee), Theo Walcott (knee/groin), Aaron Ramsey (hamstring), Abou Diaby (various), Olivier Giroud (foot), Yaya Sanogo (calf) 'I feel it is nearly impossible that we will have the same bad luck on the injury front that we had in 2014,' said Wenger . 'What is explainable in 2014 is that it was after the World Cup and we had many players injured because they played in the World Cup.' Three members of the Arsenal squad won the World Cup with Germany, but of that trio only Per Mertesacker has been able to hold down a first-team place. Mesut Ozil suffered a dip in form before picking up a serious injury in October, while Lukas Podolski has failed to break into the first team this season. Ozil was one of several Arsenal players who were involved deep into last summer's World Cup . Per Mertesacker (centre) has looked off the pace this season after winning the World Cup in Brazil . Lukas Podolski (bottom left) and  Ozil (top right) have both also struggled since winning the World Cup . 'I feel we were very, very unlucky with the injuries we got,' continued Wenger. 'With the number of injuries we’ve had, we survived quite well. 'But I believe, hopefully in the second part of the season, we’ll have more stability, especially defensively, to be more consistent.' Arsenal's injury problems are beginning to ease, with Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky fit again, while Laurent Koscielny returned against West Ham on Sunday. Walcott could feature against Southampton on New Year's Day having been on the bench following his recovery from a groin problem, although striker Danny Welbeck, who scored against West Ham, will need to be assessed before the game. Danny Welbeck will need a late fitness test after being withdrawn late on against West Ham on Sunday . Theo Walcott, who was on the bench at Upton Park, could make a first team return after injury . Midfielder Aaron Ramsey is not just match fit as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury, but Czech playmaker Rosicky should return having been rested. 'Ramsey is not available yet, there is no setback, but it is a bit slower than I expected it to be,' added Wenger. 'Because he had a setback last year, we have to be very cautious with his thigh - he was out for three months, so we have to be a bit more cautious than we would like to be.' Wenger accepts it is a difficult balance to keep all of his players fresh over the hectic Christmas schedule and also not lose the dynamic of the team. Tomas Rosicky scored on his first start of the season on Boxing Day, and should be fit for New Year's Day . Laurent Koscielny returned against West Ham but Aaron Ramsey is still short of match fitness . 'Rotation is a sensitive subject because you can destabilise your team with too much rotation, so you have to find the right numbers of rotating the team,' said Wenger. 'Overall, you want to keep the balance of your team and as well refresh sometimes in the positions where players are a bit tired.' Arsenal could move back into the top four above Southampton with victory on Friday, and could close up on Manchester United, whom they now trail by only three points. Wenger said: 'You give your best and if there is a weakness in front of you, you want to take advantage of it. 'I don't know if there will be any weakness in front of us, but what I know is that we can give our best until the end of the season to have a chance to do it.'","Arsene Wenger says injuries have harmed his side's chances this season .
Wenger suggests the World Cup could be an explanation for problems .

"When coffee chain Starbucks opened the doors of its new shop in Aberystwyth, it must have thought its signs, translated into Welsh, would endear the company to visitors. Instead, it left them baffled. One slogan painted on the wall in white script read: 'Nourishing the human spirit . . . one person, one cup and.' Elsewhere, the company said of its products: 'Light of body and taste our coffee to most easy to drink.' The outlet in Great Darkgate Street, above, the 21st in Wales, is the first to adopt Welsh as its first language . One customer, Sharon Hughes, said: 'It's a nice gesture, but they have got it really wrong. Some of the translations are gobbledegook.' Starbucks has apologised for the spelling mistakes and nonsense grammar, but Welsh language campaign groups have saluted the coffee chain. Their view is that they would rather see 'slack Welsh than slick English' — even if that means swallowing a load of spelling mistakes along with your cappuccino.

Last month, Simon Redfern, director communications, Starbucks Europe, told Wales Online: 'Despite checks on our Welsh language signage, a couple of typos have been spotted, we're going to correct these as soon as possible.' He added: 'We try to create a warm welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy and this works best when we reflect the local culture and language in our store designs. We are really proud of our first dual-language menu board in Welsh and English in our Aberystwyth store.' A spokeswoman added that there are employees in the Aberystwyth Starbucks team who speak Welsh.","Starbucks shop in Aberystwyth is the 21st outlet to open in Wales .

"Malky Mackay was left waiting for his first home win as Wigan manager after Sheffield Wednesday took advantage of Callum McManaman’s sending off to record a rare recent away victory. Austrian striker Atdhe Nuhiu scored his sixth goal of the season to complete a solid away performance for the Owls and leave Wigan without a victory at the DW Stadium since August. There was brief cause for cheer during the Christmas period with when Mackay recorded his first victory as manager with the 2-0 win over Leeds on Boxing Day but his side lacked the cutting edge to see off the Owls in a match lacking in quality. Sheffield Wednesday's Atdhe Nuhiu celebrates after scoring the winning goal at the DW Stadium on Tueasday . Nuhiu rises above Rob Kiernan to give his side the lead in the 76th minute in the Championship clash . Nuhiu powered his header past the Wigan keeper to earn Wednesday a precious away victory .

Subs not used: Lavery, McCabe, Zayatte, Kirkland . Booked: Semedo 72, Nuhiu 93 . Goalscorer: Nuhiu 76 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . McManaman was shown a straight red card in the 65th minute after sliding in on Owls defender Claude Dielna as Stuart Gray’s side put up a stubborn display. Midfielder Adam Forshaw was central to much of the hosts’ bright play in the early stages and his strong run at the heart of the Sheffield Wednesday defence forced Chris Maguire, tracking back from midfield, to hack the ball clear over his own bar. The Owls have won only once on their travels since their promising start to the season in September and set their stall out to attack on the break. Stuart Gray’s side fashioned their first chance courtesy of a counter-attack in the 20th minute when Jacques Maghoma stole possession in the Wigan half and delivered a teasing low cross. It evaded Scott Carson in the Wigan goal but also Nuhiu in the Wednesday attack. Lewis McGugan went close with a deflected low drive from 30 yards that zipped just wide of the post as the Owls got a foothold in the match. Callum McManaman was shown a straight red card just 9 minutes after coming on as a sub for this tackle . McManaman receives his marching orders from the referee after fouling Claude Dielna . James McClean did his best to provide the penetration when he carried the ball from the edge of his own area into a shooting position but saw his drive from a tight angle pushed away by Keiren Westwood. There was a late cameo for Honduras midfielder Roger Espinoza as he made what is likely to be his last appearance for Wigan. The 28-year-old has grown unsettled at the DW Stadium and has reached an agreement to be released from the last six months of his contract. He was greeted by warm applause by the home fans but their mood was soured when McManaman saw red. The Latics almost snatched a point in the closing stages but Ivan Ramis saw his header come back off the post following Shaun Maloney’s inswinging free-kick.

"A fault to the public address system left Portman Road in silence on Tuesday night - but Ipswich’s promotion message was loud and clear. They close 2014 just a point behind leaders Bournemouth at the top of the Championship after goals from Tommy Smith, Daryl Murphy and David McGoldrick saw off Charlton. This result extended Town’s unbeaten sequence to 11 matches - of which eight have been victories - and made for a very happy new year for Mick McCarthy. Daryl Murphy (centre) headed home Ipswich's second in their 3-0 home win against Charlton on Tuesday night . Murphy (front) wheels away in celebration after scoring Ipswich's second goal of the night . Ipswich Town: Bialkowski 7; Chambers (c) 7, Smith 7, Berra 7, Parr 7; Skuse 6.5, Anderson 6.5 (S Hunt 70), Tabb 6.5, Bishop 6 (Bru 83); McGoldrick 8 (N Hunt 90+4), Murphy 7 .

Substitutes not used: Pope, Wilson, Fox, Pigott, Ahearne-Grant, Thomas . Booked: Tucudean . Referee: Christopher Kavanagh (Lancashire) Attendance: 26,157 (1,023 away) Though a glitch in the electrics meant no music could be played or announcements made, leading to a slightly surreal atmosphere inside the ground. When the players emerged from the tunnel for the second-half, for instance, they were greeted by a ripple of polite applause more accustomed to a county cricket ground in the absence of any club compere, thumping club anthems or guitar licks. But despite the relative silence, Ipswich once again showed their Premier League credentials, grafting and grinding their way past Charlton’s firm resistance. Fitness was not an issue despite the punishing Christmas schedule. McCarthy’s men were tenacious, the first to every ball and predatory when their chances arose. McCarthy saw no reason to alter the team that had handsomely beaten fellow promotion challengers Middlesbrough and Brentford in their last two meetings. Even Tyrone Mings, linked with a January move to the Premier League, couldn’t force his way back in after recovering from his infected toe. Charlton were forced into a change after Oguchi Onyewu went down in the warm-ups and Joseph Gomez replaced him in defence. The visitors started the brighter and inside the first minute, Johann Berg Gudmundsson crossed deep from the right and Jordan Cousins, straining to get a clean connection, placed the ball into the side-netting. Highly-rated youngster Tyrone Mings started the match on the bench for the Tractor Boys . Defender Jonathan Parr (left) and Johnnie Jackson battle for the ball during their Championship match . On nine minutes, Ipswich came within a fraction of taking the lead. McGoldrick curled an immaculate 25-yard free-kick around the Charlton wall, only to see the ball cannon back off the inside of the post. The frontman then showed textbook control to bring the ball down after Gomez’s clearance landed on his chest but the shot was dragged wide of the near post. The hosts were marginally the better side and their reward came just after the half-hour. A corner from Jay Tabb was headed into the mixer by captain Luke Chambers and, after Daryl Murphy miscued his shot, it fell kindly for Smith to hook the ball in. It was the defender’s fifth goal of the campaign and his second in two games after he rounded off that 4-2 win at Brentford on Boxing Day. Tommy Smith slides on his knee in celebration after giving Ipswich a first half lead against Charlton . Charlton, who started the night nine points off the play-offs in mid-table, responded well and a pass by Cousins sent George Tucudean into the clear. Sensing the advancing Bartosz Bialkowski, Tucudean slid to get a shot away and the sprawling goalkeeper blocked. The ball fell out to Gudmundsson but his lob wasn’t powerful enough and Christophe Berra cleared in front of his goal. Ipswich came within millimetres of doubling their lead in first-half stoppage time when McGoldrick curled another free-kick onto the post, the ball bouncing out off the back of goalkeeper Neil Etheridge. The first chance of the second-half fell to Charlton after the influential Gudmundsson pirouetted 25 yards from goal and fired a low shot that Bialkowski gathered. It triggered the London side’s best spell of the game and Johnnie Jackson headed over from Tucudean’s right-side cross as the home crowd aired their frustrations. David McGoldrick completed the 3-0 scoreline late on for the hosts at Portman Road . They needn’t have worried as Ipswich doubled their lead just shy of the hour mark. Tabb’s cross found Paul Anderson at the back post and his drilled ball was flicked on by Chambers and McGoldrick’s diving header struck the crossbar. With no Charlton defenders in sight, the ball bounced back for Murphy to nod home his 17th of the season. The visitors didn’t surrender and Ipswich spent much of the closing stages pinned back. Berra had to be composed to clear off the line from Igor Vetokele’s sub-strength header. In the final minute, McGoldrick scored the goal his stellar efforts deserved, running onto a through ball and finishing with aplomb. And towards the end there was plenty of noise. ‘The Town are going up,’ came the refrain from behind the goal. You’d better believe them.

"Steve McClaren's target for 2015 is all too obvious: a return to the top flight. And he was provided with further confidence that his Derby side have what it takes for promotion with the kind of convincing display that has been expected of them during his 14-month tenure. Alex Mowatt’s own goal before the break and a Jake Buxton header shortly after half-time ensured Leeds were never in this contest. It was a night for Derby fans to savour as they enjoyed a seventh straight home win over their old rivals in front of a season’s best crowd of 31,690, even more than watched the recent defeat to Chelsea.

Subs not used: Tonge, Charlie Taylor, Montenegro, Del Fabro. Booked: Mowatt, Cooper, Bellusci, Austin . Referee: Keith Stroud (Hampshire) Att: 31,690 . McClaren had hailed 2014 as one of his best 12 months in football prior to this match – despite defeat in the play-off final to QPR in May - as he hunted a 27th victory to finish the calendar year in style. Leeds had beaten Derby 2-0 at Elland Road earlier this year but their evening got off to a bad start as left back Stephen Warnock injured himself tackling Cyrus Christie and he was replaced by Gaetano Berardi with just eight minutes on the clock. Derby had the better of the play but this game lacked much in the way of clearcut chances early on with Souleymane Doukara seeing an effort blocked for the visitors while at the other end Will Hughes was also denied by a firm Leeds defence. On-loan Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe was not punished despite going down easily in the area while Tommaso Bianchi curled wide from distance and Mirco Antenucci went close for Leeds. But they went on to concede in calamitous fashion on 40 minutes. Hughes burst down the left and his low, teasing cross struck Cooper and then hit Mowatt before beating Marco Silvestri via the crossbar. It was the second game running that Leeds had conceded an own goal. Hughes celebrates after seeing his cross result in a Mowatt own goal in the 41st minute .

And up until that point they had been more than in the game. Derby were buoyed by the goal and could have extended their lead before the break. Captain Richard Keogh’s header from Jeff Hendrick’s free kick was well saved by Silvestri before Ibe shot wide from the edge of the area. The game was as good as up for Leeds at the start of the second half though. Buxton strained to reach a Hendrick 47th-minute free kick but got his head well to the ball to leave Silvestri well beaten. It was his first goal since November 2013 but he still received more red cards this season – two – than he has found the net. Things looked like they would get even worse for Leeds with confidence visibly draining out of them. Ibe went close to Derby’s third as his long ranger was pushed away by Silvestri. Chances kept coming for Derby as Leeds wilted despite their fanatical support and Ibe headed wide from another pinpoint Christie cross but the fact it was not total humiliation will at least give Leeds’ fanatical supporters something to cheer.

"Sixty-five years after Enid Blyton created Noddy, a collection of memorabilia featuring the cheerful children’s book character is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction. It belonged to late bookseller Thomas Schuster, who spent 18 years scouring fairs for items. His widow Greta, from Torquay, has put the items, including a model of Noddy in a car with his friend Big Ears, up for sale at Chiswick Auctions in West London on November 19. Watercolours by Dutch artist Harmsden van der Beek, who created the image of Noddy, are among the lots expected to fetch up to £1,000 each. Classic: One of the Noddy items up for sale this month when it goes under the hammer at Chiswick Auctions . Tony Summerfield, Secretary of the Enid Blyton Society, said: ‘There is a still a lot of nostalgia about Noddy.’ Last year the original Noddy Car, based on a 1969 Fiat Gamine Vagnale, sold at auction for £29,325. The two-seater roadster was built by Italian firm Carrozzeria Vignale and has a top speed of about 65mph thanks to its 595cc engine. Sixty-five years after Enid Blyton created Noddy, a collection of memorabilia is expected to reach £50,000 . The car had covered just 4,553 miles from new and included the numberplate ""NOD 513"". The first auction of Noddy art, in October, 1997, raised £350,000 for parent company Enid Blyton Limited, which was double the pre-sale estimate. More than 200 million copies of the adventures of the wooden taxi driver have been sold worldwide and they remain popular with children today.","Collection of memorabilia featuring Noddy could reach £50,000 at auction .

"The BBC spent £70,000 of licence-payers' money on an annual party for local radio staff despite plans to axe 400 jobs, it has been claimed. Costs for the Corporation's annual Gillard Awards included a £35 Venison dinner for more than 200 people and free travel to and from a hotel, a source said. The hotel costs alone for last year's event topped £25,000, with thousands more spent on alcohol and transport, it was alleged. The BBC spent £70,000 on an events ceremony for local radio staff last year, it was claimed, as the Corporation announced plans to axe 400 jobs to save money . A BBC spokesman this morning rubbished the claims, insisting the total costs for the event were in fact £34,115.15 - just shy of £200 per head. A spokesman could not offer a breakdown of the above figure when asked by MailOnline this morning. The Gillard Awards party, which celebrates local radio, was held months before bosses revealed more than 400 jobs would be axed in a bid to save millions. An estimated 415 jobs are to be scrapped to save £48 million a year by 2016/17 with James Harding, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, described the cuts as ' an extremely difficult undertaking.' 'The challenge is how to make BBC News even better, despite having less money,' he told a London meeting. James Harding, Director of News and Current Affairs said cutting hundreds of jobs was an 'extremely difficult undertaking' Among costs for last year's Gillard Awards was £896 by BBC Tees spent on rail fares, it was claimed. The alleged £25,000 hotel costs were revealed in a Freedom of Information Request, according to the Sun. 'Factor in a conservative estimate of £100 shift cover and £50 transport plus alcohol and hotels and the total exceeds £70,000,' a BBC source told the newspaper. A BBC spokesman this morning denied the figure as 'ludicrous', insisting the total cost of the party was around £34,000. This year's event  he said, cost around £13,000 but not all expenses - including travel, shift cover and hotel stays - had been accounted for yet. The party, at Guildhall in Hull, saw broadcasters and producers sit at large, round tables strewn with wine buckets and candelabras. Guests were put up in the nearby Holiday Inn Express, where rooms start at £69.00, according to the hotel's website. Last year, the party was held in Windsor. A spokesman today praised the awards, saying: 'BBC local radio has been connecting local communities for years. The Gillard Awards honour this by helping ensure quality output and highlight the excellent programmes people listen to across the country.' But critics warned taxpayers may question the need for expensive events when funds are strained. Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance said, 'It is crucial that the BBC watches the cost of these taxpayer-funded celebrations, particularly at a time when the Corporation's having to find necessary savings, resulting in pay freezes and job cuts within the organisation.' In 2011 the Corporation was slammed for spending £70,000 on leaving parties and award ceremonies over 12 months. Figures revealed £20,000 was spent on London parties and £48,000 on alcohol. The Corporation ran up a bill of £581 at Paradise, a gastro-pub in Notting Hill, west London at an event for just 17 people. It also spent £600 at both the Clarendon, in Holland Park and the Iskele, a Turkish restaurant in Clerkenwell. A further £595 was spent at the Stinging Nettle in Shepherd's Bush and the cocktail bar in LVPO in Soho, according to figures released under freedom of information laws. At the time a spokesman said the BBC was 'dramatically' cutting back on expenses.","Corporation spent thousands on Gillard Awards for local radio stations .

"Martin Luther King Day may be a national holiday to mark the civil rights leader’s birthday, but to Sarah Palin it was simply too good an opportunity to let pass without taking a swipe at President Obama. The former vice presidential nominee used her Facebook and Twitter accounts to post the short message which first invoked King's famous I Have A Dream speech before she added a short message asking the president stop playing the race card. ‘Mr. President, in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. and all who commit to ending any racial divide, no more playing the race card,’ wrote Palin.

The former Alaska governor turned political commentator and reality TV star, didn’t specify exactly how she thinks Obama is ‘playing the race card,’ but her controversial post comes just days after The New Yorker published an interview with the president. In the article, which appears in the Jan 27 issue, Obama made reference to his current standing with white voters. ‘There's no doubt that there's some folks who just really dislike me because they don't like the idea of a black president,’ he said. Palin's post also included a photo of the stone in front of the steps leading to the Lincoln Memorial that mark the spot where King addressed the March On Washington in 1963 . ‘Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I’m a black president.’ On Facebook, Palin's post has been liked more than 22,000 times, been shared more than 3,800 times and received more than 1,670 comments.

Four years earlier Democrat nominee John Kerry received 41 percent of the white vote.

"The first major snowfalls across the U.S. are being predicted for the days to come, in the wake of a huge winter storm over Alaska dragging frigid temperatures south. Flurries are expected today in Maine, Wisconsin, Vermont, New Hampshire, upstate New York and even parts of Pennsylvania, with more to follow in the days ahead. Temperatures are set to plummet in the coming days, with temperatures below freezing across much of the north-eastern U.S. by Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Scroll down for video . Frigid storm: The remnants of Typhoon Nuri, which struck Alaska over the past few days, is contribtuing to a cold weather system which will chill the United States in the week to come . Snow today: The above map shows snowfall predictions (in blue) for Sunday November 9 across the U.S., with storms set to hit Wyoming, and the Dakotas in the center of the country, with storms in Wisconsin, northern Michigan, and scattered snowfall in upstate New York, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire and even parts of Pennsylvania . Expanding: A map for tomorrow shows more widespread snow reaching into Wyoming, Idaho, and Minnesota, while persisting in New York, Michigan and parts of New Hampshire . Eastern snow: By Thursday morning, flurries will have hit much of New York, Pennsylvania, all of Michigan, parts of Ohio - and even Virginia, as temperatures plummet . By this time, mountainous parts of the central plains, including Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, will be hit with daytime lows of just 20 degrees. In New England, the cold weather has meant a rush of activity in the region's ski trails, with the Killington resort wrapping up its first week of skiing. The onrush of wintry weather follows a typhoon which swirled over Alaska in the past few days, forcing a remote military installation to batten down the hatches and endure 70mph winds. Snow times: In Vermont, the Killington ski resort (pictured) is already open. Most of the snow is artificial, but the resort has experienced some natural fall, and the cold weather could bring more . Chill: Snow on the ground could be much more widespread after the frigid week to come. Pictured is another part of Killington, Vermont . The tempest fueled by the remnants of Typhoon Nuri was will play a role in generating a high-pressure system that will allow frigid air to blanket the central plains and nose into other states. It became a meteorological 'bomb' after pressure in the storm system dropped 24 millibars in a single day, throwing up huge waves over the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia. The system was centered 220 miles northwest of Adak in the Aleutian chain, David Kochevar, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said early Sunday. 'It's slowly dissipating over the Bering Sea,' he said.Its strongest winds had diminished considerably and were recorded at just 45 mph in Adak and Shemya Island, Kochevar said. Prediction: The above map shows below-average temperatures predicted across most of the country in the days to come . The storm peaked Friday with sustained winds of 70 mph and gusts up to 96 mph on Shemya, forecasters said.The weakened storm was only expected to bring gale-force winds to the Alaska mainland's southwestern coast, typical for this time of year, said NWS meteorologist Shaun Baines.' The worst conditions were out where there's no people,' he said Saturday. On Shemya Island, 120 civilian contractors staff an early warning radar installation for the U.S. military.Eareckson Air Station on the island 1,500 miles southwest Anchorage suffered minor facility damage, Alaskan Command public affairs officer Tommie Baker said. The corners of a roof were bent back and some dumpsters moved around, but no roof was torn off and the dumpsters didn't slam into any vehicles or buildings, Baker said. Workers locked themselves inside to wait out the storm. They had yet to conduct a full assessment of damage around the entire island, but expect no major damage as they are accustomed to far worse conditions. The community averages six weather-related lockdowns a year.The storm surpassed the intensity of 2012's Superstorm Sandy as measured by pressure, but a lack of measuring stations in the remote region means meteorologists didn't have much more data. Sandy caused at least 182 deaths and $65 billion in damage on the East Coast. Nuri, in contrast, hit a sparsely populated region with just a few small communities where people are accustomed to severe weather. The high-pressure system Nuri will help create is expected to send temperatures plunging across a wide swathe of the lower 48 states. High temperatures were forecast to be below freezing on Tuesday across much of Wyoming to Minnesota and parts of Iowa, said Bruce Sullivan of the National Weather Service's prediction center. The high in Great Falls, Montana, is expected to be 7 degrees, Sullivan said. By Wednesday, high temperatures will struggle to get out of the low 30s in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, he said.'Once it gets its momentum going, it's going to keep going south,' Sullivan said.","Flurries expected today in Maine, Vermont and upstate New York .

"The father of a teenager killed when a minibus taking her to a hen party crashed has spoken for the first time about the tragedy - and his wife's feelings of guilt. Bethany Jones, 18, died in April last year while travelling to a hen party with 20 others, including her mother Diane and sister Amy. In an interview with the Daily Mirror Paul Jones, 52, said his wife struggles with guilt, suffers from flashbacks and often wakes up crying in the night following the loss of their youngest daughter. The mother of Bethany Jones, 18, (pictured) is apparently haunted by guilt following her daughter's death . Trainee nurse Miss Jones died after suffering multiple injuries and all of the other passengers on the coach, who were from the Pontefract area, were injured - some severely. Mr Jones said his wife Diane, 50, who suffered pelvis and chest injuries, blames herself for not getting the group off the coach when she realised there may have been a problem with the vehicle - which was later found to have a badly burnt-out clutch. Mrs Jones had told the party they should get off when they smelt smoke just minutes after setting off on their journey. Mr Jones said that his wife's pleas had fallen on deaf ears and she now struggles with feelings of guilt because she did not insist they get off the faulty bus. He said: 'Clearly it wasn't her fault, but she'll have that for the rest of her life; ""why didn't they get off the bus?"" Paul Jones (pictured left) with wife Diane at Bethany's funeral, said his wife is struggling with guilt, suffers from flashbacks and often wakes up crying in the night following the loss of their youngest daughter . The minibus (pictured top right) had slowed to just 5.5mph when a lorry ploughed into it on the M62 last year - firefighters who attended the crash said it was one of the worst they had ever seen . After smelling the smoke minibus driver James Johnson had stopped and inspected the vehicle but told the party it was safe to carry on with the journey. But when the bus was on the motorway it slowed to just 5.5mph and a lorry drove into the back of it, flipping it over and injuring all of those on board - including Miss Jones. Mourners wore pink to Miss Jones' funeral last year - pictured is her brother Ryan . Mr Jones said he rushed to the scene of the crash after receiving a phone call but was numbed by shock when he was told his daughter had been killed. Mr Jones added: 'The only closure will be when I die. I will always be a broken man.' The minibus driver, James Johnson, has since admitted causing her death by dangerous driving. The collision happened on April 26 last year after the 24-seater coach suffered mechanical problems and had come to a 'near standstill' on the motorway when it was hit by a lorry.

"Sir Lawrie Barratt, who made affordable home ownership a reality for millions with his nationwide housing developments has died at the age of 85. Sir Lawrie, who died yesterday at his home in Corbridge, Northumberland, was responsible for important innovations in the way houses were built and marketed. The grandfather, who was threatened by armed robbers alongside wife Lady . Sheila at their home two years ago, had suffered an . illness before his death. Scroll down for video . Sir Lawrie Barratt with wife Lady Sheila Barratt at his granddaughter's wedding. In 1953, he bought a piece of land and built his dream home. That was the 'little acorn from which the Barratt oak tree would flourish' Sir Lawrie joined Greensitt Bros, run by Lewis Greensitt in 1958. The Company eventually became Greensitt and Barratt  in early 1960's and the company was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1968 as Greensitt and Barratt, with Lewis Greensitt and Lawrie Barratt at the helm. In 1963 the company was renamed Barratt Developments and the firm now employs more than 4,000 people and has 25 divisions across Britain. Sir Lawrie had a talent for giving customers what they wanted and getting the details spot-on, coming up with the concept of fitted kitchens and with clever ways to maximise space. As well as changing the way homes were built, he also affected how they were sold, pioneering the concept of part-exchange, which made ownership a reality for families from all walks of life. His marketing ideas were also inspired, with the company's iconic 1970s helicopter TV adverts promoting £7,000 starter homes becoming some of the most memorable of all time. Right to buy: Sir Lawrie was knighted in 1982, after the firm became famous for designing and building high-quality, affordable homes . After leaving school at just 14, Sir Lawrie trained as an accountant and went to work for a legal firm. He built his first home just outside Newcastle in the mid-1950s, because he could not afford the house he wanted. In 1958, he established Greensitt Bros with  partner Lewis Greensitt, and it was renamed Barratt Developments in 1963, a year after he took control. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1968. The company quickly became one of the largest and best-known house builders in the UK, and Sir Lawrie was knighted in 1982. In 1953, 25-year-old Barratt built a four-bedroom home at Darras Hall, near Newcastle upon Tyne, for £1,750. He then purchased a plot across the road and built two more semis, selling them for a profit.In 1958, he joined Greensitt Bros, run by Lewis Greensitt, and it was renamed Barratt Developments in 1963, a year after he took control. The company, which is today worth in excess of £2bn, was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1968, with Greensitt leaving shortly after the flotation. The firm quickly became the biggest . house-builder in the UK, and within 30 years, Sir Lawrie had gone from . owning a single house to building 10,000-15,000 a year across the UK. In 1983, the firm sold a record 16,500 houses and became the nation’s largest housebuilder. In 1985, the Thatchers bought a Barratt home for £400,000 and Sir Lawrie comes out of retirement briefly in 1991 to save the company after £106m losses. Barratt Developments now employs more than 4,000 people in 25 divisions across the UK. He retired from his roles as chairman and chief executive in 1988 but was called out of retirement in 1991 to become chairman again and restore the business's ailing fortunes, finally retiring for good in 1997. He remained Life President and a significant shareholder in the Company. Just two years ago, the entrepreneur and his wife, Lady Sheila, suffered a harrowing experience when they were tied up in their home by three masked men. The raiders, who were armed with crowbars, bound and gagged the couple before stealing a hoard of expensive jewellery. Their loot included a 338-stone necklace, matching bracelet and earrings and a 35-stone ruby and diamond cluster ring. Mark Clare, chief executive of Barratt Developments, said: 'Sir Lawrie founded the company in 1958 and established it as the largest and best-known house-builder in the country. 'He had the vision to understand how deeply rooted the desire for home ownership is within this country and he then set out to meet that aspiration by designing and building high-quality, affordable homes. 'Under his leadership, the company brought home ownership within reach of many people through innovative support for home-buyers and the high-profile way it was promoted. 'I believe that it is no exaggeration to say that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK today, across every walk of life, that have bought or lived in homes inspired by Sir Lawrie.' Fascinating life: Sir Lawrie, pictured in 1993, found innovative ways to support home-buyers - but trouble came to his doorstep two years ago, when he and his wife were attacked by armed robbers . Sir Lawrie with Margaret Thatcher at the foundation stone laying ceremony at St Peter's Basin at Newcastle Quayside . Pioneer: Sir Barratt changed the way homes were built, marrying high quality with affordability through innovative schemes . North East Chamber of Commerce chief executive James Ramsbotham told the Newcastle Journal: 'Sir Lawrie was a well- respected and much-admired member of the North East business community and a pioneer in his field. 'My thoughts are with his family and friends on this very sad day.' Sir Lawrie and Lady Barratt's granddaughter Fiona is married to the former England player Sol Campbell and their son Peter Barratt opened a series of garden centres. Sir Lawrie was also heavily involved in charity work and helped to raise money for Red Cross by opening up the couple’s gardens to the public each year. This year Barratt won the Housebuilder og the Year award. Judges called the company an 'outstanding all-rounder, showing its prowess in the fields of zero carbon, regeneration, design and landscaping'. Meteoric rise: Jjust ten years after its launch in 1958, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange. It remains one of the largest house builders in the UK . Home improvement: Under Sir Mawrie's stewardship, Barratt offered products that have since become industry-standard, such as fitted kitchens .","Sir Lawrie left home at just 14 and went on to found Barratt Developments .

"Paramedics were called to a Colorado fish restaurant that accidentally served rum and vodka cocktails to six children aged two to eight. The cousins all ordered Shark Nibbles from the kids' menu - a sweet blue soft drink that comes with a toy shark. But it was not until they had all drunk a 'significant amount' 30 minutes later that the waitress rushed back saying they were 'made with the wrong ingredients'. The two-year-old girl had finished her entire drink. Scroll down for video .

"Tom Cruise stayed at the Marriott Hotel in Peterborough, where a staff member who did not recognise him, asked if he had a loyalty card . He may be renowned for his role as a secret agent in the Mission Impossible series - but it seems Tom Cruise took it to a new level while staying at the Marriott Hotel in Peterborough. And launching his own mission - called Operation Fromage - left one member of staff red-faced after he failed to recognise the Hollywood star and asked him if he had a loyalty card. The 52-year-old, who had been in the Cambridgeshire city to film his next Mission Impossible movie, was reportedly eating breakfast when the waiter made the blunder. Cruise and co-star Simon Pegg, 44, were filming at nearby RAF Wittering where the actor was suspended from an Airbus A400M at 5,000ft. He had checked into the hotel with production staff for five nights under the name Operation Fromage, which is French for cheese, after the close-by village of Stilton, according to The Sun. A source, speaking to the newspaper about the waiter's gaffe, said: 'Tom took it in good jest, but given the security operation to keep his and Simon's stay under wraps it was funny no one seemed to bat an eyelid.' It also reports that Cruise and Pegg were spotted by locals, including a group of salesmen, who were shocked to see the action star. Last Monday the Oscar nominee was filming one of the action scenes for Mission Impossible 5 scene where he fought his way across a four-engine military aircraft at the Royal Air Force station. The Top Gun actor had been insistent on performing his own stunts throughout the movie, but the crew were making a realistic effort of reenacting the combat scene from a safe, stationary position. Chris McQuarrie, the movie's director was on set in Peterborough last weekend and admitted that the cast and crew were contending with serious rain. The Jack Reacher director has been keeping an #MI5diary on Twitter and tweeted: 'Sincerest thanks to everyone at RAF Wittering, Pilot Ed Strongman and team #Airbus.' The  actor had been staying at the Marriott Hotel in Peterborough (pictured) for five nights during filming . Tom Cruise had been spotted with his co-star Simon Pegg by local salesman who said they were gobsmacked . The Peterborough Marriott Hotel is about a 15 minute drive from the air base where filming took place.

"These pictures show Titanus giganteus, the world's largest beetle and one of the most mysterious creatures on the planet. Better known as the Titan beetle, it can grow up to seven inches long and has a jaw so strong that it can snap a wooden pencil in two. Despite its terrifying size and fearsome bite, it is entirely harmless to humans, according to Oddity Central. Titanus giganteus is the world's largest beetle but is one of the most mysterious creatures on the planet. The Titan beetle can grow up to seven inches long and has a jaw so strong that it can snap a wooden pencil in two . The insect hides away in South America's humid tropical rainforests and only ventures out to find a mate. Intriguingly the larvae of the giant insect has never been seen. However, scientists believe that the grubs are two inches in diameter and can be up to a foot long. Judging by large boreholes found in dead trees, scientists believe the grubs feed on decaying wood underground for several years before they are fully grown, . The male beetle does not feed during its adult life but needs energy to fly. The energy comes from the reserves it gathered in its pupa stage and is used to fly just long enough to find a mate. The creature is so large that it does not have enough energy to fly from the ground so instead must climb trees and launch itself from a branch before it actually takes to the air. Females wait for the males to find them and fertilise their eggs so are consequently very rarely seen. The male beetle (pictured) does not feed throughout its adult life but needs energy to fly. This energy comes from the reserves it gathered in its pupa stage and is used to fly just long enough to find a mate . They defend themselves by hissing in warning and then use their huge jaws to bite attackers. The Titan beetle also has incredibly strong legs and sharp claws that can tear animal and human flesh, but reportedly do not attack unless provoked. They live in the rainforests of Brazil, Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, the Guianas and Peru, where locals attempt to catch them after dark with bright lights. While many people try and avoid the fearsome beetle, some tourists pay a lot of money to attempt to see the insect in its natural habitat. Indeed the creature is a brilliant example of a successful eco-tourism initiative. The largest Titan beetle ever discovered was a staggering 16.7 centimetres long and was found in French Guyana. A specimen of a normal-sized beetle can cost up to £400. The beetle defends itself by hissing in warning and then use its huge jaws to bit attackers. It also has incredibly strong legs and sharp claws that can tear animal and human flesh, but does not attack unless provoked .","Titanus giganteus hides in the rainforests of South America and is capable of snapping attackers with its jaws or tearing their flesh if provoked .

"Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s children have finally warmed to their father’s mistress-turned-wife almost twenty years since he announced their engagement. When the iconic Labor leader left his First Lady and wife of 39 years, Hazel Hawke, in 1995 to marry his biographer Blanche d’Alpuget, the news shook the nation. But what concerned Mr Hawke most was the huge family fallout. With their lives torn apart, his children were extremely vocal about their anger and upset. In a two-part documentary for the ABC, Mr Hawke has revealed that only now are his kids finally warming to Ms d’Alpuget. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke married his mistress Blanche d’Alpuget in 1995 . ‘The kids weren't happy about the fact that I divorced and married Blanche. And they weren't as nice to Blanche as they could and should have been,’ he said. Ms d'Alpuget said: 'They didn't want me as part of the family and they actually put that in writing.’ Australia’s ‘common man’ Prime Minister appeared in his first ever TV biography, which profiles what the  Labor legend - who drink brandy with breakfast - is really like, before he turns 85 next month. It was just three years ago that Mr Hawke’s daughter Sue Pieters-Hawke and Ms d’Alpuget were seen arguing at Brisbane airport, indicating that all was still not well within the family. Ms Pieters-Hawke has now spoken for the first time about how they got over their differences, explaining: 'It took a bit of time to come around I think but it’s a matter of deep satisfaction to me that the family has reformed. 'Blanche has been a great step grandmother to my kids and a great stepmother to me.' He was married to his first wife Hazel Hawke -  a much-loved First Lady - for 39 years . Bob Hawke's daughters Sue Pieters-Hawke and Rosslyn Dillon appear in the documentary to talk about the family fall out surrounding their parents' divorce . Blanche and Bob had an on-and-off affair for twenty years while he was married to Hazel . In the ABC show, her sister Rosslyn Dillon also said she disliked her stepmother so much that she didn’t want to talk to her. ‘I think I said something to Blanche along the lines of, “Oh well, if you're still around in 10 years we'll see if we can sit down and have a chat then”,’ she said. Mr Hawke’s first wife Hazel, who he married in 1956 before he was elected as the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia on 11 March 1983, died last year from a stroke after suffering from Alzehimer’s. They had four children together, including Susan Pieters-Hawke, Stephen and Roslyn, but their fourth child, Robert Jr, died in his early infancy in 1963. Mr Hawke went to see his former wife before she died on May 23, 2013, and sang to her by her bedside, his grandson David Dillon told The Australian. ‘I know it would have given him amazing closure to be there with someone who committed a significant portion of her life to him with such unwavering support,’ Mr Dillon said. The former Labor leader was known for his affair and his love of drinking but was also extremely popular . Bob Hawke's family was torn apart when he finally decided to divorce Hazel and marry Blanche . Mr Dillon told the paper while his mum Roslyn was being treated for her heroin addiction, Mr and Mrs Hawke cared for him like parents. The admired down-to-earth stateswoman was given a public memorial at Sydney Opera House, where more than 1,600 came to show their support, including then Prime Minister Julia Gillard Governor-General Quentin Bryce and former prime ministers John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Mr Hawke. Mrs Hawke reportedly tolerated the powerful leader’s open relationship with Ms d'Alpuget whilst he was Prime Minister. But their marriage ended three years after his retirement from politics in 1991. Never before seen photographs from his younger years and family life show the once happy family together . Hazel died in 2013 after suffering with dementia and Bob sang to her by her bedside before she passed away . Speaking at his home in Northbridge, on the lower North Shore in Sydney, for the ABC’s Australian Story, Mr Hawke told how Ms d'Alpuget tried to build a relationship with his children and is now closest with Rosslyn Dillon. ‘She's been particularly helpful to my youngest child Rosslyn and I think from the original feelings of perhaps resentment that Rosslyn had, they've moved to one where Rosslyn really loves Blanche,’ he said. Ms Dillon told the show: ‘Particularly since I lost Mum, we have become extremely close. ‘She's a very funny woman, very loving, very passionate, a very wicked sense of humour and her and Dad are so in love.’ Blanche told Australian Story that Bob's children once put in writing how much they disliked her . Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Blanche d'Alpuget were seen together at memorial service for former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, at the Town Hall in Sydney on Wednesday, November 5, 2014 . Bob Hawke lives with Blanche at their home in Sydney's lower North Shore . Mr Hawke is now Australia’s oldest living former Prime Minister. He grew up in the union movement and spent a decade as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. As well as being renowned for his support from those inside the Labor party he was known for his love of beer, footy and cricket. He famously holds a world record for seeing off a yard of ale in just 11 seconds during the 1950s. Earlier this year, egged on by dozens of boisterous fans dressed as legendary commentator Richie Benaud, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke downed a pint of beer in 10 seconds flat at the Sydney Ashes Test. The 84-year-old didn't hesitate when challenged by rowdy fans and was previously caught on camera doing the same thing at the same Sydney Test last year.

"Many British youngsters are too lazy, ill-educated and lacking the work ethic to compete for jobs, business leaders said last night. The warning came in response to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith’s appeal to employers to ‘give our young people a chance, and not fall back on labour from abroad’. In a speech which evoked Gordon Brown’s ill-fated ‘British jobs for British workers’ campaign, Mr Duncan Smith said employers had a ‘responsibility to help our young people get their first foot on the jobs ladder’. David Frost said that foreign workers were . better skilled and have the right attitude after IDS issued a plea to . business to recruit jobless British youths . But business leaders rejected the calls – and warned that many simply lack the ‘work ethic’ and skills to compete against migrant labour. David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said a generation had been ‘failed’ by schools. ‘After 11 years of formal education, employers say they get kids coming to them who can’t write, who can’t communicate, and who don’t have that work ethic,’ he said. ‘And I think we’ve also got to face up to having a benefits system which does not incentivise that many to work. Yesterday's Daily Mail . ‘So, clearly, when you have these bright young Eastern Europeans who really want to work and have very good customer service skills then employers are going to turn to them – and quite right. These businesses are competing in a globalised economy.' Andrew Cave, of the Federation of Small Businesses,  echoed concerns about education and accused Mr Duncan Smith of making a ‘glib, throwaway political comment’. And Neil Carberry, the CBI’s director for employment policy, said firms had to ‘choose the best person for the job’. In addition, employment lawyers warned that any firm favouring British workers could fall foul of the Equalities Act. Downing Street said Mr Duncan Smith’s speech to a think-tank in Spain – which was anticipated in yesterday’s Daily Mail – was made in a ‘personal capacity’. A spokesman refused to endorse the idea that  firms should give preference to British youngsters over migrants, saying it was a  ‘decision for business’. But Number 10 insisted Mr Duncan Smith had been ‘stating government policy’ in his call for a tougher approach to immigration. Curbs on Romanians could be extended . Yesterday, he highlighted figures showing that more than half of the jobs created last year went to immigrants. He said that without action from both government and business, a new generation of youngsters would be condemned to a life on benefits. The Work and Pensions Secretary added that they needed to work together to ensure the immigration system ‘works in the interests of Britain’ and the unemployed are given a ‘level playing field’. His speech is likely to stoke tensions with the Liberal Democrats over immigration. As more people flock to the job centre employers have spoken out on why they hire so many migrant workers . Sources close to Nick Clegg insisted he was relaxed about it, but Business Secretary Vince Cable is known to be fighting with Home Secretary Theresa May over the issue. Mr Duncan Smith was supported by fellow Tory MPs – as well as former Labour welfare minister Frank Field, who stressed he was ‘speaking for the vast majority of people in this country’. And Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said Mr Duncan Smith was right to stress that business had a ‘responsibility’ to help get young people working. The work ethics of foreign workers make them better candidates for jobs than many British workers .","Needs to be 'an immigration system that gives the unemployed a level playing field'
But Chambers of Commerce boss counters: 'They expect young [British] people to come forward to them who are able to read, to write, to be able to communicate and have a strong work ethic. Too often that is not the case'"
"Treasurer Joe Hockey's personal wealth has come under the spotlight after his comments that 'poor people don't drive cars' led to accusations that he is a 'cigar-chomping Foghorn Leghorn' who is out of touch with Australians. Mr Hockey and his millionaire banker wife Melissa Babbage, own four properties between them, including a five-bedroom harbourside family home in Hunters Hill, one of Sydney's wealthiest harbourside suburbs, believed to be worth more than $5 million, which they bought for $3.5 million in 2004. Their $10 million property portfolio also includes  a 200 hectare cattle farm in Queensland and a beautiful six-bedroom coastal retreat with 180-degree views of the beach in Stanwell Park, an hour south of Sydney. Mr Hockey's statement of registrable interests, made in 2010, also lists him as joint owner of a property in the prestigious Canberra suburb of Forrest. Scroll down for video . Joe Hockey came under fire for his comments, which he made on ABC radio earlier this week . Joe Hockey was pictured enjoying a cigar after delivering his May budget, in which he declared Australia to be a nation of 'lifters not leaners' The treasurer and his wife own four properties with an estimated total value of more than $10 million. They include: . Mr Hockey has come under fire after remarking yesterday that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households because poor people don't have cars or don't drive far. 'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he told ABC Radio in Brisbane. Mr Hockey  has previously insisted that while his opponents might run the 'wealthy line', the money really belongs to his wife, who until 2011, worked as head of the foreign exchange and global finance division of Deutsche Bank. But Mr Hockey's life hasn't been one you would typically associate with struggle. The treasurer, who was pictured enjoying a cigar outside parliament after announcing his federal budget in May, attended the elite St Aloysius' College in Milson's Point. When he left home for university, he attended one of the country's most expensive university residences, St John's College at the University of Sydney, a popular institution for Sydney's private school educated children. It was at Sydney University that he got his start in politics, elected as the president of the Student Representative Council. In his statement of registrable interests of interests in 2010 Mr Hockey lists that he is a patron of two north shore golf clubs, a member of the North Shore Historical Society and a member of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, among other charitable, sporting and cultural groups. Joe Hockey claims his extensive wealth, which includes a property portfolio worth more than $10 million, really belongs to his wife Melissa Babbage, who was an executive banker with Deutsche Bank . The controversial fuel excise has attracted criticism from Labor, the Greens and the head of the Nationals who claimed the measures would hit rural Australians harder than city-dwellers . An aerial shot of Joe Hockey's cattle farm in Queensland . Mr Hockey's comments about the driving habits of poor came as the government wants to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who say it will hit low-income families the hardest. The comment drew a rebuke from Labor leader Bill Shorten and some welfare groups. 'Are you serious, Joe Hockey? Are you really the cigar chomping, Foghorn Leghorn of Australian politics where you're saying that poor people don't drive cars?' Mr Shorten told reporters in Perth. Mr Hockey today dismissed Labor criticism that he was out of touch with everyday Australians, calling Labor 'hypocrites' and saying 'I don't care about that commentary,' while speaking to ABC Radio. A number of politicians from Mr Hockey's own Coalition have spoken out about the controversial budget measure, concerned that it will hit rural communities hardest. NSW Nationals senator John Williams says people in the bush need cars, a point echoed by Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald. 'You have to have a car whether you're rich or poor, you need a vehicle to be able to get from one place to the other,' he told ABC Radio on Thursday. 'Regional Australians don't have the alternative of public transport of other means of getting there.' But the treasurer disagreed, saying there was a clear trend that showed the higher the household income, the more fuel taxes were paid. St Vincent de Paul Society chief executive John Falzon said the treasurer was making a massive assumption. 'In fact many low-income households are heavily dependent on quite old motor vehicles that are not terribly fuel efficient as their only means of transport,' he told Fairfax Media. The Federal Government wants to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise . On Wednesday, Joe Hockey brushed off the controversy surrounding his comments . Cheaper housing was also often located in areas that were poorly served by transport, but far from jobs, so they have to travel long distances at times. When quizzed by reporters in Perth later on Wednesday, Mr Hockey was unrepentant, labelling the reaction to his comments as 'hysteria'. 'The fact is that there is a clear trend in Australia - the higher the household income the more fuel taxes are paid by the household,' he said. His office also released figures that showed average weekly expenditure on petrol ranges from $16.36 for those on the lowest income to $53.87 among the highest incomes. Households in relatively disadvantaged areas were also less likely to own motor vehicles than those in relatively advantaged areas. Where motor vehicles were owned, households in relatively disadvantaged areas were most likely to own only one car whereas households in relatively advantaged areas were more likely to have two or more motor vehicles.","Treasurer Joe Hockey's property portfolio is worth an estimated $10 million .

"It barely measures half an inch long - but this tiny insect is capable of kicking up a stink. The halyomorpha halys is headed for our shores, experts say, and if you are there when it arrives you will certainly know about it. Known as the marmorated stink bug, it is named after the putrid stench it releases from its glands as a defence mechanism. It has already created plague proportions in the US, has been spotted in Switzerland, France and Italy and biologists say it will ‘inevitably’ invade Britain. Two bugs have already been intercepted on imported timber on Britain’s shores, and it is only a matter of time before more come into the country. Scroll down for video . The brown marmorated stink bug, known for the stench it releases as a defence mechanism, will arrive in Britain in imported furniture, say experts . It is particularly pernicious because it invades homes when the first frosts appear each autumn. The bugs, native to China, Japan and Taiwan, were accidentally introduced to the US in the mid-1990s. They have since spread to 40 states and in 2010 ruined over £23 million worth of American apple crops alone. The distinctive brown adult bug is shaped like a shield and resembles several species common in Britain. But the stench of rotten garbage it produices is unique. Once mated, females lay up to 30 light green eggs on the underside of leaves that can hatch in three days. Entemologist Max Barclay, of London’s Natural History Museum, said: ‘I think the brown marmorated stink bug will establish a population here. It is only a matter of time. ‘It will make its presence felt fairly quickly because it comes into people’s homes in the autumn and winter. ‘Ancestrally, it used to hibernate in abandoned caves and houses are the next best thing. ‘They are a nuisance and people won’t like brown stink bugs in their homes. In hotels in southern American states you have signs warning about stink bugs in rooms because that is the way it is. ‘It is very hard to get rid of them because they lay eggs and even if you get the exterminators in to vacuum them up, they come back the following year. The Government’s Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) is warning people to check imported plants and containers for any sign of the pest. Fera’s senior entomologist Chris Malumphy said that the bug could well become a public nuisance in the UK. In the US, the brown marmorated stink bug has been detected in 41 states as well as two Canadian provinces, posing severe agricultural problems in six states and nuisance problems in fifteen others . Mr Malumphy told Horticulture Week magazine: ‘We have had a second interception on imported timber, so the bug has been found twice in the UK. ‘We have done a risk assessment. There is evidence the bug would be able to establish in the south of England. ‘In North America, it reaches plague proportions and there are records of hundreds or even a thousand in people’s houses. ‘I don’t expect plague proportions here but they make an evil, repellent odour to ward off predators, so a large number of bugs coming into your house is a rather compelling public nuisance.’ The bug usually produces up to five generations per year in warmer climates but only one or two in cooler climates. Mr Malumphy said: ‘Later generations cause the most economic damage. The UK climate means the bug wouldn’t have a significant economic impact on agriculture or horticulture like in North America.’ Dr Sam Jones, technical manager of pest management firm International Pheromone Systems, said: ‘The bug is going to get here at some point soon. ‘It is already in France and Germany and they could hop into crates of goods or timber or plants being transported. And since it hibernates in buildings over the winter, once it is here there is a good chance that it will be a problematic pest. ‘These are bigger than ladybirds and when you try and disturb them or hoover them they produce a really foul smell. ‘Researchers are trying to identify the chemical the stink bugs release to attract others, so that they can then be lured into pheromone traps.’","Marmorated stink bug is named after putrid stench it uses as a defence .

"A recently uncovered Triceratops skull could be the biggest ever found, according to a fossil hunter who hopes to sell it for more than $1million. Alan Detrich bought the skull from a colleague who unearthed it near Buffalo, New York, and is planning to clean it up and attach it to the body of another Triceratops before selling it on. He estimates the decapitated dinosaur was at least twice as big as an elephant, the modern day animal to which Triceratops are usually compared in size. Biggest ever? The Triceratops skull unearthed near Buffalo, New York, that one fossil hunter believes may be the biggest ever found . Valuable: Alan Detrich, pictured left preparing the skull for transport, bought the skull of a fellow fossil hunter and hopes to sell it on for more than $1million . However, experts will not know how the size of the skull compares to others until the cleaning process is completed, which is likely to take as long as a year-and-a-half, the Rapid City Journal reported. The paper caught up with Mr Detrich has he transported the eight-foot skull through their patch on a flat-bed truck on his way to Wyoming. On his way he stopped at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research for help with analysis of the skull. The institute's president Pete Larson was impressed with the find, but couldn't confirm it was the biggest ever. Tyrannosaurus Rex used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off Triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures, a new theory claims.Research into Triceratops fossils from the U.S. shows that the Jurassic apex predator first slew its prey, then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient-rich neck meat hidden by body armour.Tyrannosaurus was well known to feed on the Triceratops but until now few have questioned how it got around the herbivore's tough neck frill. Mr Larson told the Journal the creature has a 'huge' 16in nasal horn. 'It's definitely big,' he said. 'There's no question about that.' Native only to the Western U.S., Triceratops lived about 66million years ago. One of the most recognisable of all dinosaurs, the stocky herbivores had three horns and a large bony frill which covered their necks. It shared its habitat with and was a frequent meal of the fearsome Tyrannosaurus, with which it is popularly represented as doing battle. They are also thought to have turned their horns on rivals in battles for dominance and courtship displays. Despite their fame, there are thought to be only six mounts of original Triceratops skeletons in existence. 'Skeletons . are quite rare even though they're really well-known,' Mr Larson told . the Journal, . He added that skulls are more common, although there are . still only about 100 that have been recovered. Huge: Mr Detrich believes the owner of the skull may have been twice the size of an elephant, the modern day animal to which Triceratops are usually compared in size . Rare: He hopes to pair the skull with a skeleton he's unearthing near Fort Peck, Montana, before selling the complete dinosaur. There are thought to be currently only six complete Triceratops in existence . Mr Detrich, who has been a fossil hunter since the Nineties, bought the skull from fellow fossil hunter John Carter who dug it out of the ground over a few months. He now hopes to pair the skull with a skeleton he's in the process of digging up near Fort Peck, Montana, before selling the complete dinosaur. He told the Journal he expects the find to be valuable. 'Oh yeah, it's going to be over a million bucks,' he said.",Regular Triceratops usually thought to have been as big as an elephant .
"Anti-gay hackers have reportedly shut down more than 70,000 accounts on a Russian gay dating app and threatened its users with arrest.

VIDEO Scroll down for . as activists go inside Sochi's most popular GAY bar. Hunters become hunted: Users of the Russian equivalent of Grindr received these threatening messages . Russia has faced global pressure over its law banning gay 'propaganda', which makes it illegal to tell children homosexuality is acceptable, and a surge of vigilante attacks that have accompanied it. Groups with names like Occupy Paedophilia hunt down gay men, abduct them, film themselves torturing them and post the footage on YouTube, with campaigners saying police are unwilling to act. The founder of the app - whose advertising claims its users have sex every seven seconds - sent veteran gay culture journalist Andy Towle evidence of the mass attack. The threatening message was sent at 11.52pm on February 1, he said - then the next morning, users trying to open the app in Sochi and the nearby district of Adler found themselves locked out. They were faced with a message saying they had entered the wrong password and would be blocked for 55,260 minutes - or 38 days. Account locked: More apparent screenshots from the app, provided to MailOnline by its anonymous founder . The app's founder, who asked his full name to be kept anonymous, told MailOnline: 'The app came under an attack by hackers, resulting in users from Sochi receiving threats of arrest and their profiles being blocked. Several hours later some 72,000 user profiles were deleted in Russia. 'I'm sure that this provocation against the gay community was initiated by the Russian authorities and was an attempt to eliminate any gay interaction during the Olympic Games in Sochi, including any between athletes, tourists and locals. 'The hackers didn't leave any traces, but it is clear from an obvious spelling mistake that they were not native English speakers. I'm sure that the attackers were acting in the interest of Russian authorities. 'I urge the entire gay community and all of those who consider the Internet to be a free zone to boycott not only Russian vodka but also everything that is linked to the Olympics and not to buy any Olympic souvenirs.' The app claims to have more than a million users worldwide, 100,000 of whom are in Russia. Popular: The Hunters website claims one of its users has sex every 20 seconds - but more than 70,000 profiles were shut down and users were sent threatening messages.

Hook-ups: The app bears close similarities to the U.S.-based gay hook-up app Grindr (file photos) Engineers managed to restore about a quarter of the deleted profiles, but the rest were lost permanently, he claimed. The firm reacted by immediately moving its servers from Russia to elsewhere in Europe. The app, similarly to Grindr, gives users a 'grid' of other members who are nearby, listing them in the order of their proximity. Grindr chiefs have insisted the service is not just for sex, preferring to describe it as a 'location-based social networking application'. Friday's Winter Olympics opening ceremony featured a performance by 'faux-lesbian' singers tATu, who sang a song about love between two teenage girls - despite gay rights protesters being arrested hours later. Russian authorities said the duo were chosen because they were one of the few Russian pop acts known worldwide. Gay rights have been top of the agenda in Sochi, with Barack Obama not attending the ceremony and sending a delegation which included openly gay athletes instead.

According to New Republic, the catchphrase among those posted to cover the Olympics is 'Have you been to Mayak yet?'. Club owner Andrey Tanichev said he has given more than 200 interviews to reporters from almost every country in the world - 'except the Spanish, God bless them'. Rejected: Music festival organisers were left hanging on the telephone for Eighties legends Blondie . Eighties pop-rock icons Blondie refused the offer of a gig at the Sochi Olympics because of Russia's record on gay rights. Singer Debbie Harry posted a photo of the original offer on Twitter (right) with the words 'PASS, HUMAN RIGHTS' scrawled across it in black ink. The band, famous for their hits Atomic, Heart of Glass, One Way or Another and Rapture, were invited to play the Red Rocks music festival in Sochi on February 13 for a five-figure fee. The free gig would have had an audience of up to 25,000 people on the Olympic main stage, preceded by a medal ceremony. It would have been sponsored by SberBank Russia, the largest in Eastern Europe and the third-largest in Europe. But the outspoken singer flatly rejected the offer, joining the likes of Lady Gaga and Madonna in attacking Russia's 'gay propaganda' law.

"He once said his recipe for perfect happiness was a good book and a good bottle of wine. But Johnny Depp – who famously sports a ‘wino forever’ tattoo on his arm – has turned teetotal for his latest movie role. Depp, 48, has given up alcohol to play Tonto in a remake of the hit TV series The Lone Ranger – and has told how a painting inspired his dramatic on-screen look. The star is a practitioner of ‘method acting’ which involves remaining in character even when the cameras have stopped rolling. Sidekick: Johnny Depp, left, gave up drinking to play Tonto in The Lone Ranger . Depp, who is filming the £100 million Western in New Mexico, stopped drinking because loyal sidekick Tonto is a teetotaller. A source said: ‘Johnny remains in character on set. The only time he breaks character is to talk to Vanessa [Paradis, his long-term partner] and their kids. ‘Tonto doesn’t drink, so Johnny hasn’t been drinking.’ Depp appears in black-and-white make-up with a black crow on his head for his latest role. He took inspiration for the look from the painting by Kirby Sattler entitled I Am Crow. Role play: Depp is a practitioner of 'method acting' Depp said: ‘I looked at that painting and thought, “That’s it.” The stripes down the face and across the eyes . . . you could almost see the separate sections of the individual. ‘There’s this very wise quarter, a very tortured and hurt section, an angry and rageful section and a very understanding and unique side. I saw those parts, almost like dissecting a brain, these slivers of the individual.’ Depp added: ‘I have some native American in me. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of native American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian.’ It isn’t the first time Depp has been inspired by art. He based his Pirates Of The Caribbean character, Captain Jack Sparrow, on a painting of rock legend Keith Richards dressed as a pirate. The source added: ‘Johnny’s Tonto is far removed from the classic TV version of the character. This Lone Ranger is much darker and tells the story of the expansion of the railroad across the American West from the point of view of the American Indians who were kicked off their reservations.’ Rising Hollywood actor Armie Hammer, who played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network, stars as the Lone Ranger, with British actors Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Wilkinson among the cast. The source said: ‘The film is told through Tonto’s eyes and shows the injustices handed out to native Indians. Johnny’s Tonto is no mere sidekick. He’s the driving force of the film.’",The method actor is following in the loyal sidekick's footsteps by giving up drink for his latest role in The Lone Ranger .
"Roy Hodgson insists that England's faith in Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck has paid off handsomely this season. The former Manchester United player has been selected by Hodgson whenever he has been available and repaid that confidence by netting five times for the Three Lions this season, while also impressing at the Emirates with his new club. Hodgson told the FA website: 'Danny Welbeck, of the young England players, is one of the most experienced because we have always kept faith with him. Arsenal and England forward Danny Welbeck has impressed for club and country this season . Welbeck nets his fourth league goal of the season during Arsenal's 2-1 defeat of West Ham . 'Even in the first squad I selected in 2012, Danny was in it, despite the fact that at the time he wasn't featuring for Manchester United. 'We've kept faith with him through that time until his move to Arsenal where he is now getting lots and lots of plaudits.' Hodgson is no stranger to selecting young players who may not always be in the starting line-ups for their clubs, but praised the 24-year-old for being able to step up at international level.

'Even during those two years when he wasn't playing every week, he still did a good job when he came with the national team,' Hodgson said. 'Strangely in the last six months I have to choose less and less of these younger players who don't get a game in their starting line-ups for their teams because they seem to have broken into their starting line-ups, which I'm pleased about.

"The victim of a cannibal killer had 'lost faith in the justice system' in the months leading up to her death after failed attempts to have her former boyfriend released from prison. Cerys Yemm was brutally murdered by Matthew Williams, 34, on November 6, hours after the pair met in  Caerphilly, south Wales,and just two weeks after the killer had been freed from jail. In the months before her death, the 22-year-old had been campaigning for the release of her 'depressed' former boyfriend who was put behind bars for torching the couple's home. Cerys Yemm (left) had 'lost faith in the justice system' over failed attempts to have her former boyfriend freed from jail in the months before she was murdered by killer Matthew Williams (right) Chillingly, Miss Yemm told of how she had 'lost faith in the justice system' after repeated failed attempts to have Matthew Hayman freed. Last October tried to set their house in Abertillery alight by gassing himself with the cooker. The 27-year-old was jailed for three-and-a-half years by a judge who said he had endangered the lives of neighbours. Miss Yemm contested the sentence, claiming her former partner, who struggled with 'mental illness', had been trying to take his own life and not hurt others. In a comment posted beneath a court report of her boyfriend's sentencing in January, she wrote: 'It was because he has suffered with mental illness for many years from a young age, and was let down severely by the system, as he has never had help after numerous suicide attempts. 'All he done was try and end his life, if he had slit his wrists or overdosed he wouldn't be in prison now. (sic) 'I have lost all faith in (the) justice system as there is none!' Hayman's mother, Debra, has paid tribute to her son's former girlfriend. 'Cerys was lovely. I'm so upset. 'She and Mathew were lovely together,' the 49-year-old told the Sunday People. Miss Yemm was savagely murdered on Thursday after meeting Williams who, it has been claimed, had taken a dangerous concoction of mind-altering drugs before the attack. Forensic investigators at the scene in Caerphilly, south Wales, where cannibal killer Matthew Williams was Tasered and taken into police custody. He later died . Miss Yemm had only met her murderer hours beforehand during a night out in Caerphilly. The 22-year-old returned to the hostel where he was staying where staff discovered the grisly scene . Williams was a resident of Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Caerphilly, a bail hostel manned by security guards . The pair met hours before Williams convinced Miss Yemm, a shop owner, to return to his room at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel. There, hotel staff burst in on the criminal eating one of her eyeballs, having chewed off part of her face. He died in police custody after being Tasered. Williams had been  described as 'an infamous character' in his hometown of Blackwood with a reputation for violence. He had only just been released from prison after serving half of a five-year sentence for attacking former girlfriend Emma Thomas, 38, at her home before killing Miss Yemm. A review into whether or not Williams was properly monitored following his release from jail is to be carried out, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed. Such reviews are immediately launched if a serious offence is alleged to have happened within 30 days of a person leaving prison or is on licence. It will examine the circumstances of Miss Yemm’s death, the management of Williams following his release and whether steps can be taken to improve public protection. Politicians called for his case to be looked into upon the news of Miss Yemm's death. Hundreds of people have paid tribute to the 22-year-old  memorial pages have been set up on social media . Welsh Assembly member William Graham said: 'It is now clear that Mr Williams posed a risk to the public and I am extremely concerned that monitoring appears to have been deemed unnecessary. 'If true, a wider inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his release is urgently required. 'Questions must be answered by authorities and a full explanation provided on the decisions taken in this extremely tragic case.' It comes after tribute pages on social media websites set up in Miss Yemm's memory were hacked by 'sick' trolls who posted links to pornographic videos among comments. One 'community' page titled Cerys Marie Yemm directs mourners to a video with the comment: 'Video Tribute in Memory of Cerys Yemm. Rest in peace pretty girl.' But when friends have clicked on the link, they have been redirected to pornographic footage and, in some cases, asked to pay £24 to view it. Mourners have reported the footage to Facebook, with one writing: 'Who ever posted this video is as sick as the man who committed the hideous crime against this beautiful young girl, I’ve reported this video. 'I hope your found and prosecuted.' Another, Shelley Davis posted: 'I’ve tried the video and I’m getting porn whoever did this is a nasty sick saddo.' A video of Miss Yemm carrying out the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge for charity emerged today as hundreds of people shared tributes to the 22-year-old.

"Neil Warnock has lifted the lid on his exit from Crystal Palace, revealing that he spoke to Alan Pardew in the summer and told him to move to Selhurst Park. Speaking to Danny Kelly on talkSPORT's Sports Breakfast, Warnock told of Palace's trip to St James' Park in his first game as Eagles manager. 'You'll laugh at this but when we were at Newcastle, Alan was getting so much stick there,' Warnock said. 'I remember pulling him after the game and said, ""This is the club for you, your next club."" VIDEO Scroll down to hear Neil Warnock's first interview since Crystal Palace sacking . Neil Warnock was sacked as manager of Crystal Palace after a 3-1 loss to Southampton . Warnock says that he spoke to Alan Pardew in August to recommend he took the manager's job at Palace . 'Alan will know all the bits and bobs. He's a good manager and it's beneficial for everyone - Newcastle as well. It's great for him to go to London; I would have liked the chairman to tell me they had a chance of getting Alan Pardew and (ask) would I mind stepping down.' Warnock appeared happy at his current situation, admitting that he knew his tenancy at Crystal Palace was only temporary. His sacking, though, did come as a shock. 'It was really sudden, a phone call late on before I was leaving to go to QPR. The chairman just said it and it came as a shock. As things have panned out [with Pardew], it's not as much of a shock now. 'Ronnie Jepson, when I was clearing my desk, he said, ""Gaffer, they've got someone else."" 'I only wanted this season to help them stabilise when Tony [Pulis] left. There were no standout candidates. I said to the chairman then, ""You may as well put me in charge and then wait for a good candidate to come along"".' Palace drew 3-3 with Newcastle at St James' Park, after Wilfried Zaha scored a last-minute equaliser . Pardew has been widely criticised by the Newcastle supporters, but will now join a club where he is loved . A reason for Pulis' sudden departure, just two days before the start of the Premier League season, was transfer dealings - something which Pardew will now be tasked with in the January window. 'I think [Steve Parish] will [spend] with Alan, now. It's difficult to get your transfer targets. The problem is the chairman is trying to do everything. He's not got round to replacing Iain Moody so he's got a lot on his plate. Alan is a good manager who will take a lot off him. 'The fans are unbelievable, so in the fight for survival I think we'll have miles more than anyone else. I can even see them going as high as 11th or 12th... Palace are the best team in that bottom eight.' Warnock's sacking proved to be a decisive factor in kick-starting the managerial merry go-round this season. Alan Irvine has gone from West Brom, while Newcastle will also be searching for a new manager with Pardew heading south. Warnock took over from Tony Pulis, who left Crystal Palace two days before the start of the season . Steve Parish (left, pictured with Mark Bright - who played with Pardew at Palace) has appointed Pardew . The former Eagles man believes that Steve Bruce should take the job at St James' Park, while former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood is a perfect fit for West Brom. 'You've got to be in front as a manager, when's the right time? I looked at [Steve Bruce] last season and I thought, ""it can't happen again."" If he gets offered the chance at Newcastle, he'll have to take it. There's a time to move, and in Alan's case - and Steve's - the time is now. 'Sherwood fits the bill at West Brom too.' But what next for Warnock? He remains happy with the four-month job he did at Selhurst Park, but will there be another quick appointment for him? He is, in fact, second favourite with some bookmakers to take the vacant manager's job at Rangers. Alan Irvine (right) was the second manager to leave his post, after Warnock's sacking at Crystal Palace . Warnock feels Tim Sherwood, former Tottenham manager, would be a perfect fit at West Bromwich Albion . 'Oh, my goodness... that is great. I've watched seven episodes of Downton Abbey in the last few days - you miss out on things like that... things are not all doom and gloom. 'It was great to go back to Palace and I feel we can hold our heads up. We've given them a fighting chance, they've got a hell of a chance. 'I miss this [punditry], I had great time with you guys [talkSPORT] and BT Sport was great. I appreciated the opportunity to steady the ship [at Palace].

"Blame hormones, upbringing or plain old stereotyping, but there are some character traits that are always associated with either men or women. Acting on intuition, sobbing your heart out at a weepy film or thinking through a problem from someone else's point of view are all traditionally feminine tendencies. Angry outbursts and a pathological inability to ask for directions, even when lost, are most definitely linked to the male brain. But far from just being crass gender generalisations, it now seems that there is solid science behind the different ways in which the sexes behave. Women have more brain cells in the pre-frontal cortex, the area which controls planning and conscientiousness, which is why they are better at packing carefully . After studying nearly 80,000 brain scans and analysing numerous research papers, my work as a neuroscientist has helped find scientific proof that male and female brains are fundamentally different. Huge advances in brain scanning mean that scientists are now able get an incredibly clear picture of which parts of the brain light up when we do certain things. This has helped prove that the differences between our brains can explain our behaviour in a multitude of ways. Men and women are equally smart, but each sex uses different parts of the brain to solve problems or achieve goals. So, what is really happening inside our heads? SIZE MATTERS . Studies show that men's brains are between eight and ten per cent larger than women's, and even if you adjust for body weight male brains contain around four per cent more brain cells than female brains. But this doesn't mean that men are brighter. In fact, brain scans show that some very important parts of the female brain are larger than the corresponding part of a man's. This has big implications for the different ways men and women typically behave. Women behave differently to men because their brains are wired completely uniquely . If you've ever wondered why it's so often the woman who organises and usually packs for a family holiday, it's because women have more brain cells in the pre-frontal cortex - the area of the brain which controls judgement, planning, and conscientiousness. This is also the part of the brain that governs impulse control, which may explain why women tend to think before they leap - sometimes not leaping at all - while men are more inclined to jump in and think about it later. One reason men can be more volatile and swift to anger in a crisis is that the part of their brain, the amygdala, which processes fear and anger, is much larger than a woman's. Luckily, they have fewer brain cells in the major memory centre of the brain, which means any outburst is quickly forgotten - by them, at least. Good spatial awareness is also widely regarded to be a male thing  and for good reason. Boys are born with larger parietal lobes, which deal with perception of the physical world around them. It is probably no surprise to learn that men have more brain cells in the hypothalamus, too - the part of the brain which focuses on sexual behaviour. One reason men can be more volatile and swift to anger in a crisis is that the part of their brain, the amygdala, which processes fear and anger, is much larger than a woman's . MULTI-TASKING MINDS . The human brain is made up of grey matter (brain cells) that does the thinking, and white matter (the communication cables between brain cells), which connects different bits of the brain. Studies now show that grey and white matter are differently distributed in men and women, which has massive implications for the way we behave. Because men have more grey matter in the bit of the brain that governs intelligence, they are inclined to tackle a task with single-minded focus, not taking into account the peripheral issues which a woman might consider to be important. Women have more white matter in the part of the brain that governs intelligence. This means chatter goes on between different parts of the brain, which is why when women tackle a problem, they draw on many areas at the same time. Science proves that women have far more cells in the part of the brain that controls empathy, which explains why they cry more often in sad movies . FEMININE INSTINCT . There is something unique about the structure and functioning of the female brain which gives women a distinct advantage when it comes to intuition. Scans show that when women are thinking, they dip into the right side of the brain, which specialises in emotional issues. This makes women much better at picking up on cues, such as body language or tone of voice, that men may miss. Scans confirm that women have larger areas in the brain dedicated to tracking gut feelings, which is why they're quicker at working out what others are thinking and reach conclusions based on hunches. Intuition does have its downside, though. Scans show that this sense can be seriously compromised by lack of sleep, hormones, stress, illness and blood sugar dips. Men and women are equally smart, but each sex uses different parts of the brain to solve problems or achieve goals . I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL . If you blubbed through Les Miserables while your husband remained unmoved, it's not his fault. Science proves that women have far more cells in the part of the brain that controls empathy. This means they can put themselves in someone else's shoes and get much closer to actually feeling their fear, pain and joy. While men and women both have brain cells called mirror neurons, activated when they empathise with other people, women have more grey matter in the areas of the brain where the mirror neuron systems are found - hence the sniffling when faced with a sobbing Anne Hathaway. The office is another area where innate gender differences are starkly displayed. Ever wondered why a male boss will push on with an unpopular meeting, even when the mood has turned frosty? That's because the male pattern of brain activity dictates that they focus on problem solving, and are less concerned about the emotional cohesion of a group. Women have a tendency to be more sensitive to the emotional climate. They will be subconsciously firing up the empathy regions of their brains to work out what other people in the room are thinking. Dr Daniel G. Amen, left, has written a new book, right, explaining the differences between the brains of men and women which lead us to behave in different ways . IT'S UNDER CONTROL . The area of the brain which deals with anger and aggression - that all-important pre-frontal cortex - tends to be larger in women than men, which means women find it easier to keep strong negative emotions in check. Brain scans also show that when a woman is feeling aggressive, she's much more likely to launch a verbal attack - using the highly active language part of her brain - than a physical one. WOMEN WORRIERS . Men and women tend to worry in different ways, too. Women's associative thinking powers kick in, making one niggling concern quickly connect with others to create a seething mass of stress. Furthermore, women generally have lower levels of the brain chemical serotonin than men, and low levels are normally associated with over-activity in the brain's worry centres. Bathed in comfortably high serotonin levels, a man's worries will be compartmentalised into one small, defined area. Extracted from Unleash The Power Of The Female Brain by Daniel G.

"Swansea manager Garry Monk believes Jonjo Shelvey should not face disciplinary action after appearing to catch Liverpool defender Emre Can in the face with a stray elbow on Monday night. Shelvey caught Can in the side of the head during the first half of Swansea's 4-1 Barclays Premier League defeat at Liverpool and, although the incident went unpunished at the time, the Swansea midfielder could face retrospective action from the FA if referee Andre Marriner highlights it in his match report. Monk said after the game he had yet to view the incident properly, but he defended his player on Tuesday morning after seeing footage of it on the team bus on the way home from Liverpool. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Jonjop Shelvey was caught on camera flinging an elbow towards Emre Can during the first half at Anfield . Shelvey catches the Liverpool midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism . The 22-year-old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at Anfield . 'There was a motion towards the player, but it's not clear,' Monk said at his press conference ahead of the Swans' trip to QPR on New Year's Day. 'I spoke to Jonjo on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all. 'He said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away from him to move it. 'I don't think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed. 'No-one had a better view of the incident than him. He felt it didn't warrant any more action and the game went on. 'There were no complaints from any of the players afterwards, so you have to trust the referee made the right decision - and we thought that he did.' Shelvey (left) had another evening to forget as Swansea lost 4-1 to Liverpool . The former Reds star leaves the pitch after scoring an own goal and courting controversy with an elbow . Shelvey is likely to come under scrutiny after being seen joking with Adam Lallana during the match . Liverpool's England forward Raheem Sterling faces a similar anxious wait to see if he could also be punished after tangling with Swansea's Argentina central defender Federico Fernandez during the closing stages of the match. The 20-year-old slapped Fernandez in the face, but Reds boss Brendan Rodgers said after the game that the referee dealt with both situations sensibly and did not expect either Sterling or Shelvey to face FA action. Monk agreed with Rodgers' assessment of both incidents and said Sterling did not deserve a red card for raising his arm to Fernandez. 'It's the same situation,' Monk said. 'Yes, there is a motion towards Federico's face, but for me the referee and the linesman were the best placed people to see. 'The referee looked straight at it and decided it didn't warrant any action. 'Does it warrant a sending off? Not for me, but again you have to trust that the referee's in the right place and doing the right thing.' Liverpool's Raheem Sterling (right) swung an arm towards the face of Federico Fernandez (left) on Monday . The incident came during the closing stages of Liverpool's 4-1 Premier League win against Swansea . Swansea's heaviest defeat of 2014 saw Liverpool leapfrog them into eighth place in the midst of what has been a heavy festive programme for Monk's men, who have already had trips to Hull and Anfield and must now visit Loftus Road and then Saturday's third-round FA Cup opponents Tranmere in the space of 48 hours. 'In terms of preparation, it's difficult,' Monk said. 'It's nice to have a week's build-up to get more details into the players, but I've played in these periods and I love the quick turnover of games. 'I think players do enjoy it and they're used to it in this country. 'But physically it is difficult to churn out top-level performances in such a short space of time. 'There's a higher risk of injuries at this level, with the intensity and the physicality of games, but that's the challenge for all of us. 'We've got to deal with it, and the medical staff have put programmes in place for the players for their recovery.'","Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey appeared to elbow Emre Can .

"Manchester United's frantic rebuilding programme to patch up the inadequate squad left by Sir Alex Ferguson has been a major factor in propelling Premier League spending to record levels for a summer window. The combined outlay for the 20 clubs stood at £755.9million, even before United's £14m deal to buy Daley Blind from Ajax, subject to medical and personal terms, was announced. Of that, £570m has gone overseas, with Spain alone receiving £238.7m. The arrival of Blind will take United's summer spree to almost £150m and sets up a tantalising question with just a few dozen hours of this window remaining. Will this be a £1billion window? SCROLL DOWN FOR SIMON JONES' CLUB-BY-CLUB GUIDE . Record: Manchester United paid £60million to bring Angel di Maria to Old Trafford from Real Madrid . Bow: Di Maria made his United debut in the goalless draw at Burnley on Saturday . Is it possible that these clubs from just one division can spend an average of £50m apiece in one transfer period? And that does include at least the equivalent commitment in wages to the new players. Already last summer's Premier League record spend of £630m for one transfer window has been smashed. Based on last year's activity, it is possible that the total on the Sunday morning before the window closes can leap by about a quarter when the window shuts. Last summer £507m turned to £630m at the close of business. The same percentage rise will see the £1bn figure pushed close. Conditions this time are even more amenable to a late splurge, as United and their major rivals bolster their squads in the hope that they will be good enough for top-four finishes - and lucrative Champions League football - or even genuine title tilts. Big bucks: Chile international Alexis Sanchez left Barcelona to join Arsenal in a £30million deal . Decisive: Sanchez celebrates a crucial goal against Besiktas in the Champions League play-off round . The rest of the division are also spending because they need strength in depth to try to stay in the division - and remain on the gravy train. That is why United splashed a British record fee of £59.7m on Angel Di Maria, why Chelsea bought Diego Costa and Arsenal bought Alexis Sanchez for £32m each - and why all three clubs will remain in the market before the window closes. Southampton have splashed out £12m for Shane Long, and West Ham have paid the same for Enner Valencia. Everton broke their own record to buy £28m Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea while Leicester spent £8m on Leonardo Ulloa. Arrivals: £20m defender Dejan Lovren is one of many new Liverpool signings this summer . Shift: Lovren moved to Anfield from Southampton, along with Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert . Splashing the cash: Even despite FFP restrictions, Manchester City paid Porto £32m for Eliaquim Mangala . West Bromwich manager Alan Irvine said: 'Fees are extremely high. We started with a budget that looked good, and very quickly it looked a small budget. Clearly, there have been huge fees paid for players, huge demands by those players and agents' fees have been considerable.' Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, attributes the rise in spending to a number of factors. They include 'the showcase for talent a World Cup provides' and the fact that each Premier League club received on average £25m more central TV cash in 2013-14 than they did the season before. Clinical: Chelsea signed Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid in a deal worth £32million . Off and running: Costa has scored four goals in his first three games for Jose Mourinho's side . But while a number of World Cup stars from the Brazil 2014 tournament have come to England, including Di Maria, Costa and Sanchez, history shows that there is nothing about a World Cup year that boosts spending. In 2010, summer trade to Premier League clubs was substantially down (£365m) on 2009 (£450m). And in 2006 it was only very marginally up on 2005. Jones's calculations on TV cash also don't tell the full story: each club received on average an extra £28m in central Premier League funds in 2013-14, or £78m against £50m, with £26m of this extra being TV cash. The big clubs saw bigger leaps; Liverpool's TV money went up by £43m to £97.5m, Manchester City's was up by £38.5m to £96.6m, Chelsea's was up £39.1m to £94.1m, and clubs like Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle, Southampton and Stoke saw rises of £30m. Ultimately, like so many things now in elite football, it comes down to money. The clubs have the cash, and they spend it in the hope (or fear) that they can do better - and avoid failure. Familiar face: Romelu Lukaku joined Everton for £28m from Chelsea this summer . Return: Lukaku spent last season on loan at Goodison Park and this summer agreed a permanent switch .","Premier League spending already over £750million this summer .

The . film is the latest collaboration between the 27-year-old Pirates Of The . Caribbean star and director Joe Wright, a partnership that has resulted . in Baftas and Oscar nominations for Pride & Prejudice and . Atonement. Original plans were for a period adaptation shot on location in Russia. Then, just 12 weeks before filming, Wright made an audacious U-turn. 'It . was pretty radical,' says Knightley. 'We were going to St Petersburg . and Moscow. Then all of a sudden I got a call from Joe asking, ""Can you . come round here please?"" 'I . live round the corner from him so he took me into his office and . explained, ""There’s been a bit of a change of plan.""

Anna Karenina, the story of an . aristocratic wife and mother in 19th-century Russia who embarks on an . all-consuming affair, is a largely British production. Knightley is . joined by Jude Law (unrecognisable as her elder-statesman husband . Karenin) and Aaron Johnson (her passionate young lover Count Vronsky), . while the film is produced by Tim Bevan of Working Title. Jude Law's looks had to be disguised for the role of Karenin, while his costume was inspired by Tsar Alexander II . 'I've watched Keira mature as an actor,' says Joe Wright . Original plans were for a period adaptation shot on location in Russia. Then, just 12 weeks before filming, Joe Wright made an audacious U-turn . Sir Tom Stoppard was wooed to write the screenplay by the combination of Knightley and Tolstoy. 'You need a clever actress to play Anna Karenina and Keira has very good instincts,' says the 75-year-old playwright. 'And she is extraordinarily beautiful.' The result is a radical cinematic conceit that may divide critics. 'What's the point of doing a safe adaptation?' asks Knightley. 'If you're going out you might as well go out with a bang.' In one scene, the theatre is transformed into a frozen lake . A key scene is a horse race for which the floor of director Joe Wright's 'magical theatre' is turned into a paddock .

Officers from the New South Wales Police Dog Unit posted the adorable photos of the tiny criminal on their Facebook page. The koala was spotted running in and out of traffic in Campbelltown, in south-west Sydney, at about 2am on Sunday morning by Senior Constable Barry. Scroll down for video . 'SC Barry stopped and spoke to the Koala about the dangers of running across the lanes of traffic,' the Facebook post read. 'SC Barry had to issue a move along direction to the Koala for hindering traffic! 'After failing to comply and 'move along' numerous warnings were issued and the Koala failed to comply and [Campbelltown police] attended and a short foot pursuit occurred and the Koala was eventually arrested and placed for safety in a police vehicle.' In the photos posted on the social networking site the furry marsupial can be seen in the back of the paddy wagon next to a pair of handcuffs. Inspector Adam Johnson, commander of the NSW Dog Unit, said one of his officers was out patrolling with his two dogs when he spotted the koala on the road. 'If he hadn't have jumped out and grabbed it the koala probably would have been run over,' Mr Johnson said. 'He called for one of the local units to come down and they put the koala in the back cage just while they contacted the RSPCA to check what to do. 'They've just taken those photos with the handcuffs as a bit of humour - a lot of policing's always serious so it's good to have a light-hearted moment.' The RSPCA advised the police to release the koala in a 'suitable location' away from the Campbelltown traffic. 'The Koala was last seen decamping from the Police Vehicle leaving the handcuffs behind,' the Facebook post read. The pictures have received more than 2000 likes and hundreds of comments. 'I love it when the stories are good ones it's a nice break for you guys. Naughty koala I hope he didn't resist arrest,' Finoa Termytelen wrote. 'That is so cute glad they helped him out,' Lisa Owens wrote.

"Plans have been unveiled to create a new £39billion airport for London - in the middle of the Channel. Engineers unveiled the proposals for a four runway airport, which would ease pressure on the South East's overburdened runways, on a man-made island 1.8 miles off the coast of Kent on underwater banks known as Goodwin Sands. Construction firm Beckett Rankine are touting the site as the answer to London's need for a new hub airport. Proposals: Engineers have unveiled ambitious plans to create this £39 . billion airport for London - in the middle of the Channel . Modern: The plans feature a state-of-the-art terminal building and four runways . The plans feature a state-of-the-art terminal building and runways connected to London by a high-speed underground rail link. The hazardous sands are said to the perfect location as there pose no environmental, economical or social risk. The four runways will sit 1.5km apart so that they can operate independently and taking off and landing over water rather not an urban area will allow 24-hour flights. No homes will have to be demolished and developers say there would be no concerns of damage to conservation or wildlife. Beckett Rankine director Tim Beckett  said the proposal was the most 'sustainable solution' yet to be put forward. He said: 'We believe that an offshore hub airport is the only option that can realistically provide the four new, independent runways that research reveals London needs. Terminal: The airport blueprint is the latest option put forward that could solve the UK's aviation problems . 'If the Davies Commission endorses the long-term requirement for a new, four runway hub airport for London, then locating it at Goodwin will have the least adverse social and environmental impact of any option. 'It is certainly the most sustainable solution available. 'Creating a new airport for London presents a major regenerative opportunity. 'We believe that East Kent is an area that could benefit most from the boost of new jobs and economic uplift. Links: The airport would have a high speed rail line direct to London . 'The location of an airport offshore is an alternative that crowded island nation's are turning to across the globe. 'It is the solution recently adopted at South Korea's new Incheon Airport and at Kansai Airport in Japan and in Hong Kong.' It is not the first time that developers have mooted plans for an airport in the Thames Estuary, with other proposals including designs for a runway at the Isle of Grain. But the latest developers say that other sites have 'significant disadvantages' compared to their project. Options: Boris Johnson's preferred choice is 'London Britannia Airport' but he may also consider Stansted expansion and now a third option in . the Channel . Mr Beckett added: 'Each proposal is located in at least one internationally designated, environmentally sensitive area. 'All the sites either interfere with shipping lanes or else are too small to provide four runways sufficiently spaced for independent operation.' The proposed site is within UK territorial waters and would be owned by the Crown Estate. Passengers from the airport could be in London within 40 minutes thanks to the rail link which would connect up with the current HS1 line, with further connections to Europe planned via Eurostar. Two major roads, the A2 and M20, lead to the site. Although London Mayor Boris Johnson has already openly backed a bid for the 'London Britannia Airport' - Norman Foster's designs for an island airport also in the Thames Estuary - his advisor Daniel Moylan said he had been encouraged by the new designs. He said: 'The Mayor has been encouraging proposals for a new airport to the east of London. 'This proposal is welcome as a contribution to a critical national debate and as a demonstration that a new airport is feasible and deliverable. 'The arguments for the construction of a new hub airport in the UK are overwhelming and this proposal offers one option of how to build it. 'We now urgently need to recognise that a new hub airport is the answer to our aviation capacity problems and press ahead with considering the best way to deliver that airport.' Plans for Norman Foster's airport on an island in the Thames were unveiled in September this year and include four floating runways tethered to the river bed. Vision: This is what Stansted Airport could look like it it was turned into a four-runway superhub . Plans: How Stansted would look on the map if it was extended . Plans to extend Britain's busiest airport Heathrow were put forward in the same month as part of the government's review into airport expansion in the South East. Earlier this week Boris Johnson put the idea of expanding Stansted back on the table as a way of solving the UK's aviation headache as he fights tooth and nail to block the Heathrow expansion. Though London Britannia is undoubtedly his current first choice, it is understood he will now order a £3million detailed feasibility study to consider if 'compromise option' Stansted could cope if transformed. A high speed rail link would also be built cutting journey time to London from the Essex site to just 25 minutes. Proposed location: The airport will be built 1.8miles off the coast of Kent on underwater banks known as Goodwin Sands . Plans: Lord Foster's £50billion design for Boris Island that would sit in the Thames estuary and handle 150 million passengers a year . If suitable, Stansted's growth could be put at the heart of the Conservative's 2015 general election manifesto as a fall-back from Boris Island and building a third runway at Heathrow. But it will still be highly controversial as proposals for a second runway there have already led to years of protests from people living under its flighpath. Stansted has been targeted by many protests including one where more than 50 people burst onto its runway and shut it down for more than five hours. Transport experts fear Britain could miss out on crucial revenue from tourists and flight taxes if major carriers move their European base to rivals on the continent.","Beckett Rankine unveiled the proposals for the four-runway airport today .

"The scores of Manchester United fans heading back to London by train on Sunday evening forced QPR to travel 194 miles by coach after their 4-0 thrashing at Old Trafford, joked Harry Redknapp. So the QPR manager might have been a tad jealous of his son's method of transport for the day.

The duo were among the guests of Amit Bhatia, the QPR co-owner and businessman, who is married to the daughter of billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, and both looked to be enjoying the ride in a series of pictures shared by the former England cricket captain. Pietersen is a self-confessed 'plastic Chelsea fan' but is friends with Bhatia. Spirits were still in the sky when the party landed in Manchester, with Bhatia saying on Twitter: 'Arrived in Manchester to watch QPR vs Man Utd. Excited for today, come on urrrsssss. If we get a point #drinksonme.' While Redknapp left the party to concentrate on his professional duties for the match, Pietersen enjoyed a meal with Bhatia's friends, which was finished off with a shot a tequila. England's all-time top runscorer  posted a picture of the toast with the conclusion: '#messy'. But by the end of the game, in which goals from Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata secured Louis van Gaal's first victory as United boss, QPR hopes had been brought back down to earth.

"It's the Aussie workplace that employees can't get enough of, with all-day nerf gun wars, midnight movie sessions, unlimited food, office pets and a basketball court. The Townsville office is set to expand, with an exciting new Sydney office in the works which promises to be even more exciting. 'We're coming to Sydney to take on Google as one of the best places to work in Australia,' promises Luke Anear, the CEO of SafetyCulture. The ten-year-old software development company started out in a garage, but 15 months ago moved into their incredible 1000 square-metre, multi-level complex. Scroll down for video . The Townsville office boasts a basketball court, which is used to release tension and for team bonding . The SafetyCulture office gets daily deliveries from the supermarket to fully equip the kitchen with a range of foods, to ensure the team has 'unlimited food' The company is growing rapidly, with some of the world's top international engineers flocking to north Queensland to work with SafetyCulture. This year, 21 new employees started with the company in just ten weeks, thanks to the appeal of a happy workplace that is focussed on the well-being of the staff. 'We've got a culture that says that we value people,' Mr Anear told Daily Mail Australia. 'The number one thing is that we’re here to take care of and support our employees. 'Plus, it's amazing how a clash of visions can be resolved over a Ping-Pong table!' The office is a hub of innovation, which Mr Anear says translates to inspired work from the employees. The pet-friendly office boasts a basketball court, 75-seat movie theatre, stand up desks, kitchen with unlimited supplies and even a 'chill out' room, fitted with sleeping bags. The office pup! The SafetyCulture office is pet-friendly, with dogs particularly praised for their ability to relieve office tension . 'Having some down time is just as important, particularly the type of work we do where we work unusual hours because we provide 24 hour support for clients,' said Mr Anear. 'It’s a pet-friendly place. Dogs are a particularly good de-stresser, it can be relief in a tense moment when they come up for a pat.' Mr Anear says that his investment in his employees' happiness is invaluable, and he is 'part of a trend that companies need to take'. 'With a compelling culture it feels like engineers can do their best work,' he explained. 'It's better than the traditional corporate environment where you work in a pale-coloured office and if you've got a window, you're lucky!' Games and competitions lifts the mood in the SafetyCulture office, helping the individuals to enjoy their workplace and boosting team morale. CEO Luke Anear is always looking for new ways to make the office a more enjoyable place for employees . Standing desks, which can also be converted into sitting desks, have been found to increase the employees' energy levels and improve concentration . Every new employee is initiated with their own nerf gun. 'The nerf guns are a big thing, we have on-going battles. 'It’s a team fun environment and we often have team nerf wars from one end of the building to the other. 'People often shoot each other while they're working, so then the person waiting for the opportunity to retaliate when the other person least expects it throughout the day.' 'It all that adds to the light-heartedness and keeps us on our toes!' As CEO, Mr Anear says it's incredibly important that he also partakes in the fun. 'Having the boss involved can be a positive thing,' said Mr Anear. 'It helps me maintain a rapport and interact with different staff and it’s key to have the person at the top involved.' 'I certainly cop my fair share of nerf bullets!' The team is shown during an international Skype conference call. The office chooses to use stimulating bright colours, instead of the usual boring, pale office decor - including the use of an Anchorman movie poster! He insists that the antics make employees more productive, rather than serving as a distraction. 'When the business is busy and we don’t play games as much, everyone feels it, the energy tightens up – it turns into a normal work place!' he said. 'The activities help to maintain a good feeling.' 'Without them, tension in workplaces build up over time. People can get burnt out or jaded with the work they’re doing.' The Townsville team is growing quickly and a Sydney branch will open next month in inner city Surry Hills . Mr Anear says that the theory is inspired by scientific research into employee happiness and productivity. 'The company needs to be healthy and productive - you’ve got to strike that balance.' 'Science is behind our approach but the art is in finding balance.' Young university interns are the only people that may take 'playtime' a little too far. ‘We only have to put our foot down with some of the uni interns,' Mr Anear explains with a laugh. 'We have nine interns who come from uni, see all these nerf guns and great facilities and they tend to lack a bit of discretion in finding balance’  he said. ‘So it’s really just with them that we need to make a bit of a rule book!' The CEO insists that the approach increases the office's productivity, rather than distracting employees. 'It is all about having the right balance' The activities, as well as the use of 'stand up desks', are found to result in heightened concentration and energy levels, according to the SafetyCulture CEO. 'The stand up desks increase the amount of oxygen flowing through to keep your body moving,' said Anear. 'It helps you to stay alert, youdon’t hit the wall like you mostly do in a normal office.' With the help of a quick basketball, chess or Ping-Pong game, the team can avoid the dreaded 'three-thirtyitis' Everybody has reported positive benefits from it in that regard; everybody has felt that they can concentrate better . 'I feel more alert, and can think clearly without the lull or any daydreaming. 'And the threat of a nerf gun keeps everybody on their toes!' SafetyCulture will start a Sydney engineering team in Surry Hills in December, and are looking for new ways to 'raise the bar.' 'We're always looking for new ways to make sure more fun is being had at work. 'We have fun and do great work.' With the help of a quick basketball, chess or Ping-Pong game, as well as stand up desks, the team can avoid the dreaded 'three-thirtyitis'","This 15-month-old office could be one of Australia's most fun workplaces .

"Shakhtar Donetsk's win over Illychivets this weekend was routine, but Shakhtar striker Luiz Adriano will do well to remember it after a brutal clothesline left him out cold. In a move more commonly seen in the wrestling ring, Illychivets's Oleksandr Chizhov was challenging for a 50/50 ball with Adriano, when his flailing arm caught the face of the Shakhtar forward and left him unconscious on the turf. Immediately after the incident, Chizhov is seen desperately calling for medical attention when he realises Adriano is unconscious. The referee deemed the incident a yellow-card offence, despite the fact Adriano would have been clear on goal had he gone past Chizhov. Shakhtar doctors shortly after decided that Adriano was unfit to carry on, and the striker was substituted directly after the incident. Shakhtar, who were 1-0 up at the time of the knock-out blow, went on to win 3-0 and maintained their 100% win record in the Ukrainian Premier League this season, scoring 13 and only conceding 1 goal. Ouch: Adriano, after beating Chizhov to the ball, is caught by the Ukrainian's right arm . Clothesline: Adriano would have been through on goal had he not been hit .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's local petting farm has banned photos on the premises to ensure the privacy of royal visitors, it is claimed. Prince George, one, and his mother are said to regularly visit the animals at Bucklebury Farm, near Reading, Berkshire, which is close to Duchess's parents' home, Bucklebury Manor. Now staff at the petting zoo have put signs up banning visitors from taking 'unauthorised photographs ... of other guests,' reports The Sun. Scroll down for video . Please, no pictures: Bucklebury Farm Park, the location of Prince George's favourite petting zoo, has banned visitors from taking photographs of other visitors in an effort to ensure the privacy of the heir to the throne . It comes after armed close-protection police surrounded a family after their car broke down on the way to Bucklebury Farm for fear they might be terrorists with a royal target. Set in 77 acres of Berkshire countryside, Bucklebury Farm Park offers deer watching, nature walks, indoor play and tractor rides, as well as the petting zoo. It is highly rated on comparison websites, but locals were not impressed with the farm management's intervention with one telling The Sun's Emily Andrews it felt like an 'overreaction'. 'Every photo we take there, even of our own children, could unwittingly capture other people and their kids,' said the local. 'I took my daughter there the other day and saw Kate's mother with George and his nanny. I thought about taking a photo and decided not to. 'But protection officers still came over to us and challenged us. They were quite difficult about it.' Very important persons: Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge pictured with their son Prince George in April. She now has to deal with looking after a tireless one-year-old while pregnant . Popular attraction: Set in 77 acres of Berkshire countryside, Bucklebury Farm Park offers deer watching, nature walks, indoor play and tractor rides, as well as the petting zoo . The attraction describes itself as a family-friendly day out with deer safaris, nature trails and farm animals on the 77-acre site. Animals include reindeer, llamas, pygmy goats, donkeys, chickens, ponies, cattle, wild boar and even a 'guinea pig village'. Older children can also pan for gold, hitch a ride on the zip wire, drive a go-kart, climb a lookout tower or just stay in the playground. The farm hosts a gold birthday party package including a hot dog and chips meal - though cuddly piglets from the gift shop cost extra. Last month it emerged the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, had taken refuge with her parents in Bucklebury, while 'struggling terribly' with debilitating antenatal sickness. Sources said the Duchess 'hasn't been at all well' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers. The whole area has since been subject to massively tightened security, as one family found out when their car broke down on the way to a day out at Bucklebury Farm. Adam De Marco, 40, his partner Claire Lennon, 39, and their daughter Mia, seven, were on a family day out in Bucklebury, near Newbury, Berkshire, when their BMW's tyre punctured. Their stricken vehicle quickly attracted the attention of royal minders, who ordered them out of the car, they said. But the security men put away their guns when they realised what had happened. The family say they later spotted Kate, her mother Carole Middleton and Prince George at the nearby farm. Adam De Marco, 40, his partner Claire Lennon, 39, and their daughter Mia, seven, were on a family day out in Bucklebury, near Newbury, Berkshire, when their BMW's tyre punctured and they were surrounded by police . Mrs Middleton has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures, such as herbal tea, on the internet. And despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton has also been taking George off her daughter's hands. She has been seen in local shops with her 15-month-old grandson, prompting one startled assistant to write on Twitter: 'Served Kate Middleton's mum and Prince George today at work. He is gorgeous!' The Duchess says she feels far more relaxed at the Middleton family's £5million Georgian mansion, Bucklebury Manor, than at Kensington Palace. One source told the Mail: 'Kate is feeling so lousy that she just wanted to be with her family and out of public view. 'She is extremely close to Carole, who is very much a hands-on grandmother. Between her and their nanny, Maria, Kate has all the help she needs with George while she is feeling so sick. 'And Bucklebury is somewhere she can just relax and be herself.' Elizabeth Hartley Russell, whose family owns the Bucklebury Estate, told MailOnline the policy was a 'moral issue' to protect children's privacy and was brought in after the Leveson inquiry. She said: 'It's not been done to protect any individual - it's been done to protect the rights of children. 'We're a family farm park. We're not here for people to take pictures of other people and put them on Twitter and Facebook. 'We've had children of actors, TV presenters and politicians. All sorts of people have come to visit the farm over a period, as they have to other family attractions. We're not alone in this. 'It's been a long-standing policy that we've had, and it's something we feel very strongly about.' She added in an e-mail statement: 'This is something of a storm in a tea cup, as our polite request is purely for no unauthorised photographs of other guests not a blanket ban on photography. 'Nor has it been done in relation to any one individual. Like any operator of a family visitor attraction, we are acutely conscious of the rights of the child – any child – to enjoy the freedom and privacy afforded by family days out at venues such as ours. 'The joy of special family moments such as these must be something that all parents and carers identify with and cherish.'","Prince George is said to regularly visit the animals at Bucklebury Farm .

"Police have released the name of the man who allegedly armed himself with a knife on Saturday and took a delicatessen manager hostage before police shot him dead. Brendan John Lindsay, 38, entered The Lunch Club delicatessen in Carlisle, Perth and grabbed a knife from behind the counter on Saturday morning. He then took the store manager, known by locals as Sheila, outside and held the blade to her throat, while threatening to kill her. Sheila, 37, suffered stab wounds to her neck and was also hit in the leg with a bullet during the incident while Lindsay was shot dead by officers at the scene.

Tottenham and Liverpool have been heavily linked with the England Under 21 striker, but neither have registered an interest with his Midlands club. Talks over a new, improved contract following his impressive start to the season have been curtailed as Berahino looks to regain his starting role. West Brom forward Saido Berahino has been linked with Premier League duo Tottenham and Liverpool . Berahino has scored eight goals in 20 games for the Baggies so far this season . He has started the last three games on the bench after suffering a dip in form following a start to the campaign where he scored seven Premier League goals before November. Irvine predicted Berahino would stay at The Hawthorns after the January window closes. ‘At the moment it is certainly only speculation. We have had no enquiries whatsoever,’ he said. ‘Where the stories have come from I’m not quite sure. January will reveal what is going to happen. ‘We may well get some offers for Saido and if we do the club will deal with them. ‘The chairman has already said he doesn’t want to sell Saido in January so I’m guessing nothing has changed as far as that is concerned.’ Alan Irvine remains adamant Berahino will not be sold during the January transfer window .","Saido Berahino has been linked with a move to Liverpool and Tottenham .

"An American photographer has been crowned Wildlife Photographer of the Year for his black-and-white image of the king of the jungle. Michael ‘Nick’ Nichols’ photograph of a pride of lions beat more than 42,000 entries to win the accolade, while incredible images of embracing toads, lightening and a sunbathing scorpion also won awards. The winners received their awards at The Natural History Museum in London, from its patron, The Duchess of Cambridge, Sir David Attenborough, wildlife presenter Liz Bonnin and renowned wildlife photographer Frans Lanting. Michael ‘Nick’ Nichols’ photograph of a pride of lazing lions beat more than 42,000 entries to win the accolade, while incredible images of embracing toads, lightning and a sunbathing scorpion also won awards. He followed the pride for six months so they got used to his presence, before photographing them in infra-red to capture a 'primal' and 'biblical' moment . Mr Nichols became the 50th photographer to win the main title, for his serene black-and-white image of lions resting with their cubs in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park. To get the winning shot, he followed the pride for nearly six months so they became used to his presence as he photographed them in infra-red. He said the technique ‘transforms the light and turns the moment into something primal, biblical almost’. Eight-year-old Carlos Perez Naval was awarded Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2014 for his image of a scorpion soaking up the Sun near his hometown in Spain. The afternoon Sun was casting such a lovely glow over the scene that Carlos decided to experiment with a double exposure for the first time so he could include it. The judges said that his image displays expertise beyond his years . Anton Lilja, from Sweden, photographed a male frog in the moment of fertilising a female’s mass of eggs to win the 15 to 17 Years category. The title of the image is 'the long embrace'.  A male frog grasps his mate in a tight embrace, known as amplexus. Amplexus often lasts for days, with the male holding onto the female until it has laid her eggs . Mr Nichols set out to create an image that would express both the essence of lions and how we see them - a picture of a time past, before lions were under such threat. His photograph shows five females of the Vumbi pride – a ‘formidable and spectacularly co-operative team’ – resting with their cubs on a rocky outcrop. Shortly before he took the shot, they had attacked and driven off one of the two pride males, before lying close together to take a nap. Jim Brandenburg, acclaimed wildlife photographer and chair of the judging panel, said: ‘Nick’s image encapsulated so many elements that demonstrated artistic and technical skill, the sort that takes many years of professional work to hone and craft as he has done’. The winners received their awards at The Natural History Museum in London, from its patron, The Duchess of Cambridge, Sir David Attenborough, wildlife presenter Liz Bonnin and renowned wildlife photographer Frans Lanting. Francisco Negroni from Chile won the Earth's Environments prize for photographing the lightning near an erupting volcano . Rodrigo Friscone Wyssmann came across this grim sight off Magdalena Bay off the coast of Mexico. His image shows a young great white shark killed by a hook. He said: 'Great whites are amazing, graceful and highly intelligent creatures. It was such a sad scene I changed the image to black and white, which felt more dignified . Relaxing at the end of his Costa Rican family holiday, Will Jenkins photographed a metre-long green iguana that jumped down from the hotel roof. For it, he was named a finalist in the 11-14 years category. He said: ' The iguana sunbathed for about 20 minutes before heading to the beach. It made me realise you should always have your camera with you, just in case' Eight-year-old Carlos Perez Naval was awarded Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2014 for his image of a scorpion soaking up the Sun near his hometown in Spain. The photograph was taken at dusk and shows the scorpion flourishing its sting as a warning to the young photographer, who had found it basking on a flat stone in a rocky area near his home in Torralba de los Sisones, northeast Spain. The late afternoon light was casting such a lovely glow over the scene that Carlos decided to experiment with his first ever double exposure to include the sun. Jan van der Greef, of the Netherlands, was declared finalist of the birds group. He captured the sword-billed hummingbird - the only bird with a bill longer than its body - on a trip to Ecuador. His image shows the green sword-billed bird facing off a territorial inca hummingbird that was after nectar from flowers. The image is simply called 'touche' Bruno D'Amicis, from Italy, found a teenager selling a three-month-old fennec fox in southern Tunisia and photographed the emotive scene to win the 'world in our hands' category. He said that while the practice is illegal, people are capturing creatures for trade and medicine because of high unemployment, poor education and the socio-political legacy of the Arab Spring revolts . Speaking at the awards, Sir David Attenborough said: ‘It’s the fiftieth birthday, 50 years of remarkable competitions, I remember the very first one…it was a great occasion but it’s marvellous to see what it’s grown into…It is a true privilege to be here.’ The exhibition will embark on an international tour across six continents and photographers can submit entries for next year’s competition from January 5 until February 26, 2015. Fabien Michenet, of France, photographed this juvenile sharpear enope squid in Tahiti, French Polynesia. He had to dive at night to get his picture and said that apart from the occasional sound of a dolphin, it was silent. The squid he captured was just one inch (3cm) long and was hunting smaller creatures under the cover of darkness .","Michael ‘Nick’ Nichols’ photograph of a pride of lazing lions beat more than 42,000 entries to win the accolade .

"The mother of six who faked her own battle with cancer to get money from sympathetic strangers has spoken out, revealing that she genuinely believed she was sick. The family and friends of Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds, 31, have been left devastated by her deception after it was revealed she never had stage six ovarian cancer like she claimed. In an interview with Woman's Day Ms Edmunds, from Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, said she believed her mind had tricked her into thinking she had the terminal illness – and she even underwent chemotherapy using pills she bought on the internet. Scroll down for video . Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds, 31, had reported that she was diagnosed with stage six ovarian cancer in April, and had been told she had only three years left to live . 'I really thought I was dying… I honestly thought my kids were going to grow up without me,' she told the magazine. In April, Ms Edmunds sat her family down and told them she had cancer and doctors had given her just three years to live. The mother-of-six from Lake Macquarie, NSW, went to great lengths to convince friends, family, and strangers that she had cancer, shaving her head and faking hospital visits for chemotherapy treatments . She went to great lengths to keep up the charade, faking hospital visits and shaving her head. But now she is unable to explain how she spent the time her family believed she was using to go to appointments and receive treatment. Strangers set up a Facebook page and online crowd-funding account to raise money for her – but last month Ms Edmunds' partner John Heaghney found out the truth and posted a status to let everyone know. Ms Edmunds said she was sorry for her deception, which has totally destroyed her relationships with her partner and children. The 31-year-old said she thought the loss of a newborn baby seven years ago may have led her to suffer a breakdown, which led her to make up the cancer. 'I don't know how my mind has done this to me,' she told Woman's Day. The Lake Macquarie woman added that she would pay back the money that was raised for her, even though she had spent it on medication and doctors' appointments. Sydney mother Jessica McKay, who took pity when she heard Ms Edmunds' story and set up a Help For Elle Facebook page to raise money, says she feels devastated by the whole ordeal. 'I had so many people willing to support and help out and she never had cancer',' Ms McKay wrote on the social networking site. 'I felt betrayed and so upset that I had gone to all this hard work of trying to raise donations for this low life piece of s*** who faked cancer and scammed not just me but my friends, family and community that helped out.' Ms Edmunds said  she believed her mind had tricked her into believing she had the terminal illness – and she even underwent chemotherapy using pills she bought on the internet . Crowdfunding pages and Facebook charity groups were set up in support for Ms Edmunds, raising significant funds through charity functions and online auctions for her ongoing medical bills . Ms McKay and Roberta Williams, the ex-wife of Victorian gangland identity Carl Williams, organised a $150-a-head fundraiser for Ms Edmunds, but it never went ahead because she suddenly felt 'too sick' to attend. She said she would donate the money raised to children's charities. Members of the Facebook group who had contributed financially or had been raising awareness for Ms Edmunds labeled her actions 'disgusting', and called for jail time. One member posted that she hoped Ms Edmunds 'got what she deserved', and labeled her a 'disgrace to humanity, filthy lying cheating human, some will forgive you, many will not, and for someone thats lost loved ones to cancer, I feel no sadness any further for what karma comes your way [sic]'. 'The only truth you have admitted to is being very sick mentally, You are sick mentally, sick, sad and twisted and I feel devastated for your loved ones, let alone mine that were sucked into your evil bull***t.'","Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds told people  she had just three years left to live .

"Work has started to demolish a former coastguard's cottage which has been left just six inches (15cm) from a chalk cliff edge following erosion caused by bad weather this winter. A five-strong team of demolition men started four weeks' worth of work on the end-of-terrace property at Birling Gap, near Eastbourne, East Sussex, today. The privately owned cottage once formed a terrace of seven former coastguard properties built on the cliff overlooking the English Channel between 1800 and 1820. Preparations have begun to demolish this former coastguard's cottage which has been left just six inches (15cm) from a cliff edge following bad weather this winter . The privately owned cottage once formed a terrace of seven former coastguard properties (pictured in 1972) built on the cliff overlooking the English Channel in the 1800s . But, due to the pace of erosion, two cottages had to be demolished in 1994 and in the early 2000s - and now a third one is set to follow suit. Engineer Graham Kean, of Wealden District Council, said at least three metres of cliff has been lost along that section of Birling Gap in the past three months. Bad weather in February caused more than seven years' worth of erosion to cliffs on the East Sussex coastline, which has resulted in thousands of tonnes of rock falling into the sea. And he said that the property which will eventually be left at the end of the terrace will only have up to ten years before it too could succumb to erosion. Mark Hodgson, contracts director at Best Demolition, which is carrying out the work, said: ‘Recent collapses to the cliff have brought it much closer than it was previously. ‘The house really didn't need to be brought down but because the erosion has been so quick, we have been brought in fairly quickly to carry this out. ‘Today is a site set up. We need to get fencing up so that the public don't get too close, and do more work to the interior of the building so we can get scaffolding built to carry out rendering to the cottage that is going to remain - number four.’ Bad weather in February caused more than seven years' worth of erosion to cliffs on the East Sussex coastline . Engineer Graham Kean, of Wealden District Council, said at least three metres of cliff has been lost along that section of Birling Gap in the past three months . Two of the cottages, built between 1800 and 1820, had to be demolished in 1994 and in the early 2000s, and now a third one is set to follow suit . The team began by disassembling the roof by hand, as the unsteady cliff is too fragile to use heavy machinery or explosives. Mr Hodgson added: ‘To take a house down normally is a fairly simple process but, in this environment, we have to totally change our methodology. ‘Most of the work will be carried out from large cherry pickers, so we don't have to put anyone on the ground around the outside of the building, because the cliff could really go at any time. ‘On a daily basis we will be checking the cliff for any additional collapse that may happen. We will have to cut through the building so that we can carry out the protection work to number four. ‘Once that's done, we will strip the roof off by hand, bring all the walls down by hand and slowly, methodically work our way down from the top to the bottom.’ Evidence of the effects of erosion are clearly visible at Birling Gap, with a huge crack having opened up just yards from the cottages . Recent storms have caused the kind of damage that the National Trust - which is responsible for this stretch of picturesque coastline - was expecting, but not for some years to come . The organisation has warned that with more extreme weather predicted the rate of change on Britain's coastline will speed up . Mr Hodgson said it was not possible to allow the cottage to fall away into the sea naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach-goers below. Evidence of the effects of erosion are clearly visible at Birling Gap, with a huge crack having opened up just yards from the cottages. And large mounds of chalk cliff have formed at the base following recent collapses, which has led to the beach and the steps leading down to it to be closed off. Recent storms have caused the kind of damage that the National Trust - which is responsible for this stretch of picturesque coastline - was expecting, but not for some years to come. This photograph shows large cracks in the cliff at Birling Gap, East Sussex, which opened up following February's stormy weather . Hard defences, such as sea walls, are unlikely to be the best solution to coping with the forces of nature on our coasts, the National Trust has said .

Hard defences, such as sea walls, are unlikely to be the best solution to coping with the forces of nature on our coasts, the Trust has said, and more long-term planning is needed to minimise the impact of the changing climate. Other sites affected by the winter storms have included: Mullion Harbour in Cornwall; important wildlife sites at Blakeney, Norfolk and Orford Ness, Suffolk; Murlough national nature reserve in Northern Ireland; and Brownsea Island, Dorset. The National Trust owns more than 740 miles (1,191km) of coastline around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, around a tenth of the total coastline for the three countries.

"An original sketch of Winnie the Pooh playing Poohsticks with his friends Piglet and Christopher Robin is set to sell for more than £100,000 when it goes under the hammer next month. The illustration by EH Shepard was first published in 1928, and is one of the most famous images of AA Milne's beloved bear. It will be sold by Sotheby’s in London next month after being housed in a private collection for more than 40 years. On sale: An original sketch of Winnie the Pooh playing Poohsticks with his friends Piglet and Christopher Robin is set to sell for more than £100,000 when it goes under the hammer next month . Shepard’s ink drawing featured in Milne's book The House At Pooh Corner, for Chapter 6, entitled 'In which Pooh invents a new game and Eeyore joins in'. It accompanies the closing scene of the chapter where the three characters stand on the Poohsticks bridge, dropping their sticks into the water and watching them emerge on the other side of the crossing, as the mood changes from the high excitement of their new game to a more wistful atmosphere. 'For a long time they looked at the river beneath them, saying nothing, and the river said nothing too, for it felt very quiet and peaceful on this summer afternoon,' Milne wrote. Inspiration: Shephard’s ink drawing featured in the AA Milne book The House At Pooh Corner, and the bridge in the image was based on Posingford Bridge in East Sussex (right) Much-loved: The bridge was carefully restored and reopened by Christopher Milne (pictured) - the author’s son who inspired the character of Christopher Robin - in May 1979, before it was rebuilt in 1999 . Select and mark a stick found on the ground. Stand upstream and hold sticks out at arm's length. At an agreed signal drop the sticks. Anyone caught throwing theirs will be disqualified. Move to the other side of the bridge. The owner of the first stick to emerge wins. NB: As Rabbit says, they will 'take longer than you think'. The drawing will feature in Sotheby’s sale of English literature, history, children’s books and illustrations on December 9, alongside other illustrations by Shephard, and is estimated to sell for between £100,00 and £150,000. 'The illustration can be counted among the most familiar, and most loved, cultural references in English literature,' said a spokesman from the auction house. The original wooden crossing on which the illustration is based, Posingford Bridge, at Hartfield Farm, East Sussex, had fallen into disrepair by the 1970s. However, it was carefully restored and reopened by Christopher Milne - the author’s son who inspired the character of Christopher Robin - in May 1979 at a ceremony where it was called 'as important a bridge as any in the world'. It was completely rebuilt in 1999 after being worn down by the number of visitors wanting to follow in Pooh's footsteps. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own sticks with them to avoid damage being done to the surrounding trees. Born in December, 1879, Ernest Howard Shepard was working as a cartoonist at the magazine Punch, when he was recommended to Milne by a colleague in 1923. Illustrator: Ernest Howard Shepard was working as a cartoonist at the magazine Punch, when he was recommended to author AA Milne by a colleague in 1923 . Milne had inititally thought Shepard's style was not what he wanted, but used him to illustrate his book of poems When We Were Very Young before insisting the cartoonist illustrated more of his work. Milne recognised the contribution the illustrator had made to his books' success and arranged for him to receive a cut of the royalties, but Shepard eventually grew to resent 'that silly old bear' and felt his Pooh drawings overshadowed the rest of his work. Londoner Shepard was made an OBE in 1972 in recognition of his illustrations and died on March 24, 1976, aged 96. He also illustrated the characters for Kenneth Grahame's The Wind In The Willows. Milne died aged 74 in January 1956, and his son aged 75 in April 1996.","EH Shepard's sketch first published in 1928 for The House At Pooh Corner .

"Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat has agreed to sell some of its stake in McLaren to the Formula One team's overall head Ron Dennis, who is set to become the majority shareholder. 'No transaction has taken place, but the shareholders have had discussions on how to best facilitate and enhance the future growth of the McLaren Group,' a McLaren spokesman said on Friday. 'When and if a transaction takes place, it is not envisioned that the current shareholders will exit McLaren completely, and announcements would be made at the appropriate time.' Ron Dennis (right) is to acquire a higher stake in McLaren when he buys shares from Mumtalakat . Dennis (centre) currently has a 25% share in the Formula One team . No details were given about the number of shares involved, with Mumtalakat currently holding a 50 percent stake. Dennis and Saudi-born businessman Mansour Ojjeh, the chief executive of Luxembourg-based TAG, each hold 25 percent. The share purchase agreements were signed last August between Mumtalakat, TAG and Dennis. An informed source emphasised that while the Bahrainis were willing to sell some shares, they had no intention of leaving McLaren entirely. Formula One's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone had told reporters on Thursday that Dennis, the McLaren group chief executive and former team principal, was in the process of regaining control. Dennis (right) poses in Woking at the McLaren driver's announcement this week . 'They (the Bahrainis) are nothing to do with the race team any more. They have sold the shares to Ron,' said the 84-year-old Briton. 'He's got to pay for them by a certain date. If he doesn't pay, they will obviously take everything back again. But at the moment, Ron would own the company.' British-based McLaren, who also have a growing sportscar business, have carried out a major restructuring of their Formula One team to get it back to the top after two under-performing years. The team, who have not won a race since 2012, announced on Thursday the return of Spain's double world champion Fernando Alonso, who left them under a cloud in 2007, to partner 2009 world champion Jenson Button. They are also starting a new partnership with Japanese manufacturer Honda, whose engines powered them to championships in the late 1980s and early 1990s with Brazilian Ayrton Senna and French driver Alain Prost.","Ron Dennis is set to become the majority shareholder in McLaren .

"What is this wonder ingredient? No, not some fancy foreign oil but plain old beef dripping . James Martin says it’s the secret of his rich and moist fruit cake. Mary Berry uses it in her classic lasagne. Heston Blumenthal swears by it for ‘perfect’ roast potatoes. And Rick Stein fries his fish and chips in it at his restaurant in Padstow. So what is this wonder ingredient? No, not some fancy foreign oil but plain old beef dripping. This wartime staple is returning to British tables thanks to new research that suggests fat is an essential part of our diet and that we should be consuming it instead of refined carbohydrates and sugar. The many endorsements by culinary experts are helping, too. This year, gourmet butcher James Whelan won a prestigious Great Taste Award — described as the Oscars of the food world — for the dripping he makes from Angus and Hereford beef, beating more than 10,000 recipes for other far more exotic dishes. Since then, Waitrose has seen its Aberdeen Angus dripping (99p for 200g) fly off the shelves. I remember eating dripping in my grandmother’s kitchen in Birmingham in the Sixties. Back then, it was a treat for us children. Before that, in the Forties and Fifties, it was a staple of school lunches. But the diet and fat-conscious Seventies and Eighties saw dripping and other fats fall out of favour — the enemy of aerobicised waistlines. Modern research, however, is recognising fat as an essential part of our diet — needed to protect organs and aid the absorption of vitamins. And according to many scientists, we are probably better consuming animal fats like butter and dripping. There’s evidence, for instance, that the omega-6 polyunsaturated fat found in margarines made from sunflower oil can lead to inflammation of the arteries and trigger heart disease. When it comes to dripping, it has more calories than butter (889 per 100g compared with 717) and the same amount of saturated fat (51 per cent) but by virtue of its much stronger flavour, far less is required. So while you may slather butter on your bread, half a teaspoon of dripping on a slice is easily enough to flavour it wonderfully. It has more calories than butter (889 per 100g compared with 717) and the same amount of saturated fat (51 per cent) but by virtue of its much stronger flavour, far less is required . The dripping typically sold in supermarkets contains 23 per cent monounsaturates — the kind of fat in olive and rapeseed oils — and 62 per cent polyunsaturates, found in ‘healthy’ sunflower and soya oils. And it has none of the ‘trans’ fats known to increase cholesterol levels. Crucially, it contains no sugar or additives either, unlike other spreads such as jam and peanut butter. Fashionable restaurants such as the Quality Chop House in London are making their own dripping by slowly rendering down beef fat, then refining it to a creamy white texture before serving. Dripping is also being used in the more distinguished gastro pubs — for cooking Yorkshire puddings and enriching the flavour of toad in the hole. And at James Martin’s restaurant in The Talbot Hotel, North Yorkshire, you can even get a dessert of panna cotta with roasted rhubarb and dripping cake. Mary Berry uses it in her classic lasagne . Also making a comeback are lard — pork fat — and suet (the fat surrounding the kidneys and loins of cows and sheep). Lard was once such a key part of our diet that the very place we store our food — the larder — was named after it. Among its fans is Delia Smith, who makes delightful Canadian buttermilk pancakes with lard, served with maple syrup. Meanwhile, suet is part of the gourmet sausage revival, being added with the rest of the meat before binding. Dr Carina Norris, the nutritionist on Channel 4’s Turn Back Your Body Clock, says: ‘Now that we know sugar and refined carbohydrates are worse for us than we thought, it’s a good time to reassess the old-fashioned foods we have dismissed. ‘We need fats to help our bodies absorb vital vitamins, including vitamin A, which helps the digestive system, vitamin D for bone growth, vitamin E, which aids the immune system, and vitamin K, which helps blood to clot. ‘We’ve got in the habit of ladling jam on to white bread and butter. But a slice of delicious bread, such as sourdough, with a dab of beef dripping could be healthier.’ Yet as I prepare to take a bite of dripping on bread — my first for decades — I’m still unsure. Can it really taste as good as my usual treat of toast and Bonne Maman strawberry jam? I needn’t have worried — my childhood delight at its taste floods back. The dripping is the consistency of clotted cream, with a delicate meaty smell. Just a tiny spoonful gives all the flavour of Sunday roast on toast. Delicious!","It has more calories than butter (889 per 100g compared with 717)

"Tennis ace Roger Federer is set to move into a £6.5million glass mansion in a Swiss tax-haven on the shores of Lake Zurich. Federer and his family are set to move in to the state-of-the-art three-storey building at the end of the year, and are believed to be joined by his parents Robert and Lynette, who could be the new residents in the two luxury apartments being built in addition to the main home. The building, called The Residence, is located in Wollerau in Schwyz county, and comes with  floor-to-ceiling windows, a swimming pool and large balconies with magnificent views stretching across Lake Zurich. Scroll down for video . Roger Federer has racked up 17 Grand Slam titles during his career and is often regarded as the best tennis player of all time . Federer is building a £6.5million 'glass home' on the hills overlooking Lake Zurich in Switzerland . The house, called 'The Residence' is in Wollerau, Schwyz county, and has floor-to-ceiling glass windows throughout . Federer, 33, moved from his birthplace of Basel to the 'tax paradise' of Wollerau in March 2008, one year before marrying Slovakian-born Mirka, 36. Located about 20 minutes drive from Zurich, and an hour from Basel, Wollerau is one of the lowest tax municipalities in Europe and the liberal tax structure has attracted other multi-millionaires. Formula One drivers Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa and the former UBS chairman Marcel Ospel have all chosen to live in the canton. Federer's new glass-walled home, being built on a plot of about 1.5 acres with underground parking, is believed to be worth £6.5million. The  500sq.m property will have plenty of room  for Federer, Mirka  and their two sets of twins – five-year-old girls Myla and Charlene and boys Leo and Lenny, born last May.

Federer and former tennis player wife Mirka, pictured left and right in 2009, when Mirka was pregnant with their oldest set of twins . A computer-generated image shows what appears to be the Federers' en-suite master bedroom . Wollerau, located about 20 minutes from Zurich, is considered a 'tax haven' and is one of the lowest tax municipalities in Europe . Due to the location on the hillside and the property overlooking the water, there will be no insight into the home, despite the glass walls . Federer famously likes to take his whole brood on the road, and brought both sets of twins to Wimbledon this year, despiter Leo and Lenny being just a few weeks old. He said at a press conference after his sons were born that taking them all on the road is hard work but worth it. 'My wife does a lot of work, as much as she can. And I try to help as much as I can,' he explained. 'We have the grandparents as well and all my team members, they sometimes just tag along. Clearly we also need some help on the road, so Mirka can have an opportunity sometimes to sleep in a little bit, or come to watch one of my matches. 'You need to be well organised, but by now we know how it works. I am looking forward to life on the tour with the family, and it will be a long time without any travelling after the tennis is over. So I'm looking forward to the next couple of years now.' Scores of builders have been working to get the impressive structure completed this year, described as 'prestigious, contemporary architecture with extensive glazing,' by the developer, Kamata Development. The additional flats are believed to be for Federer's parents Robert and Lynette, pictured here with Mirka and the couple's oldest daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, during the 2012 Wimbledon tournament . The surrounding properties are built in similar luxurious style, climbing on the hillside and overlooking the water .

"No amount of left-over wrapping can paper over the cracks at London Welsh. Sitting bottom of the Aviva Premiership, the Exiles are in desperate need of some comfort and joy. The statistics are damning. The Oxford club have suffered 10 defeats in 10 games and are in danger of becoming only the second team in league history to be relegated without a single victory. These are new experiences for Piri Weepu, their World Cup winning scrum-half. His first three months in the Northern Hemisphere delivered more losses than nine seasons as a New Zealand international, but the veteran is not afraid of mucking in. Former All Blacks scrum half Piri Weepu dives to try and tackle Saracens' Chris Ashton last Saturday . ‘I’ve been in backs-to-the-wall situations before,’ said Weepu. ‘Leading into the World Cup, the All Blacks lost two games in a row. We were expected to win it but we kept focused on what we needed to achieve. ‘The circumstances are different here but we’ve just got to try to overcome it. People need to sell papers and they might talk rubbish about you to do that, but that doesn’t mean we have to buy into it. Comments in the tabloids can ruin your mood if you let them, but we just need to train our backsides off and stay positive.’ Saracens scored 11 tries against Welsh in the 78-7 win, the worst defeat the Exiles have suffered this year . Played 10, Lost 10 . Points for 80, Against 490 . Average possession per game: 14.41minutes . Goal kicking accuracy: 55% . Missed tackles per game: 28 . Turnovers conceded per game: 15 . Lineout success: 75% . Scrum success: 78% . Improvements are needed across the board. Welsh have managed less than 15 minutes possession per game this season and have lost by an average of 41 points. They have fired in neither attack nor defence, but one of their most consistent downfalls has been at the set-piece. During their 78-7 defeat by Saracens on Saturday, they lost eight out of 13 lineouts on their own throw. Their scrum did not fare much better and, throughout the season, they have lost 20 per cent of ball on their own feed. This is compounded by an average concession of 15 turnovers per game, leaving the recently promoted side in desperate need of a morale boost. A victory over London Irish on Boxing Day would be the perfect festive tonic, with Irish sitting one place above Welsh in the league. Weepu, for one has not given up hope. Elliot Kear touches down a solitary consolation try for London Welsh, but Weepu insists they are improving . ‘If there’s no belief left, then we probably shouldn’t be in the competition,’ said the 31-year-old. ‘I still love the sport. I still love lacing up the boots and getting amongst it. Even if we’re getting pumped, I still love it. As long as you try your hardest, then that’s all we can really ask. We just need to get our roles right — we create opportunities in games but then we’re not picking the right options.’ Former Wales back row Rowland Phillips was brought in as a defence coach last month in a bid to turn around the club’s fortunes. A losing bonus point against Leicester showed signs of progress, but the Exiles still boast the worst tackle success rate in the league, missing an average of 28 per game. Phillips says there have been statistical improvements over the last seven weeks but is fully aware of the scale of the challenge. Despite the leakiest defence in the league, Rowland Phillips insists the defence is getting tougher . ‘There’s no fairy godmother who’s going to make everything perfect,’ said Phillips. ‘I joined this group about eight weeks ago and the timing meant I couldn’t just rip everything up and start again. It’s hard for me to convince people, but I have seen a certain improvement. There is hunger, but we’re not going to win on pure emotion. We need better structures to earn our right to win. The players know they have to improve and they want to improve.’ Phillips has been tasked with fixing the problems but the roots, he believes, stem from the short summer turnaround. The Exiles were rank outsiders for promotion but beat Bristol through the controversial play-off system. While Bristol had already recruited heavily for what seemed inevitable promotion, Welsh panicked in the transfer market place with sporadic recruitment, signing players on a shoestring budget. Weepu has bags of experience from his time with the All Blacks, and believes his side can turn things around . ‘Things happened pretty quickly,’ said Phillips. ‘The play-off season goes on late and the Premiership starts early, so our training and recruitment were affected by the preparation time. You’ve got a small window, with players coming off a tough Championship season. There’s about a one-week break and then you’re back in. That has a bearing on how your season unfolds. ‘Any gambling man would have bet on Bristol to walk into the Premiership, but it didn’t happen. Some say the system isn’t effective and there should be no promotion or relegation, but we’re trying to get away from a ring-fence mentality. Exeter are an example of a team who got promoted and grew. As soon as you close it off, then that kills off a lot of teams’ ambitions.’ The plight of London Welsh, it seems, will do little for the cause.","London Welsh have lost every game so far this season .

"Uncapped Newport Gwent Dragons centre Tyler Morgan is among the latest group of players to sign a national dual contract. Morgan, 19, his Dragons colleague Hallam Amos and Scarlets prop Rhodri Jones have all put pen to paper on deals 60 per cent funded by the Welsh Rugby Union and 40 per cent by the player's region. The trio join Wales captain Sam Warburton and Ospreys flanker Dan Lydiate in agreeing dual contract terms. Tyler Morgan, 19, is one of those to be handed a national dual contract by Wales . Players holding the new contracts - a total of 12 have so far been offered deals, with more signings expected in the near future - will benefit from a total £3.3million fund, with the WRU providing £2m of that and the regions £1.3m. The current list has been drawn up by Wales head coach Warren Gatland, and stems from the Rugby Services Agreement that was signed earlier this year between the WRU and four Welsh regions - Dragons, Scarlets, Ospreys and Cardiff Blues. Morgan, who made nine appearances for Wales Under-20 this year, said: 'I am over the moon to sign a national dual contract. 'The contracts allow us to work closely with the national squad management, and for me that was a big incentive. 'Being able to get that extra advice and guidance will really benefit me going forward.' Wales captain Sam Warburton is one of those on the national deal with the Welsh Rugby Union . Amos, a 20-year-old wing or full-back, made his Wales senior debut against Tonga last year, and was also part of Gatland's squad during the recent autumn Tests. And 22-year-old Jones has become an integral part of Wales' match-day 23, featuring throughout the 2014 RBS 6 Nations Championship and autumn internationals. 'These contracts offer us stability and peace of mind, as well as first-class resources to allow players to concentrate on playing,' Jones said. 'The Scarlets have played a huge part in my career so far, and I hope I can reward theirs and the WRU's faith in me in the coming seasons.' Gatland, meanwhile, added: 'This is another important step forward as some of our youngest prospects commit their futures to the game in Wales. 'The structure we have created means a player's development and welfare is monitored by the national squad management, and this will help players realise their full potential. 'National dual contracts will strengthen the game at national and regional level, and we would like to thank the regions for their help in this process.'","Newport Gwent Dragons centre Tyler Morgan, 19, given dual contract .

"Sale have tied down young prospects Mike Haley and Josh Beaumont to new two-year deals. The duo are both highly rated with the Aviva Premiership club, who currently lie fifth in the standings ahead of their clash with Leicester on Saturday. Haley, 20, has displaced Italy international Luke McLean as full-back and 22-year-old Beaumont, son of former England captain Bill, is a regular in the number eight role. Josh Beaumont, son of former England captain Bill, has signed a new two-year deal with Sale Sharks . 'Josh and Mike are both great lads and we are delighted they have both agreed their new deals with the club,' said Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond. 'Josh is a like a sponge in that he soaks up all the information. He's thriving on the responsibility. 'Mike's another who has seized his opportunity with both hands. Nothing fazes him and he has kicked on massively keeping a current international out of the starting side. 'Both lads have taken their opportunities and if they carry on performing like they have done then they know they will stay in the team.' The Sharks are attempting to tie down their young talent, with hooker Tommy Taylor signing a fresh 12-month deal last week.

"England's Lee Westwood won the Thailand Golf Championship by one shot on Sunday after US Open champion Martin Kaymer and third-round leader Marcus Fraser both slipped up at the end. Westwood reeled off seven birdies in 10 holes then tapped in for par at the last to complete a superb five-under round of 67 for an eight-under total of 280 at Amata Spring Country Club . Fraser, playing on a sponsors invite after missing most of the year because of a wrist problem, could have forced a playoff with a par of his own at the last but the Australian made a bogey to drop back to seven-under. Lee Westwood poses with his prize after winning the Asian Tour's Thailand Golf Championship on Sunday . Westwood carded seven birdies in 10 holes to claim the title at Amata Spring Country Club by one shot . Westwood studies the 17th green on his way to an overall score of eight-under . Westwood's Ryder Cup-winning team mate Kaymer also came unstuck right near the end, making his only bogey of the day on the penultimate hole, to finish tied with Fraser, one behind Westwood. The victory provided Westwood with his 41st career win and his second Thailand Golf Championship. Westwood was delighted with his victory and tweeted afterwards: 'It's been a good last day of school' - a nod to his season now being at a close. Fraser had started the day one ahead of India's Anirban Lahiri (73) and two clear of the former world number ones as he went in search of his first Tour title in over four years. The leader going into the final round, Marcus Fraser, narrowly missed a putt to force a playoff . Westwood's Ryder Cup team-mate Martin Kaymer's bogey on the 17th saw him tie for second with Fraser . Five birdies in his opening 11 holes stretched that lead to three as Lahiri fell away but as Westwood and Kaymer closed the gap with birdies after the Australian tossed in a bogey at the 12th. Westwood made four birdies in a row from the sixth then added three more on the back nine and held his nerve with three closing pars over the demanding final stretch as his rivals slipped up. Southport's Tommy Fleetwood was two shots further back in fourth after carding a final-round 70, while defending champion Spain's Sergio Garcia finished ninth on two under after his score of 69 on Sunday saw him move up a spot. Bubba Watson of America ended the tournament in joint 25th after struggling with scores of 76 and 77 in rounds one and three respectively - on the par-72 course - while Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke fared even worse with scores of 75, 75, 73 and 74 meaning he finished in a five-way tie for 50th.","Lee Westwood won Thailand Golf Championship at Amata Spring .

"South African Branden Grace cruised to a wire-to-wire victory on home soil at the Alfred Dunhill Championship after his main rivals failed to reel him in on the final day. The 26-year-old began the day with just a one-stroke lead over Lucas Bjerregaard but the Dane's bogey at the first immediately eased the pressure and when Grace birdied the next he had a three-shot cushion. As Bjerregaard imploded after a triple-bogey six at the short seventh, covering the back nine in 50, former Open winner Louis Oosthuizen, last week's Nedbank champion Danny Willett and Andrew Johnston all made a bid to challenge but all slipped up when they looked like getting close.

"When Jack Nowell was told by Stuart Lancaster and his medical staff he risked being exposed as a one-trick pony if he didn’t undergo surgery, the young Exeter Chief hardly had a leg to stand on. Following five years of playing with pain in his left knee because of a chronic condition developed as a teenager, things got so bad that muscle started to wither and opponents began to take note. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a new lease of life following surgery which has finally enabled him to deliver a pain-free performance on two legs instead of one. Exeter full-back Jack Nowell has undergone surgery on a knee injury that had been causing him problems . England coach Stuart Lancaster had warned Nowell that he could turn into a one-trick pony without treatment . ‘I’ve had a patellar tendinitis problem since I was 15,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It was a big problem but I just cracked on hoping it would go away. It never did. ‘Being a youngster you think no-one will notice but with the amount of analysis that goes on now it was only a matter of time before I was sussed out. It was getting pretty obvious. ‘I got to the end of last season and the physios and Stuart just said, “There’s no way you can carry on like this”. ‘I could feel a massive difference straight away (after surgery). I’m over the moon with how it’s gone. It’s made a massive difference.’ Nowell, pictured training with the England squad at Pennyhill Park, is now back fit after his operation . The England man in action for his country during the Six Nations match against Wales in March 2014 . His performances after making his comeback caught Lancaster’s eye, with England’s head coach calling him into the squad for the autumn series. ‘He said he’d been impressed by how quickly I’d recaptured my form,’ Nowell said. ‘That was good to hear from him. ‘It’s been an incredible year but hopefully there’s more to come.

"Burnley’s talismanic forward Danny Ings has pledged to remain at the club until the end of the season. The forward’s contract is due to expire at the end of this season and a number of clubs are understood to be interested in attempting to prise Ings away from Turf Moor in the January transfer window. Ings produced another eye-catching performance during’s Burnley’s remarkable 2-2 draw at Manchester City on Sunday and Newcastle United, Southampton, Leicester City, West Bromwich Albion and German side Wolfsburg have all been credited with an interest in the England Under 21 striker. Danny Ings has impressed during his first season in the Premier League . Although Ings is less committal over his plans beyond the end of this season, he insists that he is going nowhere for now and that his focus remains on preserving Burnley’s Premier League status. ‘That was the plan,’ Ings said, ‘I’m contracted until the end of the season and that’s the way it’s going to be. Now I can fight for the team as much as I can and do my best for them.’ The 22-year-old forward, who has been watched extensively by England scouts this season, also maintained he will not be distracted by any offers that may come his way in January. Ings has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs in recent weeks . ‘I won’t be looking at that. I will just take that sign as confidence and take it into my game and do as well as I can for Burnley. ‘Especially for a young lad, it’s quite easy to lose concentration for some people. But I’m not that sort of character. I’ve got a job here to do at Burnley and am contracted until the end of the season - and that’s the way it’s going to be.’ Burnley remain in the relegation zone but only courtesy of goal difference after a recent revival that has seen Sean Dyche’s lose only three of their last nine league games.

Burnley’s fitness has received particular acclaim after Dyche named an unchanged team for both the Boxing Day match against Liverpool and the draw at City, with the manager also electing not to make a substitution on Sunday. ‘We train as we play on a weekend,’ Ings explains, ‘You can’t just flick a switch and expect to perform, especially in this league.","Danny Ings has impressed during his first year in the Premier League .

"Champion trainer Paul Nicholls has said he accepts things will not always run smoothly as young stable jockey Sam Twiston-Davies beds into his first season in the high-profile role. The 21-year-old came in for some criticism after favourite Zarkandar hit the front in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot on Saturday but was ultimately beaten a head by the rallying Reve De Sivola, who was winning the race for the third year. There was an irony in the outcome as the winner was ridden by Daryl Jacob, who operated as Nicholls' main jockey last season. Paul Nicholls has called for patience around jockey Sam Twiston-Davies . Twiston-Davies was beaten tiding Zarkandar in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot on Saturday . The win was Jacob's most important since deciding to go freelance rather than revert to the No 2 jockey job he had previously held behind former Nicholls' stable jockey Ruby Walsh. Nicholls said: 'If Sam rode Zarkandar again, he would do things differently. It is the first time he has ridden him in that situation and you never stop learning. It won't be happening next time. 'He hasn't got that much experience riding in those very big races. When you appoint a young jockey you have to accept these things. He is a good lad. 'We are all competitive and don't like giving races away but he will learn from it. Ruby made plenty of mistakes when he was riding. 'Sometimes these talented horses aren't straightforward. Zarkandar wants a more competitive field where he can get a bit of cover. He is a monkey but a very talented monkey.' Zarkandar will now be freshened up for the Cheltenham Festival. Nicholls added: 'He will not run before the World Hurdle. That is the only race I am aiming him at.' Zarkandar is 12-1 for the World Hurdle with sponsors Ladbrokes. The Jonjo O' Neill-trained 7-2 favourite and last season's winner More Of That could run in February after undergoing a breathing operation in the aftermath of his disappointing comeback third in Newbury's Long Distance Hurdle. Daryl Jacob (left) took Reve De Sivola to victory ahead of Zarkandar at Ascot on Saturday . Jacob was the main jockey under Nicholls last season, before Twiston-Davies had the role . Meanwhile, Nicholls has three of the 10 possibles for the William Hill King George at Kempton on Boxing Day with Twiston-Davies on Al Ferof and Noel Fehily on favourite and his 2013 winner Silviniaco Conti. If the going continues to dry, they could be joined by Wonderful Charm (Nick Scholfield). Jamie Moore says he hopes to be fit to ride Nigel Twiston-Davies' Double Ross. Moore has not ridden since a fall on No Buts in the big handicap chase at Cheltenham on December 13. Moore said: 'I have had a history of shoulder problems and I pulled some muscles. I have been having physio and fingers crossed I will be there.' The six horses who could oppose unbeaten Champion Hurdle favourite Faugheen in the Christmas Hurdle on Boxing Day include Irving, Elite Hurdle winner Purple Bay, A Sign Of A Victory and Sgt Reckless.","Paul Nicholls understands Sam Twiston-Davies needs time as main jockey .

"A deadly terrorist attack designed to kill thousands which had been codenamed '9/11 the second' by plotters has been foiled by Jordanian security forces, it was claimed tonight. Authorities say the al-Qaeda cell wanted to inflict 'the heaviest human losses possible' with coordinated suicide strikes on shopping centres and Western diplomats in the country's capital capital Amman. Last night 11 suspects who planned on carrying out bombings using smuggled weapons and . explosives brought from Syria were in police custody, it is claimed. Arrested: Security forces released pictures of the 11 suspects accused of planning a deadly suicide attacks on shopping centres and Western diplomats . Deadly plot: The 11 men, all pictured, are alleged to have been part of an al-Qaeda cell planning to kill thousands in Jordan with rocket attacks and bombings on a number of 'vital institutions' Had the plot come to fruition, the death toll could have reached thousands and destabalised the country's security and had been going on since June. But intelligence agencies had been monitoring the conspiracy from day one, Jordanian official said. The country's state TV broadcast mugshots of . the suspects - all in their 20s and 30s, all bar one wearing the same issue dark blue shirt, with most of them sporting long . beards - identifying them as 'militants'. Announcing . the foiled plot, government spokesman Sameeh Maaytah told an impromptu . press conference that the suspects are all Jordanian and are in police . custody. 'They were plotting deadly terror attacks on vital institutions, shopping centers and diplomatic missions,' he said. 'They sought to destabilize Jordan,' he said. 'They plotted against Jordan's national security.' Carnage: The 11 alleged plotters are accused of planning strikes to 'inflict the heaviest human losses possible' A . statement by Jordanian intelligence said an investigation showed that . the group 'adopts the ideology of al-Qaida' and that it nicknamed its . terror plot as '9/11 the second' - a reference to the Amman hotel . blasts, which happened on Nov. 9, 2005. Since June, the suspects have been . surveying targets across the country, bringing in rockets from Syria to . use in the alleged plot, the statement said. The militants sought to carry out . their attacks in stages, it added, with initial attacks on shopping . centers and foreigners in Jordanian hotels, followed by more deadly . strikes with powerful explosives and chemicals on Western diplomatic . missions and unspecified 'vital national sites'. One planned attack involved firing rockets at . a district in the Jordanian capital that houses the U.S., British and . other diplomatic missions as well as housing for expats and Western . diplomats, it was claimed. '9/11 the second': Jordanian security forces say the al-Qaeda terror cell had already detonated trial explosives during the final stages of preparing for the attack . The statement said al-Qaida . 'explosive experts' based in Iraq and elsewhere have assisted the . suspects with manufacturing home-made explosives. The statement did not say when the . suspects were arrested, but Maaytah - the government spokesman - said . Jordanian intelligence apprehended them in the past few days. 'Their plans included getting explosives and mortars from Syria,' a security source revealed. A security source said the suspects had manufactured explosives 'aimed at inflicting the heaviest losses possible'. 'The group was able to devise new types of explosives to be used for the first time and planned to add TNT to increase their destructive impact,' said the source. The same security source said there was a crucial link with Syria where President Bashar al-Assad is battling to put down an uprising against his family's rule. 'Their plans included getting explosives and mortars from Syria,' the security source told Reuters, saying the militants had sought to strike at a time of regional upheaval when the country's security establishment is over stretched. The authorities said they had seized large quantities of ammunition, machine guns and other items such as computers. The militants were training to use 'suicide bombers using explosive belts and booby-trapped cars', said another security source. Jordan is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East and Israel's peace partner. The Arab kingdom has often been . targeted by al-Qaeda and other Islamic militants. It regularly arrests . terror suspects and puts them on trial. Government spokesman Sameeh Maaytah says the suspects are all Jordanian and are in police custody. He said the men had brought in arms . from neighboring Syria to use them in the alleged plot. Syria links: The foiled terrorist plot is thought to have originated from Syria - in chilling echoes of the devastating explosion in Ashrafieh, east Beirut, pictured, . He also said . al-Qaida operatives based in Iraq have been assisting the suspects with . manufacturing home-made explosives. He said Sunday that Jordanian intelligence agents arrested the suspects in the past few days. Had the plot come to fruition, it is feared the death toll would have dwarfed a recent car bombing in Beirut - also linked to the civil war torn neighbouring country. This is the latest incident to be linked to the spiralling violence spilling out of neighbouring Syria. Carnage: Mikati worked with Hezbollah and regularly came under fire to resign from the Sunni-led opposition since October of last year, when a car bomb exploded in Beirut . Lebanon's prime minister said this week that a massive car bombing originated from Syria. The bomb exploded during rush hour in the mainly Christian district of Ashrafiya killed eight including a top security official, and injured nearly 100 - deadliest bombing in Beirut in four years. Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the blast is linked to the intelligence chief's recent case, in which he exposed an alleged plot by Syria to sow chaos in Lebanon.","Al-Qaeda plot hatched since June targeted shopping centres and Western diplomats .

"Alan Irvine insisted that he can still turn things around at West Brom and save his job despite suffering a seventh defeat in nine league games at Stoke.

Sometimes they work sometimes they don’t.’ On the abuse he suffered at the end, the Scot added: ‘I can understand. People are frustrated, I’m frustrated, and so are the players. I can understand them expressing that, it’s the nature of the job. ‘If anyone is going to take it then I’m the person. I’m there to be shot at. I stand out there and take it.

"Chelsea came from behind at St Mary's to draw 1-1 with Ronald Koeman's Southampton. Sadio Mane opened the scoring for the hosts before Eden Hazard netted a brilliant equaliser. Morgan Schneiderlin was sent off late on whistle Cesc Fabregas was booked for simulation in the penalty area. Find out how the other players got on with Sportsmail's player ratings. SOUTHAMPTON . Fraser Forster – 6 . One shot on target from the visitors, but the England international couldn’t do anything about the goal. Dominant from set-pieces. Blues substitute Didier Drogba stretches for the ball but he is unable to score past Fraser Forster . Maya Yoshida - 6 (Gardos 62, 6) Alarm bells were ringing when the team sheets saw Yoshida up against Hazard, but he coped well, albeit with the help of several others. Jose Fonte - 7 . Costa wasn’t able to out-muscle the Portuguese defender on this occasion and was quiet at St Mary’s. Toby Alderweireld - 6.5 . Moved into the centre to deal with Costa, and as mentioned above Chelsea’s top scorer just couldn’t get into the game. Cesc Fabregas goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by Southampton youngster Matt Targett . Matt Targett - 6 . Another English left back from Southampton’s academy, sound familiar? The Saints may have another star on their hands after a solid first Premier League start. Morgan Schneiderlin - 6.5 . Superb all game until two sloppy tackles in the second-half which saw him sent off. Victor Wanyama 6.5 . Cut out spaces well in midfield and a dominant physical presence as always. Steven Davis - 6 (Long 77, 6) The midfield runner, and run he did. Mikel probably wasn’t needed to deal with his attacking threat . Sadio Mane raced past Chelsea's defence before lifting the ball over Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois . Saido Mane - 7 . Took his goal superbly, his pace troubled John Terry all afternoon. Two in two for the Senegalese summer signing. Dusan Tadic - 7 (Ward-Prowse 58, 6) Has struggled with injuries of late but the Saints look much more dangerous with him in the side. Graziano Pelle - 6 . Tough for their top scorer today. Often isolated, Pelle was booked for a frustrated tackle late on. Manager - Ronald Koeman: 7 . Chelsea captain John Terry applauds the travelling Blues fans after the final whistle . CHELSEA . Thibaut Courtois - 6 . Rarely troubled on Sunday and like Forster, couldn’t do anything about the goal. Always surprised when the ball gets past him. Branislav Ivanovic - 6 . Solid but unspectacular going forward. In games like these, Chelsea could do with a real attacking threat from full back. Gary Cahill - 6 . Has been shaky in recent weeks but dealt with Pelle comfortably. The Italian’s game suited Cahill and Terry. Fabregas was booked by Premier League official Anthony Taylor for an apparent dive . John Terry - 6 . Experienced defender was left behind by Mane but other than that was faultless. Filipe Luis - 6 . A few over-hit crosses didn’t help him in his time to shine. Cesar Azpilicueta shouldn’t worry too much. John Obi Mikel - 5.5 (Drogba 74) On hindsight, didn’t really need to be selected. Offers little to nothing going forward and even Matic is better defensively. Nemanja Matic - 6 . A quiet game by his standards. Played alongside Mikel against Stoke but the partnership appeared uneasy this time. Andre Schurrle - 4 . Another poor game for the German who has been bereft of form since the World Cup. Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard jumps in the air after scoring his side's equaliser just before the interval . Cesc Fabregas - 7 . Unfortunate to be booked for simulation and, another assist for the former Barcelona man to add to his impressive collection. Eden Hazard - 7.5 . Another brilliant goal by the Belgian who has been the league leaders' stand-out player this season. Diego Costa - 6 (Remy 89) Kept quiet by Fonte and couldn't influence the game. Nothing really went right for him. Manager - Jose Mourinho: 6 . Referee: Anthony Taylor 6.

Pritchard has impressed in the Championship this season, making a valuable contribution as Mark Warburton’s team have mounted a surprise bid for promotion.

"West Bromwich Albion have made contact with Tim Sherwood and Tony Pulis about the prospect of replacing sacked Alan Irvine. The pair are the leading candidates to take over, with chairman Jeremy Peace eager to make a new appointment by the weekend. It is believed initial discussions have taken place with each manager’s representatives with further talks to come. Alan Irvine (above) was sacked by West Bromwich Albion on Monday evening . Former Tottenham Hotspur boss Tim Sherwood is the early favourite to take over at the Baggies . There are hurdles to overcome with both men. Pulis, 56, would provide an experienced hand in West Brom’s battle against the drop – having performed a similar role remarkably with Crystal Palace last season – but would insist on control of transfers. That would represent a significant departure for Peace from his current continental model, where technical director Terry Burton, only appointed last summer, identifies recruits. Pulis, who is understood to have been contacted late on Monday night, is also likely want trusted assistants David Kemp and Gerry Francis to join the Hawthorns staff. Tony Pulis - seen here working for BT Sport - is also in the frame for the West Brom job . Defender Lescott looks dejected after West Brom conceded the second goal to Stoke on Sunday . Sherwood came close to landing the job last summer before talks broke down over wages and his desire to bring in assistants Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey.

Sherwood, 45, has been out of work for nearly eight months since leaving Tottenham and West Brom have yet to offer a public assurance to current assistant Keith Downing over his future.

"Bus group tycoon Donald Parks is fronting a new £6.5million rescue plan for Rangers. The crisis-hit Ibrox outfit needs to find £8.3m before April 1 or face another financial meltdown. Now according to reports in several newspapers on Saturday morning, Parks has joined forces with wealthy Gers supporters George Letham and George Taylor to offer to underwrite a new shares issue. The move could prove to be a lifeline for the club after the Scottish Football Association announced on Christmas Eve that it had rejected Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's attempts to increase his involvement with the League One champions. Glasgow giants Rangers desperately need to find £8.3million before April 1 or face another financial meltdown . Hampden chiefs have been informed of the offer, which would see Park's consortium buy all 40,739,000 shares set to be issued after the board won a vote at last week's AGM giving it the right to raise new equity. Parks, founder of the successful Park's Motor Group, is reported to have a personal fortune of around £78m. He was part of the Blue Knights consortium which tried to save the club from liquidation almost three years ago. Letham, meanwhile, loaned the club £1m earlier this year to stave off another disaster, while Hong Kong-based Taylor bought a 3.2 per cent stake just last month. The offer - which also includes a demand for two board seats - was lodged with chairman David Somers immediately after he presided over the stormy shareholder meeting last Monday. With Ashley's attempts to boost his stake in Rangers from 8.92 per cent to 29.9 per cent set to be blocked by the SFA, the club now face three choices. Bus group tycoon and prospective Rangers investor Douglas Park (centre) watches a game at Ibrox . They could accept the Park consortium's offer, or instead turn to the rejected £16m investment plan lodged by former old co-director Dave King in October, which remains on the table. Alternatively, they could challenge the SFA's stance on Ashley through the courts and risk further punishment from the governing body in the meantime. But the Parks group have already gone on the attack, criticising the decision by Ashley and Sandy Easdale - the football board chairman who controls around 26 per cent of the club through shares and proxies - to reject resolution nine at the AGM. The motion would have given the club the right to have issued shares without first offering them to existing shareholders but the vote went 55-45 against it. Observers viewed that as an attempt by the board to keep any fresh investment in-house and a spokesman for the Parks group said: 'We find it disturbing that Resolution nine, which would have made it possible to issue shares for cash to new shareholders, failed to gain approval. The SFA rejected Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley's attempts to increase his stake earlier this week . 'Everyone knows the company is in dire need of fresh and significant investment and yet shareholders represented on the board decided to vote against investment from new shareholders. 'Presumably, they believed the SFA would clear the way for Mike Ashley to increase his holding but we now know that this was not approved. The SFA would have been aware there is a credible alternative and we would like to make sure the fans are aware of that, too. 'Our offer was based on Resolution nine being passed, but this was blocked. However, as existing shareholders we still believe it should be possible for us to gain a significant holding and are ready to invest in a new share issue. 'Our money is in place, proof of funding has been shown to the chairman and the company's nomad. We are trying our best to do what is right for Rangers and the supporters.

"Former Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock has heaped some of the blame for his Eagles demise on the state of the pitch at Selhurst Park. The 66-year-old, who was sacked as manager of the south London club on Sunday, endured a difficult four months, but says that he was not helped by the playing surface at Palace's home games. 'Aston Villa and Sunderland were disappointing performances [1-0 and 3-1 losses respectively]. Other than that, the pitch has been terrible at home,' Warnock told talkSPORT's Sports Breakfast. 'It's not bad for the away team, playing once, but we've kept it bad. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Neil Warnock's first interview since Crystal Palace sacking . Neil Warnock, pictured when he was announced as Crystal Palace manager back in August . Warnock (right) has blamed much of his misfortune as Palace manager on the poor pitch at Selhurst Park . The ex-Palace man was quick to say that the Palace training ground at Beckenham is not up to scratch . 'We've been reported by every team in the Premier League. They [the Palace players] couldn't do the kilometres they've done away from home. It was like running on sand, and that has hampered them.' Alan Pardew, the incoming Palace boss - as revealed by Sportsmail on Monday - will not suffer the same problem, as the Selhurst Park pitch was dug up after Boxing Day, to be replaced before their next home game against Tottenham on January 10th. Warnock went on to explain the other shortcomings he faced in his time at Palace. Christian Benteke celebrates as Aston Villa beat Crystal Palace 1-0 at Selhurst Park at the start of December . Warnock also cited the defeat to Sunderland (pictured) as another low-point of Palace's season so far . 'The infrastructure at Palace is very poor, but Pardew will get time. The training ground is not in the best state. We thought we had a new one a few months ago, but that fell through. The chairman is working very hard. 'All we wanted was a striker and a left-sided defender and we've been looking for a while now. 'When you look at the Premier League. I think they can do it, you know. I think Alan knows what he needs. I think they can finish as high as they did last year. Now Warnock has departed, Alan Pardew (left) will take the reins at Selhurst Park - his old club . Pardew (right) celebrates after scoring the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final in 1990 . 'Quite honestly, you've seen how we played at Spurs and we've played like that most games, We've just been punished at home.' Warnock was sacked with the Eagles languishing in the bottom three of the Premier League. Last season, with Tony Pulis at the helm, they were propelled to 12th, but have failed to find the same form this term. The departing manager though, is happy with the job he did at Selhurst Park. Warnock (centre) understands the criticism he received on Boxing Day for taking off Yannick Bolasie . Steve Parish made a bold move by sacking Warnock after four months, and has appointed Pardew instead . 'Yes, absolutely. The Southampton game I actually just changed the tactics because of the way Southampton played. I was convinced we could go to QPR and win. I were disappointed not to go to QPR, I've never had an opportunity to say goodbye to their fans. At both clubs, I didn't get much chance to bring in players.' 'The crowd had a right go at me (on Boxing Day). I would have had a right go at me, taking Bolasie off at 3-0 down. His wife was having a baby and we had QPR 48 hours later. There was a group that shouted, not thousands and thousands. There were no abuse at the end of the game, Palace fans have been great to me.' And so, that is that. Warnock leaves Palace in the bottom three, but with high aspirations for the rest of the season. According to the ex-Eagles man, Pardew is the right man to move the club forward. In fact, he told him that in August.","Neil Warnock blamed Crystal Palace's poor form on the Selhurst Park pitch .

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder today told the House Judiciary Committee he 'knew nothing' about his agency's possession of two months' worth of phone records from reporters and editors of the Associated Press. Like White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a day earlier, he professed to know little or nothing about the case. California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren told Holder she was frustrated by his Department of Justice's seizure of the phone records, and insisted that notifying the AP could not have threatened the integrity of the investigation into a leak of classified information to a reporter. 'This is both an ongoing matter, and an ongoing matter about which I know nothing,' Holder replied. Scroll down for video . Bosom buddies: President Barack Obama (L) and Eric Holder (C) attended the National Peace Officers Memorial Service on Wednesday just hours before Holder would tell a hostile congressional panel that 'he knew nothing' Laughing it off: both Obama and Holder have gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the scandals lapping at the White house door . ‘It seems to me that the damage to a free press has been substantial,' Lofgren said. The DoJ is also investigating the Internal Revenue Service for targeting conservative groups for special scrutiny after the applied for tax-exempt status. The hearing came barely a half-day after President Obama responded to a report from the IRS Inspector General, which largely exonerated the IRS’s upper management. But Obama’s statement seemed calculated to lay the blame at the IRS’s feet, insulating the White House from reporters’ future questions about responsibility and accountability. Obama called the IRS’s conduct ‘intolerable and inexcusable,’ saying in a statement that ‘[t]he IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity. This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.’ ‘Regardless of how this conduct was allowed to take place,’ Obama said, ‘the bottom line is, it was wrong.’ The Inspector General’s report found that IRS employees in Cincinnati, Ohio, wrongly targeted conservative groups by asking inappropriate questions and justifying them mas part of an investigation into whether the organizations were trying to hide political advocacy behind a façade of public charity. Back off: Holder told the Republican-controlled committee: ''I am not familiar with the reasons why [the case was pursued] in the way that it was, because I¿m simply not a part of the case' Anger: Holder was furious at the hearing that an RNC member had demanded his resignation . The FBI, not the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security, was designated as the lead investigative agency after terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The State Department's second-in-command in Libya at the time of the attack, Greg Hicks, testified in an earlier hearing that it took 'maybe 18 days to get the FBI team to Benghazi' for an investigation to commence . Wisconsin Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner reminded Holder that federal regulations required his agency to inform the press before it seized phone records. Asked why that never happened, Holder replied, 'That I don't know. There are exceptions if the integrity of the investigation would be impacted. I don't know why that didn't happen.' But he defended his staff, despite not knowing the content of their investigation, or where it has led them. 'I have faith in the people who actually were responsible for this case, that they were aware of the rules and that they followed them,' Holder said, 'but I don’t have a factual basis to answer the questions that you have asked, because I was recused.' In particular, Holder said he was 'not familiar' with how the DOJ subpoena was written, or how it was executed. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney took questions from reporters while Holder faced a grilling at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Like Holder, Carney has professed that the White House knows little about the IRS scandal or the AP phone-record seizures, insisting that the president found out about both matters from published news accounts . Democrats seemed equally bothered by the intrusion of government agencies into journalists' press freedoms. Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat and the committee's ranking opposition member, said he was 'deeply troubled by the notion that our government would secretly pursue such a broad array of media phone records over such a long period of time.' Goodlatte opened his questioning by pressing Holder on the DOJ's performance before and after the Boston bombing. The Russian government warned the U.S. about accused bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed days after the bombing in a police shootout. Holder suggested in his testimony that it was other nations, not America's law enforcement officials, who should have done more. 'I'm not at all certain,' he offered, 'that all of the requests that were made to a foreign country by the FBI were replied to in an adequate manner.' On Benghazi, Holder offered a cryptic promise. Federal authorities, he said, have 'taken steps that are definitive and concrete. ... We are prepared to reveal shortly what we have done.' The attorney general did not elaborate. The Justice Department secretly obtained telephone records from April and May of 2012 of reporters and editors for the AP, in what the news outlet's top executive called a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' into how news organizations work . Notably, Holder's prepared testimony didn't address either the IRS investigation or the AP phone records case, likely because neither was yet a political football  by the time his statement was drafted. Congressional testimony given by high-ranking political appointees typically goes through a lengthy vetting process that can take days or even weeks. But under questioning from Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, Holder predicted that the DOJ's investigation into the IRS could involve 'potential civil rights law[breaking],' as well as 'false statement violations.' Smith called the IRS's targeting of tea party groups and other conservative applicants for tax-exempt status 'a threat to our democracy.' Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia also asked about the IRS investigation, suggesting that employees who targeted tea party groups could face felony charges. Holder said he wasn't so sure, although the conduct involved was 'outrageous.' 'To the extent that there are enforcement gaps that we find, we will let this committee know,' he said. BENGHAZI . It allegedly took the FBI 18 days to arrive and set up an investigation after terrorists laid waste to the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, leaving four Americans dead. And few answers have been forthcoming about why the Obama administration has been so tight-lipped about the subsequent investigation. Holder likely knows everything, and Republicans on Capitol Hill want that information. AP PHONE RECORDS . The DOJ secretly obtained the phone records of Associated Press journalists in at least three cities without informing the news bureau beforehand, in order to learn who leaked information about a classified CIA operation. But federal regulations generally require notification of journalists before the government invades their First Amendment freedoms. Holder claims to know nothing, saying that he recused himself from the investigation since he himself was interviewed in connection with the probe. But that begs the question of how anyone at the top levels of the DOJ could investigate the leak without an apparent conflict of interest, since many if not all of them have security clearances sufficient to see the material that was leaked. IRS TARGETING TEA PARTY . The Internal Revenue Service has admitted running a longstanding program that targeted right-wing groups - including those aligned with the politically successful tea party - for extra scrutiny, through delay tactics and intrusive mandatory questionnaires. Holder has announced an investigation, but is tight-lipped about whether he suspects laws were broken. One Republican senator has called for the IRS commissioner to be fired, while the speaker of the House has asked aloud whether anyone is ‘going to jail.’ Since that ‘anyone’ is likely to be a political appointee, Republicans are frustrated at Holder’s coy answers and his claim to know little at this early point in the investigation. BOSTON BOMBING . Holder and other cabinet officials have been criticized for failing to act on warnings from Russia, and perhaps other nations, about the accused Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. And the FBI was lambasted for showing photos of the Tsarnaev brothers publicly instead of asking the Islamic Society of Boston to identify them. Once they saw their photos on television, the brothers ran – shooting a police officer to death in the process.","Department of Justice seized Associated Press phone records without notifying journalists or their editors, and Holder claims to know nothing .

"Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho is looking on the bright side after the champions squandered the chance to close the gap on Chelsea. City blew a chance to move within a point of the Barclays Premier League leaders on Sunday as they surrendered a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with relegation battlers Burnley at the Etihad Stadium. Fernandinho was at a loss to explain City's capitulation but pointed out that no ground was lost on Chelsea - who drew at Southampton - and immediately looked to the next opportunity.

In the first half we played so well, and created so many chances to score, but in the second half we didn't do it. 'It was a result we didn't expect but it happened. We need to keep heads up and think about the next game. It is not over, there are still a lot of games to play. 'It is not a bad result - a bad result is losing. We have one point and we will try to win the next game to get the three points. 'Chelsea drew, we drew and the Premier League is still open. The race for the title is still open. 'It is too early to decide the title now, and we need to keep playing and winning games, and we will see what will happen.' City had a club record 10th successive win in their sights as, again without a recognised striker on the pitch, they controlled the first half. Burnley were not outplayed but there only seemed one result as David Silva struck his fourth in three appearances and Fernandinho doubled the lead with a stunning long-range strike. When Fernandinho's strike went in City looked on course for a routine three points against struggling Burnley . Ashley Barnes' late strike earns a vital point for the visitors, stunning the Etihad crowd . 'I am so happy to score that goal,' said Fernandinho, of his powerful hit that cannoned in off the underside of the bar. 'But unfortunately it was not enough to help us win the game.' City were rocked two minutes into the second half as the Clarets hit back, although there was controversy over George Boyd's 47th-minute strike. The Scot was in offside position as he got the faintest of touches to help a Danny Ings cross-cum-shot past Joe Hart. There was debate over whether Boyd made contact at all but replays indicated that there was and that City were therefore unlucky. But the hosts still let their intensity slip and all the energy after the break came from Burnley. They arguably deserved the point that came their way as Ashley Barnes lashed a fierce drive into the roof of the net nine minutes from time after Jason Shackell had lofted a free-kick into the box. Manuel Pellegrini expresses his frustration to Samir Nasri, as City failed to hold on for three points . Midfielder David Jones chases Fernandinho as Burnley showed energy and endeavour to fight back . The result was not enough to lift them out of the bottom three but the performance offered further proof that they have the wherewithal to survive. Despite a run of just one win in seven games, Burnley have shown their battling qualities of late, not least in their narrow loss to Liverpool on Boxing Day. Midfielder David Jones said: 'From the start of the season we have been growing in belief and here that was evident and proof, if we needed it, that we can compete with anybody. 'It is one of the toughest places, if not the toughest, place to come. There are a lot of positives and we're very happy. 'Outside of our own camp there wouldn't have been much belief that we could get something, especially when we went 2-0 down. 'But that is what the manager has built at this club - a relentless mentality to keep going and see where it leads us at the end of the 90 minutes. That was evident in the second half. We never stopped. 'We felt we could have got more on Boxing Day. We definitely didn't deserve to lose the game, and we felt we should have won it really. 'But to bounce back in this fashion is great for us and gives us that belief to go and do what we have got to do.'","Manuel Pellegrini's team threw away a two-goal lead to draw with Burnley .

"Samir Nasri has warned table-topping Chelsea that his Manchester City team-mates possess the nerve and experience to chase down the league leaders and win the Premier League title. City have secured the trophy in two of the last three seasons and on both occasions, they clawed back the pacesetters as the title race entered the final furlong. In 2012, City were eight points behind Manchester United before reversing the deficit while Manuel Pellegrini’s side were nine behind Liverpool at one stage last season. Samir Nasri says that Manchester City are strong at chasing down league leaders as they did last season . Nasri takes instructions from manager Manuel Pellegrini as City drew 2-2 with Burnley on Sunday . Heading into 2015, City have reduced the gap between themselves and Chelsea from eight to three points. ‘We know that we are good at being second and chasing someone,’ Nasri said. ‘We’ve done it before. We know how to deal with every situation and we are ready for it.’ The in-form Frenchman maintains that City have learned the lessons of their meek title defence during the 2012-13 campaign, when they surrendered their Premier League crown with barely a whimper to Manchester United. City threw away a two-goal lead and missed the chance to close the gap on Chelsea to one point . ‘Yes, we all know what happened and it’s an example for us,’ Nasri added, ‘We learn from our mistakes. We finished 11 or 12 behind United. I know this will not happen. All we want is to win the league again - and we’ll do everything possible to do it again.’ ‘Everyone is stronger. We get older, we get more mature and stronger mentally. You learn to deal with different situations. At this club we’ve been through all the different situations. We know how to deal with the pressure.’ It is a statement that may sound rather hollow after City relinquished a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 against Burnley on Sunday afternoon. Manager Manuel Pellegrini put City’s struggles down to complacency and the tiring effects of a ‘heavy pitch’ at West Brom on Boxing Day. Nasri insists City can have no excuses. George Boyd (above) made it 2-1 before Ashley Barnes equalised . ‘Yes, but it’s not an excuse that we were tired. Look at their team [Burnley], they played exactly the same XI as played against Liverpool. Both teams didn’t have many changes. Sometimes it’s like this and you have to accept it. They played well - a draw was fair.’ City take on Sunderland on New Years Day at the Etihad Stadium and may have to do without Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure, who continue to nurse calf and groin problems respectively. There is, however, some better news on the injury front, with Edin Dzeko hoping to return ahead of schedule. It had initially been feared that the Bosnian frontman would be out until the second half of January after pulling a calf muscle in the warm-up at Leicester City earlier this month. He is now optimistic of returning in time for the trip to Everton on January 10 while Sergio Aguero could yet make the home match against Arsenal the following week.","Manchester City have closed the gap on Chelsea from eight to three points .

"The Manchester City players arrived in a sombre mood as they reported for training on Monday after throwing away two a two goal lead against relegation battlers Burnley. Manuel Pellegrini returned to the drawing board, contemplating on allowing the gap between his side and league leaders Chelsea slip from one point to four. ‘Maybe at 2-0, we thought the game was over,’ the City boss said after the game, ‘Until the final whistle, the game is never finished.’ The Manchester City players reported for training on a chilly Monday morning following their draw to Burnley .

Two goals to the good, City found their lead halved just after the interval as George Boyd netted two minutes after the restart. Quite what Burnley manager Sean Dyche had said to his players at half time is unclear but it must have been inspirational. The Blues then completely switched off and with ten minutes to go Ashley Barnes thundered in the equaliser in front of the stunned onlookers at the Etihad. Pellegrini may be considering turning his focus to team fitness after commenting on City's lack of urgency in the second half. 'We changed our pace or we couldn’t continue at the same pace,’ he said.

"He may be widely recognised as the world's most popular athlete, but that doesn't stop Usain Bolt from getting the jitters when he comes face to face with his sporting idols. Speaking in an interview with Sport Magazine, the 100 metre World Record holder was keen to reveal all about his beloved Manchester United. When speaking about football, conversations with Bolt rarely bypass his burning desire to pull on that famous red jersey... although he thinks that ship may now have sailed with the appointment of new manager Louis van Gaal. The world's fastest man, Jamaica's Usain Bolt, spoke in an interview about his three favourite sports . 'I'd play football for Manchester United, definitely. I'm a winger. I don't know if there's space for me now though,' Bolt said. 'This new coach seems kinda serious!' he added. When given the proposition of watching just three sports for the rest of his life, the 28-year-old's first two answers were a no-brainer: 'Football and track and field.' '(and) I love the NBA, so I'd have to pick that.' An avid sports follower the Jamaican is a huge fan of the NBA, but in contrast to his football loyalties, Boltis open to change when it comes to which team he backs. Bolt said he is a big follower of the NBA and that his favourite player is Brooklyn Nets' Kevin Garnett . 'I basically support whichever team Kevin Garnett is playing for, so right now it's Brooklyn Nets. 'He's a legend, but I hope he's gonna retire soon because I need to support a better team!' Moving on to his more personal matters, the London 2012 three-time gold medalist reminisced on being starstruck for the first time. 'When I first started out in track and field, I went to Manchester United. I was so happy. 'I got to meet Cristiano Ronaldo - who I was a big fan of - and Wayne Rooney. 'Meeting Didier Drogba for the first time was cool, too. What makes it amazing to me is that they actually knew who I was, so that was kind of cool.'

"Andreas Weimann has urged Ron Vlaar and Fabian Delph to stay at Aston Villa. The striker wants the out of contract pair to ignore any potential moves and stick with Paul Lambert's side. Skipper Vlaar and England international Delph, who had an appeal against his red card against Sunderland rejected on Tuesday, have so far not signed new deals at Villa Park. Ron Vlaar is out of contract in the summer and has yet to sign a new deal with Aston Villa . Villa have insisted they will not be sold in January despite their contracts running down and Weimann hopes they will stay long term. He said: 'Ron is our captain so everyone knows he's important so hopefully he'll stay. He's in the middle of our team and we hope he'll stay. 'He knows we all want him to stay and I'm sure the gaffer and everyone else will try and get him to stay.' When asked if Villa's new style could also help convince Delph to stay Weimann added: 'Everyone is enjoying the way we're playing at the moment. We can keep going and keep improving. 'I think at the start of the season we didn't have as much of the ball and we were defending for most of the games but in the last five games we've had more possession than the other teams and I think everyone's enjoying playing out from the back and we're all comfortable doing it.' Fabian Delph was sent off against Sunderland and is also out of contract in the summer . Villa host Crystal Palace on New Year's Day 13th in the Barclays Premier League having lost just twice in their last nine games. They have also only won twice during that spell - including a 1-0 win at Palace - and Weimann is wary of the Eagles, who could have Alan Pardew in charge by Thursday. He said: 'I'm sure they'll be up for the game especially as we beat them at their place and they'll probably want to get one back on us. 'I'm sure we'll be ready and thirsty to get the three points.' Delph will miss that match as he serves the first of a three-game ban following his red card in the goalless draw at home to Sunderland on Sunday. Delph became the third Villa player to be sent off in four games following the red cards shown to Kieran Richardson and Gabby Agbonlahor, who had his red against Manchester United rescinded. Andreas Weimann (right) wants Delph and Vlaar to commit their futures to the Midlands club . The 25-year-old will also miss the crucial clash with Leicester, as well as Villa's third-round FA Cup tie at home to Blackpool. Villa have also only scored seven times at home in the Barclays Premier League, but Weimann is not concerned about their tally. 'You want to score goals in every game. It's about getting the points and if we win 1-0 we're happy with that as well,' he said. The FA has also fined Villa £30,000 for failing to control their players in the wake of Agbonlahor's dismissal against United. A number of Villa players remonstrated with referee Lee Mason after the Villa forward was deemed the guilty party in what appeared to be a fair challenge for the ball between him and United's ex-Villa winger Ashley Young. The FA said Villa had also been warned over their future conduct.","Ron Vlaar and Fabian Delph are yet to sign new deals at Aston Villa .

"Forward Danny Welbeck has stressed Arsenal cannot afford to get ahead of themselves despite having clawed their way back into striking distance of the Barclays Premier League top four. The Gunners battled to a 2-1 win at West Ham on Sunday to leapfrog the home side and move level with Southampton, whom they play at St Mary's Stadium on New Year's Day. It was a fifth victory from the last six matches in all competitions, as despite all of their defensive shortcomings, Arsene Wenger's men are building some momentum, with only one defeat since the end of November. Danny Welbeck celebrates scoring against West Ham to put Arsenal two goals ahead at Upton Park . Welbeck's goal was vital in earning Arsenal all three points, but he insists his team mustn't look too far ahead . Welbeck, who scored Arsenal's second goal just before half-time, insists focus must be completely on the here and now. 'The most important thing for us is to concentrate on the next game because we can't afford to look too far ahead,' Welbeck said. 'We have just got to make sure that we're ready for each and every game.' Welbeck, quoted on Arsenal's website, continued: 'The win (at West Ham) puts us back in amongst it and we need to be further up the table. 'We want to be gaining points and put the pressure on the teams around us.' Despite Cheikhou Kouyate's deflected header, Arsenal held on to win 2-1 and move above their hosts . Alex Song's fabulous volleyed goal had earlier been controversially disallowed for offside . After seeing an early 25-yard effort from former Gunners midfielder Alex Song somewhat controversially ruled out for offside, Arsenal took the lead through a penalty from Santi Cazorla on 41 minutes, with Welbeck sliding in a second at close range just before half-time. Even though Cheikhou Kouyate reduced the deficit at the start of the second half and West Ham had plenty of pressure, the Gunners should have put the result beyond doubt, but were denied several times by in-form goalkeeper Adrian. 'We missed a couple of chances - I had one and some of the other players had one where we could've maybe won the game earlier. That is something we need to improve on,' Welbeck said. Welbeck arrives to tap in from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross, but says Arsenal must be more clinical . The England striker sees his shot drift past West Ham keeper Adrian, as Arsenal failed to take their chances . Arsenal have played the Saints twice already this season, losing in the Capital One Cup, before winning the league match at the start of December. Welbeck said: 'Southampton gave us a difficult test at home and we know how well they have been doing this season, so we have to prepare physically, mentally and tactically right for this game. 'Going into the new year, we want to start it off well.' Arsenal will again be without suspended forward Olivier Giroud at Southampton, where Theo Walcott could be set for a long-awaited start having recovered full fitness. Welbeck is congratulated by his team-mates for the decisive goal, but Arsenal will not be relaxing . Francis Coquelin impressed in midfield as injuries forced Arsenal to rotate their squad yet again . Francis Coquelin, recalled from a loan spell at Charlton, impressed in a defensive midfield role against West Ham, while Tomas Rosicky was given a breather having suffered calf and hamstring cramps after a rare start on Boxing Day, so could be available again. Wenger, meanwhile, insisted there was 'nothing concrete' in reports German forward Lukas Podolski was set to leave for Inter Milan in January. 'At the moment nobody goes out,' the Arsenal manager said. 'We have (Mesut) Ozil coming back now at the beginning of January, so of course there is a lot of competition up front.'","Danny Welbeck scored second in a 2-1 win over West Ham on Sunday .

"Wigan Athletic's loss to Sheffield Wednesday at the DW Stadium was overshadowed by the news returning striker Grant Holt faces up to a year on the sidelines with a suspected cruciate knee ligament injury. The 10-man Latics were beaten 1-0 by the Owls in their final game of 2014 and will begin the new calendar year in the Sky Bet Championship's bottom three. Their failings in front of goal were all too evident in a third straight home loss and Mackay had hoped Holt, who was sent on loan to Huddersfield after falling out with previous boss Uwe Rosler, could remedy some of their problems in attack. Wigan Athletic's Grant Holt, pictured against Huddersfield n October, suffered suspected cruciate knee ligament damage during the 1-0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday on Tuesday . However, Mackay revealed the 33-year-old would be unable to spearhead any possible Wigan revival after suffering a serious injury in his final loan game with the Terriers at Rotherham on Boxing Day. 'We scanned his injury late last night and it's pretty devastating, he's going to be out for nine to 12 months with a knee injury,' Mackay said.

"Ron Harris has sympathy with officials and believes players throughout the Premier League - and not just at Chelsea - must take it upon themselves to stamp out the 'disease' of simulation. The issue reared its ugly head once more when Jose Mourinho said Chelsea were subject of a sustained campaign following Cesc Fabregas' yellow card for diving at Southampton on Sunday. Harris, who made a club record 795 appearances for Chelsea and was nicknamed 'Chopper' for his no-nonsense style, thinks Fabregas and Mourinho were right to feel aggrieved after the midfielder was booked following a tackle from Matt Targett. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas smiles in disbelief after being booked for a dive against Southampton . Spain star Fabregas appeared to be caught by Saints' young defender Matt Targett at St Mary's on Sunday . Harris said: 'You've only got to look at the young lad that made the tackle - I'm sure he was relieved the referee didn't give a penalty. 'It's a very difficult job refereeing today. It's easy to sit there in the TV studio and say 'he's got this decision wrong'. 'Everybody makes mistakes, but they're being highlighted at the moment. 'Players, in every level of football, seem to go down very easily nowadays compared to what they used to. Ron Harris, pictured tackling George Best in 1971, was well known for his uncompromising style on the pitch . Chelsea legend Harris believes diving has become a disease on the English game in recent years . 'For the last three or four years there's been a disease in football where people fall very easily. 'The only people that will stop it are the players themselves.' Harris is also infuriated by the set-piece grappling which takes place in the penalty areas. If referees use the rules at their disposal - like when Stoke's Ryan Shawcross was penalised by Michael Oliver for hauling down Wilfried Bony of Swansea in October - Harris believes the practice will be outlawed. 'That's the only way they will stop it,' Harris said.","Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against Southampton .

"Wayne Rooney believes it will take a serious injury before the Premier League bow to demands to overhaul the traditional festive schedule. In joining the clamour criticising the fixture congestion, the Manchester United captain also claimed supporters are being short-changed by attending matches between exhausted teams. United boss has Louis van Gaal has been among the most vocal critics of the Christmas fixtures, which saw sides play twice in 48 hours from Boxing Day. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has blasted the Premier League's hectic festive schedule . Rooney (right) and Radamel Falcao (left) look on during the match with Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday - just two days after Boxing Day fixtures, which the former believes will only change once a serious injury is suffered . The Dutchman followed United’s 0-0 draw with Tottenham Hotspur with the claim that it is ‘scientifically proven the body cannot recover in 48 hours’, and Rooney has now gone even further in calling for change. ‘It will probably take someone getting a really bad injury from doing it (playing twice in two days), which no-one wants to see,’ Rooney said. ‘But it is very demanding and I think it does need looking at. ‘As a player you want to play. It is tough, but you want to play and try to help the team win. Juan Mata was the only United player whose running stats dipped significantly over the two games . Radamel Falcao failed to score, and did not impress in the match at White Hart Lane on Sunday . ‘If you look at all the games (on December 28), towards the end they will all lose a lot of quality.’ Rooney added: ‘With the weather as well, and the fans coming from London or travelling from Manchester, it has been tough. It is a lot of money to spend over Christmas. ‘But it is what it is, we have to deal with that and have to try and perform well.’ United blew a good chance to make up ground on league leaders Chelsea on Sunday, but after dominating the first half they wilted badly in the second. Phil Jones (on floor) looks on as his header goes over the line but the goal was disallowed for offside . Manchester United failed to score, even when the ball scrambled around the Tottenham box in the first half . Van Gaal directly attributed the drop-off to fatigue and Rooney said: ‘It is not easy playing two games in two days and you do lose a lot of the quality from both teams. ‘We started so well first half but in the second half it was tough and hopefully in the future it has to change because it is tough.’ A change could be forced if 14 of the 20 top-flight clubs pushed for it, though such gripes have not escalated to that level of discussion in the past. Louis van Gaal has bemoaned the Christmas fixtures, and says that 48 hours is not enough time to recover . Hugo Lloris makes himself big to deny Robin van Persie as United spurned several great chances . While Rooney made his unhappiness public, team-mate Phil Jones says that fatigue is just an annual by-product of the festive fixtures and refused to use it as an excuse. ‘You have to do it,’ Jones told MUTV. ‘I think fatigue is always going to kick in with two games in three days but it’s the same for every club in the Premier League.’ United will be boosted by the return to the fitness of Ander Herrera for their New Year’s Day trip to Stoke as the £30million midfielder recovers from a muscle injury.

"Real Madrid have had a year to remember as they sit at the peak of the La Liga table during the Christmas break. The Spanish giants have won their last 22 consecutive games in all competitions with Gareth Bale chipping in with 10 goals in those encounters. Therefore many wouldn't be too aggrieved at the Real players for wanting to take a bit of a break over the festive period... but Bale does not plan on stopping. Gareth Bale took to his Twitter account to post a picture of him doing some night time training on Tuesday .

Looking rather chilly as he posted a picture to his Twitter on Tuesday night, Bale said: 'Enjoying the Christmas period, and a bit of late night training. Got to stay on this winning streak!!' Since his £85million move from Tottenham, the 25-year-old has already won four trophies in his time at the Spanish club - the Champions League, Spanish Cup, Euro Super Cup and, this week, the Club World Cup. That said, his efforts to remain on top of his game may not be fully appreciated by everybody at the Bernabeu, with 54% of fans saying they would happily see the Welsh star sold to the highest bidder. With Real Madrid supporters supposedly happy to let Gareth Bale leave if a bid of more than €150million was tabled, and Manchester United reportedly sniffing around, maybe Louis van Gaal is keeping a close eye on Bale's efforts.

"Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar is desperate to end his injury struggles and reignite his season. The Dutch skipper has just returned from over a month out with a thigh problem and had already been suffering with a calf injury this season. He has made just nine appearances for Villa this term and has seen Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore form a solid partnership in defence. Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar holds of Manchester United forward Radamel Falcao during the 1-1 draw . But Vlaar returned to start in a back three with Clark and Okore for the 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Saturday. The trio are expected to line up together at Swansea on Boxing Day and Vlaar is eager to finally cement himself back in the side. 'It's been a strange season - played a few games, injured, played a few games, injured,' said the Holland international. 'So let's hope I stay fit now. I believe in that. I trust in that. 'With the team it's going quite well to be honest. It's been hard to sit in the stands and watch the games when I've been injured but it's great to be back and it was good to play a full 90 minutes on Saturday. The Dutch international admitted it has been difficult watching his side from the stands while injured . 'Let's push on now for more. It's too bad that we lost our unbeaten run against West Brom but let's hope we started it again on Saturday. 'Against United, we had some opportunities at the end. We were a little bit unlucky. 'We worked really hard. It was really good to be part of it. If we do that in every game, we will be hard to beat. 'I am used to the three-man defence. In the summer we did the same with the national team. We did it a few times last year too.' Vlaar is challenged by Alan Hutton during a training session ahead of the Boxing day clash with Swansea . Okore has returned this season after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury last term and Vlaar praised the Denmark international on his comeback. 'I think Jores and Ciaran are doing well. I have been pleased to see that, especially with Jores after his tough season last year with the big injury he had,' Vlaar told Villa's official site. 'He has now come back and he's a great player. 'It's not always been easy for Ciaran but I really think he stepped up and did great. 'I think I had to be lucky that the manager chose three central defenders. 'Everyone is pushing everyone else forward which is great for the team and will improve us.'","Ron Vlaar has suffered from numerous injuries this season .

"These terrifying pictures show children as young as five being trained to kill with pistols and deadly AK-47 assault rifles. They were taken from footage of an al Qaeda terror camp in north Waziristan, near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

Child soldiers: Children as young as five are being trained to become soldiers for al Qaeda. This image shows them being drilled in the use of firearms . They are brainwashed into waging Jihad on the West and becoming suicide bombers, the Sunday Mirror reported. It was posted on an underground al Qaeda website and issued by the Turkistan Islamic Party, which trains fighters to fight alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan. It is believed the armed group is responsible for more than 200 acts of ­terrorism worldwide in the past 20 years, the paper reported. Troubled region: Pakistani army soldiers in Waziristan, where they wage a bloody war with militants . Terrorism expert Neil Doyle said: 'The video is part of disturbing trend.

'These children are living a very bleak existence. There is growing evidence that many are forced into it.' The Pakistani Taliban is one of many loosely allied extremist groups that operate in Pakistan's tribal region. It wants to impose the same kind of hardline interpretation of Islamic law as the Afghan Taliban that ruled Afghanistan until the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ousted the hardline regime for sheltering al Qaeda's leaders.

"James McClean set up one and scored another to hand Malky Mackay his first win as Wigan manager. The Republic of Ireland international provided the centre for Liam Cooper’s comical early own goal and then thrashed in a late second to get former Cardiff boss Mackay off the mark at the sixth attempt. Mackay’s Wigan came into the contest six points adrift of safety in their fight against relegation and with just one victory in their last 17 Championship matches. Wigan's James McClean (centre) is congratulated after his cross was turned in by Leeds' Liam Cooper (right) - McLean then thrashed in a second for Wigan to record their first win under manager Malky Mackay . Their previous points haul under the Scot stood at an anaemic one and his drastic action in response to their recent home defeat to Rotherham was to drop three of their 2013 FA Cup-winning team – Emmerson Boyce, Shaun Maloney and Callum McManaman – among four changes and switch to a back three. Yet the visiting players had barely had time to get used to the new wing-backs system when they were gifted an 11th-minute lead. McClean’s pace down the left flank saw him outstrip Giuseppe Bellusci and although his cross from the byline suggested little danger, Cooper inexplicably chested the ball into his own net attempting to tidy things up. Wigan had lost their previous four away trips in the league but with a rare advantage to defend restricted Leeds to minimal sights of their goal in the remainder of the opening period. In fact, Scott Carson, who made his debut for Leeds during their life as a Premier League club, was not tested at all in the visitors’ goal. LEEDS (4-4-2): Silvestri 7; Byram 7, Bellusci 6, Cooper 5, Warnock 6; Bianchi 6 (Morison 46mins, 6), Tonge 6, Cook 7, Mowatt 6 (Austin 46mins, 7); Sharp 6 (Doukara 71mins), Antenucci 7 . Subs (Not used): Taylor, Pearce, Berardi, Montenegro . WIGAN (3-5-2): Carson 8; Perch 7, Ramis 7, Kiernan 7; Tavernier 6, Cowie 6, Watson 6, McCann 6, Taylor 6; McClean 8, Fortune 6 (Espinoza 70 mins, 6) Subs (Not used): Al-Habsi, Riera, Maloney, McManaman, Boyce, Forshaw . Referee: Nigel Miller 7 . And on the only occasion they did beat their former goalkeeper, Mirco Antenucci’s dink into the area on 28 minutes was glanced onto the crossbar from a flick of strike partner Billy Sharp’s head. The complexion of the game changed after the interval as Leeds manager Neil Redfearn reacted to a lack of urgency and re-shaped his own team, sacrificing the Football League’s young player of the month Alex Mowatt and Tomasso Bianchi to employ Steve Morison in a three-man attack with fellow substitute Rodolph Austin offering a more direct running option from midfield. Those changes provided Leeds with greater intensity and that was evident almost immediately as Lewis Cook’s burst into the box set up Antenucci only for a deflection to save Wigan. Then, from the resulting corner – one of seven in the opening quarter-hour of the second period – Bellusci latched onto a half-clearance to force Carson into a spectacular tip-over from a 20-yard drive. However, their purple patch failed to yield an equalizer and McClean – who was foiled by Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri’s legs with a rare shot with his right foot – sealed it with his left eight minutes from time when Wigan made the most of their superior numbers on a breakaway.","Leeds' Liam Cooper scored an own goal in the 11th minute .

"The Premier League's decision to broadcast live matches on Friday nights has been criticised by the Football League for clashing with a slot which has traditionally been used for lower-league games. The Friday night games - up to 10 matches a season - are part of the Premier League's new invitation to tender (ITT) for the domestic TV rights for the 2016-2019 seasons. Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey - who also announced that no clubs other than Blackburn, Leeds and Nottingham Forest will have Financial Fair Play transfer embargoes for January - said he understood the pressures on the Premier League but labelled the move 'disappointing' and 'frustrating'.

Football League CEO Shaun Harvey says Friday night Premier League games will hurt the lower tiers . Michael Owen and Steve McManaman in their roles as pundits for BT Sport . Harvey said: 'The Premier League's tender document includes an increased number of live matches and an intention to broadcast up to 10 matches on a Friday evening, which is obviously disappointing as this slot has traditionally been used by the Football League for its own televised matches. 'While it's frustrating and will make our job of meeting our own contractual commitments harder, we do nevertheless understand the pressures that are building on the fixture calendar.' Harvey blamed the demands of the Champions League and Europa League for adding to the pressure on domestic competitions. Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville feature as part of their coverage of 116 games this season . Sky Sports currently have the rights to broadcast a Premier League match on Monday nights . He added: 'They [the pressures] are being created mainly by the expansion of European club competitions because leagues are prohibited from broadcasting their matches on the same night. In addition, it means that Premier League clubs in European competitions cannot play in televised domestic matches on a Monday evening. 'In any event, the broadcasting of Premier League matches on a Friday night at the level being proposed will always be more preferable than the idea of the entire Premier League fixture schedule being shown live, or matches being shown at 3pm on a Saturday, as this could have catastrophic consequences for our clubs.' Harvey blamed the demands of European competitions the Champions League, won last season by Gareth Bale's Real Madrid, and the Europa League for adding to the pressure on domestic competitions . In terms of financial fair play, Harvey said only the trio of clubs announced on December 15 will be subject to transfer embargoes. A decision is expected in the first half of January on whether promoted clubs QPR and Leicester will be fined.

"Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert believes Saturday's opponents Manchester United can still win the Barclays Premier League title this season despite a poor start to the campaign. Louis van Gaal's side are clearly outsiders to lift the trophy after the Dutch coach's bedding-in period left them eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who are fighting it out with Manchester City at the top. United have looked suspect in defence for much of the season but recent signs of improvement have convinced Lambert they should not be written off. Manchester United go in to Saturday's game against Aston Villa off the back of a 3-0 win over Liverpool . It was United's sixth straight Premier League win to leave them third in the table . 'They might not be able to lose many more games if they are going to win the title but they're certainly in with a shout,' said the Villa boss. 'It is still a brilliant club with great players. The players they have brought in, there are not many teams in world football who can do that. They're a really good side.' The Red Devils have now won six matches in a row to significantly close the gap between themselves and their two rivals and now look a lot healthier than they did under David Moyes last season. 'Just because they've changed managers doesn't change my thinking of that football club,' Lambert added.

"David Cameron’s handling of the Brussels’ £1.7 billion surcharge demand has been strongly backed by the public, according to a Mail on Sunday poll . David Cameron’s handling of the row over Brussels’ £1.7 billion surcharge demand has been strongly backed by the public, a poll for today’s Mail on Sunday has found. As a political storm raged over the deal, which the Government claimed had halved the bill to £850 million, the Survation poll found that 42 per cent of voters agreed it was ‘a result for Britain’ – against 33 per cent who disagreed. And a substantial 35 per cent of voters thought that if Labour leader Ed Miliband had been Prime Minister he would have secured a worse deal, compared with only 11 per cent who thought he would have done better. The findings came as Chancellor George Osborne fought back against critics’ claims that Friday’s deal had been a synthetic victory achieved by ‘smoke and mirrors’. During a heated interview on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Osborne denied the accusation that the reduction had only been achieved by bringing forward a rebate the UK was already expecting. ‘It took a lot of hard discussion, a lot of hard negotiation and it shows that when this Government sets out a goal in Europe it goes and achieves it,’ said Mr Osborne. He insisted it was ‘not clear’ the £1.7m rebate was going to apply to the surcharge, which was demanded after a recalculation of Britain’s income relative to the other member states. ‘The truth is, as always, we have achieved a real win for British taxpayers, and having achieved it everyone says, “Oh, of course you were always going to achieve that.” ‘It was a real doubt about whether the rebate would apply… we have got this bill halved.’ Asked if Britain's contributions to the EU were value for money, he replied: 'I don't think we get full value for money for all those pounds that get sent to the European Union.' Twenty-five per cent of voters say Friday’s deal has made them more confident in Mr Cameron’s ability to win concessions, compared with 22 per cent who said it made them less confident. Labour has claimed the deal does not save the UK 'a single penny' and accused Mr Osborne and the Prime Minister of 'trying to take the British people for fools'. George Osborne has defended the deal that will leave Britain paying an extra £850 million towards the European Union budget . Despite the scepticism, the poll also found that the deal has marginally boosted support for Mr Cameron’s stance over the EU referendum he has pledged to hold if he wins the General Election next May. Mr Cameron says he will campaign for Britain to stay in the EU if he can negotiate concessions from Brussels over issues such as immigration. The Chancellor's European counterparts also appeared to contradict the Chancellor's account of the deal. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said he believed that the UK 'will pay the whole amount' while Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said 'it's not as if the British have been given a discount'. Polish Finance Minister Mateusz Szczurek (L), George Osborne and European Commissioner Jonathan Hill (R) at the start of a European finance ministers meeting at EU Commission headquarters, in Brussels yesterday . Attack: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls responded to the deal by saying: 'David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to take the British people for fools' The European Commission's vice-president with responsibility for the budget, Kristalina Georgieva, said the additional contribution being demanded from the UK meant that its rebate was also increased, leading to a 'downward correction' in the overall sum to be paid. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said on Twitter: 'David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to take the British people for fools. 'Ministers have failed to get a better deal for the British taxpayer. Not a single penny has been saved for the taxpayer compared to two weeks ago when David Cameron was blustering in Brussels. 'By counting the rebate Britain was due anyway, they are desperately trying to claim that the backdated bill for £1.7 billion has somehow been halved. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and Ukip leader Nigel Farage laid into George Osborne on Twitter yesterday . 'But nobody will fall for this smoke and mirrors. The rebate was never in doubt and, in fact, was confirmed by the EU Budget Commissioner last month.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage also weighed into the debate, posting on Twitter: 'Osborne (is) trying to spin his way out of disaster. UK still paying full £1.7 billion, his credibility is about to nose-dive. 'Borrowing what we are rightfully owed in the future to pay an unfair bill being levied now is not a victory. It's a sham.' The poll found that support for leaving the EU is at 54 per cent, while just 31 per cent want to remain. Criticism: Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'Osborne (is) trying to spin his way out of disaster. UK still paying full £1.7 billion, his credibility is about to nose-dive.","42% in poll agreed it was 'a result for Britain', against 33% who disagreed .

"World leaders attending the G20 Summit have been promised tougher security across Queensland's international airports ahead of and during the event in November. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has made the announcement today, as part of the government's roll-out of counter terrorism measures. ‘The future outlook for Australia’s borders is very challenging, more than ever before ensuring the security and integrity of our borders is essential,' Mr Morrison said. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison says G20 delegates will be protected by Australia's tougher border protection and counter terrorism measures . Federal Police will be one of nine agencies involved in reporting to the Strategic Border Command headquarters in Canberra . 'The regional command in Queensland, its footprint is significant. 'It is responsible for 14 ports, 3 major international airports and the facilitation of up to 4000 delegates expected to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November. 'To stay ahead of these growing threats it is important that the government not only talks the talk but walks the walk,' he said. The Immigration Minister was speaking at the launch of the Customs and Border Protection Regional Command in Brisbane. 'There needs to be a strong command, an arrangement in place, that all the resources are well managed and are well directed and fused together with our other law enforcement agencies. 'This is a critical step in the creation of the border force. It ensures better monitoring of our borders 24/7 in real time from the (Strategic Border Command) headquarters in Canberra.' 'The regional command in Queensland is significant, it is responsible for 14 ports, 3 major international airports and the facilitation of up to 4000 delegates expected to attend the G20 Summit' says Immigration Minister Scott Morrison . Mr Morrison said this link, which includes live operational pictures beamed back to the HQ in the nation's capital, guarantees that resources will be 'deployed as they are needed'. He pointed to the scale of control required by the local command, which on average will oversee 126,000 plane passengers and and crew travelling internationally each week, along with 3300 air cargo consignments and hundreds of sea cargo and cruise ships every week. 'There are five regional commands around the country, 3000 plus officers who form part of the national force,' Mr Morrison said. Mr Morrison says bolstered surveillance of airports and borders will allow officers 'to focus their attention on other matters' including the apprehending of terror suspects .

Denyse Sweeney, a mother-of-two from Derby, died in hospital after collapsing in a bar in Anjuna, Goa, in April 2010. Local officials said the 34-year-old passed away after bingeing on illegal drugs. But an inquest at Derby Coroner's Court in April was told that no illegal substances were found in her system. It . was also revealed that she had 20 bruises on her body at the time of . death, including one measuring 4.5cm on the back of her skull. Pathologist . Dr Ivan Robinson was unable to give a cause of death and coroner Dr . Robert Hunter said the unexplained injuries 'were not investigated to . any satisfactory level' by the authorities in Goa. Returning . an open verdict on her death, Derby and South Derbyshire coroner Dr . Hunter said: 'There are a number of unexplained injuries but it is not . clear how they were caused. 'It is clear they came about from a sort of trauma but whether violence was involved we cannot be sure.'

Last night, the news finally came through that police in Goa are now looking into the case. The . Times Of India today reported: 'The Anjuna police will now investigate . the case of a British woman who died mysteriously in April 2010 as . murder.'

Every day for the last two years, . Maureen and another sister Marion have written letters and made phone . calls to Goa, to the Foreign Office, to MPs and ministers, trying to . prompt a murder investigation. Now they are waiting to hear from Foreign Secretary William Hague. A letter is said to be on its way. Derby South MP Margaret Beckett, who met with the family, used her contacts to help them. The former Foreign Secretary said: . 'I'm very pleased to hear the news the family have had.

"It happens to us all – you fill up the kettle to make a quick cup of tea, and then have to wait ages for it to boil. But that frustration could soon be a thing of the past with a device that heats the exact amount of water you need for your cuppa...by boiling it in the mug. This means that not only does the device save time, it also saves energy. To heat water, a mug is placed on a special induction plate and a magnetic metal rod is immersed in it. Scroll down for video . The Miito is the brainchild of young entrepreneurs Nils Chudy (left) and Jasmina Grase (right) The device heats the exact amount of water a person needs for a cuppa by boiling it in the mug . The base creates an electromagnetic field that causes the water around the rod to heat up. And if you have guests over and want to make more than one cup – just place your teapot on the device, called a Miito, and it works in the same energy-efficient way. According to the Energy Saving Trust, if everyone boiled only the water they need, they would save enough electricity to power the nation’s street lights for two months. Its makers also claim the Miito is quieter than a normal kettle and produces less limescale. And it works for any other liquids such as milk, and even soup. The Miito is the brainchild of young entrepreneurs Nils Chudy and Jasmina Grase, former students of the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands. They set out to redesign the kettle after realising the amount of energy that’s wasted each time it is put on to boil and hailed Miito as an ‘innovative product that eliminates the heating of excess water’. Efficient: Miito (pictured) could play a small role in energy conservation in the kitchen beacuse unlike a regular kettle, it only heats water that is needed. It can be used to heat any liquid, such as coffee and milk . The Miito gadget uses induction to heat liquid. It comprises a metal rod, which is placed into a cup of liquid and an induction plate, which is used like a coaster underneath the cup. The base contains a coil though which a high frequency alternating current is passed and creates an electromagnetic field. The heat induced in this base - where 'eddy' currents within the metal and resistance lead to it heating up - is transferred to the liquid in a cup via the metal rod inside it, which gets hot. Induction heating is faster and more efficient that other methods and heats liquid more consistently. Mr Chudy, 23, from Berlin, Germany, said: ‘Miito all started with looking at electric kettles and noticing they all look so similar. Later, while researching electric kettles more closely, we noticed that there was a major design flaw. ‘They are extremely wastefully designed – the minimum fill line of the majority of kettles is at approximately 500ml which means that if you want one cup of tea, around 250ml, you waste 50 per cent of the hot water. 'We set out to redesign the electric kettle from the ground up, to change people’s habits of overfilling electric kettles in order to save energy. Miito is efficient because you only heat the amount of water you need saving time and energy. 'There’s no limescale to worry about and you can use it with any vessel and any liquid.’ The pair are now looking at ways of mass-producing their kettles, and hope to sell them for around £80 once they hit the shelves. Quiet: The device is quieter than a normal kettle and produces less limescale, according to its inventors, Nils Chudy and Jasmina Grase. Here, the two components - the metallic rod and induction plate - are pictured .

"Petrol prices could fall to £1 a litre for the first time in five years if a slump in the market continues, one of Britain's leading drivers' lobbyists has claimed. Professor Stephen Glaister, head of the RAC Foundation, said although the 'tantalising' prospect was still distant it had been made thinkable by plunging crude oil prices. The cost of a barrel has fallen from more than $90 a barrel six weeks ago to a three-year low of $78, prompting a new push by politicians for supermarkets to slash pump prices. Slump: RAC Foundation chief Stephen Glaister (left) raised the 'distant' but 'tantalising' prospect of petrol falling below £1 a litre in a week where Danny Alexander (right) called on retailers to cut prices at the pumps . The call by Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander intensified competition between Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s - all of which cut petrol prices by around 1p on Wednesday. Across the country pump prices already stand at their lowest level in around four years. Prof Glaister told The Sunday Telegraph: 'When oil was last at $60 a barrel in spring 2009, the price of petrol stood at just under £1 a litre. 'Rising VAT and fuel duty rates need to be factored in, along with changes to the exchange rate, but a continued fall in crude prices raises the tantalising – though distant – prospect of getting change from a quid for every litre you buy.' Crude oil prices shot to record levels of $140 a barrel in summer 2008, months before the collapse of the bank Lehman Brothers gave the first signs of a global financial crisis. Ups and downs: How crude oil prices fluctuated in the last ten years, hitting a peak in 2008 before the crash . Petrol prices have already fallen sharply in recent weeks, but ministers believe they should drop further . Just a year later oil prices dipped below $45 a barrel, prompting motorists to call on sellers to slash prices in return. Since then oil prices have gradually risen and hovered around $100 for the last few years until they dropped below $80 a barrel again this month. The fall in prices prompted a war of words this week between politicians - who urged petrol retailers to drop prices - and the retailers themselves, who said fuel duty should be slashed. Asda petrol fell to 119.7p a litre and diesel to 123.7p, the first time its petrol had dipped under 120p in four years. Shell insisted it was ‘doing its bit’ to keep pump prices low but added: 'Crude oil costs account only for about one third of the price at the pump – tax and duty on fuel account for almost two thirds.' Brian Madderson, of the Petrol Retailers’ Association, said it had tried for weeks to discuss the issue with the Treasury adding that ‘to criticise the industry without speaking to us is grossly unfair’. But Mr Alexander warned: ‘When the price of oil falls, the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone, not a feather’. Luke Bosdet of the AA said that while supermarkets were leading the price cuts, ‘fuel prices … are not moving fast enough’.","Prof Stephen Glaister said prospect was thanks to falling crude oil prices .

"Bird-like plumage have originally evolved in dinosaurs for courtship displays rather than flight, new findings suggest. The evidence comes from the first feathered dinosaurs to be discovered in North America. Researchers in Canada found evidence of feathers in a juvenile and two adult fossils of ornithomimus, a species within the ornithomimid group. Plumage: An artist's impression of the feathered ornithomimid dinosaurs found in Alberta, Canada . Researchers from the Royal Tyrrell . Museum of Palaeontology, and the University of Calgary made the . discovery in 75million-year-old rocks in the badlands of southern . Alberta. Ornithomimids were previously thought . to have been hairless, fast-running birds, and were depicted as such in . the Hollywood dinosaur blockbuster Jurassic Park. 'The discovery, the first to establish . the existence of feathers in ornithomimids, suggests that all . ostrich-like dinosaurs had feathers,' according to a statement from the . Alberta museum. Tyrannosaurus Rex used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off Triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures, a new theory claims. Research into Triceratops fossils from the U.S. shows that the Jurassic apex predator first slew its prey, then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient-rich neck meat hidden by body armour. Tyrannosaurus was well known to feed on the Triceratops but until now few have questioned how it got around the herbivore's tough neck frill. The study presented last week as the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's annual meeting, and reported in Nature, looked for an answer by examining bite-scarred Triceratops bones. The museum said the specimens revealed . that the dinosaurs had a base of down-like feathers throughout their . lifetime while older ones developed feathers on their arms, . approximating wings. But the dinosaurs would have been too . large to fly, so the plumage might have been employed to attract a mate . or in the protection of eggs during hatching. The findings by paleontologists . Francois Therrien, curator at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, and Darla . Zelenitsky, assistant professor at the University of Calgary, will be . published on Friday in Science, a leading journal. 'This pattern differs from that seen . in birds, where the wings generally develop very young, soon after . hatching,' said Dr Zelenitsky, lead researcher on the study. Dr Therrien added: 'The fact that . wing-like forelimbs developed in more mature individuals suggests they . were used only later in life, perhaps associated with reproductive . behaviours like display or egg-brooding.' The fossils were discovered in . sandstone and were the first feathered dinosaur specimens found in North . America, according to the museum statement. Until now feathered dinosaur skeletons have been found almost exclusively in fine-grained rocks in China and Germany. 75million years old: The skeleton of an ornithomimid dinosaur with preserved evidence of fossil feathers. Scientists say they are the first dinosaur fossils to show evidence of feathers found in north America . 'It was previously thought that . feathered dinosaurs could only fossilise in muddy sediment deposited in . quiet waters, such as at the bottom of lakes and lagoons,' said Dr . Therrien. 'But the discovery of these . ornithomimids in sandstone shows that feathered dinosaurs can also be . preserved in rocks deposited by ancient flowing rivers.' Sandstone is the type of rock that . most commonly preserves dinosaur bones, making it likely that more . feathered dinosaurs will be found around the world, said the scientists.","Evidence from first feathered dinosaur remains found in North America .

"Top police officers were accused yesterday of suffering ‘collective amnesia’ about their failure to investigate the hacking of Milly Dowler’s phone. The Surrey Police force was severely criticised over the actions of senior detectives investigating the schoolgirl’s murder. An independent watchdog found there was knowledge of the hacking ‘at all levels’ of the team investigating the case. Surrey's deputy chief constable . Craig Denholm (left) was today disciplined for failing to 'assess material sent to him' about the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone, but a misconduct case was dropped . Tributes: Craig Denholm (left) stands with Bob and Sally Dowler, Milly's parents, who said because her voicemail messages disappeared they believed she was alive - in fact her her phone had been hacked . Its head, Craig Denholm, even . received documents mentioning it but nothing was done for almost a . decade, when the phone-hacking scandal exploded. The News of the World told Surrey . Police that it had accessed Milly’s mobile phone messages within weeks . of her disappearance in March 2002. A former Surrey police officer has been arrested in connection with the investigation into alleged payments to public officials. The . 41-year-old man was arrested at 6am this morning at his home in Sussex . on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, Scotland Yard said. The . former officer, who is being interviewed at a Sussex police station, . was arrested by officers from Operation Elveden - Scotland Yard’s . investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials. The . arrest is the 62nd under Operation Elveden, which is being supervised . by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and is running in . conjunction with Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard’s inquiry into . phone-hacking. He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 8. But there was no investigation at the . time. It was only after the Met launched Operation Weeting nine years . later that  Milly’s parents were told her phone had been hacked. The scandal exploded into the public . consciousness with the inaccurate claim in the Guardian newspaper that . the News of the World had also deliberately deleted messages on Milly’s . phone, giving her parents false hope that she may still have been alive. The backlash sparked the Leveson Inquiry and calls for a new system of . Press regulation. However, it was later established that the messages had almost certainly been deleted automatically by the phone company. Questions have been repeatedly raised . over why police did not act in 2002, something which could have stemmed . phone hacking in its infancy. Their silence was seen by a tiny minority of journalists as a tacit admission that phone hacking was not illegal. Yesterday, the Independent Police . Complaints Commission said current and former senior officers were . unable to explain why nothing was done over the hacking 11 years ago. Deborah Glass, of the IPCC, said ‘phone hacking was a crime and this should have been acted upon’. She suggested that if Surrey Police . had investigated the Sunday newspaper’s actions, it may have stopped . phone hacking in its tracks.

April: Shortly before the trial of Levi Bellfield for Milly’s murder, police tell her parents that her mobile phone may have been hacked. July 4: The Guardian reports that the News of the World hacked Milly’s phone and – inaccurately – that messages were deleted, giving her parents ‘false hope’ that she was alive. July 10: The News of the World is shut down. December 12: A Metropolitan Police lawyer tells the Leveson Inquiry it is ‘unlikely’ that journalists erased messages from Milly’s phone. 2012 – May 9: The Leveson Inquiry is told that the truth about how Milly’s phone messages were deleted may never emerge, and it probably happened automatically. 2013 – April 24: A highly critical Independent Police Complaints Commission report reveals that ‘all levels’ of Surrey Police had knowledge of the 2002 phone hacking but did nothing. Instead, the illicit practice . continued until it was exposed in 2011, sparking a national scandal, the . closure of the News of the World and the Leveson Inquiry into media . standards. Animal: Levi Bellfield abducted and murdered the 13-year-old after she walked past his home . Mrs Glass added: ‘We have not been . able to uncover any evidence, in documentation or witness statements, of . why and by whom that decision was made. ‘Former senior officers, in . particular, appear to have been afflicted by a form of collective . amnesia in relation to the events of 2002. ‘This is perhaps not surprising, . given the events of 2011 and the public outcry that the hacking of Milly . Dowler’s phone produced. ‘However, it is scarcely credible . that no one connected to the Milly Dowler investigation recognised the . relevance and importance of the information Surrey Police held in 2002.’ Former nightclub doorman Levi . Bellfield was convicted of murdering Milly and sentenced to a whole life . tariff in June 2011. Several weeks later the phone-hacking scandal . broke. In the ensuing furore, Surrey Police . set up an inquiry to look into claims officers were aware that the News . of the World intercepted her voicemail. It soon emerged that journalists had volunteered information about their illegal actions but police did not investigate. Yesterday, the IPCC said that in 2002 . the force’s focus was finding the missing girl but noted claims of an . ‘unhealthy relationship’ with the media. Officials said they could not find . evidence to disprove Mr Denholm’s claim that he did not know and did not . make the ‘relevant connections’. Probe: Deputy Chief Constable Craig Denholm, . left, and Temporary Detective Superintendent Maria Woodall, right, have been given warnings by their force . Operation Weeting: Probe into phone hacking. Set up in January 2011 it has 96 officers working on it and has cost £11.2million so far. Operation Elveden: Probe into corrupt payments to officials. Elveden has 70 police investigating and . has cost £5million. Operation Tuleta: Probe into computer hacking. Set up in June 2011, Tuleta has cost £1.3million and has 19 officers on its staff. Total arrests across all three: 109 . The officer, now Surrey’s deputy chief constable, will receive ‘words of advice’ – the lowest possible sanction. He is understood to be preparing to . retire next year on a pension of up to £80,000 a year, depending on the . size of any lump sum he chooses to receive. Mr Denholm was succeeded as senior . investigating officer on the murder inquiry by Maria Woodall, now a . detective superintendent. She, too, will not face any . discipline charge, but will also receive words of advice. Surrey Chief . Constable Lynne Owens said she had apologised personally to the Dowler . family for the failings of her force. She said: ‘At the time Surrey Police . became aware of phone hacking, the focus of the investigation team was . on finding Milly Dowler and then bringing her killer to justice. It was right that Milly was the . primary focus of the investigation but the matter of phone hacking . should have been revisited at a later stage.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","IPCC finds Surrey Police had known of crime in 2002 but did nothing .

"Trailblazer: Megan Knowles-Bacon, whose act combines tricks with ballet, has been voted in as secretary at the top of the elite magic organisation . Magician Megan Knowles-Bacon, whose captivating act combines tricks with ballet, has become the first woman elected to be an officer in the Magic Circle. She was voted in as secretary, one of four voluntary roles at the top of an organisation that has represented magicians for more than a century. Miss Knowles-Bacon is one of just 100 women invited into magic’s inner sanctum since it opened its doors to them 30 years ago. There are around 1,500 members in total. She is also the youngest person to ever be elected as an officer in the Magic Circle. Fellow magicians voted for her based on a pitch that was sent out in October, and she has spent the last seven months in a contest for the role with an older, male candidate. And now the 22-year-old, from Eltham, south east London, said that she wants to use her new role to encourage more women and young people to join the body. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'It has always been very male dominated and I think that has been very daunting to a degree. 'Women joining the Magic Circle is a bit like a boy doing ballet - it isn’t the norm. I would hope that we can talk to some more girls and try to get more of them involved.' She added: 'Changes are happening with the Circle now and I hope more women get roles. It feels nice to be part of history.' Miss Knowles-Bacon's appointment comes two months after Katherine Mills was announced as the first female magician to front her own television show. Ms Mills, 31, became interested in magic as a teenager but gave it up when she went to university – she studied social psychology at Loughborough. But a chance meeting with TV’s magician of the moment Dynamo was to turn her life around. And now she has her big TV break with her own show, Katherine Mills: Mind Games. She admitted it’s a strange career choice; there were no female trailblazers before her. Both women are now fighting against a stereotype: that women in serve as assistants to male magicians.

"Britain should leave the European Union unless it changes, Theresa May has warned. The Home Secretary said politicians who argue that the UK is better off in the EU 'whatever the terms, are wrong'. Ranging beyond her law and order brief – in a move likely to fuel speculation about her leadership ambitions – Mrs May also warned red tape and regulations from Brussels is holding back the UK economy. Home Secretary Theresa May has warned Britain cannot stay in the European Union at any cost . Mrs May faces a major test in the Commons tomorrow when she urges Tory MPs not to vote against plans to sign Britain up to the European Arrest Warrant. She insisted that the way it operates now is 'fairer' but it is still 'every bit as effective when it comes to protecting the public from serious crime and terrorism'. But writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs May made a wider plea for major reforms to the way the EU operates to work in the UK's interests. She said: 'While access to the world's biggest single market is in our national interest, the EU's rules and regulations hold back not just our economy, but also the economies of every other member state. That is why we need to argue for changes that make the EU more competitive, more outward-looking and more open to global trade. 'These are the reasons I believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off in the EU, whatever the terms, are wrong. But I also believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off out, whatever the terms, are also wrong. 'Because if we can make Europe work differently - if we can work towards a more flexible union of sovereign member states who use treaties and institutions to trade freely and co-operate in the fight against crime and terrorism - it will surely be in our national interest to remain members of the European Union.' David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017 . David Cameron's 'nods and winks' that he might back Britain leaving the European Union is putting the nation's future prosperity in danger, Ed Miliband claims. The Labour leader will use a speech to the CBI tomorrow to warn the UK is being left increasingly isolated and is now on a 'conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off'. He will also pledge not to play 'political games' with Britain's EU membership and insist Labour has a credible and clear plan to secure reforms. He will say: 'There are some people in our country who advocate exit from the EU. There are others who flirt with it, thinking they can do so without consequence. Both are equally dangerous. 'Giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the EU, or contemplating it, simply drags us closer to exit. 'And every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business. 'It is a betrayal of our national interest. It is a clear and present danger to our future prosperity. 'The way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them. Not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them. Not to make promises everyone knows you cannot keep.' Mrs May also issued a direct plea for MPs to back the EAW. 'If we want to stop foreign criminals from coming to Britain, deal with European fighters coming back from Syria, stop British criminals evading justice abroad, prevent foreign criminals evading justice by hiding here, and get foreign criminals out of our prisons, these measures are vital. 'Tomorrow evening, the House of Commons should vote to give the police, prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies the powers they need to keep us safe.' Tory backbencher David Davis accused Mrs May of 'scaremongering' with her claims the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) would lead to Britain becoming a 'honeypot' for fugitives. The Tory leadership face a revolt from dozens of Tory MPs,who could defy the party leadership to oppose the measure because of concerns that it is too easy for UK citizens to be extradited on relatively minor charges to countries where they may have no guarantee of a fair trial. Writing in the Sunday Times Mr Davis said: 'It is better to take a few weeks longer to return a terrorist to British justice than to take three years longer to recover a British citizen from a foreign injustice. 'The warnings that Britain will become a safe haven for criminals is an example of the sort of scaremongering that has become far too prevalent in the debates on justice and anti-terrorism measures. 'The UK was certainly no safe haven prior to the introduction of the EAW.' The controversial power is one of 35 European Union police and criminal justice measures the Government wants to opt back in to, with MPs expected to vote on the package as a whole. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Efforts to secure concessions from Brussels were undermined by a shock demand for an extra £1.7billion from Britain last month. On Friday Chancellor George Osborne boasted that he had halved the bill to £850million. But critics accused him of 'smoke and mirrors', by bringing forward a rebate payment from 2015 which was always going to be paid. Critics have claimed the reduction in the £1.7 billion bill had been achieved by bringing forward a rebate to which the UK would have been entitled anyway.","Home Secretary ranges beyond law and order brief with attack on red tape .

"A man understood to be Laila Khan's stepfather has reportedly confessed to her murder . The remains of six bodies have been recovered from the grounds of the luxury Indian farmhouse of Bollywood actress Laila Khan, police in Mumbai have said. Miss Khan, her mother Saleena Patel, and four of her siblings have been missing since February 2011. A man understood to be her stepfather has reportedly confessed to the murders of all six members of the family. According to police in Mumbai Pervaiz Ahmed Tak - who claims to be Mrs Patel's third husband - killed the family in a fit of jealousy over his wife's second husband, Asif Sheikh. Mumbai's joint commissioner of police Himanshu Roy told reporters in India on Wednesday that Tak had led officers to the human remains, which were uncovered from a six-foot deep pit at the farmhouse in Igatpuri. Mr Roy said three bodies were placed at the bottom of the pit and covered with stones and a blood-soaked mattress. A further three bodies had been placed on top of the mattress and covered with more stones. He said that while the identity of the skeletons could not yet be confirmed, it was 'reasonably likely' that they were those of Laila Khan, her mother Saleena Patel, her three sisters, and her brother. Knives and a pole were among the items recovered by officers from the farmhouse and shown to the press at a briefing on Wednesday. According to police in Mumbai Miss Khan's family had enjoyed a party at the Igatpuri farmouse on the night of February 8, 2011. After the party an argument is believed to have broken out between Tak and Laila's mother Saleena after she praised her second husband, Asif Sheikh. Mrs Patel reportedly ran to the ground floor of the farmhouse where Laila and her siblings had been sleeping. But Tak allegedly hit his wife over the head with a blunt object, killing her. A scuffle then broke out between Tak and Laila Khan, her sisters, and brother. Tak reportedly called for help from Shakir Hussain, from Kashmir, who he had appointed as a watchman at the farmhouse a few months earlier. Police said Tak decided to kill Laila and her siblings as they had witnessed him killing Mrs Patel. Tak, who hails from Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir, is then understood to have hired two drivers to take him to the Jammu region in the north of India.

"In the event of his death, the astronomer was clear about what he wanted. He would not have a funeral, but a party – ‘Quite a show. Plenty of drink.’ And yesterday, after Sir Patrick Moore died peacefully at his home, his family and friends vowed to do just that. Scroll down for video . Patrick Moore, pictured, has died aged 89. He passed away peacefully at his home in West Sussex . The monocle-wearing ‘godfather of astronomy’ passed away aged 89, at his thatched cottage in Selsey, West Sussex, after he contracted an infection. After a short stay in hospital, it was determined that no further treatment would benefit him, and he died ‘in the company of close friends and carers and his cat Ptolemy’. Sir Patrick had presented the BBC programme The Sky At Night for 55 years, making him the longest-running host of the same TV show. The final programme was broadcast just last Monday and he only missed one episode, during a nearly lethal bout of food poisoning in 2004. In recent years, he had to present the show from his home after he became wheelchair-bound. Sir Patrick Moore with one of his cats, Ptolemy, at home in Selsey, West Sussex, last year . Friends and family said he had been an ‘inspiration to generations of astronomers’ and promised a ‘farewell ceremony’ in March, to mark what would have been his 90th birthday. Sir Patrick wrote dozens of books on astronomy – and at least one on his love for cats – and his research was used by the US and the Russians in their space programmes. Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May led the tributes to his ‘dear friend’. He said: ‘Patrick is irreplaceable. There will never be another Patrick Moore. But we were lucky enough to get one.’ Dozens of celebrities paid tribute to the star on Twitter. Author Terry Pratchett wrote: ‘Sir, you’ll be sadly missed. A legend.’ Patrick Moore in 1961 on his television programme. Once he said he would like to be remembered as an amateur astronomer who played cricket and the xylophone . Sir Patrick died at home with his cat Ptolemy. The word Ptolemy is a masculine Greek name, derived from the Greek word polemeios, which means 'aggressive or warlike'. The world famous Ptolemy was a Greek geographer, mathematician, astronomer and astrologer. Although his original Greek name is Claudius Ptolemaeus, in English he is simply referred to as Ptolemy. Professor Brian Cox, a particle physicist and BBC presenter, said Sir Patrick had left ‘a wonderful legacy’, while comedian and presenter Sue Perkins said simply: ‘You taught me to look up.’ Impressionist Jon Culshaw tweeted: ‘Terribly, terribly sad to hear of the passing of Sir Patrick Moore, our godfather of astronomy, he captured its fascination for all of us.’ Hundreds of fans also expressed their sadness, with one tweeting: ‘One more star up there tonight.’ Born in Middlesex in 1923, he became interested in astronomy when he read The Story Of The Solar System at six years old and, aged 11, he became the youngest member of the British Astronomical Association. Sir Patrick Moore with the pipe he was presented with in the shape of a telescope for being Pipeman of the year, an award given to honour a famous pipe-smoking individual . He served with the RAF during the Second World War, but his fiancée Lorna, 20, a nurse, was killed in an air raid in 1943. He later said his ‘whole life ended that day’ and he never married. In 1957, he was invited to present a new BBC show, The Sky At Night – a programme which would make him a household name. Extraordinarily, he never gained any formal qualifications, but his ability to describe complex phenomena such as the black hole in an exciting and simple way endeared him to generations. He was knighted in 2001 ‘for services to the popularisation of science and to broadcasting’. Celebrating his 88th birthday last year, Sir Patrick, pictured with his typewriter, said: 'I can't use my dear old typewriter on which all my books have been written. I can't play the piano. I can't play the xylophone' Sir Patrick is pictured resting in his armchair with his black cat Ptolemy, who he died next to . Sir Patrick 'inspired every British astronomer, amateur and professional, for half a century' Tributes poured in immediately for eccentric stargazer Sir Patrick Moore as news of his death broke. Queen guitarist Brian May, who holds a PhD in astrophysics, led the chorus of praise, saying the world had 'lost a priceless treasure that can never be replaced' and he had lost a 'dear friend and kind of father figure'. May said in a statement: 'Patrick was the last of a lost generation, a true gentleman, the most generous in nature that I ever knew, and an inspiration to thousands in his personal life, and to millions through his 50 years of unique broadcasting. 'It's no exaggeration to say that Patrick, in his tireless and ebullient communication of the magic of astronomy, inspired every British astronomer, amateur and professional, for half a century. 'Patrick will be mourned by the many to whom he was a caring uncle, and by all who loved the delightful wit and clarity of his writings, or enjoyed his fearlessly eccentric persona in public life,' he added. 'Patrick is irreplaceable. There will never be another Patrick Moore. But we were lucky enough to get one.' Professor Brian Cox, who presents a number of science programmes for the BBC, tweeted: 'Very sad news about Sir Patrick. Helped inspire my love of astronomy. I will miss him!' Former BBC science correspondent and fellow astronomer Dr David Whitehouse told Sky News that Sir Patrick had 'loved astronomy more than he loved himself'. 'He was passionate, he was dedicated and had an unselfish love of astronomy and he passed that on to everybody who knew him and he came across. 'He was a difficult person personally to deal with on many occasions, he was sometimes awkward, truculent, stubborn but that was Patrick, that was part of his remarkable personality which so many people came to enjoy and love. 'I think many people realised he was a unique person. 'He was not a professionally trained astronomer and yet did professional quality work, particularly when it came to mapping the Moon in the 1950s - I think every astronomer in the world owes something to Patrick Moore.' Space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock said she had got her first inspiration to look at the night sky from Sir Patrick. She told BBC News: 'He was broadcasting before we actually went into space and he saw a change in our understanding of the universe, and he took us all the way through that, right up until today.' 'What he did was something very straightforward, he would tell us what to look for and where to look for it and for budding astronomers everywhere that is what we need, that information,' she added. 'But he would tell us more, he would go into depth, he would take us on a journey through space and we can't ask for better than that really.' Dr Marek Kukula, the Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said Sir Patrick had been a 'very charming and hospitable man'.

"A Canadian college student recently conducted a social experiment to see if people treated her differently if she wore a hijab - a traditional Muslim veil that covers a woman's head and chest - and what she discovered was a bit unexpected. Anisa Rawhani, a third-year student at Queens University in Ontario, wore the traditional Muslim garb for 18 days in January as she worked at the university's library, visited stores and restaurants near the campus and as she did volunteer work with local children. According to Rawhani - who conducted the experiment to see if people in her community were racist towards minority groups - she noticed that people actually treated her more kindly and with more respect than when she didn't wear the hijab. Experiment: Anisa Rawhani wore a hijab for 18 days to see how she was treated by other people . Rawhani, who is not Muslim, wrote about her experience wearing traditional Muslim clothing in the March edition of the Queen's Journal, where she works as a copy editor - the article is titled 'Overt to Covert.' 'At first I thought I was just imagining things. There's no way this is actually happening,' Rawhani told the Whig.com. 'I . went with my hijab and people were very nice, people were polite, . parents would shake my hand, so the experience was all across the board . in Kingston.' In some cases, she says, she would go out with friends who weren't wearing any identifying religious symbols and she was treated much nicer than they were. 'There was this excess (of niceness) that I would experience that I couldn't account for,' she said. 'Like really going the extra mile like smiling broadly and being so so polite, which I've never experienced before. It was a stark contrast that was going on that threw me for a loop.' Rawhani, who is Iranian but not Muslim, was inspired to wear the hijab by a similar social experiment conducted in the U.S. Rawhani discussed her findings with a psychology professor at her univertsity - she calls the interesting phenomenon an overcompensation. 'It can be that someone actually does harbour racist tendencies but doesn't want to look racist to others so they overcompensate in that way,' she says. She also says that it could stem from people who might think they have a bias but are trying to suppress it by being overly accommodating to people of other races or religions. 'In general, just from my interactions, I think people honestly believe in equality and have those values but they just don't know how to interact with minorities,' she says. Rawhani, who is of Iranian descent, was inspired by a similar experiment done in the United States, where women were asked to wear a hijab for a day and watch how people treated them. 'Overcompensation': Rawhani found she was treated with more respect when she wore the hijab but it might be overcompensation by people battling with feelings of bigotry . 'The desire came from wanting to understand better because there is so much tension around the idea of covering,' she says. 'I wanted to understand why women in Islam cover and also how it can actually be difficult in our culture to be covering.' 'There's so many misconceptions and people think you're oppressed and there are also issues of racism, that's what prompted it,' she continued. 'People, culture and religion arn't concepts you can understand on . your own. Rather it's through dialogue that we generate understanding . and respect between people,' Rawhani concluded.","Queens University student Anisa Rawhani wore a hijab around campus for 18 days in January .

"He has already won more than £50,000 in . compensation and legal costs from the European Court of Human Rights . over his detention in Iraq . An Iraqi terror suspect accused of plotting to blow up British soldiers could be allowed to return to this country after judges ruled he must be given his UK passport back. Alleged explosives expert Hilal Al-Jedda was given asylum in this country in 1992 but returned home during the Iraq war where he was accused of plotting atrocities against coalition forces. He was stripped of his British passport but appealed and yesterday won his case at the Supreme Court. Judges said taking his passport away was unlawful because it left him ‘stateless’ – in effect without a home country. Hard at work: Coalitions forces in Iraq were believed to be the target of Hilal Al-Jedda's plots . Al-Jedda, whose case is legally aided, has already won more than £50,000 in compensation and legal costs from the European Court of Human Rights over his three-year detention in Iraq by coalition forces. The court found his internment amounted to a breach of his right to liberty. Now ministers face the prospect of having to issue a new passport and allow the father of eight and his family back in. MPs reacted with fury to the judgment. James Clappison, a senior member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘The public will be entitled to think there is something extremely wrong with the law in a case like this – when it appears national security and public safety cannot be properly taken into account.’ Al-Jedda, 56, came to the UK in 1992 with his first wife and sought asylum. In 1998 they and their four children were given the right to remain here indefinitely and in 2000 were given British nationality. At that point, he automatically lost his Iraqi passport because the laws of that country did not allow dual nationals. After divorcing his first wife he married again in 2002 and while still married took a third wife. He lives in Turkey with his third wife and all eight of his children. In September 2004 he left Britain for Iraq and was captured by US forces in Baghdad the following month. He was then transferred to the custody of British forces in Basra and held for three years. Homeless: Al-Jedda argued it was unlawful that after seeking asylum in Britain and then having his passport was revoked he was left 'stateless' On his release from the detention facility the then Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, stripped him of his passport. Using legal aid, he launched a series of appeals to try to get it back. He won his case at the Court of Appeal last year which ‘reluctantly’ ruled in his favour. One judge said the outcome was ‘deeply unsatisfactory’ because of the threat ministers say he poses to Britain. Judges were told the reason for stripping him of his passport was the ‘atrocities’ the Islamic terrorist group he belonged to planned against coalition soldiers. He is accused of recruiting terrorists and smuggling explosives and detonators for roadside bombs. Home Secretary Theresa May appealed to the Supreme Court, which yesterday ruled he must be given his passport back. Lawyers for Mrs May argued that Al-Jedda could have applied to the Iraqi authorities to restore his nationality and that he had a right to a new Iraqi passport. The court found that British law does not allow the Secretary of State to strip someone of their passport if they do not have another – even if they could apply for one from another country. Before the 2002 Asylum Act ministers could make someone stateless if they were considered a sufficient threat to Britain, but that power was revoked. Lawyers for the Home Secretary have suggested that Al-Jedda has a real Iraqi passport and a valid grant of Iraqi nationality. This might allow her to further appeal the case. However his lawyers insist it is a fake one used to travel to Turkey in 2008. A Home Office spokesman said:  ‘We are disappointed with the court’s decision. We are considering the  judgment and our next steps in this case carefully.’","Explosives expert Hilal Al-Jedda was given asylum in 1992 but his British passport was withdrawn after returned to Iraq where he was accused of plotting atrocities against coalition forces .

"Immediately: The NFL Players Association urged the NFL in a letter on Friday to immediately reinstate Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson . The NFL Players Association urged the NFL in a letter on Friday to immediately reinstate Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, officials say. ESPN reports that the NFL should immediately reinstate Peterson as per the agreement the two sides made in September when the player was placed on the commissioner's exempt list. The agreement allegedly states that Peterson would be removed from the list when his legal matters were resolved. And on Tuesday they were, with the 29-year-old pleading no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault, down from a felony charge of child abuse for disciplining his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch. 'I'm just glad this is over,' Peterson said after the plea deal was announced in Texas. 'I can put this behind me, and me and my family can move forward.' But Peterson, who has missed the past eight games under the list's terms, may not be able to return to the field just yet. ESPN reported that the NFL said Peterson will remain on the commissioner's exempt list pending completion of the NFL's review process. This may be in violation of the initial agreement to place Peterson on the list. A few hours after the NFL released its update, the NFLPA issued a statement demanding efficiency and consistency. Scroll down for video . Agreement: Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson left the Texas courthouse with his wife Ashley Brown Peterson Tuesday after the announcement of a plea agreement  reached with prosecutors to resolve his child abuse case . Those traits have often been missing from the disciplinary process. 'Our union worked with the NFL, the Minnesota Vikings and Adrian's representatives on a mutual agreement pending the adjudication of his legal case,' the NFLPA said. 'Now that his legal matter is resolved, we believe it is Adrian's right to be treated in a manner that is consistent with similar cases under our collective bargaining agreement. 'We will pursue any and all remedies if those rights are breached.' If the NFL fails to comply with the agreement by not removing Peterson from the list, the NFLPA can then file an expedited non-injury grievance to have him reinstated immediately. There are no indications that the NFLPA will do so, but sources told ESPN that the NFL is trying to move as quickly as possible in its disciplinary review process of Peterson which is taking place now. No contest: Peterson, right, and his attorney Rusty Hardin, left, spoke to the media after pleading no contest to an assault charge Tuesday . Games: Peterson has missed a total of eight games under the terms of the commissioner's exempt list . The NFL formally began a review of the star running back's case for potential punishment under the league's personal conduct policy, informing Peterson on Thursday that his status on paid leave from the Vikings will not change until completion of the process. 'The NFL has requested that Peterson submit relevant information regarding his case and meet with designated experts who will make recommendations for the commissioner's consideration,' spokesman Brian McCarthy said. 'Peterson also will have the opportunity to have a hearing prior to the issuance of any discipline.' Peterson received what's essentially two years of probation, plus a $4,000 fine and requirement to complete parenting classes and 80 hours of community service. 'Adrian wants to get on with his life and have his relationship with his son and get back to playing football,' Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said after the plea agreement was reached to avoid a trial or any jail time for Peterson. Son: On Tuesday, the 29-year-old pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault, down from a felony charge of child abuse for disciplining his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch . Suffered: As a result of the beating, the boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles . Just how fast Peterson gets back to playing football is a complicated and potentially contentious matter. The Vikings (4-5) are in their bye week, scheduled to reconvene for practice Monday. They play next at Chicago on Nov. 16. Quiet: The Vikings have been quiet since Peterson's plea agreement, stating only that they will speak about his situation 'at the appropriate time' With only seven games left on the schedule, the timeline is tight for a return. Commissioner Roger Goodell was excoriated for his initial leniency in the caught-on-camera knockout punch Baltimore running back Ray Rice threw at his now-wife. The league boss will be under intense scrutiny for how he handles any punishment for Peterson. Weeks after handing Rice a two-game suspension, Goodell announced in August he was toughening the league's policy on domestic violence that now calls for a six-game suspension without pay for a first domestic violence offense. That's not a cut-and-dry guideline in this case with Peterson, though, because he has maintained he intended no harm in seeking to discipline his son the way he was as a child growing up in Texas. His plea was not an admission of guilt, and the felony was reduced to a misdemeanor. On the other hand, there's the firestorm to consider when the Vikings first declared on Sept. 15 that Peterson, after sitting out the home opener the day before, would remain with the team to give him his due process in the legal system. The boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records, and backlash from the public was strong. One major Vikings sponsor suspended its partnership, other corporations expressed concerns to the team and the league, and Peterson was dropped as an endorser of several brands. The Vikings then reversed course about 36 hours later, announcing that Goodell agreed to issue his special roster exemption. Peterson continued to draw his weekly in-season salary of more than $690,000, and the team was sheltered from the proverbial pitchforks that came out after their initial decision. The Vikings have been quiet since Peterson's plea agreement, stating only that they will speak about his situation 'at the appropriate time.'","The NFL Players Association urged the NFL in a letter on Friday to immediately reinstate Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson .

"A pensioner has been quite literally strumming the pounds away thanks to her unique method of dieting. Dorothy Rogan, from Darlington, has helped herself lose 4st by picking up her ukulele to stave off temptation by playing 'Oh My Darling Clementine'. The 64-year-old plays the American folk classic, which is associated with the cartoon character Huckleberry Hound, on repeat to avoid boredom and turning to snacks. Dorothy successfully utilized playing the ukulele to help her drop from 18st 7lb (left) to 14st (right) Dorothy used to use lots of butter, cream and oil in her cooking, as well as more processed foods (pictured at her heaviest) 'I must have played that song over a million times,' said Mrs Rogan. 'It is the only one I know and I just play it over and over again when I am bored. I don't ever crave food but when I am bored, I just seemed to eat. Playing the ukulele has really defeated the boredom but it has driven my husband to despair. 'I even continue playing it when it out of tune and it sounds absolutely dreadful. John will just come in and look at me and shake his head. We all call him 'Poor John' now' Mrs Rogan, who decided to lose weight after undergoing a quadruple heart bypass last year, has managed to drop from 18st 7lb to under 14st and intends to keep losing the pounds. As well as losing the weight, Dorothy says she now has so much more energy (left, before her weight loss, right, now) In an effort to relieve her husband's suffering she is now practising 'He's Got the Whole World in his Hands' and a festive favourite for the Christmas period in 'Jingle Bells'. Dorothy combined her ukulele playing with going to Slimming World in order to lose the pounds. She is now attempting to learn two new songs to alleviate husband John's despair . Mrs Rogan said: 'I went to Slimming World and it's been excellent for me. It showed me how to eat properly and showed me an easy way to live my life. Mrs Rogan's is now enjoying the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, having dropped three dress sizes. She credits her ukulele playing with her weight loss sucess, as well as making small changes such as swapping double cream for natural yoghurt and using spray-oil instead of olive oil. 'I used to use lots of oil and cream and butter in my cooking, now I've changed how I cook totally. I don't add any sugar to anything either. It's basically a low fat, healthy diet. 'As well as losing weight, I have dropped three dress sizes and have a lot more energy these days. I even make my meals from scratch, even the sauces and they are all even tastier than before.' Mrs Rogan learned the ukulele at classes run by Age UK Darlington, who she also volunteers for. She added: 'Age UK is a fantastic organisation who do great work with older people. You have never seen so many 80 to 90-year-old's using computers, on the internet and even playing the ukulele like me. 'Life does not stop in your 50s and 60s. That is why it is great to have such activities put on for people to learn. 'I was never musical and could never imagined playing an instrument, especially at the age of 64. I am really glad that I did.'","Took up instrument when she realised she ate when she was bored .

"Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has paid tribute to Wayne Goss, describing him as a great Labor man who dragged Queensland out of a decades-long malaise. The former Queensland premier has died at the age of 63 after a long fight against brain cancer. Mr Shorten said the Goss government modernised Queensland, acting against the police corruption that marked the Bjelke-Petersen years, decriminalising homosexuality and creating new national parks. He was a proud Queenslander and 'great Labor man'. Scroll down for video . Wayne Goss has died at the age of 63 . 'His victory in the 1989 state election marked a new era - an end to the malaise and corruption that had eaten away at Queensland's democracy in the final stretch of 32 years of conservative rule,' Mr Shorten said in a statement. Former federal treasurer Wayne Swan - who was Queensland Labor Party state secretary during the Goss years - said he had lost a close friend and Queenslanders had lost one of their finest leaders. Mr Goss was a leader of integrity and discipline, he said. 'Wayne changed Queensland - the state we love - for the better, and he dragged it into the sunlight after 32 years in the darkness.' Goss served as Queensland's premier from 1989 to 1996 . When he was elected he ended the National Party's 32-year grip on power in the state . Peter Beattie, who replaced Mr Goss as Labor leader in 1997, said Queensland had lost a man who returned honesty to the state. 'He was one of those people who made a difference. He was the Mr Clean of Queensland politics,' he told the ABC from New York. 'You can imagine what would have happened to Queensland if Wayne Goss had not run for state parliament. 'The Fitzgerald (corruption) inquiry would have been in vain and Queensland would have slipped back to the bad old days.' Goss, pictured here with former Labor premier Peter Beattie, had undergone surgery for brain tumours in recent years . A plan to run at the federal election in 1998 against Pauline Hanson was scuppered by a brain tumour . Keith de Lacy, who served as treasurer under Mr Goss, said he'd lost a very good friend. 'He had a wonderful sense of humour. It didn't come across all the time to the public and some people thought him a little aloof but that was very misleading,' he said. Mr Goss was in charge of implementing the recommendations flowing from Queensland's landmark corruption inquiry headed by Tony Fitzgerald. Mr Fitzgerald said he greatly admired Mr Goss, and said he was a man of uncompromising integrity. 'After he became premier, Wayne's leadership produced the reforms which transformed the state,' he said in a statement to AAP. 'Like most political reformers, he paid a heavy price. 'We've had little contact over recent years, but happily we shared a simple meal with our wives a couple of months ago when he was already gravely ill.'","Goss had undergone surgery for brain tumours in recent years .

"Bolton are prepared to take a gamble on Nick Powell that they hope will pay off with a return to the Barclays Premier League. The 20-year-old Manchester United forward will have his loan spell at Leicester City cut short having made just three substitute appearances and the Foxes losing each game. Powell has long been hailed as one of England’s great hopes but his attitude has been brought into question over recent seasons by coaches at United, Wigan and now Leicester. Nick Powell has struggled to make an impact at Leicester after joining on loan from Manchester United . The 20-year-old has played just three times since joining in the summer, and his loan will be terminated . Bolton manager Neil Lennon is up for the challenge of turning round one of the country’s most talented prospects but he will be wondering which Powell will turn up. A star made in Crewe with the world at his feet, he announced his arrival with a thunderbolt goal in the 2-0 victory over Cheltenham Town in the 2012 League Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium. It secured Crewe’s promotion to League One and helped convince Sir Alex Ferguson to sign him for United in a deal worth £6m. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce bemoaned how United’s financial muscle had blown them out of the water. Powell scored on his United debut against Wigan and seemed tuned in to the task ahead. ‘It was great to make my debut,’ he said after that game. ‘To then cap it off with a goal is what I’ve been working for. Powell scored on his Manchester United debut against Wigan, but has not pushed on as hoped since .

'Dario (Gradi, Crewe’s director of football) used to say my game isn’t just attacking and defending, it’s about goals as well and I proved that last season and hopefully I can do that for United. 'My dad will keep me in touch, I’ll tell you that. I’m just going to go home, have this great feeling and I’ll keep myself on the ground. When I first came on it scared me a little bit, to be fair, because I’m only used to 5,000 people now and then, but it’s a great atmosphere – the fans are great. 'It wasn’t the hardest game because they made it easier for me but I’m happy to be on the pitch getting minutes. 'I learn every day, especially from the midfielders – Scholes, Carrick, Giggsy – they’re all great, they’ve all been through it and won trophies. That’s what I want to do, so I hope to learn off them every day.’ Powell is sometimes criticised for his laid-back attitude, to the point at which some have called him idle . The midfielder still has plenty of talent, and has played at the highest level, including the Champions League . He remained, understandably for his tender years, a peripheral figure and was loaned out to Wigan the following season. A 12-goal haul showed his loan was a success but it was not without the input of coach Owen Coyle. His successor Uwe Rosler struggled to draw the same impact. ‘He’s got the talent but he just looks as if he’s not interested,’ said one coach. ‘He constantly needs pushing and you tell him some things and it seems to go over his head. It’s as if football is his hobby not his profession.’ United staff talk of needing to supervise him in the gym and a laidback style that borders on idleness. ‘Hopefully this will make him realise what he needs to do,’ said the coach. ‘But you get the feeling he’d be happy going back to Crewe.’","Nick Powell has played just three times for Leicester this season .

"Crystal Palace have got their mojo back. A club that has been on an upward trajectory for the past four-and-half years was seeing all that hard work beginning to disintegrate with the acrimonious departure of Tony Pulis and the unimaginative appointment of Neil Warnock. Palace know they will never be able to compete with the biggest sides in the land, but the Eagles thrive on being the cool kid in the Premier League playground. Neil Warnock rues a missed opportunity against Burnley as Crystal Palace fans watch on . Impressing neutrals with their guts, passion and eccentricities is in this club's fibre, and those attributes have all been sadly lacking since August, having been so proudly prominent last season. But now, with the impending appointment of Alan Pardew, Palace are back in the limelight. Make no mistake, there's plenty for Pardew to do if Palace are to stay up, but the news of his impending appointment alone has already breathed oxygen in to an atmosphere that was becoming toxic. Pardew is no Pep Guardiola, he's no Pulis either, but Eagles fans know he's one of them - and his managerial record isn't bad. LMA manager of the year in 2012 with Newcastle, Palace supporters could not have hoped for any better given the situation they currently find themselves in. Crystal Palace players react after conceding against Manchester City earlier this month . Alan Pardew is set to leave Newcastle United to take over as Crystal Palace manager . Pardew's appointment will restore fans' faith in Steve Parish and the club's board, too. While CPFC 2010 - who saved Palace from liquidation that year - will always be universally popular among the Selhurst Park faithful, their decision-making regarding the departure of Pulis and the appointment of Warnock has come in for serious criticism in some quarters. With the transfer window opening this week, Pardew's presence should be enough in itself to attract the players capable of keeping Palace in the top flight. At any rate, major surgery is not required. This, after all, is a squad that finished 11th last season and was significantly improved upon in the summer - hence the frustration with how things were going under Warnock. Warnock was doing nothing for Palace's street-cred, which hit its highest point in the early 1990s when Pardew was a player. Pardew's winner against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final is well documented but their performance that year was not a flash in the pan. The following season, with him in midfield, Palace finished third in the old First Division. Pardew celebrates his winner against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park . No one is expecting Palace to be able to do that again any time soon but with one of their own in charge - a man who just so happens to be one of the most experienced and proven Premier League managers around - pride can start coursing through those red and blue veins again. The silence at what proved to be Warnock's final game against Southampton on Boxing Day was deafening. However this reunion between club and cult hero goes, the decibel level will be off the scale when Tottenham visit on January 10 for Pardew's return to Selhurst Park.","Alan Pardew set to leave Newcastle United to take over at Crystal Palace .

"West Bromwich Albion chairman Jeremy Peace is considering his options on head coach Alan Irvine, but the club is not expected to make an announcement on Monday. Irvine came in for fierce criticism from Albion fans at the end of the 2-0 loss to Stoke City and could pay with his job following a run of seven defeats in nine matches. The Scot is still scheduled to face the media on Tuesday afternoon, however, in a press conference ahead of the New Year’s Day clash with West Ham. Alan Irvine is facing increasing speculation that his job is under threat as manager of West Brom . Joleon Lescott (centre) says that Irvine has always had the backing of the West Brom players . Defender Lescott looks dejected after West Brom concededed the second goal to Stoke on Sunday . Peace has acted decisively in the past when results have been in decline and is understood to be concerned at the club’s slide down the table to one point above the relegation places. There has been a desire, though, to make what was a bold decision last summer work if possible. Irvine, while under huge pressure, still retains support from players for his training methods and works fastidiously within West Brom’s structure as head coach. But a vocal number of supporters have never been in favour of an individual who was sacked from Preston North End and Sheffield Wednesday in his two previous managerial roles – and that could ultimately tip the balance. Travelling fans chanted ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and ‘Sacked in the morning’ at Irvine during the defeat at the Britannia. Peace will mull over whether there is a candidate available who would meet the club’s standards. Tim Sherwood, who came close to the job last summer, is likely to emerge once again. Irvine's team have been on a bad run and they were beaten 2-0 by Stoke in the Premier League on Sunday . West Brom are not in talks with Liverpool about selling in-form striker Saido Berahino . Irvine retains the support of his players and defender Joleon Lescott insisted he has their full backing despite their desperate run. 'Yes, of course, and that has never, ever been in question,' said Lescott, who worked with Irvine at Everton. 'It's wrong that he is under pressure because it is the players out there who have put in performances like that and are not getting results. 'They (the West Brom fans) are entitled to their opinion. Some of it is harsh, but they paid their money and travelled up to Stoke, so they are entitled to their opinion.

"Mike Rigg has quit the Football Association after one year to take up a new role as Fulham's Chief Football Officer. Rigg left his role as the FA's head of talent identification to accept the job at Craven Cottage as chairman Shahid Khan continues to overhaul personnel at the club and build a structure to support new manager Kit Symons. Khan said: 'Based on my experience over the past 17 months and through the most recent managerial search, it became clear to me that the new Fulham manager - in fact, the entire football operation - would benefit from someone whose sole responsibility was to focus on the short, mid and long-term product on the pitch. Mike Rigg has quit his role as the FA's head of talent identification to join Fulham . Rigg, who formerly worked as technical director at Manchester City and QPR, was only at the FA for one year . 'In my mind, that called for a head of all football activities that would report directly to me but work collaboratively with Kit, our scouting group, the Academy, sports performance medical and our analytics team. 'This wasn't a revelation, but rather the recognition that the challenges football clubs face today are more complex than ever and our ambition requires that we organise in the optimal way to achieve our goals. 'But we were not interested in accelerating this organisational shift for Fulham until, or unless, we found the right person. And we have in Mike Rigg.' Khan stressed the position of Huw Jennings as academy director will remain unchanged and crucial to the future. 'Player development will be at the core of our foundation at Fulham,' said the chairman. Fulham owner Shahid Khan said the club would benefit from someone whose sole responsibility was to focus on the short, mid and long-term product on the pitch . Chief executive Alistair Mackintosh will be asked to focus more on commercial matters and projects like the development of the Riverside Stand at Craven Cottage and the expansion of the training ground. It is less than a month since Dan Ashworth, the FA's director of elite development, launched his document detailing the DNA of English football and hailed Rigg's role in the project. 'We are really sorry to see Mike go but we totally understand his reasons,' said Ashworth, in a statement released by the FA. 'It was always likely he would move back into club football at some stage, as this type of role becomes increasingly common within the game. 'Mike has played a huge part in the transformation of the way in which we work in talent identification and helped build and shape a department that looks after both the male and female game. Newly appointed Rigg will work in collaboration with new manager Kit Symons . 'I would like to place on record my thanks for all of his hard work and support and wish him well in his new role at Fulham.' The return is quicker than anticipated for Rigg, who worked in various technical development and scouting roles for Sheffield Wednesday, Blackburn, Manchester City and QPR before joining the FA in 2013. Rigg told the FA's website: 'Over the last 12 months I have been fortunate to work with some of the most inspirational and talented people in football that I have experienced over the last 25 years. 'I believe and know that The FA – under Dan and Gareth Southgate's leadership – is on the right path with its plans and philosophy. 'I genuinely wish them and all of my friends at St. George's Park and Wembley the best of luck going forward.

"From holodecks and virtual surgeons to 3d printed smart clothes and virtual sex, it seems the future is about to get a lot more hi-tech. Researchers were asked to imagine the technology they believe will be around in 2025, when ultra high speed 'gigabit' internet connections are commonplace. The agree that virtual reality will be key, and say the age of the Star Trek 'holodeck' could finally arrive. Scroll down for video . 'Wearing clothes that are tailor-made for you every day, 3D-printed at home, will also become normal, with the previous day's clothes recycled efficiently, one expert claims. The age of gigabit connectivity is dawning and will advance in coming years. A gigabit connection can deliver 1,000 megabits of information per second (Mbps). Globally, cloud service provider Akamai reports that the average global connection speed in quarter one of 2014 was 3.9 Mbps, with South Korea reporting the highest average connection speed, 23.6 Mbps and the US at 10.5 Mbps. The new report from the Pew Research Center and Elon University called Killer Apps in the Gigabit Age, asked 1,464 experts what the advent of gigabit-speed internet connections will mean. They all agree that virtual environments were likely to become key. 'There will be full, always-on, 360-degree environmental awareness, a semantic overlay on the real world, and full-presence massive open online courses. 'Plus Skype won't break up nearly as much,' said David Weinberger, Berkman Center for Internet & Society. However, they believe that pornography will be among the prime uses of the technology as holodecks appear at home. 'On the entertainment front, something like the Holodeck concept first shown in the old Star Trek series is actually within our grasp by 2025,' said Kathryn Campbell, an analyst with Primitive Spark. 'Games, films, shopping for cars and vacations, and (of course) porn will all become immersive 3D experiences.' However, rather than the current vitual worlds, experts say that holograms could finally become a reality. 'No doubt the killer app will be real-life holograms operating in real time: for instance, as doctors, as surgeons, as coworkers,' Futurist Marcel Bullinga said. He believes it could mean the end of having to go to the office. 'Sensors everywhere—on property, on our clothes, on (and perhaps in) our bodies, all of it feeding digital information to be processed on servers or filtered and passed to the cloud. 'By 2025 small devices might be powered by harvested energy, in which case the possibilities expand dramatically. 'On the receiving end of this massive information flow will be large displays at work and in many homes through which vast quantities of information can be rapidly visualized. 'We have lagged in exploiting this because it is more difficult to model or demo than a simple application, but it will come.' Jonathan Grudin, Microsoft Research . 'It will change the workplace. Not only will it diminish the need for business travel, it will also increase competition in the labor market immensely. 'Whereas before you had to compete with fellow humans in the same physical area, immigrants for example, in the future you have to compete with 'cloud immigrants'—coworkers appearing in their work as a hologram.' Singer Paloma Faith being filmed to be made into a hologram: Researchers believe that by 2025, holograms will be commonplace, and allow us to work and even recieve healthcare at home. Schoolchildren are also likely to spend far less time in the classroom, it was predicted. 'The school day will disaggregate into a number of learning sessions, some at home, some in the neighborhood, some in pairs, some in larger groups, with different kinds of facilitators.' JP Rangaswami of Salesforce.com said. He also believes that advances in technology will lead to a massive change in how we shop - with a new outfit being printed every day, and recycled once it has been worn. 'Wearing clothes that are tailor-made for you every day, 3D-printed at home, will also become normal, with the previous day's clothes recycled efficiently' said Rangaswami . 'Entertainment appliances, environmental control systems, and security alarm systems will all benefit from third-party service providers managing these systems on our behalf. 'Smart cities will amass substantial information in real time to deal with traffic, power generation, and distribution. 'High-speed connectivity means streaming will be replaced by download/playback except for real-time events. Group interaction and perhaps 3D video will become a reality. 'Already we see a lot of the former in Google’s Hangouts. '3D printing will lead to completely new supply chains including for raw materials. 'Designs will be transferred on the Net and devices created at the end points with 3D printing and manual or automatic assembly.” Vint Cerf, vice president and chief Internet evangelist for Google . The report also says that our diets will change dramatically, as will the way we monitor our health. 'The next big food fad, after hipster locavores, will be individualized scientific diets, based on the theory that each person's unique genetics, locations, and activities mean that she requires a specific diet, specially formulated each day.'Judith Donath, Berkman Center for Internet and Society claimed. Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, says that our health will also improve thanks to more monitoring. Experts all agree that virtual environments were likely to become key in the future . 'The big story here is continuous health monitoring... It will be much cheaper and more convenient to have that monitoring take place outside the hospital. 'You will be able to purchase health-monitoring systems just like you purchase home-security systems. 'Indeed, the home-security system will include health monitoring as a matter of course. Robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace.'","Dozens of experts were asked to predict how high speed connections will be used in 2025 .

"Being overweight can cost you dearly - both in terms of health and finances. Researchers studying 150,000 Swedish men that were obese aged 18 found they grew up to earn 16% less than their peers of a normal weight. Even people who were overweight at 18, that is, with a body-mass index from 25 to 30, saw significantly lower wages as an adult. A bulging waistline does not lead to a bulging wallet: Researchers found in a study of 150,000 Swedish men that were obese aged 18 grow up to earn 16% less than their peers of a normal weight. The world has seen a remarkable increase in childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity, the researchers say. In the United States, childhood obesity has tripled since the late 1970s. In Sweden, where the study was carried out, there has been a fourfold increase between 1984 and 2000. It is estimated that worldwide, 150 to 160 million school-aged children were overweight in 2004; of these, about one-quarter were obese. Researchers looked at Swedish men who enlisted in compulsory military service in the 1980s and 1990s. Obese 18-year-old men will earn 16 percent less over their a lifetime than those of a normal weight, according to the study published in the research journal Demography. This is roughly the same lifetime earnings penalty as missing about three years of college education, the researchers point out. 'Our empirical analysis provides four important results,' the team say. 'First, we provide the first evidence of a large adult male labor market penalty for being overweight or obese as a teenager. 'Second, we replicate this result using data from the United States and the United Kingdom. 'Third, we note a strikingly strong within-family relationship between body size and cognitive skills/noncognitive skills. 'Fourth, a large part of the estimated body-size penalty reflects lower skill acquisition among overweight and obese teenagers. 'Taken together, these results reinforce the importance of policy combating early-life obesity in order to reduce healthcare expenditures as well as poverty and inequalities later in life. The team analyzed health and wage statistics for 150,000 Swedish men who enlisted in mandatory military service at age 18 in the 1980s and 1990s. Since obesity can be affected by factors like household income, the researchers controlled for family characteristics by only using men who had a brother also included in the study. This allowed researchers to compare heavier and thinner brothers who had the same family backgrounds, controlling for things like wealth, geography or ethnicity. Even when brothers were compared, the researchers found that obesity correlated with lower earnings. Researchers found that the heavier a person was, the more their earnings dropped. They hypothesized that the gap was due to obese teens not fully developing so-called 'non-cognitive' skills, like confidence and self-motivation. The 'bullying, lower self-esteem, and discrimination by peers and teachers' that these obese male teens experienced had a ripple effect through their future financial lives, according to the study. The researchers pointed out that this is not exclusively a Swedish problem, as they found 'strikingly similar results using U.S. and UK data.' The study said that it is critical for countries to introduce policies and programs to combat childhood obesity, 'in order to reduce healthcare expenditures as well as poverty and inequalities later in life.' 'In sum, our results suggest that the rapid increase in childhood and adolescent obesity could have long-lasting effects on the economic growth and productivity of nations. The team analyzed health and wage statistics for 150,000 Swedish men who enlisted in mandatory military service at age 18 in the 1980s and 1990s. 'We believe that the rationale for government intervention for these age groups is strong because children and adolescents are arguably less able to take future consequences of their actions into account. 'Moreover, their choice of goods and physical activities is largely determined by the knowledge and preferences of parents, as well as by food supply and activities at school. 'Policies aimed at addressing the market failure associated with childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity hold great promise, and more research on cost-effective measures is warranted.'","Study of 150,000 male Swedish siblings .

Emotional embrace: Matthew Miller, 24, beamed as his mother rushed over to the plane to hug him . Family: Terri Chung, sister of Kenneth Bae, answered questions from the media after attending Sunday service at Quest Church in Interbay, Washington state . According to Business Insider, Chung said on Sunday that her brother said 'That’s all I’ve been eating for the last two years. He said, ""I want a burger or pizza or something."" So we saw that Papa John’s was open around the corner.' Chung also said that her brother was staying with family members, and enjoyed visiting with his loved ones upon his return. 'He was cut off from all of that for two years,' she said. 'His only contacts were his guard, and maybe doctors and a handful of times the Swedish embassy.' Chung said she was thrilled to have her brother home, and that 'he bears no ill will' over his ordeal. Although he still has warm feelings for the North Korean people, Chung doubted her brother would want to return to that country any time soon. He hasn't told them many details about his ordeal and Chung said she remains worried about her brother. The State Department called the family at about 2 a.m. Saturday to give them the news that Bae was coming home. They also received a call a few days earlier saying something might be happening, but Chung was reluctant to believe that message. 'There's been a lot of heartbreak and disappointment,' she said of the years of waiting for her brother's release. She thanked people around the world for their prayers and government officials and others for advocating for Bae's release. She also said former detainees and their families have been a source of comfort and support for her family. 'First and foremost we thank God,' Chung said, adding soon afterward, 'I have to thank President Obama.' Bae, who was jailed in 2012 for alleged anti-government activities, was the first to step off the plane emblazoned with stars and stripes and onto the tarmac Saturday night into the arms of his family members. The Korean-American missionary from Lynnwood, Washington, laughed and beamed as he hugged his mother who ran over to him. He was followed by California-born Miller, 24, who was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum. With a shaved head, Miller looked happy but subdued as he walked down the steps and into his beaming mother's arms. His father wrapped an arm over his shoulder and took one of Miller's two small bags to carry. North Korea said Miller had wanted to experience prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation.

He started his speech by saying: 'I just want to say thank you all for supporting me and standing by me in this time and it's been just [an] amazing blessing to see so many people being involved getting me released in the last two years - not to mention the thousands of people praying for me. 'I just want to thank you for lifting me up and not forgetting me, not forgetting the people of North Korea as well.' 'This has been a tremendously difficult time for my family. 'I just want to thank President Obama and the state departments working tirelessly to bring me home, and North Korea. 'It's been an amazing two years. I learned a lot, I grew a lot lost, a lot of weight - in a good way - and I'm standing strong.'

"They are hated by many as an eyesore on the countryside. But conventional wind farms may one day become a thing of the past after scientists trialled turbines which can be flown in the sky like kites. The turbines, which are being developed by Google, would be tethered 300 metres above ground and would have wings to help them stay air bound. Scroll down for video . The turbines, which are being developed by Google, would be tethered 300 metres above ground . Floating at high altitudes, they would be powered by higher wind speeds and therefore could increase the amount of energy produced. Peter Fitzgerald, Google’s UK sales director, said the turbines could also save on construction costs. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, he said the turbines could spell a solution to the world’s energy problems. He said: ‘It can make a big difference when it comes to energy. ‘It is tethered, has wings and if you go to high altitude flying around bringing energy. Peter Fitzgerald, Google’s UK sales director, said turbines could spell a solution to the world’s energy problems . Floating at high altitudes, they would be powered by higher wind speeds and therefore could increase the amount of energy produced . ‘You have to spend a lot of money on steel and concrete to build these massive turbines and you can only do that in about 15 per cent of the world where the wind is fast enough.’ With the tethered turbines, he added, you could use them on ‘double the amount of land’. He admitted: ‘It’s kind of out there.’ The turbines are being developed as part of the company’s Google X department. It acquired Makani, the company originally trialling the technology, last year. Engineers say the ‘energy kite’ has the potential to generate 50 per cent more energy while eliminating 90 per cent of the materials used and for half the cost of conventional wind turbine. Google X is also working on a number of other pioneering gadgets, including a contact lenses for people with diabetes which can measure the wearer’s glucose levels. Mr Fitzgerald also spoke about Google’s Project Loon, in which it aims to deliver broadband to very rural areas. The concept involves flying balloons equipped with its internet technology at high altitude. He said the balloons would use ‘algorithms to try to figure out how to ride wind currents.’ He added: ‘There are so many parts of the world where if you put broadband in it is so expensive and it will take it forever. ‘But if you use balloons it is low cost and you can get hundreds of millions of people on the internet.’","Google is developing  machines which will be tethered 300 metres in the air .

"Russian police are investigating the mysterious death of a man shot dead by a lethal 007-style gun disguised as a pen (stock) Russian police are investigating the mysterious death of a man shot dead by a lethal 007-style gun disguised as a pen. Alexei Tolmachev, 35, from Tambov, was found slumped on the floor at his friend's office in Moscow, killed by a shot to his right temple. Beside him was the pen - in fact a deadly weapon. 'On the floor was found a man, all in blood,' said a police report. 'His head was destroyed by the bullet.' Initial reports suggest the man - alone in the offices of a housing services company - shot himself, though it was unclear if the weapon, the kind that the KGB might have used in the Cold War, was his own or something he found by chance. His friend, Igor Trofimov, said he had allowed unemployed TV cameraman Tolmachev into his office during a night shift so he could use his computer to search for work. 'We spent together a few hours together  chatting and surfing the Internet,' said the friend. 'Alexei didn't complain about anything, he behaved normally. At 2am I told him I was tired and went to have some rest. 'He said that he would stay a bit longer by the computer, he wanted to check his social network page.' The pen found next to Tolmachev has been likened to that used by James Bond in the film Goldeneye . The man gave no clue that he was distressed or liable to kill himself, said Trofimov. A police statement said: 'According to preliminary data from the investigation, the man shot himself in the head from an improvised firing device - made from a pen. 'The circumstances and cause of the incident are to be established.'","Alexei Tolmachev, 35, found slumped on floor at his friend's Moscow office .

"Victoria Milligan, pictured with her surviving children . A woman whose husband and daughter were killed in a speedboat tragedy told how she heard one of her children screaming: ‘Daddy’s dead, Daddy’s dead.’ Victoria Milligan, her husband Nick and their four children were thrown into the water when the couple lost control of their boat, which then raced round in circles and inflicted terrible injuries on the family. Mr Milligan and the couple’s eight-year-old daughter Emily were killed. Mrs Milligan lost a leg and their son Kit was also hit by the boat’s propeller and needed 12 operations to save his leg. Describing how an idyllic family holiday in Padstow, Cornwall turned to horror, Mrs Milligan, 40, said: ‘I have never felt more helpless. My family was in extreme danger. There was nothing I could do. ‘I grabbed my four-year-old son, Kit, who was near me. He was screaming, “No more cold water, Mummy, no more cold water!” ‘I hadn’t factored in how hard it is to swim in a life jacket, so we didn’t move very far, but just far enough to save both our lives. When the boat came around a second time, we were just outside the circle, and I felt the hull hit my chest – but what I didn’t feel was the propeller cutting my leg.’ Mrs Milligan said a watersports instructor and three canoeists risked their own lives to stop the speedboat and rescue the family, but she then heard her eldest daughter cry out that her father had been killed. Writing in the Sunday Times, she said: ‘I remember my 12-year-old, Amber, in the water screaming, “Daddy’s dead, Daddy’s dead”, her face covered in blood from her injured hand. I remember the most basic of all human instincts, survival, kicking in. Victoria Milligan has spoken of the horrifying moment she learned her husband Nick and daughter Emily (left) had been killed when they, along with children Amber (top), Olivia (right) and Kit (centre) were thrown from a speedboat during a family holiday in Cornwall . ‘Lying in the water, dipping into unconsciousness having lost a lot of blood, I was figuring out how I was going to look after the children on my own; I’d put the house on the market, buy a smaller one. It still surprises me how strong that practical survival instinct is.’ The family from Wandsworth, South London, had travelled to Cornwall in May 2013 for a bank holiday weekend in their holiday home near St Enodoc, and took their speedboat out into the Camel estuary for a day trip. Mrs Milligan said her husband, 51, a senior executive at Sky Media, had disconnected the boat’s ‘kill cord’ – a safety device that stops the power if the driver is thrown – while he retrieved his sunglasses from the back of the boat. Writing of the tragic accident, Mrs Milligan said she had everything she ever wanted before losing her 'lovely husband' and beloved daughter . Mr Milligan and his daughter Emily (left) were injured in the water by the boats propellers. The 51-year-old was a managing director at Sky . When he then put the boat in a steep turn – possibly as the result of slipping while helping his wife to steer – the family were thrown overboard without being able to stop the engine. By the time the boat had been stopped, all six members of the family had been struck by the boat or its propeller. Mrs Milligan said she only learned Emily had been killed after she had been taken to hospital. Mrs Milligan’s left leg was so badly injured that doctors amputated it below the knee, but they were able to save Kit’s leg after 12 operations. Amber and her other daughter, Olivia, then aged ten, suffered relatively minor injuries. Speaking of her life before the tragedy, she wrote of having everything she ever wanted: 'a  husband I adored, four beautiful children, a gorgeous house in London and a holiday home in Cornwall'. Mrs Milligan quietly raised £250,000 for Cornwall Air Ambulance following the deaths of her husband and daughter. She is pictured delivering a cheque to the charity . A still from footage taken on the day of the accident shows the out-of-control boat on the Camel Estuary . Previously, she described the pain of losing her loved ones. 'My whole life was completely planned and sorted with my lovely husband and my four children, and the rug has been pulled from underneath me. 'I only had my little girl for eight years. 'Anniversaries, birthdays, Father’s Day, the anniversary of the accident, everything – you just look at a black hole and you don’t want to contemplate it because it is just too awful to think about.’ In the aftermath of the accident, Mrs Milligan was so overwhelmed by grief that she wished she had been killed. ‘Long-term plans for our future have very suddenly been taken away and I must make new ones,’ she wrote. Mrs Milligan and three of the children were airlifted to hospital as rescuers scrambled in the water to get their speed boat under control . ‘After the accident I thought Nicko was the lucky one, as he didn’t have to feel any of the indescribable pain I was feeling. I hate to admit it, but I wished it had been me that had been killed. Now I know I am the lucky one as I get to see our children grow up.’ Mrs Milligan, a personal trainer, now walks with a prosthetic leg. She said caring for her surviving children had helped her to cope with her grief. She has helped to raise £750,000 for Child Bereavement UK, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the Cornwall Air Ambulance and is writing a book about the tragedy and its aftermath to help other families to cope with bereavement. An inquest into the deaths opens in Truro today. An inquest into their deaths is to take place at Truro Coroner’s Court tomorrow.

Assurances of fast-tracking the youngster into the U21 set-up - and then possibly the senior squad within the next 12 months or as early as the end of the season - could help persuade Agyei to stay at the League Two side.

"Millions had already come to marvel at the spectacle of the Tower of London poppies. And yesterday tens of thousands more were drawn to the memorial as the capital fell silent in remembrance. As bells rang out at 11am, the vast crowd stood hushed before the hundreds of thousands of ceramic poppies – one for every British and colonial death during the Great War. A ripple of applause marked the end of the two-minute silence, and five friends paid a very personal tribute to their own war dead. Scroll down for video . The Tower surrounded: In a spectacular aerial image, the sea of red poppies encircles the Tower of London yesterday. Serving soldiers Tony Davies and Brian Smith joined retired colleagues Matt Pope, Ross Harrison and Bradley White to uncork a bottle of vintage port in a toast to nine comrades killed in Afghanistan in 2007, and hailed them as heroes. Mr White, 28, who served as a private in the 1st Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment, said the Tower of London commemoration recalled the ‘scale of the sacrifice’ of an earlier generation of soldiers. He served in both Iraq and Afghanistan until 2007, when he was shot in the left leg during a Taliban ambush, destroying his calf muscle. Support: Veterans praised the public for showing their backing of the military and the losses endured in the name of war . He said: ‘It is the first time I have come to London for Remembrance Day, so it is poignant to remember all those who died serving their country. ‘I saw the poppies a few weeks ago. Seeing it all finished now just shows the scale of the sacrifice. It is quite emotional when you look at the sheer scale of it. ‘When we were out in Afghanistan we lost nine soldiers, and numerous more since. So it does bring back poignant memories from when we were out there.’ The 1st Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment endured a particularly bloody deployment to Helmand in 2007, which was described as some of the toughest fighting the British Army had faced in a generation. Ceramic poppies at the Tower of London, which have been sold to members of the public for £25. Buyers are being warned not to put them outside until spring because they may crack in extremely cold weather . The installation of over 888,000 red ceramic poppies was created by artist Paul Cummins, each poppy representing a British or colonial fatality during World War One . Also planting poppies were Chelsea Pensioner Albert Willis, 79, an ex Grenadier Guard alongside a Tower of London Yeoman Warder and a serving Grenadier Guard . Mr Harrison, who served in the same battalion, said: ‘This is for nine heroes, Chris Gray, Darren Bonner, George Davey, Captain David Hicks MC, Robert Foster, John Thrumble, Aaron McClure, Tony Rawson and Alex Hawkins.’ The poppy installation at the Tower is due to be completed tomorrow on Armistice Day as the final ceramic flowers are planted in the moat, bringing the total to 888,246. The artwork – the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red – has proved so popular, with an estimated four million visitors, that there have been calls to keep the poppies at the Tower until the end of the year. Volunteers will start dismantling the artwork on Wednesday, but a section, the wave of poppies, will remain in place until the end of the month. Floodlights have been installed to allow more people to visit after dusk after overwhelming crowds closed the nearby tube station . The Weeping Window, a section of the piece with flowers pouring out of one of the tower's historic windows, will remain until December . The poignant tribute is among many pieces of artwork produced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI . This part and the so-called weeping window will also be installed at sites across the UK until 2018 and will eventually go on permanent display at the Imperial War Museum. In a sign of solidarity, a former German paratrooper laid a wreath of remembrance at a village church yesterday. Adam Druschel, 95, saw action across Europe while serving with the crack 1st Parachute Regiment in the Second World War. The one-time unteroffizier was eventually captured by the Americans at Mons, Belgium, in September 1944, and ended up as a prisoner of war in Britain. He joined his English-born wife, Constance, 84, at St John the Evangelist Church in Lund, near Preston, Lancashire, to honour the fallen of both world wars. ‘It is sad to think that World War One began a century ago,’ he said. ‘I wanted to be here to remember all those who died, of all nationalities.’ The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the artwork in October. Volunteers have been adding to the piece since it was unveiled in August . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge toured the sea of poppies in August with Prince William in one of the first official visits to the site .","As bells rang out at 11am yesterday, the vast crowd stood hushed before the sea of ceramic poppies .

"China signed a landmark deal today to buy Russian natural gas worth about $400 billion, giving a boost to diplomatically isolated President Vladimir Putin and expanding Moscow's ties with Asia. Price negotiations on the 30-year deal continued into the final hours of a two-day visit by Putin to China, during which both sides had said they hoped to sign an agreement. Putin was in Shanghai for an Asian security conference where China's president called for a new model of Asian security cooperation based on a regional group that includes Russia and Iran and excludes the United States. Hand in hand: Russian President Vladimir Putin is greeted by his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia  summit in Shanghai, China . Seeking 'innovative' co-operation: Xi shakes hands with Putin before calling for the creation of a new Asian security alliance based on a regional group that includes Russia, but excludes the United States . Watching eachother's back: The Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building measures has taken on significance as Beijing tries to extend its influence abroad and limit the role of the United States . The gas deal gives Moscow an economic . boost at a time when Washington and the European Union have imposed visa . bans and asset freezes on dozens of Russian officials and several . companies over Ukraine. It allows Russia to diversify its markets for . gas, which now goes mostly to Europe. The . agreement 'opened the door for Russia to enter into Asia's gas market,' said Keun-Wook Paik, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for . Energy Studies. Politically, the deal has provided 'a breathing space for Russia,' Paik said. 'Russia, and Putin, can demonstrate it's not completely isolated because of the Ukraine crisis. 'Russia has demonstrated that they have a very reliable strategic partnership with China.' Bending his ear: Xi takes his seat between Putin and Iranian leader Hassan Rouhani (right) before the opening ceremony of the conference in Shanghai . China and Russia have been negotiating the oil deal for more than a decade but had been hung up over the gas price. The agreement calls for Russian government-controlled Gazprom to supply state-owned China National Petroleum Corp with 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually, Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov said. That would represent about a quarter of China's current annual gas consumption of nearly 150 billion cubic meters. The contract is worth a total of $400billion, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told Russian news agencies. Russia will invest $55billion in fulfilling the contract while China will invest at least $20billion, Putin told Russian reporters in Shanghai. Plans call for building a pipeline to link China's northeast to a line that carries gas from western Siberia to the Pacific port of Vladivostok. Russia's . economy has been bruised by its dispute with the West over Ukraine's . tilt toward the European Union, a shift that inflamed Moscow's . insecurities about declining influence and sparked its annexation of . Crimea in March. The supplies will help to ease gas shortages in China, the world's second-largest economy, and curb reliance on coal. The . U.S. treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, appealed to China during a visit . last week to avoid taking steps that might offset sanctions. However, American officials have acknowledged China's pressing need for energy. The . contract 'particularly important' at a time when Europe has threatened . to cut gas imports and reduce its dependence on Russia because of the . Ukraine crisis, said Alexander Lukin, a deputy head of the Russian . Diplomatic Academy under the country's Foreign Ministry, quoted by the . RIA Novosti news agency. 'We will be able to show to Europe that we have other customers,' Lukin said. Alexei . Pushkov, a Kremlin ally who is head of the international affairs . committee of the Russian parliament's lower house, said on Twitter: 'The . 30-year gas contract with China is of strategic significance. Obama . should give up the policy of isolating Russia: It will not work.' CNPC announced it had signed a deal but it gave no details. Putin met on Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping while gas negotiations continued in private. Meanwhile, Xi called today for . the creation of a new Asian security alliance based on a regional group . that includes Russia and Iran and excludes the United States.

Xi appeared to warn . some Asian nations about strengthening military alliances to counter . China, saying this would not benefit regional security. He also pledged to peacefully resolve . China's disputes over territory, which have intensified in recent years, . especially in the South and East China Seas. During a visit to Asia last month, .

"A Pittsburgh takeout restaurant that serves food from countries at odds with the United States has temporarily closed following a threatening letter. It comes after Conflict Kitchen launched a Palestinian menu, sparking outrage in the city's Jewish community and drawing criticism from many who said America is not in conflict with Palestine.

'Threats': Pittsburgh police are probing threats made to Conflict Kitchen after its Palestinian menu launched . Pittsburgh police are investigating the threat against Conflict Kitchen but declined to release details. Public safety spokeswoman Sonya Toler said Saturday that the letter was sent to police, but she wasn't sure when it was received. Conflict Kitchen said it would be closed until police could assess the credibility of the letter. It added: 'We hope to reopen shortly.' Controversial: The eatery only serves food from countries at odds with the United States, like Venezuela . 'Promoting understanding': The restaurant claims it hopes to present a balanced view of cultures . 'We have demonstrated this in the past by presenting the food, culture, and viewpoints of Iranians, Afghans, Cubans, North Koreans, and Venezuelans,' the eatery said in a blog post.

"The live tiger mascot for Louisiana State University has missed all seven homes games this season - opting instead to stay in his luxurious enclosure. Mike VI is the latest in LSU's dynasty of tigers that have represented the team since 1936. Between games, he lives in a 15,000-square-foot environment with a waterfall, stream, rocks, trees, and personal carers. But for the past few weeks, his keepers have failed to coax him into the bespoke cage that takes him to the Tiger stadium just across the street, where there is a bronze statue of him standing by the entrance. Not in the mood? Mike VI has refused to leave his enclosure to go to LSU matches across the street . Settled at home: Here the nine-year-old appears more comfortable in his 15,000-square-foot enclosure . Traditionally, nine-year-old Mike is driven around the stadium as cheerleaders perform their routine on top of his trailer. He is then stationed by the opposing team's locker room, roaring menacingly as they emerge onto the pitch. But it seems he may have had enough - and has also chewed up the LSU sign in his habitat. Fans are distraught, with many calling and writing to LSU executives with suggestions. Dr David Baker, the univeristy's director of lab animals and Mike VI's vet, defensively rebuffed the criticism, telling USA Today: 'Cat people know that cats do what cats are going to do. 'Life is on their terms. You can't force them and we have no way of forcing him. OK? I'll say that again. Menacing: Mike is the latest in a dynasty of tigers who instill fear in the opposing team by roaring as they arrive . Ritual: He is normally carted around the Tiger stadium with cheerleaders on his trailer to the delight of fans . Abandoning the team? Mike has also chewed up the LSU sign that used to hang in his habitat over the road . Luxurious: Mike's abode is decked out with a pool, a waterfall, rocks, trees and Italian structures . Living the life: He has a team of vets and carers that routinely check his teeth and pamper his paws . 'We have no way of forcing him. We wouldn't if we did. You can't entice them. 'People call me with brilliant ideas. ""Put a steak in the trailer!"" Oh wow, 20 years we never thought of that. 'When cats think something is up, they're very wary animals and this is an apex predator. 'He's a fully mature tiger. He's perfectly normal. They're secretive animals. Substitute: Crowds have had to make do with a man in a tiger costume for the last seven games . Help? LSU's coach Les Miles has appealed for four or five slow-moving adults to help get Mike to games . 'Why would he ever come out of his night house and get in the trailer? The fact that he ever does amazes me. 'He's exhibiting perfectly normal behavior and that's to stay put. End of story.' However, LSU coach Les Miles was more reticent, appealing on his weekly radio show for volunteers to help get Mike to matches.

"The passage of 70 years may have taken its toll in other ways. But it has done nothing to dull their memories or dim their pride, as this remarkably powerful collection of photographs makes clear. Gathered for the Mail, these are the men and women of D-Day, then and now. The stakes were never higher than on the morning of June 6, 1944, when an Allied force of 156,000 stormed the Normandy beaches. Eddie Wallace, 90, was serving with  86th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Honourable Artillery Company and landed at Juno Beach. The memories are still hauntingly vivid. 'I still can't forget all the dead bodies that were floating around us when we landed,' he says. 'One or two of the lads were sick when they saw that.' Pat Churchill, 90, was with the 2nd Royal Marines Armoured Support Regiment, which landed on Juno Beach. He can't  forget all the boats that were sunk. Around 90 landing craft were lost out of 306 vessels on Juno alone. 'There must have been hundreds of men who died and I was thinking, you poor devils,' he recalls. Vera Hay, 92, of the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, was one of the first nurses to arrive after D-Day and took care of up to 200 injured soldiers a day at her field hospital, both British troops and German PoWs. 'They needed rehydration, rest and morphine, and we were using a new  medicine - penicillin,' she says. Even now, Fred Glover still cannot bring himself to say what’s in his mind when the Last Post sounds. Some things are between him and the chaps who never came home. He would have been among them had an act of kindness to a wounded German not saved him from summary execution. This week, these veterans will return to Normandy, as many do every year. This time, though, they will be accompanied by royalty, heads of state, tens of thousands of well-wishers and battalions of international media for the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Geoff Pattinson, 90, of 9th Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, was in one of the gliders but the tow rope snapped before they got to France, forcing the glider to land. 'I couldn't believe we had landed in England,' he remembers. He flew again that day and was wounded later in Normandy by a  German machine gun. David Tibbs, 94, a Captain Medical Officer in the 225th Field Parachute Ambulance,  6th Airborne Division, treated hundreds of paras severely injured in the drop and was awarded the MC. 'I was looking out of the Dakota and saw the surf breaking on the coast,' he recalls. 'At that moment we were given the order to jump.' Frank Rosier, 88, a private serving in 2nd Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment, landed on Gold Beach. Three months later, in intensive fighting in Normandy, he was wounded by a mortar, losing his eye. 'The carnage on the beach brought me to a complete standstill,' he remembers. 'It was so horrific it has stuck with me to this day.' Stretched across a 50-mile front, it was a vast battlefield. Yet two of those pictured here will be going back to the same spot. Their story exemplifies the courage and sacrifice of countless Allied troops. Fred Glover and Geoff Pattinson were among 750 men of the Parachute Regiment’s 9th Battalion — 9 Para — whose task was to land at night by parachute and glider and seize the enemy gun battery at Merville, which threatened carnage when thousands of British troops landed on Sword Beach at dawn. Their plan went awry from the start, as much of 9 Para came down in the wrong place. Many drowned in flooded fields, and  commanding officer Lt-Col Terence Otway reached the battery with just 150 men. Eddie Linton, 88, was a Royal Navy able  seaman on board the River-class frigate HMS Mourne. His defining memory of that momentous day? 'Coming on deck for watch early that morning and seeing all those ships. I'd never seen so many ships in all my life. That's when I knew something was going to happen.' Fred Glover, 88, was a member of 9 Para, and assigned to crash-land in a glider on the Merville gun battery and take it out. He was wounded, captured, narrowly escaped execution, and later escaped from a Paris hospital, 'When we crashed, we immediately ran into a German patrol,' he remembers, 'and we sprung into action.' Alastair Mackie, 92, an Air Commodore  flying Dakotas with the RAF's 233 Squadron, dropped members of the 3rd Parachute  Brigade. Taking off at one in the morning, he flew straight to the drop zone. It was hairy stuff, he recalls. 'The Royal Navy were to our right and I was terrified they would  mistakenly shoot us down.' Edwin 'Ted' Hunt, 94, was a captain in the Royal Engineers, commanding ferries on Gold Beach. He remembers how quickly the wounded were being attended to and returned to England by landing craft. 'It  was hugely reassuring that if we did get injured we could be back in England that afternoon,' he says. One of the three gliders had aborted over England while the other two were shot up on the way in. Fred, in one of them, was shot through the legs. He crawled out of the wreckage and straight into a German patrol that he helped to fight off while the main force heroically overran the battery.

"Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar believes his former club have already identified Mexican stopper Guillermo Ochoa as a possible replacement for Simon Mignolet. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers said the Belgium international would be sidelined for an 'indefinite' period after dropping him for the match at Manchester United a fortnight ago. However, the 26-year-old earned an unexpected reprieve when Brad Jones was forced off with a thigh injury 15 minutes into the 1-0 Boxing Day win against Burnley. Simon Mignolet's place in Liverpool's starting line-up is far from safe, claims Bruce Grobbelaar . Despite playing his part in a 4-1 win against Swansea on Monday night, Liverpool legend Grobbelaar believes the Belgian may be on borrowed time with 2014 World Cup star Ochoa in the frame. He told talkSPORT: 'I’m not really any more encouraged by Mignolet [following his dropping]'. 'He's learned his lesson. He needs to play better. I'm a stickler on goalkeepers that don't start in the right position and his starting positions have been all wrong. 'Liverpool need another goalkeeper and I believe Ochoa from Mexico has been looked at.' Grobbelaar believes Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa could soon replace Mignolet at Anfield . Ochoa came to people's attention after starring for Mexico during the 2014 World Cup . Grobbelaar also claimed Mignolet's starting positions were 'all wrong'","Liverpool are looking at Guillermo Ochoa, claims Bruce Grobbelaar .

"Four players were sent off - and three in nine minutes - during a red hot Mexican championship final as America beat UANL Tigres 3-0 in the second leg at the Azteca to win a record 12th league title. It was the perfect way for the Eagles' Argentine coach Antonio Mohamed to bow out after confirming  he was leaving the club after news leaked midweek they were lining up Uruguayan Gustavo Matosas his successor. Ecuador's Michael Arroyo, Paraguayan central defender Pablo Aguilar and Mexico striker Oribe Peralta scored the goals that dashed Tigres' dreams of a fourth title after winning the first leg 1-0 at home in Nuevo Leon on Thursday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch three players sent off in nine minutes . Tigres' players surround referee Paul Delgadilo after he sent off goalkeeper Nahuel Guzman . That sending off was one of four in the match and three in a staggering nine minutes . America controlled the match from the start and Arroyo gave them the lead in the in the 36th minute with a superb shot from a tight angle that beat goalkeeper Nahuel Guzman, levelling the aggregate score. After Aguilar had headed America into the lead on the hour, Tigres' Colombian substitute Hernan Dario Burbano was shown a red card for bringing down goalbound midfielder Miguel Layun less than two minutes after coming on. Three minutes later the visitors were down to nine men when Argentine midfielder Damian Alvarez was sent off for hitting an opponent. Argentine goalkeeper Guzman, who had earlier complained that America fans were directing lasers at him, was the third Tigres player sent off in the 72nd minute for a second yellow card for a foul after play had been halted for offside.

Peralta scored America's third goal in the 78th minute but their substitute Luis Mendoza was shown a straight red card for making fun of Tigres players. 'We were the best team so I'm very happy for this group of players,' Mohamed told Televisa. 'I was brought here to be champions and make history and it's done.' On Saturday, he had said: 'I'm saying goodbye because my dignity comes before everything else. When there's talk of another coach, I get my things and head home. 'But this is football, the (directors) are within their rights to hire another coach, I just didn't like the timing or the manner,' added the Argentine, who joined a year ago when Miguel Herrera left America to take charge of Mexico's World Cup team. America have won one more title than arch-rivals Guadalajara. It was Mohamed's second Mexican title as coach after leading Tijuana to the Apertura two years ago. He is being succeeded by Matosas, who steered Leon to the Apeertura and Clausura championships last season.","America beat Tigres to clinch the Mexican league title .

"Ask any woman to tip out the contents of her make-up bag and you’re likely to be met with a guilty grimace. A survey revealed that the average British woman requires 55 minutes to get ready each morning — and that doesn’t include showering. If skincare is included, 11 per cent of us slap an extraordinary 40-plus products on to our faces every day. I have always considered myself fairly low-maintenance — yet when I turn out my make-up bag, I am shocked to discover I regularly use a whopping 16 different products, from BB (blemish balm) cream to concealer to eyeshadow. Scroll down for video . Sarah Chalmers models a more made up look (left) and one using just three cosmetic items (right) The contents of my battered bag add up to £289 and applying them all takes me 25 minutes. But in an age of multi-tasking, why can’t a lipstick double up as a blusher, or a foundation work as a concealer? As a working mother-of-three, finding the time for my entire beauty routine can be a luxury. But what if I could apply one product instead of five? With this in mind, I swapped my usual 16 products for just three, multi-function items. Here’s how I got on . . . THE SUPER FOUNDATION . Max Factor Face Finity All Day Flawless 3 in 1 Foundation . WHAT: Max Factor Face Finity All Day Flawless 3 in 1 Foundation, £12.99 for 30ml . THE CLAIM: This ‘holds like a primer, corrects like a concealer, with the long-lasting finish of a liquid foundation with SPF 20’. REPLACES: BB cream, primer, foundation, concealer and translucent powder, which cost £110. APPLICATION: I brushed the foundation to my face, then blended. I applied more around the dark shadows of the eye area as I would a concealer. This took all of one minute, whereas my usual five products take me nearer ten. The effect was fine until after lunchtime when this multi-function make-up needed topping up. EXPERT OPINION: Celebrity make-up artist Oonagh Connor, who has tended the faces of Marie Helvin and Fiona Bruce among others, says: ‘I didn’t think this blended well. It’s also effective to have a separate concealer.’ VERDICT: The 3 in 1 is certainly cheap, fast to apply and lightweight to carry. But it didn’t hold well on my skin, all but sliding off. A handy standby for when I’m on-the-run, but I won’t be swapping my five trusty regulars for this. 4/10 . CHEEKS AND LIPS . WHAT: Nudestix Lip and Cheek pencil, £24 (includes sharpener) THE CLAIM: ‘An extra-creamy soft-feeling lip-liner, lip colour and cheek cream all in one’, promising colour, cover and ‘blendability’. Nudestix Lip and Cheek pencil . REPLACES: Lip-liner, lipstick and gloss, blusher and highlighter, which cost £78. APPLICATION: I applied pencil around my lip line, then filled in over the lips themselves. I thought the sensation of using a pencil rather than a velvety lipstick would be odd, but it felt remarkably smooth. And when I simply drew a pencil-line on my cheeks, I was sure it would be obvious even after blending, but the effect was natural. EXPERT OPINION: Oonagh says: ‘This gives a lovely, dewy, natural look. On the lips, the creamy texture of the Nudestix lets you dab your finger to apply it like a tint, if you don’t want to pencil it on. It’s so easy to blend, it works almost like a highlighter, and I like the look of wearing the same colour on your lips and cheeks.’ VERDICT: Normally I would use different shades for lips and cheeks, but I loved this and would use it again. Even the tin box it comes in looks classy. 10/10 . EYE AREA . THE PRODUCT: Giorgio Armani Eye and Brow Maestro, £26.50, applicator, £20 . Giorgio Armani Eye and Brow Maestro . THE CLAIM: ‘A waterproof cream that features a dual transformation texture. The solid cream becomes liquid on application then sets on the skin for lasting hold.’ REPLACES: Two separate eyeliners, eyeshadow, brow pencil, brow fixer gel and mascara, worth £100. APPLICATION: Using a specially designed applicator — a brush at one end to shape the brows, and an angled flat brush at the other to apply liner or colour to the lid — I painted on a flicked line on top of my lashes, some shading underneath the eye, and blended colour on the lid. Using the eyebrow brush end, I put more colour on my brows. You can even brush a little on your lashes as a mascara. It took barely two minutes compared to the normal 11. Nothing smudged and it stayed on all day. EXPERT OPINION: Oonagh says: ‘I quite often use eyeshadow to colour brows. But I do think a lot of us would miss mascara.’ VERDICT: With nine shades to choose from, a tiny compact and a clever brush, this product is a multi-tasker. 9/10 . CAN 16 BECOME THREE? With the price of my make-up regime slashed by £204.50 (from £288 to £83.50), and the time needed reduced from 25 minutes to a scant five, the three wonder products are impressive, despite having to touch up the 3-in-1 foundation part way through the day. With more practice, I could achieve everything I get from my normal routine. But for a special occasion, I would stick with my carefully chosen, separate products.","The average British woman requires 55 minutes to get ready .

"Robert Williams, the ex wife of slain gangland figure Carl Williams, has admitted to being devastated by the latest news her eldest daughter has been charged with attempted murder. Danielle Stephens Williams was granted conditional bail in Melbourne's magistrates court on Friday after being charged with the attempted murder of a Melbourne man, who was taken to hospital with several gunshot wounds. The Herald Sun reported Sanar Ghanin, Stephen's boyfriend, is in custody after also being charged with the murder Serkan Kala in Melbourne. Roberta williams (pictured) daughter Danielle Stephens Williams has been charged with attempted murder of a Melbourne man . Danielle Stephens Williams, charged with attempted murder, is the step daughter of slain gangland figure, Carl Williams (pictured) Nine News reported The court was told the 22-year-old allegedly drove Mr Ghanin and his friend to confront the man, over a dispute, in Broadmeadows on Monday night. Robert Williams said she didn't want her children to follow in her footsteps and tried to give them the best of everything. 'Hence the reason why I have tried to give them that private school education, the things I didn't have in life, the mum that is there if they need someone to talk to,' she told the Herald Sun. 'I often say to my kids, ­'society owes you nothing.' Ms Williams who has vowed to stand by her daughter has described her as a 'good kid', hoping they can get past these accusations. Once the wife of criminal kingpin, Carl Williams, she said her life has now changed dramatically and it's now all about being a mum. 'I feel I was put on this earth to be a mum, that is a job I take very seriously,' she said. Danielle is one of three children from Ms Williams' relationship with Dean Stephens, a close associate of the Moran crime family. Danielle Stepehen Williams who has been charged with attempted murder, is one of three children from Roberta Williams' (pictured) relationship with Dean Stephens, a close associate of the Moran crime family . Last month it was found that Roberta Williams and daughter Dhakota could be eligible for up to $740,000 in victims of crime payouts due to Carl Williams' death in Barwon prison . She also has daughter Dhakota, now 13, to Carl Williams, who was beaten to death with the stem of an exercise bike by another inmate at Barwon prison in April 2010. Ms Williams' youngest child is three year old son, Giuseppe, with her current partner, Rob Carpenter. Last month it was found that Ms Williams and daughter Dhakota could be eligible for up to $740,000 in victims of crime payouts . Fairfax media reported the pair have been assessed as suffering severe mental impairment after the brutal death of Carl Williams in prison four years ago. An independent panel of psychologists and psychiatrists reportedly found they had a level of impairment which was believed to be at least 50 per cent. Although Victorian premier Denis Napthine says the government would protect taxpayers' interests at 'every opportunity' and fight the decision if there were any compensation payments to Roberta Williams, a convicted drug dealer. Ms Stephens is scheduled to return to court on Monday to sign an intervention order and will be scheduled to back in court again in February.","Danielle Stephens Williams, step daughter of slain crime figure, Carl Williams has been charged with attempted murder .

"This haunting photo shows a 21-year-old man posing on a Virginia trestle - just one week before he was struck and killed by a train while walking along the same tracks with his girlfriend. In the image, posted on Instagram, Jonathan Gregoire is seen standing at the edge of the trestle, near Lychburg, where he died and Victoria Bridges, also 21, was seriously injured on Saturday. Alongside the picture, the Liberty University student wrote lyrics from singer Noah Gunderson's 'Ledges', including: 'Here, I stand in the land of the rocks in the valley, trying to be a better man.' Mr Gregoire, from Wilbraham, Massachusetts, and Miss Bridges, from Newport News, were walking along the tracks with a group of friends at around 4.20pm when a northbound train approached. Although Mr Gregoire was fatally hit by the vehicle, Miss Bridges incredibly survived after leaping 100 feet off the railway bridge and landing on the terrain below. Chilling: This haunting photo shows Jonathan Gregoire, 21, posing on a trestle near Lychburg, Virginia - just one week before he was struck by a train and killed while walking along the same trestle with his girlfriend . Citing lyrics: The image, posted on Instagram, was accompanied by several lyrics from Noah Gunderson's 'Ledges', including: 'Here, I stand in the land of the rocks in the valley, trying to be a better man' Following the impact, the train driver told a dispatcher: 'There were three people that we could see, one beside the tracks, two out on the tracks,' according to ABC news. 'As soon as I got there, it was too late. Then I heard a thump. One of them, looked like a girl, jumped. And I heard the one thump, I’m pretty sure the girl jumped and I might have hit the guy.' Paramedics rushed to the scene, where they found Miss Bridges lying on the ground. She was airlifted to Lynchburg General Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, WDBJ reported. She remains in a stable condition. Mr Gregoire was pronounced dead at the scene. On Sunday, it emerged that Mr Gregoire, a senior majoring in business administration-marketing, had widely spoken of his passion for hiking, exploring and other outdoor pursuits on social media. He had also recently posted a series of messages about the meaning of life and death, with his last Facebook post reading: 'If life ends in the grave, then we have no ultimate purpose for living.' Another recent message said: 'I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God.' Killed: Mr Gregoire (pictured, left and right), from Wilbraham, Massachusetts, was walking along the trestle with a group of friends and his girlfriend, Victoria Bridges, on Saturday when a northbound train came . Airlifted: Although Mr Gregoire was fatally hit by the vehicle, Miss Bridges (pictured being stretchered away by medics) incredibly survived after leaping 100 feet off the railway bridge and landing on terrain below . Not uncommon: Witnesses say accidents like this are not uncommon for the trestle located above James River at Riverside Park near Lynchburg, VA . According to News Advance, more than one other person was walking along the trestle with Mr Gregoire and Miss Bridges when the train approached. However, the others were walking beside the tracks, not on them. Members of the friendship group were seen crying and walking behind the stretcher carrying Miss Bridges after the incident. Public safety officials were at the scene for approximately two hours. The incident is being investigated by Lynchburg Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division. Foul play is not suspected, according to ABC News. Robin Chapman, spokesman for Norfolk Southern, told News Advance that many use the trestle as a shortcut home or simply for the view from the trestle. Scene: Public safety officials were at the scene for approximately two hours after the accident . Group: Officials say a group of individuals, all appearing to be in their late teens, were walking along or near the trestle when the northbound train approached . Eerie: Mr Gregoire had recently posted a series of messages about the meaning of life and death, with his last Facebook post reading: 'If life ends in the grave, then we have no ultimate purpose for living. An autumnal walk: His post was accompanied by this photo of him and his friends walking in Riverside Park . Witnesses told ABC 13 that incidents like this are becoming common on this particular train trestle located above the James River at Riverside Park. 'It's kind of becoming a problem with, you know, the children and the teenagers that want to come up here and get on the railroad track,' local resident Julie Burgess told ABC 13. 'They're pretty much playing Russian roulette with their life.' In October 2012, a man was struck and killed by a train while crossing the tressle.

"Filming of Channel 4’s Immigration Street – the planned follow-up to its controversial Benefits Street show – has repeatedly been interrupted by angry residents who pelted camera crews with eggs and flour. Hostility to the project, set in Derby Road in Southampton, has grown so great that programme-makers are considering changing the name. Angry residents have put anti-Immigration Street posters in their windows to discourage filming while an alliance of public, private and voluntary organisations in the city has accused Channel 4 and Love, an independent production company, of trying to destroy the community it wants to portray. Outcry: Residents speak out against filming of Immigration Street, set in Derby Road in Southampton . Meanwhile, the programme-makers have been forced to retreat to side streets to complete filming for the series, due to be broadcast next year. An open letter to Channel 4, signed by Southampton’s police and crime commissioner Simon Hayes, along with health bodies, educational establishments, business organisations and local MP Alan Whitehead, has asked the station to reconsider its decision to push ahead with the ‘ill-named and ill-advised’ project. The letter says Derby Road is a ‘harmonious, open, thriving, successful and diverse community’ and adds that residents ‘do not want [it] to be stigmatised or damaged’. The letter continues: ‘We have tried to work with the production team but have been unsuccessful due to their reluctance to work constructively with the local community and us.’ Labour MP Mr Whitehead says he is attempting to force a parliamentary debate on the subject. ‘People feel powerless,’ he adds. Follow-up: The programme comes after controversial Benefits Street, which made a star of resident White Dee . ‘They don’t want this programme to be made. You can perhaps understand how frustrations arise and why they might manifest themselves in TV crews being pelted with eggs and flour.’ Satvir Kaur, a third-generation Sikh resident and a cabinet member on Southampton City Council, said: ‘I was really angry when I found out about this programme.’ Channel 4’s Nick Mirsky said that Love had invested significant time in meeting local people and organisations and was committed to ‘reflecting the authentic experience of people who live on or use Derby Road’.","Immigration Street is the planned follow-up to controversial Benefits Street .

"With an enormous light show, giant Santas and lots of sparkle, Tesco's 2014 Christmas offering is everything we have come to expect from their annual advert. But this year the company will be hoping the ad does more than boost Christmas sales as they attempt to claw back from a year that has seen them hit with scandal and massive financial losses. Shares in Tesco have plummeted in recent months as the supermarket issued three profits warnings and is facing an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations that bosses inflated profits by £250million. The ad opens with a father searching for the Christmas decorations in the attic, much to the delight of his sons . Hoping to prove they still put the customer first and are in touch with the average British family this year's advert focuses on the simple pleasures that come from out festive preparation. The moving advert begins with a father rummaging around the attic looking for boxes of decorations from last year, while his children wait eagerly downstairs. One by one we see families gathering to decorate their homes, while Tesco workers prepare to spread Christmas cheer. Scroll down for video . Focusing on the simple pleasures of Christmas, a man is seen battling the inevitable light tangle . The ad builds to the moment when Christmas lights are switched on in households and Tesco stores across the country. Tesco will be hoping that the show of community spirit and impressive light display in the advert, for which Tesco enlisted the services of Wieden and Kennedy London, the company behind the light show at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, will go some way to mend their damaged public image. The group has formally been placed under criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) following its discovery of a £263 million black hole in profit expectations. Following the allegations, eight of Tesco's executives have been suspended and last month the supermarket revealed its half-year profits had slumped 91 per cent to £112m. The bank has already set aside £240million for customers who were miss-sold payment protection insurance. The company even went so far as to force executives to shop and cook to get them in touch with customers. New chief executive Dave Lewis also has spoken of his wish to to make head office staff spend one day a fortnight in stores in a bid to stop customers deserting for German discounters Aldi and Lidl and to sweep away a culture at Tesco that included operating six corporate jets. As well as families across the UK we see Tesco staff getting ready for Christmas in store . Two siblings are seen rejoicing when the Christmas tree lights are switched on in a moving moment . Perhaps attempting ot show that it still puts the customer first, the festive light show at the end of this year's advert is inspired by a Tesco customer, Claire Hannah, who last year tweeted her disappointment that her local store in didn't have a green hat. In response Tesco created a winter wonderland at the store and invited Claire and over 800 local residents to enjoy the festivities and turn on the Christmas lights. The show, which culminates with the green hat being placed on the store, was created by the people behind the light show at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony. Nearly one million LED lights covered a huge 78m long and 7.2m high screen in front of the store. The full light show and the crowd's reaction can be seen in an additional film that Tesco is publishing on YouTube for customers. The advert made its debut on Sunday night during the season finale of ITV's Downton Abbey, ensuring that thousands across Britain saw it and marking the end of a week which has seen John Lewis, Argos, Marks and Spencer and Asda also reveal their Christmas campaigns. The ad builds to the moment when Christmas lights are switched on across the country, even by the sea . As well as the advert the store have launched their 'Every Little Helps Make Christmas' campaign . In addition to the advert, Tesco is launching a campaign, 'Every Little Helps Make Christmas,' which will celebrate the excitement around Christmas and focus on helping the nation celebrate. Their iconic green hat  will appear on over 700 Tesco stores across the country, more than ever before. Jill Easterbrook, Chief Customer Officer at Tesco says: 'Christmas is a wonderfully special time of year and we want to help customers in whatever way we can. Claire's experience is just one example of how we're doing every little thing we can to help make Christmas in fun and helpful ways. We're with our customers every step of the way through the festive season!' The festive light show at the end is inspired by a Tesco customer, Claire Hannah, who last year tweeted her disappointment that her local store didn't have a green hat . The delighted crowd in Wigan react to the light display which features one million LED lights covered a huge 78m long and 7.2m high screen in front of the store . Claire Hannah says, 'I was taken aback when Tesco first approached me - I couldn't believe my tweet had been noticed. It's amazing, Tesco has done a really lovely thing for the town, and I'm so chuffed our Tesco has the green hat this year!' Ray Shaughnessy, Creative Director at Wieden and Kennedy London says, 'This year's campaign is an important step change for Tesco in that they are doing all sorts of unexpected things to help people have a brilliant Christmas. 'It won't just be about them making sure you get the best turkey on the table, it will be about making sure that people feel Christmassy too. Getting the team behind the London 2012 Olympic light show to light up Wigan is a great example of this.' September 22: Four executives at Tesco suspended after the supermarket giant admitted it overstated its profits guidance to the City by £250million. Shares dived to their lowest level in 11 years as the revelation triggered its third profits warning in as many months. September 23: Firm plunged into further crisis as it emerged the chain's sales had fallen at their fastest rate in more than 20 years.

"Amid a bitter crisis in relations with the West over Ukraine, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has turned to China to form a new alliance. Putin, who called Russia's biggest neighbour his 'reliable friend, is in Shanhai to agree on a widely anticipated multibillion-dollar natural gas sale. A deal would give Moscow an economic and political boost at a time of Western sanctions, although  China has been warned by the US to avoid taking steps that might offset the ban. Scroll Down for Video . President Vladimir Putin met with China's president today in a diplomatic boost for the isolated Russian leader .

The Russian leader is hoping to extend his country's dealings with Asia and diversify markets for its gas, which now goes mostly to Europe . A deal would give Moscow an economic and political boost at a time of Western sanctions, while pressure on Moscow is thought to give Beijing leverage to push for a lower price .

'Significant progress has been reached . on gas, but there are issues that need to be finalized regarding the . price,' Peskov said, according to Russian news agencies.

Trump first made the claim during a Fox News Channel interview Monday morning, during a segment in which he also called Sterling's words about black people 'despicable.' At the end of that interview, he declared that Vanessa Stiviano, who allegedly made the now-infamous recording, was 'the girlfriend from hell, and that Sterling 'got set up by a very, very bad girlfriend, let's face it.' 'She was baiting him,' Trump added, 'and she's a terrible human being. And he gave horrible answers, and disgusting answers.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Trump, in his 26th floor Manhattan office, told MailOnline that left-leaning media failed to report how he was critical of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling following his alleged racist remarks . Trump waded into the Donald Sterling controversy on Monday but was later hammered for an offhand comment he made -- one he stands by . The comments came just hours before NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called Sterling's remarks 'deeply . offensive and hurtful,' banning the 81-year-old from . the NBA for life and fining him $2.5 million. 'I was criticizing him,' Trump insisted Tuedsay. 'But in addition, I was criticizing him for having this girlfriend, who was bad. She was bad news, okay?' On Fox, Trump had speculated that Sterling was 'close to incompetent' and 'led along by somebody who was so obviously looking to do harm to him.' On Tuesday he blamed the previous day's negative attention on 'dishonest reporters.' 'It . shows the dishonesty of much of the media,' Trump told MailOnline, 'because I gave 'em a long . segment about Donald Sterling, about how despicable it is – what he said . – and harsh action has to be taken, and just at the end I said, ""And . by the way, he has a girlfriend from hell.""' 'It was a total set-up,' Trump insisted Tuesday. 'The girl set him up, in my opinion. She set him up. That's what I'm saying.' He blamed Sterling for choosing 'the girlfriend from hell' 'I . always get a disproportionate amount of publicity,' he acknowledged, 'but I find that if I were a liberal Democrat, and I made . the exact same statements that I made about Donald Sterling – and I'm . not a fan, you understand that – it would have been treated much . different, of course. ... It probably wouldn't have been a story.' Trump, . who has nibbled around the edges of presidential politics, told . MailOnline that it was still 'too early' for him to decide whether to . make a White House run. He insisted that he would only do it 'for love . of country,' Sterling . has been widely condemned after Friday's release of the audio . recording, in which a voice sounding like his tells Ms. Stiviano that . she cannot bring black people to his basketball games or be photographed . with them. The male voice can be heard specifically talking about Magic Johnson – telling Stiviano, who is black and Mexican, that he doesn't want her 'associating with black people.' 'What he said was terrible and despicable and very strong action is going to be taken. There’s no question about it,' Trump said on Fox. He added . that in his opinion, Sterling 'could be out of it, frankly, based on his . actions. He could be pretty much out of it in terms of his whole . mentality.' The NAACP said Tuesday that it wants a meeting with Silver to . discuss the episode. United: Donald Sterling spotted leaving a Steak House with his wife Rochelle in El Segundo, Los Angeles. The disgraced owner of the LA Clippers came out of hiding just a day after a recorded phone conversation of Sterling making racist comments were released . Lastest lawsuit: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling and Vanessa Stiviano, who is being sued by Sterling's estranged wife Rochelle for $1.8 million and who allegedly recorded him making racist remarks . Roslyn M. Brock, the chair of . the NAACP National Board of Directors said the group wants to address 'the influence and impact of . racism in the National Basketball Association.' The organization's Los Angeles chapter has withdrawn its decision . to give Sterling a lifetime achievement award, and returned money he . donated. Sterling also made less public donations to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, to the city's Black Business Association, and to the United Negro College Fund. The UNCF told MailOnline on Monday that it would not return the $50,000 Sterling donated, since it was earmarked for scholarships. Bizarre: Vanessa Stiviano has refused to speak to the media since the scandal broke over the weekend .","Donald Trump told Fox & Friends he was disgusted by the LA Clippers owner's audiotaped slam on African-Americans .

Trump complained that some media outlets ignored the scorn he heaped on Sterling for being a racist – and for choosing the wrong lover .
'I were a liberal Democrat, and I made the exact same statements ... it would have been treated much different,' he jabbed ."

"Liverpool are hijacking Tottenham's move for England striker Saido Berahino. Sportsmail revealed Brendan Rodgers' intention to move for the West Bromwich Albion striker in November. And the Anfield club's interest is gathering pace ahead of the January transfer window, that re-opens on Thursday. The key stumbling block towards Berahino departing The Hawthorns next month remains the transfer fee. Liverpool want Saido Berahino in January but it is understood they are unwilling to meet the £25m valuation . Berahino has failed to score in his last 11 appearances for West Brom . The striker has only started one of West Brom's last five Premier League games . West Brom value Berahino, who has made the breakthrough into Roy Hodgson's England squad this season, at £25million. It is understood the Anfield club are unwilling to meet the Baggies' valuation, and will try to negotiate a lower fee. However, with West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace known to be one of the toughest negotiators in the business, that'll be easier said than done. Plans with regards to Liverpool's move for Berahino are said to be progressing well after Rodgers pinpointed the capture of a new striker as a January priority. Brendan Rodgers wants to add firepower up front in January and Berahino tops the list . Mario Balotelli has failed to register a goal in 10 Premier League appearances since joining Liverpool . Tottenham turned to Berahino after shelving plans to sign Jay Rodriguez, who is still recovering from injury . And Liverpool hope to storm ahead of Spurs in the race to land Berahino in the coming days. Tottenham have identified Berahino as the man they want to inject life into their forward line in January after shelving plans to sign Southampton's Jay Rodriguez. Spurs have made initial enquiries over a January switch for the forward, who has scored eight goals this season. Southampton forward Rodriguez remains a priority transfer target for Mauricio Pochettino, but the delay in his return from a knee injury has forced Spurs into re-assessing their January plans.","Saido Berahino is rated at £25million by West Bromwich Albion .

"A teenager who was robbed of her dreams by a motorist who skipped a red light is campaigning for a new law to clamp down on careless drivers. Miriam Parker, 18, had been attempting to cross a road in Croydon, South London, on New Year's Day this year when she was struck by the impatient motorist and left fighting for her life. Miriam, who was hoping to attend university in September to study nursing, suffered a serious brain injury and spent four weeks in intensive care and months in a rehabilitation centre. Miriam Parker, pictured left before her accident and right today, was knocked down by a driver who skipped a red light . She has had to learn to walk, talk and eat and undergone five operations - while the man that was found guilty of causing her accident received a mere four year driving ban and a £1,400 fine. The family were told that the Crown Prosecution Service did not think they could guarantee a conviction for dangerous driving - despite ignoring a red light. Magistrates were unable to impose a custodial sentence on Amin Aminullah and, along with a ban and a fine, he must pass an advanced driving test before he can regain his licence. Her mother Davina, 50, a church administrator, said the family were left 'disappointed' by the sentence. She has described the moment she was rushed to St George's Hospital in Tooting, where she convinced her daughter would be dead. 'It was shocking. Her face was so black and purple and swollen I could hardly recognise her,' she told the Sunday Telegraph. 'We were told it was touch and go, that Miriam might not live. 'We were given no promises, no one could predict if she would ever regain consciousness, or if she would be left in a vegetative state.' She slept in a chair in the hospital over the course of three weeks until Miriam was finally moved from the intensive care unit at the end of January and moved to the head injuries ward. Before the accident, Miriam had plans to go to university and study nursing, but now she has had to go back to school . It took Miriam a while to figure out where she was and why and she admitted she couldn't remember the accident at all, and thought it might have happened on the landing of her home, fighting with one of her sisters. Through physiotherapy she gradually began to get better - learning to walk, talk and eat again and in April she was discharged to a rehabilitation centre run by The Children’s Trust in Tadworth. During her time in hospital doctors had had to cut her long hair off and it was at the Trust that she made contact with charity the Little Princess Trust, who provided her with a real hair wig. She stayed there for 14 weeks before she was readmitted to St George's Hospital in August to have permanent metal plates put into her skull. In September she was discharged and went back to school but it was far from her dream of beginning a nursing course and lives at home with her mother in Carshalton, Surrey. Miriam still has some paralysis in her left hand and her right arm is numb in parts - but is still determined to get the best possible grades in her studies. Now, along with her two older sisters Kirsty, 21, a law student at University of Bristol, and Loren, 19, who is studying health and social care NVQs, Miriam is pressing for a new law to be introduced. The girls launched an online petition aimed at the Prime Minister David Cameron to introduce a new offence, of causing serious injury by careless driving, to the law. They state: 'On the 1st January 2014, our younger 17-year-old sister, Miriam, was hit by a car at a pedestrian crossing. 'The driver had driven through a red light. Miriam suffered a serious brain injury. She was not expected to survive. 'However, thanks to quick medical intervention and extensive continuing rehabilitation, she survived, albeit left permanently impaired and brain damaged. 'The effects of Miriam's accident have been life changing for all her family and friends, and most of all Miriam. 'She was due to go to university this year but it was put on hold. She struggles with every day things because of her disabilities. Miriam's mother Davina, 50, right, said the family were left 'disappointed' by the sentence and they are now campaigning for a change in the law after the man that knocked her over received a ban and a fine . 'The driver who hit her was only charged with 'driving without due care and attention' (careless driving). 'Under UK law, the typical punishment for this offence is 3-9 penalty points. A ban from driving is only discretionary.' Currently the law for careless driving only has two outcomes - causing death and all other results. For dangerous driving there are clauses set out, including causing serious injury by dangerous driving, which carries a maximum five year prison sentence. The sister's add: 'Our family feel that this is a huge gap in the law that needs to be filled. 'Why should the fortunate fact that someone survives affect the chance of the driver being disqualified? After the accident doctors had to cut off her hair and she was given a real hair wig by the Little Princess Trust . 'If she had died he would have received a one year mandatory disqualification and our family would not have had to worry about the prospect of him getting mere points for what happened.' 'We feel that it is time that driving offences were taken more seriously so that other families do not have to go through what we have been through. 'There needs to be more clarity in the law as to what constitutes ""careless"" as opposed to ""dangerous driving"", especially given the huge difference in punishment between these two offences, and a new offence of ""causing serious injury by careless driving"". 'Our family has felt incredibly let down by the justice system and we can only hope that things can improve for future victims like Miriam. 'Miriam may not have got the justice she deserved but we want to make sure other families do and do not have to go through what our family went through.'","Miriam Parker, 18, was at a pedestrian crossing when she was struck by car .

"A tourist from Belgium had her life saved in a dramatic rescue from the top of Jim Jim Falls in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. The 59-year-old's husband set off a beacon to alert emergency services to the situation. CareFlight carried out the rescue effort 11 days after a German tourist was found dead in a car park nearby, reports ABC. The Belgium tourist was rescued after getting stranded at the top of Jim Jim Falls in Kakadu National Park . CareFlight undertook the dramatic rescue in the Northern Territory . The amazing footage from CareFlight shows the paramedic coming out of the helicopter to the scene . Kakadu Park operations manager Anthony Contarino told ABC that the woman might have died if the emergency services had not have got to her in time. He said: 'A great deal of effort was put in by emergency services. 'Without all those things occurring, it might have been a very different outcome.' Mr Contarino explained that the temperature where the woman was stranded was 10 degrees hotter than on the ground and that the track to the top of the falls had been closed due to the heat. The 59-year-old woman was suffering from dehydration when she was found . He told ABC that they got news of the emergency beacon on Saturday afternoon and they spent the time searching for the patient. He explained that the woman was trapped in an area of the park which was closed and they would be carrying out an investigation into how it happened. He added that tourists walking on the tracks needed to be aware of the hot weather conditions and be 'responsible for their own safety'. Jim Jim Falls are 259 metres (850 ft) high and are located near the eastern boundary of the national park and 28 kilometres south of Jabiru. Kakadu Operations manager said the woman could have died if she had not been rescued .","The Belgium tourist was rescued at Jim Jim Falls in Kakadu National Park .

"A deputy who jumped on to roof of a 19-year-old's car and shot her dead will not be charged. Samantha Ramsey was killed by Boone County deputy Tyler Brockman as she left a party in April. Now, a Boone County grand jury has decided not to indict Brockman, who has always maintained he acted in self-defense, the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. Boone County Sheriff's Deputy Tyler Brockman (left) who witnesses say jumped onto the roof of Samantha Ramsey's (right)  car and opened fire on her will not be indicted in the girl's death . Ramsey was attempting to leave a field party along the Ohio River when Brockman tried to stop her car to determine whether she was impaired. According to a statement made by Brockman to his supervisor, the deputy said the teenager did not stop and instead struck him with her Subaru which is when he was thrown onto the hood of her car. As he tried to stay on the car, he says Ramsey speed up and, fearing for his life, he fired into the windshield four times. Ramsey was attempting to leave a field party along the Ohio River when Deputy Tyler Brockman (pictured) tried to stop her car to determine whether she was impaired . She does not stop: Ramsey's car keeps moving despite being approached by the police officer . An evidence report released by authorities Friday shows Ramsey had a blood alcohol content of .12 when Brockman killed her, reports WCPO.com. It also states Brockman's right boot had tire marks and his foot was bruised from Ramsey's vehicle. After her death one of Ramsey's passengers contested the deputy's story, insisting Ramsey did not hit the deputy, but that the deputy had jumped onto the hood. 'Today, the Grand Jury of Boone County heard all of the evidence and voted not to charge Deputy Brockman with any criminal wrongdoing,' Brockman's statement issued by his attorneys continued. 'The Grand Jury got it right.' Off camera: The shooting was not shown in the footage - the smoke is coming from the car after it crashed into a ditch . Shell-shocked: The passenger on the left side of the screen stumbled out of the car and collapsed onto the ground in tears, the driver of the car on the right threw his arms in the air just after the shots were fired . Devastated: Another person collapses into the street on the right side of the screen and rocks back and forth uncontrollably . The joint statement from Crawford and Boone County Commonwealth's Attorney Linda Tally Smith said that the 'Boone County Sheriff's Department has conducted the investigation since its inception.' In a statement sent to The Huffington Post, Ramsey's mom, Brandi Stewart, expressed her disappointment in the grand jury's decision. 'Now, over six months after my daughter was shot to death by Deputy Brockman, the only thing I know for sure is that he will not answer for his actions and that in Boone County, you cannot indict a Boone County Deputy for shooting an unarmed 19-year-old four times in front of numerous witnesses,' Stewart said. She added the investigation should have been handled by another law enforcement agency. 'The Community's concerns regarding the Boone County Sheriff investigating one of it own deputies have been confirmed,' Stewart said. 'The investigation should have immediately been turned over to another police agency.'","Samantha Ramsey was killed by Boone County deputy Tyler Brockman as she left a party in April .

"The high level of marriage between blood relatives within the Pakistani community accounts for nearly a third of birth defects in babies of Pakistani origin, a study shows. Cousins who marry run double the risk of birth defects in their children, says the largest study of its kind in the Asian community. The Bradford research found that up to six out of 100 babies born to parents in the city who are blood relations have birth defects, compared with three in 100 of those who have not inter-married. Cousins who marry run double the risk of birth defects in their children, according to the largest study of its kind in the Asian community (file picture) The Bradford rate is more than three times the national average of just under two per cent. The findings are likely to renew controversy over what many claim is a taboo subject because of the cultural and religious issues relating to first-cousin marriages. Ann Cryer, Labour MP for Keighley during the last Parliament, condemned cousin marriages, saying they harmed children and were arranged to keep wealth and property within families. She said they put a strain on the NHS in areas with big Pakistani communities because many children needed treatment for often disabling genetic disorders. Similarly, Phil Woolas, environment minister at the time, said the genetic problems had to be addressed as a ‘matter of public health’ by anyone who was supportive of the Asian community. The new study collected data on 11,300 babies involved in the Born in Bradford project, a long-term study following the health of babies born in the city between 2007 and 2011. Ann Cryer (left), former Labour MP for Keighley, condemned cousin marriages, saying they harmed children and were arranged to keep wealth and property within families while former environment minister Phil Woolas (right) said the genetic problems had to be addressed as a 'matter of public health' Of these, 45 per cent were Pakistani and 40 per cent white British. Previous research has suggested a higher risk of health problems for babies born as a result of consanguinity – marriage to a blood relation – including studies involving Jews, Arabs and Romany gipsies. But this is the biggest so far, and its size allowed researchers to rule out an effect caused by deprivation. Study co-author Professor Neil Small, from the University of Bradford, said it would be wrong to use the findings to dissuade blood relatives from marrying. ‘But we do want to ensure that couples are aware of any risks so that they can make informed choices when planning their families,’ he added.","Research found cousins who marry double the risk of defects in children .

"A mother who was stabbed five times in the stomach as her cage fighter ex-boyfriend tried to kill their unborn child has told how she screamed 'he's killed the baby'. Lauren Oliver, 26, said she dreads the day she must tell Harper, now a healthy five-month-old, how her father almost killed them both, seven months into the pregnancy. Professional fighter Nicholas Leaning, 28, was jailed for 19 years last week for the assault on the doorstep of Miss Oliver's Scunthorpe home, with a judge describing him as a 'ticking time bomb'. Lauren Oliver, 26, said she dreads the day she must tell Harper, now a healthy five-month-old, how her father Nicholas Leaning (right) tried to end both their lives seven months into the pregnancy . Miss Oliver told how the thug was wearing his cage fighter mask when he punched her on the head then repeatedly knifed her. 'As Nick stabbed me I just kept begging him not to kill Harper, not to kill my baby, but he just kept stabbing me,' she told the Sunday People. 'I was shouting 'Please Nick, please don't kill us.' Then he stopped. I looked up and saw he was wearing his cagefighting mask over his mouth and nose. 'He just stared at me and I knew he was grinning because his eyes creased up. Then he stabbed me a fifth time and ran off.' Miss Oliver said how she screamed 'he's killed the baby' after the attack on the doorstep of her home . The cage fighter (left) was cleared of attempted murder but convicted of wounding with intent and attempted child destruction at Hull crown court . Leaning had been cheating on Miss Oliver with his ex-girlfriend and when she told him she was pregnant the professional fighter told her to get an abortion. He told her he would deny the child was his and would kick it out of her if she didn't get rid of it. But once she refused he feared he would be exposed as a cheat and launched his assault. He was cleared of attempted murder but convicted of wounding with intent and attempted child destruction at Hull crown court. 'How can someone do that to their own child? I can't believe Harper and I survived. Every time I hold her I think how lucky we are,' said Miss Oliver. Leaning had been cheating on Miss Oliver with his ex-girlfriend and when she told him she was pregnant the professional fighter told her to get an abortion . 'The biggest comfort is knowing he's behind bars and can't touch us again. Harper will be grown by the time he gets out, but I still have to tell her what happened. How can I hide it? 'She would find out sooner or later but then how do you tell someone their own dad tried to kill them before they were even born? 'It's disgusting - he's disgusting.' Miss Oliver was drenched in blood after the attack, but dragged herself out of the house and screamed her help from her neighbour. Miss Oliver said the cage fighter was wearing his mask during the attack at her Scunthorpe home . 'I was shouting, 'He's killed the baby, Nick's killed her,' she said. 'I lifted my top up and fleshy tissue was hanging on my right side. I felt really woozy but I wanted to stay awake to know if my daughter was alive.' She was taken to Scunthorpe General Hospital where surgeons were waiting to  deliver her baby by caesarean section six weeks before due date. Surgeons said Harper survived as she was in the breech position and Miss Oliver's pregnancy fat protected her from the full force of the knife. Her mother described the moment she heard her heartbeat and realised she was alive. 'Suddenly I heard it. Boomboom, boom. Somehow she was alive. 'I couldn't believe it. It was the sweetest sound I had ever heard.' Harper was delivered weighing just 4lb 1oz and Lauren had 46 staples in five external and seven internal wounds. The blade nicked her uterus twice. Miss Oliver said nurses had to take a picture of Harper to convince her that she had survived. She revealed that she had been in a 'great' relationship for around two years before she discovered he had rekindled a relationship with his ex-partner Lindsay Coombs. After she found out she was pregnant she went to see Miss Coombs for proof that they were back together. 'We found out he had been with us both all along. I found out I was pregnant, and when I told him he told me to I had to go and get an abortion, but I didn't want to,' she told the court. 'He said I had to get rid of it but when I wouldn't, he said he didn't want anything to do with it.' She now suffers panic attacks and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress.","Pregnant Lauren Oliver, 26, was stabbed in the stomach by ex-boyfriend .

"Arrested: Megan Welter is accused of assaulting her boyfriend after an argument over a text message . An Iraq war veteran turned cheerleader for the Arizona Cardinals has been arrested for assaulting her boyfriend at her Scottsdale home. Megan Welter called police for help getting her professional fighter boyfriend to leave her home after the couple argued about a flirty text message he had sent to an ex-girlfriend. When police arrived at her home however, it was Welter who was arrested after cell phone footage recorded by her boyfriend showed the 29-year-old cheerleader hitting and scratching him and yelling: 'Who is she?' as he pleaded with her to stop, according to 3TV. The argument began in the early hours of Saturday, July 20, after the couple went out drinking to celebrate Welter's birthday. In the 911 call, Welter claimed she was . choked and had her head smashed on a ceramic tile floor. She then told . the operator: 'I'm a NFL cheerleader, I cannot have ...' before her . voice trails off. Her boyfriend, named by Right This Minute as Ryan McMahon, told police Welter thought he resented her after she aborted their baby against his wishes a month earlier. When the couple, who have been dating for about six months, returned to Welter's home, they started to argue about a text message the boyfriend had sent. As he was questioned by police . outside Welter's home, he explained he had sent a jokey text . to an ex-girlfriend who had sent him a picture of a dog. He replied with a message that read: 'Are you trying to turn me on with a girl dog?' In footage police filmed as they interviewed him outside the house, he held out his phone and told them repeatedly that he filmed the attack, as he denied harming Welter. In the footage he recorded, Welter can be heard demanding: 'Who is she? Who is she?' as she  scratched him and pulled his hair while he quietly asked her to stop and let him leave. In the 911 call Welter, who spent 16 months serving her country and leading a platoon in Iraq, claimed that her boyfriend had choked her until she went dizzy, 'smashed [her] head into a tile' and was refusing to leave the house.

Welter was arrested for alleged assault, disorderly conduct and criminal damage. She had been publicly praised last week, after details were revealed of how the Iraq war veteran had become a cheerleader. She told Azcardinals.com that joining the military was simply the 'right thing to do.' Welter was then sent overseas as a signal officer. 'I was deployed to Joint Base Belad . which is about an hour North of Baghdad. At first, it was scary . you know, but um, it's what I signed up to do,' she explained to ABC15. While threatened by incoming mortars and rockets at the base in Iraq, she was reminded of another of her dreams when an NFL team visited, complete with their cheerleading squad. Welter says she talked to the girls and got tips about life as a cheerleader, as dancing had a long been one of her major passions. 'I started when I was three, my mom put me in a tiny, tiny tot class,' she explained to ABC. 'I picked it back up when I was nine, and I loved it, so I danced competitively at a studio from age of nine, all the way through high school, and then I was on my college dance team.' Service: Welter had previously spoken of her pride during flag ceremonies and the national anthem before Cardinals games . After returning for Iraq she tried out for the Cardinals squad and, despite being one of the older entrants, was selected. Welter, who is also a reservist in communications for the military police in Scottsdale, Arizona, spoke of her excitement before a big game for the Cardinals. The veteran and cheerleader told ABC15: 'When you see the flag, it means a lot, you know, because our country has given us so many freedoms and to be a part of fighting for that and maintaining that, it, it means a lot. So yes, it gives me goose bumps, I can't help it.'","Footage shows Megan Welter hitting and scratching professional fighter .

"The Queen failed to mention her German ancestors in her 1972 Christmas Day TV broadcast for fear of provoking a ‘snide’ public backlash, according to previously unseen official papers. They show she had planned to refer to her ‘continental relations’ but had a change of heart after talks at the highest levels of government. The seeming embarrassment about her close family ties echoed that of the First World War, when fierce anti-German feeling led to the Royal Family changing its name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. Queen Elizabeth II with the then Prime Minister Ted Heath (left) and American President Richard Nixon (right) In 1972, the then Prime Minister Edward Heath – who had been shown the speech in advance – told the Queen she could refer to Britain’s forthcoming membership of the Common Market in her Christmas broadcast only if her comments were personal and stressed her own ties with Europe. But on December 1, 1972, Sir Robert Armstrong, Heath’s Principal Private Secretary, told him: ‘You suggested [the Queen] might make her references to Europe personal: referring to the historical links we have with Europe... or her own personal ties of kinship with families in many parts of Europe. In the end her advisers have felt this would make the broadcast longer than she wishes; they also fear references to her continental relations will give rise to snide remarks.’ The Royal Family gained the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha name when the Queen’s great-great grandmother, Queen Victoria, married Prince Albert in 1840. The couple’s son, King Edward VII, and their grandson, King George V, both ruled as monarchs using the German surname. These close links were considered acceptable until the First World War, when British public opinion struggled to cope with the fact that Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm II was a grandson of Queen Victoria and a cousin of George V. In 1917, George V – the Queen’s grandfather – was forced to change the family’s name to the more British-sounding Windsor after a huge rise in anti-German feeling. Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II (pictured) was a grandson of Queen Victoria and a cousin of George V . The previously unseen papers in the National Archives, which cover the Queen’s Christmas speeches from 1952 to 1973, show she often reads from texts prepared by those who are not part of the Royal Household. They reveal Prime Ministers are shown the speech in advance, can make alterations, and have even stopped the Queen including topical references to contentious issues. In 1973, Heath advised the Queen that a reference to the country’s industrial woes and the three-day week would risk her political neutrality. The papers show negotiations went right up to the wire. On December 5, 1973, Sir Robert told the Prime Minister: ‘It [the Christmas broadcast] has been recorded today, but could be redone if there was anything to which you took strong objection.’ However, the Queen has on occasion rebelled against these attempts at censorship, and in 1969 refused to record a Christmas message. It was seen as a protest at Harold Wilson’s decision to stop her mentioning the country’s economic woes in her 1968 speech. Civil servants were particularly nervous about that broadcast because the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh broke with tradition and decided to write it themselves. A Palace spokesman said: ‘The Queen’s Christmas broadcast is very such Her Majesty’s personal message to the UK and the Commonwealth. A draft is shown to the Prime Minister as a courtesy and because the Queen acts on the advice of her Government. As with other exchanges between the Queen and the PM, we would not comment on the detail or historical events.’","In 1972 Prime Minister Ted Heath told the Queen she could refer to the Common Market only if she stressed her own ties with Europe .

"The billionaire boss of Victoria's Secret is suing an auction house after he paid a record-breaking £10.9 million for a rare Ferrari despite an ongoing legal row over ownership. Les Wexner, 77, bought the 1954 Ferrari 375-Plus, one of just five built, at this summer's Goodwood Festival of Speed. It is the highest price ever publicly paid for a road-legal car in England and, at the time, was the world's third most expensive car sold at auction. Scroll down for video . The billionaire boss of Victoria's Secret bought the 1954 Ferrari 375-Plus, one of just five built, at this summer's Goodwood Festival of Speed . But the tycoon is unhappy over ongoing legal arguments regarding the ownership of the Ferrari and is demanding a full refund and damages. He has now launched a High Court lawsuit against the prestigious auction house Bonhams. Part of the Ferrari was stolen from Ohio in the 1980s and imported to Belgium, kicking off years of legal disputes on both sides of the Atlantic. Bonhams brought the US and European parties together and they signed an agreement designed to 'extinguish all claims and counterclaims' regarding the car in 2013. Les Wexner is unhappy over ongoing legal arguments regarding the ownership of the Ferrari and is demanding a full refund and damages . He has built a O large retailing and marketing conglomerate, which currently includes Victoria's Secret, Pink, Bath & Body Works, Henri Bendel and La Senza . The auction house was then appointed to sell the Ferrari with the catalogue stating that 'all relevant litigation' with the car had been 'settled'. But documents filed at the High Court dispute this claim. A statement issued on behalf of Wexner's lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, said: 'The allegations set out in the claim against Bonhams and the sellers are that despite their knowledge of the ongoing litigation in relation to the ownership of the car, false representations to the contrary were made to the buyer prior to sale, either fraudulently or recklessly.' The Ferrari, known as 0384 AM, was the star lot at the Goodwood Festival of Speed sale on June 27. It had been campaigned successfully in the 1950s, picking up a number of victories including a win at Silverstone. Part of the Ferrari was stolen from Ohio in the 1980s and imported to Belgium, kicking off years of legal disputes on both sides of the Atlantic . Under the bonnet is a 4.9-litre engine which developed a staggering 330bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of just four seconds and a top speed of 186mph. Mr Wexner has asked for a declaration of valid rescission of the sale of the Ferrari, restitution of monies paid by the buyer, damages and compound interest. The businessman and Copley Motorcars, a US dealer which acted for Mr Wexner at the sale, have declined to comment further. A statement from Bonhams said: 'We are satisfied that any claim is wholly without merit and will be strongly contested.'","Les Wexner, 77, paid £10.9 million for 1954 Ferrari 375-Plus at Goodwood .

"Eating certain pigment-rich foods daily can contribute to building up the skin's natural barrier to the sun's harmful rays. Particular fruits and vegetables such as dark purple berries and dark green veggies contain special protective compounds, and it's all down to their concentrated pigmentation. Dermatologists and skin scientists at the . forefront of photo-dermatology (the scientific study of ultraviolet . light and its effects on skin) have made the pioneering discovery. Eating certain foods can contribute to building up the skin's natural barrier to the sun's harmful rays . The body utilises the food's compounds near the skin's surface to give a base level of protection against damaging UV rays. Known as a Continual Dietary-Sun Protection Factor (CD-SPF), this is the first time scientists have ascribed an SPF value to diets based on the nature and quantity of natural plant pigments. One of the benefits of this approach is that all day long, even cloudy days when sun cream isn't used regularly, a 'base' level protection is supplied against the damaging effects of UV light. Food Chemist and Nutritionist Dr Sam . Christie explains: 'The level of protection against UV light can be . assessed in a similar way to which  sun creams are rated e.g. SPF10 or . 20; where the higher the number, the greater the protection against . damage from UV rays. By eating foods that protect your skin against UV . rays you are effectively achieving sun protection at all times of the . day and on all areas on your body.' Dermatologist . Dr Iaisha Ali notes: 'A Continual Dietary-SPF (CD-SPF) could be a . useful tool alongside appropriate sun cream use in achieving healthy . skin all year round. Furthermore, . a form of base SPF from dietary and supplement sources would provide a . degree of protection during relatively short sun cream-free times when . invaluable Vitamin D production takes place naturally.' Blackcurrants . Blueberries . Blackberries . Black grapes . Figs . Oranges . Butternut squash . Dark green peppers . Kale . Spinach . Dr Sam Christie tells MailOnline: 'Plants themselves are the heroes here. It's a matter of multi mechanistic effects. 'The plant pigments in these foods gravitate to the skin where they are deposited. 'UV light hitting the skin is slightly dissipated by the molecules the foods provide. With the right amount their energy isn't passed onto our delicate DNA. 'They help the skin cope with UV light by suppressing the damaging effects of sunlight, neutralising free radicals and reducing redness and inflammation. 'They can also help with the . anti-ageing skin effects on an extra-cellular level. The glue that holds . the skin together - mucopolysaccharides - is where collagen exists. The . health of that material is dependent on the type of food you eat. You . see relatively more severe wrinkling in people who eat less of these . fruits and vegetables. 'Plus they help with other more severe harm from the sun. 'When . light falls on the skin these plant compounds can help combat . photo-immuno suppression – if left unchecked this stage can lead to the . initiation and development of cancer cells in the skin. 'In . essence these multi-protective plant materials give the body the tools . it needs to help protect its delicate DNA from sun damage.’ Sun creams should not be used to increase sun exposure time but to increase protection . But to . obtain SPF 10 from diet alone, you would need to consume a portion of . kale and almost a kilo of black seedless grapes daily. While eating these 'super' foods contribute to protection from the sun's harmful rays, very few people actually eat enough of them on a daily basis to achieve a base level CD-SPF through diet alone. Colladeen® . Visage from naturesbest.co.uk, the first supplement that can provide skin with SPF, provides a . potent source of plant compounds for an average SPF 10 achieved after . 12 weeks of use. Sam . explains: 'While Colladeen® Visage will never replace the effectiveness . of a high SPF sun cream, it provides an all-year-round 'base' SPF and . the potential for reducing the long-term ageing effects of sun . exposure'. Six of the best sun creams on the market according to Which? Sainsbury Sun Protect £3.75 . Boots Soltan Dry Touch £5.50 . Asda Protect Sun Lotion £4 . Aldi Lacura Suncare £2.79 .

"Health experts have said alcoholics should be prescribed a once-a-day tablet to help them curb their addiction. (File picture) Alcoholics should be offered a once-a-day tablet on the NHS to try to help them curb their addiction, health officials have said. The drug nalmefene should be made available to heavy drinkers, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said in new draft guidance. Around 600,000 people across England and Wales could benefit from the drug in their struggle against alcohol addiction, the drug's manufacturers Lundbeck estimated. The drug helps to reduce the craving for alcohol by controlling the reward mechanism in the brain. The draft guidance from Nice states that nalmefene should be available as an option for those who are heavy drinkers but not those who require immediate detoxification. Experts said the drug could be prescribed to those alcoholics who have already taken the first steps on their road to recovery by seeking medical advice. 'Alcohol addiction is a serious issue for so many,' said Professor Carole Longson, director of Nice’s Health Technology Evaluation Centre. 'Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps in their fight against their addiction by visiting their doctor and taking part in therapy programmes. 'We are pleased to be able to make draft recommendations which can support people in their fight. 'When used alongside psychosocial interventions, nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial interventions alone.' A consultation has been opened on the draft guidance and it is expected final guidance will be published later this year. The drug nalmefene should be made available to heavy drinkers, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said in new draft guidance.

All Saturday tens of thousands Argentines poured into Rio, the majority without tickets. The queues for the Copacabana Fan Park was a few thousand strong hours before its opening and trains en route to The Maracana were literally rocking as Argentines - from gnarled old hooligan leaders to 12-year-old girls with flowers in their hair - running through their extensive repertoire of provocative songs as they bounced up and down, punching the walls with the equilibrium of the trains in constant jeopardy.

Watching on: The queues for Copacabana Fan Park was a few thousand strong hours before opening .

Music: Carlos Santana (left), Wyclef Jean (centre) and Alexandre Pires perform before the final . There was no sign of any protest near the stadium - largely because key leaders involved in the demonstrations against the World Cup were arrested the night before the final.

The police said that the detained leaders had been involved in violent protests in the past. Prepared: Hundreds of police officers gather outside the Maracana stadium for the World Cup final .

"The wife of an American Christian pastor imprisoned in Iran for evangelizing is praying for a miracle as she awaits her husband's impending trial and possible death sentence. Naghmeh Abedini, who lives near Boise, Idaho, has been told by her husband’s attorneys that she should expect the worst at Monday's trial, where Saeed Abedini, a father of two, faces the capital charge of compromising national security. Those who have been following Mr Abedini’s trial believe the charges are directly related to his work nearly a decade ago when he started a house church movement in the Islamic country. Deep fear: Naghmeh Abedini, the wife of American Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, who was imprisoned in Iran for evangelizing, is praying for a miracle as she awaits her husband's impending trial and possible death sentence . Abbas Pir-Abassi, the judge he will face on Monday, is infamous for sending defendants to the gallows, Foxnews.com reports. ‘There is a lot going through my mind. I can never clear my head. I only sleep two hours a night,’ Ms Abedini, 35, told the online news site from her parent’s home in Idaho. ‘Unfortunately, he has been set up for failure and a harsh sentence because of his beliefs. His attorney says that the court has gathered a large amount of evidence against him,’ she said. As the trial approaches, Ms Abedini and her husband's supporters are hoping that international pressure will prevent the Iranian regime from executing the 32-year-old pastor. The Obama administration has called on Iran to free Mr Abedini, though the United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran, National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said on Friday. ‘We remain troubled by the case of U.S. citizen Saeed Abedini, who was arrested by Iranian officials more than three months ago on charges relating to his religious beliefs. We call upon Iranian authorities to release him immediately,’ said Mr Vietor. 'Expect the worst': Mr Abendini's attorneys told his wife that she should expect the worst at Monday's trial, where the father of two faces the capital charge of compromising national security . Ms Abedini, who was born in Tehran and moved to the states with her family when she was nine years old, says she has had sporadic contact with her husband. The two have been able to correspond through letters smuggled out of Tehran’s notorious Evin prison and, occasionally, when relatives in Iran are able to speak to him by phone and conference her in, she says. ‘When I do get to speak with him, I don’t even know what to say,’ she told Foxnews.com. ‘What do you say when you only have four minutes?’ Mr and Ms Abedini met in Iran in 2001, during a trip the wife took back there, and the two married in their home country in 2004, under the rule of then-President Mohammad Khatami. The couple were allowed to have a Christian ceremony, though tolerance for Christianity and the evangelism that Mr Abedini practiced was quickly diminishing. By November of 2005, the couple who had helped establish a network of home-based Christian churches was forced to flee Iran under charges similar to those Mr Abedini now faces. ‘We lived in a nearby country until early 2006, we had to wait to come here until he was able to get a marriage visa,’ Ms Abedini recalled. Mr Abedini was granted citizenship in the U.S. soon after that and the couple moved to the states to raise their son and daughter, ages 4 and 6. However, the pastor felt the calling of his extended and his ministry in Iran and returned to the Islamic country. Praying for a miracle: Mrs Abedini is awaiting the news about her husband's trial from her parent's home in Idaho, where she is staying with their son and daughter, ages 4 and 6 . ‘He loves the U.S., but he missed his family,’ Ms Abedini said. In 2009, the couple decided to return to Iran and take a chance facing the charges against them. ‘We thought he would have been arrested once we arrived at the airport, but nothing happened,’ Ms Abedini said. Her husband was later arrested when the two returned to the airport for their flight home. Iranian authorities later freed Mr Abedini , allowing him to return to the U.S., but warned him not to do anymore evangelical work in Iran. Ms Abedini, however, says the couple was told they were free to return to their native country for secular humanitarian efforts. Last summer, Mr Abedini went back to Iran to help open an orphanage with the state’s backing, his wife says. During that trip, the pastor was pulled off a bus, placed under house arrest and then moved to Evin prison in September. The specific allegations against him have not been made public, though supporters say his trial is almost certainly related to his conversion from Islam to Christianity in 2000 and his efforts to spread the gospel in Iran over the following years. Mr Abedini, himself, is unaware of the charges against him, according to a letter he recently was able to sneak out of his prison cell. ‘This is the process in my life today: one day I am told I will be freed and allowed to see my kids on Christmas (which was a lie) and the next day I am told I will hang for my faith in Jesus,’ he wrote. ‘One day there are intense pains after beatings in interrogations, the next day they are nice to you and offer you candy.’ Jordan Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice, which has fought to bring attention to Abedini's plight, told Foxnews.com that he hopes the Obama administration will continue to press Iran on the matter of Mr Abendini’s release. ‘The statement released today is encouraging,’ Mr Sekulow said in reference to Mr Vietor’s words this week. ‘It is our hope that the Secretary of State and the State Department fully engage this issue and call for his immediate release. ‘We urge them to utilize all of their diplomatic resources to secure the freedom of this U.S. citizen who is being persecuted and facing grave danger because of his religious beliefs.’ Unknown: The specific allegations against Mr Abedini have not been made public, though supporters say his trial is likely related to his conversion from Islam to Christianity in 2000 and his efforts to spread the gospel in Iran .","In November of 2005, Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, 32, and his wife Naghmeh, 35, were forced to flee Iran for evangelizing in the Islamic country .

"Aussies are known for possessing a unique sense of humour and the Mambo surf clothing label has successfully tapped into this market for the past three decades. The fact that the company's most popular design is a dog emitting musical gas out of his backside sums up the the quirky larrikinism of the artists commissioned for the work, . Dare Jennings established Mambo in Sydney in 1984 and appointed Wayne Golding as artistic director. Scroll down for video . The dog emitting musical gas out of his backside is Mambo's biggest seller over the past 30 years. Richard Allan designed 'Farting Dog Call Of The Wild' in 1987 . One of Reg Mombasa's most popular designs - Jesus handing out pies and beers at the football instead of loaves and fishes . The latest designs still have that equally quirky edge with one of many being Bananas in Balaclavas . Sydney rock band Mental As Anything guitarist, Reg Mombassa, joined the team two years later and to this day remains one of the label’s best-selling artists. Mombassa's most popular designs are the Aussie Jesus handing pies and beers out at the football instead of loaves and fishes and the 'Beer Tree' which was in the shape of Australia with native animals asleep after drinking too many cans. 'It became successful because of the interesting content - surf labels were pretty boring before Mambo,' he said. 'It developed a life of its own as an art movement - albeit a commercial one.' A 2014 design created by Ben Brown called 'Flashes and Bones' Aussies are known for possessing a unique sense of humour and the Mambo surf clothing label has successfully tapped into this market for the past three decades . Mombassa's 'Beer Tree' design is another winner with of inebriated native animals passed out . Jennings and Golding left Mambo marking the end of the ‘Old School’ era of the label and signalling the beginning of its ‘New School’ period when Angus Kingsmill bought the brand in 2008. Kingsmill said the clothing label stands out from the pack. 'It taps into the Australian sense of humour with talented artists with designs offers social comment - I'm not aware of any clothing label like it in the world,' he said. 'The great thing about Mambo is it never taken the fashion industry seriously and will poke fun at everything including themselves.' The quirky theme seems to run through most of the Mambo items - this is a Jeff Raglus design 'Chariot Goddess' from 1993 . The latest designs still have that equally quirky edge with Bananas in Balaclavas, Che Guevara in Mickey Mouse ears and a watermelon smoking a bong with the title: 'Never Lend A Watermelon Money'. The designs are both politically incorrect - as well as political - with a classic example being the ‘Rednecks’ T-shirt in response to Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party. Profits from the sale of the T-shirt eventually enabled Mambo to hand over a cheque worth $100,000 to the National Aboriginal and Islander State Development Association, whose funding would have been placed in jeopardy had One Nation achieved a greater percentage of the vote.

"The bouncer has been a staple of cricket since Fred 'The Demon' Spofforth is said to have parted W.G. Grace's beard in the earliest of Ashes battles - but the tragic passing of Phillip Hughes has even Merv Hughes, among the best exponents of the short ball, unsure when it will be a part of the game again. Asked by Daily Mail Australia, what he thought will happen to the often intimidatory clashes between fast man and top-line batter, Merv Hughes said: 'I can’t begin to think for the current players but certainly the tragic passing of Phil Hughes will be on everyone’s mind for a little while.' 'Different people will handle it in different ways and it may take someone a little longer to get over it.' Scroll down for video . 'I’d suggest fast bowlers will be very mindful of the damage they can do,' said Merv Hughes . Merv Hughes said the Phillip Hughes death was as sombre and sad a time he's experienced, 'I can’t remember anything like it in any sport, to be honest'. Phillip Hughes was brought into the Australian Test team by the selection panel which included Merv Hughes . Phillip Hughes in typical attacking style against Sri Lanka in last season's third test at the SCG . Phillip Hughes salutes the crowd after scoring a century during the third cricket test against Sri Lanka in Colombo in September of 2011 . Hughes, 53, is recognised one of Australia's all-time great fast bowlers. A colourful character who played 53 Tests for Australia and claimed 212 wickets during a 10-year international career. Merv Hughes was a renowned personality of the game with as much a combative streak on the pitch as a soft heart he showed off it - and while he feels the gladiatorial nature will return to the Test arena, he's unsure when that will happen. 'It is a part of the great game and again it’s going to affect people it in different ways and certainly time will tell but it’s hard to imagine that bowlers, over time, aren’t going to resort to the bouncer,' he said. 'It’s about taking a wicket and it’s about planting the seed of doubt but by no means, as a bowler, do you think that you’re going to hit someone or hurt someone. 'I’d suggest fast bowlers will be very mindful of the damage they can do.' The man who once famously knocked the cap of West Indies legend Sir Vivian Richards during a Test match in the Caribbean added: 'As a fast bowler we are not trying to hit a batsman or hurt a batsman, we’re trying to take wickets so when you bowl a bouncer you are looking for a glove through to the wicket-keeper or possibly a catch down at deep square leg or deep fine leg, so it’s not about hitting batsmen it’s about taking their wicket.' 'Certainly it going to be in the back of people’s minds for a little while everyone is going to be different so it’s a case of seeing what comes of it,' he said. Of the bouncer, Merv Hughe said: 'It’s about taking a wicket and it’s about planting the seed of doubt but by no means, as a bowler, do you think that you’re going to hit someone or hurt someone.' Merv Hughes knocks Viv Richards' cap off his head with a bouncer during an Australia v West Indies test match in 1991 . 63 not out. Phillip Hughes in dashing action during his final innings for South Australia versus NSW . Merv Hughes thoughts turned to Sean Abbott: 'My heart goes out to him, a young man early in his career, a promising young bowler.' 'Again I have met him a couple of times, I don’t know him all that well but I couldn’t even begin to imagine how he’s feeling or what he’s going through. 'It’s up to the individual and possibly time, you hope that he (Abbott) doesn’t hold himself to blame because it was just a tragic incident. 'Many bowlers have run in, over time, bowling short balls at batsmen and have hit batsmen and been worried about it. It’s very, very, tough for him - there’s no doubt about that - I can’t even begin to imagine.' 'My heart goes out to him, a young man early in his career, a promising young bowler,' Merv Hughes said of Sean Abbott. 'You hope that he doesn’t hold himself to blame because it was just a tragic incident.' He told Daily Mail Australia that 'there has not been a more sad and sombre time'. 'When Phil Hughes got hit last week, you know that it was going to be fairly critical when three games of cricket are called off as a result. 'Since his passing on Thursday just the outpouring of grief and feeling of sadness, I can’t remember anything like it in any sport, to be honest. 'Just a young man taken so tragically, obviously he had a big future – to have played 26 test matches at the age of 25, to have accomplished what he had accomplished he was a very promising player and certainly the Australian selectors invested a fair bit of time on him and the view was that he was going to play a very big part in the cricket going forward.' Merv Hughes has turned his hand to writing and acting in his post-cricket career . Post-retirement Merv Hughes played his part as an Australian selector and was part of the panel which brought Phillip Hughes into the international fold. Since then he has turned his hand variously to writing, including his new book 'Merv Hughes' 104 Cricket Legends', as well as some acting and television work. 'I’ve made a living out of cricket and while I haven’t played for 20 years – you can go deep into it and cricket has given me the life I’ve got,' Merv Hughes said. 'I’m the first to put my hand up and say I was very fortunate with the way that I was seen as a cricketer and to go out and about now and be recognised is great.' December 14, 2012.

"He was just a baby when his father was shot dead - a few days before they would have met. Now brave Ashton Sexton-Farquhar has paid tribute to the soldier he never saw, laying a poppy wreath in his honour on Remembrance Sunday. Ashton, now four, made the heart-rending public gesture in Colchester, Essex. Scroll down for video . Heart-rending: Ashton Sexton-Farquhar was just five months old when his father was shot and killed by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. Today he led tributes in Colchester, Essex, by laying a poppy wreath in his honour . Ashton, now four years old, said at the public remembrance event: 'I am very proud of my daddy. He's my hero' His father Shaun Sexton, a former platoon sergeant with the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, died in 2010 when Ashton was just five months old. He had spent 14 years as a Paratrooper, serving in Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, before leaving to join a private security firm protecting U.S. aid workers. The 30-year-old went away on training exercises before being deployed by the firm to the northern Afghan town of Kunduz. He was just a few days from coming home when he was shot and killed by elite Taliban troops who stormed the compound where he was staying. Stoic: The four-year-old's mother Trudy (right) said he often asks questions about his late father . Proud: The four-year-old with a photograph of his father, who was days away from meeting him when he died . His son wore a suit and tie with a poppy today at the Colchester war memorial, on what would have been Mr Sexton's 35th birthday. Thousands of members of the public stood 20-deep for the two-minute silence at 11am, one of hundreds across the country which were led by the Queen at the Cenotaph in Whitehall. The four-year-old laid a wreath and placed a small cross in the soil, saying: 'I am very proud of my daddy - he's my hero.' Ashton's mother Trudy Farquhar, 37, with whom he lives in Colchester, said: 'Ashton sees dads in uniform picking up their children from school, and that is particularly hard as he knows his dad is not coming home. 'When we walk past the war memorial he says to me: ""Am I going to put my daddy's poppies down there?"" which is heart-breaking.' Bedecked in medals like the veterans beside him, Ashton joined his mother at the service in Colchester . Miss Farquhar previously had two military deaths in her family. She lost her father Danny Farquhar, who served with the Royal Artillery, on a training exercise in 1982 when she was five years old. And her cousin, 20-year-old Jamie Janes, was killed by an IED in Helmand province in 2009 - making headlines when Gordon Brown mis-spelt his mother's name in a poorly-written condolence letter. Mother-of-five Miss Farquhar added: 'It's like history repeating itself in terms of what happened to me with my dad and now Ashton and his dad. 'I don't know anything about my dad and his time in the military because when I was growing up, he was never talked about. 'I am making sure that it is not going to be like that for Ashton and tell him lots of stories about his dad and his nan does the same thing too.

"'Never stopped trying': Capt Shepard . A Royal Marine has been awarded one of Britain’s highest bravery awards after making a desperate attempt to save his best friend during a diving exercise. Captain Samuel Shephard is to receive the George Cross for his heroic efforts to recover fellow Marine, Lieutenant Damien Moran, 23, who suffered an embolism and sank 200ft to the seabed off Egypt in August last year. Capt Shephard repeatedly dived alone and without oxygen for 25 minutes in a bid to locate his comrade. Hopes were raised when an instructor equipped with oxygen tanks arrived at the scene, but he ruled out a search on safety grounds. Capt Shephard ignored his warnings, strapped on the equipment and dived again. As the medal citation reads: ‘At 1700 hours, in fading light and tired after six hours in the water, the pair [Capt Shephard and Lieut Moran] were snorkelling with four others… The other diver briefly surfaced with the others, lost consciousness, and sank rapidly. ‘A qualified and equipped diving instructor judged it too dark, deep and dangerous to mount a rescue. But without hesitation Shephard disregarded the instructor’s advice… . ‘Following a series of dives that day, he knew the risk of decompression sickness, paralysis or even death was significant… Disorientated, in almost complete darkness, and with a perforated eardrum, he located the casualty suspended upside-down. His dive watch recorded a depth over 60 metres … Placing himself at even greater risk, he removed his mask to give the lifeless diver two rescue breaths.’ Capt Shephard carried his friend over a coral bank ‘in bloodied feet’ to get him to hospital, but Lieut Moran was pronounced dead on arrival. The pair had just completed a four-month tour of Afghanistan before relocating to Egypt for diving training. Last night, Lieut Moran’s mother Gerta paid tribute to her son’s friend: ‘I am extremely grateful for what Sam did. He never stopped trying.’ The GC is the top bravery award for civilians, as well as military personnel whose actions would not normally be eligible to receive gallantry medals.

"Disgraced England hooker Josh Hodgson could face the exit door after smashing through one during a drunken night out. YouTube footage showed Hodgson, who will play in the NRL next season with the Canberra Raiders, demolishing the door with a shoulder charge during a party at a Dunedin student flat. The incident occurred after his side’s 16-14 loss to New Zealand in the Four Nations on Saturday at Forsyth Barr Stadium. Hodgson may have proved adept at making new friends by breaking down barriers, but he will now be disciplined by England for the incident. Scroll down for video . England's Josh Hodgson shows the power that helped him smash through a door at a student party in Dunedin . As well as breaking through the door, Hodgson, 25, had earlier broken into the England team, winning his first two caps against Samoa and Australia in the competition. However, he had been dropped for England’s final match against New Zealand and replaced by Catalans’ Elliott Whitehead. The short YouTube clip shows the former Hull KR forward crashing through a door inside the flat to chants of “go through the door” from party-goers. A student in the flat, who did not wish to be named, told Fairfax Media that most of the squad had come to the address near the hotel where the English team was staying for a party on Saturday night. She said 'definitely like 15-20 people' arrived around 4.30am on Sunday morning and didn't leave until 8.30am. England management replaced the door and team manager Jon Roberts apologised in a statement. 'We were made aware of an incident that occurred last night around lunchtime today,' he said. 'It is being dealt with internally with the person involved, and they will be disciplined.' Hodgson may also be in more hot water when he joins up with his new NRL side, Canberra Raiders, later this month. He has signed a two-year contract with the NRL side and the Raiders released a statement saying they had 'been made aware of the incident'. Raiders chief executive Don Furner said he had been in communication with Hodgson. 'Josh has said that he is embarrassed by what he has done and he will be spoken to further when he arrives at club headquarters because that sort of behaviour is unacceptable at the Raiders,' Furner said. The England hooker is set to be disciplined by England over the incident . England players had been given permission to go out on the town after their 14-16 loss to the Kiwis on Saturday night. 'On behalf of England Rugby League, we apologise for the behaviour and have arranged for the repair of the small amount of damage,' Roberts said. 'We have had a great time in Dunedin and the city has made us welcome. Last night's match was a great spectacle for International Rugby League and we look forward to returning to the city in the future.​' Hodgson was encouraged on with chants of 'go through the door' by partygoers . Team media manager Danny Reuben said the team had not been drinking in Dunedin during the week, referring to a Fairfax Media story about the team being shocked by the high level of student drinking in the city.","England star Hodgson smashes through a door on drunken night out .

"The family of a five-year-old girl who was shot dead while sitting on her grandfather's lap have donated her heart to save the life of another child. Laylah Petersen was killed when a dozen bullets were fired at her Milwaukee home. One entered through the wall and hit her in the head while she sat on the couch. Investigators said there was no clear motive for the shooting and they needed the public's help to find those responsible. During an emotional press conference, Police Chief Edward Flynn said he would keep a photo of the victim in his chest pocket, next to the photos of his own grandchildren, until suspects are arrested. Tragic: Laylah Petersen, five, was shot and killed Thursday when two gunmen opened fire on her Milwaukee home as she sat on her grandfather's lap . Helping save a life: Her family have announced that her heart is being donated so another child has the chance to survive . 'She is going to be in our hearts, like her little baby heart is going to be in somebody else's,' he said. 'We know that as awful as this event has been, she is going to live on and save a life.' No arrests have been made in the Thursday evening shooting. Investigators have said they don't believe anyone in the home, where Laylah was being raised by her grandparents, was being targeted. Flynn said officers were getting good tips and canvassing the neighborhood for witnesses. He urged anyone with possible information to come forward, saying 'at this point, rumors are as helpful as facts.' He said the house may have been mistakenly targeted, but that several theories were being explored. Without elaborating, he said investigators were having some success with physical evidence and were 'in a different place today than we were yesterday.' Police have said officers found a dozen casings at the scene, and were looking into whether more than one handgun was used. Emotional: Laylah's aunt Amanda Legler, Ashley Fogl and her grandmother Judy Hazard hug officers who were first to arrive at the scene of the deadly attack . United: (from left to right) Robert Petersen, father of Laylah Petersen,  aunt Tracy Martinez, grandmother Judy Hazard, and aunt Amanda Legler listen to officers speak . Message: During the conference family spokesman Richard Schwoegler III said Laylah's heart had been donated and urged faith-based organizations to take to the streets to build relationships with troubled people . The chief said his officers 'are not going to rest until we find the perpetrators of this vicious crime to justice.' Laylah's relatives tearfully hugged officers during Saturday's news conference, and her aunt, Tracy Martinez, said family was especially grateful to the first officers on the scene. Family spokesman Richard Schwoegler III said Laylah's heart had been donated. He also urged faith-based organizations to take to the streets in an effort build relationships with troubled people. Flynn said so far 11 children under the age of 13 have been shot this year in Milwaukee, compared to two last year. A funeral is planned for Wednesday. A reward of up to $5,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. Father: Laylah's father, Robert Petersen, said he was trying to better himself so he could give his children, who were being raised by their grandparents at the time, the life they deserved . Aunt: Amanda Legler, Laylah's aunt, spoke through tears in front of the Milwaukee home and demanded justice for her slain niece . Police said officers had no previous calls to the home, and they don't believe anyone living there was targeted. 'We believe that this bullet read, 'To whom it may concern.' And that concerns all of us, and that should concern everybody in our community,' Capt. Aaron Raap said during a news conference on Friday. 'If you saw something, say something. If you hear something, say something.' Raap said initial descriptions of the shootings as being 'targeted' referred to the fact that all 12 bullets fired hit the house. Officers found a dozen casings at the scene, and were looking into whether more than one handgun was used. They also were interviewing witnesses and seeking any possible surveillance video. Rapp said in a conference on Friday that investigators are 'vigorously following up on leads' but officials are 'befuddled' as to the motive behind the crime, according to Fox6Now. Police Chief Edward Flynn said two young children were being raised by their grandparents in the house, where people left flowers, toys and other items in a makeshift memorial for the little girl Friday. 'This is a stable, loving, working family in a stable working-class neighborhood where everybody is trying to do the right thing,' Flynn said. Wild Child: Legler said that Laylah was a 'wild child,' 'full of life, and the 'happiest child you'll ever meet' Vigil: A Facebook page indicates that a candlelight vigil will be held for the child Sunday . In an interview with Fox, Laylah's father, Robert Petersen, said his daughter was his 'whole life' and described her as 'the sweetest little girl, so smart and so beautiful.' 'I've never felt this pain in my life,' Petersen said. 'All I've been trying to do is better myself so one day I can take [my children] and give them the life that they deserve.' The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. 'There is no reason conceivable that I can think of that would explain this wanton, violent act,' Flynn told reporters Thursday night. 'We are going to find (the shooters). We are going to arrest them. And they are going to jail.' Shots: Twelve shots burst through the home Thursday at 6pm and one of the bullets pierced a wall then struck the five-year-old in the head . Reward: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case of the shooting that took place in the child's Milwaukee home (above) Laylah's aunt Amanda Legler, spoke in front of the home saying that Laylah was a 'wild child' and 'full of life.' 'Just last week we went trick-or-treating and she told me Ti-Ti Manna, I love you more than science,' Lelger told the Journal Sentinel. 'That was just Laylah, she was so bizarre and so cute. She was just the happiest child you'll ever meet.' A Facebook page indicates that a candlelight vigil will be held for the girl on Sunday. Laylah is the third child under age 13 whose death was considered a homicide this year in Milwaukee, Lt. Mark Stanmeyer said. But the city has seen fewer homicides this year than last, 76 compared to 93 at the same time in 2013. At this point last year, four children under 13 had been killed.

"Richard Bowler, 35, has been jailed for five years after he was convicted of Alun Williams' manslaughter by gross negligence . A disabled man has been found guilty of killing a chef who died after he was wrapped in clingfilm and PVC during a sex game. P&O head chef Alun Williams, 47, suffered a heart attack after allegedly asking to be hooded and swathed from head to toe in plastic sheeting. Richard Bowler, 35, was today jailed for five years after he was convicted of Mr Williams' manslaughter by gross negligence while his co-defendant, David Connor, 23, was cleared of the same charge. Canterbury Crown Court heard Mr Williams  - who had an interest in mummification and bondage - arrived at the flat where Bowler and Connor lived in Dover, Kent, after he exchanged text messages with Bowler. A jury heard that the chef would often meet men online for sex. The trial at Canterbury Crown Court was told that Bowler suffers from cerebral palsy, and Connor was his informal carer. Connor told the police that he left the flat after Bowler told him he had a man coming round for a sex session, the jury heard. He said he returned at 1am last August 20 and that Bowler told him that Mr Williams had wanted to be wrapped in clingfilm. Just before 6am, Bowler dialled the emergency services, telling them Mr Williams had stopped breathing after they had indulged in a 'kinky sex game'. Bowler is said to have cut open the clingfilm and plastic sheeting before performing CPR on Mr Williams, who lived with his girlfriend. Bowler told the operator: 'It's a bit embarrassing. It's my friend, he's called Alun. I have known him for five years. I'm gay, he's gay.' Connor could be heard in the background as Bowler added: 'We had a bit of a kinky sex game and he's stopped breathing.' Bowler also told the operator: 'I thought he was just sleeping. I am sorry, I should have called before. He takes ketamine and that mongs him out.' He went on: 'He's on my bed, he's wrapped in a PVC sheet with tape and that. He's got clingfilm wrapped around his body and I have got a text message on my phone stating that's what he likes.' P&O head chef Alun Williams, 47, suffered a heart attack after allegedly asking to be hooded and swathed from head to toe in plastic sheeting. A photo of a mock-up show to jurors . Richard Bowler, 35, arrives at Canterbury Crown Court in Kent. Bowler is said to have cut open the clingfilm and plastic sheeting before performing CPR on Mr Williams, who lived with his girlfriend . Bowler's co-defendant, David Connor, 23, was cleared of the same charge. The court heard that sexual acts had taken place between the three men . Mr Williams was found wrapped tightly from head to toe in the clingfilm and plastic sheeting, with just enough space left around his nose and mouth so he could breathe. The court heard that sexual acts had taken place between the three men. A post-mortem examination found Mr Williams died following body wrapping while under the influence of drugs. Shortly after 6am that morning, Connor walked into the taxi rank where his mother worked and said 'Mum, Richard's killed someone', the court was told. Prosecutor Ian Hope said police found substances including ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and amyl nitrate, also known as poppers, in Mr Williams' rucksack. They also found a gas mask and ties in his bag. Sex toys, masking tape, duct tape, black plastic sheeting and clingfilm were also found in the flat, the jury heard. A post-mortem examination found Mr Williams (pictured) died following body wrapping while under the influence of drugs . Police and Forensic officers outside the flat in  Dover where  Alun Williams was found dead . Bowler and Connor had denied a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. Following around four hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Bowler and cleared Connor. Bowler's defence was that he took all reasonable care for Mr Williams. It was said on his behalf that he could not have foreseen that wrapping Mr Williams up in clingfilm and PVC would have led to his death. Connor claimed that he only acted on the instructions of Mr Williams and Bowler and could not have foreseen his death. Part-way through the trial, Judge Adele Williams ruled that a charge of manslaughter against both men be dropped. Detective Inspector Richard Vickery, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said following the case: 'This is a tragic death of a man well-liked by his colleagues and friends. 'Bowler had a responsibility to look after the welfare of Mr Williams when he entered their home and spent the evening with him. Due to the nature in which he was restrained he should never have left him alone for extended periods of time - but he did. 'I'm pleased the courts have recognised this responsibility and found him guilty of manslaughter. I hope this verdict and sentence goes some way to providing those who were close to Mr Williams some closure after what has been a very difficult time.'","P&O head chef Alun Williams, 47, suffered a heart attack in the sex game .

"Getting a flat tyre and not having a spare would leave most motorists stranded. But for Russian motorist Bogdan Evseyev, getting a wheel puncture proved no problem. That's because the innovative 43-year-old removed the whole wheel and replaced it using a sledge. Scroll down for video . Russian motorist Bogdan Evseyev replaced his flat car tyre with a sledge that he had in the boot of his car . Mr Evseyev used the sledge, which belonged to his son as he didn't have a spare tyre and didn't want to be stranded . Mr Evseyev came to a stop while driving his car after suffering from a flat tyre and not having a spare to replace it. Knowing that it would have left him stranded, he remembered he still had his son's sledge in the boot. He then simply removed the flat tyre and wedged the sledge underneath the wheel axle. And this then allowed him to try the short distance over the snow and ice-covered roads to the tyre repair garage at his home in the town of Belovo in southern Russia's Kemerovo Oblast region. Eyewitness Nestor Ulyanov saw Mr Evseyev carry out the makeshift repair and filmed the car driving across the ice. He then uploaded the video to social media together with the message, 'Never underestimate a Russian, we always come out winners.' Eyewitness Nestor Ulyanov saw the driver remove the tyre and wedge the sledge under the wheel axle . Mr Ulyanov took a video of the makeshift repair and uploaded it to the internet with the message, 'Never underestimate a Russian, we always come out winners' But Mr Ulyanov, 38, explained that although he expected the plan to backfire, the stunt worked really well. He explained: 'We videoed it for a short time using my mobile phone, and then we saw him pull over to the garage at the side of the road. 'I stopped to tell them that I thought it was really hilarious. I had a chat with the car driver, I told him I was going to put the video online. 'The sledge once they got it out from underneath was surprisingly undamaged, apart from having a few smudges of oil. 'But I reckon even buying a new one is still going to be cheaper than a tow truck - and probably quicker.'","Russian driver Bogdan Evseyev became stuck when he suffered a flat tyre .

"A schoolboy has died after suffering an asthma attack 15 minutes into football practice. Ten-year-old Cameron Good, from Hardane, East Yorkshire, was training with his club AFC Kingston Panthers when he began to struggle to breathe. The schoolboy fell into a coma after suffering a massive asthma attack and never regained consciousness. Four days later, after a brain scan revealed huge damage, his parents Stacy Suddaby and Craig Good agreed for his life support machine to be turned off. Miss Suddaby, 29, said: 'When asthma strikes, it doesn't mess around. It killed our son within 15 minutes. Cameron Good, 10, collapsed and fell into a coma after suffering a massive asthma attack while football training. Four days later his parents made the devastating decision to switch off his life support machine. 'People underestimate this condition. When people think of asthma they just think of a little blue inhaler, but it can kill.' Cameron, who lived with his mother in Hardane, Hull, East Yorkshire, was a Year 5 pupil at the estate's St Anthony's Catholic Primary School. Keen footballer Cameron was diagnosed with asthma when he was two, but doctors had reassured his parents it was safe for him to play sport. Miss Suddaby said her son had seemed in good health when she had taken him to his weekly football practice,  at 5.50pm on Wednesday, November 26. 'Cameron had been fine all day,' she said. 'He had not been wheezing. There was nothing to suggest anything was wrong. 'He was faffing about with his football boots when we got there, before going outside with the others. Me and the other parents were sitting inside, while the boys trained. 'About 15 minutes later, Cameron's coach brought him in and said Cameron was struggling to breathe.' His parents now want to raise awareness of the condition, which kills three people a day in the UK. Miss Suddaby, who is separated from her son's father, says she asked her son's coach how many times her son had used his inhaler. 'Cameron had only had four pumps of the inhaler,' she said. 'The advice parents get is call 999 if they have had ten pumps, or if they have lost consciousness. 'He was still conscious at this point. I made sure he had ten pumps. 'Cameron told me, ""Mam, I need an ambulance. I can't breathe"". Cameron, from Hardane, East Yorkshire, was training with his club AFC Kingston Panthers at Kingswood Academy in Bransholme (pictured) when he began to struggle to breathe. He fell unconscious after suffering an asthma attack and never came to . 'He'd had attacks and panicked before, but he'd never asked for an ambulance. He was begging me. He was going white. 'Someone called an ambulance. A few minutes later, Cameron turned blue. He then lost consciousness and never came around.' Two of the other mothers attempted CPR while waiting for paramedics, but Miss Suddaby said it took 13 minutes for the ambulance to arrive, because of heavy commuter traffic. 'I was trying to stay calm,' she said. 'I was talking to him. I didn't know if he could still hear me. I didn't want to panic him.' Paramedics were helped by a consultant anaesthetist who had been having a guitar lesson at the school. Cameron's heart was restarted on the way to Hull Royal Infirmary. He was then transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at Leeds General Infirmary during the early hours. Miss Suddaby said: 'A scan showed extensive brain damage. 'We were told if, by some slim chance, he woke up from the coma, he would not be able to do anything by himself.' Miss Suddaby said she and Mr Good had a horrific decision to make. 'Agreeing to turn off a life support machine is the worst decision any parent has to make,' she said. 'We wanted him to be that miracle boy. I wanted newspapers knocking on the door because he had made a miraculous recovery.' Cameron died on Sunday, November 30. Leading tributes to her son, Miss Suddaby said: 'Cameron was a proper little mammy's boy.' Mr Good, 36, said: 'Cameron was so funny. He was an amazing boy and I was so proud of him.'","Cameron Good was at a training session with AFC Kingston Panthers .

"The luxurious Beverly Hills Hotel, a favored haunt for Hollywood A-listers, is being deserted as celebrities join a boycott of it over the anti-gay laws of the hotel's owner. In the past week, at least 20 events have been canceled at the historic hotel, and stars including Jay Leno have taken part in protests outside the pink stucco building. The boycott is in response to the Sultan of Brunei's decision to impose sharia, which would make it legal for homosexuals who live in his kingdom to be stoned. Scroll down for video . Boycott: Talk show host Jay Leno joins a protest against the Sultan of Brunei outside the Beverly Hills Hotel . Taking a stand: Leno had been due to chair a women's event at the luxury hotel but canceled when its owner imposed sharia in Brunei . The Sultan heads the Dorchester Collection, which runs a chain of opulent hotels around the world. His decision to impose sharia - Islamic law - on the tiny Asian state he governs has prompted a high-level backlash in the West. From talk show host Ellen to billionaire Richard Branson, high-profile names have been joining the call to boycott hotels owned by the Sultan. Ellen went public with her decision to boycott the hotel on April 22, sending a tweet that read: 'I won't be visiting the Hotel Bel-Air or the Beverly Hills Hotel until this is resolved.' Her tweet, which included a second Dorchester Collection hotel, came on the day the Sultan announced that anyone in Brunei found guilty of homosexuality, adultery or blasphemy would be stoned to death. As stars brought attention to the harsh penalties, the Beverly Hills began to lose business, with high-profile events canceled in a move that the Wall Street Journal estimates has cost the hotel $2 million. Empty: The Beverly Hills hotel has lost an estimated $2 million in business in the past week and its usually star-filled Polo Lounge was deserted on Thursday lunchtime . Luxury: The historic Beverly Hills Hotel has long been a favored haunt of A-list celebrities . Abuse: The Sultan of Brunei has imposed sharia, making homosexuality and adultery punishable by stoning . Talk show host Jay Leno had been due to chair an event at the hotel for the Global Women's Rights awards, but instead joined a protest line outside. 'What year is it, 1814? Come on people, it's 2014,' he said. 'You know evil flourishes when good people do nothing.' His sentiment was echoed by British entrepreneur Branson, who said that none of his family members or Virgin employees would stay at a Dorchester hotel 'until the Sultan abides by basic human rights'. On Thursday a couple of writers from The Hollywood Reporter booked a lunch at the hotel, which is famous for being the place where A-listers such as Tom Cruise meet to do movie business. The usually bustling Polo Lounge was distinctly empty and, when pressed by the slow lunch trade, a waiter confessed: 'Yes, it’s been quiet these past few days.' While star sightings would usually be high at the famed hotel, the writers spotted only one - Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel. Show of support: Ellen, Patrick Stewart and British entrepreneur Richard Branson have all joined the boycott . But, when they asked his agent about the actor's presence, they were told the London-based star had been in Beverly Hills on business, knew nothing of the boycott and 'has no intention of going back there'. Events including a Night Before the Oscars fundraiser and Women in Entertainment breakfast have been moved from the hotel. The head of a teen support group, which was due to host a partt for 500 this week, also switched locations because of the boycott. 'When we heard what was going on in Brunei, we said that doesn't fit with our philosophy, Elaine Leader, from the group, said. Widespread: As details of the Sultan's spread, the boycott of the Beverly Hills Hotel spread to other Dorchester Collection hotels, and more stars joined the protest . Campaign: Beverly Hills mayor Lili Bosse speaks at a city council meeting about plans to pressure the Sultan to give up the hotel . The city mayor, Lili Bosse, has also said that she would steer clear of the hotel, adding: 'The city and the hotel have grown up together ... [but the Brunei laws are] a horrific violation of basic human rights.' At a meeting earlier this week, the Beverly Hills City council approved a resolution that condemned the Sultan's rule sand urged him to sell the hotel. Chief executive for the Dorchester group, Christopher Cowdray, flew to Los Angeles from London this week to try to restore confidence in the brand. He highlighted how the group was a big employer in the region and 'abides by the laws of the countries in which we operate'. He said it was unlikely that the Sultan-owned group would sell off its investments in the area.","Hotel favored by A-list celebs loses $2 million in business over protest .

"Two teenage girls who were attacked with battery acid in Zanzibar should return to the country to help with the police investigation, detectives have said. Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee were left badly injured after two men on a moped threw acid at them while they walked to dinner. The two friends, who were volunteering on the Indian Ocean island of Zanzibar, are now back in the UK and will undergo skin grafts. Injured: Kirstie Trup, left, and Katie Gee, both 18, had acid thrown in their faces during an attack in Zanzibar. Police may ask them to return to the tropical island to help convict any potential suspects . Recovering: Katie Gee, right, and Kirstie Trup , left, are now back in the UK and will undergo skin grafts to repair the damage . But it emerged today that police officers tracking the men on the tropical island may ask the girls to return to help convict any potential suspects. Police have been given hope after the two friends said they would be able to identify their attackers if they saw them again. Mussa Ali Mussa, Zanzibar’s commissioner of police, said the girls could help with identification of suspects or any future trial. Speaking to the Evening Standard, he . said: 'It will depend on the circumstances of the investigation (but) yes, we shall ask them. We shall contact the UK authorities.' Miss Gee, from Hampstead in London, . suffered burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per cent of her . torso. Miss Trup, from East Finchley, London, was less seriously injured . after jumping into the sea to wash off the acid. Miss . Gee had an operation yesterday in the Chelsea & Westminster . hospital while Miss Trup will return for a skin graft on Thursday. Attack: Two men on a moped hurled acid in the . girls' faces as they walked to meet friends for dinner in Stone Town, . Zanzibar (seen in a file photo) Help: After they were attacked by the two men the girls ran to the Tembo Hotel, pictured . The family of Katie have said they want her to recover from her injuries before they consider returning to Zanzibar. Speaking to the Evening Standard, Doug Morris, boyfriend of Katie Gee’s mother Nicky, 45, said:  She is not in the condition to travel, and the family’s primary concern is her recovery.' Painful: This photograph released by the teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack . Katie's mother Nicky told this week how she was struggling to come to terms with why someone could do ‘something so evil’. Mrs Gee told BBC News: ‘This whole thing is unexplained. It's difficult to think of someone doing something so evil. This is an extremely long journey. It's very, very sensitive.’ The pair were attacked by two men on a moped in Zanzibar City. They were flown to hospital in Dar es Salaam in mainland Tanzania, then on to London. Zanzibar’s police have said a third British woman was sent threats apparently from the same attackers. The unnamed 29-year-old insisted she would not stop her charity work on the island. Members of both teenagers' families have been keeping a bedside vigil after the pair were flown home and immediately sent to London's regional burns centre. Katie has already taken to Twitter to thank well-wishers for their support, while a photograph released by the teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack. The women were enjoying the last week of a trip as volunteer teachers to the predominantly Muslim island when the corrosive substance was thrown at them in an apparently unprovoked attack. They had originally planned to return in time to collect their A-level results this week, with Kirstie hoping to study history at the University of Bristol while Katie is considering the University of Leeds.","Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee badly injured after two men threw acid at them .

"Unsettling video footage has given the first look into the massive sinkhole that opened up beneath a Florida home and swallowed a man from his bed in February. Jeff Bush, 37, was sucked into the sinkhole while he slept in his family home in Seffner and when his brother, Jeremy, jumped in the hole to try to save him, he was nowhere to be seen. Footage taken by a contractor who examined the hole shortly before the home was demolished has now been released by the county, and shows that every piece of furniture has vanished. Most bizarre is how the ground has completely given way - revealing the brown dirt beneath - yet hats, high-visibility jackets and shelves remain on the wall above where Bush's bed once was. Scroll down for video . Frightening: A bird's eye view shot shows the sinkhole which swallowed Jeff Bush from his bed in February . A day after the accident, authorities stopped their search for Bush as tests showed no sign of life in the hole. The house has now been torn down and the family hopes to set up a memorial at the site. Neighbours left their properties and the county has said that the houses on each side of the sinkhole house will have to be condemned, Fox News reported. 'The results of the geophysical tests concluded that the subsurface soils were unstable as subsidence activity is evidenced at each site,' County Administrator Michael Merrill said. He added that residents should speak with engineers before they try to collect their belongings. Bizarre: Hats are still hanging on a doorknob in the bedroom in Seffner, Florida yet the ground beneath the wall has completely vanished. The freak accident claimed the life of 37-year-old Jeff Bush, right . Gone: This video still shows the hanging hats, left, above the massive hole in the ground. The video was taken by a contractor shortly before the home was demolished . Bush, 37, was in his bedroom in Seffner - a suburb of 8,000 people 15 miles east of downtown . Tampa - when the earth opened up on the night of February 28. Five others in the house escaped unharmed. Jeremy . Bush, 36, recalled how he desperately tried to pull his brother, Jeff, from the rubble . as he heard his screams for help. 'I ran in there and heard somebody screaming, my brother screaming, and I ran in there,' he told My Fox Tampa Bay . 'And . all I see is this big hole. All I see is the top of his bed. I didn't . see anything else, so I jumped in the hole and tried getting him out. Hidden: The hole was largely hidden beneath the home but was seen as the property was demolished . Crushed: Demolition experts watched as the Bush's home was destroyed three days after his death . 'The . floor was still giving in and the dirt was still going down, but I . didn't care. I wanted to save my brother. I could hear him screaming for . me, hollering for . me. I couldn't do nothing.' Jeremy had tried to save his brother . when he heard him screaming, but was unable to reach him. A deputy . pulled Jeremy out of the sinkhole, and likely saved his life. Following the tragedy, Jeremy Bush said he believed the rescue teams should not have given up so soon. 'I feel like they could . have tried harder to get my brother out of there,' he said. 'That was my . brother. No one is even talking about what my mom and dad are going . through. They don't want to be on camera. My mom and dad are going . through hell right now.' Break down: Jeremy Bush, right, told reporters that not enough was done to get his brother Jeff out of a sinkhole during an emotional interview as the family house was demolished . Remembered: Jeremy Bush set up a makeshift memorial for his brother before demolition began . The 20-foot-wide opening of the sinkhole was almost covered by the . house, and rescuers said there were no signs of life after the hole . opened. Experts say thousands of sinkholes . erupt yearly in Florida because of the state's unique geography, though . most are small and deaths rarely occur. 'There's hardly a place in Florida . that's immune to sinkholes,' said Sandy Nettles, who owns a geology . consulting company. 'There's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole . is going to occur.' Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . A sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities. When this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, . and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion. Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way. According . to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, . Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by . sinkholes. While they often . occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by . human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely . culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed. Source: USGS .","Jeff Bush, 37, was sucked into the hole under his home in February .

"The Navy SEAL who claims he killed Osama bin Laden says he shot the terrorist a third time 'just for luck.' Robert O'Neill, who was unmasked last week by MailOnline as 'The Shooter', had been trained to use two head shots during missions - known in military circles as a double tap. However, according to the New York Post, he told families of 9/11 victims there was 'no harm in putting one more bullet in him.' Scroll down for video . What's done is done: Bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill (above) said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure' Under fire: This comes as many are attacking O'Neill for making his identity as a Navy SEAL public . According to the paper, he made the comments during a secret meeting at the memorial museum at the World Trade Center site in July. Describing the night of the raid, he said that he didn't know who 'The Target' was going into the mission. Before his unit set off, he had time to make one, last phone call to his children, fearing he may never see them again. He recalled how he climbed into bin Laden's compound, walked upstairs and heard. His weapon then went: 'Pop! Pop! Pop!' The audience, all relatives of people who died in the attacks on the Twin Towers had no idea they would be receiving a first hand account of how the mastermind was killed. Initially they were invited to a 'private and confidential' event that included a talk by a 'mystery speaker'. Last week, following his first televised interview, he said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure.' Down: O'Neill says of what happened, that anyone who questions him can only ask one other person what really happened, Osama bin Laden (above), and he's dead . O'Neill  opened up about his meeting with the relatives of the 9/11 terror attacks saying: '[O]ne thing I tell them is all right, Osama bin Laden died like a p****.That's all I'm telling you. Just so you know.' This was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews O'Neill had with journalist Alex Quade that were aired on Friday's AC360. He added that it doesn't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist. 'The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am The Shooter,' O'Neill said. 'Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.' Site: O'Neill also revealed that he and his fellow Navy SEALs did not think they would return alive after the raid on bin Laden's hideout (above) He also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow SEALs did not think they would make it out alive after raiding bin Laden's hideout. 'Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,' O'Neill said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them. '(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.' O'Neill's move to go public has been met with mixed response, and heavily criticzed among his fellow SEALs. He sees it differently however, pointing out how films like Captain Phillips and Zero Dark Thirty both made his work very public, and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents. 'Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,' he said. 'I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.' Public guy: O'Neill seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews, saying he doesn't care if people think he is 'full of s***' As for those who question him, he is not letting it bother him. 'Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,' he said. 'You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.' O'Neill is due to appear in a two-part documentary on Fox News next week, detailing his part in the killing of bin Laden. MailOnline exclusively disclosed his identity ahead of the broadcast. O’Neill has already described the night of May 2, 2011 in an interview with Sharon Stone’s ex-husband Phil Bronstein that appeared in Esquire magazine in February 2013. But his name was not revealed at that time and he was referred to only as ‘the Shooter.’ Now his identity has become public, military leaders and fellow SEALs are lining up to discredit his version of events. Donation: O'Neill gave his SEAL team uniform the museum at the memorial to the September 11 terror attacks in New York after meeting relatives of the victims of bin Laden's atrocity. It was then that he decided to tell the wider public that he was 'The Shooter' Speaking success: O'Neill is now a high-profile member of the motivational speaking circuit, openly revealing that he was a SEAL - but until now not declaring that he was involved in the daring raid which killed bin Laden . A former SEAL Team 6 commander told the New York Times O’Neill only fired ‘insurance shots’ into bin Laden’s twitching body after the terror leader had already been mortally shot by an unidentified SEAL who is still in the service. That hero is described as the ’point man’ who led the SEALs up the stairs in bin Laden’s compound to the bedroom where he was hiding. Another Team 6 member also disputed O’Neill’s version, saying the 'point man' had wounded bin Laden with a shot to the side, and then grabbed the women in the room for fear they were wearing explosives. O’Neill, he said, had then finished Osama off. And Reuters quoted an unidentified source close to a SEAL Team 6 member as saying the fatal shot was fired by one of two other men who entered the room before O'Neill. But O’Neill told Bronstein last year: ‘I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.’ One SEAL source told MailOnline: 'The real shooter would never discuss it publicly. 'Members of SEAL Team Six haven’t discussed it publicly so there’s a reasonable chance he’s not being truthful. 'There is no way O’Neill could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on Osama bin Laden unless his comrades all attested to it. 'But again, the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that.'","The Navy SEAL was unmasked this week by MailOnline as 'The Shooter'

"A Supreme Court judge has ruled that an ICAC inquiry into NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC will go ahead, rejecting a bid by Ms Cunneen, her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilley, to have the corruption hearing thrown out. Justice Clifton Hoeben handed down his decision on Monday afternoon, ruling against Ms Cunneen's contention that the Independent Commission Against Corruption had no right to investigate a 'malicious' complaint which related to her private life. The ICAC has alleged Ms Cunneen and her son counselled Ms Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a car crash in May. In the accident, the Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time and experienced chest pain, fearing that her breast implants may have been ruptured.

The incident is unrelated to a car crash she was involved in which is at the centre of a corruption inquiry invetsigatingMs Tilley, her boyfriend Stephen Wyllie and Mr Wyllie's mother, top prosecutor Margaret Cunneen . Ms Tilley is seen leaving the Downing Centre court on Monday after a magistrate suspended her drive's ;icence for a 'fifth' infringement in the last year. Ms Tilley is is part of the ICAC inquiry into Margaret Cunneen, the mother of her boyfriend, Stephen Wyllie, which will now go ahead following a judge's ruling . Ms Tilley was involved in a car accident in May which is at the centre of the ICAC Inquiry, and appeared in court regarding running a red light in July and a further offence during the Easter weekend . Lost licence: Sophia Tilley, 25 (pictured, above right, with  boyfriend, Stephen Wyllie) appeared in the Downing Centre Local Court on Monday for running a red light in June. Ms Tilley, Mr Wyllie and his mother, the NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, have failed in their challenge to halt a corruption inquiry into the aftermath of a May 31 car accident in which Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's car . News of the failed bid emerged as Ms Tilley had her driver's licence suspended in a Sydney court for a traffic offence. The infringement is unrelated to the incident at the centre of the ICAC probe. Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30. In August, Ms Cunneen faced a private hearing over the allegations. Dawn raids: Two months after the car accident in which Sophia Tilley (pictured, above, with Stephen Wyllie) was driving, ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes . Sophia Tilley departs the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Monday. The 25-year-old property sales assistant, who was appearing on unrelated driving offences, is the woman at the centre of the ICAC probe into crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC, and has had her driver's licence suspended for traffic offences . Lost bid: Margaret Cunneen SC's legal counsel, Arthur Moses SC, leaves the NSW Supreme Court after losing a bid to stop the ICAC holding a corruption inquiry into Ms Cunneen and her private life . Inquiry to proceed: The ICAC Corruption inquiry will investigate the aftermath of a car accident on May 31 when Sophia Tilley (above, left) was trapped inside the Ford Mondeo belonging to Margaret Cunneen (above, right) who is the mother of Ms Tilley's boyfriend, Stephen Wyllie (pictured with Ms Tilley). After the crash, she had trouble breathing and feared her breast implants may have ruptured . On October 29, Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley received a summons to attend a public inquiry into the matter, sparking their court bid to halt the proceedings. Ms Cunneen, who has described the accusations as 'malicious', argued the ICAC was acting beyond its jurisdiction and there was no suggestion the allegations involved her conduct as a crown prosecutor. Last week, the three launched court action to stop the inquiry. A public hearing due to start on Monday was stalled by the 'urgent' court action launched last week. However, Supreme Court Justice Clifton Hoeben, has ruled on Monday afternoon that the ICAC inquiry may go ahead. Knocked back: Top prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen (above) has failed in her bid halt ICAC investigating a what she describes as a 'malicious' personal complaint into her private life . Just hours earlier, Ms Tilley had her driver's licence suspended for a traffic offence after appearing in the Downing Centre Local Court for running a red light in Paddington, in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs in July. A P-plate driver, Ms Tilley has previously pleaded guilty to the traffic light offence, but was appearing in court to appeal the suspension of her licence for another, earlier infringement. Ms Tilley, a property sales assistant, was driving 100km/h in an 80km/h zone on the way to see her mother on the Easter long weekend. Ms Tilley's lawyer, Linda Needham said her client had skidded in running the red light during wet weather and that she could lose her job if stripped of her licence. 'She is a woman of good character and is extremely focused on her career,' she said. But Magistrate Lisa Stapleton said Ms Tilley had a 'very poor' driving record, accruing five offences since renewing her L-plates last year. 'She has a limited history and it is very poor,' she said. Both incidents are unrelated to the accident on May 31, when Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore. After Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt, she telephoned Mr Wyllie and he and his father attended the scene. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident, and a blood test conducted afterwards on her at Royal North Shore Hospital showed no alcohol in her system. However, the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced late last month it was investigating Ms Cunneen, Ms Tilley and Mr Wyllie over a corruption allegation. ICAC contends that Mr Wyllie and Ms Cunneen coached Ms Tilley to tell police she had chest pains to avoid being breath tested. Ms Cunneen will now appeal Justice Hoeben's decision in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal next Tuesday, November 18.

"Cricket Australia has decided to trademark the phrase ‘63 not out’ to prevent people from cashing in on the death of Australian cricketer Philip Hughes. Tributes have flowed for Hughes since his death on November 25 when he was hit in the head by a Sean Abbott bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The batsman will again be in everyone's thoughts as the Boxing Day Test starts in Melbourne today. In what has been an emotional series for the home team because of Hughes' death, they go into the encounter leading the series 2-0. Hughes was on a score of 63 not out when the tragedy occurred and that number has been immortalised in Australia since then. However, to stop those out to make a quick profit from of it all Cricket Australia applied to have the phrase ‘63 not out’ trademarked under the name, and an agreement was reached. Scroll down for video . To preserve the memory of Philip Hughes Cricket Australia has decided to trademark the phrase ‘63 not out’ Hughes was on a score of 63 not out when he tragically died after getting hit by a bouncer in the head . Since Hughes' death merchandise has already been on sale online featuring the phrase . The move came after representatives of Cricket Australia and its legal representatives K & L Gates had discussions with Hughes' family and management last week to prevent potential unlicensed memorabilia. The West Australian reported that the agreement will cover several classes of goods and services including clothing and other memorabilia. It now means Cricket Australia controls the use of the phrase on all merchandise - a move they say was purely ‘defensive’. ‘Cricket Australia registered the trade mark in conjunction with Phillip's management purely as a defensive registration to prevent others trying to exploit Phillip's memory,’ a spokesman said. ‘There was some evidence of that starting to occur which is why we have taken this action.’ Hughes will again be with his team mates in spirit when they play the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne today . A tribute to Hughes featured the number 63 seen from inside the scoreboard during day four of the First Test match between Australia and India in Adelaide . Cricket Australia's main concern was unlicensed memorabilia. Merchandise relating to Hughes has been on sale online with T-shirts and stickers featuring the phrase already being sold, along with plaques detailing Hughes' career stats - including his final innings. It has been a difficult period for the Australian team since Hughes's death, particularly during the Christmas period. Australia captain Michael Clarke was devastated by his friend's death. On Christmas Day he took a moment to remember the best friend he called a brother. 'Today you will have Christmas with us bro,' he wrote next to a candle with Phillip's photo sitting on a mantle piece next to a framed picture of his friend with himself and wife Kyly Clarke on a night out. Injured Australian captain Michael Clarke (left) shares a joke with bowler Peter Siddle on day one of the Third Test between Australia and India at Melbourne Cricket Ground . Debutant on the Australia team Joe Burns (right) his congratulated by Clarke after he received his baggy green cap at Melbourne Cricket Ground . Clarke is currently injured but was at the MCG on Boxing Day for the start of the third Test against Australia. Before the match he could be seen chatting with his team mates as well as congratulating Joe Burns on making his debut for the side. The skipper limped off the field on the final day of the first Test in Adelaide against India holding his right hamstring and was forced to miss the rest of the series. Clarke, 33, had surgery on the hamstring injury last week and had initially feared that his career could be over. But he's not ready to hang up his bat just yet. In his column for the Daily Telegraph, Clarke wrote: 'The biggest thing for me at the moment is getting back on the field for the World Cup. 'I have been told by medical staff that I am in as good a condition as I can be a week after undergoing the surgery.' Australia will co-host the World Cup with New Zealand. The tournament begins on 14 February. Clarke makes a tearful farewell at Hughes' funeral service in Macksville . Representatives of Cricket Australia and its legal representatives K & L Gates had discussions with Hughes' family and management last week about image rights . Hughes was the 408th person to be selected to wear the famous baggy green cap and Australia’s Test cricketers are all wearing their late teammates numbers on their shirts in the four Tests against India this summer.","To prevent people making a quick profit off the cricketer's legacy Cricket Australia have trademarked the phrase ‘63 not out’

"A mother was left in agony after her Halloween contact lenses fused to her eye and had to be effectively ripped off. Nicola Cavanagh bought a pair of £10 'cat's eyes' lenses to wear to a party last weekend. But when it came to the end of the night, the 42-year-old could not get them out. Over the course of seven hours, the lenses had stuck fast to both her eyes. Nicola Cavanagh bought a pair of £10 'cat's eyes' lenses (pictured)  to wear to a Halloween party last weekend . Helped by her partner, Miss Cavanagh, from Dundee, eventually managed to remove lenses after an hour and a half, but was in such agony she had to go to hospital. There, a consultant confirmed the lenses had fused to her eye and removing them had damaged the top lining to the cornea - the clear later that covers the front of the eye. Miss Cavanagh, who works at a primary school, said: 'The doctors told me the lenses had ripped or damaged the top lining to the cornea. 'I was shown the damage on a chart and the consultant said it was quite bad. I was panicking.' She had bought the lenses from a local fancy dress shop to go with her zombie schoolgirl Halloween costume. Describing the ordeal of trying to remove them, she said: 'It felt like someone was pouring bleach into my eyes. 'I've never felt pain like it. I was screaming - it was absolutely horrific, like stabbing pains. 'I went into the bathroom and splashed water on my eyes. Then my partner got me some eye wash from ASDA but that was excruciating, too.' After being diagnosed in hospital she was prescribed pain relief, a lubricant gel to moisten the eye and drops to dilate her pupils to improve her vision. Her partner escorted her from the hospital with her eyes still closed from the pain. But at the end of the night, the 42-year-old could not get the lenses out, as they had 'fused' to her eyeballs . Doctors confirmed removing the lenses had damaged the top lining of her cornea - the clear layer that covers the front of the eye.  As a result, Miss Cavanagh's vision was so blurry she couldn't see . Just last week eye experts warned that party-goers are risking going blind for using novelty contact lenses. Poorly fitting lenses can lead to scratches or ulcers on the cornea, conjunctivitis, decreased vision and even blindness. Contact lenses should only be given out by a prescription in the UK. But novelty lenses can be bought and used without any safety checks being made on the eyes. This means some people who have never used lenses before are damaging their eyes just by putting them in the wrong way - and have no idea of the dangers of poor eye hygiene. Dr David Allamby, a consultant eye surgeon, said he is concerned that people are risking severe health consequences by using novelty lenses. 'Decorative contact lenses need to be treated in the same way as prescription contact lenses, with thorough guidance on how to put them in and follow up care. Contact lenses should only be fitted by a optometrist who measures each eye to fit the lenses and checks how the eyes respond, he said. 'It's quite shocking that you can just pick these things up on the internet or in a fancy dress shop with no advice or aftercare.' She went to bed when she get home but had to wake every four hours to prise her eyes open to apply drops and ointment. Miss Cavanagh, who also had to wear sunglasses to keep her eyes rested, said: 'Everything was a bit blurry the next morning. Bright lights are sore because the pupils are dilated.' She said the damage now seemed to be healing but said: 'It was very frightening. I couldn't see the eye chart the consultant was showing me.' She has also been off work since the incident and says her sight is so blurry she cannot read the time on her kitchen clock. Her friend, Shelley Traynor, 28, claims it also took her over an hour to remove one of her novelty lenses, which she claims became stuck to her left eyeball. She said: 'I got the right lens out OK, but when it came to the left one it was like there was no liquid in my eye at all. 'It was like it became fused to my eye. There was nothing to grab onto, there was no edge.' The mother-of-two she eventually removed the lens after soaking the eye with warm water. She added she had followed all of the instructions on the box but her eye was left red and sore. Today, the supplier of the lenses, Smiffy's, said it was temporarily withdrawing them from sale as a precaution while the situation was investigated.

He added: 'I have seen some terrible cases of injuries from contacts and novelty ones aren't likely to be of the same quality as those on prescription. Miss Cavanagh (before the incident) said the damage now seemed to be healing, but it had been a 'very frightening' experience . 'Even just putting them in incorrectly can lead to tears on the cornea, then bacteria breeds behind the lens which can lead to ulcers and ultimately blindness. 'After a party, people might sleep in them which increases the likelihood of infection. They need to understand there is a risk of them permanently damaging their eyes.' A spokeswoman for the Liverpool-based company that supplies the lenses Miss Cavangh used, said it was taking the complaint seriously. She said: 'We are sorry to hear that Nicola Cavanagh experienced this level of discomfort. 'However, as we do not manufacture the eye accessories we are working with, our supplier and everyone involved to establish exactly what has happened. 'While this investigation is being carried out we have blocked sales of the product in question as a precaution.

"The man who became the first person in the UK to have a successful hand transplant says he now is on the way to being '75 per cent recovered'. Mark Cahill, 53, made history when he had the operation on Boxing day 2012 at the Leeds General Infirmary. The father-of-one, from Greetland, West Yorkshire, had lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – when it became infected during a severe attack of gout, a condition he had suffered for 20 years. Mark Cahill, 53, made history when he had the UK's first hand transplant. Now, nearly two years on, is is able to pick up his new granddaughter, Dakota, just seven months old, and eat food without having it cut up for him . Mr Cahill says he is now on the way to being '75 per cent recovered' - and hopes to drive a manual car again . Surgery to cut the infection out had left him with a paralysed hand - and he had been forced to give up his job as a pub landlord. As his condition deteriorated, it became virtually impossible to do anything. 'My wife had to help me dress and cut my food up. You can imagine without any hands it's very difficult,' he said. The operation, painstakingly performed by a team led by plastic surgeon Professor Simon Kay, was a success - and 'transformed' Mr Cahill's life. His operation became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same procedure. While there have been other hand transplants worldwide, in those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery. Now, nearly two years on, Mr Cahill has been able to hold his grandson's hand again, tuck into a juicy steak and now pick up his new granddaughter, Dakota, just seven months old. Mr Cahill said the last two years had been like a rollercoaster ride, particularly after suffering a rejection scare just three days after the operation and a screw coming off after three months. The former pub landlord had lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – when it became infected during a severe attack of gout, a condition he had suffered for 20 years . Surgery to cut the infection out had left him with a paralysed hand - and he had been forced to give up his job as a pub landlord. Two years ago, he had the 'bad' hand removed and a new one transplanted (above) The process of rehabilitation is long - and it can take years for the nerves to come back. He said: 'I am definitely over 50 per cent better and heading to 75 per cent, though I will never get the feeling back completely. 'I don't have to rely on my wife so much now. I can wash myself in the bath, whereas I could only wash half of my body before. 'I also can pick my grandchildren up, which is a marvellous feeling.' Before the operation, for all of his grandson Thomas's life, Mr Cahill had to settle for 'just observing' the little boy, rather than be able to play with him. Since the op, the two have been able to hold hands. And despite being naturally left-handed, he can now hold a steering wheel with his transplanted hand - and says he may eventually go back to driving a manual car. He added: 'I can open tins and tie my own tie, use a mobile phone. Shoelaces I can do just about, though they are not easy.' The operation, painstakingly performed by a team led by plastic surgeon Professor Simon Kay, at Leeds General Infirmary, was a success - and 'transformed' Mr Cahill's life . 'Even better, I can hold a knife and fork properly and tuck into a nice steak in a restaurant without having to have my food cut up first.' Mr Cahill, who has one daughter, Danielle, is full of gratitude to the family of the donor. His wife Sylvia added: 'It was a wonderful thing to do. It must have been really difficult for them but I'll always be grateful for the choice they made.' Mr Cahill had been unable to use his right hand for five years after it became infected owing to severe gout, an acute form of arthritis caused by a build-up of uric acid in the blood. He and Sylvia were forced to give up their beloved village pub, the Shears Inn in Greetland, near Halifax, because of his disability. Mr Cahill, a former rugby league player, was also left wheelchair-bound at one point when the gout affected his spine. However in late 2011, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust announced it was starting to look for potential candidates for hand or arm transplants. Before having the op, his mobility had become so bad that wife Sheila (pictured) had to help him dress anhd cut up his food. 'You can imagine without any hands it's very difficult,' he said . An LGI team had been preparing and assessing potential recipients from across the country. Mr Cahill was part of the programme and had to undergo a series of health checks, as well as psychological assessments to ensure potential patients had properly considered the implications of the procedure. Hand transplants have already been carried out by doctors in the United States, Austria and France leading the way for other transplant operations of such organs as the face, abdominal wall or larynx. The first major organ to be transplanted successfully was a cornea, by Eduard Zirm in Olmutz, Czech Republic in 1905, but not until nearly 50 years later, in 1954, did doctors in Boston successfully transplant a kidney. The first successful heart transplant was by Dr Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967, and was followed by the first heart and liver transplants in the UK the following year. Not until 1983 did Britain see the first combined heart and lung transplant. In 2005, the first partial face transplant was carried out, in Amiens, France where Isabelle Dinoire, a 38-year-old woman who had been mauled by her dog, was given a new nose, chin and lips. Five years later the first full face transplant was carried out, in Barcelona, Spain, on a farmer known only as Oscar who had been injured in a shooting accident. He received the entire facial skin and muscles - including cheekbones, nose, lips and teeth - of a donor. In October 2006, surgeon Peter Butler at London's Royal Free Hospital was given permission by the NHS ethics board to carry out a face transplant. His team will select four adult patients for operations. Accurate restoration of nerve structures was one thing, but there were a multitude of factors to accommodate in the aftermath including regular physiotherapy, hand exercises and occupational therapy as well as adjusting to a lifetime of taking immuno-suppressant drugs. But Mr Cahill said: 'Anything I have now is better than what I had before this operation. I'm hoping to eventually get back to work – I'm already moving my fingers and the doctors say I'm making quicker progress than they expected.' He added he shocked when he was offered the ground-breaking surgery less than three months after he was added to the transplant register. 'After a lot of tests, Professor Kay (the plastic surgeon who performed the operation) told me I could be a candidate for a hand transplant, and asked me to give it some thought. When doctors learned that a hand suitable for transplant had become available they called in Mr Cahill for tests to check how his tissue matched with that of the donor. He said: 'I was called into the hospital along with another recipient, and they tested us to see which was the stronger match – and I was.' Within hours the doctors began the gruelling surgery, which saw his hand removed and the replacement attached in the same operation. Mr Cahill added: 'It didn't feel real until I woke up after the operation. It felt like a dream, even when I was going into theatre.' He added: 'It's how I expected it to look, because I've done a lot of research about hand transplants. 'But you can do all the research you want and you don't know how you're going to feel – I've had a lot of help from psychologists because the biggest thing is afterwards, whether I would accept it as mine.'","Mark Cahill, 53, made history when he had the operation in December 2012 .

"Nasir Mahmood was already in hospital for a routine procedure on his heart when he started showing classic stoke symptoms - but was still sent home . An angry daughter has accused hospital staff of sending her father home from hospital while he was having a stroke. Nasir Mahmood was already at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire for a routine procedure on his heart when he started showing classic stoke symptoms. Despite the side of his face drooping and starting to slur his speech while dribbling, his daughter Iman claims nurses told her he was 'absolutely fine' and could return home. But soon as the 48-year-old reached his house in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, she was forced to call an ambulance to take him straight back to hospital. Just an hour after leaving, medics confirmed he was suffering a stroke at A&E and readmitted him. Today she lambasted NHS staff for failing to spot the tell-tale signs of a life-threatening stroke. Miss Mahmood, 26, said: 'They say the safest place to have a stroke is in hospital. So dad was in the right place at the right time, but it meant nothing. 'When we rang to check how things had gone the nurse said he was absolutely fine and to collect him at 6.30pm. 'But I spoke to dad on the phone and he was clearly slurring his words. 'When we arrived to fetch him he was sitting alone in the atrium totally confused and with his face lop-sided. 'Although he was showing the classic signs of a stroke developing, nobody realised and he was discharged into the night.' Miss Mahmood, who used to work for the 111 NHS helpline, added: 'If a caller described these symptoms, my computer would have automatically flagged it as a possible stroke needing an ambulance. 'At a pre-assessment clinic the previous week, mum had been told she would be able to stay through his heart procedure. 'But on the day itself she was told as it was a male-only area she had to leave and call back later.' Takeaway owner Mr Mahmood had been into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire for an operation on an existing heart condition. After returning from the operating theatre, Pakistan-born Mr Mahmood said he was already slurring and could not swallow or fasten his trousers. He believes the symptoms were not picked up as he could not communicate with the doctors, who did not allow English-born wife Meelam to stay to interpret. Speaking through his daughter Mr Mahmood added: 'I am very upset they neglected to pick up such a serious illness. 'I thought what was happening was caused by the medication I had just had for the operation. Despite the side of her father's face drooping and starting to slur his speech while dribbling, his daughter Iman (pictured) claims nurses told her he was 'absolutely fine' and could return home . Just an hour after leaving, medics at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) confirmed Mr Mahmood was suffering a stroke at A&E and readmitted him . 'I couldn't tell them it could be a stroke as I have never been through this before. 'And even if I had, they wouldn't have understood me.' His family has now contacted the PALS patient advocacy service and are also lodging a formal complaint. Miss Mahmood added: 'Luckily dad is making a good recovery but I can't believe professionals missed what was happening.' University Hospital of North Staffordshire nursing director Amanda Wood said: 'We are aware of Mr Mahmood's case. 'Although we can't discuss his care in detail, so far as we are aware he was treated in a proper and appropriate manner. 'We will of course contact them about any concerns they may have.' Despite his ordeal, Mr Mahmood is now expected to make a full recovery.","Nasir Mahmood had been at University Hospital of North Staffordshire .

"A Japanese mushroom could hold the key to killing the virus that causes cervical cancer. The Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common, and highly contagious, infection that affects skin and the moist membrane linings of the body, for example, in the cervix, mouth and throat. More than three quarters of all women acquire the virus during their lives and some strains can cause cervical cancer. Japanese shiitake mushrooms contain a unique chemical called AHCC, which may help boost the immune system and block tumour growth . But new American research has found an extract found in shiitake mushrooms may play a role in preventing HPV-related cancers. HPV is spread via sexual contact and causes cervical cancer in women as well as cancer of the throat, anus and penis. Shiitake mushrooms, which have been used medicinally in their native East Asia for centuries, . They contain a unique chemical called active hexose correlated compound (AHCC), which is a mixture of amino acids, polysaccharides and minerals. Currently, there is no effective medicine or supplement to treat HPV, which is associated with more than 99 percent of cervical cancer cases. In the new study, 10 women with the HPV virus were given an extract of the mushroom, once a day for six months. Of those, five were successfully treated and the pilot clinical trial  is now being extended to include a larger number of patients. Professor Judith Smith, of the University of Texas, said: 'The results are very encouraging. 'We were able to determine at least three months of treatment is necessary but some need to extend that to six months. 'Since AHCC is a nutritional supplement with no side effects and other immune modulating benefits, we will be planning on using six months of treatment in our phase two clinical study to have consistent study treatment plan.' Previous research has shown AHCC boosts the immune system by increasing the number of cells which help the body fight off infections and block tumour growth. The Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common, and highly contagious, infection which can cause cervical cancer. Currently, there is no effective medicine or supplement to treat HPV . Professor Smith presented her results at an International Conference of the Society for Integrative Oncology in Texas. It is understood that while the results were seen in women, AHCC will have the same result on men. It may also be capable of treating genital warts in men. Earlier this year, she reported that in mice, AHCC led to the eradication of HPV within 90 days. It also decreased the rate of cervical tumour growth. AHCC works as an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that uses a body's own immune system to help fight disease. Dr Smith said: 'AHCC is a common, well tolerated nutritional supplement that has been used for decades in Japan. 'I am very excited to be pursuing a nutritional approach to trying to find a treatment for HPV infections.'","Extract found in shiitake mushrooms may help prevent HPV-related cancers .

"Jasmine Bishop was so determined to reach her target weight of 6st that she took 20 laxatives a day . A young woman who suffered cruel taunts about her figure ended up necking 20 laxatives a day because she was so desperate lose weight. Jasmine Bishop was so fixated on dropping from 12st to 6st that she became embroiled in a cycle of binge eating, vomiting and laxative abuse. Every night while her parents were asleep she would swallow the pills, bought from a local chemist, before spending most of the night on the loo - often falling asleep there. It was only when her tearful father begged her to get help that she reluctantly saw a doctor. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Miss Bishop, now 22, explained how her health declined dramatically within a year. At 17, she had gone to her doctor about irregular periods and, as part of the consultation, was weighed. 'I was told I was classed as obese,' she told This Morning presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes. 'Then I started getting comments from young lads, calling me a fat midget, and ""look at her"".' While the process started gradually, 'within a year my whole life had ended up in this massive bubble of just me and this eating disorder,' she said. 'No one else understood what I was going through and no matter how much they said ""you look fine"" or ""Jas, you are beautiful"", it was no good. 'In my head, I had a goal weight - and that was what I was going to get to.' In her desperation to lose more and more weight, she resorted to a number of drastic measures - and by time she sought help, she was diagnosed with multiple eating disorders. 'I was binge eating, vomiting and relying heavily on sugary drinks to keep me going,' she said. Courtesy of ITV's 'The Morning' 'And on top of that, I was always looking for more ways to lose weight - like laxatives.' A box of 60 costing £6 would last her for just three days, because she would down a staggering 20 at a time. In a bid to hide her addiction, she would take the pills late at night, just as her parents went to bed. Then, as the explosive effects of the drugs kicked in, she would dash to the loo and spend most of the night there. 'Most of the time I fell asleep on the loo,' she recalled. 'I thought my parents didn't know, but looking back,' they did. And with many people complaining even one or two laxatives can cause terrible stomach cramps and diarrhoea, what effect did 20 have on her body? Miss Bishop told This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'After taking the pills, I would be rocking backwards and forwards in agony' Teenage anorexics are being put at risk because supermarkets are handing over powerful laxatives without any restrictions or age controls, an investigation has found. Laxative abuse can cause kidney failure . Concerns about the sale of the medicines to youngsters who are dangerously thin and ill were first raised by the eating disorder charity Beat five years ago. However, an undercover survey recently revealed that leading supermarkets continue to dish out laxatives to 14-year-olds without asking questions. Beat is calling for a change in the law or voluntary measures by stores to ban laxative sales to under-16s. The group also wants the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets with sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label that reads: ‘this is not a weight loss product’. The charity’s chief executive, Susan Ringwood, said there is evidence that an increasing number of youngsters are using laxatives as part of their drastic weight loss regimes. She said: ‘We have seen a 30 per cent increase in calls to our helplines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way. And that does include a significant number of young people as well.’ Miss Bishop said: 'I would be rocking backwards and forwards in agony. 'Fifteen hours of labour was nothing compared to being on that toilet every night,' she said. Asked why, if the pain was so bad, she continued, she replied: 'It was in my head that I was fat and I wanted to lose loads of weight. 'If I couldn't get it out of one end, by being sick, I would get it out the other.' Medical experts warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death. Miss Bishop's constant exhaustion and trips to the loo began to sound alarm bells with her worried family. Then, when her hair began falling out in clumps due to malnutrition, her parents confronted her. And their reaction was what shocked Miss Bishop, from Hampshire, into taking action. She told Ruth and Eamonn: 'I have never seen my dad cry, but he was nearly in tears. 'He said: ""We've lost you. You're not my little girl any more"". 'He could usually get me to talk, but this time I had shut everyone out. 'In the end, my mum begged me to get some help.' She was prescribed antidepressants by her GP and slowly began to eat selected foods. Today, thanks to specialist treatment, she has returned to a healthy weight and gone onto have a baby daughter. Her little girl has also given her more important things to focus on, she said. 'I don't have the energy to sit on the loo all night,' she explained. And she urged others not to fall into the terrible weight loss trap that she did. 'Don't do it. Once you have an eating disorder you can never look at food in the way again. 'I can't look at a burger in the same way and I can't just sit on the couch and have a lazy day. 'It's a mental disorder and it ruins your body. Thankfully, I see myself a lot differently now.'","Jasmine Bishop, now 22, was fixated on dropping from 12st to 6st .

"The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear a new challenge to President Barack Obama's health care law that would threaten federal subsidies that help millions of low- and middle-income people afford their health insurance premiums. The justices said they will review a unanimous federal appeals court ruling that upheld Internal Revenue Service regulations that allow health-insurance tax credits under the Affordable Care Act for consumers in all 50 states, regardless of whether they signed up through their state exchanges or through the federal healthcare site. Opponents argue that federal subsidies are illegal because of the way health care reform legislation was worded. The bill specifically notes that subsidies are available 'through an exchange established by the state' - not by the federal government. Scroll down for video . In this March 28, 2012 file photo supporters of health care reform rally in front of the Supreme Court in Washington on the final day of arguments regarding the health care law signed by President Barack Obama. The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear a new challenge to the law that seeks to invalidate federal subsidies . White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the congressional intent behind the law is for eligible customers regardless of where they live to receive assistance from the government to subsidize the purchase of health care. He promised a vigorous defense before the high court. 'We continue to have high confidence in the legal argument, both from a legal perspective and a common-sense perspective. This is a law that is working, that's why you'll see a vigorous defense here,' Earnest told reporters on Friday. The long-running political and legal campaign to overturn or limit the 2010 health overhaul will be making its second appearance at the Supreme Court. The justices upheld the heart of the law in a 5-4 decision in 2012 in which Chief Justice John Roberts provided the decisive vote. In the appeal accepted Friday, opponents of the subsidies argued that the court should resolve the issue now because it involves billions of dollars in public money. 'Today’s grant of cert by the Supreme Court is excellent news, regardless of which side of the issue you’re on,' Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a group funding the Obamacare challenge, said today in a statement. 'The need for a quick and final resolution of this question is undeniable. 'This ""subsidies-for-everyone"" rule affects nearly every person across the country—health insurance policyholders, workers and employers, taxpayers, and state and local governments,' he added. The court rarely steps into a case when there is no disagreement among federal appellate courts, unless a law or regulation has been ruled invalid. But at least four justices, needed to grant review, apparently agreed with the challengers that the issue is important enough to decide now. Supporters of the health care law were flabbergasted and accused the court of verging into politics. The news came a week ahead of the second open enrollment season for subsidized private health insurance under the law. 'All of the general guidelines that the court traditionally uses in determining whether it should schedule an appeal are totally absent in this case,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group that supported Obama's health overhaul from its inception. Pollack called the court's action 'an unusual political act.' The legal challenge to the subsidies is 'the most serious existential threat' facing the Affordable Care Act, added Pollack. Maria Alvarado, 30, holds her 10-month-old son, Kevin Rios, as she waits in line at a health insurance enrollment event in Cudahy, California, in March. Because California has its own Obamacare exchange, the states residents are not immediately in danger of losing government subsides if the new Obamacare case succeeds . The health care law provides taxpayer-subsidized private health insurance for people who don't have access to coverage on the job. More than 4 out of 5 of the roughly 7 million people currently enrolled are getting help, which is keyed to household income and the cost of a benchmark plan. When the court upheld the law in 2012, it still made a major change to Obama's signature legislation by ruling that its Medicaid expansion for low-income people was optional for states. So far 27 states and the District of Columbia have accepted it. This week's Republican election success makes it unlikely that the remaining 23 states will move any time soon. The subsidies issue is being fought in several courts. In July, the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court upheld Internal Revenue Service regulations that allow health-insurance tax credits under the law for consumers in all 50 states. On that same July day, a panel of appellate judges in the District of Columbia, sided with the challengers in striking down the IRS regulations. The Washington court held that under the law, financial aid can be provided only in states that have set up their own insurance markets, known as exchanges. For those federal exchange consumers, the subsidies cover 76 percent of their premiums, on average. Customers now pay an average of $82 on total monthly premiums averaging $346. The federal subsidy of $264 a month makes up the difference. But in October, the entire Washington appeals court voted to rehear the case and threw out the panel's ruling, eliminating the so-called circuit split. The appeals argument has been scheduled for December 17, but that case now recedes in importance with the Supreme Court's action to step in. The case, King v. Burwell, probably will be argued the first week in March, with a decision expected by late June. News of the Supreme Court case broke just as President Obama was sitting down with congressional leaders, some of whom have threatened to repeal his signature law. If opponents of the law succeed in convincing the high court to rule in their favor, it could be easier for Republican leaders in Congress to get Democrats on board with reforms to the bill given that millions of Americans the law was intended to benefit will be shut out of receiving the government subsidies that make compliance with the individual mandate portion of the law financially feasible for them. Conservatives hope the law will unravel entirely, allowing lawmakers to redo health care reform from scratch. Republican and Democratic lawmakers lined up on Friday to weigh in on the court's decision to review the subsidies clause in Obamacare. GOP legislators of course trumpeted their support for the high court's announcement while Democrats slammed the suit as an attack on the less fortunate. 'The Obama administration has been potentially doling out billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies without the proper statutory authority and I applaud the Supreme Court’s decision to review this case,' Tennessee Rep. Diane Black, a Republican, said in a statement. Fellow Tennessee Rep. Scott Desjarlais, one of several doctors in Congress, said that the case 'presents the best chance of finally abolishing President Obama’s health care law' because it is 'beyond clear'  that its unconstitutional for the IRS, a government bureaucracy, to be 're-writing a major portion of the Affordable Care Act – an action reserved exclusively for Congress.' 'This goes beyond health care to the very heart of our nation’s democratic system of government,' Desjarlais said. 'I hope the justices will rule accordingly by striking down this unconstitutional power grab by the Obama administration.' Likewise, House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa claimed that 'the sloppy and rushed nature of the process that created the health law is rightly catching up to it.' 'The statute provides no authority for subsidies through the federal exchange, and proponents of the law cannot cover-up their regrets by ignoring the plain text of the law when it proves inconvenient.' Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Sander Levin, the ranking member on the House Ways and Means committee argued that the 'lawsuit misconstrues the intent of the authors of the Affordable Care Act.' Pointing out the repercussions of the suit if the Supreme Court sides with conservatives, Levin said, 'Low- and middle-income Americans who live in states that chose not to establish their own marketplaces should not be penalized simply because their state decided to defer to the federal government. 'As the ranking member of one of the committees that shaped and debated the healthcare law, I am confident that the Supreme Court will recognize both the letter and intent of the law to ensure that financial assistance remains available in every state,' the Michigan representative said.","Only Americans enrolled in health care through the federal exchange would be affected, not those enrolled through their state exchanges .
Law says that only Americans enrolled in state exchanges are eligible for government subsidies to help them afford health care insurance .
Democrats say court should abide by intent of the law, which is for all eligible low- and middle-income Americans to receive aid .
If the high court rules with opponents of the law, they hope Obamacare will unravel entirely, allowing Congress to redo health care reform from scratch ."
