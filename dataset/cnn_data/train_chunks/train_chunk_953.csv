"By . Simon Jones for MailOnline . Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero has denied reports that he rejected a move to Manchester United. The 27-year-old, whose penalty saves helped his country defeat Louis Van Gaal's Holland at the World Cup, was offered to United in the summer as his club Sampdoria looked to move him on.

Sergio Romero celebrates during the World Cup semi-final penalty shootout in Sao Paolo . Romero dives to his right to save Wesley Sneijder's penalty in the World Cup semi-final penalty shootout . Romero was also discussed by Liverpool, however, talking to Radio Nacional, he said: 'Many lies have been spread, like, for example, that I refused a transfer to Manchester United. To me, something like that is crazy.' Romero played under van Gaal at AZ Alkmaar and is behind Emiliano Viviano in the pecking order at Sampdoria. He added: 'I can’t do this for much longer. The same thing happened to me in France – arriving a club when the transfer window is nearly closed and having to wait for an opportunity. 'I am happy at Sampdoria, though, and I will keep showing the coach that I am ready to play and that I don’t want to keep sitting on the bench.'

"By . Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail . Four years ago he was christened ‘Wee Mac’ by the Celtic Manor crowd and that chimed just perfectly with Graeme McDowell’s thoughts about Rory McIlroy. G-Mac was the US Open champion and how he loved striding the fairways and showing the ropes to his fellow Northern Irishman, making his debut in the Ryder Cup and who he looked upon as a younger brother. That all changed at Medinah two years later. My, how the younger brother had grown. Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell have had public issues with their relationship, but are friends now . The Northern Irish pair have played together at both of the last two Ryder Cups with some success . Now he was world No 1 and a major champion in his own right, and when he struck his drive on the first hole in fourballs it flew so far it came to rest 350 yards away. And G-Mac thought to himself: ‘What on earth is the point of me trying to follow that?’ Europe captain Paul McGinley opened a can of worms when he hinted on Monday that the pair would probably not play together at this 40th Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. He pointed to bare statistics and, if truth be told, he raised as many questions as answers, not least given the background of the strained relationship between McIlroy and McDowell over the past couple of years. But then came G-Mac on Tuesday to put a little flesh on the bones. ‘Myself and Rory, there’s no doubt our personal issues (McIlroy is suing his former management company, Horizon, where McDowell is a shareholder) have been well documented but I believe we’ve come out of it better friends than we were going into it, so that’s not the issue this weekend,’ he said. Graeme McDowell said on Tuesday that he was unsure whether it suited his game to play with McIlroy again . Europe captain Paul McGinley has hinted that he may keep the Norther Irishmen apart this week . VIDEO Pundits provide insight into pairings . ‘I’ll be the first to admit, and Rory and I have spoken about this, I found it very difficult playing with him in the fourballs at Medinah. He likes to go first, he hits it miles and so then I’m throwing myself at my ball. It really didn’t help my game playing with him in fourballs. ‘But foursomes is different. Who wouldn’t want to be playing their second shot off a 350-yard drive? I think we could still play foursomes really well together.’ Will they get the chance? It might need proceedings to be going seriously wrong for it to happen. McGinley has identified another rookie for McDowell to shepherd over the practice sessions and that is enigmatic Frenchman Victor Dubuisson. It is a role McDowell would be only too happy to have from Friday onwards. ‘Perhaps I’m the kind of guy who needs to feel like he is on at least the same level as the guy he is playing with,’ he said. ‘I’d very much enjoy the task of blooding Victor — for want of a better expression — and I would love to play with him. We are talking about that happening.’ McIlroy has become world no 1 and won four majors since he was first paired with McDowell in 2010 . The Northern Irishman is crucial to Europe's hopes and McGinley knows his pairings will be crucial . From the outside at least, it is amazing to hear someone as tough under pressure as McDowell speak in terms of an inferiority complex, as he does about McIlroy. You would think it would manifest itself when under extreme pressure but as we all know, in this particular instance, it’s the exact opposite. ‘I’ve been lucky enough to hit a few good shots under the gun in my career,’ said G-Mac. ‘I’m a guy that certainly embraces the high-pressure scenarios. I guess I’ve been blessed with some level of fortitude and I’ve often wondered where I got it from. ‘Over the past 10 years I’ve worked it out that I got it from my mum. She’s an MS sufferer and a pretty tough cookie. Two things she gave me are perspective and some strength of mind. I would love to get a chance to test it out again this weekend.’ McIroy and McDowell celebrate together after Europe's remarkable comback victory in 2012 . The European team poses for a photo ahead of their attempt to win a third Ryder Cup in a row . McDowell hit Europe’s last shot of the 2010 Ryder Cup and the first one two years later. In three appearances he has experienced losing and winning in America as well as being the hero at Celtic Manor. ‘I’ve certainly ridden that Ryder Cup rollercoaster,’ he said, smiling. This time he is experiencing . something slightly different — being part of a team who are heavy favourites. ‘It is an unusual scenario but we’re very proud of the label,’ he said. McDowell helped McIlroy adjust to the competition as a rookie but the younger man has moved on . ‘We watched a video in the team room last night showing the growth of the European Tour and how we’ve gone from getting drummed in every Ryder Cup to the turning points with Tony Jacklin and Seve to the present day where we’ve won seven of the last nine. ‘What we’re not going to do is get sucked in by that favourites tag. We like being favourites but it’s important to play like underdogs. That’s what we are going for.’ Away from the course, McDowell began this Ryder Cup qualifying process by getting married and ended it last month by becoming a parent. Now it is back to playing big brother. After his struggles at Medinah, he is ready to lead by example once more.","Northern Irish pair have played together in last two Ryder Cups .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter are not the only European players with targets on their backs this week, according to Ryder Cup team-mate Graeme McDowell. United States captain Tom Watson has repeatedly said he is looking to take down 'big dogs' McIlroy and Poulter, the former being the world number one and four-time major winner and the latter earning the nickname 'Mr Ryder Cup' due to his heroics in the biennial contest. Poulter's most recent heroics inspired the 'Miracle at Medinah' in 2012, when Europe recovered from 10-6 down on the final day to claim a remarkable seventh win in the last nine contests. Graeme McDowell said that the US team's poor record means they are under huge pressure to win this year . The home side are rated odds-on favourites to improve that statistic further at Gleneagles this weekend, but McDowell insists they are not acting as such and is well aware of how determined the American side are to make amends for what happened two years ago. 'I think it's an unusual scenario for the Europeans to be favourites coming into a Ryder Cup,' McDowell said. 'It's not a sort of label that we take lightly. We are very proud of the label. 'We watched a video in the team room last night (Monday) which really described how far the European Tour had come, all the way back from the 1950s and '60s and getting drummed year-in and year-out in the Ryder Cup, to the turning point with (Tony) Jacklin and Seve (Ballesteros) and everything that went on in that period when the Europeans started to realise that perhaps they could compete on the global stage and they could compete in Ryder Cups, to the present day. American captain Tom Watson said they will target Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter at Gleneagles . 'We are proud of the label, but we are also very aware that this is a big Ryder Cup this week, because we do feel the need for the US team to win one. We certainly feel like they will be coming at us 100 per cent this weekend and we have to be ready for that. We are not taking them lightly. 'We heard a stat last night that when both teams were solidified after the picks that their average world ranking was better than our average world ranking. It might not be the same, at this moment we might be slightly favourites again, but we are under no illusions that this team is great. 'They have a lot of young blood on their team which is going to ignite that passion that we've always had. I think we have got targets on our back this week and we are aware of that, and we are going to be ready for it. 'We are not getting sucked in by the favourite tag. We are going to play like underdogs.' McDowell also said that Europe's team are proud of their favourites tag but ill not become complacent . European captain Paul McGinley was not quite sure what Watson meant about 'targeting' opposition players in a non-contact sport, but in any case he has no concerns that McIlroy and Poulter can cope with whatever is thrown at them. 'The two guys earned that reputation,' McGinley said. 'They have played so well. Rory to be number one in the world and Ian Poulter with his performances in the Ryder Cup. It's not something that we should be afraid of or embarrassed about. 'I can tell you one thing, it's a real motivating factor for both of them that they know that it's a big focus on the Americans playing them. McIlroy has enjoyed an excellent season, including winning The Open, propelling him to world No 1 . 'I think Rory has handled the expectancy on him as world number one incredibly well. A lot of the tournaments he's won, he's won from a commanding position. He seems to be very comfortable when he has the favourite tag. 'Ian Poulter is the same. Every Ryder Cup you go in and you question is Ian Poulter going to perform, and he does. His record is sensational (12 wins in 15 matches) and he's very proud of it. 'That's one of the fruits of all his labours in the Ryder Cup, to have a target on him. I think Ian Poulter is relishing that. He's relishing that fact. He likes playing the villain. 'He was the guy they all wanted to bring down (in Medinah) and he went out and produced, and not only did he produce Saturday night but he went out on Sunday and produced in the singles again.' Ian Poulter has won 12 of his 15 Ryder Cup matches, including an impressive singles victory at Medinah . McGinley added: 'I'm going to put out the team as I see fit, and whatever comments they have and whatever ideas Tom has to motivate his team, he'll do. I'm concerned with our team and making sure we're prepared. 'I'm not targeting anybody on the American team. We know they are a very strong team one to 12 and whoever is playing this is going to be tough. We are under no illusions how strong this American team is, under no illusions whatsoever. This is going to be a tough Ryder Cup to win.' McDowell, who secured the winning point at Celtic Manor in 2010, agreed with his captain's assessment, adding: 'I couldn't pick two better guys to handle that type of pressure. Rory's the best player in the world and I expect him to win several points this weekend. 'And Poults is just Poults, so he'll be ready. Bring it on.'

"By . Mitch Phillips, Press Association . Bubba Watson played down his newly-acquired 'big dog' epithet on Tuesday and said he was ready to curb his exuberance if he felt it could help his American team deal with what is likely to be a red-hot Ryder Cup atmosphere this week. Earlier on Tuesday United States captain Tom Watson said the big-hitting two-times Masters winner would probably be the man the Europeans would most like to beat, just as his team have their crosshairs firmly fixed on Ian Poulter. Both players have reveled in the noisy atmosphere of the Ryder Cup, particularly in 2012 when they positively encouraged the crowd to keep on cheering right through their swings when they squared off in a memorable foursomes. Bubba Watson dismissed the idea that he is a 'big dog' and said all that matters is the USA team winning . Watson is known for playing to the crowd, but he promised not to be 'goofy' during the Ryder Cup . USA captain Tom Watson, pictured here with the Ryder Cup on Tuesday, called Bubba a 'big dog' Despite both players missing their fairways with their opening drives, they continued to gee up the crowd all the way round the Medinah course. 'When you're at home, you can do other things and be goofy, but when you're away, you don't want to do anything like that, even though we had some fun a couple years ago with getting the crowd revved up,' Watson told reporters. 'I'm just here to play golf, make some putts. But you know, the Ryder Cup brings out a different audience sometimes and people that might not play golf. So for us it was about how you're going to try to grow the game. So I thought that making it fun instead of a six-hour round would be my way of doing it. And so we tried to make it fun a couple years ago. 'I've won a few matches, lost a few matches and still haven't won a Ryder Cup, so obviously it hasn't propelled our team to win one yet.' The USA team are very wary of the threat posed by Ian Poulter, who performed heroically in the 2012 Ryder Cup . Watson laughed off his captain's 'tribute' however, saying 'he's making that up. He's making attention come to me when it's the other guys.' Though Watson the younger might grab the attention in the same way Poulter does, he has some way to go in matching the Englishman's ability to harvest points. Poulter is yet to win a major but finds his best form for Europe every two years, having won all four of his singles matches and boasts a remarkable 12 wins and three defeats from his 15 matches in four Ryder Cups. Bubba Watson won the Masters in 2012 and 2014 and will be a key man for the USA at Gleneagles . Watson, a double major champion, has lost five of his eight matches, including both singles, in his two appearances in 2010 and 2012 but bears his rival no ill-will. 'Poulter, what he's done in the Ryder Cup, obviously has grown the game,' said the American. 'There's been some kids out there that want to do the same thing he's done, the way he's come up, his background. I mean, what a story that is and what a great talent that is. His passion, his energy and his great play and his great putting.' Watson also dismissed his captain's claim that this week represented a chance for redemption for Medinah, when the U.S. managed to throw away a 10-6 lead to lose on the final day. 'It's golf that motivates me, I'm not worried about two years ago,' he said. 'I've lost many a golf tournament in my day. I've only won a few in my life. Every time I get to the course, I want to beat whoever it is I'm playing, if it's my buddies at home or if it's the members or if it's at a professional golf tournament. 'That's really what it is about me, just trying to win that little trophy, that's our goal. 'I'm not worried about what happened a few years ago. If I did that, I'd be a terrible golfer because I lost a lot.' Watson played in the USA's capitulation in Medinah two years ago and is pictured here straight afterwards .

"By . Marcus Townend For Mail Online . Roger Charlton is to run Al Kazeem in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday. The six-year-old, a three-time group one winner in 2013, has raced three times since returning to training this summer after encountering fertility problems at stud, winning the 10-furlong Group Three Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor before finishing fifth to The Grey Gatsby in the Irish Champion Stakes last time out. Charlton, whose dual Group Three winning miler Captain Cat tries to win his first Group Two prize in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket on Friday, said: ‘The step up in trip and step down in class is just Al Kazeem needs.’ Al Kazeem will run in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday . Roger Charlton believes the step up in trip and step down in class is just what Al Kazeem needs . The Cumberland Lodge Stakes was an option for Jeremy Noseda’s Grandeur but the gelding, who has run three times without luck across the Atlantic this summer, will again be on his travel with a shot at the $1million Canadian International at Woodbine on October 19. The five-year-old won the Listed Foundation Stakes at Goodwood for the second year running but Noseda will be have to look for a new jockey in Canada. Wednesday’s rider Ryan Moore should be needed for Sir Michael Stoute-trained Hillstar, a winner at Newbury on Saturday. Noseda’s Newmarket colleague Roger Varian may have just won his first Classic with Kingston Hill in the St Leger but there was one surprising omission from his CV. Until Andre Atzeni-ridden 15-8 favourite American Artist passed the post first in the British Stallions Stud Maiden Stakes, Varian had never had a winner at Goodwood from 50 runners in his four-year training career. Varian confirmed that Kingston Hill was on course for a crack at the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on October 5, saying: ‘It is all systems go – I have been very pleased with his since the Leger.’ Roger Varians says Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season . Varian also refused to rule out the possibility that his Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season. Moore was also successful on his father Gary’s Good Luck Charm. That stretched his title race lead to five (142-137) over Richard Hughes, who also picked up a two-day whip ban on runner-up Shadow Rock.","Six-year-old has raced three times since encountering fertility problems .

"By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . The St Leger, racing’s oldest Classic, and host track Doncaster have received a major boost with news that sponsors Ladbrokes have extended their deal until 2016. It had been feared that the bookmaker would pull out of backing the race it had supported for 10 years because of the fresh clash with the new Irish Champions weekend. Ladbrokes and Doncaster were both left deeply frustrated that the rival fixture was nodded through with BHA support without any consultation with them. Kingston Hill (far left) powered to victory in this year's St Leger at Doncaster racecourse . That frustration still festers but fears that the inaugural Irish meeting would detract from the Leger proved unfounded. Over 60,000 attended the four-day meeting, half of them on St Leger day and viewing figures in Channel 4 were up. However, Ladbrokes have warned any hope of the deal being extended further heavily depends on the wider commercial deals in the sport involving Levy plus Data and Media rights. More than 60,000 fans attended the four-day meeting at Doncaster and TV viewing figures were up . Nick Rust, Managing Director of Ladbrokes Retail, said: ‘It is well known within the industry that we were disappointed by the BHA's approach to supporting the decision of Irish Champions weekend to clash with Ladbrokes St Leger weekend. ‘We were concerned that having worked so hard with Doncaster and others in racing to restore the status of the race, the move could lead to conflicts of interests for many in the build-up to the race and on the day itself. ‘The easy thing to do would be to walk away from the Leger now that our current agreement has ended. It would save us significant costs and make a clear point about our frustrations with the way in which the race planning developments played out. ‘However, at a time when British Racing and betting operators are working hard to find a sustainable, commercially-based model for our future partnership, and one which addresses the substantial issues arising from the double-whammy of declining consumer interest in betting on racing and increasing costs to betting operators, such a decision would be short-sighted and unhelpful. Michael Owen with his horse Brown Panther was among high-profile winners at the Irish Champions Weekend . ‘We want to continue to build the profile of the Ladbrokes St Leger and our successful partnership with ARC. ‘We see this sponsorship renewal as part of a potential template for the way in which betting operators and commercial organisations within British Racing can work together for the long term. ‘All of our sponsorships will now be considered within a wider commercial framework covering other elements of the flow of our funds to parties in British Racing - specifically Levy, Media Rights, Racecourse Data Rights and other media / advertising spend.’ Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said the firm would continue to monitor the effect of the fixture clash despite the initial encouraging figures. He added: ‘Irish Champions weekend is not going to get any smaller nor is its marketing spend. We will be watching the situation going forward.’","Ladbrokes have extended sponsorship deal until 2016 .

"By . Mark Webster . Follow @@ItsMarkWebster . James Corden is in serious danger of becoming the second most famous celebrity West Ham fan in the USA. Surpassing frequent visitor, and thorn in their side, Russell Brand, but failing to crack the number one slot, currently held by the President of their country. So fair enough, I suppose. Corden has pulled off an amazing coup and joined the ranks of US Talk Show hosts. In the recent game of musical frontman chairs, Craig Ferguson gave up his on The Late Late Show, and young James is now set to nestle his rear into place instead. There’s no doubt his celebrated stint on Broadway in ‘One Man, Two Guv’nors’ helped his cause. But it is surely his work from behind a desk at Sky One that has really sealed the deal. A League Of Their Own is currently in its eighth series, and a jewel in the channel’s crown. What’s more, it has gone through a few changes over the years, but now really seems to have hit pay dirt with its team spirit, wacky antics (and less pre-recorded set pieces), and general sense of joie de vivre. Which when you read it, sounds like it might actually be pretty annoying. But in practice, is genuinely a good, knockabout hour of fun. With some sport attached! Kevin Keegan took to Sky 1 show A League Of Their Own with gusto, even when hoisted in mid-air . Freddie Flintoff and Jamie Redknapp take each other on in a Sushi challenge as part of the show . One thing that certainly gets the telly magic happening is quite how much Corden clearly enjoys the company of his two team captains - Freddie Flintoff, and our very own Jamie Redknapp. Freddie, of course, has Jack Whitehall alongside him. Which you’d think would be completely chalk and cheese as a partnership. But actually works more like cheese and onion. And in the green packet. Like it should be. And where these two happily gad about and take it over-the-top, Jamie’s is a more subtle impact. But nonetheless effective for it. First of all, he’s charm itself. When James asked him what he did to prepare for a new series, he drolly replied ‘I do a few comedy clubs’. Young Redknapp may not go in for the thigh slappers, but he’s got a great little comic touch on him. Then he is also clearly popular with co-stars. This manifested itself perfectly on one of the physical rounds, when he and Freddie went head to head in a game of Wasabi Russian Roulette. Or as Jamie decided to play it, spitting sushi into a bucket. In amongst the massive mouthfuls and looks of genuine disgust, our man could be heard continually muttering what could be his new, well, FIRST catchphrase - ‘I don’t like it’. Keegan lubes up comedian Russell Howard before launching him into foam bowling pins. As you do . Redknapp and Keegan give it some welly as they thrust Howard towards the foam bowling pins . Corden, cracking up, said he sounded like his 3 year old son ‘at every meal time’. And I can’t wait to hear him punditing on his next live Sky match when David Jones asks him what he thinks of the game. Please Jamie, tell him ‘I don’t like it’. However, the gracious fella that he is, I’m sure he’d agree he wasn’t the star of this particular show. That title surely belonged to the sporting legend for this episode, Kevin Keegan. A League Of Their Own is never short of big names willing to muck in, and be at the butt end of the jokes in the process. But the little grey-haired fella in the nice crew neck jumper did what he often used to on the pitch, and turned the tables in his favour. The great Fergie rant was shown right at the start of the show. And James exercised his mad DJ skillz playing ‘samples’ of it throughout. The Keegan barnets from across the years were also subject to great scrutiny. As was most of the rest of him in an old photo on the beach, in the flimsiest pair of official England issue trunks. Keegan sang his heart out, much to the enjoyment of team captains Redknapp and Howard . The former England boss gets the audience going as he closes the show with an encore of his single . Which got a good laugh. But when Kevin explained that if you’d trained as hard as they’d made at his club in Germany, Hamburg, ‘you would have a physique like that’. Before turning to James and saying, ‘well, you wouldn’t!’. So happy were Freddie and Jack with this, they had to run across the studio to high five him! But that wasn’t the best of it. Always finish on a song is a good old showbiz adage. And it was Kevin Keegan’s hit from the late Seventies that ultimately brought the house down. An old clip of him performing ‘Head Over Heels’ on a telly show certainly got the audience going. But once Jamie decided to recreate the moment we’d just seen, and had Keegan sing while sitting on his knee, it got positively anthemic. The panelists were up. The crowd was up. Arms were raised overhead, and clapping along occurred as Kevin went for it, a capella. It was a fantastic, spontaneous moment and the kind of thing that has kept this series fresh across the years. James Corden may indeed have a great career as a US talk show host, but he might never have quite as much fun. To paraphrase Jamie, ‘I like it’.

"By . Pa Reporter . Geoffrey Boycott believes an England comeback for Kevin Pietersen is a non-starter because captain Alastair Cook 'can't handle' him. Pietersen's colourful international career was effectively ended in February when the England and Wales Cricket Board dropped its record run-scorer and effectively sacked him from his central contract. Entrenched opinions on both sides mean reconciliation is highly unlikely, while the publication of Pietersen's eagerly anticipated autobiography next month, when a mutually agreed confidentiality clause expires, should settle the matter once and for all. Kevin Pietersen is unlikely to return for England while Alastair Cook is still captain . England's record run taker (R),  playing here for Surrey, was effectively sacked in February . Boycott, himself a former England skiper, agrees there is no way back but suggests one of the key reasons is an inability from Cook to manage his one-time star batsman. Boycott told Radio Five Live: 'They won't consider him again, they won't go back. Whether that's right or wrong I dont know but they're not going to go back, they've made a decision. 'Too many people just feel we don't need it, we don't need the difficulty. 'They know they have enough problems, they don't want any more problems. 'Keeping somebody like Kev, who can give you match-winning performances but can give you headaches, you need a captain who can handle that. Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott claims Cook does not know how to handle Pietersen . 'I'm almost sure in my own mind the current captain can't. Alastair's a nice lad, you couldn't say anything bad about him...but I don't think he can handle someone like Kevin. 'It takes a strong personality and I don't think he is. '(He's) strong in batting, not strong in handling people.' Boycott's fellow Test Match Special commentator Michael Vaughan had a trouble-free relationship with Pietersen when he captained England. Boycott believes that former captain Michael Vaughan (R) would have dealt with Pietersen better . That may have been down to getting the player at the right stage of his career, but Boycott believes he would have dealt with Pietersen better than his latter-day predecessors. 'Michael Vaughan got him at the beginning of his career, it was was much easier because he hadn't become such a big figure in cricket,' added Boycott. 'Michael, if he'd have been captain later on when Kevin became a star, I think would have handled him better because he was a very good captain, an excellent captain.'","Alastair Cook cannot handle Kevin Pietersen, says Geoffrey Boycott .

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Rory McIlroy has joked that he would still be a virgin if it wasn't for his golfing ability. The world number one light-heartedly jested for a television documentary that if he hadn't taken up the sport his luck with women may be different. McIlroy, a four-time major winner, is hoping to lead Europe to Ryder Cup glory against the USA this weekend at Gleneagles and has courted speculation about his private life since his split with ex-fiancee and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in May. Rory McIlroy has joked that he would be a virgin if it wasn't for his golfing skills . The world number one has won the Open (pictured) and the PGA Championship this summer . VIDEO The Open Championship - Final Round highlights . McIlroy is currently preparing for the Ryder Cup as member of the Europe team which starts on Friday . Sasha Gale (left) has recently been romantically linked with McIlroy, who was also falsely rumoured at the same time to have been dating model Nadia Forde (right) Since ditching long-time girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki, 24, as she was planning their wedding in May, McIlroy has been building a reputation as something of a ladies man. The multi-millionaire has revealed that what happened was 'for the best in terms of my golf.' But the 25-year-old was recently romantically linked with receptionist Sasha Gale, who is from Lisburn, County Antrim, a city just the other side of Belfast from where he grew up. Prior to that, he was spotted out with model Nadia Forde, fuelling speculation they were an item. Pictures taken from outside the hotel showed him cuddling up to one brunette wearing a white bodycon dress.And more recently, McIlroy was last month seen out in Manchester as he and a friend joined a group of pretty women at the Lowry hotel at 3am after a Saturday night out. McIlroy split from his former fiancée tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki in May . McIlroy's quip about his virginity was borrowed from Stoke footballer Peter Crouch (right) McIlroy's latest comment about his relationships with women came as he spoke alongside fellow Northern Irish Major champions Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell for a documentary to be shown on BBC2 on Thursday. In a sneak peak seen by The Sun, he also told how his growing fame forces him to put a 'shield up' when he is out in public. McIlroy's 'virgin' joke was, of course, not original.

It is only the second time in history a US president has chaired the council. At the start of the meeting, Mr Abbott threw Australia's support behind a US-drafted resolution mandating a global crackdown on foreign fighters. The legally binding resolution passed unanimously, winning support from all 15 UNSC members. He expressed regret that dozens of Australians had succumbed to the IS 'delusion' but made it clear the government would not go easy on them. 'The Australian government will be utterly unflinching towards anything that threatens our future as a free, fair and multicultural society,' he said.

'Our goal is not to change people but to protect them; it's not to change governments but to combat terrorism,' he said. Despite the dark times, there were grounds for hope: not least the all-but-universal revulsion that IS's crimes had generated around the world. 'Perhaps the realisation is now dawning for all peoples, all cultures and all faiths that it can never be right to kill in the name of God. 'That would be a moral victory far surpassing any military success.'

Sierra Leone's proposed countrywide 'lockdown' will not help control an Ebola outbreak and could lead to the disease spreading further as cases are concealed, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) claimed today. The government plans to order citizens not to leave the areas around their homes for three days from September 19 in a bid to prevent new infections and help health workers track down people suffering from the disease, the information ministry also said today. 'It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola as they end up driving people underground and jeopardising the trust between people and health providers,' said MSF.

The words 'die' and 'Muslims are evil and have no respect for our ways' were spray-painted on the mosque in southern Brisbane - the second Muslim prayer site to be defaced in Queensland in less than a week. Muslim community leaders and police were alerted to the vandalism at the Rocklea mosque on Wednesday evening and a police forensic team has begun an investigation. Scroll down for video . Vandals graffitied hate-filled messages on an Indonesian community mosque in Rocklea in Brisbane . Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart called for calm and tolerance in response to growing concerns over the threat posed by the terrorist group Islamic State . A mosque spokesman said the community was saddened by the attack but that it would clean up the mess and move on. 'This is a sad day not just for our community but for all Australians,' spokesman Febi Dwirahmadi said. 'This abhorrent act is not representing the real Australian. We call for all communities to calm down. 'We will not be destroyed by this. It makes us more resilient. We are all Australians and we must all come together and call for calm right across the globe.' Islamic Indonesian Community of Queensland president Hamid Mawardi praised police for their quick response to the attack on the Rocklea mosque, the ABC reported. Mr Mawardi said he had no idea who had vandalised the mosque but that it was 'probably just kids'. 'I think this is a misperception about Islam – we are here, Australian,' he said. 'I've been here for years and we live nice and peacefully and whoever did this – respect us as Australians.' The latest incident comes just five days after a mosque at Mareeba in far north Queensland was vandalised with the word 'evil' spray-painted across it on Friday . Mareeba mayor Tom Gilmore told AAP the prayer site had been part of the area since the 1950s and the Muslim members were a 'highly respected' part of the community. The attack on the mosque did not reflect the attitudes of the wider community, he added. On Wednesday afternoon, Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart called for calm and tolerance in response to growing concerns over the threat posed by the terrorist group Islamic State. He was speaking after an incident in Melbourne on Tuesday night where a man who was under investigation was shot dead by police in Melbourne, and after a number of counter-terrorism raids occurred in Sydney and south of Brisbane in recent weeks. Mr Stewart said he had met with leaders in the Brisbane Muslim community and told them police would go out of their way to ensure their safety, the ABC reported. 'Whilst it is our strong view that this [terrorism] is not religiously based or culturally based, the perception may be in some quarters that the Muslim community have some ties to the perpetrators of some of these crimes,' he said. 'They are simply people who have no respect for any of us or for any particular religion or religious group.' He said police would be hiring four more Muslim police liaison officers to help improve communication with the community.","Vandals scrawled hate-filled messages on a mosque in southern Brisbane .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . McLaren team principal Eric Boullier has accused Red Bull of using coded radio messages to help Daniel Ricciardo in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. A complicated week in the build-up to the race for the FIA saw them initially issue a detailed list of messages that would be prohibited from the race in Singapore onwards. Motor sport's world governing body, however, backtracked on several of the guidelines following complaints from teams. McLaren team principle Eric Boullier has accused Red Bull of using coded radio messages . With difficulties still being posed by the highly complex technical systems and power units employed this year, the FIA relaxed their stance on that matter. But any form of coaching advice, such as where a driver was losing time, where to brake, how to corner quicker et cetera, remained banned. During the race at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, and with Daniel Ricciardo encountering problems with the battery in his car, at one stage he was told: 'Avoiding exit kerbs may help the problem with the car.' Boullier feels such a message contravened the new regulations as he said: 'We had no issues (with the new radio rules) on our side. Boullier believes Red Bull used coded messages to help Daniel Ricciardo in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix . 'It just made us more busy listening to others to make sure they made no mistakes, like Red Bull twice with Ricciardo. 'I think it was coded, but it is up to the FIA to investigate. It is not for me to investigate. 'But it was a strange message. Once was okay, but twice, three times? You can doubt what exactly the car problem was.' Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has confirmed discussions were conducted with FIA race director Charlie Whiting during the grand prix to clarify matters. Daniel Ricciardo claimed a third place finish behind Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton on Sunday . With Ricciardo going on to finish third, Horner said: 'The problem started relatively early, probably before half distance, where we had basically an issue with the battery not discharging. 'There was quite a lot of management that needed to go on to help him with that. It was quite intermittent, the problem we had. 'If there had been a full radio ban it wouldn't have made life easier, that's for sure. 'We spoke to Charlie, we told him he's got some reliability issues and that was why he was told to keep off the kerbs because that was causing damage to the battery for instance. 'It's finding that balance with this radio stuff.'

The Australian reports Mr Rudd described his toppling in June, 2010 as a 'shakespearean' plot line riddled with falsehoods about his government's performance, Labor's election chances and the notion a coup was in the 'national interest'. He believes those excuses were designed to mask Ms Gillard's overconfident ambition. The blistering submission from Mr Rudd came in response to arguments by Ms Gillard and her supporters, there was a change in leadership needed. 'This was an entirely fabricated post-facto rationale for a leadership change that was driven in large part by political ambition, an attempt to elevate the reasons for leadership change above crude politics to the highest reasons of state,' said Mr Rudd.

"By . Leesa Smith . and Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . The owner of a Sydney convenience store which caught fire, killing three people, deliberately planned the explosion with a 'complex' set-up of fuel containers so that he could collect on the insurance pay-out, police will allege. Adeel Khan, who was charged on Tuesday with the murder of three people living upstairs from his Rozelle business, demonstrated 'disregard for human life' as he deliberately set his business ablaze on September 4, court documents claim. Police will allege he deliberately' and 'dishonestly' started the inferno. 'It (is) the belief of police that the accused intentionally set about to destroy his business by fire,' the statement of facts says. 'The intent when doing so was to make a financial claim against his insurance.' Scroll down for video . Adeel Khan, 44, was charged with three counts of murder in hospital over the fire explosion in Rozelle - Sydney's inner west - that killed three people . Emergency services were called to a fire explosion at a convenience store on Darling Street on September 4 . Police will allege Khan knew Bianka O'Brien and her one-year-old son Jude, along with their 27-year-old Chris Noble, who all died in the fire, and he was aware that the building's only entry and exit was via the rear driveway. 'The accused acted to cause the explosion and subsequent fire during early hours of the morning when it could only be expected that the above residents would be at home and at their most vulnerable whilst asleep,' court papers said. 'The very act of setting even a small fire in the circumstances demonstrated the accused disregard for human life.' Court documents say baby Jude woke early on the morning of the fire. His parents comforted him and put him back to sleep. Ms O'Brien later told her husband, John, it smelt as if someone was spray-painting in their driveway. John then decided to go to work early, and left about 3.30am before the explosion erupted about half an hour later. Forensic examiners allegedly found what police described as a 'complex and elaborate set-up' of petrol fuel loads throughout Khan's shop, office and storeroom. Plastic fuel containers were found placed at various points throughout the rubble 'connected by lengths of material cut into strips and tied together', police will allege. One was connected to a rechargeable 6V battery and adjacent from this was 'a number of AA batteries stuck together and joined to the larger battery by lengths of wire.' Reports claim wife Naima Adeel (right) was worried about her husband's (left) unusual disappearance from their home in south-west Sydney at 4am - the morning the shop on Darling Street burnt to the ground . Forensic tests later claim to have detected petrol on Khan's clothes and shoes, and police allege to have found a carbon-fibre breathing mask in the pocket of his trousers. Plastic fuel containers were found inside milk crates similar to those seen via CCTV footage being filled up by Khan at a Croydon Park petrol station just three days before the fire on September 1, it has been alleged. Police found a receipt for 38.82 litres of petrol, and also a further 7.28 litres, during a search warrant of Khan’s home in Greenacre, the report states. Police also claim that Khan's car – a black Rav 4 - was found unlocked with the keys in the ignition in the rear driveway of the shop with a 10 litre fuel container full of petrol. Khan's version of events differ from the police documents as he told officers he was held up by three robbers at 11.30pm the night before the blaze which happened at about 4am. He said one bought a packet of cigarettes while another produced a handgun ordering him to lock up the shop and turn off the lights as a third offender arrived. He told police he was put in the storeroom and his hands were loosely bound by garbage bags, and his eyes were also covered by a bag. During the next four hours Khan said the thieves stole $3,000 in cash from his pocket, his wallet, mobile phone and between $1,500 - $1,700 from the cash register. Then the offenders snacked on sandwiches and drinks from the shop. He said five to ten minutes after the offenders eventually left the store, he fled to his car when the explosion went off. Detectives from NSW Police at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown, Sydney's inner west, where Adeel Khan was arrested . A police vehicle parked outside the hospital where Mr Khan was admitted after he was rescued from the fire in Rozelle . However, shortly after the blast, paramedics allege when they questioned Khan to assess his level of consciousness that he repeatedly responded saying : 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it, I'm so sorry.' Emergency workers had to extricate Khan, who was trapped under the commercial drinks fridge, after seeing his hand sticking out from the rubble. Police will allege a cigarette lighter was found nearby. Paperwork seized during the search warrant of Khan's house 'revealed signs of financial distress' detailing a disconnection notice by AGL for being in arrears of $3,435 for a bill which had a due date of August 25, police allege. The police will also claim that Khan told his real estate that he would pay his monthly rent of $8,800 on the day that the fire occurred - although it was due three days before on September 1. The documents state that Khan increased his insurance for the shop's stock and interior in February, and then again in May, to the current value of $225,000. Police claim Khan said his business was in 'direct competition' with the larger IGA supermarket, which was only 60-70 metres away, and also 'surrounding specialty food outlets.' Bianka O'Brien and one-year-old son Jude were killed in the fatal inferno earlier this month . It has also been reported that when the Pakistan Consul visited Khan in hospital, the shop owner said the blast was started by a gas cylinder. Daily Telegraph reports than Mr Khan told the consul member: 'I didn't do anything. I don't know what happened, I am very upset.' 'I have sympathy with the people who lost their lives.' However reports claim his wife  was worried about her husband's unusual disappearance from their home in south-west Sydney at 4am - the morning the shop on Darling Street was destroyed in the fatal explosion. A close friend revealed Naima Adeel was concerned when she discovered her husband wasn't at their Greenacre home and tried to reach him on his phone a number of times. Days after the fire rocked the close-knit community, neighbours told media outlets that Mr Khan usually closed his store at midnight and reopened it at 7am. Rozelle businesses say it was unusual for Mr Khan who wasn't often seen behind the counter of his business, to be at the shop that early as it doesn't open until about 7am. But Ms Adeel, who has been questioned by police over the fatal fire at Rozelle, has also dismissed allegations her husband was involved and labelled them as 'rumours'. At a bedside hearing on Tuesday, Khan was charged with 25 offences, including three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, three counts of manslaughter. He also faces 17 charges related to property damage including one of setting a fire for a financial gain. He was refused bail and will face Central Local Court on October 21. Chris Noble (pictured), 27, was also killed in the fire explosion which also injured three others, including shop owner Adeel Khan .

If a staff member notices a pupil eating preservative-laden treats - the parent is pulled aside to discuss healthier alternative options for their child at a school in Sydney's lower north shore. The friendly reminders have not ruffled any feathers among the parents and has resulted in children showing off their new healthier snacks in the school yard. Scroll down for video . Teachers have a friendly chat with parents if students are seen eating junk food from their lunchboxes . North Sydney Demonstration School principal Myra Wearne said the initiative was a way to ensure that students reach their learning potential. 'Our parents trust us to know that we want what is best for their children, and a high-sugar diet is anything but,' Mrs Wearne told Mosman Daily. 'If we see a student with a chocolate bar or a packet of chips in their lunchbox, we will have a personal conversation with the student's parents to remind them that these foods are not suitable and recommend healthy ­alternatives.' Rebecca Nash has three children at the Waverton school and although she hasn't been pulled up on her children's lunchbox contents, she said she wouldn't be insulted if it did occur. 'They say it takes a community to raise a child, and I think that's very true,' Mrs Nash said. 'It starts in the home because that's where children first learn about making healthy choices but it is for teachers to extend on and reinforce.' The NSW education department stipulates that all public school canteens in NSW must colour code their menus: red means 'occasionally', amber is 'select carefully' and green for 'fill the menu'. But this policy does not include food that is brought from home. The new initiative has students showing off their healthy snacks in the school yard at North Sydney Demonstration School . Nutrition educator and mother-of-one Lynsey Bradley, who runs workshops to help parents with healthy lunchbox ideas, said educating parents about nutrition is essential for their kids' bodies and minds. 'The more emphasis a school puts on healthy eating the better,' Mrs Bradley said. 'Parents play a huge part in their child's wellbeing and I find a lot of the time they don't know what they are doing wrong.' She emphasised that preservatives, added sugar and high salt levels and the 'energy spikes' created by such ingredients was the biggest issue. 'Obviously there is no problem with your child having a treat but I always encourage parents to try making their own,' she said. 'Homemade banana bread or blueberry muffins are perfect.'

"By . Margot Peppers for MailOnline . An 11-year-old who fought and survived cancer three years ago has made it her mission to help other kids fighting the disease. Kylie Simonds, from Naugatuck, Connecticut, was just eight when she was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare bone and soft tissue cancer, and she says the heavy IV pole she had to cart around during chemo sessions made the whole experience harder and scarier. So the savvy tween came up with a solution: an IV backpack specially designed to accommodate a pump for chemotherapy or transfusions. Scroll down for video . Genius invention: Cancer survivor Kylie Simonds, 11, from Naugatuck, Connecticut, has invented an IV backpack that makes it easier and less scary for kids to be hooked up to the IV during chemo . The perfect solution: She says the heavy IV poles she had to cart around during chemo sessions made the whole experience harder and more daunting . The backpack began as a school project that required her to solve an everyday problem; for Kylie, the standard issue IV pole was her own personal everyday issue to overcome. 'It was really scary for me at a young age, which was eight,' she told MSNBC. 'I had to use the big IV poles which were actually really heavy to push around and they had lots of wires and tubes I would trip over or get tangled in.' To combat these setbacks, Kylie designed a backpack which is fitted with the IV pole on the top corner of the bag. A wire protector around the IV sack ensures that it won't pop if you lean on it, and the medical machine goes inside the bag. Instead of the clinical white and metal pole patients normally use, Kylie's backpack is pink and Hello Kitty-themed, making it even less threatening to children with cancer. And since it straps onto your back, it allows young patients to play and do activities to distract themselves while undergoing chemo. Kid-friendly: Kylie's backpack is fitted with the IV pole on the top corner of the bag. A wire protector around the IV sack ensures that it won't pop if you lean on it, and the medical machine goes inside the bag . After 46 weeks of chemotherapy and several surgeries, Kylie was confirmed cancer-free two years ago, and now she's focusing on helping others. Now, thanks to all the attention she has received for her invention, Kylie hopes to actually get her prototype made so she can provide it to children and hospitals everywhere.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A 'beer card' has been created which allows punters to purchase their favourite tipple at a discount. The pre-paid beer credit card has been produced by German brewers Kolsch and allows drinkers to buy 22 glasses of the beverage for just 25 Euros - or £19. Manager Alex Strieder, 29, said: 'We wanted to create something that would reach similar cult status to the football club season ticket. The pre-paid beer credit card has been produced by German brewers Kolsch . 'That is what gave us the idea of the typical Kolsch glass as a symbol. 'This led on to the pubs and the idea to save some money with the use of a card. 'If customers are loyal to us, we'll be loyal to them and keep prices down. 'It's safer than using cash too. Who would mug someone for a glass of beer?' Drinkers can top up their card with credit before a night out and use it instead of cash or credit cards at pubs that have signed up to the scheme. The beer credit card allows drinkers to buy 22 glasses of the beverage for just 25 Euros - or £19 . Petra Zemljic, 53, a landlady in Cologne, western Germany, said: 'We're delighted with the idea. 'Anything that makes the drinking environment easier and smoother is good for us and good for customers. Drinker Dennis Mahler, 23, also welcomed the initiative. He said: 'All I have to bring is one little card. It means cheaper beer and I don't have to remember my wallet.","The beer credit card has been produced by German brewers, Kolsch .

"By . Steve Doughty for the Daily Mail . Homework: Children whose parents did badly at school are much more likely than others to fail at school themselves, according to new research . Children are held back in life by bad education rather than a poverty-stricken home, a major state study found yesterday. It said that children whose parents did badly at school are much more likely than others to fail at school themselves, and end up working in low-paid jobs or not working at all. But coming from a home with a low income has by itself no influence on how well a child does, the analysis said. The findings from the Office for National Statistics were produced in an attempt to explain why social mobility – the chances of a child being better off than his or her parents – has fallen in Britain over the past four decades. They provide powerful new support for the argument that the failure of children from working class and low-income homes to rise to take high-quality jobs with high earnings is rooted in the education system. However they appear to undermine the claims of poverty-lobby organisations and supporting politicians who claim that poverty and deprivation do the most damage to the chances of children. The report on ‘Intergenerational Transmission of Disadvantage’ was designed to guide politicians to the most important factors in childhood that lead children from poor families into poverty as adults. It said that the educational level of parents had the biggest impact on how well children are educated themselves, on whether they are likely to grow up to live on low incomes, and on whether they will be able to afford to pay their rent, heat their home, eat well or take holidays. Children whose father had a low level of education were seven-and-a-half-times more likely to have a poor education themselves than children with a well-educated father, the study said. A child of a poorly-educated mother was three times more likely to fail at school themselves than a child of a well-educated mother. Children with poorly educated parents were five times more likely to be poor adults than children of well-educated parents. And children of poorly-educated parents were 11 times more likely to be ‘severely deprived’ as adults than children of well-educated parents. A family is considered to be severely deprived if it cannot afford four out of nine basic expenses. These are paying the rent or the mortgage; keeping the house warm; being able to meet an unexpected bill; eating meat or protein regularly; having a week’s holiday; and having a television, a washing machine, a car or a phone. But the study found that growing up in a poor home had no effect on whether someone was poor as an adult. ‘The individual’s assessment of their childhood financial situation is not a significant predictor of poverty once educational attainment is accounted for,’ it said. ‘This suggests that household income during childhood mainly impacts future life chances through the educational attainment of the child..’ It added: ‘There is no evidence of a relationship between severe material deprivation now and the financial situation of the household as a child once education is controlled for.’ The findings, the analysis said, are ‘consistent with previous research indicating that income itself is not the primary driver of poverty persisting through the generations.’ However, the ONS said that one other factor that did affect a child’s life chances was whether or not he or she was brought up by a single parent. Children growing up with a single parent are one and a half times more likely to do badly at school than those with two parents. The findinds provide powerful new support for the argument that the failure of children from working class and low-income homes to rise to take high-quality jobs with high earnings is rooted in the education system . The findings were gathered from the EU-SILC survey carried out by the EU’s statistics arm in 2011. Eurostat questioned 13,500 adults in Britain about what their homes were like when they were 14. In all, the survey covered more than 200,000 people across Europe. The findings come at a time of deep controversy over social mobility and how to increase it. This week the Labour Party responded to evidence that a high proportion of people in professional and well-paid jobs were educated in independent schools with a proposal that in future all public sector organisations should be made to publish information on the class backgrounds of employees. Charities and pressure groups have been blaming poverty for the lack of social mobility in Britain. Oxfam, for example maintains that Government policies favour the super-rich and ‘decrease social mobility, increase poverty and create economic instability’. It wants to see higher minimum wages, higher taxation of the better-off, and more spending on public services. However the ONS report is likely to give ammunition to Tories who want to see the re-establishment of the grammar schools that once gave a top-class education to selected children from working-class homes. Supporters of grammar schools point to the evidence that social mobility began to decline in the 1980s, following the abolition of most grammars. In 2011 a large-scale independent study found that children with better-educated parents begin to forge ahead of others after they have left primary school and gone on to secondary school education.","ONS research finds father's ability holds key to a child's success as school .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . The former executive director of JBWere has claimed she was sexually harassed and intimidated into leaving her position after falling pregnant. Toni Thornton from Queensland has claimed $4.5 million dollars from the company in compensation for the harassment. Federal court documents reveal that when Ms Thornton notified her supervisor at the time, Paul Heath, that she was pregnant in February of 2009 he said that: 'in his experience a woman's IQ halves when she falls pregnant'. Scroll down for video . Toni Thornton, the former executive director of JBWere has claimed $4.5 million after being allegedly sexually harassed while being pregnant . Three months later, Ms Thornton claims Mr Heath instructed her to turn around before saying: 'Yup, you are having a boy because your bum has blown out'. Mr Heath went on to become the chief executive of JBWere but was made redundant after the company was bought by National Australia Bank, according to Fairfax. His attempt to sue the company for a payout was dismissed by the Fair Work Commission when he was found to overvalue his own abilities. The mother-of-two said in her statement of claim that she was penalised for taking time off of work and choosing to work part time after her pregnancies by being given higher targets than her colleagues but receiving smaller bonuses. After returning to work following her first pregnancy in 2010, she was only given a $20,000 bonus which was then again reduced by 20 per cent due to her working less hours, despite being given up to $150,000 in previous years. Ms Thornton (left) claims her former supervisor, Paul Heath (right), asked her to turn around while pregnant before saying: 'you are having a boy because your bum has blown out' When informing her colleague Steve Marino that she planned to take maternity leave again after falling pregnant with a second child, she alleges that he told her he was 'pissed off, frustrated' and said he 'no longer wished to share clients'. Staff at human resources instructed her to ignore the incident, Ms Thornton claimed. However, when she again resumed her position at JBWere in July 2013 following her second round of maternity leave, she claims her client base had been slashed by 33 per cent and she was constantly asked by staff: 'do you really want to come back to work?' Both JBWere in Brisbane (pictured) and Ms Thornton have been contacted for comment by Daily Mail Australia . Both JBWere and Ms Thornton have been contacted for comment by Daily Mail Australia. A NAB spokesperson on Thornton Case told Daily Mail Australia: 'We do not comment on matters before the courts. However we deny these allegations and will vigorously defend the case'.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A schoolboy who was banned from becoming a Boy Scout has won a landmark legal ruling against the group. Clare and Barry Coyne were left devastated when their autistic son Thomas,11, was refused admission to the Scouts after four years in the younger Beaver and Cubs group. Now after a legal battle against leaders of the 36th Sheffield Scouts Thomas has won £5,000 in compensation - and his parents hope to raise awareness to stop other youngsters suffering the same problem. Clare Coyne (pictured) says she was ‘shocked and hurt’ to be told Thomas would not be allowed to move into Scouts when she tried to register him for a camping trip in July last year . Mrs Coyne says she was ‘shocked and hurt’ to be told Thomas would not be allowed to move into Scouts when she tried to register him for a camping trip in July last year. Mr and Mrs Coyne, who volunteered for Cub committees and accompanied their son to sessions, were told their child posed a ‘significant health and safety risk to other Scouts and himself’. She said: 'I couldn’t believe the Scout leader at the time was refusing Thomas a place, based on an assumption because of his disability. 'It was only when I was registering Thomas to attend the trip that the leader delivered the news. 'He then emailed me back saying Thomas couldn’t progress to Scouts or attend the camping trip, because ""he lacks independence"". 'To be told, with no prior discussion, that he was not progressing to Scouts with his friends was devastating. 'I was also shocked and hurt to receive the news by email - especially after acting as parent rep for the group.' A Scout Association spokesman vowed that the organisation would 'take on board any lessons learned in this case' The Scout leader and a district commissioner then asked Mrs Coyne, 44, from Fulwood, Sheffield, for an apology when she made an official complaint of disability discrimination. She added: 'Thomas enjoyed four happy years at Ranmoor Beavers and Cubs. He didn’t cause any problems whatsoever. 'My child is gorgeous, not violent or aggressive. His former leaders had discussed Thomas’ needs with us, but the Scout leader didn’t - and wouldn’t back down on his decision. 'When he started at Beavers he could say about seven words and now he’s this articulate, funny, happy boy. It helped him so much. 'He is in special needs education and even though it is amazing, this allowed him to make friends near his home and do something in his own community. 'The whole family were very much involved with both groups, my 13-year-old daughter is a member of the same Scouts. I couldn’t believe they chose to tell me via email. They didn’t try and explain why, or have a discussion with us. It was horrific after four very happy years. 'We faced huge legal costs if we lost, but I felt a duty to fight this for other children out there.' Mrs Coyne sought legal advice from Sheffield Citizens’ Advice and Law Centre. The action was later settled before the case went to county court and the Scout Association paid £5,000 in compensation, which will be held by the court until Thomas is aged 18. Thomas has since taken up a place at the 79th St Timothy’s Scout Group in Sheffield, but Mrs Coyne says Thomas has already missed out despite moving to another group. She said: 'The financial compensation can’t replace the friendships and experiences Thomas has missed. 'We want to be lessons to be learned to avoid another family going through the distress that we have experienced.' Scout Association spokesman Simon Carter said: 'We do intend to take on board any lessons learned in this case. 'Our volunteer team is passionate about making sure we offer scouting to as many young people as possible whatever their needs.'","Thomas Coyne wins ruling after being banned from becoming a Boy Scout .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . Dior's new foundation has been designed to capture natural light on the face . Almost 70 per cent of women feel their skin looks dull, . lacks radiance or features unsightly dark shadows or redness when they see themselves in photographs or 'selfies' on social media. Just over 40 per cent admit they look to their foundation to give them confidence when they're photographed. The research from Dior marks the launch of their new titanium-rich foundation, which the brand say makes users feel instantly more photogenic. Called Diorskin Star, their new foundation is said to help women take the perfect selfie. It has been designed to capture natural light on the face and enhance the cheekbones and eyes while banishing dull skin, shine and wrinkles. Scientists spent two years developing a formula containing 'intelligent pigments' which help diffuse natural and artificial light over the skin. The light bursting technology stops redness and shininess while 'amplifying radiance', according to the French cosmetics firm. Dior claims its new foundation, Diorskin Star, makes users look instantly more photo-ready without the need for hours in front of the mirror. This is supposedly down to the make-up's titanium-enriched silica beads, which 'neutralise imperfections in colour and texture and correct unevenness'. The £32 foundation was tested under everyday conditions and then in a photographic studio using camera flash guns. Diorskin Star has now been launched with Hollywood beauty Natalie Portman the face of the foundation. Carlos . Ferraz, a make-up artists for the likes of Mila Kunis and Eva Mendes, . said: 'We now live in a digital age and, as everyone is a photographer, . it is important our makeup is camera ready. 'Diorskin . Star is perfect for bringing a good coverage with dewy, luminous and . healthy looking skin - a great photogenic foundation.'

A liquorice extract improves microcirculation, preventing a build-up of hemoglobin and resulting redness close to the surface of the face. Edouard Mauvais-Jarvis, scientific communications director at Dior, added: 'Our specialist researchers who are experts in skin and the optical behaviour of cosmetic ingredients worked for two years to find a way to utilise titanium in a cosmetic way. 'Our objective was to make the face an ideal light source, emitting the largest amount of the purest light to be luminous. 'When light reaches the skin, only 10-15 per cent of the rays are reflected while the rest is absorbed. The more the light is backscattered, the more the skin is luminous. 'We have developed an industry first with the introduction of titanium-enriched silica beads which enables Diorskin Star foundation to release maximum light reflecting potential.'

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . It is one of the oddest moons in the solar system. Miranda, a small, icy moon of Uranus, is covered in giant fault canyons 12 times as deep as the Grand Canyon, giving it a unique look leading to it being called a 'Frankenstein moon'. Now, researchers say they have finally discovered why it looks so unusual. A mosaic of high-resolution Voyager 2 images of Miranda, the 'Frankenstein moon' of Uranus. One wide-angle and eight narrow-angle camera images of Miranda were combined in this view to show off the bizarre deformed surface. At about 500 km in diameter, Miranda is only one-seventh as large as Earth's moon. It sports one of the strangest and most varied landscapes among extraterrestrial bodies, including three large features known as 'coronae,' which are unique among known objects in our solar system. They are lightly cratered collections of ridges and valleys, separated from the more heavily cratered (and presumably older) terrain by sharp boundaries like mismatched patches on a moth-eaten coat. Miranda's giant fault canyons are as much as 12 times as deep as the Grand Canyon. Due to Miranda's low gravity and large cliffs, a rock dropped off the edge of the highest cliff would take a full 10 minutes to reach the foot of the cliff. All of Uranus' larger moons, including Miranda, are thought to consist mostly of roughly equal amounts of water ice and silicate rock. Despite its relatively small size, Miranda appears to have experienced an episode of intense resurfacing that resulted in the formation of at least three remarkable and unique surface features -- polygonal-shaped regions called coronae. These coronae are visible in Miranda's southern hemisphere, and each one is at least 200 km across. Arden corona, the largest, has ridges and troughs with up to 2 km of relief. Elsinore corona has an outer belt that is approx. 80 km wide, relatively smooth, and elevated above the surrounding terrain by approx. 100m. Inverness corona has a trapezoidal shape with a large, bright chevron at its center. The giant fault canyons are as much as 12 times as deep as the Grand Canyon. Due to Miranda's low gravity and large cliffs, a rock dropped off the edge of the highest cliff would take a full 10 minutes to reach the foot of the cliff. All of Uranus' larger moons, including Miranda, are thought to consist mostly of roughly equal amounts of water ice and silicate rock. Voyager 2 image of Miranda taken shortly before closest approach on 24 January 1986 at a range of 19,000 miles. Miranda's giant fault canyons are as much as 12 times as deep as the Grand Canyon. The northern hemisphere of Miranda was never imaged by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, so it is unknown whether additional coronae exist. Using numerical models, Noah Hammond and Amy Barr from Brown proved that convection in Miranda's ice mantle likely formed the coronae. 'During convection, warm buoyant ice rose toward the surface, driving concentric surface extension beneath the locations of the coronae, causing the formation of extensional tectonic faults. 'This style of resurfacing is similar to plate tectonics on Earth, in that convection is a primary driving force for surface deformation,' they wrote. Hammond and Barr write that the internal energy that powered convection probably came from tidal heating. Tidal heating would have occurred when Miranda was in an eccentric orbit -- moving closer to and further from Uranus. This caused the tidal forces from Uranus to vary, periodically stretching and squeezing Miranda and generating heat in its ice shell.","Miranda is a small icy moon of Uranus .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . and Associated Press . A Roman Catholic schoolteacher who claims she was fired by a nothern Indiana diocese for trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertlization, will have her day in court. U.S. District Judge Robert L Miller Jr ruled this week that former St Vincent de Paul school teacher Emily Herx deserves a chance to prove that she was terminated by the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend based on sex discrimination. This issue 'is whether Mrs. Herx was nonrenewed because of her sex, or because of a sincere belief (by the diocese) about the morality of in vitro fertilization,' Miller wrote in the 29-page ruling issued Wednesday . Emily Herx (left) claims she was fired as a teacher from a Catholic school in 2011, for undergoing in vitro fertility treatments to get pregnant with her husband Brian (right). A district court judge ruled this week that the case can go to trial . Herx, of Hoagland, Indiana, sued the diocese in April 2012, alleging that her firing by the diocese violated the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against her based on gender and on infertility, which is considered a disability. The 34-year-old taught literature and language arts at the school from 2003 - 2011. Bishop Kevin Rhodes allegedly told Herx that the fertility treatment was 'an intrinsic evil' Herx spoke about her firing when she first filed the lawsuit. Appearing on the Today Show, Herx and her husband recalled how  they were first encouraged to try in vitro when after their first child was born, doctors told Herx she wouldn't be able to get pregnant naturally again. She says she was straightforward with her employers, telling the school's principal that she was going to try in vitro and would need time off for the treatments. He allegedly granted the time off and said: 'You are in my prayers'. But when she asked for more time off in May 2011, for a second round of in vitro, Herx was told to report to Msgr John Kuzmich, the pastor of the St Vincent de Paul Catholic Church. According to court documents, Msgr Kuzmich called Herx a 'grave, immoral sinner' and that if news of the IVF treatments got out, it would cause a 'scandal' for the church. The Catholic Church has long disapproved of these fertility treatments because additional embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy, and are sometimes destroyed  when one egg takes. Herx then appealed to Bishop Kevin Rhodes, assuring him that no embryos were destroyed in her individual treatment. But that meeting was just as negative, with Bishop Rhodes saying: 'The process of in vitro fertilization very frequently involves the deliberate destruction or freezing of human embryos. 'In vitro fertilization...is an intrinsic evil, which means that no circumstances can justify it.' In his decision this week, Miller denied Herx's claim that she was fired for her infertility, rather than the treatment itself, which is banned under Catholic doctrine. 'The Diocese appears to be exactly right: all the evidence in the record indicates that the Diocese acted because of Mrs. Herx's choice of fertility treatment and not on any animus against infertility,' he wrote. Part of Herx's complaint on the sex discrimination issue was that men play a different role in the procedure and if it is successful, they don't become pregnant, said Christopher Stake, one of the attorneys who represented Herx. Herx taught literature and language arts at the St Vincent de Paul School (pictured) from 2003 to 2011 . The diocese has argued that the policy against in vitro fertilization treats men and women the same. But Miller said a jury might not accept that argument. 'The Diocese hasn't terminated any men for participation in this (or any other) infertility treatment,' he noted. Also in the ruling, Miller spurned the diocese's argument that, as a religious organization, it is protected from Herx's claims. Religious employers are not immune to federal laws against sex discrimination, he wrote. Miller also disagreed with the diocese's claim that Herx was a lay 'minister' in the church, and therefore her termination was protected by the federal ministerial exception, which gives religious organizations leeway in the treatment of their ministers. 'Nothing in the summary judgment record suggests that Mrs. Herx was a member of the clergy of the Catholic Church,' he wrote, adding that she was considered by the principal to be a 'lay teacher.' Stake said if Herx prevails at trial on the sex discrimination claim, she can still receive the damages she seeks, such as back pay, even though the judge dismissed her disability claim. The Associated Press left a phone message Friday seeking comment from the diocese's attorney. In vitro fertilization, or IVF, involves mixing egg and sperm in a laboratory dish and transferring a resulting embryo into the womb. The couple talked about Herx's firing when they first filed a lawsuit against the diocese in April 2012, appearing on the Today Show .","Emily Herx, 34, claims she was fired from her position as a teacher at the St Vincent de Paul School for undergoing IVF .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Gaming has long been seen as the preserve of boys staring intently at glowing screens, while their girlfriends, arms crossed, look on disapprovingly. But this old stereotype is beginning to change, with new figures showing that there are now more women than men involved in gaming. The trend has been driven by 25 to 44-year-old women downloading free puzzle and trivia game apps on smartphones, a recent report claims. More women are now gaming than men, according to a new study. The trend has been driven by 25-44 year old women downloading free puzzle and trivia game apps on smartphones, a recent report claims . The research, undertaken by the Internet Advertising Bureau UK (IAB), revealed that women account for more than half of people who have played some form of video game in the last six months. Overall, the gamer audience in the UK has now hit 33.5 million, which accounts for 69 per cent of the population, it said. From that pool, more people over 44 years old playing games than children and teenagers. The over 44s make up 27 per cent of the gamer population and children and teenagers make up 22. Meanwhile, a third of 65 to 74-year-olds have played a video game in the last six months. Six in ten games used in the last six months were free and apps are now the most popular video game format played by 55 per cent of the online population. More people over 44 years old playing games than children and teenagers. The over 44s make up 27 per cent of the gamer population and children and teenagers make up 22 . One third of respondents said trivia and puzzles were their favourite game genre. Action, adventure and shooter games are the next favourite, cited by 18 per cent of all respondents, rising to 45 per cent of 16 to 24 year old males and 26 per cent of men 25 to 44 . As a result, smartphones are now the most popular device for playing games, cited by 54 per cent of people who took the survey. 'The internet and mobile devices have changed the gaming landscape forever,' says Steve Chester, Director of Data and Industry Programmes at the Internet Advertising Bureau. Separate research by social media network Pixwoo.com found that the average gamer, who will spend up to 12 hours a week glued to their console, is actually 35-years-old and married, and earns £23,000 a year. But researchers found that the hobby isn't always good news for relationships, with the average gamer rowing with their partner twice a week over their pastime. More than one in twenty of those in relationships say it is a constant source of their rows while 15 per cent have broken up with someone because of it. Around three quarters even admitted they don't think they will ever grow out of their love for computer games. 'They've brought down the barriers to entry, making gaming far more accessible and opened it up to a whole new audience.

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . They say cats have nine lives. But mother-of three Lucia Cassidy has proved she has 29. Mrs Cassidy's heart stopped a total of 29 times in just 24 hours due to a rare condition, but she has now recovered has begun competing in fitness competitions. A busy life looking after three children Gerard, 8, Tyson, 6 and Jayden, 5 meant Mrs Cassidy often forgot to eat and drink properly, and one night she became ill with and upset stomach and was sick. Lucia Cassidy, 34, form Edmonton in North London suffered 29 cardiac arrests- where her heart stopped beating- in 24 hours, but has recovered and now enters into fitness competitions . Mrs Cassidy has a burn from when doctors used defibrillators which sent 200 volts of electricity into her heart to shock it into beating normally again, saving her life . She collapsed and suffered the first of 29 cardiac arrests - where the heart stops pumping - and was rushed to hospital, drifting in and out of consciousness. Each time her heart stopped, medical teams had to fight to get it beating again - using 200 volt defibrillators, which send electric shock into the heart to get it beating again. Mrs Cassidy, 34, has now been diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome, a rare heart condition that causes fainting and episodes of abnormally rapid heart rhythm, called arrhythmia. If these episodes of arrhythmia persist, if they are not corrected electrically, they can cause cardiac arrest and death. Mrs Cassidy said: 'I just feel so lucky to be alive - people can't believe it when I tell them what happened.' 'I didn't have any warning before the attacks happened and I didn't see it coming as I try to stay fit and healthy. Long QT syndrome is an uncommon but serious heart condition. It can cause fainting and episodes of an abnormally rapid heart rhythm, called arrhythmia. This happens because the electrical activity of the heart is disrupted – a problem that is either inherited or acquired later in life. For example, some drugs antibiotics and antihistamines can trigger it. Not everyone with long QT syndrome will experience arrhythmia, but when it does happen it can be fatal. Some people with long QT syndrome will suffer arrythmia known as 'torsade de pointes', when their heart suddenly beats in an abnormally fast, uncontrollable way. When this happens, the heart cannot pump blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen, causing the person to temporarily pass out. The torsade de pointes rhythm usually returns to normal within a minute, and the person regains consciousness. The heart cannot pump blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen, causing the person to temporarily pass out. The torsade de pointes rhythm usually returns to normal within a minute, and the person regains consciousness. These episodes can start at any age and may be triggered by certain things such as stress, a sudden noise, exercise (especially swimming) and a slow heart rate during sleep. However, there is not always a trigger. Long QT is treated by medication, surgery lifestyle changes, such as eating more potassium. Source: NHS Choices . 'I had my three boys one after the other and my main concern is being a good mother to my children. 'I was more concerned with looking after everybody else and I forgot about myself. 'I was always running around after the kids and I found myself too busy to eat or drink, I was just surviving off very little. 'I developed a bit of an upset tummy, and I had painful chest but I just blamed it on breast feeding. 'I didn't realise my body was shutting down. 'I woke up in the middle of the night with an extreme thirst, and the rest is a blur. 'I was woken up by the sound of my boys crying, and I had collapsed on the floor. 'I had an out of body experience where I saw my partner Gerard giving me CPR and begging me to start breathing, and I came back around. 'When the ambulance arrived I had slipped out of consciousnesses again and the staff were performing CPR on me in on the way to hospital.' At Middlesex Hospital Mrs Cassidy was hooked up to drips but doctors found her veins had collapsed and struggled to stabilise her. She suffered cardiac arrest after cardiac arrest, leaving doctors fighting every minute to save her life. She said: 'I kept having cardiac arrests and each time I came round I was certain I was dying. 'I looked down at my feet and they were blue, because I had such poor circulation and I was just crying my eyes out at the thought of not seeing my boys again. 'Oxygen wasn't getting to my brain and it was causing me to pass out. 'I was shocked with the defibrillator each time and I even have a burn on my chest from where I received the 200 volts.' After suffering the first few attacks, and being revived again, Mrs Cassidy managed recognise when she was about to pass out. Doctors told her to try coughing which could stabilise her heartbeat, which seemed to work. Three weeks later, with her condition stable, she was allowed home to her family. She now has an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted, which is similar to a pacemaker. If the ICD senses that her heart is beating at a potentially dangerous rate, it will deliver an electrical shock, which can help return the heart to a normal rhythm or get it pumping again. Looking after her three boys Gerard, 8, Tyson, 6 and Jayden, 5, meant Mrs Cassidy often forgot to eat or drink properly, which led to an upset stomach, sickness, and her first cardiac arrest . She has lost 11kg entering into the Miss Galaxy Universe competition, and hopes to enter more in the future . Though her heart stopped many times, Mrs Cassidy does not shy away from activities which increase her pulse. She now channels her energy into fitness competitions, which have helped her focus throughout her recovery. Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system. It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia. Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning. Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing. In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked. This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert. She has even entered her first competition - the Miss Galaxy Universe competition, which celebrates female athletic ability and physique. Lucia said: 'The heart attacks were the worst and best experience I've had. I was so scared but now I have survived it, I have a whole new perspective on life. 'Everything was almost taken away from me, but now I am much braver than I was before and I have decided to fight back and enjoy myself. 'Training for the Miss Galaxy Universe competition really helped me recover from my ordeal. 'It gave me something to aim towards and a reason to get fit and healthy again. 'I worked out with a personal trainer and I wanted to achieve a strong and supple body.' After losing 11kg for the competition, she hopes to enter more in the future. She said: 'I've got the bug now, it is so addictive. The doctors couldn't believe how well I recovered and I am now determined to push myself. 'I want to do more fitness competitions and keep enjoying my life to the full.'","Lucia Cassidy, 34, forgot to eat and drink as she was caring for her children .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . During World War II, the U.S. Navy wanted to boost sailors' night vision so they could spot infrared signal lights. According to some reports, they fed volunteers supplements made from the livers of walleyed pikes, and over several months, the volunteers’ vision began seeing the infrared region. While this legendary tale may sound far-fetched, a crowd-funded group of scientists has recreated this experiment and claims to have had successful results. After several weeks, volunteers using an electroretinogram (ERG) noticed spikes in their vision to 950 nanometres (nm). Infrared falls between about 800nm to 2500nm on the electromagnetic spectrum . Infrared vision helps animals such as snakes see the heat signature of their prey, but without night goggles, humans don’t have this ability. The latest experiment was designed by Science for the Masses, a US-based group whose vision is to explore ‘non-institutional open source science.’ They claim that by limiting Vitamin A1 in the diet and replacing it with A2, the human body increase its production of something called porphyropsin. This is the protein complex that grants near infrared (NIR) vision to freshwater fish - and so, they say, can give humans completely natural infrared vision. Vitamin A1 is commonly found in green and . yellow-pigmented vegetables including bell peppers and carrots. Vitamin . A2, on the other hand, is derived from fish livers. Infrared vision helps animals such as snakes see the heat signature of their prey, but without night googles, humans don’t have this ability.

After several weeks, four volunteers using an electroretinogram (ERG) noticed spikes in their vision to 950 nanometres (nm). It is is not known how the volunteers took their high levels of Vitamin A2. Infrared falls between about 800nm to 2500nm on the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning they could pick up some heat signatures. However, there has been some scepticism about the results. Retinal neuroscientist Bryan Jones wrote in Petapixel that no matter what we eat, photoreceptors in our eyes simply cannot pick up any wavelengths of light beyond 650nm. ‘These limits in human photoreceptors are based upon molecular structures of photopigments,’ he said. ‘These photopigments can be “tuned” within a narrow window within the red/blue/green spectrum, but getting them to be sensitive to infrared wavelengths is impossible within the limits of physics or biophysics.’ Researchers have unveiled plans for a contact lens that could give its wearer infrared 'night vision' Researchers have unveiled plans for a smart contact lens that could give its wearer infrared 'night vision'. The team say that by sandwiching graphene inside the lens they can build a sensor capable of capturing every from visible light to infrared. They have already built a prototype smaller than a fingernail, and experts say it could one day be built into lenses for soldiers and others who need to see in the dark. Zhaohui Zhong at the University of Michigan say their layered approach can lead to ultrathin sensors. 'We can make the entire design super-thin,' said Professor Zhong, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering It can be stacked on a contact lens or integrated with a cell phone.' The prototype device created by Professor Zhong is already 'smaller than a pinky nail' and can be easily scaled down. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Professor Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.'","Science for the Masses raised $4,000 (£2,400) from public to fund study .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . There is a new chef in town who plans to give Heston Blumenthal a run for his money. The cooking-maestro, named Watson, has been impressing crowds in Zurich with its broccoli mango soup, chocolate burritos and Belgian bacon cake. But Watson isn't any ordinary chef. It is, in fact, a supercomputer who originally rose to fame after beating quiz show champion Ken Jennings at Jeopardy. Click below to view Watson's recipes . Watson, created by IBM, uses a database of tried-and-tested recipes from around the world. It then combines this with information about which flavours are present in ingredients, and uses something called 'hedonic perception theory' to model how humans react to its recipes. Chefs begin by inputting a main ingredient, such as apple for instance, as well as a regional cuisine such as Eastern Europe. Watson then flips through a nearly endless database of recipes. The offbeat list of ingredients Watson spits out may not always sound delicious - suggesting apples has coaxed Watson to produce the offbeat garlicky, pork loin-laced Baltic Apple Pie.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A school bus driver in Massachusetts was punched in the face when a confrontation broke out with parents who claim the driver wouldn't let their kids off the bus. In a video of the tense confrontation reported by MassLive, the adults are heard cursing at the driver and demanding their children be let off at a bus stop in Worcester. Children from the Quinsigamond Elementary School are heard screaming and shouting while the bus sits at the stop with its windows rolled up on Wednesday. 'It's hot in here,' one kids screams. Scroll down for video . Angry parents in Massachusetts confront a bus driver who they say wouldn't let their kids off a sweltering bus . A few minutes in, the bus begins to move — and parents become even angrier. 'Oh, my god, don't leave with my kid,' shouts parent Jessica Jimenez, who shared the video with MassLive. 'Don't leave with my kid.' Some parents blocked the bus while others told children to leave through the emergency exit, according to MassLive. One of the parents broke the front door of the bus and a 16-year-old girl walked in to pick up her sister. 'They broke the window. I went in to try and get my little sister and the lady said it was kidnapping or whatever and she pushed me, so I punched her,' Igdala Lebron told WCVB. The kids eventually hopped off the bus through the back, crying while the bus alarm blared. 'To see my two children trapped that way, helpless as I felt, was terrifying,' Nicole Prizio, whose 8- and 10-year-old children were on the bus, told MassLive. School officials say the driver was simply following security protocols — but the parents jumped the gun. One parent is seen storming the bus (left) during the tense standoff between them and a school driver . 'Some of the adults were impatient and just wanted the students released,' schools Superintendent Melinda Boone told the Worcester Telegram and Gazette.  'Some attempted to board the bus to take the students, at which point the driver closed the door with the idea of stabilizing the situation.' The driver told parents that adults are not allowed on the bus with students on board — and when the parents refused to leave, a supervisor told the driver via radio to close the door, the school said. 'Parents broke the door and entered the school bus,' the school said. 'The school bus driver was also physically assaulted, struck at least two times in the face.' The 16-year-old girl who allegedly punched the driver will be summonsed for assault and battery, according to the school officials. The driver of this bus was punched in the face while following school protocol, angering parents who just wanted their kids off the bus . Police are still investigating the incident. 'We felt like, you know, she was holding them hostage,' parent Marilyn Poske told CBS Boston. Dad Luis Rivera says the driver was just doing her job. 'She has a protocol that she has to let off the kindergarten kids first, and then the bigger kids get off,' Rivera told CBS Boston. 'She wasn’t going to let any kids out until the parents at least calmed down so she could do her job and they weren’t allowing her to do that.'","Parents in Worcester, Massachusetts, say their kids were trapped in the bus .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Hundreds of lakes and seas are known of on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, filled not with water but with hydrocarbons such as methane. Most of these bodies of liquid are thought to be replenished by rainfall from clouds in the moon's atmosphere, but now research says underground reservoirs may also be feeding them. In a study scientists found that subsurface 'springs' of propane and ethane may be contributing to some bodies of liquid - and the effects may be noticeable on the surface. A researcher in France says bodies of liquid on Titan may be fed by underground springs. This artist's rendering shows a cross-section of the surface and subsurface of Titan Saturn's moon Titan. An 'alkanofer' is a resevoir of liquid hydrocarbons, while clathrates are compounds that trap other substances . The study was carried out by Dr Olivier Mousis, a research associate for the Cassini spacecraft, currently in orbit around Saturn, at the University of Franche-Comté, France. He examined how Titan’s methane rainfall would interact with icy materials in underground reservoirs. And with colleagues he found that runoff from this rainfall was likely leading to the formation of springs of propane and ethane, which in turn were feeding the lakes and seas. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. The results of this could be noticed on Titan's surface, meaning scientists may be able work out what is happening underground simply by looking at the moon from space. The scientists modeled how a subsurface reservoir of liquid hydrocarbons, also called an 'alkanofer,' once filled with methane rainfall runoff, would diffuse through Titan's porous, icy crust. They found that this diffusion could cause a new reservoir  to form where the bottom of the original underground reservoir meets layers of non-porous ice. Importantly, this process would continue up to Titan's surface. Lakes fed by these propane or ethane subsurface reservoirs would show the same kind of composition, whereas those fed by rainfall would be different and contain methane, nitrogen, and trace amounts of argon and carbon monoxide. In other words, the composition of the lake could indicate what is happening deep underground. ‘We knew that a significant fraction of the lakes on Titan's surface might possibly be connected with hidden bodies of liquid beneath Titan's crust, but we just didn't know how they would interact,’ said Mousis. ‘Now, we have a better idea of what these hidden lakes or oceans could be like.’ The finding was made when studying how methane rain interacts with lakes on Titan (pictured). It was found that rainfall runoff was likely feeding underground resevoirs. These in turn would change in chemical composition before adding to existing lakes and seas . The process of underground reservoirs feeding lakes and seas (illustrated) could be spotted on the surface, meaning scientists may be able to work out what is happening underground on Titan just by observing the moon from space . Clathrates are compounds in which water forms a crystal structure with small cages that trap other substances like methane and ethane. Clathrates that contain methane are found on Earth in some polar and ocean sediments. On Titan, the surface pressure and temperature should allow clathrates to form when liquid hydrocarbons come into contact with water ice, which is a major component of the moon's crust. These clathrate layers could remain stable as far down as several miles below Titan's surface. Mousis and his colleagues came to the conclusion when they found that the formation of materials called clathrates changes the chemical composition of the rainfall runoff that feeds hydrocarbon 'aquifers' - reservoirs of liquid underground. One of the peculiar properties of clathrates is that they trap and split molecules into a mix of liquid and solid phases, in a process called fractionation. Titan's underground clathrate reservoirs would interact with and fractionate the liquid methane from the original underground hydrocarbon lake, slowly changing its composition. Eventually the original methane aquifer would be turned into a propane or ethane aquifer. 'Our study shows that the composition of Titan's underground liquid reservoirs can change significantly through their interaction with the icy subsurface, provided the reservoirs are cut off from the atmosphere for some period of time,' said Dr Mathieu Choukroun of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), one of three co-authors of the study with Dr Mousis. Importantly, the chemical transformations taking place underground would affect Titan's surface. Lakes and rivers fed by springs from propane or ethane subsurface reservoirs would show the same kind of composition, whereas those fed by rainfall would be different and contain a significant fraction of methane. This means researchers could examine the composition of Titan's surface lakes to learn something about what is happening deep underground, said Mousis.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Researchers claim the Ebola virus disease (EVD) is rapidly and continually mutating, making it harder to diagnose and treat. A study of the initial patients diagnosed with the virus in Sierra Leone revealed almost 400 genetic modifications. And it could be detrimental not only to current treatments, but also to future vaccines that are in the works. Researchers at the Broad Institute in Massachusetts and Harvard University claim the Ebola virus (transmission electron micrograph image shown) is mutating rapidly. The findings show it is becoming more difficult to diagnose and treat. Future vaccines could also be less effective as mutations continue . The team of researchers, led by the Broad Institute in Massachusetts and Harvard University, analysed more than 99 Ebola virus genomes. Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent. In the current outbreak it is just over 50 per cent. The virus is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy. The virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days. Although the disease has no cure, modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down. Source: World Health Organisation . These were collected from 78 patients diagnosed with Ebola in Sierra Leona in the first 24 days of the outbreak. Their findings, reported in the journal Science, could have important implications for rapid field diagnostic tests. The team found more than 300 genetic changes that make the 2014 Ebola virus genomes distinct from the viral genomes tied to previous Ebola outbreaks. They also found variations in the genome sequence indicating that, from the samples analysed, the outbreak started from a single introduction into humans, subsequently spreading from person to person over many months. To accelerate response efforts, the research team released the full-length sequences on the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI's) DNA sequence database, in advance of publication. This means the data is available to the global scientific community. 'By making the data immediately available to the community, we hope to accelerate response efforts,' said co-senior author Dr Pardis Sabeti, a senior associate member at the Broad Institute and an associate professor at Harvard University. 'Upon releasing our first batch of Ebola sequences in June, some of the world's leading epidemic specialists contacted us, and many of them are now also actively working on the data. We were honored and encouraged. 'A spirit of international and multidisciplinary collaboration is needed to quickly shed light on the ongoing outbreak.' This map shows the countries affected by Ebola as of 14 August 2014. The latest study was based on analysis of 78 patients diagnosed in the first 24 days of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. The scientists have released their findings to help efforts to halt the spread of Ebola . The 2014 Ebola outbreak is unprecedented both in its size and in its emergence in multiple populated areas. Previous outbreaks had been localised, mostly to sparsely populated regions of Middle Africa, with the largest outbreak in 1976 reporting 318 cases. By comparison, the 2014 outbreak has manifested in the more densely-populated West Africa, and since it was first reported in Guinea in March 2014, 2,240 cases have been confirmed with 1,229 deaths as of 19 August. Dr Augustine Goba, Director of the Lassa Laboratory at the Kenema Government Hospital and a co-first author of the paper, identified the first Ebola virus disease case in Sierra Leone. 'We established surveillance for Ebola well ahead of the disease's spread into Sierra Leone and began retrospective screening for the disease on samples as far back as January of this year,' said Dr Goba. 'This was possible because of our long-standing work to diagnose and study another deadly disease, Lassa fever. 'We could thus identify cases and trace the Ebola virus spread as soon as it entered our country.' Workers unload medical supplies to fight the Ebola epidemic from a USAID cargo flight on 24 August 2014 in Harbel, Liberia. International aid agencies and the Liberian government are struggling to keep up with the rapidly-expanding epidemic. The deadly virus has killed at least 1,400 people in West Africa . The research team increased the amount of genomic data available on the Ebola virus by four-fold and used the technique of 'deep sequencing' on all available samples. Deep sequencing is sequencing done enough times to generate high confidence in the results. The research team increased the amount of genomic data available on the Ebola virus by four-fold and used the technique of 'deep sequencing' on all available samples. Deep sequencing is sequencing done enough times to generate high confidence in the results. In this study, researchers sequenced at a depth of 2,000 times on average for each Ebola genome to get an extremely close-up view of the virus genomes from 78 patients. This high-resolution view allowed the team to detect multiple mutations that alter protein sequences - potential targets for future diagnostics, vaccines and therapies. The team's catalogue of 395 mutations may serve as a starting point for other research groups.

This high-resolution view allowed the team to detect multiple mutations that alter protein sequences - potential targets for future diagnostics, vaccines and therapies. The Ebola strains responsible for the current outbreak likely have a common ancestor, dating back to the very first recorded outbreak in 1976. The researchers also traced the transmission path and evolutionary relationships of the samples, revealing that the lineage responsible for the current outbreak diverged from the Middle African version of the virus within the last ten years and spread from Guinea to Sierra Leone by 12 people who had attended the same funeral. The team's catalogue of 395 mutations may serve as a starting point for other research groups. 'We've uncovered more than 300 genetic clues about what sets this outbreak apart from previous outbreaks,' said Stephen Gire, a research scientist in the Sabeti lab at the Broad Institute and Harvard. 'Although we don't know whether these differences are related to the severity of the current outbreak, by sharing these data with the research community, we hope to speed up our understanding of this epidemic and support global efforts to contain it.' 'There is an extraordinary battle still ahead, and we have lost many friends and colleagues already like our good friend and colleague Dr. Humarr Khan, a co-senior author here,' said Sabeti. 'By providing this data to the research community immediately and demonstrating that transparency and partnership is one way we hope to honor Humarr's legacy. We are all in this fight together.'","Researchers from Massachusetts claim the Ebola virus is 'mutating rapidly'

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . Google has built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages. Called Project Wing, it is being developed at Google X, the company's secret research lab, which is also developing its  self-driving car and Glass wearable computer. The firm says the drones could eventually be used for disaster relief by delivering aid to isolated areas - and for package delivery. Scroll down for video . Google has already tested the drone delivery system in Australia . Eventually Google said it could use unmanned flying vehicles to deliver shopping items to consumers at home. 'Self-flying vehicles could open up entirely new approaches to moving goods – including options that are cheaper, faster, less wasteful and more environmentally sensitive than what's possible today,' the firm said. 'There's a lot of friction in how we do things currently – double-parked delivery trucks clog city streets, traffic jams choke the fast-growing cities of Africa and Asia.' Project Wing's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically-driven propellers. They will fly a programmed route with just the push of a button, and they'll follow rules to respond safely if they run into unexpected situations like a gust of wind, Google says. The project was originally envisaged by Google boss Sergey Brin as a way to deliver defibrillators to heart attack victims, but has since been expanded. 'Even just a few of these, being able to shuttle nearly continuously could service a very large number of people in an emergency situation,'  Astro Teller, Captain of Moonshots - Google X's name for big-thinking projects, told the BBC. Project Wing's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically-driven propellers. The total weight, including the package to be delivered, is approximately 10kg (22lb). The aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg (18.7lb). The hybrid 'tail sitter' design has wings for fast forward flight, and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take-off and landing. Dual mode operation gives the self-flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters. It can take off or land without a runway, and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages. Packages are stored in the drone's 'belly' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground. At the end of the tether, there's a little bundle of electronics the team call the 'egg,' which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle. 'We expect it will take years to develop a service with multiple vehicles flying multiple deliveries per day,' Google said. Eventually Google said it could use unmanned flying vehicles to deliver shopping items to consumers at home. 'Self-flying vehicles could open up entirely new approaches to moving goods – including options that are cheaper, faster, less wasteful and more environmentally sensitive than what's possible today,' the firm said. 'Throughout history, major shifts in how we move goods from place to place have led to new opportunities for economic growth and generally made consumers' lives easier. 'From steam ships to the railroads, from the postal service to delivery services like FedEx and DHL, speed has reshaped society not only with greater convenience but also by making more goods accessible to more people. 'Furthermore, there's a lot of friction in how we do things currently – double-parked delivery trucks clog city streets, traffic jams choke the fast-growing cities of Africa and Asia. And have you ever thought about how environmentally unfriendly it is to send a 2000kg car across town with a 2kg package of food?' The prototype vehicles that the company has built have successfully been tested by delivering packages to remote farms in Queensland, Australia from neighbouring properties. Australia was selected as a test site due to what Google calls 'progressive' rules about the use of drones, which are more tightly controlled in other parts of the word.

The online retailer created a media frenzy in December when it outlined a plan on CBS' 60 Minutes to deliver packages with self-guided aircrafts that seemed straight out of science fiction. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds. About 86 percent of Amazon's deliveries are 5 pounds or less, the company said. 'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' Amazon said.","Google has been working on Project Wing for two years .

"By . Associated Press . Life-sized figures sketched into red rock cliffs in Canyonlands National Park were drawn 1,000 years more recently than thought, a team of Utah State University scientists has claimed. The team used modern luminescence dating techniques to analyze when the art went up in what is known as the 'Great Gallery' in southeastern Utah's Horseshoe Canyon. The researchers believe the figures were created 1,000 to 2,000 years ago instead of the previously thought 2,000 to 4,000 years ago. The Holy Ghost group of the Great Gallery, a striking Barrier Canyon-style rock painting in Horseshoe Canyon of southern Utah's Canyonlands National Park. Luminescence dating techniques have been around for decades, but the method for the study is a newer form and was used with the help of scientists from Denmark, Pederson said. They homed in on a date estimate by studying how sunlight bleached away stored signals of radiation on the exposed rocks, he said. Pederson and Simms are hopeful they can study other rock art to determine more precise date estimates, saying they believe the technique is widely applicable. The study suggests the drawings may been done as man transitioned to a culture of farming and away from hunting and gathering, said David Whitley, one of the foremost experts on rock art in North America. The research becomes important in better understanding art known as Ancient Barrier Canyon-style paintings, which are usually shrouded in mystery, said Whitley, who was not involved in the study. Because of the more recent time stamp, the art was likely created during a time of great transition, when new ideologies, religions and customs were emerging, said Steven Simms, a Utah State University anthropology professor, who worked with university geology professor Joel Pederson on the study. 'It puts in a very momentous time,' Simms said. They published a paper of their findings this month in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Determining the date of rock art is very difficult, and there has traditionally been very little interest from scientists in tackling the projects, said Whitely, who has studied rock art for 35 years and written 17 books. 'We tend to think of art and science as being polar opposites. The result is that artists don't talk about science much, and scientists don't talk about art much,' Whitley said. 'I'm very happy they did this.' USU geologist Joel Pederson gazing at the human-like figures painted on a rock face of the Great Gallery of Canyonlands National Park¿s Horseshoe Canyon, Utah. The seeds of the study were planted about eight years ago when a man brought a piece of sandstone from the area to Pederson. The retired scientist and rock-art enthusiast wanted to find out if it were possible to assess the date of a drawing by looking at the composition or color of the rocks. The question piqued the interest of Pederson, who specializes in the history of rivers and has written articles on the age of the Grand Canyon. A detail of prehistoric rock paintings from the Great Gallery, situated in a remote section of southern Utah's Canyonlands National Park, Utah. After going to see the Horseshoe Canyon figures up close, Pederson was determined to test the man's theory. 'I realized, we can actually figure out the date of this,' Pederson said. 'It was just kind of luck that a rock-art enthusiast knocked on my door.' About a year later, he began work on the project that would take seven years to complete on a shoestring budget.

'If they'd given us any reassurance or explanation it would have calmed the situation but it got to the point where there could have been a riot.' MailOnline has discovered that some flight passengers have been forced to remain in Malaga, forking out for their own accommodation as they were unable to book flights until Saturday. A beauty therapist who was among the passengers had to warn her clients she would not be in the salon because of what she described on Facebook as a ‘horrendous incident’. The 'agitated' passenger launched into a series of bizarre antics when his request to see the cockpit was rejected. The man, described as in his early 30s and of African descent, took pictures of the plane and cabin crew before taking a selfie and snapping his phone's SIM card and throwing it down a toilet. 'The air hostesses were crying and there was a scuffle at the front of the plane', said passenger Nick Taylor who left the plane with his wife and son . The man was eventually allowed to return to his seat and the flight landed in Manchester two hours later than scheduled . Airport staff and Spanish police carried out security checks before eventually letting the man return to his seat. Another passenger, who asked not to be named, said: 'As soon as the man got back on the plane the captain ordered for the door to be shut and began making the usual announcements without consulting his staff or passengers. 'A stewardess knocked on the cockpit door and returned saying if she got off the plane she'd be sacked. She said she told head office they should look after her kids if anything happened.' The flight landed in Manchester at 3.45pm - around two hours later than scheduled. The 36 passengers were told to make their own arrangements to get home and were later booked on a flight to Leeds and transferred via minibus. A Jet2.com spokesman said: 'A number of our passengers chose not to travel because they weren't happy travelling with a fellow passenger, despite that person clearing all required security checks.'","Jet2.com flight from Malaga stranded on runway for more than two hours .

"By . Katie Amey for MailOnline . Scotland's most expensive hotel has closed just two years after owners spent £5 million on the initial project. The Atholl, located in Edinburgh's posh West End, broke barriers when it became the first Scottish hotel to charge £1,000 per night in April 2012. Despite high expectations on the luxe property, the uber-expensive hotel proved to be just too excessive - at nearly four times the rate charged by nearby five-star hotels. The Atholl Hotel has permanently closed its doors just two years after the initial £5 million investment . Rooms at The Atholl broke the £1000-a-night barrier and were the first to charge that much in Scotland . The luxe hotel offered Michelin-starred dining from Albert Roux and an award-winning garden . Day to night: The Atholl was located on Atholl Crescent, which is one of the poshest areas of Edinburgh . With the Georgian building's high price tag came Michelin-starred dining by Albert Roux, Hermes wallpaper favoured by the likes of Victoria Beckham, and an award-winning garden. However, owner and Edinburgh businesswoman Alison Davies announced today that The Atholl has closed its doors for good. Tourists hoping to stay at the hotel realised this upon attempting to log on to the now defunct website or call the unavailable phone number. According to a spokesperson for Alison Davies, the hotel will now be converted into flats. Other five-star hotels in Scotland charge only a fraction of the price - nearly four times less . The coveted property will now be turned into four individual flats, says a spokesperson for the owner . If these walls could talk! The palatial interior boasted wallpaper from French fashion design house Hermes . Peter Irvine, author of Scotland the Best, warned that The Atholl was 'ambitious' back in 2012. Still, he remains upbeat upon hearing of its closure. 'There are now many options in Edinburgh and elsewhere in Scotland for ""luxurious accommodation"" - so no shortage of opportunities for the well-minted to spill their cash.'","The Atholl was previously known as Scotland's most expensive hotel .

"By . Belinda Robinson . The much-loved Florida manatee could soon be taken off the endangered species list and reclassified as ‘threatened’ according to wildlife officials. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is reviewing whether the gentle manatee should be reclassified as a ‘threatened species,’ because they're no longer facing extinction. Under a 1967 law, the manatee were given a federal listing as an endangered species, the most protective classification. Endangered: The much-loved Florida manatee, pictured here, could soon be taken off the endangered species list and reclassified as 'threatened' Damage: Manatee Phoenix, in the foreground, has a damaged tail which was disfigured and damaged by a boat propeller . Hurt: In this photo manatee Phoenix's disfigured tail, can be seen close up after it was damaged by a boat propeller . But Florida's manatee population has grown from several hundred in 1967 to over 4,800 this year. Now environmentalists are engaged in an ongoing fight with a group of boaters, businesses and conservatives over whether the manatee should have its status changed. Agency spokesman, Chuck Underwood said: ‘If we come to the end of this and decide reclassification is warranted, it's good news because it means the manatee is recovering and no longer on the brink of extinction.’ The agency is seeking public comment on its finding that a petition to reclassify the manatee has merits by Tuesday. A decision on whether a change is warranted won't be made until the agency completes its review, which could take a year. But hundreds of manatees are still being scarred . and having their tails disfigured from boat propellers zooming around . Florida's waters which is leaving them unable to survive in the wild. Chicago resident Greg Groff regularly stops by the Miami Seaquarium with his young daughter Olivia to see the speed bump-shaped marine mammals. As he watched the sea cows swim in circles, he noted the pink scars on one’s body. Fans: Greg Groff and his daughter Olivia, of Chicago, walk during a visit at the Miami Seaquarium in Key Biscayne, Florida they noted the pink scars and disfigured tail on one manatee, damage from a boat propeller . He argues that the manatees need even more stringent protections than their listing on the federal endangered species list. He said boaters should go elsewhere if they don't like speed limits in waters where manatees swim. Manatees, also known as sea cows, are vegetarian giants that average nearly 10 feet long and 2,200 pounds. They live near the shore and in coastal waterways around much of Florida. The animal's biggest threats are boats, cold water, toxic algae blooms and fishing debris like discarded lines and ropes. A record 829 manatees died last year, breaking the 2010 record of 766, according to state records. But the most worrisome deaths last year were not collisions with boats. Majestic: A manatee swims among a school of fish as The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviews its classification . Friendly: In this photo taken at the Miami Seaquarium in Key Biscayne, Florida the gentle mammal shows off its temperament . A record 276 manatee deaths were caused by a toxic red tide bloom in the Gulf of Mexico. There were also the unexplained deaths of more than 100 manatees on Florida's east coast, where pollution and algae blooms have plagued a vital lagoon ecosystem. Meanwhile, critics of the manatee's current endangered listing say manatees are important to the state's tourism industry and environment. They suggest that the species has recovered sufficiently over the last 47 years to be reclassified. Under current regulations, boaters must avoid manatee areas or obey tight speed limits and fishermen can't use some equipment. In 2012, Save Crystal River Inc. and the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation petitioned the government to reclassify the manatee. The group represents about 100 members that include recreational boaters, tour operators, dive shops and hotels. They cited a 2007 federal review that recommended listing the species as threatened since the population is recovering. Boat rope: A Florida manatee chews on a boat rope thought to massage their gums and clean their mouths but a record 829 manatees died last year . Steve Lamb, vice president of Save Crystal River said: ‘The truth is the manatee is protected the same as threatened as endangered, but they no longer can use the species to take over sovereign lands and sovereign waters with arbitrary rules.’ According to the wildlife service, officials began working on the reclassification proposal in 2013. It was shelved due to funding constraints during the U.S. government shutdown and concerns over recent spikes in manatee deaths. Save the Manatees Club Executive Director Pat Rose said that while the species has certainly rebounded, more work needs to be done. ‘The most compelling reason not to down-list them is the status of their ecosystems,’ Rose said. ‘If you maintain good quality habitat, you can overcome catastrophic mortality events. ‘If you are dealing with both catastrophic mortality events and unrelenting compromises to their aquatic ecosystems at the same time, that's when you need to be acting very conservatively. But Lamb says the government is bowing to political pressure and emotion, highlighting conservation efforts at the expense of the law and business. ‘Does anyone ever want to talk about how last year 1,000 manatees were born? Heck, no. All they want to talk about is how many died,’ Lamb said.","The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is reviewing whether the gentle manatee should be reclassified as a ‘threatened species’

"By . Michael Gadd for MailOnline . A P&O cruise line passenger has expressed outrage at artwork being prominently displayed on a ship featuring a story about missing British girl Madeleine McCann. The piece shows a row of people sitting while a variety of newspapers, including one copy of the Sunday Times that shows a lead story on the search for Maddy. Michael Gould, 55, was especially dismayed at the work being hung in full view of his children as he escorted them to a child's club area on board the P&O ship the Ventura. 'Odd': Father of three Michael Gould shows an artwork featuring Madeleine McCann from a P&O cruise ship . Full view: Gould said he saw the work when he took his children to the child's club area on the ship . Father-of-three Michael was on holiday with his wife Corinna and their youngest daughter Olivia on a Mediterranean cruise in early July. The company director from Liverpool said the family were staying at the rear - aft - of the ship and during the evening would walk up a flight of stairs to take Olivia, aged five, to an area devoted to children. 'I just thought it was a very odd piece of art to have on a child-friendly ship, we went past it every night to the child's club en route from our cabin,' Gould said. 'It was at the top of the aft stair well in a high-profile public area. When I contacted P&O about it they more or less said ""well it's there"". 'P&O said the artist was depicting the sad realities of life, I don't go on holiday to be reminded of the sad realities of life. 'I think what's happened is someone somewhere has said we need a load of art for the ship and this has been done.

Search: Gould shows a close-up of the Sunday Times story about the investigation into Maddy's disappearance . Gould said he had emailed the company and been told the mural was not going to be taken down. He said: 'It was a very successful holiday, it would not be the case to say the whole holiday was ruined by this. 'However as somebody who is interested in art and collects art we found this a very odd thing to have on a child-friendly boat.' A spokesperson for P&O said: 'The artist intended to depict a snapshot of the headlines and capture a moment in time through actual front pages.' Maddy has been missing since May 2007 when she disappeared during a holiday in Portugal with her family.

"By . Andrea Magrath for MailOnline . The billionaire Prince of Dubai is planning to construct a new 16-bedroom lodge in the Scottish Highlands, right next to his current 14-bedroom holiday home. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum has applied for planning permission to add to the existing luxury buildings on his 63,000-acre estate in Inverinate in Wester Ross. The 65-year-old sheikh's architects have submitted plans for the 'modern hunting lodge' which includes an interconnected swimming pool, gym and leisure facilities. There are also plans to install seven satellite dishes on the estate. Highland holiday home: The Prince of Dubai has submitted plans to build a 16-bedroom hunting lodge next to his current 14-bedroom home in the Scottish Highlands . He has owned Inverinate Estate for more than 20 years, and visits every year in the summer for several weeks to escape Dubai's heat, which can reach 50C temperatures. Sheikh Mohammed is well-liked within the community, and is regarded as a generous landlord. He built Inverinate and Loch Duich Community Centre and also gifted land for a day care centre and eight sheltered houses for elderly people at Dornie. Landowner: Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum has owned Inverinate Estate for 20 years . Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell, who lives around three miles from Sheikh Mohammed's Highland residence, said she could not comment on the application as she was a planning committee member. However, she said the family had brought many benefits to the area. 'Sheikh Mohammed is a very good landlord to the community,' said Cllr Campbell. 'When we were trying to do up the hall he stepped in and financed it and when we were trying desperately to find provision for elderly people after Graham House in Dornie closed, he gifted land for a daycare centre and eight sheltered houses. 'He's very well regarded in the community. He employs 12 people full-time on Inverinate Estate and when he visits there are lots of other people taken on to help cater for the family. He was up recently with friends - he loves the area and walking in the hills.' The submitted plans are more extravagant than a previous application for a 16-bedroom house approved in 2009, despite being recommended for refusal by planners who said the design was 'more akin to a development found in business parks'. The design statement submitted by his agents, KJ Architects Ltd, said they planned to use locally sourced materials. 'The planning permission for the new lodge at Inverinate is for a modern, contemporary, interpretation of a hunting lodge which was designed to contrast and supplement the existing lodge without resorting to pastiche or mimicry,' it reads. 'There will be no impact on either individual or community residential amenity, while the building will bring significant benefits to the local community through employment both during construction and for housekeeping/maintenance staff and so on after completion, including increased local spend.' Like a local: Sheikh Mohammed is well-liked  for his generosity and for employing many in the community . The billionaire sheikh is planning a swimming pool, gym and leisure facilities, as well as seven satellite dishes . Wealth: The UAE royal family receive around £1bn a year from the country's oil reserves. Sheikh Mohammed, a billionaire and a renowned racehorse breeder, has a great love of poetry and has penned his own collection, Poems from the Desert. The emir of Dubai's younger brother is prime minister and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. The fabulously wealthy family receive around £1bn a year from the country's oil reserves. Highland Council is currently consulting on the planning application which will be determined within the next few weeks.","Billionaire Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum has applied for permission to build the luxury hunting lodge on his 63,000-acre estate .

The video, shot on a Go-pro camera attached to a car, shows wide roads that are pristine and almost empty of people and traffic. Though there are smartly dressed traffic wardens, it is less ordered and formal than one might expect. Communist North Korea has drawn international criticism for the extent of human suffering which occurs at the hands of the DPRK government. A UN report earlier this year outlined the stark reality of living conditions there - where every home is fitted with a speaker for propaganda to be blared out, children are taught to draw pictures of Dear Leader and sexual assault by state officials is common. Pedestrians meander through the streets and Soviet style skyscrapers are seen in the background . The clean streets of Pyongyang: The quiet roads  are immaculate, but the scene is stark and lonely . Only around 6,000 foreign tourists visit each year and there are many restrictions to what they can photograph and film. For example, visitors are prohibited from filming construction sites, undeveloped locations or military personnel. But tourism could increase in the future as Pyonyang recently announced the country's first surf tour, which followed the opening of a ski resort earlier this year.

The former British paratrooper was denied entry into Russia in 2012 despite previous visits, forcing him to take a detour on an epic quest that may end with a major gap unless he is allowed to return to the transcontinental nation. Battling the elements: Karl Bushby has been walking around the world - facing extreme weather - for 16 years . Roadblock: The former British paratrooper was denied entry into Russia in 2012 despite previous visits . Mr Bushby, from Hull, started his 36,000-mile journey in Punta Arenas, Chile in November 1998 and he hit a major roadblock when he was turned away from Russia after covering more than 20,000 miles. The 45-year-old doesn’t know the reason he was not allowed to enter the country, but he suspects it may have something to do with an accidental crossing into Siberia. He said: ‘I think there were security concerns from the outset regarding my military background but I left the army before the walk began. ‘I also suspect it might have been issued due to my accidental crossing a provincial border in Siberia without the necessary paperwork - but given the landscape there it is difficult to tell whether this actually happened.’ Epic quest: Karl Bushby started his 36,000-mile journey in Punta Arenas, Chile in November 1998 . The 45-year-old from Hull is currently walking across the US from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. Karl Bushby plans to apply for a visa when he visits the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. this month . Mr Bushby’s extraordinary journey is nearing a critical point as he walks across the US, from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, and sleeps in a tent along the way. When he completes the 2,600-mile trek around 10 September – one year and seven days after he departed Los Angeles – he plans to visit the Russian Embassy to convince officials to grant him a new visa. If he is granted entry his hike will not end in Russia, however. He plans to travel across Europe – averaging 20 miles a day – and hopes to complete his journey in the UK within six years. If the visa ban is not lifted Karl Bushby will have to wait 10 years before he can legally apply to return to Russia . By averaging 20 miles a day, Karl Bushby hopes to complete his journey in the UK within six years . But if the visa ban is not lifted he will have to wait another 10 years before he can legally apply to return to Russia. He said: ‘ I can only hope the embassy takes note of my goodwill gesture - walking 3,500 miles across the US with a letter to the ambassador - and allows me a few moments to plead my case. ‘The best part about this trip has been everything - from falling in love, finding cold water, not being shot at by guerrilla armies, arriving at a long sought after waypoint, making your 20 miles a day, to even a cup of coffee. ‘The worst parts have been your heart broken, being alone, mosquitoes, getting stuff stolen, never being able to reach that waypoint, unable to make the 20 miles a day, and, of course, getting banned from entering a country.’ Mr Bushby suspects he was denied entry into Russia due to a previous accidental crossing into Siberia . The British man says one of the hike's highlights has been not being shot at by guerrilla armies .","Karl Bushby has been walking around the globe for nearly 16 years .

Luminous lava and smoke were in full view at the pilot took an extra loop for customers to take in. 'Our pilot made an extra circle around #Bardarbunga this morning to let passengers check it out,' Icelandair posted on Twitter, with thanks to passenger Erla Vinsy for the out-the-window image. Scroll down for video . While it's common for a pilot to mention what passengers are seeing out of their respective windows, it's rare for a commercial operator to change course to play the role of a sightseeing facilitator. Thousands of earthquakes in the region around Bardarbunga, Iceland's largest volcano, for a number of weeks sparking fears of a repeat of the 2010 ash cloud crisis. Over the weekend Iceland's Met Office raised its aviation warning from its second highest level, orange, to the highest, red, as lava shot 70 metres into the air.

"By . Andrea Magrath for MailOnline . Mexico City will quadruple the number of passengers flying in each year to 120 million by  2050 with a new £5.5bn airport. The chosen design, by British architect Lord Norman Foster and Mexico's Fernando Romero, was unveiled on Wednesday. The lightweight membrane roof of the terminal forms a giant 'X', and the entrance to the terminal will feature a garden of cacti and symbols of the eagle and snake, in reference to the Mexican flag. X marks the spot: The design for a new £5.5bn airport in Mexico City has been unveiled . Communications and transportation department secretary Gerardo Ruiz said both architects were picked by a committee, and that contrary to past controversial airport proposals, the authorities would not expropriate any land. Lord Foster is one of the world's leading architects and designed the Beijing Terminal 3 airport. Mr Romero is the son-in-law of billionaire Mexican telecom magnate Carlos Slim. The new Mexico City airport will cover nearly 11,400 acres of former lakebed about six miles from the present, over-crowded facility. It will have six runways and it's expected to be completed in 50 years. Ambitious: The new six runway design will increase Mexico City's passenger capacity to 120 million per year . Symbolic: The design features a lightweight membrane, X-shaped roof and a garden of cacti with snake and eagle elements to represent the Mexican flag . The old airport can handle only 32 million passengers per year. It will eventually be turned over to the city for recreational and educational use. Mr Ruiz said that construction of the new airport would begin in 2015. President Enrique Pena Nieto said three runaways are expected to be up and running by 2020 and handle 52 million passengers per year. 'The new airport will be a grand work, a symbol of modern Mexico,' he said. Design team: British architect Lord Norman Foster (2nd left) and Mexico's Fernando Romero (left) are pictured showing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto their design . Staggered opening: The first three runways will be open by 2020, with the remaining three by 2050 . Critics of the massive project say the land where it would be built is not suitable for a new airport. Former environment secretary Jose Luege said that part of Mexico City is prone to flooding. Mr Ruiz denied that and said impact studies have already been conducted and that there are plans to set up areas where rain water can be harvested to avoid floods. It will be 'a modern, on the vanguard (project) that will have a great dose of Mexican symbolism and that without a doubt will be a reference around the world and a great door' into Mexico, Mr Ruiz stated. Mexican officials said they hope the new airport becomes the main air hub in Latin America. Looking forward: President Enrique Pena Nieto said the new airport will be 'a symbol of modern Mexico' New function: The current airport, six miles away, will be turned over to the city for recreational and educational use . Lord Foster, who has received some of the world's top architecture awards, including the Pritzker, said the airport will have spacious halls that can be used for art exhibitions. Mr Romero, who designed Mr Slim's Soumaya museum, said the airport will honour the Mexican flag's coat of arms, which has an eagle on top of a cactus that is devouring a snake and is a reference to Tenochtitlan, the pre-Columbian city where the capital is built on. In 2002, the government tried to expropriate the land from a group of farmers on the outskirts of Mexico City to build a new airport. But after violent clashes with the farmers from the town of San Salvador Atenco the government dropped the airport plan. The airport proposed by Mr Pena Nieto's administration will be built on government land.","Foster's designs with Mexico's Fernando Romero chosen for project .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Snejana Farberov for MailOnline . Scorching lava from one of the world's most active volcanos on Saturday continued to creep slowly but steadily through cracks in the earth toward a rural community on Hawaii's Big Island. Scientists warn that if the lava flow from Kilauea continues on its path, it could reach a small patch of residential homes in about a week. Kilauea, the youngest volcano on Hawaii Island, has been continuously erupting since 1983. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates Kilauea's first eruption happened between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . Red-hot danger: In this Sept. 1, 2014 photo released by the U.S. Geological Survey, fluid lava streams from the Kilauea volcano in Pahoa, Hawaii . Path of destruction: The lava, flowing from Kilauea volcano, is currently threatening the Kaohe Homestead subdivision and the town of Pahoa . Lava could reach the Kaohe Homesteads, a sparsely populated subdivision, in four to six days after new vents on the volcano's northeast flank were spotted June 27. Lava has been flowing underground, filling cracks and then reappearing above ground farther down the flank. The lava has flowed about 8.2 miles from the vent, coming within a mile of the eastern edge of the Wao Kele o Puna Forest Reserve. Officials have estimated that with the lava moving about 820 feet a day, it could reach homes sometime next week. On Friday, Hawaii County Civil Defense officials took a helicopter flight over the area and said the lava was moving very slowly with very little vegetation burning. They said the flow had advanced only about 150 yards since the previous day. While the agency has yet to issue an evacuation order, some people are trying to move livestock out of the subdivision, including cattle, pigs and horses. Some residents decided not to tempt fate and leave the area before it is too late. 'I'm afraid the lava will head towards the highway,' Nicholas Novak tells KITV. 'Otherwise, we wouldn't be leaving.' But some local residents announced during a town hall meeting Thursday that they are intent on staying put and letting Mother Nature take its course, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. 'We're feel like it's Pele doing what Pele does,' said Kaohe Homesteads resident Graywols Claire, referring to the volcano goddess, . Gov. Neil Abercrombie on Friday signed an emergency proclamation in preparation for lava crossing a major highway, which could cut off access to communities in the lava's path. His proclamation could allow officials to open abandoned roads as alternate routes. This is not an eruption at the caldera, the things that make for stunning pictures as deeply red lava spews from the mountaintop. Instead, it is lava slowly moving down the volcano's flank through a heavily forested area. The forest's thick tangles of vegetation and tall trees make it difficult to see, said Janet Babb, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Volcano Observatory. This map shows the direction of the lava flow from Kilauea directly towards the community . Volatile: Kilauea, the youngest volcano on Hawaii Island, has been continuously erupting since 1983 . Under threat: The subdivision that lies in the path of the lava flow is in Puna, a lush, agricultural district where papaya is a major crop . Officials do not yet know exactly how many homes could be threatened by the lava flow, and they are conducting door-to-door interviews in the Kaohe Homesteads to get a count. The subdivision is in Puna, a lush, agricultural district where papaya is a major crop. Everyone in the district about a 30-minute drive from the coastal town of Hilo lives on the volcano. Officials have warned residents in the greater Puna region to be on alert because the lava could change direction and threaten other communities. The state Department of Health advised residents near the lava flow to prepare for smoke from burning vegetation and low levels of sulfur dioxide. The smoke could trigger respiratory conditions. Why would someone live on an active volcano? Unlike Honolulu, the state's biggest city on the island of Oahu, the Big Island's Puna region still has affordable land and can offer a more rural way of life. Located on the island's southeast side, the area is made up of subdivisions like Kaohe Homesteads that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock that are not maintained by the county. 'It's got a country-style living that appeals to people and that's somewhat rare in Hawaii,' county spokesman Kevin Dayton said. 'People there live off the grid on solar and catchment water systems. It's sort of an independent type of person who's willing to rough it a little bit.' People who live there also know the risks. Dayton said there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones. No one knows for sure if the lava flow will stop, change direction or hit homes. It also is difficult to predict when the flow will stop or if it will start again from another vent. This Aug. 12, 2014 photo released by the U.S. Geological Survey shows a fluid lava stream within the main tube of the June 27 lava flow from the Kilauea volcano . Slow but deadly: Officials have estimated that with the lava creeping about 820 feet a day, it could reach homes sometime next week . In the 1990s, about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from Kilauea. The last evacuations from the volcano came in 2011. One home was destroyed and others were threatened before the lava changed course. Kilauea is home to Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. At a community meeting Thursday, some residents expressed anger at suggestions to divert the flow. They say it's culturally insensitive to interfere with Pele's will. Officials with Hawaii's tourism industry say there's no need for potential visitors to alter their vacation plans. The lava flow is an isolated event and won't affect plans to snorkel, surf or tan.","Lava flowing from Kilauea volcano is threatening the Kaohe Homestead subdivision and the town of Pahoa on the Big Island .

"By . Anucyia Victor for MailOnline . Tucking into fresh, local produce should be part of the holiday experience. But it seems Britons prefer to stick to what they know. According to a new study, one in ten holidaymakers resorts to cooking British dishes when abroad because their family won't eat foreign food. A quarter of them (24 per cent) cook a traditional roast, while 21 per cent rustle up fish and chips.

"By . Catherine Eade for MailOnline . A former 83-bedroom hotel that was once the pride of a Welsh seaside town is going under the hammer at a knockdown price of just £250,000. Featured in the BBC/S4C drama Hinterland, the seafront Grade II listed building in Aberystwyth began life as the Queen's Hotel in 1866 and served more recently as council offices, a magistrates' court and a police station. Boasting a large entrance hall with a Gothic staircase, the building - called Swyddfa'r Sir - has three storeys and a basement. Under the hammer: The 83-room Grade II listed building started life as the Queen's Hotel in 1866 and served more recently as council offices, a magistrates court and a police station . Gritty drama: Crime series Hinterland featured the former Queen's Hotel as a police station . The ground-floor windows have quartz and ore panels beneath them, there is an abundance of extravagant stained-glass on the mezzanine, and  original ceramic sinks and brass taps in the ground floor toilets. The building extends over 41,980 sq ft, and has been on the market for 18 months with an asking price of £1million. But because there have been no takers the building is now going to auction in London on September 18 with auctioneers Allsop with an asking price of £250,000 - the average price of a three-bedroom house in the area. Chris Mackenzie-Grieve, the chair of Aberystwyth Chamber of Commerce, is one of many who have questioned the guide price. 'This is an incredibly low price for a building of that size and location. I think the council was originally going for £1m, so this will be an absolute bargain,' he said. 'Having said that it will depend on the planning restrictions placed on it and how much would need to be spent to develop it. Prime location: The seafront hotel which was once the pride of Welsh seaside town Aberystwyth is going under the hammer at a knockdown guide price of just £250,000 . 'For a prime seafront property it has to be a bargain if sold for that amount. Let's hope they have advertised it and canvassed it widely in order to attract enough bidders.' The building has been empty since the council opened its new office five years ago at Parc y Llyn and the magistrates' court was moved to the marina. The council had previously said it would be prepared to sell the yard and the buildings at the site, which in the past were used by Craft, to any purchaser of Swyddfa'r Sir, suggesting it could be used for parking. Aberystwyth mayor Brenda Haines says she is keen that the iconic building be put to use for the long-term benefit of Aberystwyth. 'Obviously the sellers have taken into consideration the current market, and the price reflects this,' she says. 'I appreciate that a lot of money will have to be spent bringing this building up to the standards that comply with current legislation, whatever the use.' Television stars: 'Police officers' Wendy Shaw, Ken Slocombe and Nick Mosley featured in Hinterland, left, which used the hotel as a police station. Right, the 83-room hotel is the same price as a 3-bed semi . For an extra £450,000 the successful purchaser can also buy the former police yard on Queens Road potentially to use as a car park. Aberystwyth councillor Ceredig Davies said it was important the building was brought back into use. 'Agents have failed to find a buyer for this iconic and historic property which could potentially now be bought for the price of a domestic house,' he said. 'It's a lot of building for a quarter of a million pounds and it will be disappointing if it does not realise more than this at auction. 'What the buyer will also have is the substantial costs involved in adapting or converting 'the Queens' into something that is commercially viable. 'Whilst hoping for the best price possible, my wish would be that the building will come back into use whilst retaining as much as possible of its character and original features."" Councillor Mark Strong said, 'In a prime position as it is, at the heart of Aberystwyth's seafront, it is a tremendous building. 'I only wish the local authority was not placed in the situation where it has to sell it as there is not the money to develop it ourselves. That is the real pity.'","Hotel featured as a police station in crime series Hinterland .

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . A couple returning from their dream holiday were forced to endure a three-hour wait for their luggage at Birmingham Airport in the early hours of the morning with their two young children. Carl and Emma Macdonald, from Solihull, West Midlands, say their plane landed just before 1am on Monday but their suitcases did not arrive on the carousel until 4am. In that time, they were 'stranded' with their two young children and around 100 other passengers in the baggage reclaim hall, after staff allegedly told them they could not leave and pick up their luggage the next day. Angry Carl and Emma Macdonald endured a three-hour wait for their luggage at Birmingham Airport . Long wait:  Mr and Mrs Macdonald got to Birmingham airport just before 1am and only left at 4am . Carl, 36, and Emma, 33, had spent £3,000 on a two-week holiday in Cyprus with daughters Taloula, aged one, and Summer, nine. They flew back with Monarch Airlines and landed in the early hours of Monday morning after a four-and-a-half-hour flight. Mr Macdonald, who works for a glasses company, said: 'We'd originally booked with Thomson but their flight was overbooked so they put us on a Monarch plane instead. 'We got to Birmingham just before 1am, went to the baggage reclaim hall and sat and waited for our suitcases to come on the carousel. We waited and waited and eventually they came out at 4am.' According to Mr Macdonald there were around 100 other passengers in the same position, many with young children. Mr MacDonald asked if  his family could leave the airport and return later, but the airport staff said no . 'Taloula's nappy needed changing but we didn't have any spare nappies in our bags so couldn't change her,' he said. 'We kept asking the airport staff what the delay was and all they'd tell us was that it was due to only having three baggage handlers on duty. 'But a Thomson flight arrived from Tenerife while we were waiting and they all got their suitcases straight away.' Mr MacDonald explained that they asked if they could go away and pick up their bags later and were told no. 'She told us we couldn't leave the airport without our suitcases so we were stranded there all night even though we only live five minutes away,' he said. 'In that time, we didn't get offered so much as a glass of water.' A spokeswoman for Monarch said she was unaware of any delays getting baggage at Birmingham during that time. 'But if customers have any feedback, it's helpful they let us know through our customer services team so we can look into any issues,' she said. The couple had booked with Thomson but their flight was full so they were put on a Monarch plane . A spokesman for Menzies Aviation, which handles Monarch's baggage, apologised to the Macdonald family. He said: 'Two inbound flights made substantially delayed arrivals at around 12.30am, alongside another which was scheduled to land at the same time. 'This created a period of heavy congestion for our baggage team at the airport, which had a knock-on effect on the handling of baggage for the Larnaca flight when it arrived at around 1.10am. 'Further to this scheduling issue, our eight-person crew also sustained two sickness absences.'","Carl and Emma Macdonald, from Solihull, had been on holiday in Cyprus .

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . Blocking people in is not the most obvious way of getting them to leave. But it worked for one farmer, who forced a group of travellers off his land by surrounding them with tractors. Chris Awdry took direct action when a group of six caravans arrived in his field on Wednesday afternoon. The 53-year-old initially turned to police for help – but they said it was a civil matter and declined to get involved. Taking action: Farmer Chris Awdry, 53, took direct action when travellers took over his land and told him to take them to court - so he barricaded them in with his tractors and they asked to leave . Direct action: Mr Awdry said that the police had said they couldn't help so he 'had to deal with it' So . he instructed his workers to drive tractors, trucks and diggers around . the edge of the 1.5-acre site to block in the travellers as police stood . by. And less than three hours after their arrival, the group decided to depart. Yesterday . Mr Awdry, who rents the land in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, said: ‘They went . in and they were ruining the land and we wanted them out. The owner of . the land didn’t want them there and we did what we could to protect the . land. ‘I had asked them nicely to leave but they said they wouldn’t and that I would have to get a court order to move them on.’ He . added: ‘I contacted the police and they said it was a civil matter. We . then decided to barricade them in until they went, with the police in . attendance the whole time to keep the peace.’ Once officers saw what was . unfolding, they advised the travellers of section 61 of the Public . Order Act. The law can be invoked when they are satisfied two or . more people are trespassing on land and the owner has taken reasonable . steps to make them leave. Mr Awdry added: ‘I was glad we managed to sort . it quickly and peacefully. ‘Luckily, it happened on a day when we . were not so busy harvesting, so we were able to act straight away, . although even if it had been a busy day we would have still dealt with . it.’ A farmhand said motorists beeped their horns in support as they saw . the caravans leaving. This aerial image shows the 1.5 acre field in Trowbridge, Wiltshire where the barricade took place . The farmer, who rents the site, circled in red, said it took place on a day when they were not busy harvesting, meaning they could act straight away . One of the travellers said they had only stopped off for food and to allow their children to rest. Inspector . Alan Lumley added: ‘They were peacefully dispersed without the . necessity of us using police powers. The local land controller has been . spoken to and no offences have been disclosed.’ He added: ‘We always try and resolve such matters peacefully, although we do have powers to remove them if needed to.’ It . is not the first time people power has been used to move on travellers. In June around 50 villagers took part in a four-hour protest to prevent . a group from settling on their green. After 11 caravans arrived in . the picturesque village of Nepcote, West Sussex, the residents . surrounded the land and blocked off the entrance with their cars. Although . some of the travellers got through, the villagers managed to prevent . the majority from  parking up. And after several hours, the campaign was . victorious, with police serving an eviction notice forcing the group to . move on. However during the tense stand-off, some homeowners were . warned by the police they could be charged with false imprisonment for . blocking the travellers. One eyewitness said at the time: ‘The . villagers took it upon themselves to fight and not let anyone go in. They blocked the only entrance. It was a great result.’","Chris Awdry, 53, asked travellers to leave but they said he must go to court .

"By . Lucy Jones . I want it all. Somewhere hot, but not too hot. Somewhere I can explore, with a room I never have to leave. Somewhere with delicious local cuisine and international delicacies. I want a menu of activities, and a menu for the spa. Somewhere brimming with culture, but only sometimes. And I don’t like children. Well, I do like children. But not on my holiday. In the past, my holiday experiences have included an array of sulking, strops and – very occasionally – compromise. This is the one time of year when I wish to do whatever I want, whenever I want. Feeling blue: The Sensatori Crete resort occupies a prime position on the north coast of the island . So can Thomson’s Sensatori resorts save all my problems? These are places designed for those who cannot make up their mind – or for mixed groups with varying requirements (it is not a prerequisite that guests must have a split-personality disorder and be utterly selfish. That’s just me). I have ventured to the original Sensatori resort, in Crete. Upon arrival, the champagne is free-flowing – although possibly only to distract guests from the snaking check-in queue. Ah bubbles, they make annoying things more pleasant. Come in and splash: The resort has six pools, meaning guests can take a dip at any moment they please . I am inhaled into this alluring atmosphere in quite a different manner from that in which Heraklion airport spat me out. Smooth, calm and – that check-in queue aside – organised. The lobby hall oozes opulence – marble pillars always do. There is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a Grecian theme to the complex. There is an old-fashioned glamour about the place too. The staircases swoop and spiral, looping inwards down to the lower floors. The friendly receptionist hands over several bits and bobs, leaflets, key cards and the like. My favourite of these is the VIP card to the private lounge, complete with wifi, waiter service for drinks and a distinct sense of dignity. Check-in complete, I am led by one of the uniformed team, back out of the main entrance and to a building on the left. In front of me is a pool – one of six, lit up and glowing turquoise in the cool evening air. I wonder if children are allowed in that one. And here's me, today: Lucy enjoys a moment by the sea (left); the pretty harbour at nearby Heraklion (right) And if they are not, will I get told off for bombing in? As I walk to the end of the corridor, I am growing nervous. So far, I have been taken in by the haze of pleasure. It is like my rational self has been clouded with the idea of warm bread rolls and genuine politeness. No-one is ever this relaxed before reaching their room on holiday. I’m being silly. The sheets are going to be stained, and I’ll be forced to fight each night with the TV remote, which will certainly have a mind of its own. And the shower will blast hot then cold, and never reach a plausible temperature. Disappointment is nigh. The key card works! This is usually my first problem. Every hotel. Without fail. A sense of space: Rooms are generously proportioned, with sparkling sea views . Wait. There’s something over in the corner, distracting me from the actual room. A foreign body? It can’t be. It is! My luggage! It has arrived before me! I focus on the room. It is beautiful. The modern, slick living space has a chaise-longue, a flat-screen TV and an arrival platter of fruits and wine. It opens onto a balcony that looks over another pool, and the sea. There is a slight covering just in case a little shade is required. Oh, and my favourite part – there is a small private pool up a few discreet steps. The bedroom is dreamy – as I’m sure my sleep will be. There is another balcony off this ocean-front room. Tomorrow I will wrap up in my fluffy robe and sit right here to watch the sunset. The beach is so quiet and the waters are waving. We’ll see you soon, they say. I decide to go to the (very) detailed meeting for guests, which help them learn how to ‘Sensatori’. We are told the term is a concoction of two words. ‘Sense’ refers to the way in which the hotel has (apparently) been designed with the idea of enticing all five senses – smell, taste, hearing touch, sight – in mind. ‘Satori’ is a Japanese word that can loosely translate as having a ‘sudden enlightenment’. Room for self-improvement: The resort appeals to all five of guests' senses . Perhaps Thomson have set their hopes a little high. They want me reach enlightenment while smelling aromas, tasting fabulous flavours, hearing sweet sounds, touching, erm, soft things, and seeing beauty. This seems a lot to ask of a simple holiday. But, (wo)manfully, I get to work. I follow my nose (let us call this ‘Sense One’) to the first of seven restaurants – the main dining room – for breakfast. I ogle the fresh fruit, pancake station and continental counter, but settle on a naughty pile of bacon and egg on toast. Yum. Taste buds engaged (Sense Two). Stomach largely engorged. Still deliberating on whether enlightenment will be more imminent if I sit by the beach in my kaftan or in the pool on a lilo, I notice the personal trainer talking to some of the hotel guests. I peruse the activity timetable. I could wake up for yoga every morning. Well, I could try. It’s certainly nice to have the option, isn’t it? A spot of Downward Dog could be the best way to reach enlightenment. I always have good ideas when upside down. As evening slides in, I decide to dally with elegance by having dinner at the a la carte restaurant. The food is fine-dining, with live music to set the mood. Resident performers are on hand to sing and keep my ears happy (Sense Three) – in case I become bored of hearing the ocean waves (unlikely). In the lap of the (Greek) gods: Lucy managed to rouse herself from her sun-lounger on occasion . I find myself drawn to the spa. I do not fight this. My muscles are melted with marjoram and oils by a lovely lady whose fingers are made of magic. The massage soothes my skin (Sense Four), and holds me somewhere between sleep and limbo… . I think I fall asleep. Oh well, at least I’m rested for the night. I am donning my most goddess-like outfit and heading to a local taverna for some grub. And while I enjoy a gorgeous tomato omelette, tzatziki, meats, fried potato and cheese, I reflect on what Sensatori means. Thomson do not just want to offer a nice hotel. They want it to be a perfect hotel, in a perfect setting, with perfection at every turn. Perfect. The walk back to the hotel is filled with beautiful sights (let us not forget about Sense Five) – but my favourite thing to look at is the other guests. I don’t think I see one tantrum all week. Not even from the babies. Just pure contentment. Apparently, there is a new Sensatori resort in Jamaica. My sixth sense is telling me to start saving now.

"By . Val Hennessy . LIFE OF A CHALK STREAM by Simon Cooper, (Collins £16.99) As the poet pondered: ‘What is this life if full of care/We have no time to stand and stare . . .’ What indeed? So hats off to conservationist Simon Cooper who stands and stares for much of his working life, frequently up to his bits in bogs and marshes, as he marvels at the beauty abounding in England’s chalkstreams. Cooper stares at the world of wetlands and swamps through the rose-tinted specs of a passionate Nature lover. Simon Cooper writes about the joys of fishing, surrounded by Nature in the great British countryside . That irritating cloud of pesky midges hovering over the water that you or I swat away appear to Cooper as one of the world’s wonders. For him each midge is a creature of beauty with its impressive mandible and translucent veined wings. Those tussock clump thingies along the river bank that sprout thin razor-sharp blades that cut your ankles to shreds are, for Cooper, precious refuges for insects and tiny mammals. Shake a tussock and more than 60 species fall out. Chalkstreams, found mostly in Southern England, are unique. They flow through chalk land, their water springing from natural reservoirs thousands of feet below ground. Cooper is a leading chalkstream conservationist and much of his book describes such daunting chores such as scything, unblocking, replanting, de-clogging, grave-refreshing, oxygen checking and so forth. Flowers and otters are two of many sources of inspiration for author and nature-lover Simon Cooper . And talk about hazardous! Stinging wasps, hissing swans, tussocks ripping his hands, nasty chest-high nettles... Cooper braves them all. He describes rescuing an angry bat — bats carry the rabies virus, remember — from a fishing hook. The bat opens its snarling mouth, exposing a vicious jaw full of sharp incisors, and Cooper grasps the hook with forceps and deftly twists it out in one move. Then there’s the oozing mud problem. Cooper has learnt that the worst thing to do when crossing a boggy bit is to adopt a bold stride. Do that and you’ll fall face down into the slime. His tip is to shuffle forward until reaching ‘firm bottom’ (Oh, give me firm bottom any day of the week . . .) Simon Cooper enjoys fishing despite the pesky midges that hover over the water . Speaking of oozing mud, each step Cooper takes releases a terrible pong — part methane, part rotting vegetation. All that river-bank Nature, fermenting and decaying, is exceedingly whiffy, as are the hawthorn hedges which ‘emit the most awful stench like rotting corpses’. The bane of chalkstream restorers are the invaders. There’s the dread Himalayan Balsam plant, whose rampant growth kills all native plants. He yanks it up by the root. Another invader, the American mink, arrived in 1930 having escaped from fur farms. This furry killing-machine is wiping out all our dear little mice, voles and moorhens. Cooper sees magic in every river crawler, creeper, clinger and digger. As for eels, who knew that they make a weird slurping sound as they Hoover up insects? Herons, otters, the mating rituals of sticklebacks, the Mayfly dance, the spawning habits of salmon, the skills of angling are all, for Cooper, a source of inspiration and wonder. Nature might be red in tooth and claw and occasionally whiffy but Cooper’s enthusiasm is so infectious that by the time you finish his book you have put tussock-shaking, hawthorn fly-stroking and eel-spotting at the very top of your Bucket List.","Simon Cooper takes a look at the world through the rose-tinted specs of a passionate Nature lover .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A police officer who was captured on video pointing his semi-automatic rifle and threatening protesters in Ferguson, Missouri has resigned. Lt. Ray Albers, who worked for the St Ann Police Department for 20 years, was put on indefinite leave from the St. Ann Police Department after video emerged of him swearing at protesters. But he resigned on Thursday after the city's board of police commissioners met and recommended to the board of aldermen that he be fired or quit, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Albers had been among the officers called in from neighboring areas to deal with the protests after Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson gunned down 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9. Scroll down for video . Threats: Lt. Ray Albers, a 20-year veteran of the St Ann Police Department, was seen raising his gun and swearing at protesters on August 19. He has now resigned from his position . Captured: In the video, the police officer could be heard telling the protesters: 'I will f***ing kill you' 'I'm not condoning [Albers'] behavior whatsoever,' Chief Aaron Jiminez said on Thursday, the Post-Dispatch reported. 'It's very hard because he is a good friend, he was a good boss. 'There's going to be those who didn't like him who are high-fiving now. Altogether it's going to be a black eye on the city of St. Ann because he represented our department.' On August 19, Albers had been captured in a video - that was later shared to YouTube -  showing him with his gun raised and telling the crowd: 'I will f***ing kill you. Get back.' When asked his name, he responds: 'Go f*** yourself.' He only lowered his gun when a senior approached him and instructed him to put it down - an interaction that noted by the protesters. Under control: He eventually put his gun down when instructed to by a senior officer. Authorities said before the cameras started rolling, protesters had thrown urine at the cop. He had also seen a man with a gun . Jiminez explained that, before the video started recording the scene, protesters had thrown water and urine at the police officer. He then spotted a man wearing a bandanna and carrying a gun. Victim: The protests came after Michael Brown, 18, was gunned down by a police officer on August 9 . After hearing a gun shot - not from the gun the men were carrying - he raised his own weapon and the group started to record him, Jiminez said. They were 'waiting for something stupid to happen, which they got,' he said. 'They won on this one.' He said that the officer became worried when the crowd got close, but that his choice of language was still inexcusable. Jiminez added that if the incident had happened at any other time, he and the board believed Albers would have only been suspended without pay, the Post-Dispatch reported. 'He solved burglaries, homicides, stealings, you name it, the guy did it,' Jiminez said. 'He chose to work 14-hour days... Bottom line is... I have to do what's best for the citizens.' Albers' resignation comes after another police officer was fired in relation to the unrest. Glendale Officer Matthew Pappert lost his job on Thursday after he commented on his Facebook saying the protesters should be 'put down like rabid dogs'. In another comment, he said: 'Where is a Muslim with a backpack when you need them?' Pappert later apologized, saying he was 'deeply remorseful' for the comments.","Lieutenant Ray Albers, a cop for 20 years, was filmed pointing his gun and telling protesters 'I will f***ing kill you!' in clashes on August 19 .

"By . Peter Lewis . PHILIP LARKIN: LIFE, ART AND LOVE by James Booth (Bloomsbury £25) This biography begins by stating that Philip Larkin is the best-loved and most quoted English poet of the past century. I doubt this claim is quite justified — what about Betjeman? But what is true is that his reputation suffered after the publication of his letters in 1992 and Andrew Motion’s ‘official’ biography in 1993. Larkin had always appealed by being outspoken. Two of his best-known lines are ‘Sexual intercourse began in 1963’ and ‘They f*** you up, your mum and dad’. Literary great Larkin is often misunderstood in the 21st century according to biographer James Booth . They hardly do justice to his elusive, melancholy, often tender poems — his finer sensibilities were, in turn, contradicted by some of the rude, purposely Philistine letters to friends such as Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest. These were often meant as a joke. His Eeyore-ish comments on life’s irritations sometimes included casual swipes at immigrants or expressions of warm approval for Enoch Powell. His biography made it plain he kept at least two women, sometimes more, dangling without intending to marry anyone. Suddenly, this favourite poet seemed, in private, to have been a selfish, foul-mouthed, lecher with a taste for pornography and racist remarks. I welcome the way this biography blows away this dark cloud, revealing that it was mainly composed of hot air, misunderstanding and the picky prejudices of ‘political correctness’ of the Nineties. We really need to know no more than the fact that all Larkin’s friends, lovers and colleagues consulted by James Booth simply do not recognise the ‘Mr Nasty’ version of him. Those close to him remembered him, without exception, as ‘witty, entertaining, considerate and kind’. Surely some mistake has been perpetrated? After all, the poems, gloomy though some of them are, could hardly have been written by what one critic called ‘the vile mess that was Philip Larkin’. He was an unusual type for a poet. His huge owl-like spectacles beneath a bulging bald dome, coupled with bicycle clips and an overlarge bike, hardly made for a romantic exterior. Larkin wrote hundreds of heartfelt love letters to his mistress Monica Jones, evidence he was not a misogynist . He also had a bad stammer that made him shun public appearances and readings. It was thought puzzling that he spent his working life as a librarian — and most of that at the University of Hull, far from the centre of the literary scene. But nothing could have suited him better. He enjoyed his work, just as T. S. Eliot enjoyed working in a bank. He was an efficient administrator, overseeing a magnificent new library. As for Hull, he liked its dullness (‘very nice and flat for cycling’) and inaccessibility at the end of the railway line: ‘People can’t get at you’. It suited him to be the hermit of Hull because he could get on with his poems. If this makes him sound a cheerless recluse, it was relieved by the almost wholly female library staff, for whom he was a lively and much-fancied boss. Secretary Betty Mackereth had a relationship with Philip Larkin for 18 years . There is a photo in which Larkin sits in front of two rows of eagerly smiling girl assistants. Two of them became his mistresses. Sexually, Larkin was a late starter. He waited years for his first love, Ruth Bowman, to grow out of her school days; they reached sexual consummation as she took her Finals. He got to the point of proposing to her, only to withdraw the proposal two days later, when he promptly departed to a new library job in Belfast. He wrote beautiful thank-you-and-goodbye letters — ‘Oh dear, oh dear, you were wonderful’ or ‘Our two years were the most wonderful I’ve known’. You can almost hear the relief with which he used the past tense. His unyielding motive in love affairs was to avoid lifelong commitment. He was not, as some have suggested, a misogynist, but a misogamist, a hater of marriage — something inside refused to let him tie the knot. He suffered feelings of guilt because of it. At Leicester University he became entangled with a lecturer of flamboyant style called Monica Jones. Her emphatic spectacles and intelligence matched his own. When new jobs separated them the affair carried on in the way he seemed to have preferred — by correspondence. He wrote hundreds of letters. When he got to Hull things were complicated by the addition of Maeve Brennan, a library assistant who worshipped him. Because of her strict Roman Catholic principles, she tried to stop short of pre-marital sex (but seems to have yielded on occasion). For years this triangle chimed uneasily on. He admitted he was a self-centred person ‘conducting an affair with one girl, getting mixed up with another, heedless of the feelings of either’. His excuse was that both women were dependent on him and ‘kindness’ stopped him dismissing either. ‘It is my unwillingness to give myself to anyone that’s at fault — like promising to stand on one leg for the rest of your life’. What was not at fault was his determination to put poetry before everything. For poetry he needed regular solitude. And from time to time most poets seek a fresh muse. Both women knew of each other’s existence, but neither wanted to be free of him. To this menage, he was to add a third. His relations with Betty Mackereth, his secretary, had lasted 18 years when suddenly, in their 50s, it became physical — much to her surprise (‘We were good buddies’). Booth explores these emotional shifts and complexities fairly and sympathetically. Why Larkin should have been condemned for them beats me. All the women were free to leave, but they stayed close until he died. Much of the book is about the finest of his poems, which Booth submits to technical analysis as well as appreciation, rather more of it perhaps than the general reader requires. As a man, Larkin emerges by no means whiter than white. As he put it in a ‘Glum Letter’ to Monica: ‘God! Some day someone will perhaps explain what went wrong. I can’t believe I am so much more unpleasant than anyone else.’ He wasn’t — and he isn’t now.","Rude letters to friends Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest were misunderstood .

Sheridan Smith is terrified that one day soon the world will declare her a fraud. ‘I spend most of my time feeling like I’m totally blagging it through life,’ she admits. ‘I didn’t go to drama school. I just wing it. And I honestly do feel out of my depth. ‘So I keep my head down. I don’t want anybody to spot I’m not a real actor.’ When she collected an Olivier award for best actress in 2011, for her West End starring role in Legally Blonde, she blurted: ‘I don’t think I deserve to be here.’ Sheridan in 2009 with her one-time co-star and lover James Corden . Coming from other actresses, this might be just fishing for compliments. But the cracks in Sheridan’s self-confidence go much deeper, affecting not only her career but also her private life. Single since parting four years from her last acknowledged boyfriend, Reg Traviss — Amy Winehouse’s former lover — she admits that at 33 she has started to feel an urge for motherhood. But she cannot believe that, after so long living alone, with a demanding job and a passion for her pets (a pug called Barry Manilow, a Japanese Spitz named Trish, and Enid, a Chinese shar pei) any man could want to share his life with her. ‘I’ve become a crazy dog lady from Crouch End,’ she frets. ‘What man wants to take on three dogs as well as me? Dogs are more loyal than men. And they’re less trouble. I’m happy with the dogs.’ She claims that attempts at dating over the years have been less than successful. One man turned up for dinner wearing socks and sandals; another threw up drunkenly over her dress on the bus. Not one of these dates amounted to much. There has been nothing to match her emotional two-year affair with her Gavin & Stacey co-star James Corden, which was intense and draining. Sheridan has maintained a dignified silence about the trauma of their repeated break-ups, but Corden has been less coy. There were no half-measures in their life together, he says: it was always ‘true love or deepest heartbreak’. Sheridan with Ralf Little at the 'The Ladykillers' play after party in 2013 . ‘She is an incredible actress,’ he wrote in his autobiography. ‘Unbelievably talented. Funny, and absolutely intoxicating to be around. I loved her more than I ever knew was possible. ‘Each time we got back together the love would be more intense; and then, of course, the break-up would be all the more heart-breaking.’ They finally split in 2009. Sensitive, wary and unsure of herself, Sheridan may still be nursing wounds from this emotionally exhausting merry-ground of break-up and reconciliation. Her lack of confidence seems at odds with her upbringing. She comes from a supportive and hugely affectionate family. When she was starring in Legally Blonde, her mother would organise buses to bring her friends and family to see the show. These were riotous excursions with everyone dressed in high heels and feather boas. Her parents, Marilyn and Colin Smith, work as a country ’n’ western duo called The Daltons, and from the age of four Sheridan was singing on stage in the local clubs with them, standing on a stool so the audience could see her. Even today, there’s nothing she enjoys more than an impromptu song with her family. While filming Cilla in Liverpool earlier this year, she joined her brother Damian’s band, The Torn, at a pub in Liverpool’s Penny Lane, to belt out a Dolly Parton classic, Working Nine To Five. There was, however, heartbreak in this otherwise happy, noisy childhood. Her other brother Julian, ten years her senior, died from cancer when she was just eight. Sheridan has a tattoo on the inside of her wrist in his memory — a pair of angel wings with a halo. The actress admits she finds the tragedy hard to talk about, but she has just finished filming The C-Word, a drama celebrating the life of her friend Lisa Lynch, who died last year after a five-year battle with breast cancer. The role required her to shave her head — and, typically, she seized the opportunity to do something unpredictable. A week before she was due to go bald, she dyed it green, blue, pink and then purple — and turned up to the Baftas with a lurid mohawk. Sheridan in character as Cilla with Melanie Hill as Big Cilla, Aneurin Barnard as Bobby Willis and John Henshaw as John White . Sheridan at the BAFTAs in 2013 with her mother Marilyn who has been very supportive of her career . She called it ‘liberating … I can enjoy all the different styles it will go through before I’m back to being me’. This clash of extroversion and insecurity lies behind everything she does. Even before she reached her teens, her talent was obvious. She went to dance classes near her home in Epworth, Lincolnshire — ‘right bang between Doncaster and Scunthorpe’. Her secondary school drama teacher urged her apply to the National Youth Music Theatre, which led to her first major part, in the musical Bugsy Malone. She was Tallulah, the gangster’s moll played by Jodie Foster in the movie. In 1997, aged 16, she moved to London, sharing a two-bedroom flat with five other young actors and singers. She collected an Olivier award for best actress in 2011, for her West End starring role in Legally Blonde . One of Sheridan’s first jobs was at the prestigious Donmar Warehouse, in the Stephen Sondheim musical Into The Woods playing Little Red Riding Hood. Damian Lewis, later the star of Homeland, played the Wolf. Sheridan admitted that until she turned up at the theatre for rehearsals, she’d imagined the show would take place in a real warehouse. It was an understandable mistake from a no-nonsense Northern lass who thought ‘RP’ stood for ‘Right Posh’ rather than ‘Received Pronunciation’. With a fake tan and extensions plaited into her hair, she played Anthony’s (actor Ralf Little) girlfriend in the BBC sitcom The Royle Family. An eight-year stint in the raucous comedy Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps followed, also with Little, who became a long-term friend. She began to fear she had been typecast, condemned to play ‘scrubs, chavs or slappers’ in sitcoms such as Benidorm and Gavin & Stacey, in which she played James Corden’s gobby, tracksuit-wearing younger sister. But her career took a sudden upward swing with the West End smash Legally Blonde — as Elle, the madcap peroxide blonde who amazes everyone by becoming a top lawyer. The demands of the role looked impossible, with 18 musical numbers and a frenetic plot. But Sheridan handled it with consummate brilliance. Two phrases cropped up again and again in the ecstatic reviews — ‘A star is born’ and ‘Much better than Reese Witherspoon in the film’. This success alerted Trevor Nunn to her talent. He cast her in Terence Rattigan’s wartime weepie, Flare Path, at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2011, and sensational reviews followed. One night Dustin Hoffman came backstage and reduced her to tears of disbelief with his praise. To prove these were not empty words, he cast her in his first film as a director, Quartet, with Maggie Smith, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon. She went on to do Ibsen at the Old Vic, encouraged by the theatre’s artistic director Kevin Spacey, and starred as Titania in A Midsummer Night’s Dream opposite David Walliams as Bottom. Sheridan lost her older brother to cancer when she was just eight years old. She recently shaved her head to film The C-Word, a drama celebrating the life of her friend Lisa Lynch, who died last year after a five-year battle with breast cancer . Yet she is still crippled by self-doubt. Following an appearance on Jonathan Ross’s chat show where he ambushed her with a family video of her on stage singing at nine years old, she tweeted: ‘Oh I can’t stop crying. Hate myself sometimes, just can’t be myself. I can only play characters. Wish I had more confidence when I’m being me.’ She has collected shelfloads of awards, including two Oliviers and a Bafta. The acclaim seems to do nothing for her confidence, however. When she was presented with an honorary doctorate from the University of Hull, she said: ‘I’m thrilled — but I left school when I was 16, and all the graduates here today have worked so hard and thoroughly deserve their degrees. They make me feel a bit of a fraud.’ Perhaps one day Sheridan will learn to trust the judgment of others. In the meantime — though she might not believe it — the whole country thinks she’s just fabulous.","Sheridan had an intense on-off relationship with her one-time co-star  James Corden .

"By . Marcus Berkmann for MailOnline . WOULD THEY LIE TO YOU? by Robert Hutton (Elliott & Thompson £9.99) Remember when politicians were taken seriously? I can, just about, and I still have most of my own hair and teeth. For younger readers, though, honesty and integrity in politics are merely the stuff of legend. We know they existed once, like smallpox, but they have long since been eradicated from the general population. It’s a sad state of affairs, but Hutton’s brief and brutally funny book shows how it has come about. Famous fictional spin doctor Malcolm Tucker unleashing his wrath in an episode of the BBC's The Thick of It . Hutton is Bloomberg’s UK political correspondent, and has been listening to politicians, their advisers, flunkeys and cheerleaders for longer than he cares to think about. Only rarely, though, and probably by accident, has he heard the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. His book is a guide (supposedly in its 14th edition) for government high-ups who need to learn how to dissemble, obfuscate, distract and confuse. Not that they would need such a guide. Being able to do those things seems to be the prime qualification for getting the job in the first place. ‘The world can be divided into people who make complicated ideas seem simple, and people who make simple ideas complicated. Whatever area you choose, from finance to academia to the church, you’ll find that glory, money and power flow more freely to the complicators than the simplifiers.’ We, too, can succeed through obscurity. ‘Not by lying. Lying is dangerous if you’re caught, and it’s quite unnecessary. You can steer a truck through the gap between the lie and a simple truth.’ Hutton’s book teaches us how to load that truck. When asked about his relationship with Tony Blair, Gordon Brown famously stonewalled the interviewer . His ‘building blocks of uncommunication’ include the Statement of Fact, which is a truth placed before your audience not to impress in its own right, but to act as scaffolding for all the more important things you want left unsaid. In 2006, Gordon Brown was asked if he was happy with the way Blair was giving up power. ‘It’s a matter for him and the Labour Party,’ said Gordon. ‘It’s not really a matter for me at all.’ The interviewer pressed him further about his relationship with the great man. ‘We’ve been working with each other for more than 20 years,’ said Gordon. ‘I’ve been Chancellor while he’s been Prime Minister for nine years, and we continue to work together.’ Brilliant stonewalling, by any standards. Politician-speak, in fact, has become so coded that it’s essentially another language — what you might call the language of uncommunication. Hutton has examples coming out of his ears. ‘I can’t promise that’ means ‘There is no way in hell that I’m ever going to do that’. As Matthew Parris points out in a pithy introduction, the best satire tells us things we already knew . ‘This is the right thing to do’ means ‘This is the thing we’re going to do’. ‘We need a grown-up debate’ means ‘I will only engage with people who agree with me’. He is also full of good advice: ‘True success is the result of talent, good luck and hard work. Two of those you can’t count on, and the other one is a lot of effort. Much better to take credit for a success that has already happened, ideally one close to where you were standing.’ Is this too cynical? I think not. As Matthew Parris points out in a pithy introduction, the best satire tells us things we knew in our bones already. In this case, we also know many of them from Yes Minister and The Thick Of It, but they’re worth hearing again. I particularly liked Hutton’s suggestions for the ‘rebranding’ of certain historical events. The Crusades become ‘Breaking Down Barriers Between Faith Groups’. Henry VIII’s marital strategy was ‘Sustaining Families Through Wider Engagement’. And ‘Creating Critical Mass to Drive Demand for Safe Technology’? That’s Chernobyl. If one or two of our politicians emerged from their bubble long enough to wonder why voters regard them with disdain, this book would be the perfect place to start.","For younger readers, though, honesty and integrity in politics are merely the stuff of legend .

"By . Peter Lewis . IN MONTMARTE by Sue Roe (Fig Tree £20) Montmartre. Two syllables which still pack a little shimmer of magic. It was a hill apart – la Butte – where life felt different from in the rest of Paris. Here most of the famous names of modern art from Picasso downwards had at some time lived and gone hungry. Sue Roe knows every inch of Montmartre then and now. Starting in 1900 she follows its inhabitants’ adventures and hardships, triumphs and disasters, from street to street and bar to bar till she reaches 1910. A little shimmer of magic: Most of the famous names of modern art have at some time lived in Montmarte . Her narrative is like watching a newsreel of clips of old footage, some of which you’ll have seen before but never assembled in one continuous loop to scroll down. Many books of art history get boring because they proceed endlessly from picture to picture or get tangled in knots of theory. This book skates lightly over such matters as Cubism, saying what usefully can be said in words and no more. The key pictures are given their due, though they are shockingly under-illustrated. All the time the caravan moves on diverting us with the rows, the love affairs, the rivalries, the fights, the parties, the drunken bouts. If you don’t know it all already this is a reliable, entertaining guide to a period when artists discovered new ways of seeing and of expressing themselves. The fascinating thought is that they were still unknown and unappreciated. They could hardly sell their pictures for a few hundred francs, which today would command millions of dollars if they weren’t already in museums. Dominating the scene and the period were Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso with their respective ‘bondes’ — or gangs — of followers. During this decade Matisse was by far the most successful and well-known of the two. Leader of the modernists: Pablo Picasso's work now sells for millions . He was 30 when he arrived in Montmartre with a wife, Amelie, and already had two children. Amelie devoted herself to his career and kept them solvent by modelling hats in a shop. With his solid beard and moustache, his round spectacles and the frock-coat she made him wear, Matisse looked the essence of reliability. He was nicknamed by the other artists ‘le Docteur’ though his nature was more daring than most others’. The two big art shows of the year were the Salon des Independants and the Salon d’Automne. Matisse electrified them in 1904 by showing ‘Mme Matisse’ in a huge floral hat with a stripe of pale green paint running down the centre of her face to the end of her nose. This uninhibited use of colour applied to landscapes and interiors, where such colour did not occur in real life, shocked the public and the critics. One reacted by calling Matisse and his followers ‘les Fauves’ — the Wild Beasts. Their canvases were too shocking to sell except to a few patrons. Recognition came slowly. Nobody would have nicknamed Picasso ‘le Docteur’. He was 19 when he paid his first visit from Barcelona, a slight, small, uncertain-looking youth with a blob of already receding dark hair. He hardly spoke because he knew no French. All that was recognisable from our familiar images of him were his black voracious pools of eyes. When he came back to Montmartre in 1904 he found Fernande Olivier, a tall, redheaded model. He spent nearly a year persuading her to leave the sculptor she lived with to share his studio. She found a place of unutterable squalor with barely any furniture and every surface crusted with dirt and squashed paint tubes. There was a white mouse who lived in a drawer. Unutterable squalor: One of Picasso's muses once found a white mouse who lived in a drawer . Once he had got her, Picasso would not let her model for other painters. He had seduced too many models himself to risk it so Fernande devoted herself to a life of leisure, reading novels and demanding perfume and chocolates whenever he made a sale. Picasso waited on her like a dog. They were often caricatured as a couple because she towered above him. She also dominated him as his Muse for the seven years they were together. Once, during a row, she shook him until his buttons fell off. But it was mainly a peaceful partnership; the opium they smoked saw to that. Sue Roe loves describing low-life in lip-smacking detail and she has a great cast to bring on — characters like the wild bacchanalian artist Modigliani, the child-like visionary Henri Rousseau and the beady-eyed writer Gertrude Stein, who claimed that she sat for Picasso 90 times for her formidable portrait. The author claims too much for Montmartre’s role in the artistic revolutions of the time. By 1910 its artistic importance was over. Picasso and Fernande were rich enough to move to the Boulevard Clichy and employ a maid. And the artistic centre had crossed the Seine to Montparnasse.","Most of the famous names of modern art from Picasso downwards have at some time live in montmarte .

Since ditching long-time girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki, 24, as she was planning their wedding in May, McIlroy has been building a reputation as something of a ladies man. The multi-millionaire has revealed that what happened was 'for the best in terms of my golf.' But he was recently romantically linked with receptionist Sasha Gale, who is from Lisburn, County Antrim, a city just the other side of Belfast from where he grew up. Prior to that, he was spotted out with model Nadia Forde, fuelling speculation they were an item. Pictures taken from outside the hotel showed him cuddling up to one brunette wearing a white bodycon dress.And more recently, McIlroy was last month seen out in Manchester as he and a friend joined a group of pretty women at the Lowry hotel at 3am after a Saturday night out.

McIlroy's latest comment about his relationships with women came as he spoke alongside fellow Northern Irish Major champions Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell for a documentary to be shown on BBC2 tomorrow. In a sneak peak seen by The Sun, he also told how his growing fame forces him to put a 'shield up' when he is out in public. McIlroy's 'virgin' joke was, of course, not original.

"By . Associated Press . Bishop Blase Cupich, who has struck a moderate tone on divisive social issues, was appointed the archbishop of Chicago on Saturday, succeeding a cardinal with an aggressive approach to the culture wars. Cupich, of Spokane, Washington, will take over leadership of the Archdiocese of Chicago in November, succeeding Cardinal Francis George, who has been battling cancer and has said he believes the disease will end his life. Cupich is Pope Francis' first major appointment in the U.S. and the clearest indication yet of the direction he wants to steer American church leaders. Bishop Blase Cupich, 61, will be named the next archbishop of Chicago . The Chicago archdiocese is the nation's third-largest and its most important, serving more than 2.2 million Catholics. Chicago archbishops are usually elevated to cardinal and are therefore eligible to vote for the next pope. George is especially admired in the church's conservative wing as an intellectual who took a hard line against abortion and gay marriage. Francis has said he wants church leaders to focus more on mercy and compassion and less on hot-button issues. At a Chicago news conference Saturday, Cupich pledged to consult with local Catholics as he leads them. 'All my mistakes in life have come from when I've decided on my own, `This is how things have to go,'' he said. Newly-appointed Archbishop of Chicago, Archbishop Blase Cupich left, listens as Cardinal Francis George, retiring leader of the Archdiocese of Chicago right, speaks during a press conference in Chicago, Saturday . Speaking in Spanish, he urged swift action on immigration reform, noting that his grandparents had come to the U.S. from Croatia. 'Every day we delay is a day too long,' he said. About 44 per cent of the archdiocese's parishioners are Latino. Cupich played down any broader significance about why he was the pope's choice. 'I think he sent a pastor, not a message,' Cupich said. Still, the Rev. John Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, said Cupich 'will be a pastorally dedicated, theologically astute and visionary leader in line with Francis' transformative papacy.' In 2012, during the run-up to the . Washington state referendum that ultimately recognized gay marriage, . Cupich repeatedly underscored church teaching that marriage should be . between a man and a woman. Newly appointed Archbishop of Chicago, Archbishop Blase Cupich speaks to the media after it was announced that he would replace Cardinal Francis George . But he also wrote at length to parishioners about the suffering of gays and lesbians because of anti-gay prejudice, and he condemned violence and bullying that has led some gay teens to suicide. 'I also want to be very clear that in stating our position, the Catholic Church has no tolerance for the misuse of this moment to incite hostility toward homosexual persons or promote an agenda that is hateful and disrespectful of their human dignity,' Cupich wrote. In a letter last year on the Obama administration's birth control coverage rule for employers, Cupich said faith-affiliated groups should never be forced to provide services that the church considers morally objectionable. However, he condemned threats by some U.S. church leaders that they would shut down social service agencies over the Affordable Care Act. 'These kind of scare tactics and worse-case scenario predictions are uncalled for,' he wrote in a letter to diocesan employees. 'I am confident we can find a way to move forward.' Cupich, 65, is one of nine children and a native of Omaha, Nebraska, where he was ordained a priest. Francis Cardinal George speaks as his successor Archbishop-Elect Blase Cupich listens during a press conference in Chicago . He holds degrees from The Pontifical Gregorian University and The Catholic University of America. In the 1980s, he worked on the staff of the Vatican embassy in Washington. He was appointed bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1998, and served there until 2010, when he was appointed to Spokane. Cupich also served as chairman of the U.S. bishops' child protection committee at the height of the clergy sex abuse crisis and as church leaders were putting in place a toughened policy on disciplining guilty priests. In a news conference, he said he was ""committed"" to healing the wounds from the crisis and pledged to 'work hard on this and make it an important part of my ministry.'","Bishop Blase Cupich, known for being  a moderate on many hot button social issues, named to the position .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Hospital staff witnessed a teen mother choking her newborn baby twice, and investigators say the abuse was acted out in an attempt to get attention. On Monday, Florida prosecutors released video showing 19-year-old Brenna Winter admitting to police that she choked her baby on purpose. While doctors fought to revive the girl who stopped breathing, Winter started posting on Facebook, sharing pictures of her child and telling her friends that the girl almost died. The baby, who has not been named, was rescued by nurses after the second attack and has been placed in foster care. Scroll down for video . Abuse: Teen mom Brenna Winter (right) stands accused of trying to strangle her daughter twice, while the newborn girl was in the hospital . Confession: Police interview video released Monday shows Winter admitting she choked her daughter 'for attention'. Winter pictured in green, on the right . Winter, of St Cloud, dropped out of school at the age of 18 to take care of the newborn, but told police that she became stressed trying to provide for the baby without a job. Behind bars: Winter has been in Orange County jail since June without bail. She stands accused of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and battery by strangulation . Her mother was helping take care of the child as well, but got behind on work assignments and  Winter felt like she was becoming a burden. Last June, Winter took her child to Nemours Children's Hospital on two consecutive days, June 1 and 2, complaining the child was vomiting blood. The child was admitted to the hospital on the second visit when staff found a small cut 'of unknown origin' at the base of the child's esophagus. Then, just after 6pm on June 6, the baby stopped breathing, setting of an alarm for hospital staff. Nurses looked at the livefeed camera in the baby's room and saw Winter with her hands in the child's crib. They rushed into the room and were able to get the child breathing again and the mother was allowed to stay in the room. But just a few hours later, a sitter stationed in the room witnessed the mother 'breastfeeding' the child and 'holding [the girl] so tightly that [her] heart rate dropped]' - setting the alarm off again. After one of the incidents, Winter posted a picture on Facebook of doctors attending to her child, writing that her girl 'stopped breathing and was turning blue. I can't stop shaking. There [sic] helping her now. God that was scary. I almost lost my baby girl.' Winter was interviewed by police after the incident, and she initially defended her actions. She claimed she was just trying to help the congested baby breathe when she was first noticed with her hands in the crib. 'When they said they saw me in the video with my hands on her, I was trying to make sure she was breathing. I wasn't trying to stop her from breathing,' a crying Winter told detectives. Protected: Doctors were able to resuscitate Winter's child, and the baby girl has since been placed in foster care . Attention grab: While doctors were working to resuscitate her child, Winter started posting pictures to Facebook, telling her friends how the baby girl almost died . But she later admitted to seeking attention, she police pressed her about the second incident. When she was breastfeeding the baby, Winter said 'I held her too close and she couldn't breathe'. Police then asked her if she 'got a lot of attention' after the nurses came in, and Winter said 'Yeah'. 'That was your intent, because you can't handle the baby, is that right? Is that a yes?' a detective asked. 'Yeah,' Winter said again. 'I was just really stressed out and I wasn't thinking, but I wasn't trying to hurt her,' Winter said. 'I was stressed out and I was trying to relieve the problem but I knew that wasn't gonna work...' Winter has been in Orange County jail since June, held without bail. She faces charges of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and battery by strangulation. Her trial is set to begin in November.","Staff at Nemours Children's Hospital witnessed new-mom Brenna Winter, 19, choking her baby twice .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . and Reuters . Thousands of eco-activists piled into Wall Street today in protest over links between financial institutions and climate change. The environmental campaigners dressed in blue and hoped to 'flood' the lower Manhattan financial district with their message, the day after more than 100,000 joined a climate change march through New York City. Three of their number were arrested by the NYPD, and officers had to use pepper spray on the crowds to stop them pushing past metal barricades to keep them away from traders at the New York Stock Exchange. Scroll down for video . Protest: Hundreds gathered on Wall Street today to hit out at financial institutions' involvement in climate change - they are pictured here surrounding the iconic Charging Bull statue . Crowd control: NYPD officers used pepper spray to hold back protesters trying to get near the New York Stock Exchange . Under arrest: This protester was dragged away by the NYPD at the event in Manhattan's financial district . Some protesters were pictured clashing with officers over the barricades, and later being dragged off - while many others sat down in the street and waved banners to get their message across. The 'Flood Wall Street' protest has roots in the Occupy movements that started in a downtown Manhattan park in 2011 to protest what it called unfair banking practices that served the wealthiest in America, leaving behind 'the 99 per cent'. 'Flood': Many of those protesting wore blue to make a visual statement while marching on the stronghold of capitalism . Concern: An activist dressed as a polar bear to warn of the dangers to some species from rising temperatures . 'Fossil fools': Protesters, some of whom wore makes, attacked fossil fuel industries such as oil and fracking . Kai Sanburn, a nurse from Los Angeles, 60, said she had traveled to New York for Sunday's march and wanted to do more. She said: 'Marching is wonderful but to really change things we really need to change things'. 'The action here against Wall Street is really expressive of the feeling that corporations and capitalism no longer serve people.' Urban farmer Ben Shapiro from Youngstown, Ohio, says he came to 'confront the system.' March: Protesters began in Battery Park, NYC, and continued along Broadway in the financial district . Standing guard: Hundreds of police were posted to Wall St to keep the financial centers working as usual . Getting steamed: NYPD officers stand at the barricades and await the protesters . Scuffles: Three activists were arrested during the day, while others clashed with police trying to force back metal barricades . Flood Wall Street organizers said they hope Monday's action will draw a link between economic policies and the environment. They accused top financial institutions of 'exploiting frontline communities, workers and natural resources' for financial gain. The event is part of Climate Week, which seeks to draw attention to carbon emissions and their link to global warming, and it comes ahead of a United Nations Climate Summit tomorrow. Shall not be moved: One protester lay down in the street with an Occupy-style mask placed on his body . 'Carbon bubble': The organizers brought along props - including a metaphorical 'Carbon bubble' - to make their point . Bubble burst: Police seized the bubble and deflated it during the protest today, in which 2,600 are thought to have marched .","Environmentalists dressed in blue and tried to 'flood' Wall Street .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . A three-bedroom flat shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania is to go on the market for £2.5million. The musicians moved into the apartment in Knightsbridge in 1964 - the year of their first world tour. The pair - who shared with Harrison's then girlfriend, model Pattie Boyd - also briefly lived in two other flats in the central London apartment building.

The two bedrooms and en-suite master offer 'versatile accommodation' in an apartment building which comes with its own porter, according to the agents, but the property 'will require some updating'. Harrison and Starr moved to the London flat at the recommendation of their manager Brian Epstein, who lived upstairs on the fifth floor from December 1963 until 1965. Epstein hosted a number of parties in his top-floor flat including a legendary gathering in August 1964, which all four Beatles, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Judy Garland, among others, are believed to have attended. The celebrations spread to the roof of the building where a temporary ballroom - complete with red carpet was set up in a marquee. Harrison and Starr's flat was burgled on 19 April 1964 while the pair were at a recording session and a party - but little was stolen apart from cufflinks, cash and souvenirs from a trip to the U.S. A year later the Beatles met at the property for a cup of tea before they travelled to Buckingham Palace - less than a mile away - to receive their MBE medals as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours list.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A nurse who was left fighting for her life after being trampled by cows was at first branded a hoax caller when she desperately dialled 999 for help. Sarah Leonard suffered serious injuries including broken arms, a broken collarbone, broken jaw and several broken ribs during the incident in a field near Lincoln last November. A recording of her distress call has been shared online, and it reveals how the Lincolnshire Police call handler dealt with the badly injured lady. Scroll down for audio . Agony: Ms Leonard (left) was left with serious injuries after the incident near Church Lane (right) The call taker is heard to say 'This is a hoax, isn’t it, obviously', after questioning the woman about where she was and what had happened to her. But the call wasn’t a hoax. Sarah nearly died and was in intensive care at Lincoln County Hospital for two and a half weeks. The full call, which is 49 minutes long, stops when officers arrive to help her. Sarah was eventually taken to Lincoln County Hospital. The woman, who was 59-years-old old at the time, had been out on a hi-tech treasure hunt when she was trampled by cows in a field off Church Lane at North Scarle, eight miles from Lincoln city centre. She managed to call 999, and was eventually found after police traced her mobile phone signal. But in a recording of the call, which was posted on Audioboo by BBC Radio Lincolnshire presenter William Wright, Ms Leonard desperately struggles to explain what has happened to her. After asking Sarah what was happening and getting some broken responses, the call operator asks where in Lincolnshire she is calling from. The call operator then says: 'This is a hoax, isn’t it, obviously. Which area of Lincolnshire, we will get your mobile phone checked.' Critical: Ms Leonard's injuries included broken arms, a broken collarbone, broken jaw and several broken ribs . Sarah was walking in a field with her dog when the group of animals charged, leaving her with life-threatening injuries. Now doing research two days a week, a generous Sarah said she did not bear the operator any ill will despite her somewhat unsympathetic tone. 'I presume I couldn't talk properly because of my broken jaw,' she said. 'I broke all of my ribs down my left side I believe, and was in intensive care for two and half weeks.' Sarah was carrying a hand held GPS but assumes the device was knocked out of her reach by the cows. 'I can not remember, but I think because of all my breaks and everything I was in terrible pain so I probably couldn't move very much either.' Sarah added: 'It happened in a field, it was a public footpath through a field in North Scarle, near Lincoln. I wasn't actually using my phone, it was a handheld GPS, I think it was a circular walk of about four miles. 'I suffered lots of broken bones, particularly to my arms and chest, so it was both arms, my collar bone, my jaw, most of my ribs on my left side. 'Somebody said I remembered where I had parked the car and it wasn't far from there,' Sarah said. 'Basically they saved my life.' Sarah’s pet King Charles spaniel Megs was uninjured after she ran off when around a dozen cows charged at them. Her brother, Andrew, found the petrified dog cowering in a bush the following day. Most members of the public are wary of bulls, but few realise that cows, particularly those protecting newly-born calves, can also be dangerous. If you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle, move away as carefully and quietly as possible, and if you feel threatened by cattle then let go of your dog’s lead and let it run free rather than try to protect it and endanger yourself. The dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you. Those without canine companions should follow similar advice: move away calmly, do not panic and make no sudden noises. Chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat. If you walk through a field of cows and there happen to be calves, think twice; if you can, go another way and avoid crossing fields. Source: British Mountaineering Council . Sarah, from Norton, Sheffield, had been ‘geocaching’ - an internet-based high-tech treasure hunt which uses GPS. At the time a Lincolnshire Police spokesman confirmed: 'We received a call from a woman saying she had been injured and was lying in a field. 'She said she had been hurt when cows stampeded and knocked her over. 'Although she didn’t know exactly where she was, within half-an-hour her car was located at North Scarle cemetery. 'And she was found in the field off Church Lane in the village soon after.' In a statement Lincolsnhire Police said: 'Call takers are trained to establish key information as quickly as possible. 'The audio clip only covers the initial few minutes of the call and does not give the full picture of how the injured lady was dealt with. 'The call lasted 48 minutes in total and all the time the caller was being spoken to, background work was going on to try to establish her exact location. 'There was never any delay in the police’s response to the incident and everything was done with urgency to find where the caller was. Whilst all the work was being undertaken to locate the lady, the call taker kept talking to her to keep her calm and reassured, gaining as much information as possible from her. She was kept on the line until help arrived.' Geocaching involves hiding a small waterproof box containing a logbook and a pen, recording its co-ordinates and logging its location on a website. Another ‘cacher’ will see the listing, enter the co-ordinates into their GPS receiver and go in search of it. It is similar to the 150-year-old game letterboxing, which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories. Geocaching was invented in 2000 when GPS readings became more accurate. In total there are two million geocaches all over the world and more than five million people take part in the activity globally.","Sarah Leonard was trampled by cows in a Lincolnshire field .

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . New York City police are investigating an incident caught on grainy video over the weekend in which a visibly pregnant woman is brutally wrestled to the ground and another woman is shoved into a Brooklyn street. The video was taken by a shocked witness and, while fuzzy, clearly shows the woman's growing belly and her harsh treatment by police who said she was interfering with the arrest of her 17-year-old son. The video was posted to the Facebook page of social justice advocacy group El Grito De Sunset Park on Tuesday, setting off an online firestorm. Scroll down for video... Shocking: Some members of a Brooklyn community are alleging some shocking police brutality after a video purporting to show the mistreatment of pregnant woman emerged over the weekend . Struggle: Officers in Sunset Park appear to handle the woman very roughly before she's down on the ground and the officers are on top of her . 'It's heartbreaking,' activist Jason del Aguila, who works with the Brooklyn organization, told NY1. The video had hundreds of shares and likes just hours after it was posted by the group. According to their attorney, the unnamed woman's son--who does have a criminal record--was first manhandled by police as they arrested him for criminal possession of a weapon. Officers then turned to the pregnant woman, who would later get a ticket for disorderly conduct, who then wound up on top of on the ground. The attorney claims the woman suffered bruises to her abdomen. While police were cuffing the mother, another woman approaches them and is clearly knocked to the pavement with great force by one of the two unnamed officers. Fice months pregnant: Officers appeared unfazed by her obvious pregnancy . After she hit the ground and some men came to her aid, she appeared to have some problems standing. 'You broke her arm! That's your badge,' yelled someone behind the camera. As the struggle with the pregnant continued, the ire of the witnesses--of which there appeared to be many--grew. 'She's pregnant,' the appalled passersby yelled before another man was arrested. 'He didn't do nothing,' reacted one witness. As public outcry over the apparent police brutality grows, public officials have already reacted to the video. 'I believe this is systemic. The police commissioner must deal with the 72nd police precinct,' Rep. Nydia Velasquez told NY1. 'What we saw in this video of this past weekend is very disturbing. It's overly aggressive tactics and that is wrong.' It's the second public outcry in a matter of days over alleged police brutality in the police precinct. Just the week before, an officer allegedly kicked a man on the ground in the area during an arrest at a street fair. 'You broke her arm! That's your badge!': Another woman appears to come to the aid of the pregnant woman in the video and a police officer forcefully shoves her to the ground as passersby shout .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Andrew Palfrey, pictured outside court, sent a stream of graphic sexual threats to hospital worker Amanda Prosser . A hospital worker who was sent text rape threats by a phone stalker was 'sickened' to discover the culprit - a colleague's husband. Amanda Prosser, 48, received a stream of graphic sexual threats over an eight week period from the husband of her workmate at Llandrindod Wells Hospital, Powys. A court heard victim Mrs Prosser thought father-of-two Andrew Palfrey, 50, was a friend - and they regularly went out drinking together as a foursome. But Palfrey had a secret grudge because he felt his wife did all the work on the hospital's physiotherapy unit while Mrs Prosser was 'lazy and never in work'. A court heard mechanic Palfrey plagued her with a barrage of 'vile and disgusting' texts over eight weeks. The mother-of-four said: 'These message were horrendous, vile and sick. He said he was going to inject me with heroin, rape me, kidnap me and hurt me. 'They made me suspect everyone around me and made me question my friendships. 'When I discovered it was Andrew I was in shock and sickened. 'I couldn't believe the same man who I'd sat with in our local pub so many times was dreaming up so many awful things to do to me. 'I have been unable to leave the house alone and have been to the doctors as I have had trouble sleeping and been unable to go to work and had anxiety attacks.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mrs Prosser received texts from an unknown number saying she was being watched day and night and would be rapes, maimed and turned into a prostitute. One message told her: 'I will grab you and use you and have my fun.' Another said: 'Make the most of the time you have left with your family.' Prosecutor Rachel Knight said the messages were serious sexual threats with warnings of abduction and rape. She told the court: 'Those messages were extremely distressing for her.' Palfrey was caught when police tracked his pay as you go mobile phone to a newsagents in Llanidloes, Powys, where he had bought a top up card. They showed a CCTV image of the customer to Mrs Prosser and she identified him as her colleague's husband and a friend. The court heard Mrs Prosser works with Palfrey's wife on the physiotherapy ward of Llandrindod Wells Hospital. Palfrey admitted to police he had sent the messages as an act of revenge and had done it for his wife. Amanda Prosser, pictured with her husband Mark, said she was 'sickened' to learn that the person sending her text rape threat was the husband of a colleague at Llandrindod Wells Hospital, Powys . He told officers his wife had to do all the work because Mrs Prosser was 'lazy and never in work'. Palfrey told police: 'I was angry because she was not pulling her weight at the hospital. I wanted to frighten her. 'It was frustrating that she was not replying to the messages and I did not know how she was reacting to them.' The court heard Mrs Prosser had actually only been off sick for two days before he started sending the threatening sexual messages. Palfrey, 50, of Llandrindod Wells, admitted harassment between April 4 and June 16 and was given a six month suspended prison sentence. Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'The messages you sent were some of the worst that can be imagined - they were sinister and menacing. 'One gets the sense that you were deriving some excitement from them especially he sexual element. 'They became more elaborate and were obscene and violent. It is inexplicable why you embarked on this appalling behaviour. 'Life for Mrs Prosser and those around her must have been a living hell. How much more the shock to discover the person who was doing this she thought was a friend. 'I don't think that I have ever come across a case quite like this.' Judge Rees praised Mrs Prosser for her 'great courage' in coming to court in person to describe how she had suffered. Palfrey will have to complete 250 hours of unpaid work and attend a thinking skills course. He was made the subject of an indefinite restraining order that prevents Palfrey from contacting Mrs Prosser in person or electronically.","Amanda Prosser received graphic sexual threats over an eight week period .

Several of the approximately 12 men and women in the group have since met with police. Police released a CCTV image of the group alleged to have hurled gay slurs and beat a second group . District Attorney Seth Williams said yesterday that charges have been approved for three of them: 24-year-olds Philip Williams and Katherine Knott and 26-year-old Kevin Harrigan, all of suburban Bucks County. 'This vicious attack shocked the entire country. An assault on people because of their sexual orientation has no place in Philadelphia,' the district attorney said in a statement. The victims told police that the group hurled gay slurs and beat them when the two parties passed on the street on September 11. One man suffered serious facial injuries, including an orbital fracture, and needed his jaw wired. District Attorny Seth Williams said an assault on people because of their sexual orientation has no place in Philadelphia . All three suspects are being charged with criminal conspiracy and two counts each of aggravated and simple assault, and reckless endangerment. Defense lawyer Louis Busico, who represents Knott, denied that the dispute was motivated by anti-gay bias. He also said his client, who has relatives in law enforcement, did not throw a punch. 'She in no way participated in the assault of anyone,' he said. '(And) she didn't hurl an insult or a slur, of any kind.' Like others seen in the group, Knott graduated from Archbishop Wood High School in Warminster. One man in the group has since stepped down as a part-time basketball coach at the Roman Catholic school. He was not charged Tuesday. 'Violence against anyone, simply because of who they are, is inexcusable and alien to what it means to be a Christian,' Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput, speaking about the case, said last week in a statement. The couple, who have asked not to be named, thanked law enforcement and the community for their support in a short statement released after the charges were announced. 'We are thankful the D.A. is working so hard to make sure this doesn't happen again in Philadelphia,' they said. 'Finally, we ask you to keep your comments regarding the suspects respectful and non-hateful.' Pennsylvania's hate-crimes law does not cover crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, along with openly gay state Rep. Brian Sims of Philadelphia and others, have said the case illustrates the need for a change in the law.","Police posted video of the well-dressed suspects out on the town that night .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . A Premier League footballer was handcuffed by police after being wrongly accused of stealing a tub of £1.85 soft cheese from Tesco. Queens Park Rangers defender Steven Caulker had left the Express store in Weybridge, Surrey and was about to go back in when he was handcuffed by officers. Witnesses say they heard the officers and the 22-year-old talking about the cheese spread Philadelphia. QPR defender Steven Caulker, who was handcuffed by officers after being accused of stealing cheese from Tesco . It is thought police spent five minutes with the player before he was released. One passer-by who saw the incident told the Sun: 'Caulker had left the Tesco Express then turned around and gone back in. 'That was when the police car arrived, jumping from their squad car and handcuffing him.' While another added: 'There were a group of lads watching from across the street who immediately recognised him - and thought it was hilarious.' However, Surrey Police confirmed that no crime had taken place. A force spokesman said: 'It appears to have been a misunderstanding between staff about payment.' Mr Caulker had left the Tesco Express store in Weybridge, Surrey and was about to go back in when he was handcuffed by officers . A spokeswoman for Surrey Police said that the incident involving Mr Caulker, pictured, was due to a misunderstanding between staff about payment . Both Mr Caulker and QPR refused to comment. He had been arrested in 2011 during his time at Swansea during a night out in the city on suspicion of a public order offence. He later claimed he was arrested for swearing in the street and apologised to the club and then-manager Brendan Rogers for his behaviour. He also added that he had learned from the incident and said it wouldn't happen again. While playing for the England under-21 team in December 2012, Mr Caulker was caught up in a mass brawl that broke out at the end of a game against Serbia following accusations of racial abuse. He faced the threat of police action following the incident in Krusevac but was then handed a two-match ban, which on appeal was rescinded. It is thought that police spent five minutes with the former Cardiff City defender before he was free to go . The defender, who is originally from Hounslow, west London, began his career at Tottenham Hotspur. He also had loan spells at Yeovil Town, Bristol City and Swansea City before joining Cardiff City. Mr Caulker, an England international, made his move to QPR in the summer after also being chased by Crystal Palace. He made the £8million transfer from Cardiff City, despite Palace matching the fee and offering wages of around £42,000 a week. But it is thought he opted to join the west London club when they bettered the terms.","Stephen Caulker had been shopping at a store in Surrey when he was cuffed .

"By . Ed Ashcroft . Ahead of the 40th Ryder Cup at Gleneagles this weekend, Ed Ashcroft takes a trip down memory lane to look back at 10 memorable contests staged on European soil. Celtic Manor, Newport, Wales, 2010 . Europe win 14 ½ - 13 ½ . In what proved to be one of the most hotly contested Ryder Cups in recent memory, Europe claimed a dramatic triumph on the immortalised 'Magic Monday' – with drama only to be matched by the 'Miracle at Medinah' two years later. With the competition stretching beyond its usual three days due to the incessant Welsh rain, Graeme McDowell's 20ft birdie putt on the 16th, which led to a 3 and 1 triumph over Hunter Mahan, set up wild celebrations across the home continent. Graeme McDowell proved Europe's hero at the 2010 Ryder Cup as he beat USA's Hunter Mahan 3 and 1 . K Club, County Kildare, Ireland, 2006 . Europe win 18 ½ - 9 ½ . While the emphatic European victory will live long in the record books, the 2006 K Club Ryder Cup will more likely be remembered for the emotional reception received by Darren Clarke. His wife, Heather, had recently died of cancer and following an extended break from the game and a late Captain's pick – which fulfilled his dying wife's wish that he play in the Ryder Cup – he walked to the first tee on day one with most of the crowd in tears. Darren Clarke competed in the 2006 Ryder Cup, not long after his wife had passed away with cancer . A 300-yard drive on the first set up a birdie which would lead to a one-up victory for himself and Lee Westwood over Chris DiMarco and Phil Mickelson, laying the foundation for a convincing European victory. The win was greeted in much the same style with which Darren Clarke approached most aspects of his career – with a pint of Guinness (on the K Club balcony no less) and a smile. Even so, there was a tinge of disappointment for him on Monday morning. He said: 'I'm probably the most sober I've felt on a Monday after the Ryder Cup. I don't know why. It certainly wasn't for the lack of trying.' Clarke celebrated Europe's win at the K Club with a pint of Guinness on the balcony . Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, 2002 . Europe win 15 ½ - 12 ½ . The rescheduled 2002 tournament, which was suspended for a year after the 9/11 attacks in the previous September, returned once more to Belfry – for the fourth time since its debut in 1985 – and it once again proved a happy hunting ground for the home side. With the scores all tied going into the final day, Captain Sam Torrance's decision to place most of his key performers first, as opposed to opposite number Curtis Strange's tactics to delay them, proved decisive, swinging the momentum towards Europe early in the day and leading to a 15 ½ - 12 ½ triumph. Spain's Sergio Garcia was part of the successful Europe 2002 Ryder Cup team that played at the Belfry . Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, 1989 . Tied 14-14. Retained by Europe . With the USA looking to overcome two straight losses suffered in 1987 and 1985, the tensions were palpable. From the off Raymond Floyd, the US captain, declared his golfers 'the 12 greatest players in the world.' Pre-match sparring was then transferred to on-course conflict, as the notorious Azinger-Ballesteros feud was ignited for the first time at a Ryder Cup, beginning with Paul Azinger challenging Seve Ballesteros' attempts to replace a scuffed ball, and culminating with Ballesteros challenging Azinger's drop on the 18th. Seve Ballesteros (left) and Paul Azinger (right) had a fractious relationship during the 1989 Ryder Cup . Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England, 1985 . Europe wins 16 ½ - 11 ½ . Sam Torrance's stout putt on the 18th green, after Andy North had driven into the water with his second shot, confirmed European victory and brought to an end 28 years of Ryder Cup hurt as American supremacy over the tournament was finally broken. Sam Torrence (centre) celebrates Europe's first Ryder Cup victory after 28 years . Walton Heath, Surrey, England, 1981 . USA win 18 ½ - 9 ½ . Although this was the first match on European soil to include continental Europe, it was less than a triumph for the home team. Facing a US side with 36 majors between them – 36 more than the European team had mustered – the thunderstorms on day one were to be an ominous sign for the Europeans, as they were washed away by the largest margin ever on British soil, 18 ½ - 9 ½. Jack Nicklaus (right) was imperious form as USA trashed Europe 18 1/2 - 9 1/2 at the 1981 Ryder Cup . Royal Birkdale, Southport, England, 1969 . Tied 16-16. Retained by the USA . Following disastrous 23 ½ - 8 ½, 19 ½ - 12 ½ and 23 – 9 losses in the previous three Ryder Cups, 1969 at Royal Birkdale was welcomingly competitive – as well as memorable. Going down to the last hole, Jack Nicklaus sunk a four foot putt, leaving Tony Jacklin to putt for a tie. Yet in a remarkable demonstration of sporting spirit, Nicklaus gave Jacklin the putt, saying 'I don't think you would have missed that Tony, but I didn't want to give you the chance.' The USA retained the 1969 Ryder Cup with Lee Trevino (centre) helping them to do so at Royal Birkldale . Royal Lytham and St. Annes, Lancashire, England, 1961 . USA win 14 ½ - 9 ½ . In this Ryder Cup, the first to be played on an Open Championship golf course, 10 of the matches went to the 18th green providing an exhibition of intense golf for the eager 35,000 on-lookers enjoying the October sun at the Royal Lytham and St Annes course. Yet it was to prove more significant as a landmark, as it became the final Ryder Cup to be played out in a two-day format, before the rule changes were introduced. The 1961 Ryder Cup  was the first to be played on an Open Championship golf course and in a two-day format . Southport and Ainsdale, Southport, England, 1933 . Great Britain and Ireland win 5 ½ - 6 ½ . The moment when Syd Easterbrook overcame Denny Shute in dramatic fashion on the 18th green – two-putting from 30ft to Shute's three-putt – was to live rather longer than expected in the British golfing memory. Although unbelievable at the time, Great Britain and Ireland would not win again until Lindrick in 1957, marking the longest era of American golfing supremacy in the Ryder Cup. Great Britain and Ireland's victory against USA in the the 1933 Ryder Cup was their last for 24 years . Wentworth, Surrey, England, 1926 – First unofficial Ryder Cup . Great Britain and Ireland win 13 – 1 . The match played out between a rag-tag American team and their professional counterparts in 1926 was to initiate a sporting tradition that would extend to the present day. As early as September 1920, Golf Illustrated had requested that the PGA of America send 12 golfers to play their British counterparts at Gleneagles as a warm up before the British Open. Although an international amateur competition between the two nations was established after the Gleneagles tournament in 1922, it was not until Wentworth in 1926 that the idea of a Professional American-British tournament began to gather pace. While called the 'Ryder Cup' in the media due to Samuel Ryder's contribution of a £250 trophy, however, the decision was quickly made that this could not count as an official competition. For starters, the scrappy organisation had put America at a disadvantage, and the team had been put together by Walter Hagan rather than the American PGA. Nevertheless, Samuel Ryder's desire to 'do this again' following the 13-1 British victory was to be fulfilled in triumphant style, starting with the first official, and formally organized, Ryder Cup at the Worcester Country Club in 1927. With that, a sporting classic was born.","2014 Ryder Cup begins on Friday at Gleneagles in Scotland .

"By . Rehema Figueiredo for MailOnline . This weekend's Ryder Cup will be hotly contested between team Europe and team USA. And when it comes to the style stakes, the wives and girlfriends of the golfers take matters just as seriously. The women demonstrated their fashion credentials as they arrived in Scotland this week and pulled out the stops for the  Team Gala Dinner  in Auchterarder. Preparing for the swanky event at the Gleneagles Hotel, Perthsire, Scotland there wasn't a hint of a dodgy boob job or tacky hair extensions as we're so used to with footballers' wives. The GWAGs wore elegant peplum dresses, floor length cowl neck gowns and beautiful sequined cocktail dresses. Scroll down for video . Pink lady: Sergio Garcia of Team Europe and his partner Katharina Boehm, who is also a keen golfer in her native Germany . Angelic: Kate Rose wore a long white gown as she posed with husband Justin . Mother-of-two Kate Rose led the way in a figure hugging white dress, accessorised with a bright blue clutch as she accompanied her husband Justin to the event. The 35-year-old former gymnast married Justin in 2006 and they have two children together, toddlers Leo, four, and Lottie, two. She works with her husband on the Kate and Justin Rose Foundation and the pair split their time between England and Florida depending on Justin's tour schedule. Champion Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia and his girlfriend Katharina also made for a dashing pair as she opted for a bright pink peplum dress with a silver clutch and heeled sandals. Katharina is a keen golfer herself, having been the Bavarian Junior Girls Champion and coming 24th at the European Ladies Championship. But it seems she's happy to take a sidestep for her boyfriend though, having served as his caddy. Denmark's Thomas and Pernilla Bjorn, who wore an unusual cut out layered green dress with a large gold cuff . Going for gold: Europe team vice captain Miguel Angel Jiminez and his wife Suzanne couldn't have looked happier as they posed for photos before the dinner . Having fun: The pair, who wed earlier this year, larked around for photographers, no mean feat in a pair of gold stiletto sandals . Pernilla Bjorn, wife of Thomas Bjorn, wore an unusual cut out layered green dress with a large gold cuff. She married her man in 1998 and raises their three children in Gothenburg, Sweden. The menu for the prestigious dinner included a Perthshire salmon terrine served with whiskey chutney and Scottish honey and Arran mustard followed by a rack of slow cooked Aberdeenshire lamb. It seemed as though Europe's vice captain Miguel Angel Jimenez wanted to get some exercise before tucking in, dancing about with his new wife Suzanne in front of photographers. The Spaniard married the Austrian beauty  at the Golf Academy Miguel Angel Jimenez near Malaga in May. Man of the hour: Ian Poulter of Europe and his wife Katie, who wears a deep blue dress with a sweetheart neckline . Maternity chic: Europe's Henrik Stenson with his heavily pregnant wife Emma in a flattering lace dress . Despite being known for occasional outbursts on the golf course, Ian Poulter looked like a dapper gentleman next to wife Kate who wore a deep blue floor length dress with a sweetheart neckline which perfectly framed her necklace. The pair first met while he was working his way up to attaining his European Tour card. The former nurse married Ian in 2007 and they recently welcomed their fourth child. Meanwhile Sweden's stylish couple Henrik and Emma Stenson perfectly complemented each other. Emma opted for a burgundy lace dress with long sleeves which showed off her burgeoning baby bump. The couple already have two children, seven-year-old Lisa and their four-year-old son Karl. Yummy mummy: Emma Stenson showed off her baby bump in a burgundy long-sleeved lace dress . Expanding family: Henrik and Emma were together for ten years before they got married in 2006 . Henrik and Emma Stenson first met at the University of South California where they were both studying but wed in Dubai in 2006. While her husband's golfing credentials are impressive, having spent over 100 weeks ranked in the World top ten, Emma is also sporty, having been a keen alpine skier before also focussing on golf. It was the couple's shared love of golf that he says drew them together and Henrik describes Emma as ""very talented"" on his website as well as describing the various hobbies the active pair enjoy such as skiing and snorkelling. Dapper: Europe team captain Paul McGinley and his wife Alison, who wears an encrusted collared black shift dress . His and hers in black: Jamie Donaldson of Europe and his partner Kathryn Tagg in a lacy black dress . Henrik and Emma aren't the only sporty couple in this year's European entourage, with team captain Paul McGinley and wife Alison being equally golf-mad. Alison boasts having played for England and on the Ladies European Tour while her husband also plays association football but now raises their three children in Sunningdale, England. She was on hand at the airport to help welcome team USA, alongside her husband and Shona Robison, Scotland's Minister for Sport. Alison wore a jewel encrusted collared black shift dress while Jamie Donaldson's partner Kathryn Tagg also played it safe in a black long-sleeved lace outfit. Leaders of the pack:  Paul McGinley, Captain of the Europe team and wife Allison McGinley (R) talk to Shona Robison, Scotland's Minister for Sport as they wait for the arrival of the United States team at Edinburgh Airport ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles . Though all of the GWAGs loOked glamorous for the gala dinner, don't for one minute think that they are just a group of pretty faces, as many of them carry out charitable work for The Wives' Association which carries out a range of charity work across the country: visiting hospitals and hospices, working with disadvantaged children and families. One former GWAG notably absent from the line up is Caroline Wozniacki - the Danish tennis pro and former fiance of Rory McIIroy.

His meal with Miss Gale, who says online she likes 'fashion, whiskey, sunshine, travelling and fast cars', has buried rumours he was dating model Nadia Forde. McIlroy, of Holywood, County Down, broke off his engagement from Danish sports star Wozniacki, 24, in May, just days after the couple had sent out their wedding invitations. In what some interpreted as a dig at her former fiance, the tennis player recently wrote online: 'It's been three years since I have worn high heels on a normal day out. #feelsgood #looksgood #shopping #highheels'.

By the time the Ryder Cup gets into full swing this week, Gleneagles will have spent 13 years and £20m on staging its finest hour. As the eyes of the sporting world fix firmly on this jewel of the Perthshire countryside, experts predict a flood of golf-mad tourists will pump more than £100m into the national economy as they flock to watch the world’s top golfers do battle. Residents in nearby Auchterarder are determined to get their slice of the action when 250,000 fans arrive for the biennial clash between Europe and the US. About 45,000 spectators are expected every day as US captain Tom Watson’s stars take on Paul McGinley’s European team this weekend. The event will put Scotland in the world’s shop window, as an estimated 500million viewers in 183 countries watch on TV.","Tonight's gala dinner precedes Ryder Cup golf tournament .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A fraternity at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is being investigated on suspicion of giving girls 'date rape' drugs at a party. Three women and a man were hospitalized and suffered black-outs after a Tau Kappa Epsilon party last Friday. Reports claim members of the fraternity had drawn red Xs on the hospitalized girls' hands - and the man who was treated had sipped from one of their drinks. Scroll down for video . Probe: Tau Kappa Epsilon has been suspended by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after a party at the fraternity's residence (pictured) where three girls and a man are believed to have consumed Rohypnol . The group, which was investigated over sexual assault claims last year, has now been suspended by the university as police search the frat house for drugs that cause memory loss 'and other intoxicating effects'. One of the girls who went to the hospital told officers 'she had a weird feeling and sensation prior to blacking out which she had never felt before,' according to the warrant read by CNN. It continued: '[The student] stated she feels victimized by TKE and that she is sure some sort of drug or other intoxicant was given to her against her will and unbeknownst to her.' According to the student, the fraternity had a reputation for putting 'roofies' - or, Rohypnol - into women's drinks but 'she thought it was all in the past'. Another hospitalized girl said 'you have to be hot' to get an $8 access card from the fraternity leaders which warrants free drinks. A third told police someone poured her a drink then moved 'the cup under the bar out of sight; after a few moments the male pulled the cup back on top of the bar and gave her the mixed drink.' Just over 30 minutes later, she blacked out. Rohypnol, a tasteless drug, is colloquially referred to as 'the date rape drug' as it sedates users who then fail to remember what happened during the time that they were under the influence. Police said students could barely stand or walk when they visited the residence three times between midnight and 1.30am on Saturday 13. Warrant: Police are now searching the residence for drugs that cause 'memory loss' following the party . They found 42 people under the age of 21 in the basement with either red or black Xs marked on their hands, CNN reported. The fraternity refused to explain what the Xs or colours signified. The university suspended the fraternity while the investigation is under way, said Tom Luljak, vice chancellor of university relations and communications. 'We are deeply concerned about these allegations because the safety of our students is our number one priority,' he said. 'Our police are aggressively pursuing this investigation to determine exactly what happened and who may have been involved.' The university noted that no sexual assaults were reported in connection with the party. Alex Baker of the Tau Kappa Epsilon International Fraternity said: 'These alleged actions do not align with our values of love, charity and esteem. 'We have temporarily suspended the Zeta-Zeta chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon. We are currently working with university officials and local authorities to ascertain all of the information of the incident.'","Three woman and a man hospitalized during Tau Kappa Epsilon party .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Experts have today called for half-day closing on the high street to be brought back to stop overworked shop employees suffering stress. The move would be familiar to millions of older people who will remember when whole town centres across the UK closed down at lunchtime one day a week to prevent shop staff being exploited. One leading psychologist said the move would have a similar effect today. Professor Craig Jackson, from Birmingham City University, said it would compensate millions of low-paid employees, who put in hours of overtime. Experts have called for half-day closing on the high street to be brought back to stop overworked shop employees suffering stress . He said it could also save the NHS millions of pounds a year in treating those who suffer stress and other conditions related to working too hard. Professor Jackson said millions of employees regularly work through lunchbreaks, stay late or come in early for no extra pay. Many are low paid workers who fear losing their jobs and will put in extra hours for no money in order to show willing. He said: 'The UK workforce still has the highest mean number of full-time working hours of any European country. Professor Craig Jackson from Birmingham City University, said it would compensate millions of low-paid employees, who put in overtime. File picture . 'As a country we work too many hours - and we also rely on the culture of unpaid overtime and the willingness of millions of employees to work outside of the 9 to 5 for free, on a regular basis. 'Working unpaid overtime is now expected of workers in countless organisations, and technological advances facilitate this.' These advances include being contacted by email or text in out-of-office hours and even on holiday. Trading laws from the beginning of the 20th Century limited the hours shops and many business could operate across a working week. This included being shut on Sundays. To regulate these hours, they had to close for half a day during the week, with most areas choosing Wednesday afternoons. This prevented children from working in their parents' shops for more than 72 hours a week, for instance. The law was repealed in 1994 though in some areas, local traders came to a mutual agreement to all close one afternoon a week, usually on the quietest trading day. Professor Jackson added: 'Since the trading laws were relaxed in the 1990s, millions of people in the retail sector in the UK have felt the effects of the shopping culture. 'A suitable remedy would be for companies to voluntarily bring back 'half-day closing' for one day each week. 'It would give workers a break, and allow them to do other beneficial things in their lives, and any lost 'revenue' that may occur as a result would easily be saved by fewer workers needing to access the NHS and their GPs for countless work-related psychosocial issues such as stress.'","Trading laws from 20th century limited hours shops could be open .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . At the age of seven, Sebastian Aguiar weighs the same as a fully grown adult and is three times heavier than he was two years ago. But Sebastian, who tips the scales at nearly 70kg, doesn't gorge on junk food or have an adversion to exercise. In fact, he would love to run around after his friends - that would mean living a normal life. The little boy suffers from Rapid-Onset Obesity with Hypathalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Auto-Nomic Dysregulation (ROHHADS), one of 75 people in the world to suffer from the potentially deadly but rare condition. Weighing a healthy 25kg just two years ago, Sebastian is now almost 70kg and stops breathing without warning - meaning he has to have a tracheotomy tube in his throat and sleeps with a ventilator every night. Sebastian at his fifth birthday (left) before he became ill and in April this year after he put on 45kg (right) Sebastian is too exhausted to play with his toys anymore as he spends a lot of time in hospital . In happier days when he was an energetic lively boy with his brother Jalin (left) Unable to understand why he can't play anymore, Sebastian, the only ROHHADS sufferer in Australia, needs medication to stay awake during the day and to fall asleep at night, is now also suffering from depression as the disease has robbed him of his childhood after spending two traumatic years in and out of hospital. The boy from Hinchinbrook in western Sydney is on medication for his hormones and thyroid which are not producing enough for him to function properly. The condition, which is potentially lethal and incurable, affects the ability to breath and also impacts on the body's temperature, heart rate and blood pressure - therefore Sebastian's oxygen levels can run dangerously low. Sebastian had to have a tracheotomy inserted in December after he almost lost his life. Sebastian (left) now has a tracheotomy tube inserted in his throat pictured with his mum, Luisa, and Jalin .

'He says to me ""Why me Mummy? What did I do to deserve this?"",' Ms Aguiar told Daily Mail Australia. He has also become very self-conscious of the way he looks. 'He doesn't like having photos taken - when he brushes his teeth he closes his eyes so he doesn't have to see himself,' she said. Sebastian's love of playing soccer, swimming and playing with his toys are merely memories now. 'He used to love playing with his cars and trains but he asked him to put his toys away because he's too tired - he just can't do it,' his mother said. Ms Aguiar describes the family's journey as a 'roller coaster' and a 'nightmare'. 'Some days we just scream and cry and say ""why us?"".' But she says her son's determined spirit will get him through. 'He's very stubborn,' she said. 'He's got a lot of fight in him.' Sebastian(right) with brother Jalin (left) often asks his mother why he has become this way . Sebastian now also suffering from depression after spending two stressful years in and out of hospital. However, the good news is his weight has remained stable since February thanks to a restricted diet of only taking in 1,000 calories a day. The only thing that brings joy to Sebastian's life is attending school at St John the Baptist in Bonnyrigg Heights in western Sydney. 'It's the only thing that makes him happy - it gives him a purpose in life,' Ms Ms Aguiar said. 'He gets to be a child after being in hospital so often.' The school has started a fundraising page for Sebastian in a quest to raise at least $100,000 for him to travel to The Lurie's Childrens Hospital in Chicago - his one and only possible hope to increase his quality of life. After more than a year of not being able to find out what was wrong, it was suggested by the Chicago hospital to Sebastian's doctor, who sent the details of his condition around the world, that Sebastian may have ROHHADS syndrome. 'Kids pass away from it which is quite scary but we just have to stay positive and stay on top of the disease,' Ms Aguiar said. 'I'm hoping and praying we can raise the money because I received an email saying the tests will cost up to $200,000.' The fundraising page is currently sitting at $28,000.

"By . Alex Lazcano . and Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . The man who strangled and bashed his ex-girlfriend, Kate Malonyay, to death may have murdered her after she found out he had spun a web of lies about his life during their one-year relationship. An inquest into Ms Malonyay's death also revealed Elliot Coulson - an ex-navy officer - was texting her friends from her phone after her death to make it look like she was still alive. In the messages posing as Ms Malonyay, Coulson was assuring the 32-year-old's friends that she was okay and taking time off work. Scroll down for video . The popular 32-year-old had been strangled and bashed to death in her Mosman home by her ex-boyfriend Elliott Coulson . She had actually been strangled and bashed to death in her Mosman by Coulson, the NSW Deputy State Coroner Hugh Dillon found. 'One of her friends was in the police station [after her body had been found] when she received a text,' he told the Coroner's Court on Friday. Ms Malonyay's bruised body was found in the bed of her Mosman unit on April 22 last year. 'There is evidence of blunt force being inflicted to Kate's head - both the back of the head and the left side of her face and some facial fractures to the left side of the face,' Mr Dillon said. Days after Kate Malonyay was found dead, friends kept receiving text messages from her phone assuring them she was okay and was taking sick leave from her job . Concerned friends had asked police to check on her welfare because she hadn't been seen since leaving work five days earlier . 'Bruises, lacerations and abrasions were found all over Kate's body. Some deep bruises were found on her back on the left hand side.' Concerned friends had asked police to check on her welfare because she had not been seen since leaving work five days earlier. Her phone and credit cards were missing but texts linked to her mobile number were still being sent to her friends. The source was traced to the Marriott Hotel on Queensland's Gold Coast, where Coulson was staying after going absent without leave from his systems analyst job at the navy. When Queensland and NSW detectives went to speak to Coulson two days after Ms Malonyay's body was found, he jumped to his death from his hotel room on the 26th floor. CCTV still of Elliot Coulson withdrawing $500 the day before his ex-girlfriend Kate Malonyay was murdered at her Mosman unit . Ms Malonyay's bruised body was found in the bed of her Mosman unit on April 22 last year . The coroner found DNA evidence, Coulson's flight to Queensland, his suicide, impersonation of Ms Malonyay and his unexplained leave from the navy formed part of the compelling evidence that Elliott Coulson killed Kate Malonyay. The coroner's findings reveal that, in the weeks leading up to her death, Ms Malonyay had learnt that much of what Coulson had told her about himself was lies, and had begun speaking to his family. It was also revealed Ms Malonyay had uncovered Coulson had been lying to her about how much he earned, his job position, his whereabouts and the value of a gift, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. The state coroner said Coulson also pretended his father had a brain tumour and his twin brother had died in car accident. Mr Dillion said Coulson went as far as bringing Ms Malonyay to his alleged dead brother's grave site to keep up the pretense. It is believed Ms Malonyay became aware of Coulson's lies in April 2013 and had started making enquiries about him when she became suspicious. Mr Coulson could not explain his unexpected leave from the navy when Ms Malonyay was killed . Kate Malonyay's phone and credit cards were missing but texts linked to her mobile number were still being sent to her friends . Evidence was also heard from a woman who had been in a relationship with Coulson before, according The Daily Telegraph. She gave a similar account of his compulsive lying behaviour, including erratic tendencies and jealousy. It was one incident in particular that Mr Dillon drew from where the woman told of how Coulson latched onto her hair, shoved her against a door frame and pinned her on a mattress, putting his hands around her throat. The injuries the woman suffered were similar to the one launched on Ms Malonyay. Her death highlighted domestic violence issues and Mr Dillon plans to write to ask NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli to consider introducing classroom courses on abusive relationships. 'If we can help young people understand abusive relationships ... some of those tragedies can be averted,' Mr Dillon said. Mr Dillon passed his condolences to Ms Malonyay's mother, Wendy, for the loss of her 'fine, much-loved' daughter.

"By . Sara Malm . A man who dialled 999 to complain about his McDonald’s meal has been shamed by police. In a recording of the phone call, the man can be heard telling emergency staff he is upset over his hamburger, demanding to be transferred to a Wolverhampton police station. During the nearly two-and-a-half minute conversation, the man argues with the call handler for telling him that his situation is not an emergency - and finishes off my swearing down the phone, . Scroll down to listen to the call . Emburgency: The man phoned 999 from a location in Wolverhampton from McDonald's where he was angry about his hamburger . West Midlands Police have shamed the nuisance caller by releasing audio footage of the phone conversation today. During the two minute 17 second clip the man can be heard asking the emergency call operator to put him through to Bilston Police Station in Wolverhampton. After a lengthy argument with the operator over his refusal to ‘do him a favour’ and transfer him to the ‘cop shop’, the rambling caller eventually reveals the true nature of his emergency. He can be heard saying: ‘I am at McDonald's, I’m asking for ingredients on the meal I’m eating.’ The 999 call handler then interjects and says: ‘This is not a 999 emergency.’ before the man replies ‘Yes it is though.’ The operator tells the man: ‘You needing to get ingredients in the things you are eating in McDonald's is not an emergency.’ At this point the message seemingly gets through to the caller and he replies: ‘Is it not? Okey dokey.’ The man then ends the conversation with an expletive, before the patient operator says: ‘Don’t speak to me like that, please.’ It is the second food related 999 call the force has released recently after a woman phoned earlier in the year to complain about topping on her ice cream. Chief Superintendent Jim Andronov, head of the force’s Contact Centre, warned time-wasters that their calls could cost lives. He added: ‘Typically West Midlands Police receive over 1500 calls a day to the 999 number and our operatives have to deal with each one accordingly. Hangry about un-happy meal: The man was upset over not being able to get the full list of ingredients for the hamburger he had purchased at McDonald's, demanding to speak to a Wolverhampton police station . ‘Of these, some 10 to 20 per cent are not police matters and around 50 per cent are non-emergency calls where contact is appropriate via the 101 number. ‘As well as the bizarre calls police also receive deliberate hoax calls which take up vital time. ‘It’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth. ‘Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but, if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, then a minute is a very long time to wait. ‘I cannot stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only, for guidance this is defined as: a crime is in progress, someone suspected of a crime is nearby, when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened. ‘We do not want to discourage people from contacting the police so for any other reason call 101.’ Caller: ‘Hello mate, are you in the West Midlands mate?’ Emergency call handler: ‘Yes, you’re through to the police.’Caller: ‘Hello, whereabouts are you based?’ Emergency call handler: ‘You’re through to West Midlands Police 999.’Caller ‘Bilston Street?’Emergency call handler: ‘Not Bilston Street the 999 call centre.’Caller: ‘Okay mate do me a favour, you know Bilston Street Wolverhampton cop shop?’Emergency call handler: ‘We don’t transfer 999 calls, do you have an emergency?’Caller: ‘I have an emergency yeah.

Dusan Tadic’s penalty followed by Nathaniel Clyne’s 30-yard thunderbolt secured a deserved victory for Southampton at the Emirates Stadium after Alexis Sanchez’s brilliant free-kick put the Gunners ahead. Arsenal’s back-four has been ravaged by injury in recent weeks; Mathieu Debuchy and Nacho Monreal were confirmed absentees for Tuesday night’s clash, while Wenger revealed following the defeat that Per Mertesacker (gluteal) and Kieran Gibbs (hamstring) were only fit enough for a place on the bench. Hector Bellerin (right) was one of several young Arsenal players thrust into the side against Southampton . Isaac Hayden has a word with the man upstairs as he takes to the field for the Capital One Cup clash . That meant Arsenal fielded a defence consisting of youngsters Hector Bellerin, Calum Chambers, Isaac Hayden and Francis Coquelin - who is a central midfielder by trade. And Wenger said: ‘We lacked a bit of experience at the back. We gave a lot, and it’s frustrating not to be able to score in the second half. ‘We are a bit short at the back, yes, because of the injuries. You sit there and think: Gibbs had a little hamstring problem and we could not play him, Mertesacker is a bit on the edge, and then we have no choice. ‘I think if we lost the game tonight, it’s not because of Hayden, not because of Chambers and not because of Coquelin. You have to be realistic. ‘It’s disappointing because we had a good start and we made two un-needed errors on the two goals, and big ones.

Clyne celebrates scoring his winner as Southampton continued their impressive early season form . ‘When you look at the amount of possession we had, we have to give credit to Southampton, they played well and were well organised. ‘They abused a bit the fouls in the middle of the park, but they are a good side and they played well. ‘We gave a lot, I cannot fault the spirit, the attitude. The first reason of our defeat is the quality of our opponent and the performance of our opponent.’ Meanwhile, Saints manager Ronald Koeman heaped praise on his side following their win at the Emirates Stadium and insisted there was more to come. The Dutchman said: ‘Until now we have showed our ambition and level even tonight. I’m proud of them but I realise football can chang fast and we have to continue like this and keep our feet on the ground. ‘I’m a little bit surprised at how well we’ve started the season, because it is always difficult if you have a lot of changes in the team. ‘You need adaptation time with the players who come in but from the first day we worked hard to have good organisation in the and that is important for confidence.’","Arsenal fielded a weakened team against Southampton .

Commenting on the event page, Troyangel Vydelingum said: ‘I think it’s disgusting, been asked to cover up with a dish cloth as well.’ Katherine Nykola added: ‘He broke the law under the Equality Act. It’s the same law that makes racism illegal. This is a big deal for someone trying to do what’s best for their baby.’ A Wetherspoon spokesman said: ‘We apologise wholeheartedly to the lady.

There are no excuses and we do not offer one. We completely understand that this incident upset the lady in question and hope she accepts our apology.’ Miss Pozniak's Twitter profile describes her as a 'single mama of four perfect babies', adding that she likes 'slings, wine, cake, outdoor adventures and the ever-elusive five minutes’ peace’.

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . Two Palestinians suspected over the abduction and murders of three Israeli teenagers have been killed by Israeli special forces who stormed a West Bank hideout. The deaths of the two well-known Hamas militants, Amer Abu Aisheh and Marwan Qawasmeh, ended one of the largest manhunts conducted by the Israeli security forces. Eyal Yifrah, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Fraenkel, a 16-year-old with dual Israeli-American citizenship, were abducted on June 12 while hitch-hiking home in the West Bank and killed soon afterwards. Palestinians inspect the scene after Israeli troops shot dead two Palestinians, Amer Abu Aisheh and Marwan Qawasmeh, in the West Bank city of Hebron; the men were responsible for murdering three teenagers . The incident prompted a large Israeli crackdown on Hamas groups and set off a chain of events which led to a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In an operation codenamed Brother’s Keeper, Israel dispatched thousands of troops across the West Bank in search of the youths, closed roads in the Hebron area and arrested hundreds of Hamas operatives throughout the territory. The search ended on July 1 when the bodies were found under a pile of rocks in a field north of Hebron. Officials later said it was believed the trio had been killed shortly after their abduction. Israeli army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said there had been a recent breakthrough in the search that led the Yamam, a special police counter-terrorism unit, to the suspects hideout in an area of Hebron about a week ago. Eyal Yifrah, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Fraenkel, a 16-year-old with dual Israeli-American citizenship, were abducted on June 12 and were found dead two weeks later . Earlier today, Israeli special forces entered the ground floor of the two-storey building and killed two Hamas operatives after coming under fire, he said. The military believes both men were killed, though troops confirmed the killing of only one suspect. Lt Col Lerner said the second suspect fell backwards in a hail of fire and is presumed dead, though the body has not yet been recovered. He noted that the two men had been identified as the suspects early in the search and their Hamas connections were well-known. Another three members of one the Qawasmeh family were arrested, he said. Israeli army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said the 'successful mission' bought to an end the long-term hunt for the killers . Lt Col Lerner said: 'We were determined in bringing the ruthless murderers of Gilad, Eyal and Naftali to justice. 'Today’s successful mission brings the long-term search to an end, and the perpetrators of the crime no longer pose a threat to Israeli civilians. In Qatar, Hussam Badran, a spokesman for top Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, praised the two militants on his Twitter account. He wrote: 'The martyrdom of Marwan Qawasmeh and Amer Abu Aisheh came after a long life full of jihad sacrifice and giving. This is the path of resistance, which we all are moving in.' Hamas denied involvement for weeks after the teenagers were abducted. However, during the Israel-Hamas war, an exiled Hamas leader responsible for West Bank operations acknowledged his group had been responsible for abducting and killing them. In the days leading up to the start of the Gaza war in early July, a Palestinian youth was also abducted and killed in east Jerusalem by Israeli extremists in an apparent revenge attack over the youths’ murders.","Deaths ended one of the largest manhunts conducted by Israeli forces .

"By . Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the National Crime Agency has details of  suspects but lacks the resources to investigate them all . The Government’s flagship anti-crime agency is failing to investigate up to 25,000 paedophiles suspected of downloading child pornography, Yvette Cooper said today. The shadow home secretary said the National Crime Agency has details of the suspects but lacks the resources to investigate them all. She told Labour Party conference in Manchester the lack of action could leave children at risk. She said: The National Crime Agency has the detail of over 25,000 people suspected of downloading vile abusive images of children online.’ ‘But they have only investigated and arrested 660 suspects and they say the police don’t have the capacity to investigate them all. ‘But the police arrest 230,000 people a year for theft. 110,000 for drug offences. Why don’t they have the capacity to investigate 25,000 cases where children may be at risk? ‘The truth is this is not just about capacity it’s about priority. ‘Theresa May says crime is falling and we don’t need as many police. I say crime is changing and we need police and Home Office action to keep our children safe. Miss Cooper also said Labour would take action to deport thousands more European foreign criminals including violent thugs – who are currently allowed to remain in the country. At the moment, she said their offences were not deemed serious enough to warrant being kicked out of the country. Labour would ditch the current requirement for criminals to have received a sentence of two years or more – or 12 months for sexual, violent or drugs crimes – before they can be deported. Instead, she said, anyone who commits a crime like common assault – and who has lived in the UK for as little as six months – should be considered for automatic removal. Repeat offenders, such as prolific thieves, could also qualify for immediate removal under the new rules. It also emerged Labour is to hit thousands of pubs and clubs with a late night opening tax – in a blunt admission of the chaos caused by 24-hour drinking laws. In 2003 Tony Blair opened the door to round-the-clock drinking with the claim that it would lead to a European style café culture. Instead, it unleashed a wave of booze-fuelled violence across the country, with police comparing towns and cities to the Wild West. Miss Cooper said drinking venues wanting to open beyond midnight will be forced to cough up thousands of pounds in the areas with the most alcohol licences. It will mean pubs, bars and clubs facing an additional charge of up to £4,400 a year if they want to stay open late. Aides said extending the current Government’s Late Night Levy to 100 areas would raise £12million which would be handed to the police and local authorities to help pay for clean-up costs and put extra officers on the street. The policy was drawn up by Theresa May in an effort to control drinking excess – but it has been adopted by only a handful of councils. Miss Cooper's husband Ed Balls (centre) watches her speech in the conference hall, as she said Labour would take action to deport thousands more European foreign criminals including violent thugs . Labour officials said the levy had proved ‘ineffective’ and only raised ten per cent of the £17million ministers hoped for. A spokesman said: ‘Theresa May talks a good game, but she isn't finding savings to help the police protect the frontline. We want to see proper enforcement of the Late Night Levy for the top 100 licensing authorities.’ However, the move will leave Labour open to the charge that it is trying to put the ‘genie back in the bottle’ from a problem it created. Earlier this month, senior police officers made a desperate plea for moderation in drinking as they admitted defeat in tackling Britain’s excessive boozing culture. The country’s most senior officer responsible for alcohol-related crime called for an end to the attitude which tolerates out-of-control drunkenness as ‘normal’. Chief Constable Adrian Lee also admitted officers’ efforts to combat booze fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘barely scratched the surface’ of a problem that is ‘blighting our communities’. He also called for much tougher action against the alcohol industry, a clampdown on cheap booze and more action to combat criminals with alcohol problems. Since 2007, the number of town centres and neighbourhoods officially classed as being overrun by problem pubs and bars has rocketed by 150 per cent.","Yvette Cooper warns the NCA lacks the resources to investigate suspects .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Innocent bystander: John Wayne Whitmore, 65, was waiting for a train in Los Angeles in June when he was attacked by two women, who beat him with brass knuckles and left him for dead . Two California women have been arrested in the beating death of a 65-year-old man at a train station in Los Angeles two months ago. The suspects in the vicious killing of John Wayne Whitmore have been identified by the Los Angeles County Sherif's Department as Tracy Gomez, 24, and Virginia Butler, 23. Gomez, from Hawthorne, was taken into custody last Sunday and was ordered held on $1,061,000 bail. Butler was arrested Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She is being jailed on $1million bail. The two women are facing murder charges in connection to the attack on Mr Whitmore, an artist from Los Angeles who was savagely beaten while standing on a platform at the Willowbrook Metro station June 13, reported KTLA. On Thursday, Ms Gomez pleaded not guilty to a single count of murder. Her alleged accomplice is expected to be arraigned Friday. According to police, the brutal attack unfolded on June 13 while John Whitmore was waiting for a Blue Line train. It was witnessed by dozens of people, who reportedly did nothing to help the victim. Investigators said Gomez and Butler approached the 65-year-old bystander and began arguing with him. Case closed: Sheriff's officials in Los Angeles apprehended Tracy Gomez and Virginia Butler, pictured in stills from a surveillance footage, in connection to the beating death . The verbal dispute quickly escalated and turned physical, with the 24-year-old Gomez allegedly using brass knuckles to beat up the stranger without any provocation. After Whitmore collapsed on the platform, the two women blended with the crowd and vanished. Police released a surveillance video and still photos hoping the public could help them identify and locate the culprits. A $10,000 reward was also announced for information leading to the attackers. Investigators asked for the public's help and offered a $10,000 reward to help find the perpetrators . Mr Whitmore passed away from blunt-force trauma to the head 10 days later at St. Francis Hospital. ‘He was a talented artist who was merely running his errands,’ stated a sheriff’s department press release. A criminal complaint filed against Tracy Gomez revealed that the woman was convicted of second-degree robbery in 2009. She could face life in prison if convicted in John Whitmore’s beating death.","Tracy Gomez, 24, and Virginia Butler, 23, are facing murder charges in deadly June 13 attack .

"By . Victoria Woollaston for MailOnline . It seems this unique type of moth has brains as well as beauty - by disguising its wings to resemble the head of a poisonous snake. Decorated with patterns and markings, the tips of the Atlas moth's wings strike an uncanny resemblance to the curved shape of a cobra's head. And these defence mechanisms don't end there. When the insect is threatened, it drops to the ground and fans its huge wings in a movement that also looks similar to that of the snake's head and neck. Decorated with dazzling patterns and markings, the tips of the Atlas moth's wings (pictured inset) strike an uncanny resemblance to the curved shape of a cobra (pictured main) These similarities are so striking that in China, the Cantonese name for the mighty moth translates to 'snake's head moth'. The wingspan of a female Atlas Moth can reach up to 12 inches (30cm) with a surface area of 62 square inches (400 square cm). Female Atlas moths are much bigger than males and attract mates by secreting irresistible pheromones through the end of their abdomens. The males sniff these out with a long, feathery antennae. The moths lay their eggs underneath leaves. Bluish green caterpillars, covered in a white powder, then hatch a week or two later and start eating. Photographed resting on the tip of a leaf by UK wildlife photographer, Brian Bevan, 64, the rare insect is typically found in the tropical and subtropical forests of South East Asia. Known for its incredible size as well as its markings, the species has the largest wingspan of any moth in the world. The wingspan of a female Atlas moth, for example, can reach up to 12 inches (30cm) with a surface area of 62 square inches (400 square cm). Mr Bevan said: 'The wing tips do really resemble that of a snake's head. 'It was extremely impressive to look at up close, and it looked the size of a bird when it flew.' When threatened, the insect drops to the ground and slowly fans its wings (pictured) in a movement that also looks similar to that of the snake's head. The rare insect is typically found in the forests of South East Asia . Known for its incredible size as well as its markings, the species has the largest wingspan of any moth in the world. The wingspan (pictured) of a female Atlas Moth can reach up to 12 inches (30cm) As well as their resemblance to a cobra's head, the moth gets its name because its wing patterns are said to resemble maps. Cobras are famous for the threatening 'hood' around their head (pictured) which it consists of flaps of skin attached to long ribs . Another theory states the moth was named after the Titan Atlas who was condemned by Greek god Zeus to hold the sky upon his shoulders. This relates to its large wingspan, and the idea that they are a burden on the insects. Female Atlas moths are much bigger than males and attract mates by secreting irresistible pheromones through the end of their abdomens. The males sniff these out with a long, feathery antennae. The moths lay their eggs underneath leaves. Bluish green caterpillars, covered in a white powder, then hatch a week or two later and start eating. Their favourite meals include the Jamaican cherry tree, lime and citrus fruits. The creepy crawlies then encase themselves in a silken cocoon. The pupal stage lasts for around a month. Male adults don't have a mouth and survive from fat reserves built up from their caterpillar stage. They quickly mate and die shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, Cobras are famous for the threatening 'hood' around their head. This hood is extended when they feel threatened or angry, and consists of flaps of skin attached to long ribs. They additionally hiss loudly to scare off potential predators.","Images of the Atlas moth were taken by wildlife photographer, Brian Bevan .

"By . Sami Mokbel for the Daily Mail . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Click here for fourth round ties in the Capital One Cup . Don't worry Andre Schurrle, you have scored in a World Cup semi-final. That memory should keep the Germany forward sane when he reflects on all the opportunities he wasted against Bolton last night. The more he tried, the more he looked to the heavens. The final shot count for Schurrle was 12, four times as many as Bolton managed during the entire 90 minutes. Thankfully for the 23-year-old, Kurt Zouma and Oscar were more accurate as the Blues booked a Capital One Cup last-16 trip to League Two Shrewsbury. It should have been a much smoother ride for the west London club, though. Kurt Zouma slammed home the first goal on his Chelsea debut against Bolton in Capital One Cup . Chelsea's French defender Zouma pounced to open the scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech 6; Azpilicueta 6.5, Zouma 7, Cahill 6.5, Luis 7; Mikel 6.5, Ake 7 (Matic 90); Salah 7 (Hazard 79), Oscar 7, Schurrle 6.5; Remy 6 (Drogba 73). Subs: Ivanovic, Matic, Schwarzer, Christensen, Baker. Manager: Mourinho 7 . Bolton (4-5-1): Lonergan 7.5; Herd 6, Mills 6.5, Dervite 6, Moxey 5, Feeney 5 (Spearing 68, 5), Danns 5 (Mason 82), Pratley 5, Kamara 5, Davies 5 (Lee 52); Beckford 5 . Subs: Clayton, McNaughton, Ream, Kenny. Booked: Pratley . Manager: Freedman 6 . Referee: Graham Scott (Oxfordshire) - 6 . ‘Andre’s performance reflected the mentality of the team,’ said Steve Holland, Chelsea’s assistant coach. ‘Not much more than two months ago he was playing in the World Cup final, tonight he was playing in the Capital One Cup. He showed a real committed performance — full of drive all night. He looked our most likely source throughout the game. He was an example of what was best about our performance. ‘A combination of some missed chances, a bit of bad luck and some very good goalkeeping meant that we were still at the limit right at the end of the game.’ Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho fielded an understrength side, giving goalkeeper Petr Cech his first appearance of the season. Mourinho also gave Loic Remy a full debut after his move from Queens Park Rangers, while there were starts for youngsters Nathan Ake and Kurt Zouma. Bolton manager Dougie Freedman also made five changes from the side that started their Championship defeat by Wolves on Saturday. Chelsea began as if they meant business, possibly prompted by Mourinho’s wardrobe choice — the Portuguese opting for a suit rather than the tracksuit he favoured during this tournament last season. Or perhaps it was the fact Freedman kept him waiting for the customary pre-match handshake. Whatever it was, Chelsea came flying out the blocks and could have been four up inside 17 minutes. Chelsea's Kurt Zouma, right, celebrates scoring the opening goal against Bolton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge . Bolton Wanderers' Matt Mills (centre hidden) equalised with a powerful header against Chelsea . 11 - Crystal Palace, Hull, Tottenham and West Brom . 9 - Brighton, Chelsea, Nottingham Forest . 6 - Newcastle . 5 - Bolton, Manchester City . 4 - Sheffield Wednesday . 3 - Burton Albion . Schurrle had enough chances to have scored a hat-trick before the game was a quarter of an hour old. He was denied twice inside the first five minutes; his free-kick tipped wide by Andy Lonergan before a header was cleared off the line by Matt Mills. Mills again denied Schurrle, this time with a well-timed challenge as the World Cup winner met Cesar Azpilicueta’s cross after 14 minutes. Then Remy fluffed a chance to break the deadlock with a poor header before Schurrle squandered another chance. He was getting closer, though, his 20-yard free-kick being tipped on to the bar by Lonergan. The goal finally arrived in the 25th minute, but from an unlikely source. Bolton defender Dorian Dervite blocked Gary Cahill’s header from Mohamed Salah’s corner only for the ball to drop to Zouma and the French centre back slammed home his first goal for the club. Relief swept through the crowd but seven minutes later Bolton snatched a shock equaliser. Liam Feeney’s deep free-kick looked more hopeful than accurate but Mills rose above Jon Obi Mikel to head home from 14 yards. The goal did not alter the flow of the game, however, as Chelsea — and Schurrle, looked to regain the lead. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech was beaten by Matt Mills' thumping header for Bolton in the first half . Bolton celebrate Mills' equaliser against Chelsea in Capital One Cup third round tie at Stamford Bridge . The German missed two more chances before Ake thumped a long-range drive well over the bar just before the break. Schurrle, inevitably, was involved in their first chance of the second half but Oscar’s header from the German’s free-kick was well saved by the over-worked Lonergan in the 51st minute. Five minutes later, Chelsea made the vital breakthrough as Oscar thumped a 25-yard drive past Lonergan after good work by Remy. As if to rub salt into Schurrle’s wounds, he then saw his 80th-minute drive from 15 yards tipped on to a post by Lonergan, who gratefully held on to the loose ball.

The company ran a series of banner adverts that would appear on children’s apps promoting its voice-changing service. Outrage: A tribunal blasted a mobile company for bringing children within one click of a premium-rate service that allows users to make their voices sound like Star Wars characters by running enticing adverts . By clicking on the advert the phone would ring the premium rate line at a cost of £1 a minute plus network rates. The person could then record a message which would be digitally altered so they could sound like an alien or Star Wars character. But unlike other similar services the call did not cut off once it reached a cap of £3. This led to up to 14 complaints from parents who said their children had activated the number. In one case the child was just three and in another a bill of £150 was charged. Watchdog PhonepayPlus fined Acetelecom £60,000 and ordered it to refund all complaints in full within 28 days of being asked. Acetelecom advertised its app and service on mobile phone apps and websites that were popular with young children. Phone regulator PhonepayPlus said it appeared on Baby Flashcards, Talking Ginger and Toddler Flashcards. The tribunal verdict said the voice-changing service was guilty of not fixing a cap on spending, not providing enough information on costs on its adverts and ‘treating consumers unfairly’. They said that children were likely to find the company’s adverts appealing as they featured ‘bright colours and cartoonlike characters’. One parent who complained said: ‘My daughter tapped it by accident which then immediately phoned the premium rate 090 number. Under fire: The French app company, Acetelecom, has been fined for running the brightly-coloured adverts . Misled: The regulator warned companies to impose barriers to ensure children are not misled on mobiles . ‘There was no secondary ‘are you sure you want to call this number’ fail safe which meant that she has run up a £15 charge on my bill. I think that it is ridiculous that this sort of ad is allowed on a children’s app. ‘The fact that this ad only needed to be tapped once before activating the phone call is ridiculous.’ Joanne Prowse, from PhonepayPlus, said: ‘By promoting its service in such a way as to mislead young children into clicking on a link which would automatically connect and charge them, and by failing to impose the required spend caps on a service which was clearly aimed at children, Acetelecom has treated children, and by extension their parents, unfairly. ‘Practices which mislead consumers, especially vulnerable consumers, and result in bill shock cause serious harm to those affected and to the wider reputation of the premium rate sector. PhonepayPlus will not tolerate them.’ The service has since been removed from publicly available banner ads but is instead available from app stores, where it must first be downloaded and credit must be purchased to use the service. Acetelecom did not respond to requests for comment last night.","French app company Acetelecom promoted voice-changing service to kids .

While Mickelson dressed his comment up as a joke, he probably sees it as having some potential for the Americans to exploit any cracks in the usually harmonious European ranks. He may also have been riled by recent remarks made about him by the sometimes disarmingly frank McIlory. Two weeks ago he described Mickelson and Tiger Woods as being on the 'closing holes' of their topline careers. Only on Wednesday morning he made fun of a wayward drive Mickelson struck at the 2004 Ryder Cup, which he joked nearly hit him.

"By . Nick Fagge In Charlottesville, Virginia for MailOnline . and Ashley Collman . Police on Tuesday obtained an arrest warrant against Jesse Matthew for the abduction of Hannah Graham . An 'aggressive' manhunt was continuing today for the man suspected of kidnapping UVA student Hannah Graham. Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person seen with the 18-year-old before she disappeared in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the early hours of September 13. An arrest warrant was issued on Tuesday for Matthew on a charge of felony abduction with intent to defile - which under Virginia law means intent to commit a sexual assault. It was revealed on Wednesday that Matthew also has a long list of previous charges against him - from assault and grand larceny to trespassing and being in possession of stolen property. Online court records showed that Matthew was convicted of trespassing in 2010 but provide no details about the incident. He also faces a slew of traffic violations, according to WSLS. In June 2009, Matthew allegedly assaulted someone during an attempted theft of a cell phone but the charges were later dropped. Matthew has hired a former prosecutor as an attorney, WUSA9 reported on Wednesday afternoon. James Camblos, a veteran attorney, told the station that he had spoken to Matthew but would not confirm if he knew his client's current location.

Miss Graham's disappearance has sent a ripple of fear through the quiet college town of Charlottesville. University president Teresa Sullivan said in a written statement on Tuesday that local and campus police have increased patrols, and the university has expanded the hours of a program that provides late-night van transportation for students. Students have said they've begun walking in pairs at night and are paying closer attention to their surroundings.

Witnesses later saw Matthew buying drinks for 18-year-old Hannah at the Tempo bar and the pair leaving together. Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar, MailOnline revealed. Chief Longo said Matthew was the last person to see the 18-year-old student before she ‘vanished off the face of the earth’. MailOnline exclusively revealed how the UVA nursing assistant told family members he was not responsible for the 18-year-old’s disappearance and that the pair ‘went their separate ways’. Matthew’s grandmother Christine Carr told MailOnline: ‘He told his mother he bought her some drinks. ‘He said she did not get into his car. He said he went his way and she went hers.’ ‘LJ would never hurt anybody,' Mrs Carr, 82, from Charlottesville, told MailOnline. 'I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life.' Matthew has been on the run since Saturday when police issued an arrest warrant for his arrest on two counts of reckless driving. Police released this footage in their search for a man in dreadlocks.

According to Charlottesville Police Chief Longo, Matthew walked into the police station with his mother and his uncle on Saturday but quickly left the station after asking to speak to a lawyer. Police say he sped away afterward, losing officers who had him under surveillance and prompting authorities to issue two arrest warrants for reckless driving. Hannah's parents, John and Sue Graham, made an emotional appeal for their teenage daughter's safe return on Sunday during a press conference. Mr Graham said: ‘As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah’s big brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like to make this statement. ‘Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James’s little sister. She is also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously precious to us.' According to police, Graham met friends at a restaurant for dinner on September 12 before stopping by two parties at off-campus housing units. The sophomore, from northern Virginia, left the second party alone, police have said, and sent a text message to a friend saying she was lost. Surveillance videos showed her walking, and at some points running, past a pub and a service station and then onto the Downtown Mall, a seven-block pedestrian strip lined with shops and restaurants where police believe she entered a bar with Matthew. According to family members and police, Graham is an alpine skier and plays the alto saxophone. Organizers of a candlelight vigil last week at the university handed out her favorite candy, Starburst. Police Chief Longo said he learned from visiting with Graham's parents that the graduate of West Potomac High School earned straight A's six years in a row.

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said his government had taken the 'most sensible action' in abandoning plans to restrict women's rights to have an abortion . Spain's government today abandoned plans to restrict women's right to abortion, which had sparked mass protests and international condemnation. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said his government would drop the most contentious parts of the proposed reform, which would have ended women's right to freely opt for abortion up to 14 weeks into a pregnancy. He said: 'We will continue studying ways to obtain greater acceptance of the reform, but I think I have taken the most sensible decision at this time. Mr Rajoy added: 'We cannot have a law that will be changed in a minute as soon as another government comes along.' He said his government would push on with a family-planning reform, but it would focus on only two areas: requiring girls aged under 18 to get their parents' consent to have an abortion and other 'family support' measures. The most controversial elements proposed by Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, which sparked street demonstrations by both opponents and supporters, will be dropped. A draft bill approved in December aimed to allow abortion only in cases of rape reported to the police or a medically certified threat to the mother's physical or psychological health. Under the bill women wouldn't be able to abort a pregnancy on the grounds of foetal abnormality. The previous Socialist government brought Spain into line with much of Europe when it passed the current law in 2010. Existing regulation allows women to choose to terminate a pregnancy in the first 14 weeks, extended up to 22 weeks if the foetus is seriously deformed or if the birth poses a serious risk to the mother. International human rights group Amnesty International said Mr Ruiz-Gallardon's planned reform would have endangered the lives of women and girls by driving them into backstreet abortions. France's Social Affairs Minister Marisol Touraine in January said it would 'take women back to the Stone Age'. Mr Ruiz-Gallardon said lawmakers had to balance the mother's rights with the unborn child's, but he failed to gain enough support to bring his bill to parliament. A protest in March against the  reforms which critics said would have sent women 'back to the dark ages' One high-profile dissenting figure in the ruling Popular Party was Extremadura region president Jose Antonio Monago. He led a bill in the regional parliament calling for a reform that is 'more consensual and in tune with today's society and in line with the countries around us'. After promising in its 2011 election campaign to 'reinforce protection of the right to life', Mr Rajoy's government repeatedly postponed the reform as it struggled with internal dissent and pressure from the Roman Catholic Church. In April 2013, the then head of Spain's Catholic Church, Cardinal Antonio Maria Rouco Varela, called for an 'urgent reform' of the 2010 law. Critics said Mr Rajoy made the decision with one eye on next year's local and regional elections. A leading anti-abortion group, Right to Life, branded Mr Ruiz-Gallardon a 'coward' for not standing up to political opponents and urged Spaniards not to vote for Mr Rajoy. The group's spokeswoman, Gador Joya said: 'He has shown that he is capable of betraying his base, the 11 million voters who trusted in him.' But abortion rights campaign group Decidir welcomed the news, with spokeswoman Isabel Serrano saying: 'We are back to a place we should never have left: the European standard, where a woman's decision is respected and abortions are carried out in conditions of safety and equality for all.'","Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he had taken 'the most sensible action'

Former mining magnate and racing figure Nathan Tinkler has became a father for the fifth time with his former executive assistant, 'pretty blonde' Jodie Van Gilst, Sydney Morning Herald reports. Ms Van Gilst recently gave birth and is reportedly living at Tinkler's Singapore luxury suite in the Marina Collection development. Tinkler's former spokesman, who says the 38-year-old currently doesn't have a manager, told Daily Mail Australia the new baby was born about two weeks ago. The spokesman, who no longer represents Tinkler, was unable to provide further details. Tinkler's estranged wife, Rebecca, resides in Hawaii with the couple's four children since last year, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. They are living in their $16 million mansion in the 'exclusively gated community' of Keauhou on the island of Maui.

Ms Van Gilst, from Queensland, had enjoyed reoccurring trips to the exclusive Birdcage marquees at the Melbourne Cup. In 2012, Ms Van Gilst was spotted at the Melbourne Grand Prix with her now baby's father but Tinkler's spokesman shut down the reports, stating they were there 'purely on business.'

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A boy and girl aged 13 and another 15-year-old girl have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a man who was found 'badly beaten' in his home. Detectives today named the 42-year-old man  as Warren Free as they stepped up their inquiry into the death. Mr Free  was unconscious when emergency crews arrived at his house in Spalding, Lincolnshire, on Thursday, after a suspected break-in. Emergency services were sent to Coronation Close in Spalding, Lincolnshire, after the 42-year-old man was found unconscious. Three children under the age of 15 have now been arrested for murder . He was airlifted to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, but died in the early hours of Friday morning. A neighbour suggested that Warren's son was at home when he was attacked. Gena Probert, 85, who lived next door, said: 'It is a terrible thing to happen. I only knew him as Warren and he was a sweet man and wouldn't hurt a fly. 'I was woken up by the sound of someone running down the street at about 1am in the morning but didn't think too much of it until I saw police and ambulance at Warren's house the next day. 'I saw him being dragged out on a stretcher with a blanket over him, he was absolutely covered in blood. I couldn't even make out his face, he was that badly beaten. 'The air ambulance came down in the skate park but there were delays in it taking off because the paramedics couldn't get him stable. 'The police came to see me and said a girl and a boy aged 13 were suspected of breaking into his house and another 15-year-old was also arrested.' 'He used to . come round and have a coffee or a can of coke and sit and chat to me. He . would often take my bins out of get me a pint of milk or paper from the . shop if I couldn't go out. 'I . feel awful about what has happened. This is a very close-knit community . and we look out for each other. I will miss Warren terribly.' The victim was airlifted to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham but died in the early hours of this morning . An elderly neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Warren had a 12-year-old son and a daughter that lives in Wales. She was about 20.' It is understood that his mother and father moved to Portugal a few months ago. 'He didn't work. What he told us a long time ago was that he was beaten badly in Wales and that's the reason why he moved here.' Another neighbour added: 'He kept himself to himself. I spoke to him but that's about all. 'He used to walk past with his son. I spoke to him one time where he said he came from Reading, moved to Wales, and then came here. He was a friendly chap. 'The police asked us to look after the son (on Thursday) while they tried to find him somewhere to stay. 'He stopped here with us for a couple of hours. He must be 12 or 13. 'Warren's parents live in Portugal but I saw them when they came to visit Warren.'

Inspector Jim Tyner, community policing inspector for Spalding, said: 'Coronation Close is a close-knit community and I know many will be affected by what has happened. 'My officers will be carrying out extra patrols in the area and I would urge residents to approach them with any concerns.' Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Martin Holvey, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, added last night: 'We are continuing to investigate the circumstances in which Mr Free sustained the injuries that led to his subsequent death and I am appealing to anyone with information that may assist the enquiry to contact the major incident room by calling 101 and quoting incident 161 of 28th August.'

"By . Kit Holden . Toni Kroos is set to pack his things and head to Old Trafford, but one thing should remain clear: Louis van Gaal did not make the midfielder the player he is today. While Kroos no doubt established himself as a prominent Bayern player under Van Gaal, the Dutchman’s influence was nothing compared to that of the man who coached Kroos before and after him: Jupp Heynckes. It was under Heynckes that he first played regular Bundesliga football. It was under Heynckes that he finally became a crucial figure for Bayern and the national team. Manchester United-bound: Toni Kroos (right) holds off United's Danny Welbeck in the Champions League . Kroos joined Bayern as a 16-year-old . from East German club Hansa Rostock in 2006. By Christmas 2008, he was . still yet to prove himself as a first-team player, and then Bayern coach . Jurgen Klinsmann let him out on loan to Bayer Leverkusen. There, he had his first taste of working under Jupp Heynckes. Despite injuries hindering him in the early months, Kroos soon began to shine at Leverkusen. Under Heynckes, he could fulfil the two roles for which he is now famous: the space-creating No 10 with the vicious shot, and the game controlling No 6 with an astute tactical awareness. Upon his return to Bayern in the summer of 2010, Kroos did thrive under Van Gaal, and impressed hugely before Christmas, at a time when Bayern had an injury crisis in attacking midfield. By the time Van Gaal left Bayern in the usual storm of tears and internal politics, Kroos was a well-established figure at the Allianz, though questions remained over his role in the team. Then, Heynckes turned up again, this time as Bayern coach. Kroos greeted his arrival by saying: 'He is the coach in professional football who has always given me his constant trust and support. It’s a stroke of luck for me that he’s coming'. Champion: Kroos (second right) celebrates winning the Bundesliga title by lifting the shield with team-mates . The boss: Louis van Gaal (centre) - taking Holland training - was Kroos' manager when he was at Bayern . It was in . the following two seasons, from 2011 to 2013, that Kroos really became a . force. It was in those seasons where he became recognisable across . Europe, both on club and international level. With . fame and responsibility, of course, comes sharper criticism. Though few . doubt his talent, many have accused Kroos of being a lazy player in the . last few years. That is an impression shaped largely by memories of his poor performance against Andrea Pirlo at Euro 2012. Kroos’ sluggishness on that day has haunted him since but in truth he rarely tears around. He may not sprint around the place like Usain Bolt but his positioning and his ability to create space are beyond doubt. Those are skills which Henyckes brought out of him. Top talent: Kroos (left) celebrates winning the German Cup with Arjen Robben (centre) and Philipp Lahm . The teacher: Jupp Heynckes is the manager who brought out the best in Kroos' game at Leverkusen and Bayern . Of all the players of the Van Gaal era linked with United so far, it's no surprise that . Kroos has secured a move to Manchester United. Thomas Muller may have a . stronger relationship with the new United coach, but he, like Bastian . Schweinsteiger, is also Bayern Munich through and through. The two . players eat, drink and sleep Bayern. Kroos, on the other hand, is an East German, a one-time Werder Bremen fan, and a pragmatist. He has worked under Van Gaal successfully before, and knows he can fit into the Dutchman’s system. But the move will be about money, and Kroos wanting a new experience. Not sentimentality for the man who brought him stardom. The man who did that is not manager of Man United. He’s enjoying a well earned semi-retirement.","Toni Kroos has agreed £20million summer move from Bayern Munich to Manchester United .

"By . Michael Theodoulou . Danny Brewster, 27, is accused of failing to deliver £70,000 worth of bitcoins . The British boss of a company selling the virtual currency Bitcoins is now wanted by Cyprus police on suspicion of fraud. Danny Brewster, 27, is accused of failing to deliver £70,000 worth of bitcoins, a currency created on a computer but increasingly used in real world transactions. The Bentley-owning Briton also allegedly racked up debts of about a million euros on the recession-hit island, a local financial newspaper reported. These stem from ‘a major marketing campaign, employing nearly 20 staff and developers, renting office space and buying furniture,’ the Financial Mirror said on its website on Saturday. Brewster is claimed to have lavished an estimated half-a-million euros alone on a huge advertising blitz for the recent launch of his company, Neo & Bee. His baffled and angry employees, most if not all of them now out of work, were not paid in March. A police official said today investigations are on-going and did not rule out issuing a European arrest warrant for the Briton, who is understood to come from the Sheffield area. ‘He was spending money like crazy,’ one of his worried creditors told The Daily Mail. Brewster, who said he had a banking background, struck him as very ‘gentlemanly, cordial and very willing to listen and learn’. But, less than a month after the grand opening of his Bitcoin store in a swanky Nicosia office block on February 24, Brewster is alleged to have abruptly disappeared abroad. His whereabouts remain a mystery. His last communication with his staff was on March 19 when he told an employee he had gone abroad to raise capital, sources said. Brewster publicly broke his long silence for the first and last time on April 2 when he vehemently denied any wrongdoing. He said he originally left Cyprus on a ‘short-term temporary basis’ to raise additional capital ‘for the business through the sale of my equity as we had run out of liquidity’. But, he added in a posting on an online bitcoin talk forum, he then received ‘threats’ targeting his young daughter, which he had reported to the ‘relevant authorities’. At this point the Neo & Beo CEO said he decided to sell of his equity in the company and remain abroad, it is claimed. A woman walks past the offices of Neo & Bee in Nicosia, Cyprus. Cyprus based bitcoin vendor Neo & Bee is under investigation by police after allegations it committed fraud against at least two of their customers . Denying claims of embezzlement, he insisted that ‘every single bitcoin raised and spent is accounted for’. Police, however, said Brewster never informed them of the alleged threats against his young daughter. He no longer lives with her mother but it is unclear whether he is divorced or never married. The Financial Mirror said it ‘is not known whether Brewster has access to the nearly three mln euros worth of bitcoins that LMB [Holdings] maintains’, referring to Neo & Bee’s UK-based parent company.It added Brewster threw a ‘smokescreen a few weeks ago by agreeing to pay some 35,000 euros in duties to import his Bentley’. Another source told the Mail he also paid an entire year’s rent in February on a big house in an upmarket Nicosia suburb.Neo & Bee halted operations in late March before its software to carry out transactions had even gone live. But trading of its shares on the private Havelock Investments exchange has continued after a brief suspension earlier this month. Their value has plunged along with the company’s market capitalisation. Both the Cyprus Central Bank and the finance ministry issued warnings to customers after Neo & Bee’s lavish advertising campaign last month, saying the bitcoin was an unregulated virtual currency and therefore inherently unsafe. But, according to Brewster’s sales pitch, it was traditional banks that people could no longer trust following the precedent of Cyprus’s painful ‘bail-in’ last year. ‘He kept telling us his idea was to build something that would either be taken over by some international big investor and make this into a regional or worldwide brand,’ the creditor said. The tagline for Brewster’s promotional campaign was ‘Who is Neo?’ More pertinently, the Cyprus Mail’s front-page headline on Saturday asked: ‘Where is Neo?’","Danny Brewster, 27, is accused of failing to deliver £70,000 worth of bitcoins .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man has died after being knocked to the ground with a single punch by a stranger in a New York City square. Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, had been left brain damaged after being punched in Union Square last week in an apparent racist attack. Mr Babbitt died after allegedly being hit by Lashawn Marten, a 31-year-old African American, who reportedly said that he wanted to attack the next white person who walked by. The 62-year-old, the sole carer of his 92-year-old mother Hedda, was hit so hard that he fell to the ground but later managed to stand. His condition deteriorated soon afterwards and he died at Bellevue Hospital. Scroll down for video . Killed by a single punch: Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, has died at a New York City hospital after being left brain dead when he was punched by a stranger in an alleged racist hate crime . Charged: Lashawn Marten, 31, in custody in a police cruiser He allegedly stood up from a chess table in Union Square Park, said 'I'm going to knock out the next white person who walks by' and assaulted Jeffrey Babbitt . His mother Mrs Babbitt, who the retired train . conductor shared a Brooklyn apartment with, had been at his hospital's . bedside since Wednesday. Two other white men, aged 48 and 18, . suffered minor injuries after allegedly being attacked by Marten as they . tried to help Mr Babbitt who was lying on the ground. Footage of the aftermath of the assault shows the victim on the ground, with blood pouring from his head. Tragic: Mr Babbitt, who was the sole carer for his 92-year-old mother, died in hospital . Marten, who has a previous criminal record and uses various aliases, was charged with assault and is due in a Manhattan court on Tuesday. It is likely his charges will now be upgraded.

She added: 'His fist went in . and the man’s head bobbed and he hit the ground and you could hear his . skull hitting the ground.' Michael Benson, who also saw that attack, told ABC Local: 'The . guy got agitated for some reason or another and he said, ""The . next white person that bumps into me without saying excuse me, I'm going . to knock him out"".' After his racist rant and attack, witnesses said Marten stayed at the park and waited for police to arrive. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said . Marten's alleged comments about targeting white people before allegedly . punching Mr Babbitt could lead to hate crime charges being made against . him. 'Our Hate Crimes Task Force is involved in aspects of that case,' he added. Marten is being held on a $1 million bond as police decide whether to also charge him with a hate crime.

"By . Sarah Dean . He'd already scooped a prize catch and then he got a real surprise. Opening the mouth of a glistening jungle perch to pull out his lure, angler Angus James discovered a bright green tree frog inside the fish's mouth. And the Australian amphibian looked more than happy just where he was - with what looked like a smug smile on his face. Croaky throat: Angler Angus James found a green tree frog inside the mouth of a jungle perch while fishing at the weekend in Townsville, Queensland . 'I was shocked. I thought it might have been green grass at first, then it blinked,' the professional field fisherman told News Limited. Mr James caught the fish - together with the frog - in waters about an hour's north of Townsville, far north Queensland. But once the exotic amphibian had been disturbed he made his great escape - jumping straight over Mr James' head. Of course, that was not before Mr James had manged to take a swift picture of the incredible occurrence. The fishing enthusiast said: 'I always carry a camera so I took the pic and then he jumped out.' What a catch: The professional fisherman got more than he bargained for when he caught this jungle perch . The green tree fog is a species native to Australia and New Guinea, with introduced populations in New Zealand and the United States. Larger than most Australian frogs, it can reach 4 inches in length. There's no telling how long it had been nestled inside the jungle perch's mouth but the average lifespan of the frog in captivity is about 16 years. It is known to scream when it is in danger to scare off its foe, and squeaks when it is touched, but Mr Angus reported no such noises so presumably the frog was not too frightened by being discovered in its unlikely home. After his special sighting at the weekend, Mr James sent the photo to Reptiles magazine, which posted it on Facebook, earning 40,000 likes and 2000 comments. One impressed angler commented: 'He [the frog] looks like he's smiling. I guess I would be too if I were him.'","Angler Angus James found a green tree frog inside a jungle perch's mouth .

"By . Sarah Harris . Up to 13 children are competing for entry to the country’s best state schools amid a desperate scramble for places today. Tens of thousands face missing out on their preferred secondary schools amid mounting competition on National Offer Day. Competition is particularly fierce in areas of the country including Kent and Buckinghamshire where some parents are already planning appeals after their children failed to get into grammar schools. As many as one in six 11-year-olds - 74,000 - are set to be rejected from their first choice secondary when places are allocated across England. At the West London Free School (pictured), founded by journalist, Toby Young, there were 1,178 applicants for 120 places - almost ten applicants per place . And about 20,000 are likely to be forced to accept places at comprehensives that their parents did not mention among their top three choices on application forms. Some 500,000 children will discover their secondary school places today with primary allocations announced in April. Experts say that competition this year has also been fuelled by rising numbers of parents being forced to leave the private sector and look for state schools instead. Families are also increasingly competing places at free schools and academies that are funded by the taxpayer but free from local government control. At the West London Free School, founded by journalist, Toby Young, there were 1,178 applicants for 120 places - almost ten applicants per place. The Greenwich Free School in London, which opened in September 2012, had 640 applications for 100 places. King Solomon Academy in Westminster - which is rated outstanding by Ofsted - has almost nine applications per place. Ark Academy in Wembley - also judged outstanding - has seven applicants per place. Sutton Grammar School for Boys, in Sutton, Surrey, launched a two-stage testing process this year in a bid to ‘reduce the anguish’ for parents when filling in their application forms. Sutton Grammar School for Boys (pictured), in Surrey, launched a two-stage testing process this year in a bid to 'reduce the anguish' for parents when filling in their application forms . Just over 1,600 children sat the first test on October 6 in a bid to land one of 120 places - a ratio of 13 applicants for one place. Just 588 were invited back for the second test in November, with one in five competing for places. The remainder knew not to place the grammar school on their application form which had to be submitted by October 31. Matt Richards, senior director of Schoolappeals.com which helps parents challenge admissions decisions, has already been contacted by around 50 families from across the country as they anticipate being disappointed today. He said there is a ‘lot of pressure’ on the grammar sector, with more than a dozen parents already planning appeals after their children failed the 11 plus exam. He added: ‘We’ve also noticed a steady flow of people coming out of private and going into the state sector.’ Mr Richards said the picture was ‘patchy’ across the country. He added: ‘If you’re in some parts of London or across the South East, there are a lot of worried people.’ One father-of-three, who was forced to withdraw his 14-year-old daughter from private school after losing his media job, has battled to get her into a good state school. The 44-year-old from North London said: ‘The best state schools are extremely difficult to get into. 'The appeal route is now a more used option because of the difficulty involved.’ Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, added: ‘Schools differ widely and canny parents are eager to get their children into the best schools because they know the difference it makes. ‘You will get a lot of competition for some schools and other schools will have places that children end up in - they’re not popular but that’s where they go if they haven’t been able to get into their top choices.’ Last year, children in the North East had the highest chance of gaining a place at their chosen school - 95.1 per cent in the region gained their first choice. But pupils in London had the largest risk of losing out, with just two-thirds (67.5 per cent) being offered a place at their first preference. In Wandsworth, South West London, 46.5 per cent of children did not get their first preference and 16 per cent failed to get any of their top three choices. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘All parents should be able to send their child to a good local school. ‘Our school reforms will drive up standards and create more good schools.’","Fierce competition at secondary schools on National Offer Day .

She says: ‘Over the decades I have spent thousands on twice-yearly visits to the dentist. ‘Because I have a small jaw, my teeth are overcrowded, causing constant infections. ‘I also had wisdom teeth problems, and two front teeth that came through the same socket. ‘During one visit seven years ago, I had nine teeth removed at once and four bridges, or fake teeth,  fitted in their place. 'It was a nightmare. I learned to  deal with it by grinning, rather than smiling, but the state of my teeth was always on my mind. ‘In 2008, my marriage broke down irreversibly. 'It was shattering. 'For a  long time I was tearful, before I realised that, as a single woman, I had to take control of myself. ‘In addition to sorting out my finances, and buying my very first car, I decided to sort out my teeth. 'I wanted to feel pretty and proud of myself again. ‘I saw an advert for  United Smile Centres in  the summer of 2012. 'I baulked at the £30,000  cost of implants, before remembering the thousands I’d spent at the dentist throughout my life, and took the money from my savings. ‘A consultation revealed that my teeth were in  such a bad state I’d have  to have all the remaining  ones taken out, but  thanks to the sedative I have no recollection of  the operation.

Before and after: The 68-year-old says that no one can believe that her false teeth are not her own . ‘Afterwards I was sore and lived on mashed vegetables for several weeks as my new teeth adjusted. On the bright side, I was delighted to discover I’d lost 9 lb! ‘My final set of teeth were fitted four months later.  I’m thrilled – nobody would ever guess they’re not my own. 'I brush them well and have them polished every six months. I’m still single but love life. 'Last September I even went for  a cruise around the South Pacific on my own, which I’d never have had the confidence to do before.

David Holmes, 38, was killed in June last year when a car turned into his path on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk, where the speed limit is 60mph. The devastating moment was captured on the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. Mr Holmes's last word, uttered seconds before impact, was 'whoa'. Now his mother Brenda, 62, has decided to release the footage in a bid to stop others going through the same agony of losing a family member. Scroll down for video . A mother has released harrowing footage showing the moment her motorcyclist son was killed in 97mph crash on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk . The devastating moment was captured by the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. The car is seen turning into his path as Mr Holmes drives along the road . The last word that he utters seconds before the impact - 'whoa' - can be heard on camera . The retired nurse wants both motorcyclists and drivers to be more aware of each other on the roads, to stop more crashes like this taking place. She said that the driver - who has since admitted causing death by careless driving - did not see the motorcyclist, but that Mr Holmes, who was driving nearly 40mph over the speed limit, also did not have time to take 'evasive action'. She said: 'I want to be involved in this campaign because I feel something positive can come out of his loss. 'If we can prevent one accident; one family going through what we have been through then David would not have died in vain. It is not easy to do but I hope somebody benefits from seeing it.' Mr Holmes was travelling back from King's Lynn, Norfolk, where he had been with colleagues. He overtook several cars on his powerful bike in the minutes leading up to the fatal crash. He was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene. The car then drives into Mr Holmes's path, killing him instantly on impact . Mr Holmes was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene . Speaking about the crash, his mother said: 'I know he rode fast that day. He loved speed and motorbikes. 'The driver did not see him and turned right across his path. David did not have time to take evasive action.' In the video, Mrs Holmes tells how her son, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey and had recently returned from The Antarctic, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday. She said: 'We brought it back home in the back of his Dad's truck, He was jumping up and down with excitement. It was fabulous. A lovely, lovely memory. Mr Holmes, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday . His mother Brenda, 62, has agreed for the footage to be released as part of a police road safety campaign . 'Although his father said he wishes he had never bought him that first bike, I would not have deprived David his 22 years of riding.' She said he was 'the most wonderful son' and was described by his friends as a 'gentleman and a legend'. Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, head of the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said he was 'confident' that the clip would save a life. In just three days, the video, recorded on the motocyclist's camera, has been watched by almost 4.5million people. He said: 'David's family have always been of the belief that if this video could save just one life then it would be worth it. 'Unfortunately, we'll never know if we have achieved this but I'm confident, with the level of interest that we will.' Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pictured, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving . In April this year, Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. He was subsequently ordered to perform 130 hours of unpaid work. His driving licence was also suspended for 18 months. The court heard Austin admitted he had not seen Mr Holmes before making the turn. In passing sentence, Judge Veits said no one had suggested Austin had been driving dangerously, but he had made a mistake that 'sadly' too many other drivers also make, of 'simply' not seeing the motorcycle. Headded: 'Nothing I can impose can turn the clock back and undo the tragic consequences of the accident that sadly took away the life of Mr Holmes. I only hope the family of Mr Holmes can now move on as this case is concluded and attempt to rebuild their lives.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

The prescription-only medications can cause blood clots, deep vein thrombosis and strokes. Women may also develop ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome, that can cause fatal organ failure, and life-threatening cysts, as Lorraine Davy did in a case study. Scroll down for video . After buying potentially deadly fertility drugs   online, women may develop ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome, that can cause fatal organ failure, and life-threatening cysts, as Lorraine Davy (pictured) did . Women unable to afford private treatment are buying the egg production-boosting drugs online after being refused NHS funding, doctors say. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has revealed that IVF medication is being sold for a third of the normal market price on eBay. The fertility drugs include brand names Suprecur, Cetrotide and Menopur. They are hormone treatments used to stimulate the ovary to produce more eggs to increase fertility and as part of IVF procedures. Last night doctors called for women to be warned of the dangers of buying such drugs over the internet. Leading fertility expert Professor Lord Winston cautioned: ‘You don’t know if they are what they say on the packet. The drugs may not be pure and there’s always a risk when drugs are taken without medical supervision.’ Dr Geetha Venkat, a consultant at the private Harley Street Fertility Clinic, added: ‘Women need to be warned against buying these medications online. These are hormone injections and unless they are medically supervised they can be dangerous to life.’ Women unable to afford private treatment are buying the egg production-boosting drugs online after being refused NHS funding, doctors say (stock image) The investigation found that 1mg of Suprecur (pictured), which normally costs £35 at a private clinic, can be bought for as little as £15 on eBay (stock image) But Dr Venkat said despite the dangers women were tempted to buy IVF drugs online because they are rejected for NHS funding and cannot afford the high costs of paying privately. But Dr Venkat said despite the dangers women were tempted to buy IVF drugs online because they are rejected for NHS funding and cannot afford the high costs of paying privately. She said: ‘Fertility treatment is quite expensive and it’s not available in many areas, even though NICE guidelines say that couples should be eligible for three cycles of IVF. It’s like a postcode lottery. ‘So the women buying the drugs on eBay are probably trying to cut the cost of paying privately.’ The MoS found that 1mg of Suprecur, which normally costs £35 at a private clinic, can be bought for as little as £15 on eBay. Meanwhile, a packet containing ten vials of Menopur to inject, costing £300 when purchased privately, is on sale for £100. It is suspected the sellers could be either unscrupulous pharmacists, criminals selling counterfeit goods or couples who have gone through IVF and have left over medication. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed yesterday that it is illegal for IVF drugs to be sold anywhere other than at a registered pharmacy or under the supervision of a pharmacist. An MHRA spokesman said: ‘This is unacceptable and we’ve asked eBay to remove these medicines from sale as a matter of priority.’ An eBay spokesman said: ‘Our policies prohibit the listing of prescription drugs. Ebay works closely with the MHRA and other regulators who have a direct line to eBay to enable us to remove any listings of concern as soon as they are reported.’ Lorraine Davy was desperate to become a mother after suffering three miscarriages in six years. Ms Davy said doctors refused her NHS-funded IVF treatment because of her bipolar disorder. Unable to afford to go private, she bought the drug Clomid – which boosts egg production – on the internet. Lorraine, 26, recalled: ‘I really wanted a child and I was at my wits’ end. The price was just under £30 – so it was quite cheap. The next thing was that I got a month’s worth of tablets through the post.’ Lorraine, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, said: ‘I started taking them and within a week I began getting pains in my stomach. ‘I got rushed into A&E and they did an ultrasound and the doctor said I had a massive cyst on my ovaries as big as a newborn baby’s head.’ The cyst almost cost Lorraine her life. ‘The doctor said it was touch and go because of the size of it. I told him I’d taken Clomid and he said that was the cause of the cyst.’","Women unable to afford private treatment are buying IVF drugs online .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A Texas man repeatedly groped a female passenger on a New York City-bound flight while she tried to sleep next to him, federal authorities charge. Pratik Rakesh Doshi, a self-employed medical technician, was charged in Brooklyn Federal Court with abusive sexual contact stemming from the incident aboard an American Airlines flight, court records show. The victim said she had been sleeping on her tray table, flying somewhere between Dallas and New York City's Kennedy Airport, when she was roused by a repeated bumping and brushing against her torso and left leg. She at first thought the man next to her, later identified as Doshi, had bumped into her by mistake, so she pretended to still be asleep. She had taken a Valium hours earlier but told authorities she was no longer groggy. But then the touching became even more brazen: Doshi 'slid his hand under the passenger's shirt' and 'began rubbing and squeezing her left breast,' court records show. Pratik Doshi, of Texas, is charged with abusive sexual contact for allegedly groping a female passenger aboard an American Airlines flight . 'Let's go to the bathroom,' he whispered, according to the files. The woman, whose daughter was sitting next to her, continued to pretend she was asleep. He tried to spread the woman's legs apart using his feet and 'attempted to put his hand inside the passenger's pants,' court records show. Doshi, who had moved from a seat several rows back to sit next to the victim, 'began to rub his hand between the passenger's legs on the outside of her pants,' the files show. Fed up, the woman woke her daughter up and told a flight attendant. The victim and her daughter were moved to a different seat toward the back of the plane and remained there for the duration of the flight. When questioned after the flight, Doshi told authorities that he only had 'casual contact' with the woman, nothing beyond 'what would be typical for two people seated next to each other on an airplane,' court records show. He was arrested in Los Angeles on July 30 after he returned from a flight to India. His case file was unsealed this week in Brooklyn Federal Court, where he posted $40,000 bail.","Pratik Doshi, a Texas medical technician, has been slapped with federal charges of abusive sexual contact .

"It is an almost identical recreation . of famous 1932 image of . workers perched on steel beam above Manhattan . By . Anthony Bond . It is one of the most iconic photographs to have ever been taken. Sitting 800 feet above the crowded Manhattan streets, a weary group of steel workers enjoy their lunch perched on a beam. But now, more than 80 years on, a new group of workers have decided to recreate that stunning image. This hardy group of workmen from Alton . Towers decided to celebrate the completion of new £18million white-knuckle ride The . Smiler by enjoying their lunch on top of the ride. Back in time: Workmen from Alton Towers celebrated the completion of new white-knuckle ride The Smiler. They created a modern-day version of the famous 1932 image in which steel workers enjoyed their lunch perched on a beam . Famous: These steel workers helped to recreate one of the most iconic photographs ever taken when they sat on a beam 800-feet up on the RCA building in Rockefeller Center. The workmen at Alton Towers have recreated this image . It is an almost identical recreation of the famous image taken on September 20, 1932, when a group of steel workers enjoyed their lunch on the 70-story RCA building on New York's Rockefeller Centre. At the time, it was the largest building in terms of office space in the world. The new roller coaster at the popular theme park promises to terrorise thrill-seekers in a whole new . way after it was designed with the help of psychology experts and . scientific researchers. With plunging drops of up to 98ft and maximum speeds of 53mph, Smiler is set to terrify those who use it. But it is the roller coaster's psychological effects that are set to . push thrill-seekers to their limits, and the designers promise to 'blur . the line between illusion and reality'. Katherine Duckworth, one of the team who came up with the concept for the new ride at Alton Towers, said: 'This ride will put not just your body but also your mind through its paces. Finished: The workmen are pictured at the top of the new white-knuckle ride which its designers claim will terrorise thrill-seekers in a whole new way . Exciting: Alton Towers' Smiler opens in May, with plunging drops of up to 98ft and maximum speeds of 53mph . 'We want people to get off the ride and not know what is real. 'There are five different mind effects, which are all designed to mess with your head. You shoot towards giant syringes, spinning hypnotic wheels, and flashing lights, among other things.' These props are more than just background scenery. Each is a psychological trigger, set to keep the passengers on edge by disorientating and misleading them. The ride blasts towards huge needles and what looks like a drive-through car wash but, of course, the threat they present is only in the mind. Researchers from New Scientist magazine were involved in Smiler's design. They found anticipation is a key factor in ensuring a thrill and that they worked best when presented as stories or narratives. As such, Smiler even comes with its own back-story - that it was created by the Ministry Of Joy, a secretive organisation that has been conducting top secret experiments on mankind for years.

"By . Mario Ledwith . Fears: World Health Organisation director Margaret Chan . Antibiotics will soon become so ineffective that  a sore throat or grazing  your knee could kill, the World Health Organisation has warned. The microbes that cause the most common infections are starting to resist the drugs, meaning conditions will become much harder to treat. This will make remedies more expensive, and some conditions could even become untreatable. WHO director general Margaret Chan said that the world was  fast approaching the ‘post-antibiotic era’. She said the chances of changing this were ‘dim’ and expressed  concerns that the production line of more resistant drugs was  ‘virtually dry’. ‘A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it,’ she said. ‘Things as common as strep throat or a child’s scratched knee could once again kill. ‘Some sophisticated interventions, like hip replacements, organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy and care of pre-term infants, would become far more difficult or even too dangerous to undertake.’ Dr Chan added: ‘Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise in Europe, and elsewhere in the world. Replacement treatments are more costly, more toxic, need much longer durations of treatment and may require treatment in intensive care units.’ At the launch of a WHO book on the subject in Copenhagen, Dr Chan told a group of infectious disease experts that the ineffective nature of many antibiotics was because of ‘misuse’. She said overuse of antibiotics had contributed to the resistance of diseases and set out a number of ways to ease the situation. The WHO boss told the meeting more care should be taken to ensure that prescriptions are only given out when absolutely necessary. And she added that antibiotics should not be used in food production. Developing countries are particularly susceptible to infections which are becoming resistant to antibiotics. Dr Chan said that the worsening situation is at risk of being ignored. She said: ‘One problem is that  the threat of antimicrobial resistance is competing for attention in a world beset by one global crisis after another. These days, doomsday scenarios are a dime a dozen.’ Overused: As well as being prescribed to treat illnesses, antibiotics are commonly used in food production . According to the World Health Organisation – the public health arm of the United Nations – several countries have already introduced measures to quell the overuse of antibiotics. The organisation is calling for such policies to be implemented globally. It said that the treatment of tuberculosis globally had already identified the limitations of certain antibiotics. Of the 12million cases recorded  in 2010, about 650,000 involved strands that were resistant to multiple drugs. The health body said that even with the highest standards of care and medication, only 50 per cent of sufferers survived. The European Union says it already ‘has its eyes wide open’ to the issue and has compiled a five-year action plan with 12 areas for improvement. Medical experts in developing countries such as Vietnam and Thailand have also introduced schemes to reduce the number of antibiotics being prescribed.","'A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it,' warns WHO chief ."

The disease is caused by a mistake on the genetic code in a gene called dystrophin which is found on the X chromosome. Although girls may carry the mistake, they have two X chromosomes, so the healthy one cancels out the faulty one. But boys have only one X chromosome so they are more likely to be affected. The effect is that children suffering from the disease cannot produce dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscle survival. As a result, every skeletal muscle in the body deteriorates. It is 100 per cent fatal and there is no cure. Most boys die in their early 20s from heart or respiratory failure. The Duchenne Children’s Trust is working to find a cure for the disease in 10 years. Mr Norman, who has had a pilot’s licence since he was 17, said he was not nervous about the flight because it was in perfect weather conditions. ‘It was a double responsibility for me because it was my grandchildren,’ he said. ‘I was more worried about whether they were going to enjoy it because although they have wanted to do it every year from the age of three, I’ve always said no. ‘What I’m most proud about on this occasion, when they asked again, I said “no” but they said “Hang on, grandad, there’s this friend of ours with this terrible disease and we want to raise awareness because no one knows about it”.’ ‘They gave me the whole story and I said “OK, on this occasion I’ll give in and we’ll do it once”. ‘That’s why I’m so proud of them - they really wanted to do it. I feel it is fantastic that nine-year-old girls feel they can help in this way.’ Emily Crossley, Eli’s mother and founder of the Duchenne Children’s Trust, said: ‘We are very honoured that Rose and Flame are wingwalking to break a world record to help raise awareness of our charity. ‘This is a disease that desperately needs a cure. For other young children to be moved to help our child and hundreds of thousands of boys like him is very humbling.’","Rose Powell and Flame Brewer took to the skies in Gloucestershire .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A heroin addict pregnant with her third child continued to smoke the class A drug up until the birth of her daughter, powerless to stop her 10-year habit. Kay Shaw smoked £200 of heroin a day at the height of her addiction. Such was the hold the drug had over her, the 32-year-old was unable to break free of its grasp when she became pregnant with Billie. Ashamed of her actions now she is clean, Ms Shaw said 'it's disgusting but it happens'. Her daughter was born four weeks premature, and was immediately taken into care by social services. Scroll down for video . Former heroin addict Kay Shaw, now 32, continued to smoke the class A drug while pregnant with her third child. She is pictured with her son Kenzie, two, who was born after she got clean . At the height of her addiction, Ms Shaw was smoking £200-worth of the class A drug each day . The mother-of-four gave birth to her daughter Billie in February 2006. She was four weeks premature and was immediately taken into care. While she is in contact with her older sons Kye, 16, and Louis, 15, Ms Shaw (pictured with partner Ryan) is hoping to be reuninted with her daughter . Drugs, including heroin, can pass through the placenta to reach an unborn baby. Heroin can slow down the baby's growth and have an effect on its brain development. It can also cause the baby to have breathing difficulties after birth. One of the most serious problems heroin causes for the baby is withdrawal symptoms after birth. If the baby develops these, it will need special care in hospital. As the baby gets older, he or she may be at increased risk of behavioural problems and intelligence could also be affected. Trying to give up heroin during pregnancy can be dangerous and result in miscarriage, premature birth or stillbirth. As a result, pregnant women who want to give up the drug need to be monitored on a drug treatment programme. Source: The BabyCentre . Now Ms Shaw, who has been clean for the last five years, wants to warn others about the dangers of the class A drug. She said: 'I cried every day when I was pregnant and taking drugs because I felt so guilty. 'I’m so ashamed of taking heroin during my pregnancy, but when you’re addicted to something it’s so hard. I think it’s disgusting but it happens.' 'Just because you’re pregnant you can’t stop just like that. 'I’m so angry that I put drugs before my baby but I hope that one day I can make up for my mistakes. 'I . want to show people that heroin is an evil drug that can wreck your . life, but it is possible to battle back from the brink - I’m living . proof of that. 'I was worried about the harm I was doing the baby but I wasn’t the first to do it and I won’t be the last. 'I’ve since had a baby boy, Kenzie, and I feel like I’ve been given a second chance.' The mother-of-four grew up in West Yorkshire with her mother, older brother and sister. The 32-year-old said having Kenzie, pictured with his mother and father Ryan Telford, feels like she has a second chance, adding she hopes to one day be reunited with her daughter Billie . She endured a tough childhood, leaving school at the age of 15 without any qualifications and pregnant with her first child. She . moved to Plumstead in London before giving birth to Kye, now 16, and a . year later gave birth to her second son Louis, now 15. But the stress of being a young mother took its toll. When she was 18, an older boyfriend pressured her into trying drugs. Within a year her addiction had spiralled out of control and when her sons where four and five, Ms Shaw no longer felt able to care for them. She said: 'I sent them to live with their godparents so they could have a better life. 'It was heartbreaking, but I know it was for the best.' But with her children gone, Ms Shaw's addiction escalated. She split up with her partner but became pregnant accidentally when she was 23, by a different boyfriend. Ms Shaw, pictured with baby Kenzie, said she was 27 when she decided she had to get clean and turn her life around . She said: 'I didn’t realise I was pregnant until I was six and a half months gone and I was terrified. 'I . was badly addicted to heroin and I knew I couldn’t be a proper mum but I . could never have an abortion. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. 'I managed to cut down from taking £200 worth a day to £30 worth a day. 'I went to see a drug worker straight away and was prescribed methadone but I still couldn’t quit. I felt so guilty. 'Just because you’re pregnant you can’t stop just like that. I don’t agree with taking it while pregnant - I think it’s disgusting but it happens.' In February 2006, Ms Shaw gave birth to a baby girl four weeks early after developing pneumonia. She said: 'When she was born I was overcome with emotion. I was happy but I was scared because I knew she wasn’t going to be able to stay with me. 'Luckily she wasn’t addicted to heroin when she was born and despite everything she was a healthy baby.' Billie was taken into care and for the next four years her mother continued taking drugs. But when she was 27, she decided to turn her life around. She said: 'I knew I couldn’t get any lower. If carried on I was going to be dead in a couple of months.' Ms Shaw left London and went to stay with her mother in West Yorkshire during the withdrawal period. She started on buprenorphine, a heroin-substitute program, and has been clean ever since. She said: 'It was hard and I was tempted at times but I wanted my life back.' The 32-year-old got her own flat and an office job with a taxi firm and after a short relationship she gave birth to Kenzie, now two, in May 2012. She has recently become engaged to her partner of two years, Ryan Telford, a warehouse worker, and is hoping to marry as soon as possible. She said: 'Addiction is totally a mental illness - maybe it’s self-inflicted but you don’t know people’s background and how they got on it. Ms Shaw, said: 'I'm so angry I put drugs before my baby. I hope that one day I can make up for my mistakes' 'I’ve known people to die from an overdose or end up dangerously ill, I’ve went against all of the odds.' Now the mother-of-four is focusing on being a full time mum to Kenzie at their home in Northumberland. She said: 'I’ve been given a second chance to be a mum again and Kenzie is my world. 'I stay in touch with Kye and Louis and I hope that one day I’ll be reunited with Billie. 'Having Kenzie makes me realize how much I’ve missed out on with my daughter.'","Kay Shaw, 32, was addicted to heroin for 10 years smoking £200-a-day .

"By . Sara Malm . A British family on holiday in France ‘could have died’ after thieves piped gas from a car exhaust into their camper van to knock them unconscious before robbing them. Linda Chadwick and five members of her family had stopped for the night near Bourges when robbers broke into the vehicle and stole a suitcase, mobile phones, jewellery and £1,900 in cash. The family, from Oakwood, Derby, woke up with severe headaches and sore throats to find their mobile home had been raided. Victims: Linda and Darren Chadwick, their son Jamie, Jani Horsley and Mandy and Steve Willows were knocked out by thieves who pumped exhaust fumes into their caravan while they camped in France . Mrs Chadwick, was with husband Darren, 40, son Jamie, 21, his girlfriend, Janie Horsley, 17, her brother, Stephen Willows, 50, and sister-in-law, Mandy Willows, 46, when the shocking incident took place. The family were on their way back from Spain and had parked up for the night at a service station on the A71, just after midnight. The summer heat had made the group restless and unable to sleep. Mrs Chadwick says the last thing she remembers is seeing the lights of a car at 4.40am before ‘zoning out’. ‘We all woke up at around about the same time, at 6am, with terrible headaches and really sore throats. We were all in shock. It was so awful. ‘My brother, who was on the bottom bunk, said “Where's the suitcase?” We realised we had been robbed.’ Attacked: The family were targeted by robbers as they had parked up for the night at a service station by a motorway in France . The robbers broke in to the camper van when the group were unconscious form the fumes and stole a suitcase, mobile phones, jewellery and £1,900 in cash . Entering: Darren Chadwick looks at the lock damaged by the thieves during the late-night break-in . They went to a nearby petrol station where the attendant called the police, and they were taken to a police station and on to the Centre Hospitalier De Saint Amand Montrond. Linda said: ‘We were all seen individually by doctors and nurses and put into rooms where we were given oxygen and our blood samples were taken. We were in there nearly all of the day. ‘The person taking the blood said it could have killed us. It was horrendous. They said it could also lead to memory loss, flashbacks.’ Linda said the family had been given a report from the hospital saying that they had been affected by carbon monoxide. She said doctors believed that was ‘more than likely’ from exhaust fumes. The family were taken back to the police station, where Linda said that police interviewed them individually and took their fingerprints. Their ordeal follows reports of the same thing happening to another British couple near Marseilles. Debbie Keeney and Bob John were  ten days into a month-long camper van trip when they were targeted on July 6. Mr and Mrs Chadwick and their family members all suffered carbon monoxide poisoning in the robbery . The couple said they felt ‘violated and shaken’ but made a full recovery. Local police suspect they were gassed after receiving reports of Eastern European gangs preying on holidaymakers in the same way. Linda said the police dealing with her incident, on Saturday, July 19, had told her how criminals used exhaust fumes to knock people out. She said: ‘We were told they wait for you to get into the camper van at night. ‘Then they run a tube from their exhaust underneath the van where there are vents and the fumes get through there.’ Common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a feeling of weakness. Affected families often believe they are victims of food poisoning. And neurological signs include confusion, disorientation, visual disturbance, syncope and seizures Linda said her family had still not fully recovered from the ordeal. She added: ‘My brother has been waking up in the night. ‘He thinks they could have done anything to him because he was close to the door.’ Bourges police have confirmed they are investigating but have not yet made any arrests.","Family suffered carbon monoxide poisoning as thieves raided van .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Two-year-old Louis Mathurin was diagnosed with a rare disfiguring condition while still in his mother, Nina's womb . Little Louis Mathurin smiles through every day, despite suffering an extremely rare condition which has left every bone in his body malformed. The two-year-old was born with bent bone dysplasia syndrome, a life-threatening skeletal illness, affecting his breathing, ability to eat and walk. His mother Nina said despite her son's disfigurement, she does not regret having him after doctors offered her an abortion on medical grounds. The 41-year-old, said: 'When I first saw him I noticed his head was severely misshapen. My first reaction was that he looked like an alien. 'I felt instant love. I didn’t care in the slightest what he looked like - I just wanted him to be well. I felt a powerful sense of protectiveness from the very first moment.' Ms Mathurin, a business account manager from Hayes in Middlesex, conceived Louis through IVF after an ectopic pregnancy in 1999 left her unable to conceive naturally. She said: 'I knew I wanted children so to be told I might not be able to was extremely upsetting. 'When I fell pregnant through IVF on my first try in 2011, I was over the moon.' But Ms Mathurin’s pregnancy was to be marked by fatigue, sickness and anxiety. She said: 'The sickness during pregnancy was so bad that I couldn’t eat. I felt sick all the time and I couldn’t sleep. It was awful. 'At the 20-week scan they found that his bones were a bit short. I was sent up to a foetal care unit, where they did more detailed tests. 'They saw that he had a narrow chest, which triggered alarm bells. There was a definite air of concern. 'For the first time they talked about the possibility of him not surviving birth. 'No one could give me definitive answers - what condition Louis had, whether he had a type of dwarfism, or whether he was just short.' By her 24th week of pregnancy, Ms Mathurin was suffering acute anxiety and doctors had made the decision to offer her a termination on account of her unborn son’s apparent disfigurement. Ms Mathurin said: 'They offered me a termination on medical grounds - but I didn’t really know on what basis I would be making the decision. Scroll down for video . Despite her son's condition, Ms Mathurin, said she never regrets having Louis, after doctors offered her an abortion on medical grounds . Write caption here . 'All sorts of questions went through my mind - what would I be giving up? What would I potentially be putting Louis through if I didn’t have a termination? 'After everything, I found myself decided on the fact that I couldn’t give up on him. 'The question for me was - is Louis going to suffer? Is he going to have a life of misery? 'If the answer was a definite ""yes"", I would have terminated. But I couldn’t terminate on the basis that he wouldn’t be perfect. Bent bone dysplasia syndrome is a lethal skeletal disorder. Sufferers have malformed skulls, underdeveloped pubic bone and collar bones. Children diagnosed with the condition often have low-set ears, widely spaced eyes and a small chin. The condition is associated with mutations in the FGFR2 gene. It is so rare, Ms Mathurin said she is only aware of one other case in Canada. 'I got a second opinion, and the most conclusive observation was that Louis was going to be short. That was enough for me to decide - I wasn’t going to have an abortion on that basis alone. 'I was fiercely protective over him even though he hadn’t arrived yet. I wanted to do everything I could.' Louis was born two months prematurely on November 18, 2011. The delivery room was filled with 15 medical staff as Ms Mathurin gave birth. She said: 'All I wanted to do was see my child. I heard a short cry when he came out, then silence, then another cry. 'A doctor explained Louis wasn’t breathing properly and needed to be taken away for urgent treatment. I felt numb - we didn’t know if he was going to make it. 'After two hours I was able to see him in the high-dependency ward. Louis looked very unusual. 'At a later scan they realised that his cranium had healed at the back but the top was open, leaving him with an odd-shaped head. Ms Mathurin said: 'When I first saw him I noticed his head was severely misshapen. I felt instant love. I didn't care in the slightest what he looked like - I just wanted him to be well' 'I instantly felt a powerful love for him. I knew it was my responsibility to make sure he was well.' Louis was to stay in hospital for seven months as doctors ascertained what condition he had. They eventually diagnosed bent bone dysplasia syndrome, a non-genetic, often fatal disorder of the skeleton which affects his whole body. In his early months he would have a series of life-saving operations, including the installation of a cranial shunt and feeding tube and two head expansions. 'I felt instant love. I felt a powerless sense of protectiveness from the very first moment' - Nina Mathurin . Ms Mathurin said: 'Every bone in Louis’ body is malformed. It affects everything - from his mobility to his breathing. 'I don’t know of any other child in the country who has it. I believe there’s another family in Canada but I don’t think the child has the cranial-facial problems Louis has.' Ms Mathurin attends appointments with Louis every three months for checks and is observant for any worrying changes. She said: 'I don’t know if Louis’ condition will damage his brain or is life-limiting, which is why it’s important that we enjoy every day together as much as we can. He’s been through so much in his life already. 'He’s the happiest child you can imagine. He’s very affectionate and sociable, and brings a lot of joy to my life. Louis, pictured shortly after he was born, had a series of life-saving operations in his first few months, having a shunt fitted in his brain to drain fluid, a feeding tube inserted and two head expansion operations . 'I don’t have any regrets about having him. Sometimes people don’t realise how different my life is now - going out without Louis takes a lot of planning. But I don’t regret having him for a moment. I knew I made the right decision not to have a termination.' Ms Mathurin now volunteers at Great Ormond Street Hospital to support and advise families with children facing disabilities or major surgery. She said: 'When expectant parents are facing tough choices, what they usually hear are people - friends and family - telling them that they shouldn’t burden themselves with disabled children. 'But that’s not the way to look at life. You could have a perfectly healthy child and, heaven forbid, there could be illness or an accident. 'Would I have been comfortable knowing that I got rid of Louis without giving him a chance? No. That’s how I know I made the right choice. 'I encouraged two parents to let their children have tracheostomies. They were terrified, but showed them Louis and how, despite his challenges, he’s fine. 'Having a community of people around you makes that kind of journey a bit easier. It’s easier to talk to parents about the challenges than nurses.'

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . General Sir Peter Wall, head of the Army, warned further savings would damage 'our chances of success on the battlefields' Britain's chances of winning future wars will be ‘seriously damaged’ by more crippling spending cuts, the country’s top soldier has warned. General Sir Peter Wall, the head of the Army, said further savings likely to be ordered by the Government could prove ‘quite dangerous, quite soon’. Under current plans, the size of the Army is being reduced from 102,000 three years ago to 82,000 – small enough for every soldier to fit inside Wembley Stadium. The latest raft of around 5,000 . redundancies will be confirmed on Tuesday, shrinking the number of . personnel to 90,000 – its lowest level since before the Napoleonic Wars . began 200 years ago. But the Ministry of Defence is expected to be ordered by the Treasury to make further cuts of at least £1billion. Last night General Wall raised concerns about demanding more savings of the Armed Forces. He . said: ‘Imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies . have really materialised properly in a balanced way would be very . disruptive. ‘We have got to . the point in certain areas where we can’t go any further without . seriously damaging our professional competence and our chances of . success on the battlefields of the future.’ He told Sky’s Jeff Randall that further cuts would leave the Army ‘close’ to dysfunctional. Former commanders have warned the . controversial cuts are too deep, leaving the Army perilously . overstretched and unable to take on all the major military commitments . demanded by ministers. Some 5,000 personnel each from the RAF and Navy have already been made redundant. General Sir Peter Wall said any further savings could prove 'quite dangerous, quite soon' (file picture) The Government wants to reshape the Army, replacing regular troops by doubling the number of part-time soldiers to 30,000.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said . the financial bombardment from Chancellor George Osborne would damage . our defence capability. He said: 'Simply trying to salami slice across all areas is likely to lead to the worst possible outcome.

Lieutenant General Nick Carter, the most senior British soldier in Afghanistan and the architect of the blueprint to shake up the Army by 2020, said the responsibility for any weakening of the UK’s defence should lie with the Treasury. He said: 'At the end of the day our politicians need to decide what they want the Army to do. 'If they determine that the Army is going to do less, it's reasonable for them to reduce it still further. 'We are bound as military people to point out the risks during the . course of this to our political masters and ultimately it's down to them . to look themselves in the mirror each morning and determine whether or . not those risks are manageable.'","General Sir Peter Wall said more cuts could be 'quite dangerous, quite soon'

While traditional male escort agencies have been around a while, Rent a Gent is a new offering with a twist; the men on its books are contractually obligated not to have sexual encounters with clients. Operating in 12 states from all corners of the U.S. and gaining fast popularity, the men on the Rent a Gent books are all deemed handsome, intelligent, and multi-talented, and you can hire them as companions for $200 an hour. To investigate the Rent a Gent concept, 32-year-old writer Melanie Berliet, based in New York, booked Anthony; an actor and fitness instructor, for a three hour liaison. 'He was, without a doubt, a true gentleman, and a naturally amiable, well-educated guy,' she tells MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Smile! Writer Melanie Berliet, 32, (left), booked Anthony, an actor and fitness instructor (right), for a three-hour $600 liaison. 'He was, without a doubt, a true gentleman, and a naturally amiable, well-educated guy' Anthony wasn't an easy choice. Rent a Gent boasts men with a staggering range of professional offerings; from ex pro-football players to professional poker players, international models to DJ's; even teachers, professors and an aerospace engineer. Company founder Sara Shikhman tells Miss Berliet that she has women hire men for almost every purpose; from home-improvements and babysitting to wedding plus-ones and piano lessons. In the end, however, given the price tag, Miss Berliet opts for Anthony and doubles the date up with a one-on-one fitness session at the gym. With a serious bout of 'anxiety-induced cottonmouth,' she met Anthony dressed in her workout gear at the New York Health & Raquet club. Stretch it out: To get the most bang for her buck, Miss Berliet opted for a personal training session (pictured) before she took Anthony off for cocktails at a nearby bar . In an account she penned for Thought Catalog, Miss Berliet wrote: 'I’m grateful that Anthony takes charge from the outset by guiding our conversation and instructing me where to go. 'He's done this before, I can tell, and he’s a natural conversationalist. Though I can’t seem to wipe the stupid girlish smile off my face, his presence puts me at ease.' And Anthony's high-caliber modus operandi comes as no surprise. Of the thousands of men to audition for a coveted spot on the Rent a Gent books, only one per cent make it through the stringent screening and interview process. Within minutes of her appointment, Miss Berliet finds herself shoulders-deep into a sweaty workout. 'Anthony is stretching me out on a mat, positioning my body with the authority of an expert, but also with the tenderness of a quasi-boyfriend,' she writes. 'In between exercises, we chat casually about our lives.' Natural flirt: 'Anthony positions my body with the authority of an expert, but also with the tenderness of a quasi-boyfriend,' she writes. 'In between exercises, we chat casually about our lives' To follow up the session - which Miss Berliet is reluctant to refer to as a 'date' - the pair enjoyed cocktails at a nearby bar. 'The predetermined boundaries kept whatever connection existed between us at bay' 'I was impressed,' she tells MailOnline, adding that attractive as Anthony was, it was easy not to fall too hard. 'There was an underlying flirtatious element to our interactions, but it would be a serious stretch to say that I developed any sort of a crush on the man,' she explains. 'The predetermined boundaries kept whatever connection existed between us at bay.' When she asked Anthony just how strict the Rent a Gent no-sex rules were, he remarked that because all men sign a contract vowing not to sleep with clients, it would be 'foolish,' to do so, since 'all the power lies with the woman' to report it to his boss.

'I feel liberated,' she writes. 'I don’t have to worry about whether he’ll text me within the next few hours, or whether he expects sex the next time I see him. Overall I feel in control, if a bit broke.' 'People spend the equivalent on a host of other mood enhancing services' And while the $200 per hour price tag may sound outrageous to some, Miss Berliet argues that it can actually be worth it, if you keep an open mind. 'People spend the equivalent on a host of other mood enhancing services; from therapy to impromptu shopping excursions and yoga classes,' she tells MailOnline. 'As long as you can keep your head on straight throughout and remember that the experience is not essentially romantic or designed to lead anywhere but the here and now, it's a healthy way to let loose and have a little fun.'","Rent a Gent's men include professors, pro football players, professional poker players, DJ's, international models and even an aerospace engineer .

"By . Emily Davies . A British couple robbed while holidaying in France believe the thieves knocked them unconscious by piping gas into their camper van. Debbie Keeney, 54, and Bob John, 68, were just ten days into a month-long trip when they were targeted after stopping at services. Police in Lancon de Provence, some 30 miles from Marseilles, believe the couple fell victim to an Eastern European gang, following a string of similar attacks on tourists. The couple lost around £200 cash, £300-worth of jewellery, passports and credit and debit cards in the attack, which left Miss Keeney feeling ‘violated’ and ‘shaken’. Debbie Keeney, 54, and her partner Bob John, 68, from Manston, Kent, were just ten days into their annual month-long trip to France when the terrifying raid took place . The couple woke at the service station where they had stopped for the night and noticed the curtains in the front of their camper van were open and the driver’s door was slightly ajar. Local police suspect that they were gassed after receiving reports of Eastern European gangs preying on holidaymakers in the same way. Miss Keeney believes it is the only way they would have been robbed because she would have heard intruders. ‘I realised that someone had been inside the van so got up and noticed the door and curtains open and that my handbag was gone,’ she said. ‘The gassing thing happened to a friend of ours in England so it made me think the same thing must have happened to us. ‘We didn’t hear a thing and we are both light sleepers – especially in the camper van, where you feel and hear absolutely everything – so I’m sure we would’ve woken up. We also both had a thick head and a sore throat in the morning and just felt ill. Whatever we were breathing in wasn’t nice.’ Miss Keeney and Mr John, from Manston, Kent, left the service station and reported the theft to police. They carried on with their holiday but had to spend £200 on emergency passports so they could return to the UK on July 6. The couple lost around £200 cash, £300 worth of jewellery, passports and credit and debit cards after they stopped for the night at a service station in Lancon de Provence, southern France . Miss Keeney said: ‘It’s horrible. The thought of someone in my bedroom while we were both asleep is terrifying and makes you feel violated. ‘It hasn’t put us off going on another holiday like this because we’ve been doing it for the last 15 years and we don’t want them to feel like they’ve won. ‘We’re going to beef up the security on the van though. At the moment we have general locks and an alarm but it’s a motion sensor so we couldn’t have it on when we were sleeping. ‘You just don’t think things like this will happen to you though, so we assumed the locks we had would be fine.’ A police spokesman said: ‘They release a knockout gas through van air vents or windows – and can then rob the vehicle without anyone knowing. It’s been blighting this area for years.’ There have been previous reports of British motorhomers being targeted in this way and the Foreign Office has issued warnings. Local police suspect they were gassed as they slept because Mrs Keeney is certain the commotion would have woken her . It advises travellers to avoid staying overnight in roadside rest areas or car parks – warnings repeated by the major motorhome and caravan clubs and endorsed by Miss Keeney. ‘I would recommend going to a secure campsite in the future but at the time we thought we would be safe,’ she said. ‘Everyone’s had a kip at the side of the road before so it didn’t cross our minds this could happen. ‘We were obviously left feeling shaken up by the whole thing but we’re just thankful nothing worse happened to us and that it didn’t ruin our holiday.’ Despite the couple’s experience and similar reports previously, some experts remain sceptical that thieves would have the necessary expertise and equipment to render their victims unconscious by using gas. The Royal College of Anaesthetists believes it would be impossible. It has issued a statement saying: ‘Even the more powerful modern volatile agents would need to be delivered in tankerloads of carrier gas by a large compressor.’ The couple were robbed in Lancon de Provence, southern France (general view pictured)","Debbie Keeney, 54, and partner Bob John, 68, were robbed in south France .

"By . Julian Gavaghan . Created: . 06:16 EST, 7 March 2012 . Celebrity friends: Alex Hope, seen partying with Desperate Scousewives star Layla Flaherty has been revealed as the trader  who ran up a £203,948.80 bar bill . A self-proclaimed City whizzkid who spent more than £200,000 on Britain’s most expensive round of drinks has been criticised by his unemployed mother over his apparent night of excess. Alex Hope, 23, who claims he has earned a fortune by trading foreign currencies, is said to have forked out £125,000 on a single bottle of champagne along with £60,408 on other beverages and a £18, 540 tip. But his mother Tina Hope, 53, who lives in a three-bedroom terrace house in Deptford, south-east London, is shocked he could blow so much money at a time while millions of people are struggling to survive. The 53-year-old, whose home is worth . as much as her son’s bar bill, said ‘I just hope he . didn’t drink it all himself.' ‘I should suppose not. He’s a very good boy. I’m surprised by all of this,’ she told the Daily Express. Mr Hope, who lives in a Docklands apartment two miles from his mother, claims to have enjoyed a meteoric rise since leaving school. He says he began currency trading in his bedroom and also worked on market stalls and as a burger flipper. On his blog – alexhopefx, which has now had access restricted – he boasts: ‘Alex knows and loves the FX market. Throughout his youth, his passions were football and…currencies! ‘At the age of 11, Alex had a deep-rooted interest in the different currencies and relished trips across Europe where he could explore this interest first hand. ‘Opening his first account with just £500, in one day he’d doubled his money and turned the £500 into £1,100 by trading gold.’ ‘A talented, charismatic and thoroughly likeable man, Alex Hope exudes knowledge and you can’t help but respect and admire this self-taught and self-made young trader. Watch out trading markets, Alex Hope is kicking up a storm! Mr . Hope booked a table at the UnderGround night club at Liverpool’s . Hilton Hotel and ordered the 30-litre bottle of Armand de Brignac in . advance of his visit on Sunday night, according to bosses. Bubbly hell! The £203,948 bill, including the £125,000 charge for the giant bottle of Armand de Brignac champagne (right), pictured alongside a regular bottle . He . is said to have entertained celebrity guests, including Manchester City footballer Adam Johnson and Man United star Wayne Rooney’s wife Coleen. Two waiters were needed to carry in the bulky 99lb Nebuchadnezzar-size bottle of champagne, which is the equivalent of 40 standard ones. He also ordered 40 single bottles of Ace of Spade champagne along with £4,000 worth of Grey Goose vodka, which he handed them out to women there last night. Mr Hope settled the bill for £203,948.80 after paying a 10 per cent service charge – worth a massive £18, 540 – on top of the £185,408.80 drinks total. Although there is some scepticism about the receipt, which was released hours after the party, Mr Hope has been pictured with other celebrities in the past and has been seen drinking Amand de Brignac. In January he was photographed with Desperate Scousewives star Layla Flaherty at a party in London. Of Sunday night, one clubber said: ‘The club went wild when he popped this huge bottle of champagne, and they were handing out glasses of champagne to everyone in the VIP room. Heavy load: Two waiters were required to carry the 99lb double Nebuchadnezzar-sized bottle . Hot spot: Inside the PlayGround nightclub at the Hilton Hotel . Armand de Brignac is a non-vintage Champagne made by Champagne Cattier. It was introduced in 2006 and is a product of the Cattier family's Premier Cru vineyards. The bottle drunk by the businessman . Armand de Brignac Brut Gold is identifiable by its gold bottle with . pewter Ace of Spades on its label. It is described on its website as a . 'sumptuous racy fruit character that is perfectly integrated with the . wine's subtle brioche accents'. The bubbly contains Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Has been named the number one champagne in the world after blind tasting by wine experts. ‘Frankly there was no way all his group would have got through the bottle on their own anyway. ‘This guy was phenomenally generous and was buying everyone in the place a drink. ‘Funny thing was though that he . didn't seem to be drinking much himself and looked totally sober but he . was clearly having a great time.’ Nightclub . boss George Panayiotou ordered the DJ to play The Dawn of Man, the . iconic anthem to the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, as the huge bottle was . carried through. The clubber added: ‘The party went off with a bang and everyone was toasting this guy's generosity. ‘He was there with about 10 friends on a private table but after the big bottle came in they were mobbed with gorgeous girls. ‘There . must have been about 60 of them at any time vying for his attention and . he then ordered shots for every single woman in the club.’ Venue: Outside the night club in Liverpool . Manager of the club Vasco Carealho . said of Mr Hope: 'He was in the club on Saturday and he had pre-ordered the bottle. He has been to the club a couple of times. 'The fact he wanted to order . something like that was unusual and it was a surprise but we welcomed it . and we just created the best spectacle for the service of the bottle.'

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Top of the league: House prices in Cobham, Surrey, home to Chelsea defender John Terry and wife Toni, have risen by an average of £647,000 since 1995 . The commuter belt favourite of footballers and their wives has enjoyed Britain's biggest property price increases over the past 20 years, a new study has found. Since 1995, house prices in Cobham, Surrey, home to the likes of John and Toni Terry, have increased by an average £647,000 - more than in any other part of the country. Earlier this year it was reported that the Chelsea defender netted £16million for his dream home in the leafy enclave, having sold another house - built next door to the property - for £5.25million, making a total profit of £12million. And the star is not alone, as a Sunday Times analysis of all 19.1million home sales carried out since 1995 found Cobham, where where the Chelsea training ground is based, topped the league for the greatest price increases. Often dubbed the Beverley Hills of Britain, Cobham and neighbouring Oxshott are also home to Jamie and Louise Redknapp, Jenson Button, Colin Montgomerie, Westlife singer Shane Filan and Andy Murray, while residents pay more income tax than any other area of the UK. Like Terry, who built his nine-bedroom second home on the site of an older house, many newly-built mansions have taken the place of older homes - often built in the 1930s when Cobham started to attract commuters. 'We've seen properties built for just the land they're standing on and then demolished and a much bigger home built in their place,' estate agent Tony Webb, who works in the area, told the Sunday Times. Other Surrey idylls also experienced huge price increases in the last 20 years, with homes in East Molesey - where Manchester United's new left back Luke Shaw grew up, rising by an average of £588,000 and taking second place on the list. Tucked between the two, Esher was fourth in the table, with values soaring by £530,000. Celebrities including Gary Lineker and Chris Tarrant both have homes in the area. In Virginia Water, homes have shot up by £466,000, while in Betchworth the figure is £431,000. Home counties: All but one of the areas seeing the biggest increase in the value of homes are close to London . Value: Chelsea defender Terry reportedly netted £16million for his dream home in the leafy enclave, having sold another house - built next door to the property - for £5.25million, making a total profit of £12million. Home from home: Terry had built the nine bedroom white mansion next door to his former red-brick home . Outside of Surrey, homes in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire are now £550,000 more expensive than a decade ago, and in Keston in Bromley buyers can expect to pay an extra £500,000. All but one of the top ten are in the stockbroker-belt surrounding London, with Radlett and Harpenden in Hertfordshire also experiencing booming prices. Both areas are popular with Arsenal stars, past and present, such as Jack Wilshere, Lee Dixon and assistant manager Steve Bould, no doubt due to their proximity to the Gunners' training ground at London Colney. 1. Cobham, Surrey £647,000 . 2. East Molesey, Surrey £588,000 . 3. Beaconsfield, Bucks £550,000 . 4. Esher, Surrey £530,000 . 5. Keston, Bromley £500,000 . 6. Virginia Water, Surrey, £466,000 . 7. Salcombe, Devon £446,000 . 8. Radlett, Hertfordshire £438,000 . 9. Betchworth, Surrey £431,000 . 10. Harpenden, Hertfordshire £428,000 . Source: Sunday Times/Land Registry . Lucian Cook, of estate agency Savils, said: 'The figures show the extent to which the prime towns and super suburbs in a halo around London have become wealth magnets, often developing their own micro-markets.' In Salcombe, Devon, prices have risen by an average of £446,000. The town, nicknamed Chelsea-on-Sea, has the highest number of £1million pound properties outside of London and Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry, Sir Michael Parkinson and rugby World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward all have homes there. When adjusted for inflation, homes across the country have risen in value by an average of £135,000. Perhaps surprisingly, London was only ranked 15th with prices rising by an average of £402,000 - but this could be down to the fact that many of the most expensive properties in the capital are bought through companies and not recorded by the Land Registry as residential sales. Outside stockbroker belt: In Salcombe, Devon, where Mary Berry has a property, prices have risen by an average of £446,000 . The Chelsea effect: How sleepy Surrey became transformed into Britain's Beverley Hills, thanks to footballers and their WAGS . Not only did Roman Abramovich and Jose Mourinho transform the fortunes of Chelsea, they also turned the area around the Premier League club's training ground into the most exclusive in Britain. The gated mansions close to the west London club's Cobham base had been known as the ‘gin and Jag’ belt of Surrey but was transformed to the 'Beverley Hills of Britain' eight years ago. Traditionally it had been an area that attracted the UK's richest bankers, business people and celebrities, but footballers flocked from Chelsea, Kensington and other parts of London to leafy Surrey villages. Top draw: The Chelsea training ground at Stoke d'Abernon, near Cobham . John Terry and his Chelsea team mates began decamping to the area in 2005 after Chelsea's training ground moved to Stoke d'Abernon, near Cobham, after the then manager Jose Mourinho, now in his second spell at the club, decreed they should all live within minutes of it. The Special One himself also bought a grand home in the area, where a mansion costs an average of £4.5million, around £200,000 more than a year ago. His captain led the way and then team mates like Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, and Fernando Torres bought mansions for themselves and their WAGS. Terry fell out with Oxshott near-neighbour and once close friend Wayne Bridge, after an alleged affair with French underwear model Vanessa Perroncel, Bridge's then girlfriend. Terry was sacked as England captain. Under orders: During his first spell at the club, Jose Mourinho insisted that his players should live close to the training ground . Pricey: Residents in the borough of Elmbridge, inclduing Cobham and Esher, pay more income tax than any other area of the UK . Oxshott is reputedly the most expensive village in Britain. Like Cobham it is in the district council area of Elmbridge, which also includes ­Claygate, Esher and Weybridge, each a couple of miles apart. The leafy idyll is home to Elton John, Gary Lineker, Jenson Button and Andy Murray, and residents pay more income tax than any other area of the UK. The tax man receives £1.2billon a year from residents of Elmbridge, twice the amount drawn from Cardiff and Newcastle combined, and 200 times more than from Google. The footballers' needs, and those of their wives and girlfriends, are well catered for in the area - even the corner shops stock Dom Perignon and Krug champagne while traditional shops have been replaced with hair salons. The neo-classical houses on the Crown Estate in Oxshott are a favourite with the players. Each property is built on half-acre or so, separated from the others by red-brick walls and swathes of evergreen foliage.","Homes in Cobham, Surrey, have increased in value by average of £647,000 .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Three cuppas a day keep the doctor away: Tea can help your heart, according to new research . Drinking three cups of tea a day can help to ward off heart disease by improving circulation, scientists claim. A reaearch team found that high levels of tea-drinking reduce the ‘stiffness’ in arteries, keeping them younger and more elastic and speeding up circulation. The results were the same for all types of tea, including black tea and green tea. High consumption was classified as more than 450ml daily, which is three large cups a day, over the course of a year. Scientists in Taiwan measured the tea intake of 3,135 healthy people and compared it against the performance of their  circulation system. The findings, published in the science journal PLOS One, showed that those who drank more tea had a 22 per cent cut in measurements of arterial stiffness. People drinking moderate amounts of tea did not have a reduction in risk. Scientists say flavonoids found in tea . are responsible for the benefits, as these compounds have been shown to . improve arterial function, possibly by increasing nitric oxide . production. The findings come from the first study to evaluate the link between tea consumption and abnormal arterial stiffness using a brachial ankle test. The test compares blood pressure measured at the ankle to blood pressure measured at the arm, using a pressure cuff wrapped around both arms and ankles. It is a good indicator of how well blood flows around the body. Time for a brew: Tea has health benefits, it is claimed - though the jury's still out on the biscuit . The researchers from universities in Taiwan took account of factors such as age, sex, current smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise and obesity which can influence study findings. The volunteers were drawn from a healthy population who did not have diagnosed heart problems. The researchers said: ‘Arterial stiffness is characterised by arterial wall thickening and loss of elasticity. ‘Independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, arterial stiffness is a predictor of total mortality and future disease, such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart failure and stroke.’ The study added: ‘Tea, the most commonly consumed beverage after water, has attracted considerable attention for its potential cardioprotective effects. ‘The benefits of tea consumption in cardiovascular health are thought to be largely due to flavonoids, which may reduce arterial stiffness by augmenting nitric oxide production.’ This can help open up the blood vessels in the body, says the study. British institution: We are a nation of tea-drinkers, from David Cameron to Gordon Brown to Prince Charles . Overall, flavonoids found in tea are thought to control inflammation, reduce excess blood clotting, promote blood vessel function and limit furring up of the arteries. One cup of tea provides 150-200mg of flavonoids and it is the best source in the British diet. In terms of the delivery of antioxidants, two cups of tea is equivalent to five portions of vegetables or two apples. Other research shows tea drinkers have a lower risk of cancer, of around 30 per cent. Dr Tim Bond, spokesman for the industry body the Tea Advisory Panel, said ‘Of note is that the study group was drawn from an apparently healthy population and as such is a good reflection of a normal group of tea consumers. ‘This is good news for Britain’s tea drinkers as this study contributes to the growing evidence of tea’s benefits for the health of the heart and vascular system.’","Tea has plant materials called flavonoids which make arteries more elastic .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A sect named Defenders of Christ that was broken up in Mexico last month forced women to participate in orgies, discouraged baths and made people eat raw animal organs, the wife of a cult leader has claimed. Mexican immigration authorities raided the sex-driven sect's house in the northern state of Nuevo Laredo on January 25, rounding up 14 foreigners, including its Spanish leader Ignacio Gonzalez de Arriba, and 10 Mexicans. Gonzalez de Arriba saw himself as the reincarnation of Christ and used the Internet to recruit adherents, offering classes on 'bio-programming', alternative health care, psychic powers and sexuality, according to the Victim Support Network, which helps people who flee sects.

The Argentina-based Victim Support Network said that the sect was present in 80 countries, with 4,000 victims in Mexico and 10,000 in the rest of the world. The Internet classes began in 2004, charging people between $1,300 and $130,000, the network said. Those willing to shell out the maximum fee secured the title of 'apostle of Christ' within the sect, whose estate in northern Mexico was dubbed 'The Monastery.' Once there, they were tasked with recruiting new followers. 'I saw them arriving from Chile, Bolivia, Spain, with suitcases and the money that was demanded in cash,' Castro said, showing copies of emails from sect leaders telling how much the victims had to pay. The sect's followers were treated with cruelty, including humiliation and psychological torture, the network said.","Blanca Castro lived with group for ten months in Mexico before escaping .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A moped rider was run over and killed after a freak incident in which he came off his vehicle and was thrown into the road. Police say the 20-year-old was lying on the ground when he was hit by 'definitely one and possibly two' vehicles on the southbound carriageway of the A3 at Hurtmore in Surrey. Seconds earlier he had come off his machine in mystery circumstances and now police have launched an urgent appeal for witnesses. The fatality happened on the A3 southbound (pictured) in Surrey between the turnings for the A31 and the B3000 . A police spokesman this afternoon told MailOnline that a vehicle stopped at the scene after colliding with the man, just before midnight last night. But officers believe it is possible a second vehicle may also have collided with the man and have urged the driver to come forward. One theory is that the motorist may not have realised a collision had taken place, though the circumstances surrounding the death are still being investigated. The incident happened between the turnings for the A31 and the B3000. 'The moped is believed to have collided with the carriageway and the rider was then struck by another vehicle,' a spokesman said. 'The moped rider, a man in his 20s, was pronounced dead at the scene around 12.30am today. 'The road was closed in both directions while emergency services, including the air ambulance, dealt with the incident. 'The northbound carriageway was reopened around 1.15am, while the southbound carriageway was reopened around 5am.' Sergeant Gary Wright, from the Surrey Police collision investigation unit, said: 'We believe the moped has collided with the carriageway causing the rider to be flung from it and he has then been struck by another vehicle. 'We have spoken to a number of witnesses but would particularly like to speak to anyone travelling southbound on the A3 around the time of the incident who thinks they may have been involved in a collision or has sustained damage to their vehicle which was not there before. 'We would also like to speak to the drivers of any other vehicles who stopped to assist at the scene but did not wait to speak to police, as we believe they may have information which could assist our investigation.' Police said that they were withholding details of the victim until all his relatives had been told of the tragedy. A post mortem examination will be carried out on the young man's body and an inquest will be opened and adjourned next week.","Moped rider came off his vehicle and ended up lying in the road on busy A3 .

Cove House collapsed after waves generated by the hurricane compromised the pilings of the old building. Cove House, located at scenic Sycamore Cove, in Point Mugu had served generations of lifeguards since the 1950s and ‘had seen it all’. Scroll down for video . Bye bye Baywatch: A historic lifeguard training building collapses into the sea at Sycamore Cove, in Point Mugu, California . ‘It’s a loss for the program from an emotional and administrative standpoint,’ Craig Sap, California State Parks' Angeles District superintendent told LA Times. ‘Some people came and stood by, mournfully watching the structure go.’ ‘This thing was bulletproof, it had seen it all.’ Sap said about the building . The Cove House Lifeguard Administrative Building had become a popular filming location over the decades and featured in television series such as Baywatch. The high surf generated by Hurricane Mare, later downgraded to a Tropical Storm, in the eastern Pacific rolled onto Southern California beaches again on Thursday night, showing signs of diminishing but still bringing warnings of possible property damage and dangerous rip currents. Mayday: Cove House collapsed after waves generated by former Hurricane Marie compromised the pilings of the old building. Down it goes: The historic training building on the Californian beach had served generations of lifeguards since the 1950s and 'had seen it all' No saving: The  Cove House Lifeguard Administrative Building had featured in several films and television series, including Baywatch . However, meteorologists said the weather conditions had peaked and would gradually subside through Friday, with high surf advisories expected to expire that evening. Tropical Storm Marie was spinning more than 800 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was expected to be further downgraded to post-tropical cyclone status Thursday night, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving toward the northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds dropping to 45 mph. Surging surf arrived on the Southern California coast late Tuesday and was wildest on Wednesday. Last show: The waves from Tropical Storm Marie finally won the battle against the old building . Blocks of oceanfront homes flooded in low-lying Seal Beach south of Los Angeles, pilings were knocked off the Malibu Pier and a boatyard on Santa Catalina Island was battered. Warnings or advisories were posted for hundreds of miles of coastline. The National Weather Service called it the region's most significant southerly swell event since July of 1996. Lifeguards worked to keep all but the most experienced surfers and swimmers out of the water but still made hundreds of rescues. Beaches were left with deep gouges and abrupt drop-offs more typical of the aftermath of winter storms than summer.","Historic lifeguard training building collapsed in Los Angeles .

Good news for consumers - Optus will pay customers who terminate contracts with  rivals up to $200 in an aggressive bid to claw back ground in the cut-throat mobile market. Under a new offer launched on Sunday, people who abandon their existing contracts and move to 24-month Optus plans will have the money added to their plan's credit to help offset cancellation charges. The move is timed to take advantage of the pre-Christmas influx of new smartphone models, such as the iPhone 6, which Apple is expected to unveil this week. Optus is set to pay customers who terminate contracts with rivals up to $200 in an aggressive bid to claw back ground in the cut-throat mobile market . Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone 6 and is expected to feature a 'one handed' mode to allow typing on the bigger screen Sourced: www.martinhajek.com &Twitter @deplaatjesmaker . 'It is a key period for consumers,' said Vicki Brady, Optus' customer chief. 'People don't want to have to wait out the last few months of their contract to get that latest smartphone.' Customers eager to upgrade to newer models can earn extra credit on their new plan when they trade-in their existing phone. Apple is expected to unveil a male and female version of the iWatch Sourced: www.martinhajek.com &Twitter @deplaatjesmaker . The aggressive move is a notable departure from conventional price competition, but unsurprising given Optus' poor recent performance in the mobile space, said Telsyte senior analyst Foad Fadaghi. Australia's second-biggest telco lost 126,000 mobile subscribers in the last financial year to Telstra, with the overall figure falling to 9.4 million. Meanwhile, Telstra added close to one million new mobile subscribers as it reached a total of some 16 million, which includes non-smartphone users. Vodaphone has five million subscribers. 'Telstra has been the fastest growing contracted vendor in the market,' Said Fadaghi. 'This is a shot across the bow.' But it also comes as Australians increasingly abandon high-value lock-in contracts and opt instead for flexible pay-as-you-go and prepaid plans, which allow for more frequent phone changes. 'This won't appeal to everyone,' Brady allowed. 'But it certainly appeals to a very big portion of the market who are still happy to take a contracted plan and get a brand new smartphone without having to pay for it outright.' Fadaghi said Optus' rivals would likely launch aggressive counter strategies in the coming months. 'This is a win for consumers if we see increased competition around the launch of the new (Apple) handset (and) some of the barriers come down for switching,' Mr Fadaghi said.

But for the Manly Ferry, the dramatic conditions at Sydney's Northern beaches proved difficult. The eight metre swells battered the vessels as they tried to make their way across. Senior forecaster Jake Phillips from the Bureau of Meteorology says the large swells weren't just confined to Sydney but were right across the NSW coast. 'A deep low pressure system over the Tasman sea a few days ago was slow moving,' he said. 'Over long periods of time, winds started to whip up seas and turn into swells, due to a low pressure system consistently driving southerly winds over the coast.'

But the question is, are we likely to see those winds and large swells continue?  Apparently not with nothing on the horizon according to Mr Phillips. 'Now we are on a gradual decreasing trend, the swells are moving over to New Zealand, the winds are easing and a high pressure system is coming across, bringing lighter winds,' he said.

But already the show is rife with fights and drama, with a contestant already kicked off for smuggling in a cell phone, another evacuated to hospital for severe dehydration and one revealing a secret pregnancy. Add to that the skinny dipping and polyamorous contestant Dedeker - who kisses her two boyfriends and girlfriend goodbye before entering the compound north of LA County - and Fox appears to be making good on the reported $50 million they have invested in the project. The show - which premieres Sunday night - has already developed a large online following, after a live stream of the Utopia grounds made available this week garnered 1 million viewers, according to Entertainment Weekly.

At least two couples have already formed as well, according to EW. The pregnant contestant has not yet been named but is due in December. Opening night: The show premieres on Sunday September 7, 2014 at 8pm . Fox is gambling large on the series, investing millions of dollars in the show that challenges the 15 participants to create their own mini societies on the secluded piece of land. 'Utopia' is what the network called its 'boldest' and 'most groundbreaking social experiment.' People from all walks of life were selected from 5,000 applicants to be dropped into the secluded plot of land in California, where they will build their ideal civilization for one year . The 'Utopians' start with no more than $10,000 and have to decide how to use it to develop their new economy and develop more of the land. Fifteen participants will remain in isolation for a year while they build a new civilization for Fox's new reality behemoth, 'Utopia' Aside from a barn with a couple of cows and some chickens, participants have to build new structures and find their own food . The show will air on Tuesday and some Fridays, and is expected to be Fox's big programming bet this fall . The roster also includes a bellydancer, a naturalist, a Manhattan lawyer, a Libertarian and a veterinarian technician. 'This is the most pure form of reality that I have ever produced in my career,' boasts executive producer John de Mol, the man behind 'Big Brother. 'Utopia,' which debuts on Sept. 7 with a three-night premiere, comes with 200 crew members, hundreds of cameras and round-the-clock video streaming. Fox has scheduled the show for Tuesdays and some Fridays, counting on it to replace 'X Factor' and 'American Idol.' The network will also stream the show online 24/7. The 15 participants on 'Utopia' come from all walks of life, from a belly dancer to a veterinarian technician, a chili farmer and a pregnant woman . But so far, the series has seen plenty of snags. Insiders say the network stands to spend $50 million on just 20 episodes — and is also struggling internally with a group of new producers involved in the show, TheWrap reported. 'The bill has arrived and it is on the very high end of staggering,' one network executive told the news outlet. Executive producer Conrad Green told Variety the cost for the set was 'not insignificant,' though he wouldn't give any more details. And this is a time of internal changes at Fox. The man behind the project, ex-chairman Kevin Reilly, moved on in June — leaving a group of incoming executives to inherit the schedule he created, Variety reported. It is also the first big project for Simon Andreae, in charge of alternative, who joined the network in October. The dutch version of the show premiered in January and has thus far been a success, industry insiders say.","The 15 participants entered the remote California compound one week ago but drama has already broke out .

Briana Brooks, 21, of Decatur, succumbed to her injures Thursday. Her husband-to-be, 24-year-old Jeronta Brown, was shot dead during the incident in Decatur last Saturday. According to police, the young couple, who also had an 8-month-old baby, were kidnapped a week ago, handcuffed, shot in the head and dumped in the street 17 miles away from home. Scroll down for video . Slain couple: Briana Brooks, 21, died Thursday from injures sustained during a weekend kidnapping that resulted in the shooting death of her 24-year-old fiance, Jeronta Brown . Targeted: Brooks and Brown were returning to their home in Decatur, Georgia, August 30 when they were ambushed by masked men . The 21-year-old woman was seven months pregnant with the couple's second child, 11Alive Atlanta reported. Doctors at Grady Memorial Hospital were able to deliver her via C-section before taking the mother off life support. The couple's grieving relatives said that on August 30, Brooks and Brown took their infant and Jeronta's 14-year-old sister out to get some late-night dinner. When they returned home after midnight, they were allegedly ambushed by a group of masked men. The teenage girl with them was able to get away with Brooks' infant, but the couple were not as lucky. According to Brooks' aunt Myesha Brooks, after restraining the couple the abductors unsuccessfully tried to enter their family’s house by pretending to be FBI agents. The woman told WXIA that initially, Brown was able to escape but when he saw that his fiancee was not behind him, he came back for her. Growing family: The young couple, who were planning to get married soon, had an 8-month-old baby and another child on the way . Tragic end: four hours after their abduction, Brooks and Brown were found handcuffed and shot in the head in Atlanta . A short time after Brooks and Brown were pushed into the back of a brown van and whisked away, the man's mother and stepfather got a call demanding a $150,000 ransom. ‘These boys are not playing,’ Kawana Brown recalled her son telling her on the phone after she asked the kidnappers to speak to him. Jeronta Brown begged his mother to raise the money, and Mrs Brown promised to do all in her power to free him. Early Sunday morning, a motorist came upon the heavily pregnant woman and her fiance lying in the street in Atlanta with bullet wounds to the head. Brown was pronounced dead on the scene. In cold blood: Jeronta Brown died at the scene; his seventh-month pregnant fiancee was rushed to a hospital, where doctors were able to deliver her baby via C-section before taking her off life support . So far, no arrests have been made. Police are now trying to determine if the couple's abduction is related to another kidnapping that took place in the area Thursday. In the second case, the victim escaped unharmed. She was picked up in East Atlanta and found alive 18 hours later. Police say her abductors also issued a demand for ransom, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Ever had so much chest hair you  didn't know what to do with it? Here's the answer - courtesy of a star stylist who is sculpting world monuments on his clients' torsos. Daniel Johnson has turned his talents from cutting the England football team's hair to trimming Stonehenge, Sydney harbour and the Great Pyramid of Giza into men's upper body shag. Scroll down for video . Tuft job: Wiltshire's amonument Stonehenge is now available in chest hair form thanks to the bizarre 'manscaping' antics of top stylist Daniel Johnson, from London . Bushy: Each design by the 32-year-old stylist took two and a half hours to create - but how do the Great Pyramid and Sphynx of Giza match up to the real thing? Coiffed: The New York city skyline was one of the most difficult, requiring four types of grooming device and more than 150 individual incisions into the volunteer's hair . The 32-year-old was inspired to create his bizarre designs by a trend sweeping social media which saw men shaving their chest hair into the shape of bikinis. But he insisted his efforts were considerably more complicated. Each challenge took two and a half hours, required four types of shaving tools and up to 176 individual 'incisions'. He also forged the Manhattan skyline, which he said was one of his most difficult 'manscaping' achievements to date. The challenge left the hair at five different lengths - 0mm, 1mm, 2mm, 5mm and 15mm - but it was a tough task because the hair was so short and curly compared to that found on the men's heads. Furry talented: The designs include Sydney harbour with its world-famous opera house - and there's even a 'reflection' which has remained to signify the water . In action: Stylist Daniel Johnson, 32, has worked with the England football team, boy bands on The X Factor, former N-Dubz singer Dappy and footballer Mario Balotelli . Mr Johnson said: 'It was a challenge due to how the hair is formed and how it reacts to even the most precise shavers'. Whether the trend will spread remains to be seen . 'Creating such intricate designs on men's chests was  a challenge, due to how the hair is formed and how it reacts to even the most precise shavers,' he said. 'I set out to achieve something that made people consider the possibilities of grooming and style and challenged my abilities in order to keep up with the high standards expected from my clients'. Mr Johnson, whose 'art' was commissioned by the shaving products firm Braun, has styled footballers including Wayne Rooney and Gareth Bale and has appeared in fashion and men's magazines. He has also done work for the famously mohawked footballer Mario Balotelli alongside N-Dubz singer Dappy and boy bands on The X Factor. His stunt came after men shaving their  chest hair to form the shape of a woman's bikini top became the latest bonkers trend to hit social media. Unsettling: The idea sprang from the odd #ChestHairBikini movement on Instagram, which sees men using razors to create exactly what the name suggests . Quite the look: Some #chesthairbikini showcasers appeared, unsurprisingly, to be at bachelor parties and festivals, while others pose solo or take bathroom selfies . Oops: Other participants, however, appeared to be unaware that they were taking part in a social media craze. The odd trend has been around since at least 2012 . The origins of the #chesthairbikini Instagram movement are unknown - with some snaps of the bizarre strain of manscaping as long ago as 2012 - but it received widespread coverage last night. Some #chesthairbikini showcasers appeared, unsurprisingly, to be at bachelor parties and festivals, while others pose solo or take bathroom selfies. A poll by a shaving products firm last year claimed more than 70 per cent of men admitted to trimming their body hair, with almost a third taking more than 20 minutes to get the job done.","London-based Daniel Johnson has cut hair for the England football team, The X Factor and N-Dubz singer Dappy .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A Jewish matriarch was so determined to protect her family from Nazi persecution, she hid herself and them in an underground cave until their country was liberated - eighteen months later. Esther Stermer lived a peaceful, rural existence in a small Ukrainian village with her six children until the Germans invaded in late 1941. Hellbent on annihilating the Jewish people, the soldiers rounded up more than a thousand Jews and sent them to their deaths. Several Jewish families escaped the Holocaust thanks to the courage of Esther Stermer, front row, second from left . Sam Stermer, in green, and his brother Saul Stermer, with yellow kneepads, revisted the cave nearly 70 years later . But Mrs Stermer and her husband Zaida were determined that their innocent family would survive, whatever it took. So, she and five other Jewish families from the area packed up their belongings one cold October night in 1942 and fled, in the dark, to a sinkhole masking the entrance to an underground cave, five miles north of their home in Korolowka. A new documentary, No Place On Earth, tells the story of Mrs Stermer's courage more than 70 years ago. She and her family had already survived one year of German occupation, but knew that the shadow of death was creeping ever closer. Her son Sam Stermer, now 86, told ABC News that the family's secret was their utter determination never to give in. The cave they settled in was pitch black, damp, and lay beneath ground that Nazi soldiers would march over, deep in the Ukrainian countryside. Sam and Saul Stermer said that their underground home was 'paradise' because they were free . The six families, with 38 people in total, ended up hiding there for 18 months, until it was safe to go above ground in their own land again. During that time, the families lived in complete darkness, digging out toilets and showers and more living space as they concentrated on surviving until they could come out again. At night they foraged for food, and in the day time they hid deep in the darkness. Mr Stermer's older brother Saul Stermer, now 92, said: 'You went to sleep and you had a pillow and you covered up with good blankets - what else you want?' Saul Stermer, his nieces Sima and Sonia Dodyk, and his brother Sam Stermer play themselves in the documentary . What the family had and prized above anything was their freedom - they had escaped the invading forces, and they would continue to do so for more than 500 days. During that time, Esther Stermer had to defend her family once, when German SS soldiers raided the first cave. Coming face-to-face with the men they had lived in fear of for so long, Mrs Stermer held her ground, despite the fact they were pointing guns at her. Sam Stermer said: 'And she says ""What are you afraid of here?  The Fuhrer is gonna lose the war because we live here?""' Saul and Sam Stermer, seen here in the film, say they would not have survived without their determined mother . The soldiers left, never to return, and finally, in April 1944, the Russians liberated the area and the hidden families were able to climb out of the cave into the light. Last year the Stermer brothers returned to the cave for the first time, for the film.  They told how after the war, they travelled to Canada and set up a business, which they still run there. Today the survivors and offspring of those who hid in the Ukrainian caves number more than 125, and the film, which will be on limited release in the U.S. today and will be released in Germany next month, tells the story of their courage. Their survival is the longest uninterrupted underground survival in recorded human history.","Esther and Zaida Stermer and their six children lived underground to survive .

The call was places after 2pm on Saturday, the call threatened that a 15-year-old boy was being held against his will. Special Emergency Response Teams and the dog squad joined officers at the residence but two hours later officers discovered that it was all a prank. The dog squad was also called to the hoax situation on Saturday in Brisbane where it was believed a 15-year-old was being held hostage . It's been confirmed by police that the boy inside the home did not place the call to the police. Brisbane Regional District Officer Inspector Rob Graham was outraged at the hoax.

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . The tale of the last Thylacine is a relatively sad one, left to die out in the cold. One of the largest known carnivorous marsupials in modern times, the Thylacine, which is greek for 'dog-headed pouched one' is more commonly referred to as the Tasmania Tiger, because of its stripped back. The animal, which was native to continental Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, is thought to have become extinct in the 20th century, although sightings are still being reported, yet none have been proven. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO . Is it really extinct? :The Thylacine, called the Tasmanian Tiger or Tasmanian Wolf, was a large marsupial that is now almost certainly extinct. The female (pictured) was the last one to be captured and died in the old Hobart Zoo. But there have been a number of reported sightings although none have been proven . 19th Century book illustration of Thylacine (Thylacinus Cynocephalus). The last known Tasmanian Tiger died in captivity due to being left out in the cold . The last captive Tasmania Tiger, which was later referred to as 'Benjamin', spent several years behind bars in the Hobart zoo after being caught in the Florentine Valley in 1933. Its gender still a mystery, the animal died three years later on September 7, believed to be as a result of neglect. It was locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters and died due to the exposure of an extremely cold Tasmanian night. This Thylacine features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen, showing it pacing backwards and forwards in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933 by naturalist David Flea.

Stuffed! : The Thylacine was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. It's believed the last known Tasmania Tiger died in captivity after being left out in the cold. Now on the anniversary of the animals death Australia has observed National Threatened Species Day (September 7) The Thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland before British settlement of the continent, but it also survived on the island of Tasmania, along with other species such as the Tasmanian devil. Intensive hunting encouraged by bounties is generally blamed for its extinction, mercilessly persecuted for allegedly killing sheep. But new research shows it actually had jaws too weak to tackle anything much larger than a possum. Other factors believed to be responsible for its demise include disease, the introduction of dogs and humans taking up its habitats. Surviving evidence suggests that it was a relatively shy, nocturnal creature with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and abdominal pouch, like a kangaroo. On Australia's threatened species list : The Tasmanian Devil, thought to be related to the Tasmanian Tiger . More than 300 animals are listed as threatened by the Australian government, some of those including the Tasmania devil and the country's icon, the koala . Although there had been a conservation movement for the protection of the animal since 1901, official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced in July 1936, nearly 60 days before 'Benjamin' or the last known Thylacine died in captivity. In 1996, on the sixtieth anniversary of the last Tasmanian tiger’s death, 7 September was declared ‘National Threatened Species Day’. It is a day to be able to reflect on what happened in the past and how people can help protect Australia's threatened species in the future.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Two fishermen were stunned after they caught two albino lobsters in the space of a week - despite  the rare crustacean being one in 100 million. Bert Philbrick caught a white lobster off Owls Head, less than a week after Joe Bates caught one about a mile off the Rockland breakwater in Maine. The unusual lobsters are extremely rare and look translucent compared with the more usual green and brown lobsters which most people are more familiar with. Rare: Two rare albino lobsters flank a rare yellow lobster on a deck in Owls Head, Maine . The haul came as a surprise for lobsterman Bates, who has 300 traps off Rockland and has been catching lobsters since 1990. It seems that he . has been on a roll of late and also caught a yellow lobster on Monday, . estimated to be one in 30 million, but that wasn’t the first time that . that had happened. However, when he saw the white lobster in his trap he said that he was ‘surprised and shocked.’ But despite his rare find, there was some debate about the exact breed of the lobsters. The white shells naturally led to the conclusion that the lobsters were ultra-rare albinos. Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine’s Lobster Institute said he’s only seen a couple of albino lobsters in his lifetime. Translucent: In this photo provided by Owls Head Lobster Company, two albino lobsters sit in a crate with other lobsters . He told The Portland Press Herald: ‘We get blues (and) we get red ones every summer. That’s not a big deal. This is if they’re actually albino.’ On closer inspection, Bayer said, it seemed at least one, if not both, have a blueish hue. ‘I don’t think they’re albinos. It looks like there’s some pigmentation there. Still, whatever they are is highly unusual, it’s nothing I’ve seen before.’ A true test of their colour would be to feed the white lobsters food high in carotenoids, like crab and periwinkles because this type of food will darken the shell, if they’re not albino. And if they are cooked, true albinos would stay white, say experts. Both white lobsters were under legal size and about 5 or 6 years old according to Terry Watkinson, owner of the Owls Head Lobster Co., where the fishermen brought their rare catches. Blue lobster: This photo provided by Meghan . LaPlante shows a blue lobster caught by her father Jay LaPlante off Pine . Point in Scarborough, Maine . Normally, that would mean they’d have to be thrown back into the ocean to mature for two years– but seeing as they are so rare that’s probably not going to happen. One of the white lobsters has already been snapped up by Brooks Trap Mill, a Thomaston lobster supply store. The other will go to the Maine State Aquarium in Boothbay Harbor, adding to the spectrum of coloured lobsters already on display there. Last month, two blue lobsters were caught in Scarborough and were taken to the Maine State aquarium. Blue lobsters are estimated by the Lobster Institute to be one in 2 million. Earlier this year, a lobsterman pulled a one-in-30 million calico lobster in New Hampshire. It was sent to a Hampton aquarium. In late July, a yellow lobster ended up in a supermarket tank in Florida, where a customer bought it and sent it to an aquarium in Rye, New Hampshire. But none compare to the ultra-rare albinos. If any more are found, experts suggest that there could be some unusual breeding in the area.

The Abbott Government celebrates its first anniversary in power with the Prime Minister pledging to keep Australia safe in a time of increasing global uncertainty. Tony Abbott returned to Sydney after a three-day visit to India and Malaysia to spend Father's Day and mark his first year in office on Sunday. The prime minister said his government had delivered on its promise to tackle debt and repeal the carbon tax, and had signed two free trade deals with Australia's major trading partners Japan and South Korea. Tony Abbott arrives at Sydney Airport after a three-day visit to India and Malaysia on his first anniversary as prime minister on Sunday morning . Mr Abbott said the rise of extremism in Syria and Iraq and the downing of MH17 in eastern Ukraine had tested Australians like never before. 'As a nation, we've also faced serious challenges in the past year because of the increasingly uncertain world in which we live,"" Mr Abbott said in a video address to mark his first year as prime minister,' Mr Abbott said. 'In an increasingly uncertain world, we are determined that our nation will be secure.' The prime minister has two reasons to celebrate on Sunday: He spends Father's Day with his dad in Sydney, as well as his one year anniversary in office . Mr Abbott with his father Richard Abbott leave a Fathers Day reception at the Epping Club on his first anniversary as prime minister and on Fathers Day in Sydney on Sunday morning . Mr Abbott has promised to spend an additional $630 million on counterterrorism measures to combat the threat of Australians returning home from battlefields in the Middle East. While it will be a cause for celebrations, Mr Abbott has had unforgettable missteps that have overshadowed the prime minister's domestic agenda over the year. It was the wink that sparked an outrage when he took to air-waves in May to discuss Budget matters with Gloria the grandmother. Mr Abbott pledges to keep Australia safe in a time of increasing global uncertainty . The 67-year-old telephone sex worker told how the planned $7 GP co-payment and increased cost of medication would leave her out of pocket up to $850 a year. 'I would like to ask you if you'd like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation,' she said. 'I'm a 67-year-old pensioner with three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life-threatening. 'I'm just surviving on around $400 a fortnight once I pay my rent and I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. That's the only way I can do it. ‘What do you suggest I cut out Mr Abbott? Food, electricity, firewood, Christmas and birthday presents to my grandchildren? Or should I just die and get out of your way.’ Mr Abbott has promised to spend an additional $630 million on counterterrorism measures to combat the threat of Australians returning home from battlefields in the Middle East . While the prime minister forgot he was being filmed during the ABC Radio interview, he winked at radio host Jon Faine as the pensioner revealed she had worked on a sex line to make ends meet. But it was his response to the surrounding death of Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney in Afghanistan, which got the prime minister in hot water. Mr Abbot had been prone to shrugging off before suggesting to soldiers: ‘It’s pretty obvious that um... well, s*** happens doesn’t it?’ At least his Canadian Gaffe was a little more than embarrassing when he referred Canada as ‘CanADIA’ during his North American trip.","The prime minister has two reasons to celebrate on Sunday .

The entertainer was has travelling from his Yorkshire home to a gym in Thornaby-on-Tees. Scroll down for video . Roy 'Chubby' Brown was driving from his home Yorkshire to the gym in Thornaby-on-tees when he was pulled . The policeman told Roy 'Chubby' Brown that he was a fan to which he replied: 'some f****** fan you are' Brown told The Sun: 'It was my manager ringing. I was on the phone long enough to tell him I'd call him back. 'The officer who stopped me told he he was a fan. I said, some f****** fan you are.' The squad car followed Brown from the road into the gym's car park where they handed him a traffic offence report. Now senior officers will decide whether to recommend issuing Brown with penalty points or ordering him to attend a road safety course. Almost three weeks ago, Brown received four points on his licence after he was filmed by speed camera van while driving down the road in his white Lexus while reading a newspaper. A month earlier, Brown was caught jumping a red light which cost him a further three points. If Brown receives three points for his latest offence he will be sitting on 10 - just two points shy of a driving ban. In 2003, Brown was fined £200 after he assaulted a fan who swore at him in Blackpool. Brown explained: 'I have traditional values and I wanted the man to stop swearing in front of women and children who were on the pier. In January 2010 Brown was acquitted on a charge of common assault at Teesside magistrates' court. Brown denied assaulting the woman in a Middlesbrough car park in December 2009.

"By . Belinda Robinson . A distraught pet owner has told how her dog died after she became overheated during a grooming session at PetSmart. Cindi Tousel took her dog Gracie to PetSmart in Mentor, Ohio, last Saturday. The dog, a six-year-old Newfoundland had been groomed at that branch for several years, but when she arrived Tousel was told that her dog's usual groomer was away on holiday. Owner: Cindi Tousel, a dog lover . took her pet Gracie to PetSmart in Mentor for routine grooming last week . Dog: Gracie was a 6-year-old Newfoundland loved by Tousel and the rest of her family . Tousel said when she found out that a new groomer had to carry out the appointment she conducted a short interview to make sure that her dog Gracie would be in good hands. However, just four and a half hours later, PetSmart staff told Tousel to take her dog to an emergency vet. Tousel said that when she picked up her dog, Gracie was drooling profusely and could not walk. By the time that she got Gracie to the vet, her body temperature had spiked to 109 degrees. A normal body temperature for a dog is 102 degrees Fahrenheit. The vet said that overheating was causing Gracie's organs to shut down. The next day her beloved dog died. Tousel told WKYC-TV: ‘It shouldn’t happen to anybody who loves their dogs or cats.’ ‘You take a perfectly healthy dog in whose tail is waggling and she is kissing everybody in the butt like she always does and you bring out a dog who is suffering and dying and there’s no excuse. PetSmart: Four and a half hours after Gracie was dropped off at PetSmart, staff told Tousel to take the dog to the emergency vet . In happier times: Sadly a vet told Tousel her dog's temperature had spiked to 109 degrees and she died a day later . PetSmart staff told Tousel that it was very hot in the back room where the dogs were kept. In a statement, PetSmart said: ‘The safety and well-being of the pets in our care is our top priority. ‘We are conducting a full investigation into this incident and will take appropriate action based on our findings.’ Tousel said she instructed the groomer not to dry Gracie and doesn't know if a heated blow dryer was used but Gracie was completely dry. She said that the store manager told her the company would pay for her vet bills, which cost more than $2,200. The company's corporate office has been in touch with her also and sent flowers. Newfoundlands are known to be heat sensitive; something Tousel would have expected a dog groomer to know. She is considering her options at this point but hopes all groomers change their policies and make sure the back rooms are kept cool and dogs are monitored for heat issues.","Cindi Tousel took her dog Gracie to PetSmart in Mentor, Ohio, last week .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . An incredibly rare sighting has been captured by Southern Cross University scientists of a rare Australian dolphin species. The elusive aquatic animal shows some rather unusual behaviour is known for by beaching itself in order to feed. A pod of Australian humpback dolphins was spotted by the scientists in the Fitzroy River estuary of Central Queensland. Scroll down for video . Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) strand-feeding on the Fitzroy River . The research team led by Dr Daniele Cagnazzi, of the University’s Marine Ecology Research Centre said that large splashed in the distance is what caught the group’s attention. ‘We soon realised we were witnessing an incredible event,’ she said. ‘The humpback dolphins were observed swimming a few metres away from the shoreline.’ This behaviour allows dolphins to concentrate fish against the mud bank before charging at them at high speed. On some occasions the fish were washed onto the shoreline by the wave of water associated with the dolphin's beaching, resulting in a full body exposed beaching. While other times it was only partially beached with more than half of their body exposed. ‘In these shallow waters the agility of the dolphin’s neck region enabled them to reach for the stranded fish before sliding back into the deeper water, thanks to the soft mud.’ Three years ago, the research team spotted a similar occurrence at the Fitzroy River. The rare Australian humpback dolphin's fin breaks the water in the riverlands of the Fitzroy River . The dolphins show 'herd' the fish they are hunting towards the shoreline then force them out of the water where they slide out of the water then eat their prey . They saw an animal which appeared to be stranded and dead on a mud bank however upon a closer look they realised the animal was alive as it slid back into the water. The Fitzroy River’s network of narrow deep creeks and channels with steep muddy edges provides the perfect habitat for the display of this behaviour. Prior to this, the only other written report of beach hunting behaviour in Australian humpback dolphins was in 2007 near Cape Van Diemen in the Northern Territory. Dr Cagnazzi and her team’s discovery shows that hunting and foraging techniques have advanced from just hunting in the comforts of the water but are able to corner their prey out of the water. The behaviour also shows evidence of social learning or even a learning culture. Until now, the rare ‘beach hunting’ behaviour has been documented in only two species: the Orca in Argentina; and bottlenose dolphins in Georgia and South Carolina in the US, Sado Estuary in Portugal, and Shark Bay and Peron Peninsula in Western Australia. The research team will keep collecting information to better understand the factors promoting this behaviour.","A rare Australian dolphin species which sometimes beaches has been spotted for the second time in three years .

"By . Peter Rook For The Mail On Sunday . Convicted sex offenders could pick up passengers in licensed minicabs under new Government plans, according to critics who say they pose a ‘real danger’ to the British public. The Government’s Deregulation Bill, which will be debated in the Lords next month, could permit anyone to drive a licensed vehicle without going through a council vetting process. The proposals come as the full extent of taxi drivers’ involvement in the Rotherham child abuse scandal – in which some victims were raped in cabs after being picked up outside schools – continues to emerge. The Government’s Deregulation Bill, which will be debated in the Lords next month, could permit anyone to drive a licensed vehicle without going through a council vetting process . Currently, anyone looking to operate as a private hire vehicle operator must obtain a licence from a council, which checks for previous criminal convictions and can refuse licences if it feels the applicant is not a ‘fit and proper person’. Operators are able to operate only in the area in which they are licensed. Under deregulation, a licensed driver could operate outside his area and enforcement officers in that area would not be able to check if he has been vetted. It will also allow licensed private hire operators to pass work to drivers who may not have been through the vetting process. Critics have hit out at the move. Rachel Griffin, director of personal safety campaign group the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said: ‘The changes are going to put people across the country in real danger as they will make it much easier for someone with a past of violence and sexual offences to pose as a legitimate driver.’ A Department of Transport spokesman said: ‘The Deregulation Bill will not put taxi passengers at risk and drivers will continue to have their backgrounds routinely checked. Councils will have strong tools to assess drivers’ and operators’ suitability and to carry out enforcement activity. ‘The Disclosure and Barring Service [which replaced the criminal Records Bureau] will allow licensing authorities to discover any new convictions during the lifetime of a driver’s licence.’ Police estimate there are more than 1,000 sexual assaults each year involving unlicensed cab drivers in London alone.","Government’s Deregulation Bill will be debated in the Lords next month .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Secret recordings have emerged of Australia's Manus Island facility, showing inside the asylum seeker compounds. A former detention centre guard took photographs of the 'filthy' living conditions before he quit his job in disgust. Beau Mitchell told the ABC that he wasn't surprised Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei died from an infection he caught at the detention centre. Hamid Kehazaei, who had been detained on Australia's Manus Island facility, died on Friday after an infection in a cut foot deteriorated to septicaemia . A previous image captaured by AAP photographer of a sewing room in the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea . Another previous image of a broken window in Mike compound at the detention centre on March 21 . Rubbish from the Australian run detention centre on August 1, 2013 . 'There's no air conditioning, the beds are extremely close together. The living standards are pretty quite filthy,' Mr Mitchell said . 'Often they'd be standing on concrete to have a shower that was literally falling apart underneath them, just completely rotting away.' Former detention centre guard secretly recorded the 'filthy' living conditions at Manus Island . Mr Kehazaei, 24, is believed to have spent days seeking treatment for a cut on his foot that had been there for weeks whilst he was detained at Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. The 24-year-old was initially transferred to a Port Moresby hospital to treat his septicaemia last Wednesday, where he had a heart attack before being sent to Brisbane. He was then declared brain dead on Tuesday at Mater Private Hospital on Tuesday. His family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support on Friday. Mr Mitchell says he used secret cameras to document the conditions inside the detention centre. He says he was so repulsed that it prompted him to quit his job in June. However he stresses that medical staff at the facility are doing what they can to best tend to the needs of detainees. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed Mr Kehazaei's death on Friday evening. 'I am very saddened by this man's passing and on behalf of the Australian government I extend our deepest sympathy to the man's family and friends,' Mr Morrison said in a statement. 'My department has and will continue to provide support to the family and has been in contact with family members during the course of the man's treatment,' he said, adding that the name and age of the man would not be released, subject to agreement from his family.' Mr Kehazaei's death has caused outrage among many, including the Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young and refugee advocate Ian Rintoul. But Mr Morrison rejected suggestions the care provided to Mr Kehazaei was inadequate. The 24-year-old was transferred to a Port Moresby hospital (pictured) after suffering from septicaemia following a cut on his foot. He suffered a heart attack at the hospital and was taken to a Brisbane hospital . The Iranian asylum seeker was declared brain dead on Tuesday at Brisbane's Mater Private Hospital on Tuesday . 'When someone becomes ill they receive outstanding care from the people who work as part of our mainland detention network,' he said. Mr Morrison has asked the immigration department's chief medical officer to review Mr Kehazaei's treatment. 'I will base my assessment of that treatment on facts and not Facebook,' he said. Mr Rintoul claimed asylum seekers on Manus Island sometimes had to walk through raw sewage and that Mr Kehazaei's death was 'senseless and inexcusable'. 'Hamid's death speaks for the medical neglect, and to the culture of punishment, and indifference that pervades Manus Island,' he said. 'Infections and skin disease are endemic in the detention centre. It is unhygienic, unsanitary and unsafe.' Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said Labor continued to be concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers. Labor has called for the review to be made public as soon as possible.","Beau Mitchell used secret cameras to record conditions inside asylum seeker compounds on Manus Island .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . He may be the king of French haute cuisine, with 33 Michelin stars to his name. But that has not stopped superchef Alain Ducasse from taking the  decidedly un-Gallic decision to remove meat from the menu of his famous Paris restaurant in the name of 'naturalness'. The internationally-celebrated French chef has announced that his three-star restaurant at the Plaza Athénée Hotel will reopen on Monday with dishes centred on fish, vegetables and organic cereals. Scroll down for video . Michelin-starred chef, Alain Ducasse, decided to take meat and cream off the menu at Plaza Athenee, Paris . He said that the decision to opt for lighter, vegetarian-style cuisine was because he believes people should conserve the planet's precious resources. 'The planet's resources are rare, we must consume more ethically and equitably,' Mr Ducasse told AFP. Dishes will include black rice cooked in the oven with shellfish, calamari and octopus; Mediterranean monkfish mixed with bulgar and quinoa with shellfish. Cream is missing from the new menu and sugar will be used as sparingly as possible, according to the chef. The restaurant in the luxury Plaza Athénée Hotel in Paris will reopen on Monday following a refurbishment . Mr Ducasse is the head of more than twenty restaurants worldwide, including three with three Michelin stars that bear his name . 'My obsession is to remove sugar,' he said, adding that desserts will also be revolutionised. 'People ask us for cream or caramel with chocolate,' he said, adding that he would not give in to such requests 'otherwise it's just globalisation. We all eat the same fat and the same sweets,' he said. Ducasse also insisted that he would use 'humbler' types of fish because they often posed more of a challenge than higher-class fare. Comparing a sardine to the more prestigious turbot, he said that cooking the former required almost 'surgical skills'. 'The humbler the product, the more attention it demands,' he said. Signature dishes on the menu in 2012:                          Signature dishes on the new menu . - Smoked swordfish and French bacon on toast            - Black rice cooked in the oven with shellfish . - Frogs legs beignets with a sorrel dipping sauce          - Calamari and octopus                               - . - Guinea fowl pie                                                            - Mediterranean monkfish mixed with bulgar . - Fresh Ewe's milk cheese, caramel and pepper            - Quinoa with shellfish . 'In this case it's 15 per cent sardine and 85 per cent work.' Most of the organic cereals and vegetables served at the restaurant, which reopens on Monday, will be grown in the gardens of the Palace of Versailles, built by France's 'Sun King' Louis XIV. The restaurant, which had a three-star Michelin rating until it closed along with the hotel for renovation in October, will offer other surprise choices. 'One mustn't be scared to serve red wine with fish,' said sommelier Laurent Roucayrol. Plaza Athénée said: 'It's a new expression of contemporary French haute cuisine.' Mr Ducasse is the head of more than twenty restaurants worldwide, including three with three Michelin stars that bear his name. Alain Ducasse and Franck Cerutti at the Louis XV restaurant in Monaco, which reclaimed its third star . Alain Ducasse was born in Orthez in 1956 and educated on his parents' farm in Castel-Sarrazin, two hours south of Bordeaux, in France. By the age of 12, he decided he wanted to be a cook, inspired by his grandmother's skill. He began an apprenticeship at the Pavillon Landais restaurant in Soustons, near Biarritz, four years later and also trained at the Bordeaux hotel school. Mr Ducasse also built up experience at Michel Guérard’s restaurant in Eugénie-les-Bains, Aquitaine, while also working for Gaston Lenôtre during the summer months. Relocating to the Côte d'Azur, Mr Ducasse became chef of the restaurant at the Hotel Juana in Juan-les-Pins where he was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985. Two years later, he was approached by the Hotel de Paris with an offer to take over the gloriously ornate Louis XV restaurant. In an act of seemingly foolish bravado, Mr Ducasse agreed to a clause in the contract by which he agreed to win three Michelin stars in four years - an almost impossible task. When Mr Ducasse moved his Parisian restaurant into the sumptuous Hôtel Plaza Athénée in 2000, the Michelin Guide graced it with its highest accolade after it had been open less than five months. But at the same time, Michelin removed a star from Le Louis XV, in spite of the fact that the chef, the menu remained unchanged. In 2006, he was awarded three stars for his restaurant at the Essex House, making him the first chef ever to simultaneously run three three-starred establishments. He is now head of more than twenty restaurants worldwide, including three with three Michelin stars that bear his name. In 2013 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement on the World's 50 Best Restaurants List. Forbes estimated his current wealth at around £7.4million. While at the Dorchester in 2012, Ducasse was honoured with three Michelin stars.","Alain Ducasse has decided to remove meat from the menu at Plaza Athenee .

"By . Patricia Kane For The Mail On Sunday . Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has been bombarded with so many abusive threats since she spoke out against independence that she no longer feels safe in Scotland. The Glasgow-born and based Ultimo founder was subjected to a vitriolic social media hate campaign after becoming one of only a few business leaders to come out in favour of the Union. Speaking for the first time about the online abuse, she said: ‘It’s a very sad day when you can’t voice an opinion without getting threats. Scroll down for video . Pro-Union: Michelle Mone was one of the few Scottish business leaders to speak out against independence . ‘Yet, for the first time, I don’t feel safe in Scotland and that’s horrible. It’s my home.’ Ms Mone, 42, took to Twitter to express her fears about an independent Scotland’s £6 billion deficit and the risk of losing the pound. And she vowed to move to England if Scotland voted Yes in the referendum on September 18. After receiving a stream of abuse in response, the mother of three added: ‘Can’t believe the amount of hatred this vote is causing. It’s extremely sad & will no doubt cause damage either way to the country I love.’ One troll wrote: ‘The quicker we vote yes, the quicker u get to f*** ya tramp!’ In June, vicious Twitter trolls targeted Harry Potter author J.

I’m a good person who employs a lot of people in Scotland, both Yes and No supporters, and we all get on. ‘We should all be able to live in a country where you can express views and not be vilified for it.’ But Ms Mone says her commercial experience tells her that ‘Alex Salmond’s business plan is flawed’.","Lingerie tycoon was one of few business leaders to come out pro-Union .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A suspected illegal immigrant held on to a motorhome axle for more than 100 miles along busy motorways in a desperate bid to reach Britain, it has been revealed. Geoff and Christine Mullin were driving back home to Barry, South Wales when the discovery was made - having brought their vehicle through the Channel Tunnel from Calais. The stowaway had been holding on to the underside of the motorhome while the couple travelled at speeds of up to 65mph. Scroll down for video . As many as 2,000 migrants from Africa and Asia are encamped in and around Calais and increasingly desperate attempts are being made to flee to Britain . When they slowed for a traffic jam on the M25 near Cobham Services in Surrey, the man – believed to be of African appearance – jumped out from his hiding place and ran into a nearby field. The incident, on Tuesday, happened in the same week that another stowaway was discovered hiding in a woman’s car as hundreds more tried to storm a ferry in the port of Calais. The Sun reports that Mr and Mrs Mullin believe the man grabbed hold of the chassis while they were waiting at a pet passport control area in Calais. He is reported as saying: ‘My mouth dropped. Shocked is an understatement. To think someone could be under your van. Asylum seekers have been seen clambering over fences, climbing in to trucks and hiding in tourists' cars as they risk their lives attempting to reach Britain . ‘He must have been getting tired - he probably didn't expect to have to hold on for that distance.' As many as 2,000 migrants from Africa and Asia are encamped in and around Calais and increasingly desperate attempts are being made to flee to Britain. On Thursday, a man was arrested in Shepherdswell, Kent, on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant after he hid in the back of a woman's car as she travelled through the Eurotunnel. Sue Taber, 59, called police after discovering a man hidden in her Fiat having driven from Spain to France and back to Britain. Ms Taber was shocked to find a human leg protruding from out behind the driver's seat after parking up outside her home following the 53 mile cross-Channel journey. Sue Taber, 59, called police after discovering a man hidden in her Fiat having driven from Spain to France and back to Britain . She said she noticed the stranger as she let her two dogs out of the car and said the 5ft 8in man, aged between 18 and 20, emerged from her vehicle shouting: 'I'm an orphan, I'm an orphan'. Ms Taber, who believes the man got into her car while she left it briefly unattended and unlocked at Calais, France, admitted she had felt something nudging her back on her journey, but assumed it was just one of her dogs fetching a ball. A day earlier, there were chaotic scenes as more than 250 immigrants stormed a Britain-bound P&O ferry. They tried to force their way on board the vessel at Calais and security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on them as they attempted to overpower officials. There were chaotic scenes last week as more than 250 immigrants stormed a Britain-bound P&O ferry . They tried to force their way on board the vessel at Calais and security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on them as they attempted to overpower officials . Cross-Channel travellers are now being warned to stay alert when travelling through the French port, where more than 80 police officers and 40 riot police have been drafted in as part of heightened patrols. Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said today that the company's site at Calais was extremely secure but added: 'Everybody travelling through Calais should be vigilant whenever they leave their vehicle.' The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, has begged David Cameron to visit Calais to tell the waiting hordes that Britain was 'no El Dorado'. France needs to 'get its act together' and deal with growing numbers of asylum seekers in Calais rather than blaming Britain, a former home secretary has insisted. Lord Howard of Lympne said he had 'some sympathy' with the mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, amid increasingly desperate efforts by migrants to get into the UK. But he said she was 'directing her frustration and her anger at the wrong target' by demanding that London 'take responsibility' and threatening to blockade the port. Lord Howard of Lympne, left, says the mayor of Calais should be directing her frustration at president Francois Hollande, right, over the increasing numbers of asylum seekers in Calais . 'The general principle which every member state of the European Union has subscribed to is that refugees, people fleeing persecution, should apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach,' Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'France used to take this very seriously. When I was home secretary, which was quite a long time ago now, we had an agreement with France under which if people came to the UK from France and claimed asylum we returned them to France and France dealt with their claim. That is what really ought to happen.' The Tory peer said the root issue was that France had 'lost control of its borders' after signing up to the Schengen agreement that 'dismantled' restrictions between countries. Lord Howard of Lympne said he had 'some sympathy' with the mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, amid increasingly desperate efforts by migrants to get into the UK . He added that the previous French administration under president Nicolas Sarkozy had recognised that and threatened to withdraw from Schengen - which the UK never signed up to. 'The mayor of Calais ought to be directing her frustration at president (Francois) Hollande and getting him to take the kind of action that president Sarkozy was talking about,' Lord Howard said. 'We have control of our borders. But it is the countries of the Schengen agreement that ought to get their act together and deal with this problem. We have retained control of our borders, and it is about time members of the Schengen agreement did the same.' Yesterday, a suspected illegal immigrant was found clinging to the underside of a caravan on the M20 in Kent – as two more were found hanging from underneath a mobile home. Police were first called to reports of a person clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it travelled along the M20 towards London at 9.16am. Officers located the man hanging from the motorhome between junctions nine and eight, the section between Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, and arrested him at the scene. Then Kent Police found another two men clinging to the underside of a mobile home, they said yesterday.","Geoff and Christine Mullin had brought motorhome through Channel Tunnel .

Just some deer running down the middle of the road on the Golden Gate Bridge,' joked Luca Jackson on Instagram. CHP Officer William Ogilvie tells the Chronicle that it's not uncommon for calls about 'animal hazards' to work themselves out before the officers arrive because animals don't like traffic any more than humans do. NBC reports that the deer seemed entered the bridge from the south, according to CHP Officer Andrew Barclay. The deer forced three northbound traffic lanes to a halt as they scampered all the way from San Francisco toward Marin. 'They pretty much created their own traffic break,' Barclay said. 'That could be what saved the deer from getting hurt ... If it was lighter traffic the cars would have been moving faster,'he added.

Brandon Howell was accused in the late 1990s of killing two teenagers in Johnson County, but in 2009 a jury found him not guilty. The 34-year-old also has a prior conviction in connection to a 1999 burglary where a cat named Tony was beheaded. He was released on parole in 2011. A car to die for: Neighbors say the Hursts and Choucroun were killed because they prevented the gunman from staling this vintage Jaguar from a nearby home . Clue: Police found this 2002 Toyota Highlander that was stolen from one of the crime scenes . Tom Brewer, the father of 16-year-Tabitha Brewer who was killed along with her boyfriend, Nick Travis, 18, in 1998, told the Kansas City Star Wednesday that when he saw Howell's picture on TV, he immediately recognized him as the man who was acquitted in his daughter's murder. ‘I feel sorry for the jurors who acquitted him the last time because that is going to be hard for them to live with,’ Brewer said. ‘I believe justice is always served one way or another.’ The triple homicide - the most deadly incident Kansas City has seen in more than two years - left people living in the middle-class neighborhood shaken. ‘In the last few years we’ve had many young families move in. It is a very, very desirable place to live,’ Jo Lombardino, a member of the Woodbridge Homes Association, told the Kansas City Star.

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . A curious kitten had to be rescued after getting its tiny head stuck in the parasol hole of a garden table. The eight-week-old feral cat found his way into a garden shed in the Lee area of Lewisham in London, where the table was being been stored and became wedged inside it. Luckily his cries were heard by a passer-by who called the animal charity and when they opened the shed, they discovered the exhausted cat completely stuck. Scroll down for video . Eight-week-old kitten Parasol, who got his tiny head stuck inside the parasol hole of a garden table inside a shed in Lewisham . Officers were then forced to contact an on-call vet from the nearby Celia Hammond Animal Trust to sedate the kitten - now named Parasol- to stop him from struggling and possibly injuring himself. The table then had to be dismantled so the kitten's head could be freed safely and it is unknown how long he had been stuck for. RSPCA Inspector Nick Wheelhouse said: 'A member of the public heard a young cat's cry and upon investigation found the kitten with his head stuck in the parasol hole of a wooden table. 'The poor little thing was completely stuck and struggling to free himself. 'We had to be very careful not to hurt him, so we asked a vet from Celia Hammond Animal Trust to sedate him and keep him safe while we dismantled the table to free him. Parasol has been paired up with fellow stray Marina left, and both are now being cared for by staff including vet Serena Holmes and volunteer Jade Lockley at the Celia Hammond Rescue Trust centre in Lewisham, right . 'Thankfully once he was sedated the kitten was freed from the table and was taken back to the surgery to be checked over.' Parasol is now recovering from his ordeal at the Celia Hammond Animal Trust's centre in Lewisham, although he did not suffer any injuries. He has been paired up with another kitten, a black cat called Marina and it is hoped that they will be rehomed, finding new owners together. Lesley Mills, rescue and rehoming manager at the centre said: 'Parasol is doing extremely well. Thankfully he just needed some TLC to get him back on his feet. 'He has now made a friend in Marina and we are hoping they can find a home together once they are both ready to be rehomed.'","RSPCA were called after a member of the public heard a young cat crying .

"By . Jonathan Petre And Andy Gardner For The Mail On Sunday . THE only Hurricane that fought in the Battle of Britain and is still flying today is up for sale for £2.5 million – more than 30 years after it was found as scrap in India. The aircraft, which regularly takes part in flypasts, was restored by a vintage car buff who discovered the wreck by chance while seeking old Rolls-Royces. But retired businessman Peter Vacher is now selling the 1940 Hawker Hurricane Mk 1 through an American dealer, fuelling fears that it could be lost to Britain. Scroll down for video . Sole survivor: The Hurricane R4118 (pictured) is thought to be the last plane from the Battle of Britain still flying . Hurricane R4118 flew 49 combat sorties during the worst days of the fighting and shot down five enemy aircraft. Hurricanes, alongside Spitfires, were at the centre of the country’s heroic defence of the skies in 1940 and had a crucial role until the end of the war, but the vast majority were then scrapped. Mr Vacher, 72, said: ‘This Hurricane is a one-off. There is no other British plane like it from the Battle of Britain that is flying today. It was a labour of love to recover and restore it and I have enjoyed watching it fly for the past ten years. Heroic:  Wing Commander Bob Foster, who was responsible for three of the plane’s five ‘kills’ in the Battle of Britain died last month aged 94 . ‘However, it is time for somebody else to take it on – and my hope is that it will stay in the UK or in Europe. Obviously, there is a possibility that it could go further afield. But it is such an iconic British plane. The sight and sound of it is the Battle of Britain. The public absolutely love it.’ The former printer spotted the aircraft’s rotting hulk in 1982 on a visit to a university at Benares, north-east India, but did not immediately realise what it was. The plane had been given to engineering students in 1947 after the war in the Far East came to an end. The fuselage was lying in a compound with the propeller, wings and tailplane spread out over the ground. Mr Vacher, of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It looked like a pile of junk, but once I had found out what it was, I became obsessed with restoring it.’ He returned to India in 1996 and, after a long battle with local bureaucrats, bought the fighter for £25,000 in 2001 and shipped it to Britain. It took four years and 32,000 hours of restoration work, including renovating a Rolls-Royce Merlin III engine, before the Hurricane was once again airworthy. It has since flown in public more than 100 times. Wing Commander Bob Foster, who was responsible for three of the plane’s five ‘kills’ in the Battle of Britain, died last month aged 94. A spokesman for the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust said: ‘It would be disappointing if Bob Foster’s Hurricane were to leave the country. It is very special and it would be a shame if it could no longer be seen over the UK.’ The aircraft is being offered for sale through Platinum Fighters.

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . James Clarke, 22, who was paralysed in a motorbike crash in 2009, choked on a feeding tube after it became blocked in this throat at his home in Walsall, West Midlands, while carers left him unsupervised . Two carers watched TV and played on their phones while a quadriplegic patient they were supposed to be supervising suffocated to death in the next room, an inquest heard. James Clarke, 22, who was paralysed in a motorbike accident in 2009, choked on a feeding tube after it became blocked in this throat at his home in Walsall, West Midlands. An inquest into his death heard how two female carers were supposed to be monitoring him every 15 minutes throughout the night - but only checked on him every three hours. Instead, Beverley Kent and Mandy Evans watched television in the living room and chatted and joked between themselves as James died next door. Emergency services were called to the address after the carers found him unresponsive at 6am when his feeding peg bleeped. The inquest at Smethwick Council House heard Mrs Evans gave chest compressions under instruction from 999 handlers until the ambulance arrived. However rigor mortis had started to set in, further resuscitation attempts proved unsuccessful and he was declared dead at the scene. Black Country coroner Robin Balmain yesterday slammed Mr Clarke's quality of care and ruled his death was due to neglect. He said he would be writing to the Care Quality Commission demanding answers about the standard of care provided. The coroner ruled that Mr Clarke, who a tracheotomy tube fitted to enable him to breathe following his accident, died of asphyxiation after the tube became blocked. Mr Balmain blasted Complete Care Service - the company in charge of his care package - and described their approach as 'profit over performance.' He also criticised the Walsall Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which employed the firm, for not checking that the correct care was being given. Mr Balmain concluded that Mr Clarke's death on April 4, 2011 was due to neglect compounding injuries suffered in the motorcycle accident. However, he said he sympathised with the carers, describing their training as 'slapdash' and said 'insufficient attention' was given by Walsall CCG as to what the care company was doing. Mr Balmain added: 'They seem to have missed some pretty obvious failings.' Mr Clarke was paralysed in a motorbike accident in March 2009, when he just 19 (pictured before the crash) Mr Clarke had been left dependent on round-the-clock care following his accident in March 2009. He fell from his bike and slid into the path of an oncoming car when he was aged just 19. After nine months in hospital he returned home where he was cared for by his mother Paula with help from carers. The carer's responsibilities included checking on his comfort and breathing, and changing his tracheotomy tube when necessary. Night-time carers were assigned to him so his mother could sleep. At 10pm on the night he died, the two women arrived to take over from Mrs Clarke who then went to bed. Over the next eight hours the women only checked on him three times - at 1am, 4am and finally at 6am. Giving evidence at the inquest, Mrs Kent claimed they had been told by Mrs Clarke's mother not to sit in the same room as her son in case they disturbed him. But Mrs Clarke disagreed and the claim was dismissed by the coroner as 'unimaginable.' Black Country coroner Robin Balmain slammed Mr Clarke's quality of care and ruled his death was due to neglect at the inquest at Smethwick Council House (above). He said the carers had received 'slapdash' training . In her statement to police, Mrs Kent said it was 'common practice' to sit in the living room. Mrs Evans told police she was playing on her mobile phone as the two women chatted and watched TV with the volume turned down. Asked how they would know when the tube required clearing, Mrs Evans said Mr Clarke would cough or give a 'rattling' sound. Although the tracheotomy tube often became blocked and had to be cleared, carers had only been provided with classroom training but no practical tuition. The inquest also heard that another firm employed to carry out the training had not been told until the last minute that it was for tracheotomy care, so no notes were handed out or demonstrations given. Complete Care Services quality manager Manjit Kaur said she expected the instructions for Mr Clarke to be checked 'every so often' to mean 'every 15 or 30 minutes'. After the case Steve Smith, managing director of Complete Care Services, said: 'As far as we were concerned, external trainers had signed our staff off as fully trained.'","James Clarke died from asphyxiation after tracheotomy tube became blocked .

"By . Ruby Warrington for The Mail on Sunday . Wine and dine: Sweets such as wine gums are good for a quick energy boost . I am 73 and running in my first half marathon. Can you advise me on diet, both before the event and on the day? Firstly, congratulations on stepping up to the challenge! In the US last year, only four per cent of marathon-runners were  over the age of 65, so you’re part of a fitness elite. Your nutritional needs before and during the event won’t differ significantly from your fellow runners, but your age does mean there are a few things to consider when it comes to your recovery. During training, it’s common wisdom that you should significantly increase your carb intake because the body’s preferred fuel for running (or any endurance sport) is glycogen, which is how the body stores carbohydrate. Aim for 60 to 70 per cent of your daily calories to come from carbs, which can be in the form of whole grains, fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products. Endurance runners also need  50 per cent more protein than sedentary adults (about 12 to 15 per cent of your daily calories), as it’s essential for muscle growth and repair. To figure out the right amount, multiply your weight in kilograms by 1.3, or your weight in pounds by 0.6, to calculate the number of grams of protein you should consume per day. On race day, seasoned marathon-runners refuel regularly – before the tank runs out – with concentrated energy sources. There are specific products for this, like sports drinks, chews and gels, but wine gums and other sweets are popular. Another trick is to drink beetroot juice before the race, as it helps blood vessels dilate and increases blood flow to muscles during exercise. Which brings us to recovery nutrition. Older runners are more susceptible to muscle damage – upping your intake of Vitamin C, omega-3, sulphur-containing amino acids, bioflavonoids and antioxidants in the weeks after your race will help rebuild and maintain muscle tone and strength. Good luck! My husband and I really need to slim down, but it’s hard to know where to start. When our daughters were younger, we got lots of exercise running around after them or going on healthy walks, but they’ve long since left home. I don’t think we eat badly, we don’t eat ready meals or junk food and I don’t have a sweet tooth, except for a few sugars in my tea. But clearing out a cupboard recently, I found a favourite old dress – size 10, and I’m now squeezing into a 16. I’m worried for my husband’s health as he’s bigger than his father was when he died of a heart attack. There’s a trendy local gym but it’s not for us – we’re both mid-50s. My daughter got me down to a Zumba class but I hated it. What else can we do to lose weight? Self control: Ruby advices a woman to start eating smaller portions and cut out the daily sugar in her tea . You’re right to address this issue now. The earlier you can get down to a healthy weight, the better – especially with your husband’s family history of heart disease. About 75 per cent of weight loss is down to what you eat and it’s great that you cook your own meals, because it should be easy for you to start planning lighter options. Simply eating less – aka portion control– is the first place to start! My friend Robyn bought smaller plates to stop her overeating. As a visual guide, each meal should be able to fit comfortably into your two cupped hands. Be really honest with yourselves about how much you snack between meals; try sticking to a solid three meals a day. Keeping a food diary will help you keep track. Those sugars in your tea all add up, too. There are roughly 30 calories in two teaspoons of sugar, so at four cups a day that’s 120 calories – the equivalent of a small packet of crisps. Time to cut it out. Have you ever thought about trying a vegan diet? Following the guidelines in the hit book Forks Over Knives, which recommends a plant-based, wholefood diet as a way to combat all kinds of health issues, helped Bill Clinton, also a high-risk candidate for heart disease, drop more than two stone. And who says your healthy walks have to stop just because your daughters have left home? If you’re lucky enough to live somewhere you can get out and go rambling, make the most of it. It sounds as if long walks with your husband are something you’ll  both enjoy. Gwyn way or the highway: Gwyneth Paltrow likes to keep herself - and her men - in shape . On the subject of exercise  for couples, I love the story about Gwyneth Paltrow sending her new squeeze  Brad Falchuk (the co-creator of Glee) off to train with scary Tracey Anderson. Fitness fanatic Gwyneth is rumoured to work out two hours a day, six days a week to maintain her trim physique, and obviously wants her man showing the same commitment. While we can’t  all be expected to maintain an A-list exercise regime like theirs, working out with your other half can be a great motivator in achieving your fitness goals. A word of caution though, Gwynnie – Tracy Anderson’s method involves eating a lot of puree, and I’m pretty sure the way to a man’s heart isn’t through feeding him baby food... Festival season is a distant memory – but one ‘did I dream that’ moment that keeps coming back to me was Conservative MP David Tredinnick’s talk on astrology for health with Daily Mail star-gazer Jonathan Cainer. As vice-chairman of the Government’s herbals working group, to say Mr Tredinnick – who openly champions complimentary medicine – is outspoken would be an understatement. He now seems to be giving David Icke a run for his money by admitting he believes studying your astrological chart can give vital clues into an individual’s health and wellbeing. Well, David, I salute you! I find astrology fascinating, and  in the Indian Ayurvedic medical system, used by millions of people, working with the planets is often  key to diagnosing the right course of treatment. The idea is that the horoscope is a blueprint of the whole being, reflecting the complex interaction of body, mind and spirit. I take the odd painkiller, rarely,  and am lucky never to get ill. I was raised with homeopathy as the family go-to for many everyday ailments. I know a lot of people out there think its all crackpot stuff, but tell me this: is exploring alternatives more or less foolish than the constant antibiotic overuse that has left us on the brink of these life-saving drugs becoming useless? Leaky Gut Syndrome  is the latest digestive ailment for neurotic New Yorkers. The unappetising ‘condition’ is blamed for everything from food allergies, low energy levels and joint pain to thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions and  a slow metabolism. It refers  to a weakened gut wall developing holes that allow undigested food particles, bacteria and toxins to pass into the blood stream. IBS  and bloating can be early symptoms, while multiple  food sensitivities are another giveaway. Common causes are said to be stress, poor diet and eating unsprouted grains, sugar, genetically modified crops and dairy products. DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A DIET OR FITNESS QUESTION FOR RUBY WARRINGTON?

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . South Yorkshire Police and Crime commissioner Shaun Wright has received the threats in the wake of the damning report into child sex abuse in Rotherham . The police chief who has refused to step down from his £85,000-a-year post in the wake of the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal has started to receive death threats, the force has claimed. South Yorkshire Police and Crime commissioner Shaun Wright, who has faced calls from the Prime Minister to resign from his taxpayer-funded post, has allegedly been targeted after it was revealed that 1,400 children were sexually exploited over a 16-year period in the town. It follows accusations he and several other senior officials failed to protect the victims from the systemic abuse. Mr Wright, who was the councillor responsible for children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, said the revelations were a 'huge surprise' to him. But it was revealed last week that in his post as cabinet member for children’s services in Rotherham, he must have been aware social services were dealing with hundreds of children at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. As a result, senior politicians including David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Theresa May have said the crime tsar should step down. However he is still clinging onto his taxpayer-funded job, despite a vote of no confidence by Sheffield City Council last week and protesters turning up at his office daily. South Yorkshire Police confirmed it has reviewed the safety of several people since the report's publication to ensure 'proportionate safety measures' are in place - but the force refused to confirm whether protection has been stepped up around Mr Wright. In a statement, the crime commissioner's office said: 'We welcome feedback from all citizens and we strongly advocate the right of the public to participate in democracy through legitimate means, such as peaceful public protest. There is however a line in law that cannot not be crossed. 'Where threats are made to any individual, the individual has a right to protection and the level of protection provided in such cases is a matter for operational policing.' A South Yorkshire Police statement said: 'The publication of the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham has led to a number of people wishing to express views against those featured in the report. 'South Yorkshire Police has carried out risk assessments for a number of people and locations and our aim is to ensure proportionate safety measures are in place. This is regularly reviewed. 'We will respond to any specific incidents appropriately, balanced against the right to peaceful protest and in line with legislation.' Ed Miliband is one of the many senior politicians who have called for Mr Wright to step down after the scale of abuse in the South Yorkshire town was unveiled . Mr Wright's deputy Tracey Cheetham had been under little public pressure to go. However, the mother-of-three decided she could no longer carry on amid the outrage over Mr Wright’s defiant stand. When she stepped down, she said: ‘It is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and, with this in mind, I believe it would have been the right thing for Shaun Wright to resign. One Rotherham victim, who was abused at 14 by an older man, told the Mail that Mr Wright ‘should be ashamed of himself’. Jessica, now 29, said: ‘The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward. He needs to accept his part in it and quit.’ Mr Wright, who was a member of the Labour party until he quit on Wednesday and has met Ed Miliband, cannot be sacked by the police or by politicians because he was elected by the public in 2012. Last week ,Sheffield City Council passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in Mr Wright after Labour members joined a Lib Dem call for him to go. Mr Wright was Labour's candidate for PCC, but the party have retracted their support for him in the wake of the scandal. When Labour threatened to throw him out following the publication of the report, Mr Wright reacted by resigning from the party. Mr Wright issued a statement before last week's Sheffield vote, which said: 'The findings of Prof Jay's report are not about one person or one organisation. 'These findings are about taking a multi-agency approach to dealing with bringing the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice. 'I've had many messages of support, many of which are from partners, encouraging me to remain and to continue my work on prioritising and tackling the extremely important issue of child sexual exploitation (CSE). I'm sure that all partners involved in tackling this issue will work with me to do just that for the sake of past victims and for the sake of safeguarding potential future victims.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . British women typically start going grey at the age of 33. A study reveals that redheads may spy their first silver strands at 30, while brunettes go grey at 32 and blondes at 35. The research, by hair product Charles Worthington Instant Root Concealer, also suggests that late nights cause those in the entertainment industry to go grey earliest, at just 27, while call centre workers may resist the longest - until their mid-30s. A study has found that British women typically start going grey at the age of 33 (stock picture) And it seems the discovery of their first grey hair is a traumatic moment for most women. One in three women - or 33 per cent - instantly feel old and 13 per cent admit feeling embarrassed. One in five women said they felt shocked and upset when they found their first grey hair. To combat their grey locks, the vast majority of women reach for the dye and cover it up. The study found that 88 per cent do this straight away and 32 per cent resolved to hide the grey until the day they die.

A quarter of women took silver hair to be a sign of wisdom and experience. One in nine British women claim they welcome silvery locks and will never try to cover their grey hair.

"By . Patricia Kane For The Mail On Sunday . It was perhaps his most famous act of open rebellion – unfurling the Scottish flag above David Cameron’s head at Wimbledon as Andy Murray lifted the men’s singles trophy last year. But the person behind the plot was actually Alex Salmond’s wife, Moira, who smuggled the enormous Saltire into the All England Club in her handbag. It was a typical gesture from a woman who has been conspicuous in her absence over the past few weeks as her husband works the Yes campaign trail. Scroll down for video . Spotted! It was Moira Salmond (centre, behind David Cameron) who helped smuggle a giant Saltire into Wimbledon in her handbag - only for her husband to unfurl it in a cheeky tribute to tennis ace Andy Murray . While Mrs Salmond refuses to engage in the public displays of devotion expected of political wives, behind the scenes her support for her husband has been unwavering. At 77, she is 17 years his senior, and those who know the couple say he relies on her shrewdness and wise counsel. They also credit her with having the final say on his return to the leadership of the SNP in 2004. Intriguingly, while the couple’s views are mostly aligned, he has said: ‘She’s much more radical than I am now in all sorts of things.’ Mrs Salmond has been so successful at avoiding publicity the vast majority of Scots have no idea what she even looks like. ‘I’m no Glenys Kinnock. I married Alex, not politics,’ she said. ‘I am happy to be in the background. One politician in the family is quite enough.’ Private: The SNP leader and his wife at his election in 1987. 'I am happy to be in the background,' she said . Last night, a senior politician and close friend said: ‘Moira sees herself simply as Alex’s wife, not the First Lady of Scotland. She’s very charming, very kind and has a wonderful way with everyone.’ The couple met in Edinburgh in the 1970s. She was then 24-year-old Mr Salmond’s boss in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, where he was an assistant economist. They married within three years, in 1981. When Mr Salmond was elected to Parliament in 1987, his wife, then 50, gave up her job and supported his career. As the referendum approaches, she has set up camp at their official residence, Bute House, and will quietly support her husband whichever way the vote falls.","Moira Salmond was behind the plot to unfurl flag behind PM at Wimbledon .

"By . Alison Smith-squire . When his parents built a play pirate ship in his back garden, four-year-old Joseph Bailey was thrilled. The wooden ship, crafted from recycled timber, became his pride and joy and the ‘labour of love’ was admired by everyone who saw it. But then a neighbour complained to the council that Joseph was invading their privacy, claiming he could spy on them over the fence. Scroll down for video . Four-year-old Joseph Bailey's wooden pirate ship, crafted from recycled timber, faces demolition because a neighbour complained to the council that he was invading their privacy . And despite his parents erecting a bamboo screen to solve any privacy issues, the 19ft by 8ft ship, complete with Jolly Roger, now faces demolition. Rushmoor Borough Council has ordered mum and dad Paola and Marcus to either dismantle the ship or apply for retrospective planning permission – because the structure has ‘raised platforms’ more than 12 inches (30cm) high. Last night Mr Bailey, 46, a company director, said: ‘The thought of having to dismantle Joseph’s ship is devastating. He loves it and that would break his heart.’ The couple, from Farnborough, Hampshire, began building the ship, which also incorporates a wheel, slide, dens and two sets of stairs in May. Mr Bailey said: ‘Joseph has always loved pirates and it promised to be a lovely family project – something the three of us could enjoy doing together. ‘When we told him we were going to build a ship he was so excited. It took us three-and-a-half weeks to construct and we made it up as we went along. It was a labour of love and we were so proud of it.’ But three weeks after the project was finished, they received a letter from the council. ‘The end of the garden where we built the pirate ship is surrounded by five neighbours and sadly one of them said Joseph could spy on them,’ said Mr Bailey. ‘It seemed ridiculous to be worrying about one little boy who only plays on it for a few minutes at a time, and the area is already well screened by trees.’ Joseph, with parents, Paola and Marcus, may soon be without his pirate ship after complaints from neighbours . Keen not to fall out with their neighbours, the Baileys erected a solid bamboo fence. But despite this, the council still said the ship needed full planning permission. The Baileys have since liaised with the local authority which says one way to comply with regulations would be to remove parts that are too high. But, the couple claims this would mean demolishing the wheel, slide and two sets of stairs. ‘It would ruin Joseph’s fun because it would no longer be a ship,’ Mr Bailey said. They now propose to put in the planning application, which will cost £212. Mrs Bailey, 36, said: ‘It seems ludicrous we have to pay for this application, as the council has already indicated it is likely to be refused. But we don’t know how we would tell Joseph his ship has to be dismantled. So if it is refused then we will appeal.’ A spokesman for Rushmoor Borough Council said: ‘We received a complaint about the effect on neighbours’ privacy and so were obliged to investigate.’","A neighbour complained to the council that four-year-old Joseph Bailey was invading their privacy .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . The search for missing Queenslander Peter Maynard continues on the island of Nusa Lembongan off the coast off Bali. Mr Maynard has been missing for 11 days but his family has not given up hope. The search party grew on Saturday with more surfers, expats and family joining in. His wife, Kylie flew to Bali with Mr Maynard's brother John and other relatives on Thursday. Scroll down for video . The search continues for 46-year-old Queensland man Peter Maynard who was last seen on August 27 off the coast of Nusa Lembongan island . The father of three was last seen having breakfast by hotel staff at the Nusa Indah Bungalow on August 27. It was only when he failed to check out the next day that alarm bells started ringing. Hotel staff found his possessions intact and his wallet by the bathroom sink. The Maynard family is considering hiring a helicopter to get an aerial view of the area. It is believed Mr Maynard may have gone out for a surf before going missing as one of his three surfboards was missing. Police say the conditions that day were relatively calm while local surfers contradict this. The case has baffled police, who believe if Mr Maynard did go missing in the surf, they would have found his board by now. Nusa Penida police chief Nyoman Suarsika told Nine News that private boat owners and fishermen are helping, with all told to look out for a surfboard or a person who looks lost. 'The result is still zero,' he said. Friends of Mr Maynard and his family are appealing to anyone who was in the Nusa Lembongan area and might have seen him to come forward. 'He was wearing a bright blue surf vest or rashie and dark-coloured board shorts and his surfboard is white, a Hammo brand,' his brother John Maynard said. 'We will continue to work with local police, the Australian consulate and surf and rescue authorities in the hope that together we can find Peter and bring this matter to an end.' His friends Nicholas and Katrina Thorpe are also appealing via the Facebook page Bali Expat for anyone who might have seen him or know of his whereabouts to contact them. 'If they visited Nusa Lembongan Island around the same time Peter did if they could go through photos and have a think about who they saw,' Mr Thorpe told ABC News.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Children as young as nine are taking and sharing explicit photographs of themselves according to a leading Australian cyber safety expert. Susan McLean, who works alongside the Victorian police as well as providing training for schools, told Daily Mail Australia that the problem is not only extremely common, but that it is not at all new. 'I have been dealing with this routinely,' Ms McLean said of under 18-year-olds feeling the pressure to take sexualised and naked photographs of themselves. 'There isn't a secondary school in the country that hasn't had to do with teens sending these images and even some primary schools are dealing with it.' Australian cyber safety expert, Susan McLean, revealed that students in both high schools and even primary schools feel pressured to share naked photographs of themselves with their peers . Her admission comes in the wake of the recent celebrity hacking scandal, in which dozens of women including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kirsten Dunst had their private explicit photographs hacked and shared online. However Ms Mclean revealed that she has been addressing the issue with children as young as nine since 2010. 'One of the saddest things I've addressed is during sessions in high schools where girls admit they are under pressure to send naked images to boys. 'We're not talking about just couple of 17-year-olds in new relationships, we're talking about a group of young girls who are believing it's part of the dating and flirting process. We are talking about people under 18, and this is child pornography. 'No one should have to do anything. It's not part of the dating ritual, but some young people believe this is what they have to do to get on or get ahead or be popular – to be liked, I have to behave in this way.' The admission comes in the wake of the recent celebrity hacking scandal, in which dozens of women including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton had their private explicit photographs hacked and shared online . The pressure to provide images has also occurred in more sinister ways, with some teenagers being blackmailed into providing naked photographs. Ms McLean told the Daily Telegraph that a 14-year-old girl 'sent an image as a joke but then he threatened to release it if she didn't send more so she felt it was better to keep him on side and sent naked photos for about six months, we got on the local police because it was extortion.' In 2013, Australian education departments recorded over 940 incidents of students sexually abusing their fellow students, according to the ABC, with inconsistent numbers recorded across the states being attributed to dismissals and poor data collection. In younger children, the pressures surrounding explicit photographs differed from those experienced by older age groups, however Ms McLean said the problem was still present. 'With younger kids they are considered 'fun' or 'rude' photos, they're not really sexual,' she said. In 2013, Australian education departments recorded over 940 incidents of students sexually abusing fellow students, with inconsistent numbers across states being attributed to dismissals and poor data collection . 'We know that the onset of puberty is much earlier than it ever was and in grade five and six some children have boyfriends or girlfriends in their own little way. I was called into a primary school – a top private one - where I had grade five children sharing nude photos on Instagram.' The cyber safety expert said that in an increasingly sexualised world, the approach in dealing with the problem needs to be holistic by including: teaching children web safety and making sure they know the risks associated with the devices they are using, modernising sexual education in high schools so that it addresses relationships and pressures, empowering young people to have a voice and make their own decisions as well as encouraging parents to talk to their children about awkward subjects. 'Now, children are exposed to far more sexually explicit imagery, and certainly the ability to be connected to a sexual side of life wasn't there for a young person back in the day – if you take away the hacking scandal, which is crime in itself - youngster after youngster were coming out with sex tapes. Young people see that and there's an enormous pressure to want to be like celebrities and do what everyone else is doing,' Ms McLean said.","Children as young as nine have been sharing naked photographs of themselves with their classmates .

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . It's believed Zahra, 18, is training to become a dingo handler . A Queensland dingo sanctuary has found the most unlikely of advocates to help raise much needed funds so it can continue to run. Zahra Chamberlain, the half-sister of Azaria Chamberlain – the nine-week-old baby snatched from her tent at Uluru in 1980 by a dingo, is heading a campaign to continue the conservation and protection of dingoes in Queensland. It's believed the 18 year old is also learning to be a dingo handler. The Sunday Telegraph has reported the Year 12 student, from Lake Macquarie, NSW, has been flying to Queensland to support the Durong dingo sanctuary and raise awareness. While Zahra was never part of the family tragedy, which occurred long before she was born, it has made a big mark on her life. Her father Michael Chamberlain and his then wife, Lindy, were embroiled in a long battle regarding the death of their daughter, Azaria Chamberlain. They had reported that their daughter had been taken from their tent by a dingo on the night of August 17, 1980, on a family camping trip to Uluru. However Lindy Chamberlain was tried for Azaria's murder and spent more than three years in prison, while Michael was convicted as an accessory after the fact and received a suspended sentence.

The 18 year old is the half-sister of Azaria Chamberlain – the nine-week-old baby snatched from her tent at Uluru in 1980 by a dingo. Her dad Michael Chamberlain and his then wife Lindy fought for 32 years to have their name cleared to prove a dingo was responsible for the death of their baby daughter, Azaria . She was released when a piece of Azaria's clothing was found near a dingo lair, and new inquests were opened. In 2012, some 32 years after Azaria's death, the Chamberlains' version of events were officially confirmed by a coroner. In an interview with The Sunday Mail, Zahra said she wanted to use her profile to educate people about the maligned canine. 'We’re past all that terrible negative history,' she said. 'Given my family’s past, I still love dingoes as I do any other Australian wildlife.' In 1991 Lindy and Michael Chamberlain divorced and three years later Mr Chamberlain remarried Ingrid Bergner to have Zahra in 1996.

Michael and Lindy Chamberlain (pictured) fought for 32 years to clear their names over the death of baby Azaria. In June 2012, the historic Australian case was ended and found a dingo did take Azaria from her tent in Uluru in 1980 . While Zahra never knew her half sister, the Daily Telegraph reported she was by her dad’s side in 2012 when one of the most controversial cases in Australian history ended, finding a dingo had in fact killed her sister Azaria. But the emotional milestone didn't keep her away from and loving the animal that caused her family so much pain.

Zahra said 'Biosecurity has issues regarding the number of dingoes he owns and their housing arrangements. They want him to either de-sex them, separate the sexes, or take some dingoes away and send them another zoo.' 'To solve this problem, he needs to build 5 new enclosures very quickly. We are looking at roughly $8000 plus just for materials.' So far the site has raised over $2000 and is slowly gaining more media attention. Despite his history with dingoes, Zahra says her father Michael has become supportive of her passion to help them. Earlier this year, one of the dingoes at the Durong sanctuary unexpectedly gave birth to four pups and it's believed the fourth pup was named after Zahra.","Zahra Chamberlain is raising funds for dingoes and wants to be a dingo handler .

"By . Charles Yates . A family have claimed they were gassed and robbed after parking their motorhome in a French service area – the latest in a spate of attacks on British tourists. Nick Turner, 51, his wife Joy, 52, and their children Lizzie, 20, and 14-year-old Robert were asleep in their £65,000 Swift Kon-tiki motorhome when the thieves struck in the early hours. The family only realised the break-in had occurred when they woke the next morning with sore throats and headaches – and found that about £2,000 of valuables were missing. Scroll down for video . Nick Turner, 51, (right) his wife Joy, 52, and their children Lizzie, 20, and 14-year-old Robert were asleep in their £65,000 Swift Kon-tiki motorhome when the thieves struck in the early hours . Last night, Mr Turner, a solicitor from Malvern, Worcestershire, called on the French government to act before a tourist is killed. Other British families have reported similar raids this summer, leading to the Caravan Club to issue a warning last month telling holidaymakers not to stop in French motorway service areas. However, experts in Britain have cast doubt over the use of gas by gangs of thieves. The Turners were travelling to Switzerland two weeks ago when they decided to spend the night in a well-lit rest area on the A4 motorway near Metz, a garrison town in the Lorraine region. Mr Turner said: ‘We believe the thieves pumped laughing gas in through the vents to knock us out. They then ransacked our motorhome with us inside. ‘Nobody heard them breaking in through the main door and we were out that cold that they then broke out through another door. It is still amazing to think none of us stirred or heard a sound. The Turners were travelling to Switzerland two weeks ago when they decided to spend the night in a well-lit rest area on the A4 motorway near Metz (pictured), a garrison town in the Lorraine region . The Turner family, who had stopped off near Metz in north eastern France, only realised the break-in had occurred when they woke the next morning with sore throats and headaches – and found that about £2,000 of valuables were missing . ‘All in all, about £2,000 worth of goods and cash was taken. We even had a toothbrush stolen along with an iPad and my son’s Sony PlayStation. ‘But the worst part is the intrusion and not knowing what happened. None of us had any idea it was happening and that is very frightening indeed.’ He added: ‘It was shocking to be the victim of such a crime and it can only be a matter of time before a small child is killed by these thieves as we all know gas kills.’ He also called for the French government to crack down on the crime. ‘They treated it as a very mundane crime, but having people in your motorhome gassing you should be treated much more seriously. It is only a matter of time before someone is killed either by the fumes or waking up midway through a robbery. ‘When you have tourists gassed in their sleep, it’s not a very good advert for your country.’ Jamie Chadwick, 21, and his girlfriend Janie Horsley, 17, (centre) were travelling back from Spain with his mother Linda, father Darren and two relatives when they realised they had been robbed . A gendarme at the police station in Metz said: ‘This happens all the time. It is mainly to foreign tourists or lorry drivers. We send out patrol cars – what else can we do? ‘What do the British police do? It must be happening in Britain. We suspect it’s people from Eastern Europe.’ The attack comes just weeks after the Chadwick family, from Oakwood, Derby, also had £2,000 of valuables stolen in a similar raid. Jamie Chadwick, 21, and his girlfriend Janie Horsley, 17, were travelling back from Spain with his mother Linda, father Darren and two relatives when they decided to spend the night at a service station near Bourges on the A71. The Chadwick family had £2,000 of valuables stolen in a raid at a service station near Bourges (pictured) on the A71 . Mrs Chadwick said at the time: ‘We all woke up at around 6am, with headaches and really sore throats. We then realised we had been robbed. We were all in shock – it was so awful.’ Last night, the Royal College of Anaesthetists said: ‘It would not be possible to knock someone unconscious by blowing gas through the window of a motorhome without their knowledge, even if they were sleeping.’ A report issued by the Foreign Office last week said: ‘Avoid parking in isolated areas of unsupervised camping grounds, and consider installing an alarm in your caravan or mobile home.’","Nick Turner, 51, his wife and their children were asleep when thieves struck .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Rizwan Arshad, who has been jailed for 21 years . A blind man has been jailed for 21 years after he was described as the 'mastermind' of two plots to flood the streets with more than £300,000-worth of Class A drugs. Despite his disability, Rizwan Arshad was the ringleader of an operation involving the distribution of heroin and cocaine and massive amounts of cutting agents in the Bradford and Huddersfield areas - the first in 2012 and the second while on bail last year. Arshad, 33, from Bradford, was one of six people jailed by Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC for their parts in the 'sophisticated and planned enterprise'. The judge told Arshad that his barrister had asked for a discount because of the difficulties he will face in prison through his blindness, but said: 'That has not prevented you in the past committing offences of deception, it has not prevented you achieving degree status at university and it did not prevent your role in these conspiracies. 'It is an indication of your sheer intelligence being at the heart of the essence of these matters. 'It may be incredible to the observer that someone of your undoubted disability was managing to run and managing to co-ordinate and fulfil the needs of such a conspiracy.' Police observations showed Arshad, of Lower Rushton Road, Thornbury, had a BMW which he had gained through the Motability scheme and would rely on other drivers 'and lieutenants' to help him with his activities. Huge amounts of drugs and cash were seized from the group by police, including £264,000-worth of cocaine, £50,000-worth of heroin and 33 kilograms of bulking agents. Police surveillance also revealed regular meetings in Bradford, Huddersfield and South Yorkshire. Matthew Francois, 33, left, has been jailed for 10 years and Aftab Basharat, 25, right, has been jailed for eight . 'The object was to supply in the streets of this area a mass of cocaine or heroin with the aim of enriching you, Arshad, and those around you,' said Judge Durham Hall . Detective Insp Philip Little added: 'The investigations of Arshad and his associates showed him to be the head of an established organised crime group whose criminal activities in trafficking controlled drugs and cutting agents stretched across West Yorkshire and beyond. He will now spend a lengthy period in prison.' Andrew Kershaw, prosecuting, suggested Arshad had a second home in Salford Quays. He made at least one trip to Dubai and another to Amsterdam that year while also enjoying a holiday with his wife in Mauritius. Ramunas Venckus, who has been jailed for five years . The first case occurred between January and October 2012, and culminated in caffeine, Paracetamol and benzocaine - all of which were being used as cutting agents - being seized. In July that year he was found in a taxi with £108,000 of drug contaminated notes in bundles. He was arrested and granted bail, but continued to operate while being covertly watched by police. He was seen meeting with his 'lieutenant' Aftab Basharat, 25, and 36-year-old Matthew Francois - who headed up the Huddersfield side of the operation. Arshad also played a part in a third conspiracy in Burnley. He was found guilty by a jury at Bradford Crown Court of one conspiracy to supply class A drugs and pleaded guilty to two others. Francois, from Benny Park Close, Batley, was jailed for 10 years after admitting one charge of conspiracy.
