"By . Chris Kitching . Yorkshire has been named the best travel destination in Europe for the second consecutive year thanks to its stunning countryside and coastline – and everything in between. The UK's largest county received the top gong from tourism industry professionals at the World Travel Awards in Athens, beating out the likes of Barcelona, Istanbul, London, Paris and Venice. Famed for its medieval heritage, scenic hiking trails and sandy beaches, Yorkshire's wonders are no secret to holidaymakers, registering more than 200 million visits every year. Number one: York Minster helped Yorkshire win the title of leading travel destination in Europe for 2014 . Fun in the sun: Yorkshire's tourism board says the county registers 216 million visits a year . Yorkshire's tourism industry is worth an estimated £7 billion annually and it employs almost a quarter of a million people. Travellers flock to the county because it is steeped in history and decorated with incredible landscapes, and it offers something for every visitor. One of its crown jewels is York Minster, the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe, and it is also home to six national museums, three national parks and five Michelin star restaurants. Take a hike: Yorkshire is home to many beautiful walking routes, including this one in Yorkshire Dales . Ingleton Waterfalls is one of the attractions that draws millions of visitors to Yorkshire every year . This summer, Yorkshire was propelled onto the world stage again as it hosted the first two stages of the Tour de France. More than two million fans lined the roads in cities and towns to catch a glimpse of the competitors as they raced through the region, giving another boost to the tourism industry in God's Own County. London is a 10-time winner of the award introduced in 1996 and it was the last destination to win back-to-back titles (2007 and 2008). Yorkshire was a double winner on the night as the Welcome to Yorkshire tourism agency won the award for the best marketing campaign at a ceremony hailed as 'the Oscars of the travel industry'. The ancient Acropolis of Athens edged Rome's Colosseum and Paris' Eiffel Tower as Europe's top attraction . Travel agents cast votes to crown Europe's best in more than 80 categories, ranging from the top airport hotel and leading chauffeur company to the most romantic resort and best travel club. Athens' Acropolis was named the leading tourist attraction, while the top island destination was the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira. The leading beach destination was Corfu in Greece and the top city break destination was Geneva, Switzerland. Sit back and relax: The popular tourist destination of Corfu, Greece was recognized for its glamorous beaches .

"By . Rebecca Brett . More than a third of Britons go on holiday without sufficient insurance, with the average cost to receive treatment abroad totalling £747. Treating broken bones and suffering sickness bugs are the two top complaints for the 37 per cent of these holidaymakers who have needed medical treatment while abroad. Infections, alcohol-related conditions or accidents and dehydration make up the top five most popular complaints travellers without insurance have required attention for. Broken limbs on holiday was the top reason for treatment in hospitals while on holiday (posed by model) More than 1,700 adults who had been on holiday at least once in the past year were questioned for the survey. Initially, respondents were asked ‘Have you ever travelled abroad without taking out travel insurance, for a holiday, business or any other reason?’ to which 66 per said no. The 34 per cent who indicated that they had travelled without insurance were then asked if they had ever received medical treatment while abroad, to which 63 per cent answered no. The 37 per cent, who had answered yes, were asked to provide information on the medical treatment required while they were abroad. Worth the risk? Out of 1732 Brits asked 34% travelled without insurance in last two years . Broken Limbs (67 per cent), sickness bugs (56 per cent), viral infections (34 per cent), drinking related conditions/accidents (28 per cent) and dehydration (21 per cent) make up the top five medical treatments holidaymakers without travel insurance have needed. The average cost of treatment was revealed as £747. Matthew Wood of vouchercloud.com, which carried out the survey, said: ‘I think that what this shows is a need for education in how cheap travel insurance can be, with some single-trip insurance being as low as £15. ‘Surely that is a better price to pay for the security of knowing that if you need medical assistance abroad, you aren’t going to be stung with an enormous bill and potentially ruin your trip. ‘The unexpected can happen at any time to anyone, so for the sake of an extra few pounds, it really isn’t worth the risk.’","34% of Brits travelled without insurance in past two years .

"By . Chris Kitching . Cash-strapped Air India is putting fewer passengers on its long-haul flights from Mumbai to America – and losing more money – because the type of aircraft used on that route is at risk of hitting the city’s mega-sized billboards. The gigantic signs are blocking the flight path at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, creating a significant hazard for Boeing 777-300ER aircraft that are too heavy to clear them while carrying full loads of passengers and fuel. In order to lighten the load, Air India is leaving 51 seats empty on its 16-hour, non-stop flights from Mumbai to Newark, New Jersey, Bloomberg reported. The Boeing 777-300ER cannot clear the billboards while flying with full loads of passengers and fuel . The twin-engine 777-300ER can carry a total of 365 passengers but it is flying at 15 per cent below capacity on Air India’s Mumbai-Newark route. That means the airline is losing nearly £1million per month, according to G.M. Siddeshwara, India’s junior aviation minister. The situation is adding to the woes of debt-laden Air India, which hasn’t turned a profit since 2006 and required a £2billion government bailout in 2012. To lighten the load, Air India is flying 51 fewer passengers on its Mumbai-Newark route . Towering billboards appear in clusters throughout Mumbai, selling everything from the latest Bollywood films and fashion to mobile phone deals and upcoming events. Air India complained about 15 signs near the airport but two are still standing in the way thanks to litigation, Bloomberg reported. Thirteen have been removed. The billboards are not an obstruction for United Airlines, which flies the same route using the smaller Boeing 777-200.

"By . Andrew Pierce . Farce may have descended yesterday on the Ukip ‘carnival’ in Croydon ahead of the European poll tomorrow. But if you want to see how chaotic the elections really are, consider the ballot papers that await voters on Thursday. The one for the London region includes the names of a staggering 127 candidates representing 17 different political parties. The proportional voting system of the European elections favours small parties, meaning scores of fringe groups have been set up to sabotage Farage's Ukip . In total, there are 12 Euro electoral areas in Britain. Overall, a mind-boggling 757 candidates, representing 39 parties, are vying to be chosen as Britain’s 73 MEPs. As in previous European elections there is a baffling array of fringe parties, and this year some have been formed with the  specific purpose of sabotaging Nigel Farage’s Ukip by confusing voters. Three have been set up by former Ukip members who quit the party in protest at Farage’s style of leadership. In the West Midlands, former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire – who quit the party in 2010 – has set up the We Demand a Referendum Party. Standing in the same region is the socialist dinosaur Dave Nellist, a former Labour MP who was ejected from the party in the 1990s because of links with the far-left Militant Tendency. He’s a candidate for another anti-EU party, NO2EU, which is targeting Labour supporters and trade unionists tempted by Ukip. Another NO2EU candidate is Ron Griffiths, general secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Alongside him is the daughter of rail union firebrand Bob Crow, who died recently. Natasha Hoarau says she’s standing not only in her father’s memory, but because she believes ‘the kind of socialism he worked so hard for cannot be built until we withdraw from the EU empire’. In the South East region, Ukip is being challenged by Liberty GB, also set up by a disaffected member. Farage fears that potential voters, especially older ones who might already be perplexed by the ballot paper, will see other anti-EU parties' names and wrongly vote for them instead of for Ukip . Arguably the biggest threat to Ukip is from the An Independence From Europe party which was set up last year by former Ukip MEP Mike Nattrass. Cleverly, he ensured it comes close to the top of the ballot paper (which lists parties in alphabetical order) by including the word ‘An’. This system means that the main parties – Labour, Conservative, Lib Dems – are buried further down. Farage’s Ukip is right at the bottom of the list. Not surprisingly, Farage fears that potential voters, especially older ones who might already be perplexed by the ballot paper, will see other anti-EU parties’ names and wrongly vote for them instead of for Ukip. The clutch of fringe parties are drawn to the European elections in Britain because, unlike general elections and by-elections, which use the first-past-the-post method, candidates are selected via a proportional representation system which favours smaller parties. Indeed, the way MEPs are elected is just as complicated as the ballot paper. Critics of the Euro poll also argue that the selection system is undemocratic because you can’t choose an individual candidate you want to be your MEP – only a party – and thus it cuts the important link between electors and candidates. Among those who appear to have little hope of being elected is the Roman Party founded by Jean-Louis Pascual, a Frenchman from Bordeaux who’s now a Berkshire bus driver. Then there’s candidate number six standing for the Animal Welfare Party. She is rock chick Meg Mathews, ex-wife of Oasis musician Noel Gallagher. Which says it all really.","Proportional voting system for Euro elections favours small parties .

"By . SIMON JONES . Everton have spoken to Wolfsburg about a potential move for Croatia winger Ivan Perisic. The 25-year-old is valued at £8million and Everton scouts have watched him closely in the Bundesliga and playing for his national side notably against Australia in their pre-World Cup warm-up game and Brazil on Thursday night. Perisic only joined Wolfsburg from Dortmund 18 months ago but they are looking at strengthening in other areas and will weigh up the strength of any Everton bid. Wanted: Everton are in talks with Wolfsburg over a potential move for Ivan Perisic (left) Perisic can play on the wing, as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker. He is quick, has good technique and gets goals, often spectacular, and is comfortable on the right or left. Everton have looked at promising young Heerenveen Hakim Zyech who is considerably cheaper and Barcelona's Cristian Tello but the latter seems likely to form part of the deal that will take another Croat Ivan Rakitic from Sevilla to Barcelona. Thinking: Gareth Barry is currently considering a contract offer to stay a Everton . Chairman Bill Kenwright is continuing to work on a deal for Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea but faces strong competition while Gareth Barry is deliberating over their two year contract offer with the option for a third year. West Ham retain an interest in Barry but they should also sign Cheikhou Kouyate from Anderlecht on Monday following his medical. As reported last week, Everton are in the mix for long-term target Bruno Martins Indi and have interest in his teammate Stefan de Vrij and Jeremain Lens of Dinamo Kiev. Talent: The Toffees are also keen on Holland defender Bruno Martins Indi (above) Newcastle back in for Lasogga . Newcastle have revived a deal for Hertha Berlin striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga and may get it concluded this week. The 22-year-old made it clear to his club that he was keen on a move to England after holding a meeting with Hertha Berlin’s general manager Michael Preetz last week. The belief was he would choose between staying with Hertha or going back on loan to Hamburg where he spent last season. Lasogga scored 13 goals in 20 appearances for Hamburg but he has only one year left on contract. Newcastle have been quoted £10m but Lasogga is ready to push for the move and they hope that will help drive down the price. Moving on: Free agent Bafetimbi Gomis (right) will talk to other clubs after a move to Newcastle stalled . A move for free agent Bafetimbi Gomis though has stalled and the free agent is due to talk to other clubs this week. As Newcastle look to bring in at least one player, Hatem Ben Arfa is weighing up lucrative offers to leave. The French midfielder's representatives are in advanced talks with Qatari side Lekhwiya, who are due to appoint Michael Laudrup as manager. Al Sadd also want Ben Arfa and Barcelona midfielder Xavi. As reported last week, El Arabi have already offered Xavi a three year deal worth £21million and Ben Arfa is considering offers reputedly worth £7m a year. Goodbye? Hatem Ben Arfa is weighing up lucrative moves away from Newcastle . Ayew going to move to Premier League? Jordan Ayew will be looking to impress Premier League scouts at Monday's World Cup fixture with USA. The Marseille forward hit a hat-trick as Ghana swept aside South Korea 4-0 in their final warm-up match earlier this month and that has put clubs back on his trail. The 22-year-old has been linked with Hull City and West Bromwich Albion in the past and they are among the clubs who will watch his performances for Ghana. His representative Willie McKay said: 'Jordan is playing very well and he wants to show English Premier League clubs what he can do. There's a lot of interest gathering and a move to England appeals to him.' Ayew is the son of Abedi Pele and his older brother Andre also plays for Marseille. Ambition: Ghana's Jordan Ayew is hoping for a Premier League move away from Marseille . Chamakh wants to stay . Free agent Marouane Chamakh has confirmed he wants to stay in the Premier League, even if he fails to agree a new deal at Crystal Palace. Chamakh is out of contract later this month after signing a one year deal last summer but hopes to resolve his future before July. He scored six goals last season was key in helping Palace stay up under Tony Pulis's impressive management. Chamakh, who is also represented by Willie McKay, said: 'I am out of contract and if I do not stay at Crystal Palace I want to stay in England. I love playing in the Premier League and I was really happy with how things went last season. Home: Marouane Chamakh wants to stay in the Premier League even if he can't agree a deal with Crystal Palace . 'It took me a while to settle when I . first came to England, like it does most players when they first come to . the Premier League, but I am happy when I am playing and I want to . continue doing that in the Premier League.' Inter want Mbia . Inter Milan have an interest in QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia. Talks are ongoing between Rubin Kazan and Inter over the sale of Yann M'Vila but failure to reach agreement will prompt Inter to ask about Mbia who has enjoyed an impressive season on loan at Sevilla. QPR, meanwhile, are among clubs rivalling Arsenal for Serge Aurier. The Ivory Coast right-back impressed against Japan at the weekend and Toulouse are hoping to cash in. The £7m price tag may be a little steep for Harry Redknapp's plans though. Popular: Cameroon midfielder Stephane Mbia (left) is a target for Inter Milan . Fulham sign Hutchinson . Fulham have signed Shaun Hutchinson from Motherwell. The 23-year-old is a product of the famous Wallsend Boys Club and was out of contract at Motherwell. Felix Magath has moved to sign the 6ft 2ins young centre-back after the club released Brede Hangeland. Hutchinson also had interest from Wolves and Rangers. He made his debut for Motherwell at the tender age of 17, and said: 'It was a difficult decision to leave Motherwell and I had to really think hard about it. Replaced: Brede Hangeland has been released by Fulham as Felix Magath signs Shaun Hutchinson . 'It has been a fantastic apprenticeship for me and I am very appreciative of what everyone at the club has done. The fans have also been brilliant and I want to personally thank them for their support.'However, this is a great opportunity at Fulham and I can’t wait to get started.' Fulham also had an interest in Liverpool defender Martin Kelly who is likely to be offloaded by the Anfield club. However, relegation scuppered that for Fulham with Kelly attracting Premier League interest.","Everton speak to Wolfsburg about move for Ivan Perisic .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . First Minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would not be stopped from sharing the pound with the rest of the UK if it voted for independence . A majority of English voters think an independent Scotland should not be allowed to use the pound, according to a new poll. Some 53 per cent of those questioned disagreed with the idea of Scotland continuing to use the pound if it left the UK. This is more than double the number who said an independent Scotland should be allowed to use sterling. Some 15 per cent said they neither agreed nor disagreed and nine per cent did not know. It comes as the key issue of what currency an independent Scotland would use comes under scrutiny in the run-up to the independence referendum on September 18. But a Scottish government adviser said the decision on what currency Scotland should use if it became independent was not up to England. Crawford Beveridge, chair of the Scottish Government's Fiscal Commission Working Group which considered the issue, said: ‘A currency is not something which can only ever be used by a single country and one country cannot prevent another from using it. ‘Indeed the choice of currency is determined by the laws of a country itself and, more importantly, the confidence people have in it. ‘People can choose to trade in whichever currency they wish. What is up for debate and negotiation is the form of governance for the currency. ‘And, in this regard, I remain firmly of the view that a well-designed monetary union is the best option for both Scotland and the UK post-independence.’ Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have all ruled out entering into a currency union with an independent Scotland. Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: ‘A currency union would not happen if we left the UK. ‘That's why we need to know Alex Salmond's plan B for what would replace the pound. Would we rush to adopt the euro? Or would we set up a separate unproven currency? But Scotland’s Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a separate poll showed 71 per cent of people in Scotland agreed that the ‘pound belongs to Scotland as much as it belongs to the rest of the UK’. Ms Sturgeon said that research, which was commissioned by Yes Scotland, ‘shows that the No campaign is increasingly out of touch with Scottish opinion on the pound’. She added: ‘The people of Scotland overwhelmingly believe, by a margin of nearly four to one, that the pound would belong to an independent Scotland every bit as much as the rest of the UK. And they are right, because the pound is Scotland's currency too.’ More than half of English voters do not want an independent Scotland to be allowed to share the pound . Scots will have to pay extra to watch  BBC TV and radio shows if they vote for independence, a former director-general of the Corporation has warned. Lord Birt attacked as ‘make-believe’ Alex Salmond’s claim that the BBC would provide all its programmes for free in return for the shows produced by the First Minister’s proposed new Scottish Broadcasting Service. Instead he said the BBC would be under an obligation to licence fee payers in the remainder of the UK to get the best possible price for its shows when they were sold to a separate Scotland. He said the SBS would only have a programming budget around a tenth the size of the BBC’s and would have to tailor its schedule to its ‘modest means’. This would mean it would have to decide which BBC programmes it could afford to buy. The net result would be Scottish viewers having to pay to watch or listen to BBC programmes not purchased by their new state broadcaster, he said. The Department for Work and Pensions meanwhile has defended a memo sent to staff telling them they had to support the UK Government in its objective to maintain the union. The message, written by the DWP's top civil servant Robert Devereux, was criticised for being ‘ill judged’ amid concerns it could be seen as telling staff in Scotland how to vote in next month's independence referendum. But the DWP insisted the memo was simply intended to set out for staff the restrictions of the purdah period in the run-up to the September 18 ballot. The BBC reported the email said: ‘It is important that, as civil servants, we understand why the Scottish independence referendum is different from elections such as a UK general election or a European election. ‘This is because the UK Government has a clear position to maintain the union and so it is legitimate and necessary for UK civil servants to support the Government in this objective.’ Dave Penman, general secretary of senior civil servants' union the FDA, said the memo was ‘ill judged’ and added: ‘It is factually accurate but it probably could have been written a lot more sensitively.’ A DWP spokesman said: ‘Of course the department has not told its staff, or anyone else, how to vote. ‘It was an open letter to all DWP staff setting out Scottish referendum guidance and the role of the civil service. Similar advice has been issued by the Scottish Government.’","Some 53% of English voters reject shared currency with separate Scotland .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A man died after collapsing in a flat as a paramedic waited outside because she didn't think it was to safe to enter the property alone. Anthony Offord, 35, collapsed shortly arriving at his friend's home in Sheffield in April last year and began 'coughing' on the floor. A Yorkshire Ambulance Service paramedic arrived at the scene five minutes later, but waited outside the building for 20 minutes until other paramedics arrived. Anthony Offord died after a paramedic waited 20 minutes to give him care as she did not feel safe entering the property alone . Sheffield Coroner's Court heard how Anna Bawden was sent to the flat after a 999 call was placed at around 11pm. The paramedic arrived moments later, but remained in her response car as it was late at night and she could hear 'shouting and agitated' men inside. When she phoned dispatch for support, she was told she would have to wait 16 minutes for a double crew ambulance. It arrived at around 11.20pm, and took Mr Offord to hospital where he died days later of lack of oxygen to the brain. One ambulance crew drove past the scene at 11pm, but did not attend the emergency as staff were on their meal break, the inquest heard. Coroner Chris Dorries said it was 'more likely than not' the man would have survived if he'd been given treatment sooner. Recording a narrative verdict, he said: 'I do find it more likely than not that Mr Offord would have survived if given attention at or about 23.06. 'An ambulance had been called at the time but the lone responder attending felt the need to stand off until support was available on the grounds of personal safety. The paramedic waited for a Yorkshire Ambulance Service double ambulance crew to arrive at the scene (file image) 'The double crewed vehicle nominated to back up the lone responder was some distance away. 'There was a failure to consider other methods of support for the lone paramedic during that period.' He added he would send a report to the Health Secretary, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives and NHS England in a bid to prevent the same tragedy happening again. Mr Offord had been living at a halfway house in Sheffield after suffering mental health problems at the time of his death. After struggling to cope with the recent death of his father, he began drinking and had taken heroin on the night of his death. He died as a result of hypoxic brain injury due to mixed drug toxicity. Yorkshire Ambulance Service was 'under resourced' at the time of his death, it was heard. When Ms Bawden was sent to the address alone, she took the 'stand off' decision for the second time in her 12-year career. The paramedic felt uncertain about entering the property alone so late at night, and was put off by 'agitated' and 'shouting' male voices, the inquest heard. Call logs show another lone paramedic and a double crew ambulance could have arrived at the scene within minutes  if they had been diverted from less urgent calls. One double ambulance crew was free at 11pm, but told to return to the station as staff were on a meal break. It 'must' have passed Mr Offord and the waiting paramedic on its route, Mr Dorries added. Describing the night in question, Shaun White, who phoned the ambulance, said it seemed like a 'lifetime' for one to arrive. Toxicologist Dr Stephen Morley said he could not say if an ambulance had arrived earlier that Mr Offord would have survived but that 'the earlier an intervention was started the higher the probability of survival.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Offord's brother said: 'Once the 999 call was made there was an ambulance delay which has significantly contributed towards Anthony’s death. 'What we would like now is an apology from YAS which of course is something my brother will never get. 'We also intend to seek further legal advice as the family want to see a detailed timeline of what changes are going to be put in place and to know who will be responsible for implementing changes to YAS’s systems and procedures so this doesn't happen again.' A spokesman for Yorkshire Ambulance Service said: 'Our thoughts are with Mr Offord’s family and friends following his untimely death in April last year.' 'The Trust has fully contributed to this inquest and the Coroner was satisfied that the Trust has already addressed or is addressing the issues arising from this incident.'","Yorkshire Ambulance Service paramedic waited outside for 20 minutes .

Turning her life around: Rosie Essex, 17, was tormented so severely about the way she looked but now she's beat her anorexia and become a beauty queen as a result . Illness: Rosie's weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half-stone when she was 13-years-old . Healthy: After years of suffering with her weight, Rosie is now a healthy size eight and is finally happy with her life and the way she looks . Rosie said: 'I struggled to eat as my self-esteem had become so low, I just wanted to be accepted. 'It . feels so amazing to now have the confidence to enter beauty pageants. 'It’s a long life dream that I never thought would come true.' Rosie’s . bullies made her believe she was overweight and after three years of . allowing her eating disorder to rule her life, Rosie finally beat her . illness and found the confidence to enter her first beauty pageant. She . said: 'It was such an amazing feeling being on stage and being . surrounded by other girls who finally accepted me for who I am. 'I entered Miss Teen Great Britain 2014 and was in the top five and plan to enter again this year. 'The . pageant really helped me to believe in myself and be the person that I . want to be. 'I’m really outgoing and bubbly now which is so refreshing. 'I no longer feel like I have to hide away.' Beauty queen: Rosie finally beat her illness and found the confidence to enter her first beauty pageant and thanks to the huge boost from the beauty pageants, performing arts and dancing Rosie has excelled . Support system: Rosie says her mother has been her rock throughout everything. ' I really don't think I could've beat this awful disease without her,' she said .

Battle: Bullies targeted Rosie, pictured during her illness, for the puppy fat she had as a youngster, tormenting her and causing her to cry every day . Recalling how cruel the other children at school were, Rosie said: 'I’d be laughed at and called names like Trevor the bulldog. 'I had puppy fat when I was younger and I was timid so I guess I was easy prey for people. 'I remember when I started secondary school the bullying became so intense I would cry every single day. 'Once, some girls took my school uniform during our P.E. lesson and put it under the showers so it was soaking wet. 'I had to walk around for the rest of the day in my P.E. kit whilst everyone laughed and told me how fat I looked.' Rosie spent every day thinking of ways to change her appearance - she hated everything about the way she looked. So she began starving herself and putting on make-up to please her peers. She said: 'I . just wanted to be someone that no-one would pick on so I would starve . myself for days. 'When I was 14 I had a long-term relationship, I guess I felt accepted so I allowed myself to eat healthily again. 'When we broke up though I didn’t feel good enough. I relapsed as I wanted to punish myself.' Rosie . has since beat her eating disorder and is picking up lead positions in . musical theatre, modelling and singing, as well as taking part in beauty . pageants. Now and then: Rosie, pictured, right, during her illness, and, left, now she has got her life back on track and feels much happier with herself .

'I’ve met so many amazing people, I've completely changed my life and have a new open perspective of things. 'I’m so proud of myself and what I’ve accomplished in the last few years. I’ve won various awards for placing second or first in singing acting and dancing competitions, which I’m particularly proud of.' Thanks to the huge boost from the beauty pageants, performing arts and dancing Rosie has excelled in the last year. Rosie said: . 'Even though I was so weak from starving myself and I still went to . every dance class because my drive for success is so powerful. 'I was willing to do anything to rise above all the taunts and become an inspiration to other young women. 'My mum has been my rock throughout everything, I really don’t think I could’ve beat this awful disease without her. 'I’m really looking forward to entering Miss Teen Great Britain again next month. Success: Since getting better, she has won various awards for placing second or first in singing acting and dancing competitions, which she's particularly proud of . Proud: Rosie's mother said: 'She really has beat the bullies, it makes me so happy to see her smiling on that stage' 'I’m such a positive person now and I hope other girls who are being bullied like I was can see past it all. 'My advice would be to try your hardest to not let other people get you down. 'Every girl is beautiful in her own right, it seems like there’s no other choice but please just speak to someone about the way you’re feeling. 'Us girls go through changes every day, don’t let the present tarnish your bright future, because my mum always told me that after a rainstorm there is always a rainbow ahead. 'I don’t want anyone to lose three years of their life like I did.' Rosie’s . mother Mariette, 51, said: 'One day Rosie came home covered in cuts and . bruises that’s when I decided to move her to a different school.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . Julie Matthews, 48, failed to tell the . DWP and local council that her husband . had moved back in with her . A mother-of-three who falsely claimed more than £17,000 in benefits did not declare she was married because her husband was gay and so she did not consider them a couple. Julie Matthews, 48, from Wombwell, near Barnsley, was given a 20-week jail term suspended for a year after she admitted dishonestly receiving £17,541 in benefits. Barnsley Magistrates’ Court heard Matthews and her husband Ian married in 2003 but had not lived together ‘for a significant period of time’, before he moved back home in 2011. But she failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions and Barnsley council of the change in her circumstances, the court was told. When confronted by benefits investigators, Matthews said her husband stayed with her ‘now and again’ and she had failed to declare she was married. At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Jayne Ormrod said how Matthews did not consider them to be a couple because Mr Matthews was gay. Matthews, a mother-of-three and grandmother-of-five, admitted falsely claiming Jobseekers’ Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, housing and council tax benefits and two social fund loans. The prosecution said: 'On one occasion she said she lived alone, was not working and had no other finances. On another occasion she said she was too ill to work. 'She later said she should have declared to the Department of Work and Pensions and the council that she was living with her husband and that there had been a change in her circumstances.' Matthews' solicitor Morgan Hogarth said . that before 2011 her husband had not been living with her, but he had . moved back because she had problems with the neighbours and was . 'frightened'. Mr Hogarth said the money she received . went on day-to-day living expenses and any extra helped to fund her . daughter, who was setting up home with two young children. Matthews was given a 20-week jail term suspended for 12 months at Barnsley Magistrates' Court (pictured). She was also ordered to carry out community work and given a night-time curfew . He said Matthews had three children from her first relationship which ended when she was 23 and she was also a grandmother of five. She was the regular carer for four of the grandchildren and had also been lined up to care for a niece. Her father was terminally ill with cancer and she would miss his last few months if she was jailed, he said. Matthews, whose husband was in court to support her, was given a 20-week jail term suspended for 12 months. She was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid community work, a specified activity for 15 days working with female offenders and was given a night-time curfew, . She will re-pay the money she owed at a rate of £19 a week, by starting a new job as a cleaner this weekend. Matthews declined to comment when she left Barnsley Magistrates' Court.","Julie Matthews, 48, from Wombwell, near Barnsley was given a 20-week suspended jail term .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . By the time Joey Ziadi was eight weeks old he had already suffered complete heart failure. The tiny newborn was diagnosed with an extremely rare condition, which prevents his body from producing red blood cells. Diamond Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) affects just 800 people across the world - 125 in the UK. Little Joey's only hope to prevent long-term damage is a bone marrow transplant, but until then the toddler has to face blood transfusions every three weeks. One-year-old Joey Ziadi was diagnosed with the extremely rare Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, which prevents his body from producing red blood cells, which supply the organs with oxygen . Little Joey, pictured with his mother Kaisha Morris, faces blood transfusions every three weeks, to ensure his body gets the oxygen it requires to survive . The procedure ensures oxygen can get to Joey's vital organs, as his body is unable to perform the vital function. His mother Kaisha Morris, from Northampton, said the regular transfusions are keeping her son alive. The 35-year-old, said: 'It’s difficult having to take him for transfusions every week because it must be so uncomfortable for him. 'They’re an absolute life-saver for him though. 'Before his first one when he was eight-weeks-old he hadn’t ever opened his eyes or smiled before. 'He was just this floppy, lethargic little boy.' DBA means Joey suffers a lack of red blood cells, and as a result no oxygen reaches his organs. The condition has left the one-year-old almost blind as his optic nerves received no stimulation. As a newborn he was so weak and exhausted he couldn't even cry for food, leaving his mother to set alarms to remind her to feed him. Doctors were unable to diagnose Joey with DBA until a haematology consultant ran blood tests at eight weeks, leading to two transfusions in two days. Ms Morris said: 'It meant the world to me just to see him smile. 'Before the transfusions everything in his body had shut down but the oxygenated blood finally breathed some life into him. Joey was diagnosed with the condition, which affects 125 people in the UK and 800 across the world, when he was eight weeks old . His mother Ms Mills and father Andrew Ziadi have been told the transfusions are only a short-term answer to his condition. Joey needs a bone marrow transplant if he is to avoid long-term damage . Joey's parents are urging people to sign the Anthony Nolan donation register after no one in their family was found to be a match for their son . 'Before that I was so desperate I almost screamed “someone look at my baby"".' Even after his first transfusions, Ms Morris and Joey's father Andrew Ziadi, 34, had to wait an agonising four months before doctors could formally diagnose their son's condition. Diamond Blackfan Anaemia is a rare blood disorder, characterised by the failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. That failure causes patients to become severely anaemic. Most sufferers are diagnosed in the first year of life and can live long and healthy lives if they receive appropriate medical treatment. The most common forms of treatment are blood transfusions and in some cases stem cell transplants, or bone marrow transplants are required. Source: Diamond Blackfan Anaemia Foundation . The couple have been told the transfusions are only a short-term option, with doctors concerned Joey will suffer complete bone marrow failure. No family members have been found to be a match for Joey, prompting his parents to turn to the charity Anthony Nolan for help. Ms Morris, said: 'After all that we’ve been through, when I found out Joey needed a bone marrow transplant I just thought he’s come this far, at least we’ve got hope of a match. 'Transfusions will only ever be a short-term fix and his only hope of a long term cure is a transplant. 'We live in uncertainty, never quite knowing what the next blood test will show, and we’ve been told there’s a risk it could turn into leukaemia.' Ann O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said: 'Joey’s story highlights how much we rely on the remarkable people who pledge to save a life by donating their stem cells. 'We urgently need more young men to sign up as they are the most likely to be chosen to donate but are under-represented on the register.'

When activated, a call is made . to the wearer's own mobile phone, allowing her to have an excuse to . walk away from the harasser in a shared space such as an office or a bar. Available worldwide, it is suitable for workplaces, social . settings or even more potentially threatening situations. If the wearer is particularity worried about their safety, they . can hold the button for three seconds to send an SOS text message to a . designated number, such as parents or a friend, to notify them of danger.

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . As a ticket inspector Dean Shulton, pictured outside court, was expected to travel all over the network, hop on and off tube trains . A London Underground ticket inspector stole more than £90,000 in benefits over 18 years by claiming he could barely walk. Dean Shulton, 48, from Streatham, south London, was employed by Transport For London throughout the period, during which he claimed he was paid at the highest rate in mobility and care allowances. As a ticket inspector he was expected to travel all over the network, hop on and off tube trains - and was even licensed to descend on to the tracks in an emergency. He first applied for disability living allowance on August 16 1994, stating . that he could not walk 100 yards without becoming 'tired and breathless' and was prone to chest infections and suffered depression. Prosecutor Miss Tamsin Ryder told the court: 'He said he constantly felt tired, was . unable to walk, was very weak when trying to prepare food, he became . tired when attempting to get dressed and said his legs felt like they . weighed ten tons.' A doctor approved the application and . Shulton was awarded the highest rate of mobility benefit and the middle . rate of care benefit, which he successfully appealed and began receiving . the maximum for both. Miss Ryder continued: 'This award meant he was virtually unable to walk. 'He said he could not get out of bed, needed help to go to the toilet and needed massages to get the feeling in his legs."" Shulton also said he needed a paid carer to help turn him in his bed at night. Shulton pleaded guilty to obtaining . property by deception from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) between June 8, 1995 and January 29, last year, namely Disability Living . Allowance (DLA) totalling £93,485.35. He was sentenced to 40 weeks in . jail at Inner London Crown Court on Friday. Judge Michael Wood QC said: 'This is a really serious class of offence because of the extended period of time. 'This has been going on year after year, claiming benefit on the basis of not being able to work while holding down a job.' The fraudulent claims came to light when the DWP received intelligence that Shulton had been a revenue control inspector since the early 1990s. Investigators are thought to have questioned him shortly before January 2013. Miss Ryder explained that this meant he had powers of prosecution on the trains and held a 'Safety Critical Licence' which assessed his mobility for the job. London Underground were concerned about the number of sick days Shulton was taking and a doctor examined him on June 8, 1995. Miss Ryder said that after that examination he was deemed fit for duty and the doctor found him to be extremely well. Shulton's lawyer said that her client did not effectively travel and check tickets and was instead based at Oval tube station, pictured, where he checked tickets at the barrier . When questioned by investigators from the Department of Work and Pensions, Shulton admitted he should not have been working. Miss Ryder said: 'His discussed his illnesses and disabilities, but admitted he should not have been working and his condition had improved. Shulton has sold his house, moved in with his parents, and promised to pay compensation in full within seven days. He . remains an employee of Transport for London, but is currently the . subject of disciplinary proceedings, which he expects will end his . career. His . lawyer Miss Joanne Cecil said: 'He spent considerable time on paperwork . and administration and essentially had a desk-bound office job. Shulton was sentenced to 40 weeks in jail at Inner London Crown Court, pictured, on Friday. He admitted to falsely claiming more than £90,000 in disability living allowance from August 1994 to January last year . 'He did not effectively travel and check tickets and was based at Oval, where he checked tickets at the barrier. 'This claim was not fraudulent from the outset and even though his condition improved he could not be considered to be a well person.' Judge Wood added: 'The dishonesty is to continue to get these benefits that were plainly for someone unable to work and he was in work. He added: 'I accept you did suffer from significant disability and your symptoms did fluctuate. You behaved with tremendous realism once you were caught.' A Transport For London spokesperson said: 'We take issues of this nature extremely seriously, disciplinary proceedings are taking place.'","Dean Shulton first applied for disability living allowance in 1994 .

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Sunderland have still not given up hope on signing Fabio Borini – despite waiting five weeks for an answer from the Liverpool forward. The Black Cats tabled a £14million bid for their former loanee in mid-July and the offer was duly accepted by the Reds. Borini, however, is still to decide on where his future lies and Sunderland have yet to sign a striker this summer. Decision time: Borini has still not chosen whether he will join Sunderland despite a bid being accepted . Waiting game: For now Borini continues to train with Liverpool but seems unlikely to stay at Anfield . Boss Gus Poyet, however, is prepared to wait for the Italian, despite a reported deadline of last Monday. ‘We’re still going and we’re still trying,’ he said. ‘Nothing has changed, for good or for bad.’ Sportsmail understands Borini is weighing up his options before giving Poyet an answer, and another loan move could yet emerge as a possibility. Meanwhile, Sunderland take on Manchester United on Sunday at the Stadium of Light. Strike: Lee Cattermole will keep his place against Manchester United after a stunning goal last week . Joy: Cattermole's fine performances are keeping January signing Liam Bridcutt out of the Sunderland side . Lee Cattermole – scorer of a stunning goal during last week’s 2-2 draw with West Brom – will again anchor the midfield in place of January signing Liam Bridcutt, and Poyet added: ‘Lee is an example of how football works. When I bought Liam everyone thought he would be first choice. ‘But Liam isn’t playing because of himself, it’s because of Lee Cattermole and the form he is in.

"By . James Tozer for the Daily Mail . and Martin Robinson for MailOnline . They are not locations which normally feature in lists of the best places in Britain to live. But a garrison town near Salisbury Plain, a bracing Cumbrian seaside village, a Glasgow suburb and an Anglesey village have been hailed among the country’s most desirable postcode areas in a report for Royal Mail. Commissioned to mark the 40th anniversary of the roll-out of postcodes to every UK address, the study analyses each location by factors including job opportunities, housing affordability, health levels and crime rates. England: The Wiltshire town of Tidworth, which is previously best-known as the birthplace of singer James Blunt and home of a polo club whose Patron is the Prince of Wales has topped a survey of the most desirable postcodes to live in . Scotland: Holmwood House, designed by celebrated architect Alexander Thomson, is in the G44 postcode - considered the best place in the country to live by Royal Mail . Wales: The rural idyll of Brynteg - which has a LL78 postcode - has been ranked the best place in Wales to live . Number one in England is SP9 covering the Wiltshire town of Tidworth, previously best-known as the birthplace of singer James Blunt and home of a polo club whose Patron is the Prince of Wales. A thriving Army community among its 10,000-strong population, low crime rates and good transport links all helped it defeat the posh London suburbs and genteel market towns normally ranked among the best places to live but out of reach to many average earners. Even the town’s mayor yesterday admitted the accolade would come as a shock to many people. ‘Outside Wiltshire, I think most people will say “Tidworth? Where’s Tidworth? I’ ve never heard of Tidworth”,’ said Christopher Franklin MBE, himself a former soldier who stayed put after leaving the Army. ‘Local people will probably be surprised too, but when they think about our location, plus the fact this is an affordable place to live with a very low crime rate, the reasons will become more apparent to them. ‘Hopefully this won’t just put Tidworth on the map, but it will also highlight the importance of it remaining a town with a garrison, rather than becoming a garrison with a town.’ Runner up: Yateley in Hampshire has been named as the second most desirable place to live in England . The Erskine Bridge taken from Old Kilpatrick, one of the main road crossings spanning the Clyde - an area considered the second best place to live in Scotland . By the sea: Llantwit Major in the Vale of Glamorgan - which sits on the heritage coastline of Wales came in second in the country . In second place in England was GU46 . covering Yateley in Hampshire, a small town off the M3 less than 50 . miles from Tidworth whose previous claims to fame include housing the . former headquarters of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. Its . quality of life has been recognised before – the local district was . ranked top throughout the entire UK by Halifax Bank in 2011, . highlighting high employment, good health and low crime. Third place went to CA27, better-known . as the small seaside village of St Bees, one of three Cumbrian . communities to make the top ten, making it the best-represented county. The . site of a Norman priory and a 400-year-old private school whose . ex-pupils include Mr Bean actor Rowan Atkinson, it remains popular for . beach holidays despite its somewhat bleak location, while having high . employment thanks to the proximity of the Sellafield nuclear . reprocessing site. In Scotland the top postcode is G44, which is the Cathcart area in the south side of Glasgow. The . area includes Cathcart Cemetery, the burial place of actress Madge . Metcalfe, the mother of Stan Laurel, one half of the famous comedy duo . Laurel and Hardy.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . A new entrepreneurial duo with a taste for the 'zen' approach want to help men and women dress like 'everyday billionaires' by selling them nothing by black V-necked shirts. BlackV Club will launch in the next few weeks and is the brainchild of University of Pennsylvania graduates Edward Lando, 22, and Yagil Burowski, 25; who argue that the smartest, wealthiest cats around don't have the time or mental effort to be clad in anything but black. 'People we look up to, from President Obama to Mark Zuckerberg, wear the same kind of clothes every day to have one less thing to think about,' the founders tell MailOnline. 'Looking good shouldn’t be time-consuming and frustrating. It should be an effortless, delightful experience.' The shade of success? BlackV Club hasn't yet released any visuals other than its logo (left) but plans to sell a 'billionaire's uniform' of five identical black V-neck t-shirts, perfect for the 'too rich to care' set . 'You can have any shirt you want, as long as it's a black V-neck,' the aptly minimalist website reads. Mr Lando and Mr Burowski both claim to wear black V-necks 'more than usual' these days. 'People we look up to, from President Obama to Mark Zuckerberg, wear the same kind of clothes every day' Although they haven't quite settled on which brand to debut with yet, they say the style will be short sleeved, unisex, and in the 'affordable luxury' price bracket.

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . French president Francois Hollande has led the tributes to allied forces who helped to liberate France's Mediterranean coastline 70 years ago today. The so-called southern landings during the Second World War, saw a total 450,000 troops and 881 warships land on the beaches of Provence to liberate the towns and cities including Toulon, Marseilles and eventually Cannes. The landings came just 10 weeks after the D-Day invasion of Normandy and helped to squeeze the Nazi occupiers in the country, hastening the German defeat and the end of the conflict. Francois Hollande unveils a memorial plaque paying tribute to the forces who helped liberate southern France during World War II . Mr Hollande arrives with French officials to a ceremony to pay tribute to those who took part in the Southern Landings . Troops including those from the U.S. and former French colonies in Africa took part in the invasion, code named Operation Dragoon and all took part in today's anniversary memorial in Toulon, where Mr Hollande unveiled a memorial plaque. Twenty warships, including the USS Mount Whitney, two British minesweepers, and ships from Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco today joined a naval parade off the beaches of Provence. A special homage was also paid to the tens of thousands African troops recruited by colonisers to fight the Nazis. Fifteen African leaders, some of whom have strained relations with the former colonial power, were invited to Friday's events. In a speech, Mr Hollande said: 'France ... is a nation that takes its responsibility to assure the security of Europe but also security in the world, and to act wherever we are asked to act for peace.'

Dillard points his rifle in the French Alps after participating in the invasion in southern France, which led to the liberation of the country . On the evening of August 15, 1944, some 100,000 men landed on the beaches of southern France. Initially it was planned that the landings would co-incide with those in the north of the country but a lack of landing craft meant it was postponed. Ten weeks later, troops from the U.S. and the African colonies landed on Alpha and Delta beaches after French resistance fighters damaged communication and transport networks. Many of the German troops, made up from German-occupied teritories quickly surrendered and the allied forces then went on to capture Camel beach. As more and more allied troops arrived on the beaches the Germans began to withdraw and three days later, Digne was liberated closely followed by Grenoble. In his speech, Mr Hollande  said: 'France ... is a nation that takes its responsibility to assure the security of Europe but also security in the world, and to act wherever we are asked to act for peace . The French president had earlier arrived in Toulon for the unveiling ceremony on a Super Puma helicopter . The American forces then pushed northwards while battles raged to take back the cities of Toulon and Marseilles and they were both liberated on August 27, 1944. Allied troops then continued to push northwards as the Germans were unable to dislodge them. Two weeks later Montélimar and Lyon were liberated and by September 20, ports in Marseille and Toulon were re-opened again to shipping. A total of 7,000 Allied troops were killed and 10,000 were wounded during the operation. A ceremony dedicated to U.S. troops will take place at the American cemetery of Draguignan on Saturday. Today's celebrations come just weeks after the 70th anniversary of D-Day where world leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and the Queen attended a ceremony in Northern France.","Francois Hollande unveiled plaque to commemorate efforts of allied troops .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Associated  Press Reporter . The family of a mentally ill Colorado prison inmate who died while in custody have filed a lawsuit alleging guards ignored his urgent medical needs. A lawsuit filed Thursday claimed that at least 16 state prison staff members did nothing to help as Christopher Lopez suffered seizures and died at the San Carlos prison in March 2013. The lawsuit said that when guards found Lopez unresponsive on his cell floor, they treated it as a behavioral problem instead of a medical emergency and put him in chains and shackles. Warning: Graphic content . Lawsuit: The family of Christopher Lopez are suing after the mentally ill patient died after being shackled and left while having a seizure . Seizure: Lopez had been found unresponsive and barely conscious in his cell in March last year . The family said that 35-year-old had bipolar schizoaffective disorder, but instead of calling for medical help when he had a fit, the guards allegedly put Lopez in chains and with a hood over his head. Lopez later died after suffering two large seizures in the early hours of March 17, last year. 'The guards, who viewed his . unresponsiveness as a behavioral problem, followed a special controls . policy, that resulted in his being shackled to a chair with a belly . chain around his waist, and a spit mask over his head,'  according to the . lawsuit filed Thursday. According to the lawsuit, which is being brought by the inmate's mother, Juanita Lopez, and three minor children, the incident was caught on security cameras inside the prison. Civil rights lawyer David Lane, who is . handling the case, told the Denver Post the video of the incident was . 'horrific to watch'. After . finding Lopez unresponsive and barely conscious in his cell at 3.30am, . guards shackled him to a chair and put a mesh spit mask over his head, . the lawsuit states. Guards handcuffed Lopez and put a mesh spit hood over his head after finding him unresponsive in his cell . Claims: The lawsuit alleges that guards failed to seek medical help for Lopez . Eventually, it added, Lopez was unchained but staff allegedly ignored him as he suffered two seizures and died on the concrete floor. 'We have a ringside seat to watch Mr. Lopez suffer two grand mal seizures in front of the camera while the Defendants idly stand about and discuss their views about Wal-Mart and other equally important topics, laughing and joking with one another, all the while completely ignoring the dying man in their charge,' the lawsuit stated. It alleged that no one moved to help Lopez as he struggled to breathe from the floor of a cell before dying there a couple of hours later. According to 9 News, staff only noticed he had died when someone went to the cell to move the inmate and was unable to find a pulse. A coroner ruled that the cause of death was natural, and said a sodium deficiency could have been to blame. Upsetting: Footage from security cameras in the prison show Lopez slumped in the chair he was chained to . Adrienne . Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, said that the . agency did not condone the actions of the employees involved. She said that three staff members were fired and five were reprimanded within ten days of the incident. Lopez, who struggled with mental health issues, had been in prison on several occasions since 1996, and was due to spend several months in solitary confinement at a facility that housed mentally ill prisoners at the time of his death.","Christopher Lopez was put in chains after being found unresponsive .

"By . Richard Shears . A tragedy was unfolding in the Indian Ocean today as searchers found 13 bodies, with another 50 people missing from a sunken asylum-seeker boat. The group had been sailing from Indonesia to Christmas Island, which is in Australian territory, when their leaky fishing vessel came to grief. Its upturned hull, surrounded by debris, was found - before several of the bodies were located. Many asylum seekers hope for a better life in Australia and surrounding territories - sometimes with devastating consequences. This boat was driven on to the rocks surrounding Christmas Island in December 2010 . While most of those on board were men, the passengers who had set out looking for a new life in Australia included women and children. 'This is another terrible tragedy - another terrible reminder how dangerous these journeys are,' said Australia's Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare. He said in Canberra today that at least 55 people had been seen by a border patrol aircraft on the deck of the vessel last Wednesday, some 28 miles north west of Christmas Island. Opposition border protection spokesman Michael Keenan repeated Mr Clare's view, telling Sky News today: 'This is another terrible human tragedy.' A navy ship, HMAS Warramunga was sent to the area until the boat's submerged hull was spotted by an Air Force plane some 65 miles north west of Christmas Island. What has been described as a 'debris field' - including lifejackets - was found. At least 27 people died when this boat was smashed against rocks by the waves off of Christmas Island in 2010 . Then as night fell, a body was seen from the air, but the crew of the naval ship were unable to find it. With two merchant vessels answering the call for assistance, nine bodies were found on Saturday and by today a total of 13 bodies had been located, but none had yet been recovered from the water. Mr Clare said that when the vessel was first spotted on Wednesday it did not appear to be in distress. But whenever asylum seeker boats are located, naval vessels are sent out to escort them to Christmas Island where the passengers - mostly from Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka - are questioned about their backgrounds. On this occasion, the navy ship was unable to locate the boat and the search for more bodies was continuing throughout today. Meanwhile a distress call has been received by a second boat some 110 miles north of Christmas Island. Aircraft and rescue vessels were heading to the area. The asylum seeker debate - sparked by the Labour Government's 'open door' policy in contrast to the tough stance of the previous Liberal government of John Howard - has made Prime Minister Julia Gillard unpopular among many Australians. Tens of thousands have reached Australian territory since the Labour government came to power in 2007 - since the beginning of 2013 more than 11,300 asylum seekers have reached Australia, 660 arriving in the first week of June alone. The asylum seeker controversy is expected to be a major issue in the September general election. Opinion polls indicate that Labour is heading for a landslide defeat.","Leaky fishing boat was sailing from Indonesia to Christmas Island .

"By . Mark Prigg . US Navy bosses have revealed futuristic plans to beam power from space. They believe large arrays of space solar modules could send solar power to Earth. The radical scheme could be used to power military installations and even cities. One concept under consideration uses reflectors to concentrate sunlight, and a satellite beams power to a receiver from orbit. The scheme uses a 'sandwich' module, which packs all the electrical components between two square panels. The top side is a photovoltaic panel that absorbs the Sun’s rays. An electronics system in the middle converts the energy to a radio frequency, and the bottom is an antenna that transfers the power toward a target on the ground. The modules would be assembled in space by robots to form a one kilometer, very powerful satellite. Dr. Paul Jaffe, a spacecraft engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, has built and tested two types of module to capture and transmit solar power. The scheme uses a 'sandwich' module, which packs all the electrical components between two square panels. The top side is a photovoltaic panel that absorbs the Sun’s rays. An electronics system in the middle converts the energy to a radio frequency, and the bottom is an antenna that transfers the power toward a target on the ground. The modules would be assembled in space by robots to form a one kilometer, very powerful satellite. A second design, a 'step' module, modifies the sandwich design by opening it up, which allows it to receive more sunlight without overheating, thereby making it more efficient. Even the Navy admits the plan sounds like a sci-fi plot. 'It's hard to tell if it's nuts until you've actually tried,' he said. 'Launching mass into space is very expensive,' says Jaffe, so finding a way to keep the components light is an essential part of his design. His sandwich module is four times more efficient than anything made previously. The step module design, now in the patent process, opens up the sandwich to look more like a zig-zag. This allows heat to radiate more efficiently, so the module can receive greater concentrations of sunlight without overheating. He also has a novel approach to solving the thermal problem, using the 'step' module. The step module design, now in the patent process, opens up the sandwich to look more like a zig-zag. This allows heat to radiate more efficiently, so the module can receive greater concentrations of sunlight without overheating. Compared to sandwich modules built previously for space solar power, Dr. Paul Jaffe says NRL's was ""more than four times as efficient. 'One of our key, unprecedented contributions has been testing under space-like conditions,' said Jaffe. Using a specialized vacuum chamber at another facility would have been too expensive, so Jaffe built one himself. 'It's cobbled together from borrowed pieces,' he said. The step module design, now in the patent process, opens up the sandwich to look more like a zig-zag. This allows heat to radiate more efficiently, so the module can receive greater concentrations of sunlight without overheating. Jaffe said one of the primary objections to space solar power is the idea of an antenna shooting a concentrated beam of energy through our atmosphere. But we already use radiofrequency and microwaves to send smaller amounts of energy all the time, he believes. 'People might not associate radio waves with carrying energy,' says Jaffe, 'because they think of them for communications, like radio, TV, or cell phones. 'They don't think about them as carrying usable amounts of power.' There are a few ways to mitigate this concern. First, the antenna sends energy only to a specific receiver that asks for it. Second, using microwaves to send energy may be less objectionable than the higher power density required for lasers. Dr. Paul Jaffe holds a module he designed for space solar power in front of the customized vacuum chamber used to test it. Third, sending the energy on a lower frequency increases the size of the antenna and receiver, but decreases the concentration of power. 'The most sobering thing about all of this is scale,' said Jaffe. He imagines a one kilometer array of modules-not to mention the auxiliary sun reflectors. The International Space Station is the only satellite that, to date, has come close. It stretches a little longer than an American football field; the array Jaffe is talking about would span nine. The modules would have to be launched separately, and then assembled in space by robots. That research is already being advanced by NRL's Space Robotics Group. 'Another area ripe for research,"" adds Jaffe, 'is the system that would reflect and concentrate sunlight onto the modules.' NRL and others have also proposed using similar technology, but instead of deploying it to space, setting it up at a very high altitude in the stratosphere. 'You wouldn't get the same 24-hour energy, but you'd be above the clouds and you'd also have a longer daytime because you're farther from the horizon.'","System could capture power in space and beam to Earth .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . Killer: Simon Tarry, 27, landed a devastating punch on John Millett, 34, outside a Manchester nightclub . A boxer who killed a man with a single punch during a brawl outside a nightclub has been jailed for five years. Simon Tarry, 27, was 'spoiling for a fight' when he thumped John Millett in the face after an early-morning row about they way he had approached two women. Mr Millett, a father of two, suffered catastrophic head injuries and died in hospital of his wounds a week after the attack in front of South, a night club in Manchester city centre. A jury was told how, moments before the attack, Tarry threw a right hook at another man but missed, before throwing a bag of rubbish at a group of Mr Millett's friends. At Manchester Crown Court Tarry, from Stretford, Greater Manchester, denied manslaughter but was convicted after a trial. Judge David Stockdale QC told him: 'You were plainly spoiling for a fight - bouncing on your toes like a boxer. It is perhaps no coincidence that you are a former boxer. 'You knew how to move in a fight and knew how to punch and punch hard... You had the opportunity to move away but you chose not to do so. 'In my judgement John Millett was intending to hit you - but that was what you wanted him to do. With the skill you learnt in the boxing ring, as he moved towards you you moved quickly forward towards him and threw a hard, well-aimed punch to the left-hand side of his head. Fatal moment: Tarry (circled) was caught on CCTV goading the men around him before lashing out . 'You wanted a fight. You goaded John Millett into trying to hit you and he was no match for you. You ended his life. That is an event from which his family and friends will never recover.' Tarry threw the fatal punch on January 24 this year. Mr Millett, who was known as Salford John on Manchester's nightclub scene, was celebrating a friend's birthday at the club. Victim: Mr Millett, a father of two, was a well-known figure on the Manchester club scene, and had been telling Tarry to 'chill out' before he was struck . Tarry was seen approaching a group of women outside the club, which led to him being approached by an unnamed man. The court heard that he then threw a bag of rubbish at the man, prompting one of Mr Millett's friends to confront him about his behaviour. When Mr Millett saw this he tried to intervene, which led to Tarry throwing the punch at his jaw. John Wheeler, the friend whose birthday was being celebrated, said Mr Millett intervened because Mr Wheeler's sister was near Tarry, who was 'jumping around' aggressively. He said the yob was walking backwards in front of him, 'ready to fight anyone who came towards him', saying 'come on then' as he urged him to 'chill out'. Describing the fatal blow, he said: 'John kind of came alongside me, then I just heard this loud sort of slapping sound...I saw John go down. 'It happened really quickly. In hindsight it would've been ideal for me to get everyone together and say ""there's going to be trouble, it's time to go home"", and get everybody home safely.' When Tarry was approached by a PCSO he said 'I f*****d up. I hoped the kid's OK', and added: 'He was going to rush me'. The following day he told police he was acting in self-defence. The court heard he had previous convictions for public order offences, criminal damage, assault and GBH, in which he punched a 28-year-old man and fractured his cheekbone. Mr Millett's sister Charlotte said: '100 years in jail wouldn't have been enough for Tarry. It's never going to bring John back. People need to think of their actions and the consequences that one punch can have. A lot of people don't realise when you punch someone you can kill them.'","Simon Tarry, 27, lashed out at John Millett, 34, outside Manchester nightclub .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Harry Redknapp has offered dubious support to Malky Mackay - the football manager accused of sending racist texts - insisting: 'He hasn't murdered anyone, he hasn't raped anyone and he is not a paedophile.' The Queens Park Rangers manager made the controversial remark days after it was claimed Mackay had exchanged a series of racist, sexist and homophobic text messages with Iain Moody while they were at Cardiff City football club. Mr Redknapp believes the Scot should be given the chance to redeem himself, adding: 'He's made a mistake and it shouldn't end his football career.' Scroll down for video .

But Troy Townsend, the education and development manager for the anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out has been left dismayed by the comments. 'What he has said has no benefit at all. I don't know what is in Harry's head when he's saying that. '(Mackay's alleged comments) have anti-Semitic and racial connotations and at the end of the day it's affecting a group of people and we should be more respectful of those people. 'What Harry has said shows a lack of understanding about the situation. These are really sensitive issues and you have to respect the reasons behind them. He's almost saying 'it ain't that bad is it?', but unfortunately for some people, it is.' The text exchanges outlined in the Daily Mail's exclusive report date back to when Mackay and Moody worked as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff City, before both were sacked by club owner Vincent Tan amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market. Mackay's agent Raymond Sparkes later told Sky Sports News that he was 'shocked and stunned' after details of the texts were released. The League Managers' Association said the club had searched more than 10,000 private text messages and found two from Mackay adding, intially, that they were 'with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures'. One of the texts he and Moody are alleged to have shared said: 'He's a snake, a gay snake. Not to be trusted', referring to an official at another club . Former Tottenham manager Redknapp says he acknowledges that Mackay and Moody had made a 'big mistake' but that Mackay was a 'great fella, a family man, a football man'. Harry Redknapp, pictured, acknowledged that Mackay and Moody had made a 'big mistake' but that Mackay was a 'great fella, a family man, a football man' He added: ‘Suddenly everybody's an angel.

He's made a mistake and it shouldn't end his football career. ‘I'm lucky I don’t send text messages but I do get silly message with sick jokes on them from time to time.’ Mackay was set to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the FA.

Moody, meanwhile, resigned from his position as Palace’s sporting director. On Thursday, the League Managers Association issued a statement on behalf of Mackay - before a backlash forced them into a humbling apology. The original statement read: ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. ‘These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.’ Mackay, pictured right with Iain Moody, was set to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the FA . But less than 24 hours later, a second statement was released: 'The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention. 'It is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory, even used in private, are totally unacceptable. 'The LMA will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to Malky Mackay whilst The FA conducts its investigation, other than to repeat that both the LMA and Malky will be cooperating fully. 'We will continue to work with all of the game's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms.'","Harry Redknapp has backed Malky Mackay to return to management .

Top Chef host Padma Laksmi and other crew working on the Bravo show were subjected to a volley of racist, homophobic and sexist abuse from picketers affiliated with the Teamsters union during filming in Boston in June . A Top Chef crew-member told Deadline that everyone associated with filming – including Indian-born host and judge Padma - were subjected to vile abuse over a two week period. When a car ferrying the 43-year-old beauty to the first day of the shoot pulled up outside the restaurant, one of the picketers ran up to her car and screamed, ‘We’re gonna bash that pretty face in, you f****** w****!’ ‘She was scared,’ said the unnamed crew-member. ‘He was screaming at her aggressively and violently.’ ‘As any employee of our show walked on or off set, the picketers verbally attacked us, calling the gays ‘f***,’ the blacks ‘n******’ and most of the women ‘s**** and w*****,’ the crew-member told Deadline.

Padma, who is both host and judge on Top Chef, was said to be scared after she was confronted by Teamsters, stock image right, who screamed at her aggressively and violently . Police were called to the disturbance and immediately radioed for backup. Milton’s Deputy Police Chief John King described the Teamsters as ‘hostile, swearing, and refusing to let people come in and out. Officers repeatedly tried to de-escalate the situation.’ As well as hurling abuse and being intimidating, the union members also slashed the tires on 14 different cars owned by the crew and many also had their antennae broken off, said King. The employees were subject to further abuse for two whole weeks of filming, but no one was injured and no one was arrested.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A mother has been sentenced to more than a year in prison for assaulting a teacher, a principal and cafeteria worker at her son's school after being told she needed a visitor's badge to see him. Jessica Smallwood, 25, from Akron, Ohio, was sentenced to 14 months on Tuesday after she pleaded guilty to three counts of assault that were felonies because they involved educators. Smallwood had gone to Glover Elementary School on February 21 to escort her seven-year-old son - who had had trouble with bullies in the past - to breakfast, The Akron Beacon Journal reported. But when she entered the cafeteria, she was approached by Principal Nancy Ritch, who told her she needed a visitor's badge to be there. Fight: Jessica Smallwood, left, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for attacking school Principal Nancy Ritch, right, and two other staffers after she was told to get a visitor's pass to see her son . She became annoyed and started arguing with Ritch and a teacher. She cursed at them before pushing the teacher and knocking the principal to the ground, police said. She then hit a cafeteria worker who had intervened, police said. During the incident - which her seven-year-old special needs son witnessed - the elementary school was placed on lockdown. The boy also saw his mother being led away in handcuffs by police. The principal suffered head injuries in the melee and was treated by paramedics at the scene. Smallwood's sister, Jennifer Smallwood, told the Beacon Journal after the incident that it didn't add up because the mother is a well-known parent who walked her son to his classroom every day. Scene: Her seven-year-old son watched as she pushed the staffers, cursed and knocked them to the ground during the incident in February. He is now staying with relatives . She added that her sister had often met with school officials to talk about her son being bullied and would sometimes sit with him during breakfast. After Smallwood was sentenced to prison on Tuesday, her attorney said she was upset and shocked by the sentence. He said he will seek early release from prison later this year. Smallwood has a past conviction for trafficking marijuana and attempted tampering with evidence in 2011 but she has never served time in prison, the Beacon Journal reported. Her son is being cared for by family members.","Jessica Smallwood was sentenced to 14 months after pleading guilty to the three assaults - which were felonies because they involved teachers .

"By . Jason Groves - Deputy Political Editor, Daily Mail . Easy access to online pornography is wrecking adolescence for many young people, according to a new Opinium survey out today (file photo) Easy access to online pornography is wrecking adolescence for many young people, a new survey of teenagers warns today. The Opinium survey of 18-year-olds paints a bleak picture of teenage life where young girls and boys feel under intense pressure to conform to pornographic norms. An astonishing 80 per cent said it was too easy to stumble across explicit images and videos on the internet. Almost half (46 per cent) said the phenomenon of ‘sexting’, where people send explicit pictures of themselves to others, was ‘part of everyday life for teenagers nowadays’. And a majority said pornography was making life harder for adolescents. Two-thirds of girls and almost half of boys said it would be ‘easier growing up if pornography was less easy to access for young people’. Seventy per cent said watching porn was seen as normal among their classmates at school. One in 10 said it had become common among their peers by the age of 11. More than half (55 per cent) said they had stumbled across images that made them ‘worried or uncomfortable’ while surfing the internet. Just one in 10 told their parents about the episodes. The survey, commissioned by the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, found that two-thirds of those surveys believe porn is addictive. The findings add weight to the Daily Mail’s campaign to block online porn. Dalia Ben-Galim, associate director at the IPPR, said: ‘This new polling data shows that pornographic images are pervasive in teenagers' lives and that young women in particular are acutely conscious of how damaging they can be. ‘It paints a worrying picture about the way online pornography is shaping the attitudes and behaviour of young people. It is also clear that young people believe the sex education they currently get in school hasn't kept pace with the realities of their digital and social media lifestyles.’ Almost half (46 per cent) of those quizzed said the phenomenon of 'sexting', where people send explicit pictures of themselves to others, was ‘part of everyday life for teenagers nowadays’ Some 72 per cent of 18-year-olds worry that the prevalence of porn leads to ‘unrealistic attitudes’ to sex, while two-thirds said porn has led to pressure on young women to act a certain way and 68 per cent said it has put pressure on girls to look at certain way. Slightly fewer said pornography had put pressure on young men to act and look a particular way (61 per cent and 56 per cent respectively). Seven in 10 of those surveyed said pornography encourages society to view women as sex objects. But the survey also revealed some gender differences in attitudes towards online porn. Almost half of boys (45 per cent) said porn helped young people ‘learn about sex’, compared to just 30 per cent of girls. Two-thirds of the 18-year-olds surveyed said porn has led to pressure on young women to act a certain way and 68 per cent said it has put pressure on girls to look at certain way . Some 40 per cent of girls strongly agree that porn ‘leads to unrealistic attitudes to sex’ compared to just 21 per cent of boys. The survey also found that two-thirds of youngsters think that people are too casual about sex and relationships. The vast majority of those questioned (86 per cent) said that sex and relationship advice should be taught in schools. Some 16 per cent said their main source of information about sex and relationships was pornographic websites, with another 26 per cent identifying the internet as a major source. Just 22 per cent identified their parents as a major source of information. Around two-thirds want sex and relationships education to be taught by a trained expert, 40 per cent think lessons should be given by an external visitor and just a fifth say it should be taught by a teacher at the school.","Opinium survey found sexting 'part of everyday life' for many teenagers .

"By . Aap . and Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . An artist accused of using child pornography in a Melbourne art installation damaged the reputations of the children depicted, a court has heard. Paul Yore, 26, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to producing and possessing child pornography over an installation that included children's faces attached to images of nude adults. Acting Sergeant Kirei Wall told the Melbourne Magistrates Court that although police had not determined who the children were, it was clear their rights had been impinged. Melbourne artist Paul Yore has pleaded not guilty to child pornography charges . 'I ask your honour to consider the reaction of these children,' she told the magistrate on Tuesday. 'Placing these children, cutting out their photographs, encroaches on the rights and the reputations of children', Ms Wall said. The work, titled 'Everything is F*****', was on display at St Kilda's Linden Centre for Contemporary Art last year. Defence barrister Neil Clelland said the work was not child pornography, but a legitimate form of art. 'You might not like the art, you might find it offensive,' Mr Clelland said. The images were part of an exhibit at the St Kilda's Linden Centre for Contemporary Art last year . '(But) it is not being used for the purposes of sexual gratification or prurient motives. It is artistic expression', he continued. National Gallery of Victoria senior curator of contemporary art Max Delany told the court that Yore - from Footscray just west of Melbourne - was a talented, serious and accomplished artist. He said the installation could be interpreted in a number of different ways, but said the work certainly had artistic merit. In the Melbourne Magistrates Court Yore's defence argued the installation was a legitimate form of art .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Two young Amish sisters were sexually abused after their abduction from a roadside farm stand in northern New York, a prosecutor said Saturday. St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain's disclosure came hours after the county's sheriff said the couple charged in the kidnapping were prowling for easy targets and may have planned to abduct other children. Stephen Howells Jr. and Nicole Vaisey, both of Hermon, were arrested and arraigned Friday on charges they abducted the 7-year-old and 12-year-old sisters with the intent to physically or sexually abuse them. Scroll down for video . Stephen Howells II and Nicole Vaisey have been charged with intending to sexually abuse or physically harm two girls and two counts of first-degree kidnapping . Arrests made: Stephen Howells II, 39 (left), and 25-yeasr-old Nicole Vaisey (right) were arrested Friday in connection to the kidnapping of two Amish girls in Upstate New York . 'We . felt that there was the definite potential that there was going to be . other victims,' St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said. The . sisters were abducted Wednesday from the farm stand in front of the . family's home in Oswegatchie, near the Canadian border. They were set . free by their captors about 24 hours later and turned up safe at the . door of a house 15 miles from where they were taken. The . sheriff said Howells, 39, and Vaisey, 25, 'were targeting . opportunities' and did not necessarily grab the girls because they were . Amish. 'There was a lot of thought process that went into this,' Wells said. 'They were looking for opportunities to victimize.' The suspects are being held without bail. A preliminary court appearance is scheduled for Thursday. Vaisey's . lawyer, Bradford Riendeau told The New York Times that Howells had . abused Vaisey and treated her submissively. He said she made a 'voluntary statement' to investigators after her arrest and was . obtaining an order of protection against him. 'She appears to have been the slave and he was the master,' Riendeau told the newspaper. There was no answer Saturday at the St. Lawrence County Conflict Defender's Office, which is representing Howells. Wells said the girls were able to provide details to investigators about their time in captivity. The . kidnappings touched off a massive search in the family's remote farming . community. Searchers scoured the community of about 4,000 people, but . were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls. The . Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work . with an artist who spoke their language, a German dialect known as . Pennsylvania Dutch, to produce a sketch of the older girl. Meanwhile little is known about the accused. A neighbor described them as boyfriend and girlfriend to 7News and said three other children lived in the house. On his Facebook page, Howells appears to be a father to three children. It's uncertain whether his girlfriend, Vaisey, is the mother. Two cars were parked on the property, one red and one white, which appear to match descriptions of the vehicles used in the kidnapping. The couple could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted. A photo posted to Howell's Facebook shows two cars parked on his property, which seem to match the description of the vehicles used in the kidnapping . Relief: Supporters gather on the porch of the family's house Thursday after the two girls were returned safe . Distance: The above map shows the distance between Oswegatchie, the town where the girls disappeared, and Richville, where they were found. About 12 miles from Richville is Hermon, NY, where the suspects were arrested at their home . The girls 'seem to be healthy' after being reunited with family, officials say. The episode left a sense of vulnerability in a community where residents said even small children often walk unaccompanied to school. 'One thing that comes from this is that people learn this can happen in a small town,' Rain said. ""I think the public will take precautions, and that's the sad thing.' Patricia Ritchie, the state senator representing the region, said many are now reluctant to let their children play outdoors unattended. Ritchie said the Amish are responding in a way that may forever change a familiar feature of the local landscape: Some are taking down their roadside stands. 'This has sent a shockwave through their community,' she said. If convicted in the kidnapping, the couple could spend 25 years to life in prison .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . Four-year-old Lyla has become the youngest person ever to sample the $295 nine-course tasting menu at world-renowned restaurant The French Laundry - and her verdict is in. Lyla spent over five hours at chef Thomas Keller's triple Michelin star eatery, located in California's Nappy Valley; where she was served everything from caviar and butter-poached lobster to 'hen egg custard' and truffled gnocchi, as Bold Italic took notes on her opinions. The summer melon soup was held in particular high regard for tasting like 'Tinker Bell Popsicles', but the edible flowers were puzzling for Lyla, and upon assessing the Jardinière de légumes, she piped up: 'At least it’s a salad, but it’s not very much salad.' Where's the rest of it? Four-year-old Lyla reviewed the nine-course tasting menu at The French Laundry, a California restaurant with three Michelin stars, widely hailed as being 'the best restaurant in the world' The French Laundry has been hailed by celebrity chef and food critic Anthony Bourdain as 'the best restaurant in the world, period' - and crucially for Lyla, has 'the most elegant bathroom I've ever SEEN.' Established in 1978, it serves two different nine-course tasting menus daily; none of which uses the same ingredient twice. The fixed price is $295 before tipping, and wine pairing costs an extra $250; although in this case it was ginger ale served in a champagne glass, which Lyla was 'obsessed' with. 'Is this a flower? To eat? Eww. I'm keeping this. I'm gonna give it some water' Lyla's first dish - an amuse-bouche consisting of 'avocado and lime crème fraîche wrapped in a sesame-seed tuile' - looked deceptively like an ice cream cone; which happens to be Lyla's favorite food (as long as it's a 'HARD cone'). 'I like the white part better than the green part,' she surmised, after she had recovered from the crippling disappointment of the ice cream no-show. Mixed feelings: The soup was held in high regard for tasting like 'Tinker Bell Popsicles', but Lyla was disappointed when an amuse-bouche which looked like an ice cream turned out to be an avocado wrap . After the summer melon soup - which was green, thus perhaps the Tinkerbell reference - Lyla was served two fishy dishes; the restaurant's notoriously decadent 'oysters and pearls' caviar plate, and the 'citrus-cured pacific yellowtail.' Lyla obstinately refused to try either of them, because they looked to be 'really not good.' 'It looks like the house that bees live in. And I HATE bees!' Next up was the 'hen egg custard,' which was served in an egg shell with its top sawn-off and filled with a 'ragoût of périgord truffles.' Lyla was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of the egg, theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it. Once she'd forgiven the chef his blatant lie, she loved this course, and concluded that the chicken was like a 'fluffy marshmallow' and the feather tasted like a 'potato chip.' It should be noted that neither chicken nor feather were present in this meal. Swanky: Established in 1978, French Laundry serves two different nine-course tasting menus daily; none of which uses the same ingredient twice . What are you misleading me? Lyla was deeply suspicious about the authenticity of this egg, theorizing that it is simply impossible to take off the top of a real shell without cracking it . The following meaty charcuterie board was eschewed in favor of the accompanying bread, which she gobbled up with great relish before demanding seconds. As for the pretentiously small salad, Lyla insisted that the peppers 'taste like babies', and that the edible flower was downright bonkers. 'Is this a flower? To eat? Eww. I'm keeping this. 'I'm gonna give it some water,' she said with some concern, before instead chopping it up into pieces on the tablecloth. Excellent taste: Lyla was 'obsessed' with the ginger ale (pictured) and she also loved the shaved truffles, which she referred to fondly as 'black diamonds.' Her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be better if they were pink . Thrillingly, the next course consisted of more bread; this time served with 'molded butter.' Lyla was outraged. 'It looks like the house that bees live in. And I HATE bees!' she exclaimed. There was another argument regarding the following dish, the 'sweet butter-poached maine lobster with black mission fig jam', which Lyla maintained was in fact shrimp. The shaved truffles on the 'russet potato gnocchi' were a delight for the four-year-old critic with surprisingly sophisticated taste, likened fondly to 'black diamonds.' Her only suggestion to the chef was that they would be even better if they were pink. Impressive notes of chocolate: The rich assortment of desserts went down a treat with Lyla, providing a sugary ending to a roller-coaster of culinary first's for the adorable tot . Spoiled for life: When Lyla's mother suggested they head out for a good old-fashioned pizza next time, she demanded they go back to The French Laundry instead . The 'herb roasted elysian fields farm lamb' was branded 'not delicious' and the subsequent 'cabot clothbound cheddar', though it claimed to be served with 'garden broccoli', was accused by Lyla of being yet another dishonesty. 'I don't see any broccoli. It's just a square with other stuff!' she proclaimed. 'I don't see any broccoli. It's just a square with other stuff!'

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . 'Irresistible': Sex offender Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25, allegedly had trysts with two civilian workers at the Hillsboro, Oregon, jail identified as Brett Robinson, 32, and 38-year-old Jill Curry . The Washington County Sheriff's Office has now named the inmate who allegedly had sex with two female jail employees, as more details are beginning to emerge about the lovers' illicit encounters. Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25, has been linked to two civilian jail services workers at the Hillsboro jail identified as Brett Robinson, 32, and 38-year-old Jill Curry. The inmate's name was first made public Thursday by the station KPTV. Robinson was arrested earlier this week on multiple counts of custodial sexual misconduct after officials learned of her alleged affair with the inmate while investigating Jill Curry. The 38-year-old veteran jail worker, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, was arrested last month on similar charges stemming from her alleged tryst with Mr Delgado-Galban. According to court documents released to The Oregonian Wednesday, Mrs Curry repeatedly released the inmate out of his cell inside the jail's maximum security unit, walked him to a supply closet and had sex with him. Investigators said they have obtained videos showing the married woman entering the closet with Delgado-Galban on several occasions. It remains unknown at this time whether Ms Robinson also used the same closet for her sexual encounters with Delgado-Galban. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, the man failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Robinson and Curry. On Wednesday, Sheriff Pat Garrett had some harsh words for his two former staffers. ‘They didn't cross the line; they torched it,’ Garrett said. In the wake of the scandal, Garrett said his department has added surveillance cameras inside the jail and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again. Brett Robinson, 32, was arrested Tuesday after a grand jury indicted her on charges of custodial sexual misconduct. She was later released after posting $12,000 bail. The revelation comes about a month after Jill Curry's arraignment on similar charges. 'Romantic rivals:' Brett Robinson (left), 32, a staffer at an Oregon jail, was arrested August 19 for allegedly having sex with the same inmate who allegedly had a trsyt with her colleague, Jill Curry, (right) 38, who was arrested last month . The Oregonian reported that both women worked as civilian jail service technicians whose duties included booking and control room operations. The Washington County sheriff's office said it is reviewing jail operations in light of the allegations against its staff. A spokesman, Sgt. Bob Ray, said Curry and Robinson did not know about one another's contact with the inmate. The jail holds 572 inmates and has a staff of 180 corrections deputies and civilian workers. Jill Curry, 38, was arrested July 16 on charges of first-degree custodial misconduct with an inmate. During her arraignment three weeks later, the long-time jail employee was charged with more than two dozen criminal counts, including identity theft. She pleaded not guilty and is due back in court next Monday, reported Hillsboro Tribune. The 38-year-old woman has been working within the sheriff's office since October 2004. Curry's indictment stated that the jail staffer had sex numerous time with the inmate in question between May 25 and July 3. Mrs Curry is married to a sheriff's deputy, who has since filed for divorce. According to officials, the allegations against Brett Robinson came to light as a result of the Curry investigation. ‘I consider allegations that involve a second Jail staff member in this case extraordinarily serious,’ said Sheriff Garrett. ‘Addressing these issues demands immediate changes and a thorough, holistic review of protocols within the jail. Both efforts are under way. ‘ . Robinson, who has been working at the jail since January 2013, was placed on administrative leave July 30. The following day, she was placed on unpaid leave based on the facts of the case. The sheriff's office has been tight-lipped about the details of the investigations concerning Curry and Robinson, declining to specify where and under what circumstances the alleged sexual encounters took place. The name of the inmate at the center of the controversy has not been released, but sheriff's officials revealed that he is facing a slew of charges in connection to four separate cases. The unidentified suspect, who is listed as a victim in the probes of the two jail employees, is accused of failing to register as a sex offender; tempering with a witness; sexual harassment and second-degree assault.","Jang-Li Delgado-Galban, 25, allegedly had sex in Hillsboro, Oregon, jail with two female workers .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Shakira performs  at the 62nd annual BMI Pop Awards at the Regent Beverly Wilshire in California. Her hit song 'Loca' broke copyright rules according to a New York judge . A hit song performed by pop star Shakira was copied from another songwriter's work, a New York judge  has found. Shakira's Spanish-language version of Loca, released in 2010, infringed a song by Dominican singer Ramon Arias Vazquez, according to Judge Alvin Hellerstein. The song went on to sell more than five million copies and topped Billboard Magazine's Latin charts. It was a collaboration with Dominican rapper Eduard Edwin Bello Pou, known as El Cata – and was widely released as a single around the world. In a ruling on Tuesday, Judge Hellerstein said that  the hit single had been based on an earlier version of a song recorded by Bello, El Cata, which had been copied from Arias Vasquez's original song. 'There is no dispute that Shakira's version of the song was based on Bello's version,' wrote the judge in his ruling. 'Accordingly, I find that, since Bello had copied Arias, whoever wrote Shakira's version of the song also indirectly copied Arias,' he concluded. Ramon Arias Vazquez penned his song Loca con su Tiguere in the 1990s, but Bello denied copying it. Vasquez says he wrote and recorded the song after his sister had been caught up in a love triangle between a wealthy man  and her boyfriend, a 'Tiguere' — Dominican slang for 'street tough'. The singer-songwriter said he performed the song for rapper Bello in 2006 or 2007 when they met outside a rehearsal studio in the hope that he would record it. Loca was a collaboration with Dominican rapper Eduard Edwin Bello Pou, known as El Cata, and he is thought to have stolen the song from Ramon Arias Vazquez . But Bello claimed the song as his own. He later took the song to Shakira, who reworked it with him and rapper Pitbull, and put it out on her 2010 album 'Sale el Sol.' Shakira's song was distributed by Sony in both Spanish and English, but the copyright lawsuit mainly focused on the Spanish version. The English language version of Loca - which featured Dizzee Rascal - was 'not offered into evidence' at the trial. Neither version of Loca was released as a single in the UK. Damages have not yet been determined for the plaintiff, Mayimba Music, which holds the rights to Arias' work. The Colombian singer performed at the World Cup closing ceremony in Rio de Janeiro.

"By . Associated Press . and Reuters . and Damien Gayle for MailOnline . America and its allies must extend the campaign against the Islamic State into Syria, say U.S. military officials. The U.S. has so far restricted its military action to Iraq, but there are concerns the action against the terror group will not be effective while it still has safe havens across the border. U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the Pentagon last night that the current strategy can only contain Islamic State, not defeat it. Scroll down for video . 'We're looking at all the options': U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, left, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey speak to the media during a press briefing at the Pentagon . 'This is an organisation that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,' he said. 'Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a non-existent border.' In the UK senior Tory MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former Secretary of State for Defence, went even further, saying the West must be prepared to work with Syria's pariah president, Bashar al-Assad, to fight Islamic State. 'Sometimes you have to develop relationships with people who are extremely nasty in order to get rid of people who are even nastier,' Sir Malcolm told the Financial Times. Enemy's enemy... Senior MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind, left, a former UK defence secretary, said the West must be prepared to work with Syria's pariah President Bashar al-Assad, right, to fight the Islamic State threat . Found their footing: Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers stand guard at Mosul Dam in northern Iraq yesterday after it was recaptured from Islamic State militants with the help of heavy air strike support from the U.S. military . The Islamic State insurgency in northern Iraq and Syria is, it seems, leading to a significant redrawing of political allegiances across the Middle East – at least temporarily. Calls for political engagement with the Ba'athist regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as well as the theocrats of Iran have made them unlikely potential bedfellows of the U.S. and its European allies. Just 12 months ago, Western lawmakers were seriously debating launching air strikes against Syrian Army positions in an effort to halt its resistance to rebels who sought to overthrow the dictatorship. Now those very rebels' Syrian strongholds are all but in the sights of the U.S. Air Force's drones and bombers, while a senior UK parliamentarian has identified Assad as the enemy's enemy who is now our friend. Iran too was facing the threat of military action to halt the nuclear programme which Israel, in particular, feared was working towards an atomic weapons programme. But with the U.S. saying it may deploy limited 'boots on the ground' to defend American interests in Baghdad there is the bizarre prospect of GIs standing shoulder to shoulder with Iranian Revolutionary Guards already stationed in Iraq. Meanwhile, Israel's recent air and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, ostensibly against Hamas militants but effectively hitting thousands of Palestinian civilians, has seen the Jewish state's international standing plummet. And there are questions about how far Islamic State's power and influence is down to the help of wealthy individuals in Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich U.S. ally. The kingdom is well-known for espousing a fanatic form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, whose adherents, like the Islamic State's militants, are violently opposed to the beliefs of Shia Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere. The comments came after U.S. air strikes helped Iraqi and Kurdish forces regain their footing in Iraq, including the recapture of the strategically vital Mosul dam which had been seized by militants. But U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, who spoke alongside Gen. Dempsey at the Pentagon, warned that the Well-resourced militants from Islamic State can be expected to regroup and counter-attack. 'We're looking at all options,' said Mr Hagel, who said the group, which has capitalised on the disenfranchisement of millions of Iraqi and Syrian Sunni Muslims, was the biggest terror threat the world has ever seen. 'They are an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else,' said Mr Hagel. Asked if Islamic State posed a threat to the United States comparable to that of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Hagel said the group was 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group we have seen. 'They are beyond just a terrorist group,' he said. 'They marry ideology, a sophistication of ... military prowess. They are tremendously well-funded. This is beyond anything we've seen.' The stepping up of rhetoric against the Islamic State - which is alternatively known as ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), or ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) - came after the group apparently released a video showing the gruesome murder of an American photojournalist, James Foley. Militants from the group, which is so extreme in its tactics and ideology it has even been disowned by Al-Qaeda, has seized territory across northern Iraq, but its power base is in regions of Syria rendered lawless by the three-year-old civil war against President Assad's Ba'ath Party regime - a secular socialist dictatorship. In Iraq, the anger of Sunni Muslims sidelined by the Shia-led government of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was said to have helped engender public support for the advances of Islamic State militants. Gruesome: The video which purports to show the murder by beheading of James Foley, an American photojournalist taken hostage by militants from the Islamic State . Mr Hagel said: 'ISIS will only truly be defeated when it's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised Sunni that happen to reside between Damascus and Baghdad.' But analysts have said Syrians opposed to the Assad's government have been left with a deep sense of bitterness at the apparent change in approach to the regime, which is accused of a range of human rights abuses in its attempts to defeat rebels and win the civil war. Yesterday marked a year since a chemical attack that killed hundreds near Damascus. Despite uncertainty as to who launched it, the West had blamed Assad's military for the killings. Hassan Taqieddine of eastern Ghouta, the Damascus suburb hit by the attack, told the Associated Press via Skype that he is still haunted by what he saw that day. 'And here we are, a year later, still getting bombed with barrel bombs, warplanes and chlorine, and no one cares,' he said. President Assad has long maintained that the uprising against him was a conspiracy carried out by Islamic extremists and terrorists, not a revolt against a dictatorship. Fanatics: A fighter from the Islamic State holds up the group's black banner in the city of Raqqa, Syria . Neither Mr Hagel nor General Dempsey gave any indication of an imminent change in the U.S. military approach in Iraq, which President Barack Obama has said will include further airstrikes but not the introduction of American ground forces. The Pentagon yesterday said U.S. warplanes had launched six airstrikes overnight to help solidify Iraqi and Kurdish forces' efforts to retake and maintain control of the Mosul Dam. It said the latest strikes destroyed or damaged three Humvees, multiple roadside bombs and another insurgent vehicle. The attacks brought to 90 the number of U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq since August 8. Of those, 57 have been in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam.","Islamic State cannot be defeated while it has safe havens in Syria, says U.S.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Texas Governor Rick Perry's mug-shot has gone viral after he turned himself in at Travis County Courthouse in Texas . He turned himself in at a Texas courthouse after being indicted on two counts of abuse of power. But after posing for a smirking mugshot, Texas Governor Rick Perry's police photograph has gone viral, inspiring hundreds of memes. From starring in his own movie, to gracing the cover of GQ for the annual indicted governors issue, people have been quick to add their own special touches to the smug shot. He arrived at the Travis County Courthouse on Tuesday for booking on one felony count of abuse of official capactiy and one count of coercion of a public servant. The Republican governor formally entered a not guilty plea and said he would 'fight this injustice with every fibre of my being' and prevail. 'I'm here today because I believe in the rule of law. I'm here today because I did the right thing. I'm going to enter this courthouse with my head held high knowing the actions I took were not only lawful and legal but right,' he said. 'This issue is far bigger than me, it's about the rule of law, it's about the constitution which allows not just the governor but every citizen to speak their mind free of political interference or legal intimidation. 'This indictment is nothing short of an attack on the constitutional powers of the office of governor. There are important fundamental issues at stake and I will not allow this attack on our system of government to stand.' Perry even made the cover of this spoof GQ for the annual indicted governors issue and was given a pair of comedy glasses in one of the memes after removing his own for the picture . Perry was indicted by a  jury in Austin last Friday over his veto of $7.5million  in funding to a public integrity unit headed by Rosemary Lehmberg, the district attorney for Travis County. The Texas Governor called for her resignation after she was convicted of drunk-driving in April last year and carried out the veto when she refused to step down. Austin Police Department released his mug-shot to the public and people quickly took to twitter to correct the lack of glasses and add their own special touches. There was even a reference to Robert Burt, the Maine teen who showed up for his booking photo wearing a T-shirt bearing his mug shot from a previous arrest. His mug shot quickly prompted a meme, with the (left) picture inspired by the Maine teenager who turned up for his booking photo wearing a t-shit with the picture from his previous arrest . The Texas Governor was given a starring role in his own movie and inspired a spoof election poster . The Texas Governor said he would 'fight this injustice with every fibre of my being' and prevail . Minutes after he was fingerprinted at the courthouse, the Texas Governor  posted a photo from his official Twitter account of him outside Sandy's Hamburgers in down-town Austin. The photo shows Perry holding an ice cream cone, with his arm around a woman. His attorneys, David Botsford and Tony Buzbee, are standing nearby with their own ice cream cones.

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . and Reuters . A Maryland State Police trooper has been put on administrative suspension after sheriff's deputies responded to a call reporting a naked man drinking at a bar in a barbecue restaurant, authorities said on Wednesday. The incident was just one of at least five high profile naked crimes--from a sword-wielding Florida man to a nude bank robber outside Chicago--that have made headlines across America just since last week. Harford County sheriff's deputies arrived around 11 p.m. on Saturday at the Jarrettsville Pit and located two men who identified themselves as state troopers, reports the Baltimore Sun. A cop walks into a bar...: An unnamed Maryland state trooper allegedly walked into this barbecue joint and bar on Saturday night before drunkenly dropping trou and exposing himself to patrons . The trooper in question appeared intoxicated and denied that he had been naked, sheriff's deputy spokeswoman Christie Kahler said. Customers told deputies one of the troopers had pulled off his pants and at one point exposed himself, according to the report. Neither man was charged. After an internal investigation by the Maryland State Police, one trooper was placed on administrative suspension, state police spokeswoman Elena Russo said. Neither of the men's names were released. The incident is under further investigation by the Maryland State Police and the Maryland District Attorney's Office. In Arlington, Virginia, Roland Hitchens, 42, was naked and intoxicated when he struck two vehicles and wrecked his motorcycle before fleeing into the woods Friday night around 9:30 p.m., police said.

"By . Ruth Styles . She married the grandson of the man behind apartheid before scandalising the Afrikaner community when she became a member of the ANC. Now Melanie Verwoerd, who went on to become an ANC MP and ambassador to Ireland, has penned a memoir of her time with Nelson Mandela - the man she credits with her political transformation. 'I was very worried about meeting him for the first time,' she admits. 'On the night my [now former] . husband wanted to apologise to Madiba for his family’s . contribution to Apartheid. Changing times: Melanie was born into an Afrikaner family during Apartheid but went on to become an ANC MP . Architect: Hendrik Verwoerd was prime minister of South Africa between 1958 and 1966 . 'But he wouldn't hear of it. He said that the Verwoerd surname could either be a hindrance or a . blessing in the new South Africa and that we had to think carefully about what we wanted to do with that power. 'That changed my life. After a lot of thinking, I joined the ANC, became an MP and was . later appointed the South African ambassador to Ireland.' It was the latest stop in a life that could already be described as extraordinary. Born Melanie van NIekerk in 1967 into a well-heeled Afrikaner family in Pretoria, her childhood was comfortable and happy. 'I grew up like any other white Afrikaner . girl,' she remembers. 'I only met African people when the worked in our garden or house. 'I went to an all-white school, lived in a white neighbourhood and only . had white friends. Although we were middle-class, it was a very . privileged existence in comparison to the majority.' Later, she went on to study at the prestigious Stellenbosch University, where she met her husband Wilhelm, the grandson of Hendrik Verwoerd - the man widely credited with the invention of Apartheid. But it would prove to be the last conventional turn her life ever took. In 1985, she and her husband moved to London and there, finally mixing with South Africans from all races, Melanie's political world was turned upside down. Divisive: Verwoerd was seen as controversial in the UK, attracting protests both for and against his plans . New direction: Melanie and her husband joined the ANC in 1989 after meeting exiles in London in the late 80s . 'I first met young South African exiles while . travelling in London and Oxford at the end of 1985,' she remembers. 'They . told me about what was happening to them - something I didn't really . know about before. I was a changed person when I returned to South . Africa. I started . reading and questioning everything.' But when she aired her changing views to her family and friends, their furious reaction and, eventually, complete ostracism, left her saddened. 'The hardest part of it all was the break with the . Verwoerd family,' she says. 'Wilhelm’s father wouldn't speak to us for more than 10 . years. 'It was hard because we had small children and wanted them to see their grandparents. So I would pass them to my . mother-in-law over the fence and wait in the car or a coffee shop until one needed to be breastfed and then I would return and she would hand . them back.' But worse was to come. After Wilhelm's father publicly denounced his son and daughter-in-law, death threats began to pour in. Much missed: Melanie says she was devastated when Mandela died but says he is still her moral compass . Work: Melanie also did a stint at UNICEF and is seen here with a Mozambican boy named Lucky . 'We were put on a hit list and it was very uncomfortable for a . while,' says Melanie, almost laconically. 'It was so much less than what others endured. 'Also, I never give in to bullies and threats. Once you do that you will never be . able to stand up for anything. So it was all worth it . because what we did was morally the right thing to do.' Happily for Melanie, times were changing in South Africa and in 1990, the ANC was taken off the banned list. Four years later, Nelson Mandela and the ANC swept to power - and Melanie, then just 27 years old, with them. 'I was the youngest woman ever to be . elected,' she beams, 'and it was the most . extraordinary time. 'To be able to be there when Madiba addressed parliament, to be able to accompany him to . official engagements... just to be in his presence was simply astonishing. 'It was also a real privilege to play a part in making history, such as when we wrote the final constitution. Not many . people get to do that.' And more success was to come even if, sadly, it was at the expense of her marriage which was by now floundering under the strain. In 2001, she was appointed South Africa's ambassador to the Republic of Ireland, a post which she used to highlight the issue of HIV and AIDS, before stepping down in 2005 as her marriage to Wilhelm finally collapsed. In 2007, she became Executive Director of UNICEF Ireland and travelled the world promoting the charity before her employment came to an abrupt end following the death of her partner, the Irish radio DJ Gerry Ryan. Moving on: Melanie is back in South Africa but continues to campaign on women and children's rights . Now back . in South Africa, she says the world still needs to do more to solve . issues like violence against women and sexual crimes. And . she is working on a series of personal projects too, among them her new . book, Our Madiba, a collection of touching memories of the iconic South . African leader, among them her own. 'I last saw him a few years ago at a lunch in Cape Town,' she smiles. 'He waved at . me to come over which I did and he gave me a big hug. 'He then complained that he was getting old and that the . young women didn't fancy him anymore so I said, ""I still fancy you . Madiba""! 'He then looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, ""Yes, . but you are not so young anymore"" and we both burst out laughing. He . had such a mischievous sense of humour.' Mandela's death last December left her deeply upset but she says South Africa is a better place because of him. 'I was extremely sad,' she says. 'It felt like I had . lost a grandfather. We knew that it was coming and didn't . want him to suffer but it still felt like an enormous loss when he died. 'Our country was a disaster and . no one other than Madiba and the ANC could have taken us through that very difficult transition with such success,' she continues. 'I wouldn't be so pretentious as to think I . played any significant role. I just did what I could and what come . across my road. But Madiba will always be my guiding light and the voice of conscience.'

Almost three months after she lost the ability walk after an horrific ATV accident left her paralyzed from the waist down, Olympic swimmer Any Van Dyken-Rouen has taken her first steps on bionic legs. Van Dyken-Rouen, 41, severed her spine when an ATV rolled on top of her after it flipped over an embankment near the home she shares with her husband, former Denver Broncos player Tom Rouen, near their home in Show Lo, Arizona on June 6. Soon after the accident, she appeared on the Today Show and vowed she would walk again - and on Thursday, she did. Unwavering: Amy van Dyken-Rouen stated after her accident that she was determined to walk again . Standing tall: Van Dyken-Rouen captioned this image she posted to Instagram: 'Standing with my hubby' The six-time gold medalist has been working tirelessly at rehab and has documented her journey on social media. She has been unwaveringly positive about her prospects of walking again, and today she posted pictures and video of herself taking her very first post-accident steps. Deadspin reports that Van Dyken-Rouen was able to stand and walk for the first time using a powered orthosis, or exoskeleton. It's a remarkable advance in such a short period of time since her accident. The case was so serious that she and Rouen said their goodbyes before she went to surgery. Elite athlete: Van Dyken-Rouen's steely determination to walk again mirrors the resolve that netted her six Olympic gold medals in 1996 and 2000 . She told him to move on and be happy in his life, while he said he understood if she needed to leave him. 'One of the things that I told her was if... all this was too much and she wanted to go, she could go, and I'd understand,' Rouen recounted to Matt Lauer on the Today show. However, Van Dyken-Rouen is made of steelier stuff. She won six gold medals at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics. She posted pictures of her standing next to her husband for the first time in 11 weeks. She also managed to stand next to her husband for the first time in two-and-a-half months. 'Who’s excited to be walking around with an exoskeleton?' Van Dyken-Rouen tweeted Thursday.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Fears smokers opting for reduced-nicotine cigarettes would merely smoke more to get their hit are unfounded, say scientists. Past studies have raised concerns that cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine could lead to people increasing the intensity of their habit to satisfy their cravings. But a new study by a team at the University of Waterloo in Canada has suggested the fears may not have been realised. Nicotine is the main addictive ingredient in cigarettes, giving smokers the highs they crave and the withdrawals that can blight an attempt to quit. Scroll down for video . A new study by scientists at the University of Waterloo in Canada, found cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine do not prompt smokers to smoke more to achieve their fix . The researchers involved in the new study said past studies have raised 'concerns that reduced nicotine cigarettes will be smoked more intensely and, therefore, will increase exposure to toxic chemicals in smoke'. Seventy-two adult smokers completed an unblinded trial of reduced nicotine cigarettes. After filling out smoking history surveys, the participants spent seven days smoking their usual choice of cigarette. That was followed by three consecutive weeks smoking different types of Quest, reduced nicotine level cigarettes. Each week the levels of nicotine reduced, from 0.6mg in week two to week four when the participants smoked Quest 3 - with a nicotine emission of 0.05mg. A regular cigarette has a nicotine emission level of around 1.2mg. The scientists found that the smokers taking part did not change the number of cigarettes they smoked or the number of inhalations they took during each of the four weeks. The study authors, said: 'The findings provide little evidence of compensatory smoking of Quest cigarettes - those with lower nicotine levels -, with no increases in exhaled breath carbon monoxide levels and smoking intensity. A study of 72 adult smokers found 'little evidence of compensatory' smoking during a four-week experiment where smokers started with their usual brand, before smoking special low nicotine cigarettes for three weeks . 'No significant differences were observed for smoking urges or measures of nicotine dependence. 'The study adds to the evidence that cigarettes with markedly reduced nicotine content are not associated with increased smoking intensity or exposure to smoke toxicants.' David Hammond, one of the study's . authors, mentions that the FDA now has a mandate 'to reduce nicotine . levels in cigarettes to negligible amounts', Medical Today News reported. He said: 'Our study suggests that smokers are unable or unwilling to compensate . when there is markedly less nicotine in the cigarette and when the . experience of smoking is far less rewarding. 'Our study may help . regulators anticipate the possible consequences of mandatory nicotine . reductions in cigarettes.' The study was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.","Study has countered the belief reduced nicotine cigarettes increase intensity .

She told police she noticed an odd hole in the top of Senzee's shoe at that time but thought nothing of it. However, when Kent went to the checkout queue, Senzee again appeared behind her - but didn't have any items to purchase. She told police that she turned around to look at Senzee and again noticed the hole in his shoe, at which point Senzee began walking away from her. Kent followed him and blocked his path with her shopping cart, demanding to see his shoes. Senzee refused and Kent began yelling, according to the arrest report. An unknown man stoppped Senzee and the camera was pulled from his shoe. Eagle-eyed: The victim noticed Senzee standing close behind her on two occasions before demanding to see his shoe . Senzee's right shoe had a hole cut out of it to accommodate the device's camera, which was taped in place with black electrical tape. According to the Orlando Sentinel, store security footage shows Senzee 'walk up behind [Kent] in the check-out line and extend his right foot under her skirt multiple times.' Police will conduct a search of Senzee's cellphone to determine if there were any additional victims. According to Senzee's Facebook page, he's a married father of several children.","Paul Senzee, 40, was charged with video voyeurism .

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . NFL legend Jim Kelly is free of cancer after three months of chemotherapy, according to the hospital overseeing his treatment. Hall of Fame quarterback Kelly was evaluated on Tuesday at the New York Head & Neck Institute at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and given the good news. Dr Peter Costantino, the hospital’s Executive Director, said: ‘The great news is that upon physical examination, there is no evidence of the cancer. Staying positive: Kelly, pictured with his wife, was diagnosed with sinus cancer earlier this year . Tender: Former NFL quarterback Jim Kelly is pictured dancing with his wife Jill in a gentle embrace on Sunday . ‘The treatments so far have completely eliminated Mr. Kelly's pain and his level of function has essentially returned to normal.’ Kelly will now undergo a series of tests to determine if any further treatment will be necessary. Should treatment be required, it would likely consist of surgery followed by a form of highly focused radiation referred to as Gamma Knife Therapy, the hospital said in a statement. ‘It is possible that no further treatment will be required, and the testing over the next week will define this issue,’ Dr. Costantino said. By his side: His teenage daughter Erin is pictured by his side in hospital, where he underwent chemo . Determined: A few months ago the former football player posted a video promising that he 'will be back' Earlier this year Mr Kelly’s daughter, Erin, posted a touching photograph of her father embracing his wife on Mother’s Day. It carried the caption: 'Daddy just wanted to dance with his bride on Mother's Day.' The former Buffalo Bills quarterback closed his eyes as he appreciated the moment. The Hall of Famer's family has regularly shared snaps of his battle, including their celebrations when he returned home from hospital in April. Kelly, 54, had undergone surgery in Buffalo last June to remove cancerous cells from his upper jaw and he was declared cancer-free. But earlier this year, he announced the disease had returned. Buffalo: Kelly, shown left at 1992's Super Bowl, spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home .","Kelly was evaluated at the New York Head & Neck Institute on Tuesday .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greg for MailOnline . A judge on Thursday dismissed rape charges against former Detroit Tigers pitcher Evan Reed, saying the testimony of the woman who accused him wasn't credible and prosecutors failed to show that force or coercion took place. Reed, 28, was accused of raping the 45-year-old woman in a hotel room at the Motor City Casino in Detroit on March 6 while she was incapacitated. 'Her lies caught up with her,' Reed said after the hearing. He has said they had consensual sex. Case dismissed: Evan Reed appears at his preliminary hearing on a sexual assault charge August 21, 2014 . Reed said he was 'elated' to be cleared of the third-degree criminal sexual conduct charges. He was with the Tigers at the time of the incident and appeared in 27 games for Detroit before being sent to his current assignment with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. The 45-year-old woman testified at Thursday's probable cause hearing that she met Reed at a bar in the suburb of Royal Oak on March 30 and that they later went to a casino in downtown Detroit. She said she 'blacked out' after taking a drink that tasted 'sour' and that she believes had been drugged. The Detroit Free Press reports that surveillance video from that night show the woman falling off a sidewalk onto her back without attempting to brace herself at all. Reed is then seen carrying the woman into the hotel building. Thrown out: Reed pitches during a game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Comerica Park on June in Detroit . However, Judge Kenneth King said there was no evidence the woman was raped inside the hotel. The judge said that the woman appeared to be unimpaired when she walked down a set of stairs, despite claiming she didn't have the presence of mind to take the elevator. 'She wasn’t wobbling, she wasn't falling, she wasn't stumbling,' King said, reports the Free Press. 'And she was wearing high heels.' He did concede that she was definitely incapacitated when she and Reed arrived at the hotel room in which she alleges the sexual assault occurred. 'The problem is what happened in that hotel room … no one knows,' Judge King said. The woman testified today that she was on her third vodka tonic when she noticed the drink tasted particularly sour. Her next memory is waking up naked in bed with Reed. The woman described what happened in graphic detail after she awoke the following morning during her hour-and-a-half testimony. 'Everything was spinning, my head was hurting,' she said. 'I remember getting up and kind of holding on to the wall and going into the bathroom.' She noticed a foul smell and a stain on the sheets; she said she got into the shower where Reed tried to have anal sex with her. She told him no and went back to the bed. 'My mind was telling me all I wanted to do was go back and sleep,' she said, reports CBS. Debauched night: Reed (center) stands with his attorneys Ben Goneck (left) and David Gorcyca charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct . Reed then tried to initiate oral sex with her the woman said, and she refused. After that, she said Reed told her she needed to leave because he had things to do. A police officer who examined the room as part of the investigation testified there was feces on the bed and on towels, but no evidence was taken. Judge Kenneth King threw out the charges, though, saying the woman gave contradictory accounts of what happened, including testifying that she had no idea that Reed and his companions at the bar played for the Tigers, then acknowledging that she texted a friend that evening to say she was with members of the team. 'Because of the alleged victim's vacillating testimony and her inability to remember many parts of the evening, I don't think (prosecutors) have met their burden of probable cause,' he said. Assistant prosecutor Suzette Samuels said afterward that the ruling was 'disappointing,' and that she believes 'it was another value judgment' against a sexual assault victim. She did not say whether her office plans to appeal.

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . The parents of executed journalist James Foley have revealed they shared their grief with 'kind and dear' Pope Francis when he called them at home from The Vatican on Thursday. Diane and John Foley said the pontiff word's were a huge comfort to them as they struggle to deal with the aftermath of their son's barbaric death, which was broadcast to the world by his ISIS captors on Tuesday. While they did not divulge what they and Pope Francis spoke about during their telephone call, the Foleys said they were thankful he called as he deals with his own personal loss after his two small nephews and their mother died in a car crash in Argentina this week. Thankful: John and Diane Foley said that Pope Francis was a huge comfort to them when he called on Thursday to offer them prayers for the loss of their son, James Foley . 'Pope Francis was so dear because he is grieving himself having just lost three members of his family and his nephew is critically ill,' said Diane Foley during an appearance with her husband on the Today show. 'In the midst of his tremendous grief he took the time to call and our whole family was there and my brother-in-law spoke in Spanish to him and he was just so kind.' Having called the family after the global revulsion sparked by the butchering of James Foley, the Pope's phone call left the staunchly Catholic Foleys 'deeply moved and grateful'. 'He offered us his personal prayer and we felt very comforted and supported in that regard,' said John Foley about his talk with Pope Francis. The Foley's took the phone call around 3pm on Thursday at home in New Hampshire and spoke through a translator for around 20 minutes. 'He was very compassionate, very loving,' said the family priest Father Marc Montminy, of St. Michael's Church in Exeter, New Hampshire. Pope Francis called the family of executed American photojournalist James Foley to console them on their loss. He called the Foleys at their home in New Hampshire Thursday afternoon. Pictured above at the Vatican on Wednesday, August 20 . The Pope told John and Diane Foley that they were in his prayers . The Foleys have been in mourning since Tuesday, when a video was posted online showing the gruesome beheading of their son by affiliates of terrorist-group ISIS. James Foley had been missing for two years, after he was kidnapped while reporting in Syria. On Wednesday, his grieving parents gave a press conference outside their Rochester, New Hampshire home, where a yellow ribbon was hung on the front door. 'We are very proud of Jim.  He was a courageous, fearless journalist.  The best of America,' Diane Foley said.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Britain's worst driver: John Mehmet, 30, was given the unofficial title by a judge who jailed him for four years at Blackfriar's Crown Court today . A motorist was branded Britain's worst driver by a judge after smashing into two motorbikes, driving on the wrong side and flipping his car in a police chase that ended with him fleeing police dogs on foot. John Mehmet, 30, of Ham, east London, was given the undesirable title by a judge at Blackfriars Crown Court today who stated that it was 'difficult to imagine a worse case of dangerous driving.' The pursuit began when police spotted Mehmet, wanted for other offences at the time, behind the wheel of a Nissan Juke in north London at around 11am on January 14. When they approached him, he immediately sped off, driving straight into a motorbike and injuring the rider. Instead of stopping to check if the biker was okay, Mehmet ignored the crash and drove away causing police to momentarily lose sight of him. But instead of inconspicuously blending in with traffic, the reckless motorist was next seen dangerously overtaking a number of cars as he drove down the wrong side of the road. He eventually lost control of the car near Liverpool Street station when he hit a raised zebra crossing at high speed before flipping and smashing into a second motorbike. The rider of that bike was hospitalised with two broken wrists and a broken leg and the BMW 1200GS bike burst into flames. After wrecking his car, Mehmet fled the scene on foot but was eventually caught by a police dog unit. He was given four years and two months in jail for a series of motoring offences, including causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and driving while uninsured. Parallel parked:  Mehmet's abandoned car sits on its side in between two lampposts near Liverpool Street station following a three mile high-speed pursuit . Detective Constable Rebekah Hymas said: 'Mehmet's sole intention was to get away from the police at any cost even if it meant jeopardising the safety of pedestrians and other road users. 'This was a very serious incident and I am pleased with the sentence he received. 'I hope the sentence is a warning to anyone else considering driving in this manner.' Mehmet was also disqualified from driving for six years. Reckless: Mehmet hit two motorcyclists during the incident - with one being left with serious injuries .","Wanted John Mehmet, of east London, sped off when police approached .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Thieves have made an audacious attempt to steal a Banksy artwork valued at £1million by removing the bricks it was painted on from the inside of the building. The 'Spybooth', which features three 1950s-style spies eavesdropping on a phone-box, appeared on the outer wall of an end-of-terrace house in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in April. After several pieces of the wall were recently removed from the building without any sign of forced entry - the current owner of Spybooth, Hekmat Kaveh, is calling the attempted theft an inside job. Scroll down for video . Scaffolding has been erected around the Banksy piece in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, while restorative work is done to replace bricks removed by thieves in a failed attempt to steal the artwork . Several bricks have been removed from inside the terraced house in an audacious attempt to steal the artwork . The local businessman agreed to buy the terraced house from the council for an undisclosed six-figure sum and has been looking to make a profit by selling it for £1 million. He said: 'It was a real surprise. When we realised the damage had been done we arranged to go in with the owner. 'There was a lot of damage. Brick work has been taken out all over the place. There is nothing wrong with the overall structure though. 'The council are involved to see if a crime has been committed because it's a Grade II listed building. 'I have written to the council for their view and someone from health and safety has also got in. Structurally, they don't see it as a big issue.' The image above shows how 'Spybooth' first looked when it appeared on this wall in Cheltenham in April . Despite the extensive damage to the inside of the building - there was no sign of forced entry suggesting that whoever did the damage had a key . When the artwork first appeared on the £300,000 terraced house a bidding war ensued - with the council boarding up the wall to prevent vandalism. After Mr Kaveh agreed on a price for the house, the boarding was taken down so that people could enjoy the art -  but the image was soon vandalised and drilled into. The new internal damage is somewhat of a mystery though as no-one is currently living in the property. Mr Kaveh added: 'It's difficult to say how they got in. There was no burglary, let's put it like that. Someone had a key I'm guessing. There was no broken windows or forced entry. 'I think there is something going on in the background but I'm not really sure. There are too many people involved.' A protective board was erected in front of the Banksy piece when it was first discovered - the board has since been taken down . Although happy to continue with the deal, he says he will need several assurances from the council and may offer substantially less money if he has to complete restoration work on the inside. He added: 'Part of my condition was that the council agree a form of protection on it - some form of bullet proof glass to be put up. 'Obviously, the only point is for people to be able to enjoy it. 'I'm really hopeful that we can come up with a glass structure that can protect it. It's about something that looks good and brings tourism to the town. 'There have been a lot of ups and downs but I'm determined to keep at it, as long as it is not permanently damaged - I'm not looking to throw money away.' The artwork drew lots of attention from local residents when it first appeared on the end of the terraced house . Cheltenham Borough Council has been addressing the situation themselves as the building is listed. A council spokesperson said: 'Officers from Cheltenham Borough Council's enforcement team entered the property under a warrant of entry recently. 'Mr Wilson, the owner's business partner, was interviewed under caution in relation to a potential criminal offence under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Evidence is being gathered and investigations continue.' A spokesperson for Gloucestershire Police said: 'A report of a burglary was received but the investigation has been completed. 'We keep an open mind as to the circumstances of the incident. As regards to any possible damage to a listed building, that is a matter for the council.'","'Spybooth' appeared on wall of terraced house in Cheltenham in April .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A teenage girl is so terrified of hair that she is unable to lead a normal life - with the very sight of it making her feel nauseous, nervous and tearful. Sixth form student Emily White, 17, from Barry, Wales, has seen relationships with boys ruined over the irrational phobia which prevents her from straying too close to people's heads. Only recently has she managed to touch her own locks without feeling sick and doctors say the only way to cure the bizarre fear, known as chaetophobia, is to face it head on. Emily White, from Barry, Wales, cannot go near hair without wanting to be sick and crying . Emily said: 'I just hate the texture of hair. There's something about it that makes me feel nauseous and nervous. Thick, curly hair or wet hair is the worst of all. 'My own hair used to make me feel sick too, I hate the feel of it on me. Until about a year ago, I was not even able to touch it without getting scared. 'With a push, I will now put my fingers through my hair or stroke it. 'My mum makes me cut my hair twice a year and the experience is horrible. I despise it so much, especially when I can see my locks all over the floor.' The 17-year-old says the condition, known as chaetophobia, is ruining her life (above her mother, Maria, attempts to comb her locks) Emily's worst ordeal saw her break into tears after encountering some tresses in a public toilet . She explains: 'I was at a Cardiff City football match and went to the loo. I saw a clump of hair in the sink and I screamed in front of everyone and started crying. 'I ran back to my seat in tears and everyone in the stadium was staring at me. My dad didn't know what to do. I just sobbed the whole way through the match.' Emily's mother, Maria Gema, 42, says that she has suffered from the condition since she was a child. Finance Assistant, Maria said: 'Emily's had her phobia for as long as I can remember. I don't know how it started. Emily says she cannot go on dates with boys with hair while her mother says she has suffered from the rare condition since she was a child . 'She used to take baths with her sister and as soon as Emily spotted a hair in the bath, she'd be climbing out. 'Her phobia just progressed from there really. Any natural hair scares the hell out of her. Emily claims the fear developed when she joined secondary school and says when classmated accidentally touched her hair she wwould want to throw up. The word chaetophobia comes from the Greek word 'khaite' meaning ‘loose, flowing hair’. Sufferers dont only fear other people's hair but their own as well. Experts believe the fear can result from a traumatic experience such as having a really bad haircut as a child and being ridiculed for it. Another cause can be explained by post traumatic stress after getting head lice as sufferers will fear further infestations. People with this phobia often try to shave off all of their hair, or have really short hair. Psychotherapy has been known to cure the condition but medication may be needed in the very isolated cases that render the phobic person dysfunctional in society. The 17-year-old is single and says makes dating a nightmare. 'When I first meet a boy, I find their hair really scary. I won't go near it. I don't know what their hair could be like. 'It's so embarrassing having to eventually reveal to a guy I'm dating that I have a phobia of hair. I try to say it on the third date so I can get the awkwardness out of the way. 'It took me about six months to be able to even go near my ex-boyfriend's hair. To be honest, I'd prefer to go out with a guy who has a shaved head instead. At least their locks wouldn't be near me and I wouldn't find loose clumps of it around the floor.' Emily - who has two sisters Carys, 18 and Sophia, 12 - says she is constantly mocked by her friends and family who think her phobia is amusing. She explains: 'My friends always tease me. They take hair from their own head and put it on my back when I'm not looking. If there's a clump of hair lying on the floor, they won't pick it up and I can't move anywhere. 'Once my friend dropped some on me and I froze. I was so scared that I couldn't move for about ten minutes. My friends were eventually forced to take it off me. 'My younger sister, Sophia, teases me too. She chases me around the house with hairbrushes and puts hair in my face. I have a go at her and tell her to leave me alone but she never stops.' Despite the daily afflictions of her phobia, she has never sought medical help. 'I've never considered going to a GP about my problem because it seems silly. When I was younger, I would have liked to have talked to someone about my phobia though.' A spokesperson for Triumph Over Phobia, the phobia charity said: 'Emily needs to have a course of exposure therapy to help her overcome her fear of hair. 'She will only recover if she faces her fear and she can do this by taking little steps each day.' More information and help can be found at the charity's website: www.topuk.org.uk .","Emily White, 17, from Barry, Wales, claims fear is ruining her everyday life .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Workmen have been left looking rather red-faced after making this embarrassing mistake outside a primary school. These pictures show how council workmen somehow managed to spell 'school' wrong outside  Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon, in Scotland. The no-parking road sign outside the tiny village primary is instead spelt 'sckool'. Embarrassing: The workmen who wrote this no-parking sign outside Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon, Scotland, are hardly likely to get top marks for spelling . Accurate: The workmen at least managed to spell 'keep clear' correctly . The embarrassing mistake was spotted by an eagle-eyed photographer in the tiny village of Innellan, which is on the Clyde coast. It is to be hoped the sign is fixed before the tiny school's 154 pupils return from their summer holidays. It is not the first time workmen have been left red-faced by embarrassing signs. Residents in Kettering, Northamptonshire, were left bemused last year when they woke up to discover bumbling workmen had somehow managed to misspell 'clear' on a road sign - instead telling drivers to 'KEEP CELAR'. The giant lettering, measuring a metre high, was painted across the entrance to a small cul-de-sac. Embarrassed council chiefs quickly ordered the sign to be repainted once the mistake was spotted. A spokesman from Northamptonshire County Council blamed the incident on 'human error'. Silly: It's not clear how bumbling workmen got the spelling of this huge Keep Clear sign quite so wrong . Oops! This previous blunder in east London may be even more embarrassing . Road painters have previously misspelled a word in two-foot high neon yellow letters at a bus lane in Canning Town, east London, that marked out a 'Sus Stop'. Workers for Kirklees Council also managed to make a mistake in their bus stop road markings - instead writing 'Bus Sotp'. In front of Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School in Bristol workmen also created the bold legend 'SHOOL'.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A school nurse accused of failing to properly raise the alarm after meeting a 'tormented' teenager three times in the month before her suicide has been charged with professional misconduct. Donna Barbara Moore is said to have had several chances to assess 15-year-old Helena Farrell before the gifted pupil hanged herself in a woodland area near her home in Cumbria on January 4 last year. The nurse, who worked at Kirkbie Kendal School, where Helena was a student, has claimed that initially she 'didn't see the risk' that the tragic pupil would end her own life - despite the girl's extremely distressed state. Helena Farrell, pictured, was found dead in woodlands in Cumbria in January 2013 with Coldplay song The Scientist playing on repeat . Several accusations have now been brought against her - for which she must appear at the Old Bailey on September 1. In all of her time with Helena, it is alleged that she failed to refer her case to children's services or complete a safeguarding profile of the teenager - recording her deep issues. When Helena attempted suicide on December 4 2013 - one month before her death - by taking an overdose, the nurse allegedly failed to make a referral to Cumbria Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in a reasonable period of time - namely between 24 and 48 hours. This and other factors meant Helena did not get an appointment with a social worker from CAMHS until January 3 - the day before her death - where she was deemed as not posing an imminent risk to herself. The inquest in July at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard Helena was a ‘bright, intelligent, adventurous and fun-loving’ girl who was a gifted cellist and singer . During an inquest in July, Ms Moore spoke about her early meetings with Helena, saying: 'I asked her if she had thoughts about ending her life. She said ""no, not really, I just feel up and down"". At the time I didn't see the risk then.' Her alleged oversight was one of many apparent failings in the lead up to Helena's death. The teenager was academically very able and gifted in sports and music, playing hockey and also attending the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. In the months before her suicide she had become depressed after splitting up with a boyfriend and had self-harmed on several occasions. She had even written letters saying goodbye to her family and friends in the weeks leading up to her death - but they were confiscated by a teacher and later binned. Helena's parents, Enda & Maria Farrell, speak at the end of the inquest into their daughter's death . On January 4, the former Windermere School pupil was found hanged in woodland behind the Castle Green Hotel, Kendal - with Coldplay song The Scientist playing on repeat in the background. July's inquest into the death concluded that Helena died 'as a consequence of her own actions'. However the coroner at the inquest criticised the school nursing system after hearing that Donna Moore had responsibility at the time for the welfare of around 5,000 pupils across five secondary schools and at least 20 primary schools. The CAMHS have also come under heavy criticism for failing to offer Helena an appointment with a social worker until her mother, Maria, called them - despite the case being classed as 'urgent'.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A grieving son has claimed a hospital failing to wash his frail mother for a month and then signed her death certificate with the wrong date. Frank Lynch, 65, has drawn up a list of damning complaints regarding the treatment of his mother, Phyllis Hutchings, at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent. He said his mother, who had dementia, went for four weeks without having her hair washed or receiving a bath while she was on the ward. Phyllis Hutchings (pictured), who had dementia, allegedly went for four weeks without being washed at the Medway Maritime Hospital, in Kent . The hospital has been in special measures after a series of damning Care Quality Commission reports. Last week, it was reported that the hospital's A&E department could be downgraded or even closed if urgent improvements are not made. Mr Lynch said his mother, who served in the Women's Land Army, was not fed properly and was underweight and dehydrated when she died. He said: 'If my mother had been treated correctly and with compassion, I am certain she would still be with us. 'To add insult to injury, after waiting two days for the doctor to sign the death certificate it was wrongly dated.' Mrs Hutchings died aged 89 from bronchial pneumonia, heart disease and dementia on August 12. She had lived in a care home in Sittingbourne, before she was admitted to A&E on July 14 and on the same day, she was transferred to the general Will Adams ward. It was only days before her death  that she was moved to a specially designated ward for dementia patients. Medway Maritime Hospital has been in special measures after damning Care Quality Commission reports . Mr Lynch's wife, Sue, 55, a receptionist in a doctors' surgery, said: 'She was treated very well in A&E, but as soon as she was moved to the Will Adams ward it went downhill. 'It was heartbreaking and degrading. 'Nobody seemed to know what was wrong with her and what her treatment should be. 'I know they are short-staffed but there should always be somebody in charge who knows what's going on.' Medway NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said: 'We are fully aware of Mr Lynch's concerns around his mother's care during her stay at Medway Maritime Hospital. 'The concerns are being looked at with the individuals and teams involved in Mrs Hutchings' care and we will be arranging a meeting with Mr Lynch to discuss the matter in more detail.'","Frank Lynch, 65, has made a list of complaints about the treatment of his mother, Phyllis Hutchings, at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . He was 'ridiculed' by his friends when he started a business  that lovingly restored a car that was derided by motorists across Europe. But now Tony Shields has definitely had the last laugh. His Bradford-based company, which revamps old Citroen 2CVs - once the butt of jokes in the motor industry - is now proving so popular it is struggling to keep up with demand. Owner of 2CV City, Tony Shields (pictured) turns old wrecks back into new 2CVs and also develops chassis . The 2CV City company relocated from Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire to a new workshop in Low Moor, Bradford and business is booming . Officially unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in 1948,  the economy car was produced up until 1990 . Mr Shields, of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, said in a recent order that 30 of the car's chassis had been sent to its home country, France, in one shipment alone. The 2CV City company relocated from Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire to a new workshop in Low Moor, Bradford, and business is booming. At its new home, it turns old wrecks back into new cars and also develops new chassis. It sells the iconic French-made cars for up to £12,000. The company also rebuilds the Citroen H Van. Mr Shields employs seven staff and even drives trailer loads of the chassis to customers in France himself. The 2CV City company, in Bradford, has seen turnover go up by about 40 per cent in the last three to four years . Citreon 2CVs are one of the world's quirkiest cars, sometimes referred to as the 'upside down umbrella' He said: 'Over the last three or four years turnover has gone up by about 40 per cent. 'We make the chassis because they have a tendency to rust and we usually sell about 200 a year with a large number of them going to France. 'They still make the original style chassis over there but ours are almost half the price. 'A lot of people are reliving their youth and they are looking at classic cars and thinking ""let's go back to what we had years ago"". 'The beauty of the 2CV is that it's very simplistic with no electronics and people can do all the maintenance themselves.' There are seven staff (including the one pictured) that work on revamping the 2CV cars . Over its 42-year production run, the car was a great commercial success - around 5million units were sold . Citreon 2CVs are one of the world's quirkiest cars, sometimes referred to as the 'upside down umbrella'. Conceived before the war, to carry a farmer's eggs across a rough field, nearly 5 million of the 'ugly ducks' were sold. The last of the quirky little French cars left British showrooms in 1990 costing £4,552 on the road. It has since become a French icon - and for that it has a certain company in Yorkshire to thank. The prototype for the Citroen 2CV - 'an umbrella on four wheels' - dates back to the 1930s' design by engineer Pierre-Jules Boulanger. Officially unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in 1948, the name is an abbreviation of 'deux chevaux vapeur' - which translates as 'two steam horses'. Regarded as a simple, reliable vehicle, the economy car was produced by the French manufacturer up until 1990. It was famously heralded as being able to be driven across a ploughed field without breaking the eggs it was carrying. Over its 42-year production run, the car was a great commercial success - around 5million units were sold, including just over a million vans. In 1981, a yellow 2CV was driven by James Bond in the film For Your Eyes Only, including a chase sequence through a Spanish olive farm. From 1988 onwards, production took place in Portugal rather than France. This continued for two years until 2CV production halted.","A company that revamps old Citroen 2CVs, an iconic French car, is booming .

While it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for the next 40, there is some element of truth to weather patterns continuing. By this point in the summer, the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of August. The jet stream is a fast-flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere. It tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the south. If it is sitting to the north of the UK, then warm air tends to invade from the south, usually associated with high pressure building in from the Azores, leading to fine and settled weather for the British Isles. However, should the jet stream sit across the UK or to the south, then cooler air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across the country from the Atlantic, leading to unsettled weather. So far, the jet stream is pointing directly towards the British Isles, indicating unsettled weather.","British folklore states that if it rains on St Swithun's Day then it will continue to do so for another 40 days .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A sheep has sold for a staggering £152,000 at a livestock auction in Scotland - almost double the price of a Porsche. The eight-month old Texel ram, called Vicious Sid, is now the second most expensive sheep ever sold in the UK. Texels, originally from the island of Texel in the Netherlands, are currently the most popular sheep for breeding in the UK because of the quality of the meat. The eight-month old Texel lamb, called Vicious Sid, is the second most expensive sheep ever sold in the UK . Robert Cockburn's daughter, Jasmine, 2, says goodbye to Sid, sold to a three-way consortium for £152,000 . Sid was sold by shepherd Robert Cockburn, from Crieff in Perthshire, to a three-way consortium which includes well-known breeders Charlie Boden, the Campbell family   and the Blackwood family. They paid £145,000 guineas - or just over £152,000 - at the Scottish National Texel sale at Lanark Market on Thursday and will now use his semen to artificially inseminate ewes. In keeping with tradition, the majority of farm livestock, including horses, are still sold in guineas at markets. A guinea is worth about £1.05p. Sid was sold at the Scottish National Texel sale at Lanark Market (pictured) on Thursday . Mr Cockburn is a shepherd at the well-known Blackface sheep flock at Connachan, near Crieff, but sheep are also his paying hobby. He has 25 ewes in his Knap flock of Texels which he shares with girlfriend Dianne Wood. Their daughter Jasmine, 2, was at Lanark to witness the memorable occasion and their second child is due in October. After the sale of Sid, Mr Cockburn said: 'I knew it was a good one, but I didn't think it would make that price.' Weighing around 100 Kgs, Sid is worth approximately £1,500 a kilo. Ayrshire breeder Alan Blackwood, 27, was part of the three-way consortium that purchased the lamb. He said: 'He is just completely different and has a real class about him. He has a presence around him that is hard to explain. He is just a head and shoulders above the rest, with so much character. 'I knew as soon as I saw him on show that he would be the best one I would see.' Mr Blackwood said the prized lamb would be transported to Edinburgh where his semen would be frozen and stored as back-up 'in case anything happened to him'. He will them be shared with the consortium and used to artificially inseminate ewes. Sid was sold at  the high price because of his pedigree and the prospect that he will father more sheep like him . Sid is believed to be second most expensive sheep ever bought in the UK. The average cost of a lamb in the UK is around £100 - but top quality rams used for breeding fetch much more. The highest sum ever achieved for a sheep is £231,000 (or 220,000 guineas), paid by Jimmy Douglas for the eight-month-old Texel tup, Deveronvale Perfection, at Lanark market, in August 2009. It was reported in September 2011 that a single Dolan sheep - a rare breed of only about 1000 - was up for sale in China. The highest bid received was for £14 million yuan (£1.4 million), but no sale was agreed. Top Dolan sheep can secure as much as 300,000 yuan (£30,300) for one dose of semen.","The eight-month old Texel ram is the second most expensive sheep in UK .

Tristan Green, 18, from Prettygate in Colchester, broke his neck and was paralysed from the chest down. He is expected to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. His father, James, 38, said: 'Unless there is a complete miracle, he will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.' Tristan Green, 18, from Colchester, broke his neck and was paralysed from the chest down after he jumped into a shallow pool only four feet deep at a friend's house . He was playing at the swimming pool with his girlfriend, Lauren Faulkner, 18, (pictured) who has been visiting him regularly at Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, since the accident . He told the Colchester Gazette: 'I look at pictures of me and him playing football and break down. 'We have had some hope because he wiggled his left toe and moved his right foot but it could be 18 months before we know the full effects. 'We need to be supportive for him to get through this.' Mr Green Jnr, was a former pupil at Colchester's Alderman Blaxill School and wanted to get on a plumbing and electrical course at the time of the accident. He has two brothers, Scott, 25, and Harvey, two, and two sisters, Zoe, 23, and Jodie, 22. The Colchester teenager (pictured with his father, James) had two six-hour operations on his neck and was put under sedation for a fortnight. He has remained in the neurological critical care unit . Mr Green Jnr was playing at a friend's swimming pool with his girlfriend, Lauren Faulkner, in Colchester, when he sustained the catastrophic injuries on July, 26. His mother, Dawn, said he stood on the edge of the swimming pool and jumped in with his palms stretched out together in a forward motion. She said: 'He then floated to the top of the water. 'Lauren thought he was just messing around. He was laying with one arm out, facing down in the water and she saw him turn his head. 'She realised something was wrong and got into the pool herself and spun him over onto his front. 'He said to Lauren he couldn't move.' Tristan Green with his grandmother in Addenbrooke's Hospital  (left) and before the accident (right) Miss Faulkner, her friend and her friend's mother then moved him on to a metal garden chair. She then called Mr Green Snr, who spotted a lump on the back of Tristan's head and called an ambulance. Paramedics  needed firefighters to cut him out of the chair so they could put him on a spine board. He was then flown to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where he underwent a series of scans and tests. He remained conscious throughout. Two days later, he underwent a six-hour operation on his neck and had another one the next day. He was put under sedation for a fortnight and has remained in the neurological critical care unit since the accident. He is hooked up to a ventilator and is having to learn how to breathe independently again. He still has a tracheostomy to create an opening in his windpipe to help him breathe. At present, he is communicating by lip reading and making a clicking noise with his mouth to call for nurses. Tristan Green, pictured with his grandfather.

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . Democratic lawmakers amped up their criticisms of President Barack Obama this week, openly expressing irritation with the president's leadership style and his tendency to hold members of his own political party at arm's length. Multiple Democratic senators told the New York Times that they not only lack a personal relationship with the president, who was once a senator himself, they've rarely had the opportunity to talk to him one on one throughout the course of his presidency. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, now in her second term, summed up the president's attitude toward his former colleagues this way: 'For him, eating his spinach is schmoozing with elected officials. 'This is not something that he loves. He wasn’t that kind of senator.' Loner: Democratic lawmakers are irked that President Barack Obama doesn't work more closely with them . Republicans inside and outside of Congress have expressed annoyance with Obama throughout his second term over what they perceive as a disinterest in governing and the politicking that goes with it. But the president's political allies have also begun coming forward with their own lists of grievances toward Obama, some of which sound similar to their counterparts across the aisle. 'Talented guy but no leader,' a former member of Congress who is now a lobbyist told the National Journal's Ron Fournier a couple month's ago. 'If he could govern half as well as he campaigns, he'd be a good-to-great president,' the former lawmaker said. 'He's bored and tired of being president,' a current Democratic lawmaker told Fournier. On several occasions in recent months the president has made major policy decisions without consulting Congress, and, more importantly to Democrats, his party's leadership. The most egregious example dates back to late May, when Obama secretly swapped five Taliban commanders being held at Guantanamo Bay for the safe return of Bowe Bergdahl, an Army private who was abducted by the Taliban five years ago in Afghanistan. The White House is legally required to inform Congress 30 before it releases prisoners from Gitmo of its intentions. The Obama administration ignored the law to make the Bergdahl trade, however, and notified members hours beforehand or not at all. 'Even I have had enough,' a powerful Democrat in Washington told Fournier after the terror trade. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told The Hill last week that Obama's penchant for acting alone has become a source of irritation for Democrats. 'Not being consulted ahead of time — that just makes people crazy,' the Arizona congressman said. 'Let us know ahead of time. Call us in when you're developing something so we can give you our ground-level reality check about how this is going to work.' Former NBA basketball player Alonzo Mourning, left, and President Barack Obama converse while golfing at Farm Neck Golf Club, in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, on Sunday during Obama's vacation on Martha's Vineyard island. Obama took close friends and former athletes golfing with him during the trip but no lawmakers . The previous Sunday President Obama played with businessman Glen Hutchins. As of this week, Obama has played 189 games of golf. And only twice has he played with lawmakers . Obama's behavior is baffling, Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly told The Hill. 'It's hard for us to fathom; I mean, is it just lack of full staffing and resources? [Is it] professional commitment? Is it a disdain for the legislative branch? I mean, what is it?' Connolly wondered. 'People like me want to be allies — I mean, I am an ally,' he continued. 'So work with us, reach out to us; you know, we're not the enemy.' Obama may not view Congress as the 'enemy,' but he certainly doesn't view most members of the legislative body as his friends. The . president rarely takes lawmakers on his golfing trips or invites . them over to the White House outside of big group events. Obama has only golfed with lawmakers twice in the 189 times he's been on the course since taking office and only one of those times did he bring a Democrat - Sen. Mark Udall, Golf Digest's top-ranked golfer in Congress in 2011. 'The White House has something in common with the rest of America, and that is disdain for Congress,' McCaskill said. 'It is hard to blame them.' The White House says the president has had Democrats over to the White House for meetings 18 times this year, but Richard Blumenthal, a Senator from Connecticut who was elected in 2010, told the Times that he 'can count them on both hands' the number of times he has been to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since he moved to Washington. And all of those visits were for formal events, he said.'It’s more the interaction that I think has been somewhat lacking — the personal,' he noted. Asked by the Times to describe his relationship with Obama, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said: 'It’s fairly nonexistent. There’s not much of a relationship. 'Maybe we wanted something different,' Manchin said of his party's expectations of Obama. 'But it kind of is what it is.' Virginia Rep. Jim Moran tried to explain Democratic lawmakers' frustrations with Obama in terms of football. 'Certainly, [former Democratic president] Bill Clinton saw us as his offensive line, and so he attended to the nurturing of his offensive line,' Moran told the Hill. 'And I don't think this president, this quarterback, invests all that much time and effort into the care and feeding of his offensive line. You can still win,' Moran pointed out. 'It just makes it a little more difficult.' 'In order to work with people, you need to establish the relationship first before you ask for something,' Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats told the Times. 'And I think one of the things the White House has not done well and the president has not done well is the simple idea of establishing relationships before there is a crisis.' Manchin said the White House may want to rethink its strategy for dealing with lawmakers moving forward if the president wants to accomplish more items on his legislative agenda. 'Maybe if something isn’t working, you’d say, ""What can I do better?"" ' the Democratic Senator said.","Members of Obama's own political party feel isolated from the president .
They say he's made little effort to build personal relationships with them .
Obama has been golfing 189 times since taking office but has only taken lawmakers with him twice .

'His behaviour fully revealed once again the U.S. inveterate nature as a hypocrite who has deceived and mocked mankind with all sorts of gimmicks,' the spokesman said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. South Korean and U.S. officials often criticise the North's critical language but stop short of similar rhetoric against North Korean leaders. However conservative activists in South Korea frequently use images depicting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a pig in anti-Pyongyang rallies.

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . President Barack Obama spent nearly five hours dining at the Washington, D.C. home of longtime friend and White House assistant chef Sam Kass on Monday night. Usually, Kass, the president's senior policy adviser for nutrition, cooks dinner for the first family at the White House. But yesterday the president went to his aide's home for dinner instead. The two were joined for dinner by the president's deputy chief of staff, Anita Breckenridge. First Lady Michelle Obama is still on Martha's Vineyard. She did not accompany the president and their daughter Malia back to Washington on Sunday evening. President Barack Obama attends a meeting with members of the National Security Council on Monday at the White House. Obama came back to D.C. from his vacation in Martha's Vineyard early Monday morning for two days of meetings. He'll return to the Massachusetts island this evening . Last night President Obama dined at the House of White House Assistant Chef Sam Kass. Kass, pictured here with Obama at the Mid Pacific Country Club on New Years Day in Lanikai, Hawaii, is a longtime friend of the first family . The White House provided no additional details on Obama's dinner last night, and the press never saw the president enter or exit Kass' building. Kass and the Obama family are close, having known each other from their days in Chicago, Illinois. Kass's family lived in the same neighborhood as the Obamas, and his father taught Malia's fifth-grade class. A Vogue profile on Kass and his fiancee, MSNBC host Alex Wagner, published earlier this year said a young Kass began cooking for the Obamas when Barack was running for president while serving in the U.S. Senate in Washington and Michelle and the girls were still living in Chicago. When the Obama family moved to Washington, Kass did, too, taking a job as assistant chef at the White House and later food initiative coordinator. While the White House chef handles formal dinners for the president, Kass serves as the Obama family's personal cook. He is also the executive director of the first lady's Let's Move! program. Kass and President Barack Obama are close personal friends as well and regularly golf together. They also known to frequently play basketball and pool against each other at the White House. 'He is a . close enough friend that he’s almost a family member,' Richard Wolffe, a . friend of Kass and the author of three books about the Obamas, told . Vogue. The president spent most of yesterday in meetings at the White House, then made a live statement on the fighting in Iraq and Ferguson, Missouri, before ducking out to visit Kass. Obama sat in on meetings at the White House again today and plans to return to Martha's Vineyard tonight. He'll arrive back at his vacation spot just in time for dinner.","Kass usually cooks for the first family at the White House, but yesterday the president went to his aide's home to eat .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Hillary Clinton does not draw a salary for her work at the Clinton Foundation, 'a source close to Clinton' divulged yesterday, nor does the organization pay the salaries of Hillary's entourage. The disclosure comes as a Republican . opposition research outfit pressures the Clinton Foundation to provide . assurances that it is not directly or indirectly helping to lay the . groundwork for Hillary's presumed 2016 presidential run. Hillary's staff consists of approximately seven aides, including Huma Abedin – disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner's wife – who are reportedly responsible for managing her paid speaking . gigs and helping her promote her memoir Hard Choices, which . came out last month. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Cui bono?': It's unclear whether Hillary's nascent presidential campaign benefits from the speaking feed donated to her family foundation when she and daughter Chelsea make public appearances . Huma Abedin, a longtime Hillary aide who worked with her at the State Department and is now her closest confidante at the Clinton Foundation, is a likely campaign spokeswoman if and when Clinton runs for president . Though they . work out of Hillary's office at the Clinton Foundation, they are not . employed by the nonprofit, an anonymous source reportedly told Business Insider. 'The Secretary's personal staff is paid for by her personally,' the source said. It's common practice for campaign aides to be rewarded with government positions after a job well done. And it's no surprise the Clintons would hire trusted aides to manage their nonprofit organization. But Republican political groups like America Rising PAC and the Republican National Committee are questioning the whether foundation staff are gearing up to join Hillary's 2016 presidential campaign. The Clinton Foundation website lists the names and biographies of 19 staffers on the foundation's leadership team, of whom half acknowledge their political backgrounds. In their bios, five members of the leadership team mention working on Hillary's failed presidential campaign, three others say they've worked for Hillary or Bill in some other capacity when the Clintons served as elected officials and another employee acknowledges working for Obama. America Rising wants the Clinton Foundation to make public a full list of staff or paid consultants who worked for the Clinton in the past or have worked for Obama or the Democratic Party and for both Hillary and Bill to come clean about which speaking fees they've donated to the Clinton Foundation in 2013 and 2014. Hillary recently said she donates all the money given to her by universities for appearances but has provided no proof to substantiate her claim. America Rising also requested a list of travel expenses for Bill, Hillary and Chelsea and a document outlining the costs for the Clinton Global Initiative. A 2013 review of the Clinton Foundation's . ax documents completed by the New York Post found that the organization . spent $50 million throughout the previous decade on travel, and America Rising is curious to know how much of that went toward personal travel for the Clinton family. In an email to reporters on Monday, . America Rising PAC Executive Director Tim Miller said Hillary's . assertion that she passes on checks from universities to the foundation . opened 'the door to questions about just how that foundation is spending . money.' Clinton will need as much staff support as she can get if she runs for president, in part to deflect and diffuse controversies -- like the 2012 Benghazi terror attack -- that continue to dog her . 'In the . past, the Clinton Foundation has spent millions on opulent travel and . lodging for her family, financed glitzy, celebrity-fueled donor events . and paid key Democratic aides who would likely play key roles in her . presidential campaign,' he said. 'For Americans to credibly believe these speaking . fees are being donated to charitable endeavors, the foundation must be . transparent about how and where it has spent its millions since Hillary . Clinton joined last year.' America Rising's concerns that the Clinton Foundation may be serving as the unofficial home for Hillary's unannounced presidential campaign stem from a 2011 internal review of the foundation that cited concerns about perceived and real conflicts of interest within the organization's hierarchy. The Republican PAC also points to the review and a 2013 article from the New York Times that suggested that foundation could 'serve as a base for [Hillary] to home in on issues and to build up a stable . of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political . campaign' as evidence that its charges are not unfounded. The same New York Times article notes that Hillary brought a staff of approximately seven people with her to the foundation when she left the State Department last year, including Abedin, who has been spotted with Hillary frequently throughout her Hard Choices book tour. A spokesman for Chelsea Clinton confirmed to the New York Times on Wednesday that the former first daughter is not paid by the Clinton Foundation either, despite holding the role of Vice Chair and contributing a significant amount of time to helping manage her family's charity. Bill Clinton is yet to disclose personally or through a representative whether he receives a paycheck from the organization on top of the millions he earns annually in speaking fees.","The Clinton Foundation website lists the .

"By . Reuters . Female twin soccer players at the University of Mexico have dropped out of the school after one of the teens was hospitalized from drinking alcohol during a hazing incident. Sisters Danielle and Devin Scelsi, from Trabuco Canyon, California, pulled out of the school following Sunday night's incident. The University of New Mexico has canceled the first match of the women's soccer team's season this week after a hazing incident that left a teenager in hospital. University officials said heavy drinking was involved but they rejected local media reports that Sunday night's incident involved players being made to strip, or even being sprayed with urine. Twins Danielle (pictured right) and Devin Scelsi (left) left the University of New Mexico following a drinking incident during hazing rituals with the soccer team.  Devin reportedly had to be hospitalized on Sunday because she had trouble breathing . The two fraternal twin sisters, pictured with an unknown man, dropped out of the school after they were brutally hazed . The OC Weekly reported that Danielle Scelsi called campus police to report her 18-year-old sister Devin was struggling to breathe and appeared to be vomiting after drinking. Officers found two other teens in the apartment with the teen sisters who also seemed drunk. Devin Scelsi was taken to a hospital and another 18-year-old was taken to a separate center. Two days after the incident, the sisters had left the school, the OC Weekly reported. Their mother Dawn Scelsi told KTLA her freshman daughters were brutally hazed by older members of the team. She said that they had been playing soccer since the age of four and that was all they wanted to do. They were now focused on their future education, the mom added. Two students have left UNM as a result of the initiations, the team's coach confirmed on Wednesday. The school said the UNM athletics department had let down its players. 'We failed the young women of our soccer program who did not understand the seriousness of hazing,' UNM athletic director Paul Krebs told a news conference in Albuquerque. 'These are good women, but they damaged the reputation of the university, the women's soccer program, and themselves.' Krebs said an ongoing probe has revealed that the majority of the team's players were consuming alcohol at more than one off-campus location, but that none of them were forced to drink. University of New Mexico vice president of athletics Paul Krebs (left) and women's head soccer coach Kit Vela speak to reporters on Wednesday after canceling the first match of the season following a hazing incident that left a teenager in hospital . A report by UNM campus police said officers responding to a 911 call took one 18-year-old player to hospital who was extremely intoxicated and had trouble breathing. A second intoxicated 18-year-old, who was having trouble standing, was not transported, police said. Krebs said that while the investigation continues, Friday's season opener against Texas Tech in the Mountain West Conference has been canceled, resulting in a $5,000 fine for UNM. 'We are also assessing what our coaches did and didn't know (about the incident),' Krebs told reporters. Kit Vela, the soccer team's coach, sat alongside him and appeared visibly distressed. 'As a mother, I am upset and angered over what happened,' she said, adding that the teenager who went to hospital was released on Monday. Vela said the player and her sister, who was also on the team, have since left the university. A soccer match scheduled between UNM and Texas Tech this Friday has been canceled resulting in a $5,000 fine for the New Mexico school.

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . A rugby league player has told how a heavy tackle left him in pain - only to be diagnosed with a broken neck three days later. Wests Tigers player Keith Lulia walked off the field after picking up what he thought was a minor injury during a game against the North Queensland earlier this month - but now may never play again. The life changing moment occurred when Lulia was going in to make a cover tackle on Kane Linnett on the night the Tigers experienced a 64-6 annihilation by the Cowboys in Townsville. Aware of how lucky he is, the utility back is remaining positive about the prospect of ever playing again after his neck broke from the pressure of the top of his head colliding with Linnet’s hip. Kieth Lulia walked off the field in a match against the Cowboys two weeks ago without realising he had just broken his neck . Lulia remains positive about the prospect of ever being able to play football again . 'I am trying to stay positive but you never know what is around the corner,'  Lulia told The Daily Telegraph. 'You see players go out there and put their bodies on the line with no protection like they have in NFL. It is a very tough game.' The doctors informed Lulia of how fortunate he was due to the impact of the collision. 'I was actually very lucky to walk off,' he said. His neck was sore the day after the clash, which he thought was just muscular, but then Lulia became suspicious a few days later when the pain hadn't alleviated. 'I hadn’t done any running because if I even tried to jog the jolting just gave me a lot of pain,' he said. 'And I couldn’t train anyway without passing the cog test (which players are obliged to take after suffering concussion). Lulia's neck was sore the day after the clash, which he thought was just muscular, but then became suspicious a few days later when the pain hadn't alleviated . Lulia asked for further tests to be done after he failed the cog test twice. 'So he sent me for a scan and it showed there was a break, a clean break,' he said. He said he knows how blessed he is to still have movement in his neck. 'I am just lucky that so far there is no nerve damage and hopeful it heals up 100 per cent,' he said. 'It is just the pain I have to deal with at the moment.'

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Chinese police are trying to dissect a bizarre mystery after a meat cleaver was found jammed into a block of flats nearly 13 floors up. Baffled officers are being driven up the wall trying to work out how the huge knife got there, nearly 150ft above the ground, as it is not close to any windows. The cleaver was discovered by residents of the apartment block in Chengdu, Sichuan province, embedded in the outer wall between the 12th and 13th floors. Knife block: Chinese police cannot figure out how the meat cleaver got jammed so high up the building . Slice of luck: The blade is not near any windows and did not harm anyone in the process of getting there . Threat: Police believe that the act could have been done to send a message to someone in the block . It has not harmed anyone, but has left residents scared about what it could mean. 'It's really creepy. No-one knows how it got there and now we're all afraid to sit on or balconies or leave our windows open,' said resident Chan Juan Ts'ai. 'We just woke up one morning and it was there.' Police hired a local steeplejack to abseil down the building to remove it from the wall. A police spokesman said: 'It appears no-one saw it happen so we're appealing for anyone who knows anything about this to come forward. 'We doubt that someone on a floor above innocently dropped the knife which went over their balcony or out of a kitchen window. Given that it was hurled in the wall with some force that seems unlikely. 'More likely is we could be dealing with someone who is deliberately trying to disturb their neighbours or deliver some kind of threat. 'We are watching the block and the knife is being tested for fingerprints and other forensic evidence.'","Residents of Chengdu block afraid to use their balconies or open windows .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A Chinese woman claims to have been left with burn marks on her face from her iPhone 5S, which have still not healed a month later. Su Jing, 31, from the city of Zhuzhou in south-eastern China’s Hunan Province, was having a long phone conversation with her boyfriend when she noticed the device had got very hot and felt some discomfort on her face. She thought the pain was only temporary, but the marks still remain a month on. Su Jing claims she received the burn marks after a telephone conversation left her iPhone 5S extremely hot . Ms Jing says she only noticed the burn, which is across the left side of her face, when a colleague pointed it out to her at work. iPhone 5S: The device which has left Ms Jing with an electrical burn . She went to the doctors and was told she had received an electrical burn, and although not life-threatening, she was advised to visit specialists at a hospital instead. Ms Jing said she called customer service in China about the apparent defect in the phone, to which she was told the head office would be contacted about taking her phone in for repairs. This is the latest in a number of incidents which have left people with nasty burns from their iPhones. Earlier this month 18-year-old Jake Parker was scarred for life after he fell asleep on his iPhone 5 - which then burnt a two-inch hole into his arm. And in February, a teenage girl was left with second degree burns caught fire while in her back pocket at school. The 14-year-old had just arrived for her French class at a middle school in Kennebunk, Maine, when the device spontaneously set alight and burnt her thigh and back. In China, Apple leases its retailer rights to third-party vendors, which makes it difficult to find the party directly responsible in Ms Jin's case.

"By . Laura Cox . They are the tigers who came to tea - then stayed for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sumatran cubs Spot and Stripe found a home with animal expert and zoo keeper Giles Clark after they were born at the Australia Zoo in Queensland. There are less than 500 Sumatran tigers . left in the wild, so zoo breeding programmes are essential in preserving the species. A third of Sumatran cubs born in captivity don't make it to adulthood, so to ensure their survival, Giles agreed to give them round the clock care at home for the first few months of their lives. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sumatran cubs Spot and Stripe found a home with the Clark family, Mr and Mrs Clark pictured here with Spot and Stripe and children Alicia, 16, and Kynan, eight . It makes for an unusual family album, which can be seen here for the first time. From riding a skateboard to playing with trucks in a sandpit, Spot and Stripe adapted to a remarkably human lifestyle during their time living with the Clarks. They had their own purpose-built pool for when their thick coats made the heat unbearable, while sofas and beds became free-range for a sleepy cub wanting a cuddle with Mr Clark’s children: Alicia, 16, and Kynan, eight. And they would even climb on to their beds where they would blend in among the soft toys. Giles took the cubs into his care after they were born at an Australian Zoo in Queensland . The mischievous cubs learned to interact with the family - and even played with the children's toys, their favourite being the skateboard . Mr Clark, 36, a zookeeper and tiger enthusiast and a ‘tiger daddy’ according to his wife Ceri, 37, grew up in Middlesex, England. He fell in love with the big cat species as a 16-year-old boy during a trip to a British zoo. Now, having followed his dream to Australia, the real-life Tiger Man works at Australia Zoo, where can be found playing with fully-grown adult big cats or taking them on walks in the nearby bush. Mr Clark believes that encouraging humans to interact with wild animals will make them more likely to want to help save rare species from extinction. The tigers have become a permanent fixture in the Clark family home, blending in with their son's soft toys . Just like children, the cubs loved playing with the toy digger in the garden . And so naturally, when resident tiger Kaitlin gave birth to her cubs it was Mr Clark who volunteered to take two of them home. Spot and Stripe, so called because of their markings, are two of the most critically endangered tigers in the world. But safely within the walls of the Clarks' home, they quickly settled in, forming close bonds with the family and exploring the house and its surroundings like a pair of curious toddlers. Mr Clark had to take on the role of their mother and provide round-the-clock care for his charges. He said: ‘As with any baby, I had to make sure that everything was washed and sterile. And not just bottles – with the number of towels you’re going through, it felt like the washing machine was going constantly. I was more exhausted than when my son was a baby. Giles has to act as a mother to the two young cubs: 'You never, ever forget in those first couple of months how dependent they are. Everything you do has an impact on them,' he explains . Giles says by having the cubs at home, they are able to care for them in ways that a zoo can't, such as building them a custom-made pool . 'Naturally mum would lick them to stimulate them to go to the toilet, so I had to replicate that with my hand. You never, ever forget in those first couple of months how dependent they are. Everything you do has an impact on them.' The unique family set-up mirrors that depicted in the children's book The Tiger Who Came to Tea by Judith Kerr, which is about a girl called Sophie, her mother, and a tiger who interrupts their afternoon tea. Spot and Stripe and the Clark appear in a new BBC2 documentary called Tigers About the House that airs tonight on BBC2. Despite their at-home comforts, these tigers are no pets and survive on a diet of raw meat . The tigers have learnt to live alongside the other family animals, including Caesar the dog . The tiger cubs obviously feel completely at home with the Clarks who regularly find them prowling the work surfaces . It follows their remarkable upbringing at Mr Clark's suburban Australian home, which is already rather full with two children, two dogs - Ruby, a black Labrador cross and a caramel-coloured mastiff cross named Caesar - and Mrs Snakey, a pet snake. Giles believes that by forming a relationship with the tigers he is able to give them a much better quality of life . Spot and Stripe are two of the most critically endangered tigers in the world . He told the Radio Times: 'By forming this relationship - I call it a friendship - with our animals, we're able to give them a much better quality of life. They’re not stressed or frustrated like tigers you might see in other facilities. 'We do a variety of things with our cats that normally just wouldn’t be possible in captivity. We even play with them in a purpose-built pool. We can only do that by having a really strong bond, and you need to establish that when they're very little.'

"By . Deborah Arthurs . They say that true love is hard to find. But as it is revealed that millions of us have actually been struck down by Cupid's arrow after just one glance, perhaps in reality it is not as hard as previously thought. A new study has found that a third of us have fallen in love at first sight - suggesting that we are still a nation of romantics. Sadly much of this love remains unspoken, with one in six Brits falling head over heels for a work colleague but keeping their feelings under wraps. And 11 per cent of men even confess losing their heart to a friend’s wife or girlfriend, but never letting on. Love at first sight? A third of us say we have been struck down by Cupid's arrow at first glance, a new study has revealed . The research found that in an age of social networking internet dating we still yearn for traditional romantic gestures such as a handwritten love letter. And 60 per cent of Brits have never had a one night stand as they hold out for Mr or Mrs Right. Unfortunately, there is often a difference between what we want and what we get, the study by flower delivery company Interflora revealed. While 41 per cent of women insist a handwritten card or letter is the way to their heart, men are more likely to profess their undying love by text. One in five British men (19 per cent) have said ‘I love you’ by SMS, compared to just 17 per cent who have actually written it in a letter. One in five (20 per cent) believe love should be declared with flowers, while 10 per cent say a poem is most romantic. The research into modern relationships, conducted in the run up to Valentine’s Day, found the notion of love at first sight is far from dying out. Not only do 31 per cent say they’ve been struck by Cupid’s arrow, but this rises to 37 per cent among those aged 55 and over. Romantics: We still yearn for traditional romantic gestures such as a handwritten love letter, the study found . More than a third of us - 38 per cent - have fallen in love at work, but 16 per cent have felt unable to tell the object of their affection. And 11 per cent of men admit having carried a torch for a friend’s wife or partner. Psychologist Dr Gayle Brewer, of the University of Central Lancashire, said: 'It seems a lot of people spend time thinking about being a relationship with someone other than their partner. 'It’s very easy to romanticise what a relationship could be like. 'Perhaps it’s not surprising we might fall for people we work with as we see them daily and we usually see them on their best behaviour. 'We may also see friend’s partners when they are at their best - while out, dressed up and sociable, perhaps making an effort to be more humorous. 'But of course we all worry about the ramifications of falling for someone in the workplace, such as seeing them every day if we are rejected. 'With the partner of a friend or family member the ramifications could be even greater. 'This type of undeclared love could be upsetting and prevent a person from moving on and finding true happiness.' The study, of 2,000 people, found that 12 per cent have sent a Valentine’s card or gift to someone other than their partner while in a relationship. In addition, six per cent of men confess to sending themselves one just to make their wife or girlfriend jealous. In contrast, 16 per cent of women have sent a card to a friend to cheer them up. Michael Barringer, Marketing Director at Interflora, said: 'Technology plays an increasing role in the way we communicate but when it comes to saying ""I love you"" we prefer loved ones to take the traditional approach. 'Huge numbers meet through dating sites and use new media but it’s reassuring to hear we love to receive a handwritten note and still fall in love at first sight. 'It indicates we are a nation of romantics, even though the research suggests many have not yet felt able to tell the object of their desire how they really feel. 'It’s also fascinating to see how many people send Valentine’s cards and gifts to people other than their partners, such as to cheer up a friend.'","Study finds 33% of Brits have been struck by Cupid's arrow at first glance .

"By . Tamara Abraham . The Price is NOT Right: Brandi Cochran could lose the $7.7million that she won last year after claiming she was discriminated over her pregnancy . A former model for The Price Is Right could lose the $7.7million that she won last year after claiming she was discriminated over her 2008 pregnancy, and wrongfully terminated. Brandi Cochran, 42, who appeared on the show for seven years, was awarded the multi-million-dollar sum in punitive . damages last November following a high-profile legal battle with The Price Is Right Productions and  producers FremantleMedia North America. But now the case is going back to trial after a Los Angeles Superior Court judge decreed yesterday that there were 'bad jury instructions'. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the judge in last year's trial failed to tell the jury that the discrimination in question had to be a ""substantial"" motivation factor, despite a request to do so from the defendants. The news comes just a week after the California Supreme Court issued a new ruling that discrimination must be a substantial motivating factor in mixed motive cases. Judge Kevin Brazile wrote in yesterday's ruling: 'The instruction error cannot be considered harmless. Of central importance to the case was the weight . given to discriminatory intent and whether that intent need only be of a . mere motivating factor or a substantial factor. 'Given this central . dispute, the failure to give the proper instruction regarding . substantial factor cannot be considered harmless, and a new trial must . be granted.' Ms Cochran appeared on The Price Is Right for seven years using her maiden name, Brandi Sherwood, alongside former host Bob Barker and current host Drew Carey. In the trial last year, Ms Cochran claimed she got pregnant in . 2007 but couldn’t tell anyone at work as she was so scared of losing her . job and, due to the severe stress, ‘that pregnancy ended in a . miscarriage’. According to Us Magazine, one producer even told Ms Cochran that losing this pregnancy was ‘nature's way of getting rid of a bad baby.’ Professional posing: Ms Cochran, pictured with fellow models Lanisha Cole (center) and Rachel Reynolds (right) in 2008, appeared on The Price Is Right for seven years . When . she got pregnant again, with twins, in late 2008, it is claimed that producers . subjected her to cruel insults. When she walked past the one . producer he allegedly scoffed: 'Wide load coming through.' Ms Cochran claims that she was rejected by producers when she sought to return to the show in early 2010. 'They ignored me, for probably about four months, trying to get a direct response about working,' she told KABC. Since the verdict was announced last November, FremantleMedia has launched an appeal. It said in a statement to KABC: 'We . believe the verdict in this case was the result of a flawed process in . which the court, among other things, refused to allow the jury to hear . and consider that 40per cent of our models have been pregnant and other . important evidence to our defense. 'We expect to be fully vindicated after the matter has been reviewed.' All smiles: Ms Cochran (far right), who is professionally known by her maiden name, Brandi Sherwood, pictured with former Price Is Right host Bob Barker in 2003 .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . A mother who was bludgeoned to death and stuffed inside a suitcase in Bali was paid $800,000 in a lawsuit settlement three years ago. Court records show that Sheila von Wiese-Mack and her late husband received the settlement in a lawsuit between the couple and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Around $500,000 of the money went to her husband's estate and was designated for their daughter through an earlier will. But in 2011, a judge allowed Ms von Weise-Mack to pay herself the $500,000 as the estate's 'sole beneficiary', meaning the money did not go to her daughter and suspected killer, Heather Mack. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer seen grinning on a beach before they were suspected of killing Mack's mother and stuffing her corpse inside a suitcase . Ms von Wiese-Mack was found stuffed inside a silver, blood-stained suitcase in the trunk of a taxi outside an upmarket hotel in Bali, Indonesia . It is not clear if the settlement with Royal Caribbean Cruises affected the relationship between von Wiese-Mack and her daughter, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Mack, 19, and her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, 21, are suspected of murder. In Indonesia, naming a suspect is a formal part of the criminal process before they are officially charged. Officials say future charges could include premeditated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of death by firing squad. The American couple also had a disagreement with Ms von Weise-Mack, 62, over who was paying for their hotel rooms, police say. Bali police chief Major General Benny Mokalu said officers had interviewed 19 witnesses, of which some said they overhead a disagreement between the three over who should pay for their accommodation. Chicago police records also show that officers were called 86 times in 10 years to the house where Ms von Wiese-Mack and her daughter once lived. The records indicated that Ms von Wiese-Mack was repeatedly and violently abused by her daughter. However Mr Mokalu said a motive for the crime had not been established. Mother and daughter: An image from happier times shows Mack smiling with her mother . Ms von Weise-Mack's body was found stuffed inside a suitcase in the back of the trunk of taxi outside a hotel in Bali. Police say she was bludgeoned to death with an ashtray and a vase, which both smashed after impacts with her head. The bloodstained shards of glass have fingerprints on them but detectives have not revealed whether they belong to Mack or Schaefer. The FBI have been drafted in to help Indonesian police with their investigations. An Indonesian lawyer appointed to the couple, Haposan Sihombing, said that the suspects were being held under a suicide watch and were still refusing to talk to investigators. Their American attorney, Michael Elkin, said that Mack, 19, is two months pregnant and complained about her treatment in custody. Mack claims that her pregnancy is ectopic and that it is vital she returns home to the U.S. for care. She was seen being taken to the obstetrics and gynecology section of a police hospital in Bali for tests on Friday to find out if her pregnancy is 'outside the womb', a dangerous condition. Police have not revealed the results of any tests. Heather Mack stands at the police district headquarters after she was brought in for questioning in relation to the death of her mother .

"By . Angela Epstein . For the umpteenth time that morning, my phone pinged with yet another incoming message. This time the correspondent was an old university friend who, having heard of my recent bereavement, offered two lines of sympathy on the 'sad loss of my grandmother'. More than a little shocked, I batted back an immediate response, thanking him for his kind words, while also pointing out it was in fact my dear mum who had just passed away. 'Oh, so sorry about that,' spluttered his contrite reply. 'Thinking of you xx'. Then silence. 'The most important woman in my life': Angela with her late mother . I admit, I felt crushed. The death of my mother - the most important woman in my life - dashed off in a careless text message, on a commute to work. In other circumstances, such a mistake might have been funny, but it was gut-wrenching when I was still steeped in grief. However, my friend was by no means alone in choosing to use the likes of texting or social media sites such as Facebook for delivering condolences. I've been receiving messages in this way almost non-stop since losing my lovely mum nearly three weeks ago. And why not? Just do the maths. You hear that an old classmate/former work colleague/past girlfriend/fellow parent from the school run has suffered a family bereavement. In less than a minute you can show that you care without recourse to an awkward phone call, the inconvenience of a visit or the effort of a letter. Believe me I've done it myself, many times. And until now, never felt anything less than, to use text speak, 'gr8' about what I thought was a perfectly acceptable way to express sympathy. Impersonal: Angela says sending a text is not an adequate way to express condolences (posed by model) But now here I am, at the other end of the mobile phone. A woman who has just lost the loveliest of mothers. And I realise just how soulless it is to receive condolences - however well-meant - in short and impersonal, almost glib, one-liners, and often signed off with 'lots of luv xx'. As I squint to read these messages on my phone screen, I've come to understand how this new 'etiquette' has obviated the need for a personal touch, even at a time of dark sorrow and deep distress, allowing well-wishers to appear to be doing 'the right thing' while, in fact, expending no emotional energy at all. 'One friend expressed her . sympathy in a Facebook message and wondered, 'while she was on', if she could have the number of a mutual . work contact' Interestingly, only a handful of those who contacted me this way prefaced their message with an apology at their mode of communication or explained they had no choice but to resort to texts because they were away on holiday. Though, in some cases, it seemed the text was enough to feel they had discharged their duty even after their return. Of course, in the days before social media, if a person wished to express their condolences they'd either have to ring or visit the bereaved - however uncomfortable a prospect that might be - or at the very least send a letter or sympathy card. Those few minutes spent with a pen hovering over a blank page trying to marshal the right words as well as the effort required in going to buy a stamp would be part of the connecting process. But now there's no need to do any of this. Social media has become today's norm, a place to celebrate life's milestones or chew over every nugget of daily routine, and even, it seems, commiserate on the most profound emotional blows. No comfort: Messages can't beat a phone call, handwritten card or visit (posed by model) One 20-something friend expressed her sympathy in one paragraph of a Facebook message and in the next wondered, 'while she was on', if she could have the number of a mutual work contact. As those texts rolled in, the stark limitations of virtual sympathy only served to heighten the impact of the handful of condolence letters and sympathy cards I received. The comfort derived from the loop of every handwritten word was immense. Each one, though often short in length, effortlessly eased into anecdotes about my late mum. One writer remembered how they had been on the same charity committee as Mum, another recalled seeing her regularly at local musical concerts. Treasured chips in the mosaic of a life that had been lived and was now preserved in the memories of those left to mourn and remember. Phone calls were equally gratifying. Even though I didn't always pick up, sometimes because I simply wasn't there, but often by design when the day seemed too dark for small talk, just hearing a human voice curling out of the answering machine was a huge comfort. Only the other day a relative of my husband left a sweet, simple: 'Hi, honey, how are you doing? Have been thinking about you so much. Would love to have a chat. Will try you again.' Delivered by text such a sentiment might well have seemed spare and lifeless. Articulated by a human voice, it bubbled with comforting warmth. The irony is that offering sympathy via the internet and text message isn't, as I’ve discovered, necessarily the easy option since it only makes it more difficult to communicate with the mourner when you do face them in the flesh. One friend of a friend sent me a polite text when she heard my news. When I saw her in person a week later, though, she looked at me with large doleful eyes, but made no reference to what had happened. As if the matter had been dealt with and neatly set aside by her text. She was socially paralysed - and I was left feeling how much easier the moment would have been if we'd made real, human contact first time round. 'I've learnt the hard way not to take what I think is the easy option when it comes to comforting the bereaved' So how did we come to this? I know I share some responsibility for the very culture I now criticise. As a busy working mother, I organise vast tracts of my life by text. Scrolling through the messages I've sent over the past six months I can see all too many examples of what I would have considered noble, thoughtful behaviour at the time. A text to a friend to see how her wisdom teeth operation went, or a Facebook message to an old work contact asking how the new job was going. I didn't think of picking up the phone. Little wonder that a culture has sprouted up which regards this form of communication as the default setting for sympathetic expression. And it's so convenient. There you are, idling in the canned fruit aisle of your local Sainsbury's when a text lands on your phone telling you a mutual friend has lost a parent. It seems 'natural' to ping over a message. You think it shows you care, but the effect can be quite the opposite. I did still receive lots of visitors after Mum passed away - being Jewish it's traditional for mourners to stay at home for a week while well-wishers come to pay their respects and keep you company. Perhaps being surrounded by so many who cared only served to expose the emotional emptiness of the text message as carrier pigeon. Coming to terms with the loss of my mum is tough. You battle with a dull, hard ache in your chest, trying to savour the memories without sinking into sadness. My mum was a wonderful lady. Warm-hearted, kind, a relentless optimist who always tried to see the good in everyone. (She'd doubtless berate me for being critical of those who clearly only meant well in texting me.) But truncating that presence into a crisp text message seems woefully inadequate. It diminishes the brightness of her light and the worthiness of the sender. I've learnt the hard way not to take what I think is the easy option when it comes to comforting the bereaved. Perhaps before tapping on your keyboard, you may well think twice about doing the same.","Angela is mourning the loss of her mother .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Former Governor of Virginia Bob McDonnell has told his and his wife's corruption trial that she was anxious about his election win. Mr McDonnell and his wife were arguing just hours after his 2009 election victory - and he had to calm her down moments before taking a congratulatory phone call from President Obama. The former Governor said that he sensed that his wife was worried about the pressure of living in the public spotlight as first lady the day after he won the vote, and they spoke of Maureen moving out of his mansion and seeking counseling. Former Governor of Virginia Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen are on trial for corruption after being 'showered with $165,000 in gifts and loans' by the CEO of a dietary supplements manufacturer . Taking to the stand for the first time, Mr McDonnell told the court in Richmond, Virginia: 'She seemed to be upset, concerned about her role. 'I could tell she was not as happy as I was about the result.' The former governor said that the morning after his victory, his wife began yelling at him because he was focused on making and receiving calls. The court also heard that Mr McDonnell had to 'calm his wife down' after an argument moments before President Obama called to congratulate him on his victory. Other witnesses, including several former aides to Mrs McDonnell, have testified that she was miserable as first lady. She hated public speaking and the loss of privacy, and she was prone to angry outbursts. James Burke, a management consultant brought in because of what he called 'the undue amount of chaos' in the governor's mansion stemming from Maureen McDonnell's unhappiness and rage, said the possibility of her moving back into the couple's home in suburban Richmond was briefly discussed but nothing came of it. Mr McDonnell added that he had reassured his wife that she would do a good job. Mr McDonnell, whose term ended in January, says there was nothing unusual about organizing a meeting between a top health official and Jonnie Williams - the CEO of Star Scientific supplements . Bob and Maureen McDonnell are on trial on charges that they took the gifts and loans from Jonnie Williams, the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific Inc., in exchange for promoting his company's products. Mr McDonnell admitted yesterday that they did host a launch event for one of Mr Williams' products and organized a meeting between him and a top health official, but said this was not unusual - the Times Dispatch reported. Mr McDonnell said the maker of tobacco-based anti-inflammatory Anatabloc only received basic help - no state funds or appointments. 'I — my administration — did very little but provide routine access to government,' he told the court. Mr Williams, who testified for the prosecution under the condition of immunity, said he showered the McDonnells with gifts and loans to entice them to help him gain acceptance and state-backed research for his company. Mr McDonnell said he did little more than provide 'routine access to government' when he hosted a launch meeting for one of Mr Williams' products . Among the favors prosecutors said the McDonnells provided were hosting a product launch event at the mansion and arranging a meeting with a top health official. Mr McDonnell said there was nothing unusual about either, citing countless meetings he had arranged and at least two mansion events that were held for specific companies. The former governor said   more than 300 events with 25,000 guests were hosted at his mansion during his four-year term, which ended in January. He added that it was routine to add names to guest lists for events at the mansion or to attend an event where attendees gave checks to the administration, though he claimed to be aware that most people who handed over money hoped for 'something' in return. He said: 'My rule of thumb is every contributor wants something. ... For many it's good government, clean government.' The trial continues.

"By . Belinda Robinson . The U.S. Navy has carried out ground breaking tests of its unmanned drone X-47B alongside a manned F/A-18 fighter jet. The tests were conducted on the carrier deck of the Theodore Roosevelt in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 17. It was the first time that the two aircraft have operated from the same carrier. Capt. Beau Duarte said: ‘Today we showed that the X-47B could take off, land and fly in the carrier pattern with manned aircraft while maintaining normal flight deck operations.’ Tests: A X47-B Navy drone, similar to this one, underwent tests alongside a manned F/A-18 fighter jet . Aircraft carrier: The tests took place aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Atlantic Ocean . Jets: Two F/A 18 jet fighters fly over the US Navy cruiser USS Gettysburg the U.S. Navy carried out ground breaking joint tests of its unmanned drone X-47B along with a manned F/A-18 . 'This is key for the future carrier air wing,’ he added. Capt. Duarte - the program manager for the Navy's unmanned carrier aviation office - along with Navy officials said that the test flights were a milestone in carrier-based naval aviation. On Sunday morning, the drone flew in the landing pattern with the F/A-18 at speeds of 120 mph, at a pattern altitude of 1,200 feet, according to manufacturer Northrop Grumman Corp. After a short flight, the X-47B came in for an arrested landing where a deck-based operator used a deck handling control to manually move it out of the way and taxied it out of the landing area. The F/A-18 then touched down, close behind the drone. ‘This cooperative launch and recovery sequence will be repeated multiple times over the course of the planned test periods,’ a Navy spokesman told The Los Angeles Times. ‘The X-47B performed multiple arrested landings, catapults, flight deck taxiing and deck refuelling operations.’ Combat drones are mostly used by the Air Force and CIA. Landing: After a short flight, the X-47B, similar to this one pictured, came in for an arrested landing where a deck-based operator used a deck handling control to manually move it . The drones have a range of more than 2,400 miles and can be navigated by a human pilot even if they are located thousands of miles away – making it a military asset. It also means that missions carried out by drones can be conducted by a computer to chart its course. Navy fighter pilots fly missions for over 10 hours, but drones can fly for three times that long. The X-47B is jet-powered and has a weapons bay with a payload capacity of 4,500 pounds. The drone has a 62-foot wingspan and can fly higher than 40,000 feet. Its nickname is ‘Salty Dog 502.’ Built by Northrop Grumman Corp., it looks like a mini-B-2 stealth bomber. But the X-47B was designed as an experimental jet and stands at the cutting edge of technology showing how an automated system can work. The Navy has confirmed that it will carry out similar tests to the one done on Sunday, in the near future. However while the exact cost of the test is unknown, there are estimates that the entire programme  costs as much as $6billion.","The tests were carried out on the carrier deck of the Theodore Roosevelt .

"By . Larisa Brown . The £99 pastel-coloured coat from Zara is flying off the shelves . With Spring already on our doorsteps, it is hardly a surprise our wardrobes are becoming brighter. And this season it seems yellow is the colour of the high-street’s sell-out coat. Zara has seen its £99.99 pale yellow collarless cover-up flying off the shelves after fashionistas gave it the nod. Demand for the zip-front, double-pocket item rocketed in the past month as temperatures soared well-above the average for the March. Already celebrities and fashion gurus have ditched their drab, wintery wardrobe staples and opted for brighter, ‘feel-good’ clothes. According to the Spanish high-street chain, the minimal, sixties-inspired style has been keeping shop assistants on their toes as they are repeatedly having to replenish stocks of the coat. A sales assistant at the Oxford Street branch in London said: ‘We can’t sell enough of them. ‘We’re selling more than 30 of them a day in this store.’ Fashion magazine editors endorsed the statement coat – which ticks of one of the season’s trends of pale colours. They have teamed the coat with jeans or skinny trousers. Georgia Simmonds, features assistant at Elle magazine, said: ‘The bright colour and 1960s shape shout summer, even if weather disagrees.’ Jessica Hogan, Vogue’s beauty and health editor, said that ‘it’s the sartorial equivalent of adding a slick of red lip stick – it gives you the same lift.’ And it is not just Zara that is seeing yellow and pastel coloured clothes flying off the shelves. Figures have risen by 25 per cent at Fenwick, where By Malene Birger yellow jackets and skirts have almost sold out. Sharon Stone was pictured here in West Hollywood wearing Spring's hottest colour . Also proving popular are pale pink items by DKNY and Paule Ka. Natalie Kingham, head of the Matches Fashion website, said: ‘There’s been an uplift in sales on light, summery shades.’ Actress Karen Gillan wore a floor length pale pink dress, covered in sequins, as she arrived to a shoot for new TV show Selfie at the weekend. Amy Childs from The Only Way is Essex stepped out in a yellow coat earlier this month, in addition to skinny jeans and beige stilettos. Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan also wore a pale large-collared grey coat on a night out in Manchester last week. At Harrods, a pale leather Balenciaga biker jacket has been selling faster than the black version and pale-shade coats and tops by Chloe, Nina Ricci and Christopher Kane are doing remarkably well.In many instances they are having to be re-ordered, according to Helen David, fashion director at the store.","The £99.99 yellow coat from Zara has been flying off the shelves .

'When Kate was photographed in Blue Almonds whilst pregnant, interest in Moses baskets definitely increased and sales of similar infant beds have also boomed. More recently I’ve had a number of parents bringing in clippings of pictures of George and asking for similar styles - they even ask if I can order the exact pieces in.

"By . Deni Kirkova . It was the biggest hair trend of last summer, and it seems pink hair is back on fashion's radar - but not as you might remember it. The rosy hue was huge on catwalks and editorials again for SS14 but instead of washed out or dip dye, colour was seen only through the mid-lengths - leaving roots and tips untouched. New York-based colorist Aura Friedman pioneered the 'halo' trend in August on Chairlift singer Caroline Polachek by bleaching a stripe across her brunette hair. Now, supermodel Poppy Delevingne, who is marrying her man James Cook today, is the latest star to sport a splashlight - but this time it's a girly shade of pink, and totally noncommittal. She's not likely to be wearing it for her big nuptials. L'Oréal Professionnel SS14 IT LOOKS campaign includes international IT girl Poppy Delevingne in a key colour trends for this season - the splash of pink . She is engaged to be married and loved-up Poppy, 28, is now willing to try new things with her hair look for the first time ever. Poppy . says: 'For me, it’s the perfect evolution of the dip dye, which . was the big colour story of recent years. 'This is the first time I've changed the . colour of my hair. I've been blonde all my life and felt this was the . moment to try something different. 'Since I was a little girl I always wanted to one day have pink hair, especially after the cartoon character Jem and the holograms where the lead character had long, candy floss coloured hair.' The Splashlight, credited as one of L'Oréal Professionnel's latest IT Looks for SS14, involves adding a horizontal . band of striking colour - a splash of pink for example - through the mid length section. New York-based colorist Aura Friedman pioneered the 'halo' trend in August on Chairlift singer Caroline Polachek by bleaching a stripe across her brunette hair . Poppy's look was created especially for the brand using their new Hairchalks. It's inspired by the huge influx of pink on the catwalk in both clothes and make-up at Lanvin, Victoria Beckham, Giorgio Armani, Balmain and Prabel Gurung. The daring new colour trend is now slowly filtering through to . celebrities and fashionistas, soon to be seen on High Streets . everywhere as girls flock to hairdressers requesting this style. Tell us about the splashlight you created for Poppy: . It’s . a new and original way of adding a flash of colour to long hair, a . horizontal band of striking colour that runs through the mid-lengths . section. This placement is what makes the look so eye catching, because . it is unexpected and you intrigued as to how the splashlight was . created. Why was Poppy chosen to model the pink splashlight IT Look: . Because, like Poppy, the splashlight is fun and fresh. The pastel pink also works particularly well on natural blonde base. Can I try a splashlight if I'm brunette? I . might choose a colour that was a little deeper and darker. Perhaps a . violet or purple shade to compliment the natural brown base. Is skin tone important to consider when choosing a splashlight colour? The . most important thing is to start with a base of natural hair colour at . the roots and ends because it will tie in with the skin tone. You can . then be more experimental with your choice of splashlight shade. L’Oreal . Professionel Hairchalk is great since it provides a range of bold . colour options but the commitment is low since it washes out after a few . shampoos. The most important thing is to start with a base of natural hair colour at the roots and ends . A L'Oreal spokesperson said: 'With . pink so visible on the catwalk, the trend seemed to escalate as the . year went on and Splashlight was a new placement area in the hair . (middle band on Poppy). 'It gives a big impact without as much commitment . as an all over colour wash to the vibrant shade alongside the launch of . our Hairchalks. 'The trend means you could go pink for the weekend and be back to . normal on Monday for work.' Poppy recently returned from the Coachella festival, where she celebrated her upcoming nuptials with a series of mini hen dos. Poppy is due to marry fiance James Cook tomorrow. The pair are pictured here at a premiere together . Tools: . For this effect put the L'Oréal Professionnel pink hairchalk into a . disposable plastic bowl and use a clean make-up sponge to apply. LOreal's Hairchalk comes in a variety of colours for different hair shades .

"By . Ruth Styles . Growing up with a parent who suffers from depression is never easy but for Becky, 14, from Hull, things became considerably worse when her mother lost her job as well. So strapped for cash did the family become, Becky and her younger sister Rosie, eight, found themselves with less than £1.50 a day to spend on food. But despite the difficulties, Becky, who is determined to find a way to make a better life for herself and her sister, has taken the first step on the road to becoming an artist. Hard times: Becky, 14, and Rosie, eight, live with their unemployed mother and have £1.20 a day for food . Talented: Becky dreams of becoming a Manga artist and making a better life for herself . The budding cartoonist spent a week with Japanese artist Chie Kutsuwada learning how to create Manga comic strips, following a stint spent filming new Channel 4 documentary, Children on the Breadline. 'It’s been . difficult,' explains the 14-year-old of her straitened upbringing. 'I mean sometimes, mum has sold her own necklaces and family . items. 'She can’t get those things back. It’s like selling memories, . it’s just not right.' Worse still, says the teen, was becoming one of the estimated 300,000 children per year who are forced to rely on food banks to eat. 'I . was really on edge with the idea,' she reveals. 'I didn’t want to be fixed with the . label ”poor person”, as a couple more stereotypes are thrown in with . that — like poor personal hygene, and that’s something I take pride in. 'Using the food bank felt a little bit embarrassing, but when my mother came home with a huge gigantic . smile on her face, it felt a little less daunting. 'After going to the . food bank we’ve made a couple of new friends and I’m very grateful for . what we have.' Food banks and food aid charities gave . more than 20 million meals last year to people in the UK who could not . afford to feed themselves – a 54 per cent increase on the previous 12 . months, according to a report by Oxfam, Church Action on . Poverty and The Trussell Trust. 'The . troubling reality is that there are also thousands more people . struggling with food poverty who have no access to food aid, or are too . ashamed to seek help, as well as a large number of people who are only . just coping by eating less and buying cheap food,' comments Chris Mould, chairman of The Trussell Trust. Cartoon: This cartoon, part of a series by Becky, describes her reaction to visiting a food bank . Depression: This shows Becky and Rosie peeking nervously at their mother who stands in a cloud of gloom . 'Trussell . Trust food banks are seeing parents skipping meals to feed their . children and significant repercussions of food poverty on physical and . mental health.' Becky, however, is one of the lucky ones and is determined not to make the same mistakes as her parents. 'I . want to break the cycle, I want to make sure I have a decent future for . myself and my own family,' she reveals. 'I wanted to be a manga understudy either for . some manga company. Just be an understudy. Help illustrate stuff. 'I’ve . been drawing for as long as I can remember. It can be a release. I mean . you can draw your emotions on a sheet of paper, sometimes you can’t . write them down, you can’t speak them but you can definitely draw them . on paper.' And while studying Manga in Hull has proved difficult, her time spent studying with Manga cartoonist Kutswada has already given her a boost. 'My mum seems brighter than usual . and I hope she keeps it up,' she says rather poignantly. 'I love this new feeling, and I remain just . as optimistic as ever!' Becky appears on Children on the Breadline, tonight at 7.30pm on Channel 4 .","Becky, 14, from Hull lives with her depressed mother and sister Rosie, 8 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A bride who feared her big day would be ruined by building work outside her family home was gobsmacked when workmen provided a guard of honour using diggers and painted a message of congratulations on the road. Hannah Kirk, 34, thought her special day would be spoiled by tram works taking place outside her parent's house in Beeston, Nottingham. She was heartbroken that the tradition of travelling to the ceremony from her childhood home would not be fulfilled as the road had been closed for the last two weeks. Guard of honour: Hannah Kirk and her father Ken pictured alongside the wedding car and arch for them to pass under created by a carefully positioned JCB . Serenade: The bridal party were greeted by machine operator Eddie O'Donnell playing the flute . Parents Ken, 65, and June, 74, had begged contractors Taylor Woodrow Alstom to suspend work so a car could reach their home on Saturday. But the workmen dug deep to go one better and surprised Hannah on the morning of her special day with a send-off she would never forget. She left the house to wed fiance James Jackson, 23, to find a red carpet flanked with flower pots and a JCB archway above her wedding car. They had also permanently painted wedding bells and written 'congratulations' in road markings outside her front door. Day they won't forget: The workmen drew wedding bells and the word 'congratulations' on the road outside Hannah's parent's house in permanent paint . Red carpet treatment: The workmen set up a floral pathway to lead Hannah to her awaiting car . Memorable send-off: Hannah had feared getting ready for her wedding at her childhood home would not be possible thanks to the tram works but they ended up enhancing her day . Tram worker Eddie O'Donnell was also on hand wearing his high-vis clothing to serenade the wedding party with a tune on a traditional Irish flute. Yesterday delighted Hannah said: 'I had absolutely no idea, it was just amazing. I was overwhelmed and overjoyed. 'It is wonderful the effort everyone has gone to, I felt like a princess, it was a great start to a great day. I've always wanted to go from my parents' house and I was worried I couldn't do. I'm so pleased, I'm so happy - I can't believe it.' Hannah and James first met five and a half years ago and had been planning their wedding at Colwick Hall, a Grade II listed manor house in Nottingham, for nearly a year. Father-of-the-bride Ken added: 'We're glad we made it happen. She looked absolutely beautiful, I am so proud of her. Delighted: Hannah couldn't believe the effort the workmen had gone to for her big day . Here comes the bride: Hannah was able to travel to her wedding venue from her parent's house thanks to the Taylor Woodrow Alstom workers . 'I had an inkling they were spraying something onto the street but I had no idea about the flute player or the diggers, it was certainly something different.' Tram worker Eddie said: 'The song I played is called One to One and it was written by my friend for his own wedding day, so it is a very special song.' Machine operator Duncan Collison, 36, added: 'I came down an helped set the diggers up this morning. 'I've never seen anything like it before. It's going to be a bit surreal going back to the day job now.' Mark Freeman, foreman from Taylor Woodrow Alstom, said: 'It was her day and we tried to alleviate any impact the work had on it. 'We did a bit of reinstatement work and put a message out there for her.'","Hannah Kirk, thought her special day .

"By . Ruth Styles . From dealing with the menopause to battling empty nest syndrome, life isn't always easy for women beginning their sixth decade. Looking good: Life coach Rebecca Perkins has written a guide to handing mid life in style . But that could all be about to change thanks to an unusual new self-help tome penned by over-50's blogger and life coach, Rebecca Perkins. In Best Knickers Always: 50 Lessons For Midlife, Perkins reveals how women in their 50s can be happier, healthier and sexier than ever before - even if divorce has left them to navigate the murky waters of later-life dating. 'I’ve spoken to a number of women about later life dating and their experiences vary incredibly,' explains Perkins. 'Many are terrified of having . sex again, they are worried about their body shape and they fear this . level of intimacy. 'For others it’s the not knowing what to say or how to . be on a date, it’s been such a long time since they dated. 'They are . worried about online dating as they focus only on the horror stories . they’ve heard from others. They worry about being hurt as they may well . still feel bruised from the ending of their previous relationship.' That, however, doesn't mean their worst fears are founded and Perkins, who is divorced herself, has a wealth of tips to share. 'I’d say firstly know why you are dating: Are you looking for a long term partner, companionship or perhaps some no strings fun? 'That . way you’ll know what type of person you’re looking to date. Don’t go on a . date with a person who says they want no strings when you are looking . for a long term relationship. It will end in tears. 'Secondly, . make this fun, relax and enjoy it. You might make some really good new . friends. Thirdly, have a positive attitude and be open-minded. You . never know who you might meet.' Still gorgeous: Sharon Stone and Michelle Pfeiffer, both 56, still look as amazing as they ever did . 1. Learn to love yourself, truly accepting who you are. 2. Do what you love. Rediscover your passion and pursue it. 3. Nourish your body - feed it well and exercise. 4. Meditate or find time for solitude . 5. Make gratitude for all that is good in your life a daily habit. But it's not just the challenges of dating later in life that confront today's over-50's. There's the question of maintaining your looks, reappraising long term relationships and most importantly of all, carving out a new role in the family once adult children have left home. The solution, says Perkins, is to approach things positively and see them as an exciting challenge rather than the end of life as you know it. 'Midlife can be a very exciting time if you choose to look at it in a different way,' she explains. 'You need to ask: ""How do I . want to live the second half of my life?"", ""What have I been putting off . doing that now I can get started on?"", ""What dreams have I put on hold . because of my responsibilities to everyone else?"" 'Yes, this takes courage . but it’s also important to ask these questions because you really . don't want to get to the end of your life filled with regret.' Next comes learning to appreciate yourself for who you are - grey hair, wrinkles and bulkier bodies included. 'We look in the mirror and expect to see . the girl we once were,' explains Perkins. 'The media is full of youth, vibrancy, . skinny bodies and shiny white teeth and if you compare yourself with that, then it's no wonder you have low self-esteem. 'The women you should look up to in . midlife are those with an inner beauty. Their self esteem and . wisdom comes because of the life they have lived. 'I have lines on my . face, I have a shock of silver hair, my body bears witness to the three . children I carried and bore. 'Do I wish I was 21 again? No! I have accepted who I am and my self esteem does not depend . on what my body looks like.' Yummy mummies: Andie MacDowell, 56, and Julianne Moore, 53, both remain incredibly beautiful . Top tips: Rebecca's book: Best Knickers Always: 50 Lessons For Midlife is out now . And there's certainly no shortage of glamorous over-50s women seemingly bent on proving that good looks aren't just for 20 and 30-somethings. Sharon Stone, 56, becomes more of a bombshell with each passing year, while Michelle Pfeiffer, 56, Julianne Moore, 53, and Andie MacDowell, 56, all look better than ever. Nevertheless, for many over-50s, dealing with midlife is something they need to be supported through and for this, nothing beats enlisting the help of grown-up children. 'My children have been amazing,' says Perkins. 'They have . loved and supported and encouraged me on this journey. 'I think showing your . vulnerability to your children is vital. I think you become more . approachable when you say: ""I can’t do this alone"" or ""I need some help"". 'The children of the midlife woman can really help just by being there . for her, listening and understanding what she’s going through, even if it’s tough for them too. Change is never easy.' Nevertheless, Perkins, who says that the main thing holding over-50s women back is fear, says that with a little belief and courage you can become the person you always wanted to be. 'If I could offer just once piece of advice to those women hitting their 50s, it would be: ""You . have more courage than you believe"",' she says. 'Courage is sometimes simply finding the strength to face . another day. Courage is learning to let go and to start again. Courage is . having faith in yourself. Smiling, she adds: 'It’s one of  my favourite lessons in the book.'

"By . Mark Prigg . Children's diseases tend to spread across America from one coast to another, researchers say. They plotted the progress of a range of conditions including Diptheria, Scarlet Fever and Polio. They say the weather is key to the spread. Scarlet fever peaked in Rhode Island a month later than in Alabama, Bakker found -and epidemics peaked in Dec-Jan in the SE USA and Feb-Mar in the rest of the country. The colours represent the number of cases - with dark blue being worst hit, and white having no cases. Scarlet Fever epidemics peaked in Dec-Jan in the SE USA and Feb-Mar in the rest of the country. Diphtheria epidemics peaked in Nov-Dec in the SE USA, and Jan-Feb in the rest of the country. With Typhoid Fever, a summer epidemic, the pattern was latitudinal with epidemics in the Southern US (August) occurring about a month prior to more Northern states (September). This same pattern in epidemic timing was seen in Polio, with August peaks in the South, and late September peaks in the North. 'I was interested in examining whether the timing of these childhood infections peaked at different times of the year across a spatial scale,' Kevin Bakker, who led the study at the University of Michigan, told MailOnline. He found that in the United States, the wintertime epidemics hit first in the Southeast, and then spread northward during the 1920s to the 1950s. For example, scarlet fever peaked in Rhode Island a month later than in Alabama, Bakker found. Diphtheria followed the same pattern, but the disease spiked about a month before scarlet fever. 'Interestingly, in the case of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever, epidemics peaked in the American Southeast a few months prior to the rest of the country,' Bakker said. The study relies on more than a century of newly digitized infectious-disease records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide a comprehensive view of disease patterns . Researchers hope the maps could help spot the diseases spreading in future outbreaks. He hopes the maps could help spot the diseases spreading in future outbreaks. 'Overall, I am interested in the mechanisms driving these patterns, and why we see these geographic patterns in these 4 diseases. 'This is important because many of these diseases are still endemic in parts of the world, and understanding why the epidemics are peaking across space could help us reduce this disease burden.' Scarlet Fever epidemics peaked in Dec-Jan in the SE USA and Feb-Mar in the rest of the country, Bakkar said, while Diphtheria epidemics peaked in Nov-Dec in the SE USA, and Jan-Feb in the rest of the country. With Typhoid Fever, a summer epidemic, the pattern was latitudinal with epidemics in the Southern US (August) occurring about a month prior to more Northern states (September).

"By . Associated Press . Former Mayor Buddy Cianci's face beams from the label of his Mayor's Own Marinara Sauce, which also promises that sales are 'Benefiting Providence School Children' and have helped hundreds of students attend college. But in recent years, no money from the sauce's sales has been donated to Cianci's charity scholarship fund, The Associated Press has learned. From 2009 to 2012, the sauce made a total of $3 in income, longtime Cianci adviser Charles Mansolillo told the AP. Mansolillo — Cianci's former city solicitor and the vice president, secretary and treasurer of the company that sells the pasta sauce — acknowledged the label could be misunderstood and said he would like to see it changed. Murky: Bottles of former Providence Mayor Buddy Cianci's pasta sauce sits on the shelf at a grocery store in Providence, Rhode Island. The sauce claims to be 'Benefiting Providence School Children' 'People are thinking that every time they are buying a bottle of pasta (sauce) they're making a contribution. That is not necessarily the case. That's got to be clearly stated,' Mansolillo said. 'It benefits the scholarship fund when it's possible. ... I don't think even in the best year any more than two or three scholarships could be said to come from that.' Cianci was mayor for a combined 21 years over two separate stints starting in 1975. Both ended in felony convictions. He started selling the sauce in 1995, during his second go-round as mayor and before he was sent to prison in 2002 for presiding over widespread corruption in City Hall. He is now running again for his old job as an independent. The ex-mayor said he puts money into the sauce every year and has never personally made money on it. He said expenses such as labels, taxes and insurance eat away profits many years. Even if the sauce loses money some years, it's great publicity for the scholarship, and, admittedly, for himself, he acknowledged. 'There's a certain public relations aspect to it all to me, I can't deny that,' Cianci told the AP. In 1994, Cianci set up a fund that awards scholarships to college-bound high school seniors from Providence. This year, 13 students received the $1,000 scholarship. A press release dated June 8 states, ""The scholarships are funded from a portion of the sales from The Mayor's Own Marinara sauce.' Mansolillo is also president of the scholarship fund, and he told the AP that they always intended to use the income to supplement the scholarship fund. The fund currently has about $500,000 in assets, he said. In 2009, they lost $2,200 on the sauce, Mansolillo said. The following year, they made $2,974, while in 2011, they lost $2,969. In 2012, they made $2,198 profit, he said. That adds up to a profit of just $3 during the 4-year period. Much of the money currently in the fund came from previous fundraising efforts, such as golf tournaments, as well as sales of the pasta sauce, Cianci and Mansolillo said. The fund now makes most of its income from investments and has received only $450 in contributions since 2005, according to forms filed with the IRS. In that sense, Mansolillo said, past sauce sales are benefiting Providence school children today. But he also acknowledged that the meaning of the line ""Benefiting Providence School Children"" might not be entirely clear to consumers. Not backing down: Cianci, who ran Providence for 22 of the past 50 years and is now running for a third stint as mayor, is convinced that his hometown needs him again and isn't going to let a little thing like the five years he spent in prison after a racketeering conviction stand in his way . 'At the end of the day, I think we should just take it off,' he said. 'It's giving an impression that possibly we're going to the bank on this. That we're banking our scholarship on this when we're not, and we don't have to.' Newman's Own, the food company founded by the late actor Paul Newman, gives all after-tax profits to charity, something it specifically states on its label. Mansolillo said Capital Innovations, the company that sells Cianci's sauce and where Cianci serves as president, was intentionally vague on the label and didn't make specific promises because, 'We didn't want to be held anything.' Cianci and Mansolillo said sales have been hurt in past years by mismanagement from some of the sauce's previous distributors, one of which went bankrupt. During the time when Cianci was in prison from 2002 to 2007, the sauce sometimes was not on the shelves at all. When asked why they continue to make the sauce when it has not benefited the charity in years, Mansolillo said they are hopeful that things are going to do better and that it benefits the economy by providing jobs to the people who make it and distribute it. A many of many sides: Cianci's scholarship fund is more generous than his sauce, giving out $12,000 in scholarships in 2011 . 'It's a good product, and a lot of people like it,' Cianci said. Bob Borges, gourmet manager at Eastside Market in Providence, said the sauce sells well at his store, which goes through about a dozen 12-jar cases a month. He said he thinks first-time purchasers might buy it because they think sales are benefiting children, but they wouldn't get the repeat sales they get unless it was good.

"By . Associated Press . and Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Former dictator Hosni Mubarak appeared red-eyed and frail but nonetheless defiant as he appeared locked inside a caged dock in an Egyptian courtroom today. The 86-year-old, dressed in a blue prison uniform and sitting on a hospital stretcher, denied ordering the killing of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 revolt that dethroned him. Instead, in his first lengthy statement to the court as his retrial draws to an end, he described his 29-year reign as one that stabilised Egypt - a theme he previously drew on in his final days in power. Former Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, left, and his son Alaa sit behind bars during their trial at the Police Academy in Cairo, where he defended his actions in the final days of the revolt that toppled him from power . Frail Mubarak, 86, raises his hand to protect himself from the sun as he leaves a helicopter ambulance after it landed at Maadi Military Hospital, following his court appearance where he denied ordering protesters killed . 'Hosni Mubarak speaking to you today would never order the killing of protesters or shedding the blood of Egyptians,' Mubarak said. 'I voluntarily chose to give up my responsibility as president to prevent bloodshed and to preserve national unity, for Egypt not to slip into a dangerous path toward the unknown,' he said. Mubarak was found guilty in June 2012 of failing to stop the killing of over 900 protesters during the 18-day uprising and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his conviction was overturned in January 2013. That decision was appealed by prosecutors, and a retrial began in April 2013. Standing trial alongside Mubarak was his security chief, Habib el-Adly, convicted and sentenced to life in prison on the same charges, as well as six of el-Adly's top aides. All six were acquitted in the earlier trial. The final verdict will be issued on September 27, the judge said. Egyptian medics and army personnel escort Mubarak: The former autocrat said he 'voluntarily chose' to give up power 'to prevent bloodshed and preserve national unity' and save Egypt from 'a dangerous path' Retrial: Mubarak was found guilty in June 2012 of failing to stop the killing of over 900 protesters during the 18-day uprising and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his conviction was overturned in January 2013 . In the first days of the 'Arab Spring' uprising that overthrew Egypt's U.S.-backed military regime, protesters stormed police stations across the country after officers responded to demonstrations with deadly force. Nearly 200 policemen and security officials were subsequently put on trial, but all were acquitted either for lack of evidence or under the pretext that the police acted in self-defence. The acquittals became a cornerstone of Mubarak's defence strategy. Mubarak said that the 2011 protests began peacefully but were taken over by 'exploiters of religion inside and outside the country' who steered the demonstrations toward violence. It was the same language often used by Mubarak-era media men and officials to refer to the Muslim Brotherhood, whose leader Mohammed Morsi became Mubarak's successor in the country's only ever free elections in 2012.

(AP Photo/Amr Nabil) A year later, the military overthrew Morsi after millions staged demonstrations against him demanding his resignation for what they called abuse of power. The government branded the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group and unleashed a deadly crackdown against its supporters, who staged near daily rallies demanding Morsi's return to power. Hundreds were killed and thousands jailed on violence-linked charges. Morsi himself faces charges that carry the death sentence. The Brotherhood is preparing for mass demonstrations on Thursday to commemorate the anniversary of the violent dispersal of pro-Morsi sit-ins. Human Rights Watch accused authorities of using lethal force and said the killings amount to crimes against humanity, which the government angrily rejected.","Former dictator made his first lengthy court statement of his retrial .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . London Mayor Boris Johnson is facing calls to ban ‘poor doors’ in upmarket blocks of flats, which force people on low incomes to use different entrances. Developers in London are promising wealthy tenants they will not have to share their smart lobby entrances, courtyard gardens or secure parking with people living in flats classed as ‘affordable housing’. The practice faces being banned in New York after a backlash and has sparked a political row in the UK with Labour condemning the covert ‘segregation’. Scroll down for video . A bespoke entrance lobby ... with the ambience of a stylish hotel reception area at One Commercial Street is only available to some of the better-off residents . The problem stems from rules which are supposed to stop areas becoming ghettos for the very rich. When planning permission is granted, developers are often told to set aside a set number of units for affordable housing. From the outside, there is often no way of telling the more basic homes from the hi-spec apartments aimed at the super-rich. But behind the façade, less well-off tenants are forced to enter through different doors and use separate bicycle racks, bins and post boxes. Labour’s shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds told MailOnline: ‘I am strongly against this kind of segregation. There shouldn’t be separate doors for people living in affordable housing. ‘Many of the developers that I have been to haven’t had this distinction but I am deeply concerned that it is something happening in the UK.’ How Queen's Park Place explains to would-be tenants that affordable housing residents will use a 'separate entrance' A furious row erupted in New York earlier this month when the city council approved a proposal by one of the largest real estate developers in the city to build in a 'poor door'. It would force affordable housing tenants at a high-rise next to the Hudson River to walk through an entrance located in a back alley behind the building to enter, leaving the more prominent front entrance for tenants paying for nicer apartments. New York Mayor Bill De Blasio moved to say it should be allowed, blaming the previous administration of Michael Bloomberg. A spokesman said: ‘We fundamentally disagree with that approach, and we are in the process of changing it to reflect our values and priorities. ‘We want to make sure future affordable housing projects treat all families equitably.’ But according to a report in the Guardian, many developments in London are promising wealthy prospective tenants the same segregation. It found a ‘bespoke entrance lobby ... with the ambience of a stylish hotel reception area’ at One Commercial Street. But some residents are not able to use the main entrance with a 24/7 concierge and must instead use a side door near a trade entrance for Pret a Manger. One development at Queen’s Park Place, north-west London, states ‘affordable homes will have a separate entrance’. ‘Affordable tenants will not have use of the main private residential entrance, private courtyard gardens or basement car and cycle parking. Services, including postal delivery and refuse storage are also divided.’ A view of the high-rises lining Riverside Boulevard, in New York. The city approved an application by prominent developer Extell to install a 'poor door', or a separate door for tenants living in affordable housing to enter the building through . Judy Brown, had also expected to be able to get to her flat through the main entrance. 'I call it the posh door. I feel a little bit insulted. It's segregation.' David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said the revelations were ‘disturbing’ and asked: ‘Will Boris follow De Blasio and ban them?’ Green party London assembly member Darren Johnson said: 'This trend shows contempt for ordinary people, and is about developers selling luxury flats to rich investors who don't want to mix with local people.'","Developments promise rich tenants they will not share with other residents .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . Police have issued a new drug warning after a deadly batch of pills were seized and believed to have caused a number of deaths in Australia and overseas. The light blue tablets are stamped with a Batman logo and sold as a form of ecstasy to drug users. The pills were believed to be responsible for a number of bad reactions at a music festival in the Hawkesbury area of Sydney last weekend. In a statement issued on Friday, police said the tablets contained dangerous levels of 25c-NBOMe, which is an extremely effective psychoactive substance. Police have issued a new drug warning after a deadly batch of pills were seized and believed to have caused a number of deaths in Australia and overseas . The Commander of the Drug Squad, Detective Superintendent Tony Cooke said there had been cases in Australia and overseas where people affected by the NBOMe class of drug had died. 'We are aware of the Blue Batman pills and, in particular, a number of bad reactions users had after taking them at an event in the Hawkesbury last weekend,' Detective Superintendent Cook said. 'In fact, similar pills recently seized by police contained the drug 25c-NBOMe, one of the so called new psychoactive substances recently outlawed. A closely related substance was in fact involved in the death of a young man in Sydney last year.' Detective Superintendent Cooke reminded people that they are putting their lives at risk every time they consume illicit drugs. 'Illicit drugs have been outlawed for a reason – they are very dangerous,' Detective Superintendent Cooke said. 'The reality is there is no quality control in the production of illicit drugs. You just do not know what you are taking. 'Illicit drugs are produced in filthy backyard laboratories by criminals with absolutely no interest other than making money. They will do whatever it takes to ensure a fatter profit margin can be achieved. 'That includes producing drugs and misrepresenting their true nature, cutting drugs with caffeine, washing powder, whatever, in a bid to get a better return on their sale. 'The health and wellbeing of their customer-base is simply not a priority. 'Anyone who is considering experimenting with illicit or synthetic drugs should stop to consider the possible consequences and not do it. It’s a gamble with your life that’s just not worth taking.'","The light blue tablets are stamped with a Batman logo and sold as a form of ecstasy to drug users .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . Rural drivers concerned they will be banned from using bull bars on their cars have formed a lobby group to raise awareness of how vital they are in the bush. The Bull Bar Council of Australia has opened up a Facebook page plastered with cars destroyed by accidents they say would have been avoided if the car was equipped with a bull bar, including a 'famous' picture of a dead kangaroo on the back seat of a car after flying through a windscreen. Police have recently launched a crackdown across New South Wales on bull bars, issuing defect notices to drivers, particularly ones with five-post bull bars, which have been illegal since 2003. The concerns from bull bar owners have gone underway after a man was believed to be killed when a kangaroo went crashing through his windscreen in Perth . But Nick Wright, who started the Facebook group in July told Daily Mail Australia that there were no clear reasons as to why police are issuing defect notices or warnings to people. 'We’re not entirely sure why police are cracking down on bull bars – Roads and Maritime and police have not made any comments,' he said. 'They tell the media that they're enforcing rules that have been place in 2003 but there's no actual rules that states in the Australian Design Rule (ADR) that ""five post bars are illegal.' Mr Wright, 25, from Taree NSW said the kangaroo incident from October 2006, saw a 50-year-old man die after a car moving in the opposite direction hit the kangaroo, pushing it through the windscreen of the victim's car near Manjimup, 300km south of Perth. 'The photograph of the dead kangaroo in the backseat pretty much sums up the whole point on why it's so important to have these necessities in rural areas,' he said. Facebook users have taken to the Bull Bar Council of Australia page to form a united front on the issue and raise awareness that lives will be put at risk if they get banned . Another similar incident occurred west of Brisbane in October last year when a six-year-old girl sitting in the back seat of her family car died from a kangaroo smashing through the front windscreen before it exit through the rear window. Mr Wright said that not only do bull bars save lives, they also prevent major impacts to the engines of vehicles involved. 'If someone was driving in the middle of nowhere and was struck by a kangaroo with no bull bar protection - they would be stranded with no food or water, and even phone reception - So we need to make sure bull bars stay legal,' he said. A family car was written off after hitting a kangaroo out of Mount Gambier South Australia. The driver said the damage would have been minimal if he had a bullbar . 'Rural vehicles operate on rural roads and small towns so there's not a lot of people around and they're not distracted by their mobile phones,' Mr Wright said. 'Children are taught to cross roads safely at a young age but I'm still yet to hear someone teaching a kangaroo, feral pig or wombat how to cross the road. 'I am aware that children do the unexpected sometimes and run out on the road to chase a ball but the potential risk of an animal strike on a rural vehicle without a bull bar are greater than the likely hood of hitting a pedestrian. This is not a five post bullbar but it was enough to save the lives of this driver and his dad after they hit a cow at 105kmh . Northern Tablelands MP Adam Marshall raised the issue in NSW Parliament, saying he had been inundated with phone calls, emails and letters from people who had been issued with defect notices or warnings from police for having bull bars on their vehicles which don’t comply with Australian Standards. 'People are trying to do the right thing - they are trying to protect their vehicles and their loved ones yet they are being penalised,' Mr Marshall said. 'Many drivers in my electorate have been caught and have been issued with defect notices by highway police patrol for bullbars that have been factory-fitted or fitted by accredited smash repairers and they have unwittingly been driving around - some of them for many years - with bullbars that do not comply with Australian standards.' This driver of this vehicle said if only he had his five poster bull bar - this wouldn't have happened . 'They are incurring expenses of sometimes in excess of $4000 to replace those bull bars which are compliant with the rules,' Mr Marshall said. 'Bullbars are essential for many people living in rural areas, protecting vehicles and, more importantly, protecting people's lives, especially on our roads with huge numbers of kangaroos and other animals around,' he said. 'It's completely reasonable for people who buy a new vehicle from a dealership fitted with a bullbar or have one fitted by accredited businesses assume that it meets with Australian standards. After all, why would a car dealer or a smash repairer fit a bullbar that is illegal? Why would bullbars that don't comply be allowed to be manufactured and distributed?' This driver said her bull bar saved her life after colliding with an embarkment while falling asleep at the wheel. 'I believe bullbars make a huge difference when it comes to living in the country' Mr Marshall told the Parliament that he had personally taken the issue up with Minister for Roads and Freight Duncan Gay and Minister for Fair Trading Matthew Mason-Cox. 'Both Ministers were very concerned about the situation and I’m grateful for the action that’s been taken already,' he said. 'The NSW Centre for Road Safety is liaising with NSW Police to raise awareness, as I have with local police, that people are being inadvertently caught in this blitz on illegal bull bars. The Centre is also urging that common sense prevail and those who are unwittingly caught should not be unduly penalised. 'Additionally, the Centre, Roads and Maritime Services, police and NSW Fair Trading are now all working together to gather evidence about manufacturers which are producing and selling these non-compliant bull bars. 'In the meantime, I’m going to keep pushing the case for a change of approach over bull bars to ensure people in rural areas are not unduly penalised for staying safe on the road.","Rural drivers fear that the necessity to fend off animals will be outlawed if NSW Police continue to crackdown on bull bars .

"By . Amanda Platell . Oh Kate, what were you thinking? While the rest of the royal party sensibly opted for a muted palette, determined not to outshine the woman at the centre of it all, the Duchess of Cambridge opted for a scarlet dress so bold and bright it just screamed: ‘Look at me!’ For a moment, she could have been confused with the Chelsea Pensioners’ guard of honour. But, no, it was Kate in an outfit as striking as it was inappropriate. Lady in red: The Duchess of Cambridge cut a swathe through the gloomy weather this afternoon as she stepped on to the Spirit of Chartwell wearing a vibrant scarlet Alexander McQueen dress - on her lapel, Kate wore a maritime-themed brooch featuring two silver dolphins.

Throughout her first year as a member of the Royal Family, Kate has . hardly put a fashionably shod foot wrong. Her wedding gown was . tremblingly beautiful and sophisticated. Since then she has cleverly combined High Street with designer clothes: . fashionable but never a fashionista, classic, conservative, sometimes . demure. So why, on the second most important occasion in her public life, did . she opt for an outfit more suited to Ladies’ Day at Aintree alongside . Coleen Rooney than beside Her Majesty at her Diamond Jubilee pageant? An . outfit, indeed, that in its sleeveless version was previously worn by . reality TV star Kim Kardashian and The X Factor judge Tulisa . Contostavlos.

It says something when even Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice were more appropriately attired than the usually immaculate Kate. I blame her family. Not the Royals, but the Middletons. Apparently, the Middleton women, now a bewildering presence at all royal . occasions, had decided to do a ‘red, white and blue’ theme between . sisters and mother, with Carole in white, Pippa in blue and Kate in . crimson. Put together, they no doubt looked like a jolly string of bunting. But, . for heaven’s sake, this wasn’t a promotional shoot for their online . party business, it was a formal royal function.

I realise it must be incredibly difficult to have the eyes of the world . upon her and every outfit scrutinised. But she is clever enough to know . by now what impact her choice of outfit can have on a public occasion; . how every little detail can speak volumes. She also has the best . advisers in the land, not least the Royal Family themselves. Unlike with . Diana, they have done everything to make her feel part of the family . and to help her understand what is required of her. Kate’s advisers have always let it be known that she and William wanted . to be low-key royals.

Let us be charitable and . assume it was never Kate’s intention to steal the limelight from the . Queen, and she was simply badly advised. But there’s a lesson in there for her.  Yes, she looked stunning. But when in the Queen’s company, less is definitely more.

The move comes as a McDonald's outlet in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, and a Burger King in Krasnoyarsk, are the latest to be targeted by the Russian authorities in what is seen as punishment for Western sanctions.

"By . Ruth Styles . They have long been regarded as a nuisance in the garden but it seems that snails could be more friend than foe when it comes to anti-ageing. A revolutionary new facial that involves allowing live snails to slither across the complexion has been hailed the next big thing in beauty thanks to the glow-boosting properties of snail mucus. The mucus, which contains a mix of powerful proteins, antioxidants and hyularonic acid, is said to help skin retain moisture, soothe inflammation and remove dead skin. Scroll down for video . Slimy: Snails are applied to the face after cleansing during Japanese treatment, the Celebrity Escargot Course . Anti-ageing: Snail mucus contains a cocktail of youth-boosting ingredients including hyularonic acid . Effective: The new treatment is also believed to help tackle sun damage . During the 60-minute treatment, which is offered at the Clinical Salon in Tokyo, the face is cleansed before snails are placed on the cheeks and forehead and allowed to move around as they please. The facial, named the Celebrity Escargot Course, costs £161 and also includes a series of facial massages, masks and the use of an electrical pulse machine. 'Snail slime can help the recovery of skin cells on the face, so we expect the snail facial to help heal damaged skin,' Yoko Miniami, sales manager at Tokyo's Clinical Salon which offers the treatment, told the Sunday Telegraph. The substance is also believed to help tackle sun damage, according to Ms Miniami, who said: 'We are interested in the fact that snails have a function that can help heal skin damaged by ultraviolet rays.' According to Ms Miniami, the salon also uses creams infused with snail slime provided by the salon's five resident snails which are fed on organic vegetables, including carrots, spinach, Swiss chard and Japanese komatsuna greens. Disgusting though it might sound, snail slime isn't a recent addition to the anti-ageing arsenal and was first used more than 2000 years ago. According to records left by early doctor Hippocrates, crushed snails mixed with sour milk were used to treat skin inflammation, while more recently, products infused with mollusc slime have proved popular in Japan and South Korea. Despite the long history of snail slime as a beauty treatment, the Clinical Salon's effort was apparently inspired by Mount Fuji's recent elevation to UNESCO World Heritage status. Climbers are likely to suffer skin damage as they climb the peak, thanks to the thinner air and intense sunshine, and it is this the treatment is intended to fix.","Snail mucus is said to contain hyularonic acid, protein and antioxidants .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . and Associated Press . Broadcast legend Kasey Casem died today at age 82 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease and dementia. His children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem announced their father's death on social media. The message does not include the name of . his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly . court battle over his medical treatment. Kasem was known worldwide as the longtime host of radio program 'American Top 40' and as the voice of cartoon character Shaggy from the Scooby-Doo franchise. Scroll down for video . Star: Kasem, seen at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 2003, hosted 'American Top 40' from 1970 - 1988 and again from 1998 - 2003 . Battle: Wife Jean Kasem, left, and daughter Kerri Kasem, right, had fought over Casey Kasem's medical treatment . 'Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,' the message read. 'Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken. 'Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad. With love, Kerri, Mike and Julie.' Kasem died in a Washington hospital at 3.23am, spokesman Danny Deraney said in a statement. In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia. A judge in May temporarily stripped his wife of her caretaker role after she moved him from a medical facility in Los Angeles to a friend's home in Washington state. Jean Kasem said she moved her husband to protect his privacy and to consult with doctors. Casey Kasem developed a severe bedsore while in Washington and was in critical condition by the time he was hospitalized in early June. Kasem's transportation to Washington posed serious risks, according to the New York Daily News. 'She disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration,' Dr. Paul Leitner said in documents obtained by the paper. 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr. Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.' Jean Kasem had objected to a Wednesday ruling in a Los Angeles Superior Court that stopped her husband from being given food and drink over concerns it might be painful for him. 'Right now, Casey Kasem's health is declining and (he) won't be with us much longer,' Danny Deraney said in a June 6 statement. During temporary conservator Kerri Kasem's visit to see her father on June 1 in Washington state, Jean Kasem threw meat at her as he was preparing for a trip to the hospital. 'In the name of King David, I threw a piece of raw meat into the street in exchange for my husband to the wild rabid dogs,' she told NBC News. Star: Kasem, pictured next to wife Jean Kasem, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1981 . Smooth talker: Kasem was known for his gentle, smooth voice on the radio . Casey hosted American Top 40 radio show, and voiced cartoon characters such as Shaggy from Scooby Doo . Kasem's 'American Top 40' began on July 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, when the No. 1 song was Three Dog Night's cover of Randy Newman's ""Mama Told Me Not to Come."" The show expanded to hundreds of stations, including Armed Forces Radio, and continued in varying forms — and for varying syndicators — into the 21st century. He stepped down from 'American Top 40' in 2004 and retired altogether in 2009, completing his musical journey with Shinedown's 'Second Chance.' While many DJs convulsed their listeners with stunts and 'morning zoo' snarkiness, Kasem would read 'long distance dedications' of songs sent in by readers and introduce countdown records with sympathetic background anecdotes about the singers. 'The idea from the beginning was to do the type of thing on radio that Ed Sullivan did on television, good, honest stories with human interest,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 1975. Kasem's legacy reached well beyond music. His voice was heard in TV cartoons such as 'Scooby-Doo' as the voice of Shaggy and in numerous commercials. Casey Kasem is seen with wife Jean Kasem and his children (from left) Kerri Kasem, Michael Kasem and Julie Kasem . Dispute: Mike, Kerri, and Julie Kasem (left - right, with their father Casey second from right in 2003) argue that his wife removed him from a care home towards the end of his life, causing a bedsore which contributed to his death . Legen: In this 2003 file photo, Casey Kasem poses for photographers after receiving the Radio Icon award during the 2003 Radio Music Awards . Time for a Scooby snack! Kasem, who was the voice of Shaggy, is seen next to Scooby-Doo . 'They . are going to be playing Shaggy and Scooby-Doo for eons and eons,' Kasem . told The New York Times in 2004. 'And they're going to forget Casey . Kasem — unless they happen to step on his star on the Hollywood Walk of . Fame. I'll be one of those guys people say 'Who's that?' about. And . someone else will say, 'He's just some guy who used to be on the . radio.'' Succeeding Kasem at the main 'American Top 40' show in 2004 was multiplatform star Ryan Seacrest, who has said he had been a fan of Kasem since boyhood and would imitate him in pretend countdown broadcasts at age 9. Seacrest mourned Kasem's death in a statement on Sunday. 'It’s a sad day for the broadcasting community and for radio listeners around the world,' he said. 'When I was a kid, I would listen to Casey Kasem’s AT40 show every weekend, and dream about someday becoming a radio DJ. So when decades later I took over his AT40 countdown show, it was a surreal moment. Casey had a distinctive friendly on-air voice, and he was just as affable and nice if you had the privilege to be in his company. He’ll be greatly missed by all of us.' Radio and television personality Carson Daly also offered his condolences. 'Long before MTV and the internet #CaseyKasem made sure you were hearing the best music out there,' Daly wrote on Twitter. 'Peace be to his family and RIP. #Respect.' Early days: Kasem is seen in the DJ booth at WJBK station in Detroit in 1957 . Couple: Casey Kasem is seen in this undated photo with wife Jean Kasem . Transpot: Jean Kasem, in this undated photo with Casey Kasem, had her husband moved to Washington state from Santa Monica without telling his family in May . Dangerous: Jean Kasem's transport of husband Casey Kasem to Washington state could have proved fatal, documents show. The couple is pictured in this 1986 photo . The son of Lebanese immigrants, Kasem was active in speaking out for greater understanding of Arab-Americans — both on political issues involving the Mideast and on arts and media issues. 'Arab-Americans are coming out of the closet,' Kasem told The Associated Press in 1990. 'They are more outspoken now than ever before. People are beginning to realize who they really are, that they are not the people who yell and scream on their nightly newscast.' Kasem was born Kemal Amin Kasem in 1932 in Detroit. He began his broadcasting career in the radio club at Detroit's Northwestern High School and was soon a disc jockey on WJBK radio in Detroit, initially calling himself Kemal Kasem. In a 1997 visit with high school students in Dearborn, Michigan, home to a large Arab-American community, he was asked why he changed his name to Casey. 'It didn't sound like a deejay; it wasn't hip. So we decided I'd be 'Casey at the Mike' — and I have been since,' Kasem said. In the 1975 Los Angeles Times interview, he said he had been doing 'a regular screaming DJ show' in San Francisco in the early 1960s when his boss suggested he talk about the records instead. He was unconvinced, since his screaming routine had brought him top ratings. But he said he had learned 'after a particularly unpleasant situation in Buffalo never to argue with general managers.' Prolific: Kasem hosted 'American Top 40' for many years, made appearances in both film and television, and was also known as a voice actor .","Kasem became a broadcast legend as host of American Top 40 countdown and was the voice of beloved characters, including Shaggy from Scooby-Doo .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . Most children have birthday wishlists as long as their arms but all Alejandrina Najera, from Texas, wanted for her 10th birthday was a single card from her parents. But after Alejandrina's request went viral, the little girl, who suffers from an incurable brain disease, has been inundated with cards and presents from all over the world. Alejandrina, who is known to her family as Ali, was born with neuroaxonal dystrophy, a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Scroll down for video . Terminally ill: Alejandrina Najera, nine, has a brain disease that will kill her before she reaches adulthood . Princess: The little girl asked for a card from her parents for her birthday but has since received 850 . In spite of the illness, she led a normal life until the age of eight when doctors revealed that she had neuronal brain with iron accumulation - a terminal, degenerative brain disease. The impact on the little girl was devastating and within a year, she had lost the ability to walk unaided and had begun to show symptoms for autism and anxiety, and suffered muscle spasms. With Alejandrina's 10th birthday less than two weeks away on the 9th September, her mother Tianna Morgan, 29, asked her daughter how she would like to spend it and was asked for a single card. But after Alejandrina's request went viral, she and her family, including brothers Austin, 15, David, six, and Michael, two, and sister Haley, 12, have been deluged with cards and gifts from well-wishers. 'Ali has been so excited to receive the mail, she has a smile on her face every time she sees cards have arrived and she claps for joy,' revealed Ms Morgan. 'As we open and read the cards she keeps a smile on her face.' Alejandrina's request for cards went viral after her story was added to the Letters Project website - an online community of families whose children are struggling with terminal illness and disabilities. The website, which was set up by Samantha Busch, allows well-wishers to send letters directly to families' homes in a bid to cheer them up. So far, Ali has been sent 850 letters and packages from all over the world including Canada, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, France, Australia, Ireland, and Sweden as well as the US. But despite being inundated with boxes of toys, sweets, colouring books, crayons, stickers, bracelets and handmade items, the cards remain Alejandrina's favourite item. Speechless: Mother Tianna says she has been left speechless by the love shown to her little girl by strangers . Close family: Alejandrina with her mother, step-father and siblings outside her home in Texas . 'Ali doesn't love the gifts anymore than she loves the cards,' said Ms Morgan. 'Every single card is very special to her. 'I know after her birthday and all the cards have been read once, Ali will continue to get the cards out just to read them again and again.' Although Alejandrina was diganosed with the condition last October, she remains unaware that the disease has proved fatal for all known sufferers so far. 'We do not know Ali's life expectancy,' says Ms Morgan. 'The disease is so rare and there is no timeline on the progression of it and even if a timeline was known her neurologist told us she has a mutation of the gene never seen before.' Since her diagnosis, Alejandrina has been on sedatives prescribed to ease the symptoms which have left her unable to play with friends or even dress herself. Dream: Alejandrina's parents took her to Disneyworld to meet her favourite princesses, including Snow White . Wonderful: Alejandrina and her family pose for a picture with Tinkerbell during their visit to Disneyworld . Happy: Before developing the disease, Alejandrina was able to walk unaided and live a normal life . Despite her deteriorating condition, Ms Morgan, who set up Princess Ali's Journey with NBIA, a Facebook page on which she posts updates about her daughter's progress, says she copes well with her illness. 'It is very hard to know when Ali is in pain or needing something due to her trouble expressing herself,' she explains. 'It is hard watching your child go through so much and being in pain and knowing there is nothing you can do about it. 'She does not have a full understanding of everything going on because the disease affects her comprehension. 'When we discuss the disease around Ali, she tells us she does not have a disease, because if she had a disease she would be sick - it's heart breaking.' The family have also set up a fundraising page on GoFundMe to help pay for wheelchair friendly modifications to their house and have raised more than £3,000 towards their £30,000 target so far. Apart from her single request for cards, Ms Morgan says that her sick daughter doesn't ask for anything other than good health. 'For my husband and I the cards have meant so much,' added Ms Morgan. 'They are truly an inspiration and blessing. 'The love being shown to our little girl is amazing and leaves us speechless.'

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . It's the childhood hobby adored by adults in search of a stress buster: Colouring in is officially the new hobby du jour and boasts increasing numbers of fans. And nowhere is it more popular than in France, where colouring books are, astonishingly, now outselling cookery tomes. Now the trend has arrived on these shores, with scores of adults-only colouring books featuring elaborate designs hitting shelves. Popular: Colouring in is the new hobby du jour and devotees say it's the ultimate adult stress-buster . Popular: Creative Therapy Colouring Book (£9.09, Michael O' Mara) is one of the new wave . With titles like Vintage Patterns: Creative Colouring for Grown-ups and Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure, the new look colouring books are a world away from the simple tomes enjoyed by children. But the new trend isn't all about being creative. Many more are targeted at men and women hoping to combat stress. 'There’s . something about just colouring that’s incredibly relaxing and . satisfying at the same time,' confirms Fiona Slater, a 30-year-old colouring in fan from London. 'It doesn’t need much thought, apart from . selecting the colours which is crucial, and you can do it . for five minutes or hours at a time.' Among the . most recent additions to the de-stressing sub genre is The Art Therapy . Colouring Book (Michael O' Mara) which is billed as 'perfect for de-stressing and embracing . your inner creative'. Inside, . it is awash with elaborate patterns, many of which draw on delicate . traditional chinoiserie but reworked to maximise stress busting. Many of the converts to colouring in are professional women, Slater, for instance, is a senior editor at a publishing house, looking for new ways to unwind while also reliving happy childhood moments. 'It’s something my mum used to do when I was little so . the idea of adults getting busy with the colours isn’t new to me,' explains Slater. 'I just . think it’s a shame that it’s taken this long for people to really . appreciate that it’s not just for kids. But then perhaps my mum was a . bit of a pioneer in that respect.' Elaborate: Designs for adults are considerably more ornate than those for children as these pages reveal . Childhood favourite: Most of us have happy memories of afternoons spent colouring in as a child . Another adult devotee of colouring in, West Midlands teacher Jan Beck, 60, says she adored colouring in as a child and gets a similar sense of satisfaction when completing a picture now. 'As a child I always enjoyed colouring in,' she says. 'I . had a set of Lakeland crayons that I kept in the same order in the pack . so that I knew where each colour would be. 'I used to be really careful about making sure the colouring was within the lines of the picture or pattern . so I would be pleased with the finished item.' And for Mrs Beck, the appeal of colouring in hasn't changed much since her childhood. 'I love colouring as I get great . satisfaction from finishing a picture,' she adds. 'I find colouring very . relaxing and often colour while I'm watching the television or listening . to music. I like that each creation is individual to you - no-one else would colour it in the same way so it is unique.' Stress-busting: Thanks to its soothing properties, colouring in is now enormously popular with adults as well . And Mrs Beck and Ms Slater certainly aren't alone. According to publishing house Michael O' Mara, sales of colouring books have surged over the last nine months. 'Colouring is taking over from sudoku and crosswords as the adult way to pass some relaxing time on the train or the plane,' explains Chairman Michael O'Mara. 'It's fun and creative without being a strain on the grey cells, so it’s more relaxing and stress-free and there are clearly a lot of arty people out there.' 'Anyone who thinks it's a waste of time clearly hasn’t tried it for themselves,' adds Slater. 'If you’ve ever . scrawled a doodle on a pad while on the phone you’ve got time for . colouring in.'","Colouring in books are currently outselling cookery tomes in France .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . F&F's new collection may be sold in Tesco, but with its glossy Louis Vuitton-esque campaign and sumptuous faux furs, it looks fresh off the catwalks - and costs a fraction of the price. This season sees the label take on a high fashion feel with luxe fabrics, lace camis and soft cashmere  creating a luxurious and elegant new collection. There's longer hemlines for the more mature lady and 60’s-inspired mini skirts for the more daring dressers. Swanky! F&F, which is sold at Tesco, has unveiled its slick new campaign imagery, which is reminiscent of Marc Jacob's for Louis Vuitton (Coat, £40, cardigan, £65, chemise, £25) The brand have taken layering, which is key this season, into account with their offering of coats, sweaters, skirts and trousers in mixed fabrications. The collection moves from light to darkness in dramatic colour palettes of black and grey with dark berry shades and metallics. This is reflected in the moody campaign imagery reminiscent of Marc Jacobs' recent offering for Louis Vuitton starring Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger as ladies of the night. Luxe: Fur is offered in every size, shape and colour splashed across oversized coats and stoles (Coat, £65. trouser, £25, shirt, £14) High fashion: The delicate floral gowns, which come with floor length hemlines, offer a more subtle take on the season's artistic mood (Coat, £40, dress, £18) Who needs accessories? Metallics and heavily embellished clothes signal a new way to wear jewellery this season . Layer upon layer: The brand have taken layering, which is key this season, into account with their offering of coats, camis, sharp tailored blazers and faux fur stoles (Stole, £20, cardigan, £65, jacquard skirt, £18) Sheer black separates, which are mixed with heavier pieces, add a touch of 90’s goth, while embellishment and bejewelled fabrics add opulence to the heirloom gowns. While head-to-toe wooly knits dominated the catwalks, F&F's new drop, which lands in-store and online on September 1, lets you experiment with the trend offering fur, in every size, shape and colour splashed across oversized coats and stoles.

"By . Gemma Champ . A slim-fitting Egyptian cotton T-shirt in tomato red, chic under a nautical blazer or relaxed over jeans. Versatile, soft and beautifully made, you might guess it was from J.Crew, that American-to-the-core favourite of the preppy middle classes. In fact, it is made by Sunspel, a British brand that has been making basics since 1860, and is now headed by hot young British designer JW Anderson (best known for catwalk creations loved by Alexa Chung and Pixie Geldof). At £55 to J.Crew’s £29.50 (for a vintage-finish cotton T-shirt), it’s not quite designer prices, but it’s hardly High Street either — but then this isn’t Chinese tat produced by the billion, it’s from the Nottingham company that brought you James Bond’s classic polo shirts. British beauties: As shops stocked ever cheaper fast fashion, shopping for deals became a national pastime. However, high-quality British brands are making a come back. Pictured: Libby London dress, £190. Now Sunspel is having an extraordinary revival: worn by The Rolling Stones on tour and explorers in the Arctic, opening stores in hip parts of London and popping up in New York, it is leading the charge to bring British craftsmanship back to our High Street. A generation ago, the British High Street was just that: town centres filled with British-made fashion, providing skilled work and trustworthy quality. But in the Eighties, the lure of cheap factories in China and beyond proved irresistible. Home-grown staff were laid off, machinery was sold to the East and factories closed. Kate Hill, founder of MakeItBritish.co.uk, which collates information on products made in the UK, saw it all happen. ‘I worked as a buyer for 20 years, and saw my career change from sourcing everything from the UK to spending all my time in the Far East,’ she says. ‘I remember when we first bought from China, we thought they’d missed a zero off the price it was so cheap.’ As shops stocked ever cheaper fast fashion, shopping for deals became a national pastime. We boasted about what a steal we’d bagged, and shopped  at Primark because we were clever, not because we couldn’t afford better. ‘People used to spend a month’s earnings on their coat, and it would last years,’ says Kate. ‘Now we’ve got coats at Primark for £40. That would be unheard of a couple of decades ago.’ Buy British: A generation ago, the British High Street was filled with British-made fashion. Pictured: Colenimo vintage lace jaket, £119 . But the tide is slowly turning and for an increasing number of shoppers, long-lasting quality, guilt-free ethics and a lower benefits bill (thanks to more British jobs) feel like  a better return on their investment than pretty rags that fall apart after four or five washes. And a number of brands are happy to offer them the option. From big retailers such as Marks & Spencer and Topshop, who are starting to dip their toes back in British waters, to smaller companies, such as Sunspel, that have  doggedly pushed on for years. While such quality doesn’t come cheap — simply because the labour costs here are higher than in the Far East — if you do want to invest in the best of British, here’s where to look . . . Thanks to Britain’s tailoring heritage, suiting is generally a good buy — and not just at the high end. For basic but flattering shapes, quality fabrics and contemporary edge, look no further than Hotsquash (hot squash.com), based on innovative textiles that help regulate your body temperature. Its sexy ruched, knee-length dress (pictured, below left) is £95. For sophisticated tailoring in a pared-back palette, Libby London (libbylondon.com) hits the spot with its practical-but-pretty power-dressing: the Willow dress (main  picture), £190, comes in two dusty pinks and creates va-va-voom curves, and the pure silk shirts for £90 look graceful. Sleek, simple and stylish: Hotsquash dress, £95 . When it comes to evening wear, Paper London (paper london.com) has vivid, beautifully made silk pieces such as an emerald cocktail dress on sale at £225, or a Pucci-alike sweater dress for £175.While several High Street brands offer UK-made selections, from Jigsaw to John Lewis, more surprising is Topshop’s upmarket Unique collection. Highlights include silk jungle-print separates and a knee-length bamboo-print dress, £195, and a pale teal satin skirt at £95.In a not-dissimilar vein, tiny brand Colenimo (colenimo.com) uses exquisite fabrics, often British, to make classic-with-an-edge pieces such as a silk crepe-de-chine black dress with white collar  at £149, or a vintage lace jacket (above, left) at £119. Quintessentially British: Katherine Hooker jacket, £530 . It’s not just special buys — everyday items are made here, too. Welsh brand Hiut (hiutdenim.co.uk)  has boyfriend jeans for £125, while for a smarter look, Wizard Jeans (wizardjeans.com) has a bum-lifting midnight-blue bootcut for £95 or skinny jeans, £30. Wizard’s founder Sally Allen-Gerard, who brought her production back to the UK from China, describes the process as ‘a real uphill struggle . . . we take far less profit than normal, but we believe it’s the right thing to do’.And if you’re taken by the Anglophile aesthetic of Ralph Lauren, why not get the real deal — a hand-tailored hacking jacket (above) by Katherine Hooker (katherinehooker.com) at £530 or a high-necked tweed style at Maquien (maquiendesign.co.uk), £120.","British-made fashion is seeing an extraordinary revival .

"By . Martha Cliff . A redheaded man who was picked on throughout his schooldays for his bright ginger hair has beaten the bullies by creating a successful modelling career. Louis Evans, 22, was nicknamed 'Rusty' by his classmates and taunted for his bright red hair and freckled face. For Louis modelling had never been an obvious career option and his first job was in an office supply company as a cold caller. Louis Evans beat his high school bullies and has built a successful modelling career . Since the start of his modelling career Louis has appeared on the catwalks of London Fashion Week and in the pages of British Vogue . However, once Louis reached the age of 20 he blossomed into a striking high-cheekboned model and was signed up by a leading modelling agency - Booking Models. He has since appeared at London Fashion Week, on the pages of British Vogue, and has recently been grabbed by Milan agency - Independent Men - to take part in June's Milan Fashion Week. Louis, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said that it is his ginger hair, which was the reason he was bullied for years, that has made him so popular in Europe where red headed models are in high demand. Louis says his acne always got in the way of dating when he was younger, but when he reached the age of 20 it completely vanished . He said: 'In places like Milan, Spain and Greece they adore red heads and put them on a pedestal. 'I like to think it's the fact I'm slim, . tall and have the face that's got me noticed, but I think having red . hair does make me different.' However, having such distinctive hair wasn't always such a gift. Louis says that growing up in Lowestoft prior to his modelling career he was targeted for the way he looks. 'It was quite difficult growing up in a small town. People are very close-minded in Lowestoft. Louis never imagined a career on the catwalk with his first job being in an office supply company . Louis says that since moving to London his modelling career has gone from strength to strength . 'Back at home there were stereotypes about gingers and I had the wrong kind of attention. 'I didn't let it affect me though and I tried not to let it affect my confidence.' Although Louis tried not to let small minded bullies bother him, he does admit that having acne was a real hindrance in his teenage years. 'I always liked to think I was a bit . smooth but to be honest I sucked at getting girls. The worst thing is . that I had acne. I wished every day that it could be gone.' Louis was always picked on as a young boy with his red hair earning him the nickname Rusty . Louis' good looks blossomed very quickly once he got to 20 and he saw a complete change in a very small amount of time. 'I've got a photo from three years ago and I still have no cheekbones.

"By . Amanda Cable . Rushing around the room in a wide-eyed frenzy, knocking over the nest of tables on which my canapes had been neatly arranged and upon which my dismayed guests had rested their flutes of champagne, my son Charlie, then 11, was making New Year’s Eve 2012 a night to remember for all the wrong reasons. Worse, it was all my fault. Earlier in the evening, I had served a sweet-and-sour chicken Chinese takeaway — a family favourite — to Charlie, his twin brother, Archie, and their sister, Ruby. My husband, Ray, and I had had the same, and we’d all tucked into chocolate pudding afterwards. Every mother will recognise this scenario. Sweet: Amanda Cable decided to switch her sons' diet but found it had more sugar . An indulgent meal as a treat, followed by an over-excited child who, quite literally, bounces off the walls. But Charlie’s reaction to sugar was more than just excitement. It was toxic. And, from watching my son carefully, I could see that his worst episodes of bad behaviour and hyperactivity took place after he’d had a sugar binge. So, that very night, I decided to reform my family’s eating habits. Out with the sugary cereals and sweet treats, and in with wholegrains and cereal bars. I even ditched cow’s milk for the soya alternative. Such a change in diet was the only thing I could think of that might put Charlie on a more even keel — and improve my entire family’s health in the process. After all, if an occasional sugar splurge could have such a dramatic impact on him, what was it doing to the rest of us? So imagine my horror on reading yesterday’s findings that many of the ‘healthy’ alternatives I’d started to buy were actually doing my family more damage than before. Indeed, doctors and academics are so horrified by the hidden sugar epidemic they’ve dubbed sugar ‘the new tobacco’. The World Health Organisation’s recommended daily allowance (RDA) is 90g of sugar per day — 22.5 teaspoons. Charlie’s typical menu before gave him an overall daily total of 121.3 grams of sugar — a whopping 30-odd teaspoons. But I now realise the so-called healthy diet is even worse. Thanks to sugars hidden in them, I have managed to push his sugar content up to 152 grams each day — the same as 38 teaspoons. Charlie’s behaviour had been deteriorating since just after he turned ten. As a toddler, it was far easier to control his diet, and rather than sugary drinks, he would have only water or milk. The tantrums were few and far between. But as he grew older, he wanted what the other boys at school were having. Brand-name cereals, cartoon-branded juice drinks, and so on. I capitulated. And I’m ashamed to admit that every day he would eat the following: Coco-Pops for cereal, peanut butter on crumpets as a snack and a Fruit Shoot drink after school. And while I tried always to prepare healthy dinners, if I didn’t have time to cook from scratch, I would resort to ready-meals. It wasn’t ideal, but I made sure that I chose the very best, high-end options. Surely it couldn’t do much harm? But by the age of 11, these treats were taking their toll on Charlie’s behaviour. Making him spend just 45 minutes reading or doing homework would leave him angry and temperamental. Copybooks were often thrown across the room (by him) and our dining-room table was regularly banged in frustration (me and him). So our new regime began. The chocolate breakfast cereal was out and I brought in what I thought was a healthy alternative — oat-based cereal flakes. We ditched the white bread sandwiches and started having veggie soups and wholemeal bread for lunch. Ready-meals were ditched for home-cooked meat and vegetable stir-fries that used delicious shop-made sauces. I thought I would win the war on sugar. How wrong I was. Talking to registered nutritionist Angela Dowden, I have learned the bitter truth about my children’s sugar intake. These so-called healthy options contain so many hidden sugars that my son’s diet is actually worse than before. ‘A little sugar won’t do any harm,’ Angela tells me. ‘But some foods lower their fat contents, enabling manufacturers to bill them as “healthy”, and then add sugar to make them taste better. ‘It’s only when you inspect the food labels, which most parents don’t, that you realise you are being misled. ‘The recommended daily limit of sugar for an adult female is 90g, which is the same as for a boy of 12, like Charlie. But the lower you can get your sugar intake, while still enjoying your diet, the better.’ Amanda was shocked to discover that a can of Heinz soup contains 14.9g of sugar . Angela found that swapping the obviously sugar-loaded cereals, like Coco-Pops, which has nearly five teaspoons per 40g bowl with semi-skimmed milk, for the same amount of Special K Oats and Honey Cereal with ‘healthy’ soya milk, still delivered 2.65 teaspoons of sugar. ‘It may be sold as “healthy”, but Special K Oats and Honey Cereal still has 19g of sugar per 100g. NHS guidelines suggest that anything containing over 22.5g of sugar per 100g is “high”. So while this isn’t technically over, it’s close — and not the healthy option people think,’ says Angela. ‘It’s wiser to choose porridge. Better still, scrambled egg with mushrooms or tomatoes is a lower-sugar start to the day.’ So what about our new healthy lunch with cheese sandwiches ditched in favour of vegetable soups, with tuna and sweetcorn sandwiches made with wholegrain bread. Charlie’s favourite soup was Heinz tomato. But I am stunned to discover that this contains 14.9g of sugar, per 300ml can — equivalent to almost four teaspoons. Worse was to come. While I thought I’d picked a truly healthy sandwich, Angela tells me that it contains more than a teaspoon of sugar, thanks to the wholemeal bread. My healthy drinks also got the thumbs-down. Our new breakfast drink was a pre-packaged orange, mango and passionfruit smoothie, which I thought would help our vitamin intake without adding too much sugar. Wrong, as Angela tells me: ‘It contains 19.5g of sugar in a 250ml serving, which is four teaspoons of sugar. That’s more than a fifth of the daily RDA in a single drink.’ I’d also swapped the lunchtime Fruit Shoot drinks for a glass of Tropicana fresh orange juice. I need not have bothered. ‘A 200ml glass of orange juice contains 20g of sugar — almost exactly the same as the 22g of sugar within the Fruit Shoot,’ says Angela. ‘That’s five teaspoons in just one glass. You are far better sticking to water or milk. One small glass of fruit juice in one day is enough.’ Charlie’s original after-school snack was peanut butter on a crumpet, which contained more than a teaspoon of sugar. I’d ditched the peanut butter — too many additives and syrups, I thought — for the more natural-seeming honey, served on a bagel. What a mistake. Angela says: ‘There’s a massive 11g of sugar in just two teaspoons of honey. It’s pure sugar. And added to the 5.1g of sugar which is part of every bagel recipe, you are loading Charlie with more than three teaspoons of sugar in just one snack.’ And while I had been feeling smug that I no longer have any sort of posh ready-meal in my supermarket trolley, I would have been better off sticking with them. I had replaced them with shop-bought stir-fry sauces with fresh meat and veg to make quick dinners feel more ‘home-made’. What an error! These sauces are packed with sugar, too. Angela says: ‘While overall this is a healthy meal, you could choose a better option by checking the label. Those with sweet chilli contain more sugar. Your favourite black bean sauce contains 7.7g sugar per half jar — almost two teaspoons.’ So, despite my best efforts, Charlie has still been consuming 38 teaspoons of sugar per day — almost 16 more than his allowance. I am horrified by these results. By opting for home cooking, what I had thought were low-sugar breakfast options and snacks, I was actually doing more harm to my children’s health than good.","World Health Organisation’s recommended daily allowance (RDA) is 90g of sugar per day .

"By . Gemma Champ . The softness of the dustbag, the crush of the sugar paper as you unwrap it, then, finally, that unmistakeable scent of real leather - there’s something undeniably luxurious about the first touch of a designer handbag. And for most of us, such bags are the single designer item in our wardrobes - carefully stored among the fail-safe M&S trousers, sturdy Hobbs dresses and trendy Zara tops. The perfect once-in-a-lifetime investment or birthday gift, a quality designer handbag will not just stand the test of time, but look good whether you’re a size 8 or 18, and add a slick of polish to any High Street outfit. Scroll down for video . Hell for leather: Prices keep on rising, which means average shoppers are unable to indulge in designer labels . Yet our beloved designer handbags seem to be slipping from our grasp as prices sky-rocket. Chanel’s instantly recognisable and versatile Large Classic Flap Bag, for example, has increased by 70 per cent, to £2,740, in just five years. A natural leather Mulberry Bayswater, meanwhile, that cost £650 in early 2012 is now £895. An Alexander McQueen clutch, which cost £845 in 2012, will now set you back £995. And it’s not just at the very top of the market that prices are climbing rapidly. Even brands such as Gwyneth Paltrow’s favourite, Coach, which has traditionally sold bags with starting points of £200 to £300 - and enjoyed double-digit sales gains during the recession - are increasing their prices. In 2009, Coach was hailing its bright, breezy Poppy range - which combined colourful canvas, denim and leather - as a recession-proof bargain. But now it has hired British accessories maestro Stuart Vevers, formerly of Mulberry and Loewe, it has started throwing around figures that make Chanel look modest. ‘You can have a £3,000, £1,500 or £1,200 Coach bag in the future,’ the brand’s chairman Victor Luis recently told U.S. fashion industry bible Women’s Wear Daily. Unless it is fashioning these bags from gold, how can brands possibly justify prices rising so high? The simple answer is that the more accessible the ‘average’ shopper finds handbags, the less appealing they are to the very rich, who would prefer something a little more exclusive. And the big fashion houses are very, very busy chasing the very rich; specifically the roubles of the billionaire Russian oligarchs and the yuan of Chinese super-consumers. ‘There are a lot of extremely rich people in countries such as China and Russia, while in the West the wealthy have seen their incomes  rising far faster than the rest of us,’ says fashion and retail consultant Sandra Halliday, until recently  editor-in-chief at leading fashion forecaster WGSN. The price of Alexander McQueen's bags have increased by 18%. Costs going up means average middle-class consumers are unable to afford them . ‘This has created a market where shoppers don’t think twice about paying £1,000-plus for a bag — and buying a new one every season.’ For some brands, however, moving too far upmarket has backfired, most notably in the case of Mulberry.  Just over a week ago, its CEO -  and the man chiefly credited with the decision to take the brand upmarket - Bruno Guillon, resigned. Mulberry’s share price had plummeted 60 per cent in two years, wiping millions from the value of the company. Commentators believe the move backfired as most of the company’s customers, some two-thirds it is estimated, are British. And those customers, according to TV fashion commentator and personal stylist Lisa Talbot, feel abandoned by the brands they have trusted  for years. ‘They’re alienating the core middle-class customer,’ she says. ‘They’ve abandoned the middle market, which just wants quality and style at a decent price. As you get a bit older, you want nice things. But if you have worked hard to afford them, you also want value for  money. Instead, you’ve got Chanel bags at £2,500.’ Hermes once sold a bag for £75,000. It was made of matt crocodile and anti-scratch calf leather . The design houses themselves claim that the rising cost of leather twinned with additional costs in production are to blame. ‘Essentially, the whole world now wants real leather, from the High Street up to Chanel. But there are only so many cows to produce it,’ says Rae Jones, a trends analyst. Mulberry cites this as one of the reasons its prices have risen, along with its ongoing return of production to Britain. It had been producing around 80 per cent of its leather goods in Turkey, but now is aiming to make at least 50 per cent on UK soil, having just opened a new factory in Somerset. But Mrs Middle-England can no longer afford it. Jilly Hope, 67, a retired office administrator from Streetly, Staffordshire, has been buying ‘posh handbags’ for years - she now has about 40 - but as prices climb towards £1,000, she knows she will now have to forego her annual luxury purchase.Her first Mulberry tote cost around £500 when she bought it a couple of years ago, and it wasn’t long before she’d bought another. There are still some advantages to investing in a top-end designer item, such as this Louis Vuitton bag . ‘I took a big gulp at the cash register, but I’ve used them every day and they always look good,’ says Jilly. ‘A really beautiful handbag elevates an outfit, even if you’re dressed casually. But I’d need to have a very, very, very good reason to pay £900 for one. Some brands have forgotten about their old customers as they go after international jetsetters.’ For so many of the international rich, status is king. Boutiques in prestigious streets, limited runs in rare leathers, collaborations with stars . . . it all adds to the cost, and it’s all in the name of exclusivity. ‘There are enough people who will just pay the extra and not notice, but there are also people who will actually feel better for having paid more,’ says Rae Jones. ‘That’s  essentially who Chanel, Balenciaga and their like are appealing to.’ While luxury handbag prices soar out of our price range, other brands are jostling to fill the mid-market gap: LK Bennett set out to design a mid-priced must-have with its lovely Rosamund (designed by the actress Rosamund Pike) last year, which starts at £350; and Aspinal of  London and Osprey are both contesting the £500-ground vacated by Mulberry. Certainly, while Coach’s prices remain (reasonably) reasonable, it seems it can expect sales figures to rise. Amanda Scott, head of women’s accessories at John Lewis, says, ‘We have seen a significant uplift in mid to premium-priced bags. ‘Coach only launched at John Lewis in October but we expect to see growth of almost 40 per cent for the last quarter, while other  brands such as Michael Kors have seen a 360 per cent uplift versus  last season.’ Now High Street brands are getting in on the bag-flation act, too. Whereas just a few years ago, you could easily find a decent leather bag on the High Street for around £60, now Reiss, Whistles, Jaeger, Hobbs, Ted Baker, French Connection, Zara and even Topshop are  all ramping up prices to the £150 to £300 mark - prices most  people would only be comfortable paying for something decidedly more premium. Nevertheless, there are still some advantages to investing in a top-end designer bag, if you can afford it. The resale value on a well cared-for bag can be astonishing. In May 2012, a crocodile Hermes birkin fetched £40,000 at auction. After all, for handbag conoisseurs such as Jilly, the purchase of a bag is not about the name or the price, but ‘the pleasure I get from it’.","Designer handbags are rocketing up in price .

"By . Angela Epstein . For hospital patients, the nights are often the loneliest, bleakest time. For Caroline Attrill, the night after surgeons found a worrying ‘abnormality’ was possibly the worst of her life. Caroline, then 25 and a mother of two, had undergone routine surgery to repair a prolapsed womb — but during the operation, surgeons had spotted a growth near her bladder that needed to be removed as soon as possible. It was frightening news. ‘I’d gone into hospital to have a routine op and now there was this “abnormality” — I was petrified it was cancer,’ recalls Caroline. Exceptional: Nurse Gemma Pearson (left) and Caroline Attrill (right) Her anxiety was understandable — over the previous ten years the receptionist from Southampton had suffered more than 300 kidney infections, with no obvious cause. Despite her anguish, ‘not a single nurse or doctor came to see me that night to explain what was going on’, says Caroline. ‘My husband, Mark, had left because visiting hours were over and I just felt so scared and alone. I spent the night crying my eyes out — I even phoned my mum at 3am, begging her to come and get me. She rang the nurses’ station and that was the only time a nurse came to see me. ‘I was really distressed, yet the nurse basically told me off and almost pushed me back to bed.’The next morning a young nurse starting her shift caught sight of a clearly distraught Caroline. ‘She appeared by my bed like some kind of angel,’ she recalls. ‘She was just so comforting, asking me what was wrong, and reassuring me she would sort everything out. She hadn’t even taken off her coat, but started looking over my notes and explained what had happened during the operation. She also arranged for the surgeon to come and see me. ‘And, despite having other patients to see to, this nurse was by my bed, on and off, for ages — even through her lunch break. She made me believe everything would be all right.’ The nurse was Gemma Pearson. Over the next ten months, Caroline was admitted to hospital nearly 20 times, but the dedicated care she received from 24-year-old Gemma helped her through this. That’s why Caroline is nominating Gemma for the Daily Mail Health Hero awards. ‘It’s not just her empathy that makes Gemma stand out,’ says Caroline. ‘She goes out of her way to care, anticipating what you might want, how you might feel. ‘She’d come to check on you just to see how you were. The other nurses did the medical things, but didn’t really speak to us; she did both. When she was on the ward, everyone cheered up and felt better. ‘I was the youngest patient by far, and with the older patients, Gemma would make sure they’d eaten properly, cutting their food up for them, or feeding them, to keep their strength up. ‘She’d search out fortified drinks for those who couldn’t eat, bringing back a selection of flavours, rather than just making them have what she’d chosen. She’d find chairs for relatives to sit on. 'It's not just her empathy that makes Gemma (pictured left) stand out,' says Caroline (right). 'She goes out of her way to care, anticipating what you might want, how you might feel.' 'I just do what I can to try to bring something positive to whatever it is that my patients are going through. That's what we have to do as nurses' explains Gemma (pictured) ‘She would also stay after her shift had finished to make sure her patients were OK. She even came in on her day off to check on me. She made such a difference. ‘Before I met Gemma, my faith in the NHS was non-existent — she restored it.’ Two days after her operation, Caroline was discharged from the Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton, facing the prospect of another operation to investigate and remove the ‘abnormality’ once she’d recovered properly. Adding to her worries was the news that the catheter which had been inserted to drain urine from her bladder would have to remain for the foreseeable future. ‘I was already anxious about my next operation, and now I felt so humiliated that I was going to be hooked indefinitely to a bag — I was only 25.’ It was Gemma who was there to comfort her and explain. Two days later, on Christmas Eve, Caroline was rushed back into hospital in agonising pain, caused by a blockage in the catheter. She spent Christmas Day not at home with her husband and their two sons, Alexander, now five, and Benjamin, four, but in hospital. ‘Even though I felt so ill, I was miserable about not being at home. But Gemma spent as much time with me as she could. ‘And when the children were allowed a brief visit, she made balloon animals out of surgical gloves, drew pictures on napkins and played games with the cardboard sick bowls. She tried so hard to make us all feel better.’ Caroline is now is nominating nurse Gemma for the Daily Mail Health Hero awards . Caroline returned to hospital last February to have investigative surgery — this revealed that her ‘abnormality’ was actually a 5cm cyst. That was the good news. ‘When I woke up from the operation, I was racked with pain,’ she says. ‘But what made things worse was I’d been led to believe the growth had been the cause of all my problems and I wouldn’t need a catheter any more. ‘But it was still there and I was told it might have to stay for good because of the damage to  my urethra. ‘I felt utterly wretched. But as soon as I got back to the ward, Gemma was there, reassuring me, talking me through everything.’ Caroline had to undergo two more investigative operations, and each time, she says, she was overwhelmed by Gemma’s unstinting care and devotion. ‘Once she came to see me on the day she was off work and going on holiday, saying she just wanted me to know that she was always there for me,’ Caroline says. Matron Carol Gosling, who works alongside Gemma at the Princess Anne Hospital, says her colleague ‘deserves both the plaudits and the nomination of health hero’. ‘Gemma goes above and beyond to make sure her patients always come first. Many times I’ve seen her work through her break or stay late because she wants to make sure she can personally see that everything is done for a particular patient,’ she adds. 'Once she [Gemma, pictured right] came to see me on the day she was off work and going on holiday, saying she just wanted me to know that she was always there for me,' Caroline (left) says . ‘There are a lot of good nurses, but Gemma nurses as much with her heart as with the practical skills and knowledge she has learned. She’s an exceptional nurse and a credit to the profession.’ Gemma says: ‘Nursing is easy because it’s something I feel so passionately about.’ She puts it down to the death of her 14-year-old cousin in a motorbike accident when she herself was a teenager. ‘I spent a lot of time with my aunt, his mother. I saw how she struggled to come to terms with what had happened, and I felt I needed to do something with my life to help other people when they were having such difficulties.’ ‘I just do what I can to try to bring something positive to whatever it is that my patients are going through. That’s what we have to do as nurses.’ Moved by her example, in January Caroline quit her job as a receptionist at a gym to work with elderly and vulnerable people. ‘I was so inspired by watching the way Gemma cared for others and the difference she made,’ explains Caroline, now 26. ‘I wanted to be able to do for others what she had done for me. Everything I do in my new job — whether it’s explaining things carefully to frightened elderly people or giving what comfort I can — is down to watching Gemma at work. ‘Gemma’s an exceptional person who genuinely cares about your health. And she’s helped me deal with whatever my fate may be. She’s unique.’","Caroline, then 25 and a mother of two, had undergone routine surgery .

"By . Deni Kirkova . It's a photographic series that captures a small but utterly fascinating slice of 1960s life and style.

"By . Kathryn Blundell . There are some counter-intuitive beauty tricks that you can understand might just work — massaging skin to prevent wrinkles or applying your conditioner before your shampoo for bigger hair. And then there are some that are just bonkers. At least that was my reaction when I heard Mary Berry’s recipe for near-perfect skin at 79, which I assumed would comprise an entire arsenal of potions to ensure her skin is as bouncy as one of her souffles. But no. The secret to her success is, basically, nothing. Mary Berry, 79, has near perfect skin; but she doesn't use any face creams . ‘I don’t have any beauty regime,’ she said in a recent interview. ‘I just use  one foundation, one powder, one lipstick. Why bother? I don’t use any face creams at all.’ The very thought of going without moisturiser almost brought me out in a rash, but I was intrigued that someone could forego it entirely and not look craggier than a cliff face — not least because my own skincare regime costs me dearly. There’s my two day moisturisers: Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Oil-Free Lotion (£34) to tackle the oiliness around my T-zone, and Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Cream (£80), which promises to target signs of ageing. Then a good eye cream: Boots No7 Youthful Eye Serum (£19.50), which I pat on religiously every morning. At night, I add Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream (£26), to soothe dryness. In all, my moisturisers cost me close to £160 every four months. That alone was enough to entice me to put Mary’s method to the test. For a month I decided to pack all my potions away and, after washing with Liz Earle Cleanse & Polish (£13.25) cleanser morning and night, do nothing else. Of course, I’m concerned any savings will come at the expense of irreversible skin damage. And, at 40, that’s a risk I can scarce afford. Kathryn when she was still using face creams . But at the same time I, like every woman I know, have a sneaking suspicion I’m being sold a pup by the beauty industry. The average woman will spend £18,000 on skincare in a lifetime but, deep down, I suspect we all know that no amount can really stop the ravages of time. And, of course, I wondered if  all my unguents were actually making my skin worse: after all, the cocktail of chemicals I slather on every night is far from natural. ‘We tend to overcomplicate skincare,’ says cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting. ‘Men often do little more than splash water on their face; by comparison, women often create problems by embracing trends that don’t necessarily suit their skin type.’ My month-long trial would begin with a test to assess the condition of my skin, then another one four weeks later to assess any change. At London’s Cosmetic Imaging Studio, Nicolas Miedzianowski-Sinclair uses a Visia device to analyse my skin for sun damage, wrinkles, redness and pore size. It’s a mixed bag: my wrinkles are good for my age, but my moisture levels are low (galling considering all that time and money) and my pores and redness are particularly bad. But it is the fact the machine says I have UV damage — the thing that ages skin most drastically — that alarms me the most. I’m dreading the month ahead. For the first week, I sorely miss my moisturisers. After every wash, my skin feels tight and flaky. But by midweek, I realise my foundation has much greater staying power and my skin is staying matte for longer. Still, I dread the tightness that appears after the smallest splash of water — so I avoid washing it off for as long as possible. The sensation makes me super-aware of my skin. I’m used to carrying on with my day without giving my face a second thought, but without moisturiser I can concentrate on little else. On the Monday of the second week I meet a friend for lunch. I recoil as she examines my face. ‘I can’t see any differences,’ she mutters. ‘Maybe I can ditch the creams, too?’ The most expensive moisturiser in the world, by Cle de Peau Beaute, costs £8,500 for a 50g pot . However, the tightness has been joined by an angry community of spots on my chin — Sam says this can be common on first giving up moisturiser as skin produces excess oil to compensate. After three weeks my skin feels a little rougher. My make-up now sits on newly formed outcrops of dry skin on my cheeks and around my nose. But otherwise I’m pleasantly surprised — my skin looks clearer and creamier, and I’ve even started to forget about the tightness. I also stop worrying that people can tell, as if going without moisturiser is some dark secret. After all, it’s so ingrained in our routine that to say you skip it is tantamount to saying you don’t care about your appearance. At last, when the month is up I race to my second consultation with Nicolas, safe in the knowledge that as soon as I get home I can bathe myself in Elemis. I expect to be told that my skin is wizened and damaged in some way, but I’m shocked by the results. Some, I was expecting; he can immediately see the skin damage from a spell in the sun during the first week, when I forgot I wasn’t wearing my SPF-containing cream. Kathryn after a month of not using face creams . My skin also has around 10 per cent less moisture and the wrinkles around my eyes have deepened. I can live with dry skin, but wrinkles are something I’ve spent money on trying to avoid — though Nicolas assures me these should plump back up with a good eye cream. There are, however, some surprising benefits. The redness has dramatically reduced and my pores are ten times less visible — a clear reversal of a key sign of ageing. Sam tells me that the tightness I felt after washing was because my cleanser was too harsh, disrupting the skin’s natural barrier. That’s easily solved by using a cream cleanser and a flannel. I now use Eve Taylor Clear Cleanse (£19.99). ‘Creams also plump up wrinkles, making them less obvious, but they won’t stop them forming,’ Sam says. ‘The reduction of pores may be down to them being clogged by creams. Most people just need good sun protection, which has moisturising properties itself. ‘All women should apply healthy scepticism when deciding if a product’s claims are plausible,’ she adds. ‘What we do know is that a product as simple as an inexpensive moisturiser can improve the appearance of fine lines and that many “anti-ageing” creams are doing little more than that.’ I’ve come to the conclusion that my moisturiser buying has been hugely influenced by fear. Fear of looking old, fear of flakiness. Now I see past the beauty companies’ spin I know exactly what my face needs — a decent SPF (which will keep tightness at bay, too) and an eye cream to keep those wrinkles plumped. But that’s it. And at £15.50 for both, my bank balance, as well as my skin, is already thanking me.","Mary Berry, 79,  says her recipe for perfect skin is to not use face creams .

"By . Catherine Hardy . Abbey Clancy has been voted as the owner of the best legs in showbiz. The model, who is the face (and legs) of Veet and Scholl, also scooped third place in the best feet awards, while TV presenter Holly Willoughby topped the pedi poll, coming second in the best legs category. Kelly Brook, Tess Daley, Emma Willis and Cat Deeley were also named as having fabulous pins and tootsies. Scroll down for video . Perfect pins: British women named Abbey as having the best legs in showbiz . The survey by Veet found that although British women admire the petite scouser’s long legs they are shy when it comes to showing off their own. Hairy legs, pale skin and hard skin on feet particularly leave British women unwilling to make the most of the sun and the survey found that almost half of women will cover up their legs by wearing jeans instead of skirts.

Feeling embarrassed and lack of time are also reasons women . are deciding to take grooming into their own hands. Hairy no more: British women named lack of tan and hairy legs as the top reasons for staying covered up . ‘As a model I have learnt how to take care of my body and make sure it’s always looking its best’, says Abbey. ‘I feel most confident when I’ve carried out my beauty basics such as waxing and foot care. It’s not just about how great your legs and feet look, but how you feel once they are prepped and ready to bare as soon as the sun comes out.' 'Any mum with a full time job knows that fitting in time to do even the simple things like going to the gym and shops can be a struggle, never mind finding the time to visit a salon.

"By . Katy Winter . Beauty pageants have become just as discussed for their anti-feminist message as for the attributes of the contestants. Despite many feeling the bikini portion of the competition is demeaning to women, the contestants in this year's Miss England beauty pageant seemed happy to show off their bodies as they posed for the swimwear round, which makes up one part of the contest, the winner of which will go onto the Miss World pageant. They are are all hoping to follow in the . footsteps of the reigning Miss England, Kirsty Heslewood, 24, who . joined them in Torquay, Devon, for a photoshoot on the deck of a luxury . yacht. Scroll down for video .

The annual beauty contest is staged in Torquay, with the swimwear portion being photographed in the famous marina, and the winner will be crowned later this month . The hopefuls included Karina Tyrrell, 24, who is studying medicine at Cambridge University, and blonde psychology graduate Leanne Carroll, 23, from Cheshire. Another of the girls, Miss Cornwall, . Emma Smith, 22 was bullied at school because of a lazy eye - but turned . the tables on her tormentors by getting straight As in her A-levels and . going to medical school. Constants this year include medical students as well as psychology students, dancers  and trainee accountants . The women seemed to be enjoying the photo shoot, despite the rather unpredictable British summertime weather . The young models lapped up the sun on the deck of a yacht before heading to nearby Torre Abbey Beach for more photos . They are among 60 finalists who have been picked from heats across the country and a final winner will be crowned in June. The annual beauty contest is staged in Torquay where last year local MP Adrian Sanders said it was an 'own goal' for women. Founder of the Miss England competition Angela Beasley argues that despite appearances: 'It's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty' Miss Nottingham, Rebecca Drysdale and Miss English, Riviera Leanne Ward (left) and Miss London, Tammy Dexter and Miss Hampshire, Charlotte Giles, splash around in the waves (right) His comments were dismissed by a previous winner Charlotte Holmes, from Torpoint, Cornwall, who said this was precisely the sort of stereotyped view the girls were hoping to challenge. And the woman behind the Miss England contest has come to its defence. Director Angela Beasley said accusations that the contest was inappropriate nowadays were old-fashioned. The swimwear round of the competition was launched on Monday at Torquay Marina amid reports there was unease that it was getting a £7000 subsidy from Torbay Council to stage the show. But Angela Beasley said the view that beauty pageants were degrading was outdated. The contestants have their own Baywatch moment as they run out of the no doubt rather chilly English sea onto the beach . She said: 'We've come a long way from girls just turning up with their heels and swimsuit and walking on a catwalk to be judged. 'Now girls take part in various rounds including a tough sports round - you have to be physically fit. 'The current Miss England ran the London Marathon this year and raised thousands of pounds for childrens' charities. 'Miss England is about being a good role model. 'There's a talent round where the girls submit their talent - what they think they're good at. 'They have to be good at something - it could be their jobs or something they enjoy doing. 'There's an eco-fashion round where the girls have to create an outfit using recycled materials - they have to be creative. As well as the swimwear round, the competition now includes a sports round and an Eco-fashion round . Miss London Tammy Dexter, Miss Bristol Naomi Dunbar and Miss Leicestershire Holly Desai enjoy frolicking for the camera . Despite many feeling the bikini portion of the competition is demeaning to women, the 14 contestants showed off their bodies with seeming joy . 'It's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty. 'Modelling competitions are about just looks alone. 'Miss England is about being a good all rounder and a good role model. This year alone we had 20,000 girls apply to enter the competition. 'When people stop applying to be a role model we'll stop holding the competition.' Current Miss England Kirsty Heslewood also said she felt the pageant was positive. 'I feel it empowers women to do good things for their country, their communities and be good role models. 'It's completely changed from how it used to be. 'It promotes fitness and good health.'","Some of final 60 contestants posed for photos following swimwear round .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . and Ruth Styles . At first glance, Lou Street, a 39-year-old mother of four, from Gravesend, doesn't appear to have a care in the world. But appearances can be deceptive and the reality is quite different. Although she looks healthy, this summer will be the last Lou and her family will ever enjoy together. 'What's killing me is motor neurone disease and the medication,' she explains. 'I've been told I only have a year to . go but I don't believe it. We'll see!' Brave: Lou Street, 39, is dying of motor neurone disease and plans to spend her last months with her family . Lou was diagnosed with motor neurone . disease, a degenerative condition that attacks the nervous system, on the 23rd December 2010 and told that she had just over two years to live. Three years on, Lou, who appears on tonight's Channel 4 documentary, My Last Summer, believes she has at least one year left, which she plans to spend with her husband John and her two youngest children, Ria, nine, and Mimi, six. 'I didn't want them to think I was keeping things from them,' reveals Lou, who told her family, including her two older children from a previous relationship, of the diagnosis immediately after finding out. 'I've never done that before so why start now?' While Mimi appears to be coping with her mother's illness, Ria took it badly and in a heartbreaking scene in My Last Summer, reveals that she wishes she hadn't been told. 'It was a shock,' says the nine-year-old, who says that she would 'be more happier' if she didn't know anything.' While Ria struggles to come to terms with the prospect of losing her mother, Lou herself has thrown herself into planning her last weeks and even her funeral. Brave: Lou (second right) with (from left) Andy, Jayne, Ben and Junior, who also appear in the documentary . 'I have made a decision,' she reveals. 'If I can't . swallow, you don't feed me, if I can't breathe, you won't make me breathe - I . don't want that stuff. 'I don't want to end up paralysed with a feeding tube and a breathing machine. You can go on for a very long time like that. 'When it comes to when I can't physically speak or can't move, I'll be too far gone for me to change anything about it -  I'll be stuck.' Her funeral plans include a party led by a celebrant who will help her family relive happy memories and deliver her final goodbye from beyond the gravee. That, however, doesn't make the prospect of leaving her family behind, the two youngest girls in particular, any easier. 'The only thing I'm scared of [about dying] is who's going to find me and how will my children will cope. Mimi and Ria are young. Daddy . isn't going to plait their hair and give them the motherly chat about . periods. Tragic: Of the five to appear in My Last Summer, Lou is one of only two still alive to enjoy summer 2014 . 'And my fear is, he's going to make the wrong choice,' she says . stopping mid-sentence, her voice cracking. 'It . hurts knowing that someone else is going to have to step into my shoes . to be a mother to my children - and not knowing who they are. 'Because . you don't know if they're going to do right -- if they're actually . going to love them right. They need someone. He's a fantastic dad - but . he's not a mother. I wish I could meet them [potential step-mother] now. I'd like to choose . them, but John would have a fit!' Lou, ordinarily so composed, wells up. 'I'm dying...' she adds, her voice wobbling. 'My body's dying, my inside and my heart are dying - when I look at my children and when I can't do things with them. 'You've got to look it and say, ""What would be the best thing?"" The best thing would be to survive it. But it's not going to happen. It's not. It's just going to get worse and worse.'

"By . Ruth Styles . Gnomo Orzo is a man with a plan. A member of Italy's reclusive Damanhur community, Mr Orzo is helping pioneer one of the group's most controversial technologies: time travel. 'We go in the past very, very long ago, very, very far away, because if . you go very  close to your present, you change a lot of events in your . present,' he explains of his inter-dimensional travels. 'This is very dangerous for your present.' This is not the first time the Damanhurians have claimed to have cracked the secret of time travel - they first did so in 1997 but, thanks to the controversy that ensued, have remained silent ever since. Spiritual: The Damanhur eco community of Piedmont claims to have created a working time machine . Now the reclusive group, which is based in a series of small communities in Piedmont in Italy, has agreed to reveal more about their much-disputed technology in a new documentary. 'It’s like a machine but it’s not only machine, it’s not only physical.. there are energies inside,' adds Mr Orzo of his time machine. 'You have only a present, so in the past, you have the body, while here, all that is left behind is mass.' But time travel isn't the only unusual (and as yet unproven) technology that the Damanhurians have to offer. Founded in 1975 by Oberto Airaudi, the Federation of Damanhur, as it's officially known, combines neo-pagan beliefs with a passion for nature - both of which inform their activities. Unusual: Damahurian Formica (left) appears on new documentary, Outsiders With Darren McMullen . Feat: This might look like an ordinary Piedmontese home but beneath it is an extraordinary rock cut temple . Eco-friendly: According to Formica, the temples are dedicated to the earth and biodiversity . Beneath the Damanhurians' countryside complex is a network of rock-cut temples, built by hand in the 70s, and completely unknown to the Italian government until 1992. 'They are dedicated to the planet and the biodiversity,' explains Formica, a member of the Damahurians' Piedmont community. The most famous of the temples, which sit 72m below the ground, is the blue temple, which was built by had using picks and shovels and contains a mystical blue sphere. 'This blue sphere we use to take inspiration,' adds Formica. 'But mainly for finding the . answers that we think we have inside ourselves.' The religious aspect of Damanhur life combined with lurid claims about time travel and the community's insistence that new members take the name of a plant or animal when they join has led to accusations that instead of a community, the Damanhur leaders are running a cult. Formica, who has lived in the community for more than three decades, is less than impressed. 'No absolutely not,' she exclaims. 'You know a cult is a very . closed place but here are a lot . of people coming and going - we have many visitors. 'Damanhur was born to bring together the dreams of many people. To create something new. Something never imagined before.' Despite her protests, there's no denying that some elements of Damanhur life verge on the bizarre, not least their penchant for playing music with plants. One of the Damanhur's many fields of experimental research, the plant-based jam sessions, take place in treehouses and use detectors to channel the plant's 'music'. Founder: Oberto Airaudi, an Italian philosopher who died last year, founded the Damanhur in 1975 . Structure: Esperide (Butterfly), left, is Minister of Foreign Affairs, while the outdoor temple is used for rituals . 'This is the music of the plants,' says Macaco, a friend of Formica who chose to be named after the Macau monkey. 'They are incredible.' Explaining how the Damanhurs play the music of the plants, she says: 'There is one detector on the leaf and there’s another detector which is close to the roots. It measures the electric conductivity of the plant.' This digital data is then fed into a converter which assigns notes to each plant's electrical impulses which than then be played out loud. 'So it’s the human being that gives the sound to the plant,' adds Macaco, 'but it’s the plant that chooses the notes. 'They like certain kinds of . music and they don’t like other kinds of music so much. If they don't like something, they will stop playing.' Formica, Macaco and Gnomo Orzo appear on Outsiders with Darren McMullen, Friday night at 10pm on National Geographic .","The Damanhur Federation is an eco community based in Piedmont in Italy .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Whether it’s a quick dip before breakfast or a cheeky stroll along the red-light district, these tiny holidaymakers are making the most of the hot weather. And although David Gilliver’s little people are only 2cm tall, the world is their oyster in his latest collection of work. Gilliver, a Guernsey-based finance worker, spends hours scouring the internet for the miniature figurines, before setting up the surreal scenarios. Sweet seduction: In 'Amsterdam' artist David Gilliver uses Starburst sweets to recreate the infamous red-light district . And although the figurines are usually used on model railway sets, Gilliver has far more interesting jobs for the little people. His latest pictures show them in situations such as playing golf with hundreds and thousands and watering the gigantic bluebells. But it’s not all fun and games - for these little chaps, tending to a 5 square metre garden is a mammoth task. The 34-year-old said: 'I shot the latest set of photographs over the past couple of months and so I have been able to utilise things like Daffodils and Bluebells in some of the work. 'Dexter Season 9' recreates a bloody murder scene from artist David Gulliver's favourite crime series . Go Figure! 'Match.com' is one of artist David Gilliver's pieces using 2cm-tall figurines, which he trawls the internet to find . 'It’s nice to keep some of the work relevant to when it was made. 'My wife and I visited Amsterdam back in April and the infamous red light district was just begging to be recreated using an amusing diorama. 'In this instance Starbursts act as the platforms from which the ladies try to entice their male spectators.' Each scenario takes Gilliver around 90 minutes to set up and photograph. He started creating the miniature dioramas over 10 years ago during his Fine Art Photography degree at the Glasgow School of Art. Artist David Gilliver's work, humorously named, 'Jill could not believe that Pete did not like butter' He said, 'Miniature figurines have always fascinated me and I take a lot of enjoyment from thinking up new ideas about how I can use them next. 'I always joke with people, saying that I obtained my degree by playing with toys, which on the face of it, is difficult to argue against. 'I am a very keen landscape photographer, and I think my initial interest was born out of an effort to find a completely different style of photography to interest myself in.' Although renowned for its humour, Gilliver’s latest body of work has taken a more sinister turn. 'Watering the bluebells' shows a little man hard at work atop a stem . A golfer does his best with spilt hundreds and thousands in David Gilliver's piece called 'FOUR!' Most notable is the blood-splashed murder scene inspired by the dark TV series ‘Dexter’. Gilliver said, 'My wife and I were massive fans of the TV series Dexter, and when it finished for good I decided to dedicate one of my miniature set-ups to the show we loved. 'Maybe the murderer in my mini-series could be called ""The Sewing Kit Killer""?' Murder scenes aside, Gilliver hopes that the little people would be happy in their roles. He said, 'Hopefully they would thank me for allowing them to fulfill their potential in the various scenarios they find themselves placed in.' But adds, 'Or maybe they would tell me to stop being so silly.' 'Fishing for cod' (left) and 'Thinking About Allsorts...' (right) put Gilliver's 2cm-high people into percpective .

"By . Bianca London . Barefoot, ties askew and ball dresses stained and tattered, the students of Trinity College clattered through the streets of Cambridge after a night celebrating the end of exams at the traditional May Ball. But most weren't going home, even though dawn had most definitely broken. Still clad in rather worse-for-wear dinner jackets, top hats and . glamorous floor-length dresses, hordes of students prepared to carry on . the celebrations with drunken punt rides on the River Cam or breakfast . in college gardens following the £300-a-ticket event. Judging by today's pictures, the students were sticking faithfully to this year's mantra, which, according to the official website, was 'Eat, Drink, Rave, Repeat.' Scroll down for video . Man down! Cambridge University students toasted the end of exams at the famous Trinity May Ball but it all got too much for some with one reveller choosing to take a small power nap in the street . It's getting hot out here! Clearly the warm June weather was just too much for some of Britain's brightest young minds, who decided to remove their clothes in the streets . These rather dishevelled ravers are, in fact, some of Britain’s most elite . students and judging by the alumni - who include Charles Darwin, Prince . Charles, David Attenborough and CS Lewis - they are the leaders and . thinkers of tomorrow. Academic high-fliers they might be, but the event did prove a little too . much for some of them, who were seen face down in the gutters of Cambridge or . stuffing their faces with sweets on the pavements. A few, however, were still immaculately dressed and seemed . relatively sober after enjoying a night of lavish entertainment. The black tie ball is the biggest event of the Cambridge student social calendar and marks the end of exams.

"By . Katy Winter . It is a special day in middle America when you step out of your front door and bump into the sister of British loyalty. But that was exactly what happened to nine-year-old Cayman Terbroc, who met a lycra clad Pippa Middleton who had stopped for a pit stop to change riders in Missouri during her Race Across America challenge. An athletic looking Pippa was happy to pose for pictures and chatted with Cayman and her mother Lisa, before asking them to help her cheer on her brother James, who is taking part in the race with her, as he rode past them. Scroll down for video . A glowing, tanned looking Pippa was happy to pose with a beaming Cayman, 9, during a pit stop in her mammoth 3000 mile ride across America . The gruelling test of endurance didn't seem to be taking too much of a toll on super-fit Pippa . Cayman and her mother Lisa bumped into Pippa and her brother James as they made a brief pit stop . The 30-year-old looked every inch the professional cyclist in her patriotic get-up of a blue, white and red lycra all in one, with sunglasses to help shield her eyes from the glaring sun. The Duchess of Cambridge's little sister also seemed to have topped up her tan during her challenge, sporting a healthy golden glow. She is only part way through her 3,000 mile ride across the United States as part of the Race Across America challenge. The charity ride kicked off in Oceanside, California, on Saturday, and the six participants are expected to arrive in Annapolis, Maryland, next Thursday. James Middleton, sporting a full mountain-man beard, joined his sister on the charity bike ride across America . Pippa smiles as she climbs back into the escort car with her brother to rest while others continue cycling . The Route: Race Across America takes place across 12 days, with cyclists venturing from Oceanside, California to Annapolis, Maryland . She will be joined by a team including her brother James, 27, and six other individuals, in aid of the Michael Matthews Foundation and the British Heart Foundation, according to People.com. The ‘ultra-endurance’ event promises to be a challenge even for ultra-fit Miss Middleton, who regularly takes part in charity races. In the race’s 32-year-history less than 200 individuals have successfully completed the event. Pippa, 30 and James, 27, appeared upbeat about the enormous challenge ahead of them before they set off on Saturday .

"By . Scarlett Russell . A Rwandan woman who survived her country's genocide in 1994, sought asylum in England and became a graduate of Oxford University is now the main inspiration behind a new novel. Liliane Umubyeyi, 35, who lives in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, witnessed her entire family murdered by members of the Hutu community during the war between April and July, in which an estimated one million people were killed. Next Friday will mark Liberation Day, the 20th anniversary of the atrocities ending. Survivor: Liliane Umubyeyi, pictured here, watched her family slaughtered during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. The war lasted between April and July of that year, during which an estimated one million people were killed . In the novel After Before by British author Jemma Wayne, the protagonist is Emily, an immigrant survivor of the Rwandan Genocide who fled to the UK, and was inspired by Liliane and her own story. Jemma, 34, from London, came up with the idea for After Before after attending an event in aid the charity SURF (Supporting Survivors of the Rwandan Genocide). She met Liliane and was struck by her tragic and courageous story. The genocide started after a plane carrying then President Juvenal Habyarimana - a Hutu - was shot down, killing everyone on board, on April 6 1994. Rwanda was then thrown into political unrest. Hutu extremists blamed the Tutsi rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and waged war on the Tutsi people. Liliane, who now lives in Kidlington, Oxfordshire was 15 at the time. She tells MailOnline how she climbed a tree for safety in the back garden of her uncle’s house in Kigali when it was ambushed by Hutu extremists. Inspirational: British writer and journalist Jemma Wayne, right, was so struck by the story of Rwandan genocide survivor Liliane, left, that she loosely based the protagonist of her new novel on Liliane's story . As Tutsis, Liliane’s family were all at risk, so she had been sent to live with her uncle for safety. But soon enough the entire family – Liliane and her father, four brothers, 16 cousins, grandmother and two uncles and aunts – were hiding out in same house. Liliane will forever be haunted by the day Hutu militants found them. ""They came to attack us with machetes. I thought at least if I ran they might shot me and I'd die quickly rather than bleeding to death"" ‘They had to search every house to take passports, they didn’t want anyone crossing the border,’ Liliane tells MailOnline. ‘They came to attack us with machetes. I thought at least if I ran they might shoot me and I'd die quickly. ‘I was scared of the agony of the machete and bleeding slowly to death.’ ‘I saw them come through the house and so ran out of the window to the backyard, hoping my family would follow me. I was shaking so much because I was so terrified, so couldn’t run that fast or bear to look back.’ Seeing solace in her uncle’s avocado tree, Liliane hid and watched, praying her family would escape as well. ‘From the tree I could see everything that was going on in the house,’ she says quietly. I saw them all killed. Every single one of my family in front of my eyes. 'They pulled the bodies out and left them in the garden. I stayed in the tree for hours, not knowing what to do. I had nowhere to go and nowhere to go back to.’ Eventually, Liliane crawled down and ran to the nearest houses. ‘I started knocking on doors. Some people closed the door in my face, others screamed. One woman let me stay one night in her house.’ The following morning Liliane left again and was found by Hutu militants, who chased her. Running on instinct, she came to a pit in the ground and jumped in. ‘They surrounded it, screaming at me to get out,’ she says. ‘ . I told them, “No, if you want to kill me the best place is here, do your business.” One jumped inside the pit, lifted me up. They didn’t kill me, though. I was very lucky. I think they took pity on me but I don't know why.’ ""I always wanted my story to be heard. It has given me courage. This is a way to learn from the past"" Liliane found another family friend, a woman who took her in and looked after her until the war was over and for years afterwards. The RPF, a trained Tutsi military group largely based in Uganda after, were able to enter Rwanda and slowly began take-over of the country. Only when the RPF had full control, did the genocide stop, in mid-July 1994. Liliane grew up without a family or knowing a word of English, living in a country ravished by war and left in poverty and disarray. In 2000, the family friend arranged for 20-year-old Liliane to be taken to France for a new and prosperous life, but arriving in London before connecting to France, Liliane was abandoned at Heathrow airport, with no idea where she was supposed to go and what she was supposed to do. ‘Authorities at the airport took me to a hotel nearby Heathrow where a translator talked to me as I could not speak a word of English,' she says. ‘A social worker put us in a house for six months whilst I claimed asylum. I went to school for two years, learnt English, made friends and started to rebuild my life.’ She applied to study at Oxford Brookes University in 2004. After Before by Jemma Wayne is out now, published by Legend Press, £7.99 . ‘I made friends with a woman from Congo because we could both speak French and she was going to Oxford and I told the people at the asylum hostel I was staying at that I wanted to go with her,’ she explains. Her asylum came through in 2005 and she began her undergraduate International Relations and Politics degree in 2010, graduating in 2013. During her time in England Liliane found love with a Nigerian boyfriend who she credits for, ‘helping me find love and re-build my life.’ The couple have two daughters; Ariella, two, and Anastasia, five. Liliane also became heavily involved with SURF, of which she is now a trustee. It was here she met writer and journalist Jemma. ‘I was looking for ideas for a novel and happened to go to a SURF event that my husband helped to organise,’ Jemma tells MailOnline. ‘I was struck by the enduring sense of betrayal in Rwanda. It was a tight-knit community where everyone shared the same culture and language and for friend to turn on friend and neighbour to turn on neighbour seemed so shocking. 'That really stuck with me. ‘I thought about other forms of betrayal and that’s how the stories in the book came together. I got in touch with Liliane who was so amazing and gave me such insight.’ Such was the impact of Liliane’s story that she inspired the character of Emily. Jemma continues: ‘Liliane’s voice kept coming back to me. The character Emily keeps having flashbacks to the genocide. I would imagine for someone who has been through that it’s something they have to try to live with and face every day. ‘It’s so important to keep talking about these things. By speaking and not letting the world forget, that’s our only chance to stop these things continuing to happen.’ Liliane adds: ‘I always wanted my story to be heard. This is a way to learn from the past. I was so happy when Jemma approached me. Telling my story has given me courage.’ After Before by Jemma Wayne is out now, published by Legend Press and available at amazon.co.uk, £7.99.

"By . Margot Peppers . A soon-to-be-launched logo will tell discerning shoppers if the products they are buying from Walmart were made by women. The stamp, which is designed to resemble a ring of women with their arms around each other, was developed by two nonprofits and Walmart, which will begin selling goods branded with the logo starting in September. Maggie's Salsa, which is owned by Maria Magdalena De La Cruz Cook-Garcia, lingerie brand Smart & Sexy and cleaning agent CLR are just some of the companies that will be represented in this new scheme. Look at the label: A soon-to-be-launched logo developed by Walmart and two nonprofits will tell discerning shoppers if the products they are buying were made by women . The initiative was inspired by recent research from Walmart which found that 90per cent of female shoppers specifically seek out products from women-owned businesses. Pamela Prince-Eason, chief executive of Women's Business Enterprise National Council, which helped developed the logo, told Bloomberg Businessweek that she expects it to fit shoppers' needs. 'People are looking for reasons to feel good about the company they're buying from,' she explained, comparing it to similar logos that indicate Kosher or Fair Trade products. She added in a Today interview that 18- to 34-year-olds are particularly likely to buy a product based on who made it. For women, by women: Maggie's Salsa, which is owned by Maria Magdalena De La Cruz Cook-Garcia, is one of the companies that will be represented in this new scheme . Appealing to the people: Research has found that 90% of female shoppers seek out women-made products. (Pictured: Left, CLR cleaning agent; right, Smart & Sexy lingerie. Both will soon bear the new logo) 'This is a group that cares very much about causes,' she explained. 'They tend to make consumer decision on just wanting to be supportive of women-owned businesses as much as they will on quality.' 'People are looking for reasons to feel good about the company they're buying from' Businesses need to be 51per cent owned or run by women and approved by Ms Prince-Eason's group as well as WEConnect International before they can use the logo. The move is part of Walmart's 2011 promise to source $20billion of goods from women-owned businesses by 2016. Ms Prince-Eason said that while Walmart is the first store to back the initiative, she is also in talks with several other retailers including Macy's and Office Depot.

"By . Katy Winter . A Naomi Campbell lookalike who was bullied at school for being 'too tall and nerdy' says she can't walk down the road without being pestered for autographs. Lystra Adams was constantly teased while at school in Montserrat for being taller than everyone else in her school and looking like a geek. The name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that the young Lystra used to suffer panic attacks before going to class. Lystra now works as a lookalike for the supermodel and is regularly stopped for autographs in the street . Naomi, pictured here working as a professional model, is often hired to attend events and treated like a star . Lystra, pictured age 16, was constantly teased while at school in Montserrat for being taller than everyone else in her school and looking like a geek . Now the 37-year-old stunner has conquered the bullies and has carved out a successful career in modelling and being the supermodel's lookalike. Striking Lystra said: 'I was constantly bullied at school - I was always tall and used to tower above most of the older boys, let alone girls my age, and I worse these thick glasses. 'This one girl - who thought she was a top dog - was always calling me names like 'freak' and 'nerd' and she used to lead everyone in whispering behind my back. 'It doesn't sound much, but when you're younger and just want to fit in the constant whispering and teasing caused me to have panic attacks every day before school. 'It was horrible and really knocked my confidence at the time but looking back it has made me a stronger person - all I think now is look at me now!' Astonishingly when Lystra arrived from Montserrat in 1997 - the height of the supermodel's catwalk fame - she had no idea who Naomi Campbell was. At school the name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that the young Lystra used to suffer panic attacks before going to class . Lystra says that being compared to the supermodel and being able to work as her lookalike has hugely boosted her confidence . The then 20-year-old, originally from Guyana, found herself in Halifax, Yorkshire - a far cry from the runways of Paris, Milan and New York - but was still stared at in the street. Lystra, who now lives in Staffordshire, joked: 'When all these people stared at me I thought there was something wrong with me! 'I had no clue until one day, about a year after I'd arrived, this woman came up to me and told me I looked like Naomi Campbell. 'I just said ""Who?!"" but when I looked it up I was flattered and started doing lookalike work. 'I signed up with the Model Bank modelling agency in Birmingham, and I have been in work ever since. 'She's been a bit less of a diva recently though - I need her to throw some more phones so the calls start coming back in!' For the last 15 years she has been turning up at functions and events in stretch limos and being 'papped' on the red carpet. She laughs when describing one event where she was surrounded by bodyguards, who took their role so seriously they even followed her into the toilet. Lystra says that despite mixed reactions from people, she loves looking like the model and feels she has now beaten her school bullies . As the supermodel - the first black model to appear on the cover of French Vogue in 1988 - has calmed down and shied away from the press, lookalike work has slowed for Lystra. However she is still stopped in the street wherever she goes - even if she is just out shopping with her partner and her daughter Jasmine, 13. Lystra said: 'Still there isn't a day goes by where I'm not told I look like her - if I had a pound for every time that happened I'd have as much money as her! 'Whenever we go on holiday I'm always stopped for autographs - it probably doesn't help that I'm wearing sunglasses which makes me look more of a diva! 'I had one woman stop me in the airport and ask for my autograph for her daughter as she was a big fan - even after I told her I wasn't Naomi. 'On the other hand, another woman shouted at me at the races the other day because she didn't believe I wasn't Naomi and said I was lying and being a bitch and a diva! 'Sometimes I just can't win, but I try not to complain - there are worse people to look like!'","Lystra grew up on Caribbean island of Montserrat .

"By . Catherine Hardy . Like Ascot, Henley Regatta comes with a strict dress code. But on the second day of the 175th regatta, rowing enthusiasts showed that there’s lots of ways to look good and appropriate on the riverside. With ladies required to wear dresses or skirts with a hemline below the knee, and strictly no trousers allowed, there were calf-length frocks by the dozen on displays as guests enjoyed the sunshine. Keeping on trend, lots of women went for printed dresses, accessorising with plain jackets and hats. Enjoying the sunshine in style: The banks of the Thames were full today as rowing enthusiasts flocked to Henley Regatta to make the most of the weather . Feeling flowery: Keeping on trend, lots of women opted for flower-printed dresses in a midi-length . Keeping things formal: Henley's strict dress code allowed women to bring out their maxi and mid dresses . With both designer and High Street shops overflowing with all things flowery, flower-printed dresses were a popular choice, in a bright array of different shades. Though hats aren’t compulsory at Henley, most women sported hats to complete the feeling of regatta chic. Unlike at Ascot or the Queen’s Garden Party there was hardly a fascinator in sight, with most ladies wearing big shady sunhats to help keep cool and avoid unsightly back-of-the-neck sunburn as they watched the rowers strut their stuff. Keeping cool: Straw sun hats with wide brims were a popular choice to avoid the ever dreaded back-of-the-neck sunburn . Anyone under there? Wide-brims were a popular choice int he hat department . Hats off to you! These women kept the flowery trend going with their flower and feather adorned hats . With stilettos likely prove somewhat unpractical when you're going for a stroll along the riverbank, most guests wore wedges or  thick-heeled shoes to save from sinking into the grass. As well as the brightly coloured prints, white was a popular choice, with on-trend lacey dresses making a big impact. Some women jumped on the blazer band-wagon to finish off their outfits, however the hot weather meant that most went for sleeveless and strapless dresses. Looking all-white: White proved to be a popular choice today at Henley. Lots of woman also joined the men in Henley's ever-present blazer trend . As well as those in the official enclosure, each year Henley also attracts a younger crowd of fans who today enjoyed sunbathing on the banks of the Thames. Flowered prints were a popular choice here too, although they’d clearly missed the memo about not flashing too much flesh. Summer lovin': Younger guests in short sundresses took advantage of Henley's premium sunbathing spots . Missed the memo: If you want to go into the official enclosure then it's strictly no shorts allowed . But while women mostly stuck to blues, greens and reds, the men of Henley came out in a full-force pink parade today, with pink trousers spanning as far as the eye could see. Pink power: Brightly coloured trousers were a popular choice for the men of Henley, ranging in shades from pastel to eye-popping hot pink . Pretty in Pink: Two young men opt for co-ordinating trousers - but at least they didn't wear matching blazers too . While the pink-trouser trend is usually only popular with upper-class school and university lads, men of all ages were getting involved, providing an eye-popping scene. Write caption here . With the weather set to stay to stay sunny for the rest of the five day regatta, there should be plenty more chance for rowing fans to top up their tans.","Today was the second day of the 175th Henley Royal Regatta on the banks of the River Thames .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A British holidaymaker died of alcohol poisoning after downing dozens of vodka and Red Bull cocktails during a three day binge in Crete, an inquest heard. Adam Walker, 22, was three-and-a-half times the legal drink drive limit when he was found dead on his hotel bed on June 6 by his friend Damien Farmer. An inquest heard the pair had spent three days in Malia on the island of Crete, drinking excessively. Adam Walker, 22, (pictured left, in black, and right) was three-and-a-half times the legal drink drive limit when he was found dead on his hotel bed in Malia, Crete, an inquest was told . Mr Farmer told police the night before Mr Walker died they had been to a 'paint party' where they had downed vodka and Red Bull and sprayed themselves with paint. An autopsy carried out the day after his death in Crete found Mr Walker had the equivalent of 280mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, compared to the legal limit of 80mg. Worcestershire Coroner Geraint William told the hearing Mr Walker had a large amount of alcohol in his bloodstream and died of acute alcohol poisoning. Recording the cause of death as abuse of alcohol, Mr Williams described the amount he had drunk as 'excessive'. He told Mr Walker's devastated parents: 'They were enjoying themselves clearly but also, without going into detail, drinking a lot of alcohol and playing drinking games. An inquest heard that Adam Walker, pictured, and his friend Damien Farmer, had spent three days in Malia on the island of Crete, drinking excessively . 'He (Mr Farmer) says on the last evening there was a paint party where they were all drinking and spraying themselves with paint. 'He described your son drinking a lot of vodka and Red Bull and going off with another friend before coming back and then going off again.' Mr Farmer - who didn't attend the hearing - told Greek police he went back to the hotel room he was sharing with his friend on June 6 and saw him on his bed, apparently asleep. He was then woken the next morning by a holiday rep knocking on the door. Coroner Mr Williams added: 'They tried to wake (Mr Walker) and realised he was dead. 'He says he picked up your son's belongings and his own and went to another hotel. Worcestershire Coroner Geraint William told the hearing Adam Walker, pictured, had a very large amount of alcohol in his bloodstream and died of acute alcohol poisoning . 'He described being very upset, as you would expect.' McDonald's worker Mr Walker, who lived with his parents in Wychbold, Worcestershire, posted a last picture on his Facebook page on June 5, the day before he died. The image shows the youngster pulling a funny face and wearing a white vest with red trim. He also posted a status on June 2 saying: 'Holiday bound get in lol' And on April 27, he wrote: 'MALIA soon can't wait lol now bed time.' His parents were too upset to comment after the inquest.","Adam Walker died of alcohol poisoning after three-day binge, inquest hears .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . A homeowner is demanding a classroom block towering over his garden be torn down after planners told him it would be 90ft away - then built it 72ft closer to his home. A typing error by planning officers in East Sussex saw the temporary classroom listed as being 90ft away from Chris Baker's Newhaven home in documents handed to the council. However, the building, put up to cope with an influx of pupils at Harbour Primary School, was then constructed just five metres, 16 ft, from his semi-detached home. Blocked: Chris Baker is demanding this classroom block which towers over his garden be pulled down after planners told him it would be 90ft away, then built it 72ft closer to his home . 'The council said the building would be 27metres away in the Word document attached to the plan I saw,' said the plumbing and heating engineer. 'We didn't have an issue with that. 'But two or three weeks ago they started building it and I questioned what was going on and they admitted they made a typing error in the documents. 'I think it was misleading. There wasn't enough information and I don't think the drawings were clear.' Father-of-three Mr Baker, 31, says the 'intrusive' building blocks light into his 42ft back garden and has slashed the value of his £220,000 home. Before: Mr Baker's garden once looked out onto the playing fields at Harbour Primary School . Work underway: Work began on the temporary classroom earlier this month, when Mr Baker realised just how close the new classrooms would be to his home . 'It blocks light and is intrusive. An estate agent came to value the place and was told I've lost two to five percent of my house value. 'The whole saga has been quite stressful and the chances of anyone wanting to buy my house are pretty slim now,' he said. 'From our dining room window we used to have a great open view out over the school playing field, instead there's a huge, great building there. 'Intrusive': Father-of-three Mr Baker, 31, says the building blocks light into his 42ft back garden and has slashed the value of his £220,000 home . 'It towers over my garden and is not nice to look at. There are four or five houses either side of me who have to face the same thing. 'In the winter when the sun is lower it's going to block light from our garden. A tree I planted down there last year will have to be taken out now.' Mr Baker, whose eldest two children go to the school, bought the house he lives in with wife Caroline, 40, seven years ago. Mr Baker added: 'I complained and wanted the council to tear the building down but they say there's nothing they can do. 'They've offered to come round and monitor the light into my garden, but it's all a bit late in my eyes. 'I think they're doing things now they should have done earlier.' Planning documents show it has been given permission to exist until September 2019 - more than five years. They read: 'The distance between the proposed mobile unit and the nearest property in The Rose Walk will be approximately 27m.' East Sussex County Council admits there had been a 'clerical error' in documents considered by the planning committee. A spokesman said: 'Due to a clerical error, the distance from the temporary classrooms to Mr Baker's house was given incorrectly on one of the documents presented to planning committee, although not in the consultation documents that were available to residents. 'While this error is regrettable, members of the planning committee were provided with site photographs and copies of the plans showing the precise location and elevations of the mobile classroom, so they were aware of the proximity of residential properties when considering the matter. 'This was recognised in some of the conditions attached to the planning permission aimed at minimising the impact on neighbouring properties, including the use of obscured glass on windows overlooking properties and a canopy covering the entrance to the classrooms. 'This application was subject to consultation with all neighbouring properties and we only received one objection to the scheme from a resident. 'Regret': East Sussex County Council says staff sympathise with Mr Baker, but the distance between his home and the building was listed correctly on photographs and plans given to the planning committee . 'This was a near but not immediate neighbour of Mr Baker. 'While we sympathise with him, we do believe this option is the best solution to accommodate an increased demand for school places in the area.' A document from the planning committee's agenda states the temporary mobile unit will hold two classrooms, toilets and a storage area. It was listed as 3.5 metres in height, 16.7 metres deep and 8 metres wide. It said: 'The distance between the proposed mobile unit and the nearest property in The Rose Walk will be approximately 27 metres.'","Planning documents said building would be 90ft from Chris Baker's home .

It is the first time the 27-year-old has come through qualifying at a grand slam and there was no shortage of drama on a packed Court 8 at Flushing Meadows during his 0-6 6-4 6-4 victory. McGee, no doubt benefiting from the close ties between New York and Ireland, was a crowd favourite from the start but lost the opening set to love in just 23 minutes. Through: Ireland's James McGee defied cramp and missed opportunities to defeat Zhang Ze . In: It is the first time the 27-year-old has come through qualifying at a grand slam and a pay day awaits . He turned things round early in the second against his Chinese opponent, though, and looked on course for victory at 5-2 in the third. But McGee's body began to give out on him and Zhang retrieved one break before holding serve to close the gap further. Serving for the biggest win of his life for a second time, the world number 195 led 40-0, only to see all three match points slip away, the final one on a double fault. There was not a spare vantage point to be had as the crowd lapped up the drama and, after missing one more match point, McGee finally clinched victory on his fifth chance. The Dublin man lay flat on his back on the court soaking up the adulation before the emotion overwhelmed him. His smile as wide as the Hudson, McGee was still signing autographs while the players for the next match on the court warmed up. The victory guarantees him a pay day worth at least £27,000, substantially the biggest of his life and a quarter of all the prize money he has earned during his career.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . James Ward fell in the final round of qualifying at the US Open for the second straight year. The British number two has been in arguably the best form of his career and arrived in New York at a career-high ranking of 131. He looked to have a golden chance to complete his set of grand slam main draw appearances against world No 205 Radu Albot, but it was the Moldovan who came through 6-1, 3-6, 6-2. Heading home: Great Britain's James Ward suffered defeat in US Open qualifying to Radu Albot . Ward made a faltering start and comprehensively dropped the first set to the consistent Albot. He fought back well in the second and they had played one game of the third when rain began to fall and kept the pair away from the court for two hours. It was an untimely break for Ward and he never got going on the resumption, throwing in a poor game to be broken for 3-1. In the stands: Great Britain Davis Cup captain Leon Smith watches Ward go out at Flushing Meadows . Albot was denied victory on his first match point by the umpire's over-rule but took his second to clinch a deserved win and a spot in the main draw of a grand slam for the first time. It has been a disappointing qualifying tournament for the British players, with the other four entrants all losing in the first round. Ward must now hope for withdrawals from the main draw that would give him a chance of getting in as a lucky loser.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . The double-dip recession is fuelling the rapid growth of cheating websites, as thousands of unhappy spouses say they are unable to afford separation. Since the UK's economic situation hit new lows this April, there has been an influx of married couples seeking extra-marital affairs via the internet. Experts believe that divorce, which costs around £13,000, is behind the shift towards wide-spread infidelity. The poor economy has  boosted cheating websites as unhappy spouses say they are unable to afford divorce . Leading married dating site IllicitEncounters.com claims that since the economy worsened they have welcomed 27,000 new members - a . 200 per cent increase on the previous year. Many stated on . their application that they were joining because they were unable to get out of . unhappy relationships due to their financial situation. Cheating consultant Rosie Freeman-Jones said: 'Many couples are now finding themselves trapped in . unhappy marriages because they simply can not afford to divorce.' And while the legal fees might pose a problem the stagnant housing market and emergence of family debt  - up 58 per cent to an average of £9,314 per household  - have also impacted. She added: 'It’s . the fact that they can’t sell their houses since the market is so . stagnant. Worse, some are in a position of negative equity. 'A surprisingly high number of people who have recently joined have said that they count their marriages as over already and would have already got a divorce by now if they could only afford it. 'Having an affair is treated almost as a practical, rather than a romantic, decision.' The pursuit of sexual excitement, boredom with marriage and the need of an ego boost were other reasons men gave for cheating, according to he UK Adultery Survey 2012 by undercoverlovers.com. Meanwhile women were more likely to be seeking emotional fulfilment, an improvement to their self esteem and lasting romance. It also found female adulterers are also far more prone to falling in love with their affair partner than their male equivalents. IllicitEncounters.com boasts around 670,000 members, more than 3 per cent of the UK's married population. Camilla, 35 from Hertfordshire, who has been a member of  IllicitEncounters.com since early May 2012, says: .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . Danniella Westbrook has fled to the States to start a three-month course of rehabilitation in a new attempt to kick her drug demons. The actress left the UK on Saturday night, before a Sunday newspaper broke the news that she was once again using cocaine. In the tell-all interview, she revealed that she had turned to the highly-addictive drug six times since the relationship with her toy boy fiance Tom Richards, 24, started to break down in April and had even ended up sleeping with her drug dealer. Scroll down for video . Speaking on This Morning, Danniella Westbrook broke down in tears while discussing the effects of her drugs relapse . Danniella initially got teary after revealing her family's attitude to her drugs relapse . Danniella apologised for crying on the TV show, claiming her children would be annoyed with her for getting teary . Today, the 40-year-old broke down in tears as she appeared on This Morning to talk to hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford about the struggles she has faced since picking up the class A drug again this year and how it has almost ruined her life once more. She said: 'I'm not where I was with drugs (at my lowest point), but it was a case of how long it would be until I was  - that's what I was really frightened about. 'I spoke to a family member a couple of weeks before it came out and said I was scared of relapsing. 'Then soon as my agent got a call saying the story is breaking, I told him I needed to get help. 'The newspapers have done me a favour - the first thing I said to the journalist was, ""thank you very much because you've done me a huge favour."" 'They helped because the thing I was most frightened of saying was that I was doing drugs, I was most fearful about how I'd cope with the backlash of everything if I came out about it. 'It has been a huge weight lifted for me. 'I've had a terrible time in the last year, which is no excuse, but I've just felt so broken and a lot of the time have been on the verge of breakdown. The actress turned to cocaine in April after relationship problems with her fiance Tom Ricards (pictured) 'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, I was weak and took drugs and I'm ashamed of that.' The mother-of-two blamed her relapse on an incredibly difficult last year that had seen the breakdown of her marriage and the loss of her family home. She had also been thrust into the limelight after revealing last year that she had been the victim of a gang rape in 1994 during the height of her initial drug use. She said: ' I knew what I was doing was wrong, I know that when I started drinking when things got heavier for me that it was inevitable that I would pick up drugs, it was just a question of when. 'The people around me could see it too. 'I thought I could be the one percent of people who would never pick up drugs again and I was wrong. 'This last year has been a big deal for me; losing my marriage was hard for me, being robbed, losing my house, moving my kids into a bedsit, it was all very hard for me. 'I thought talking about the rape would be a good thing for me and I've actually really not dealt with it very well either.' Danniella then broke down into tears as she revealed the terrible effect being back on cocaine has had on her relationship with her family. She said: 'I told my mum three weeks ago at her house but I haven't spoken to her since. 'My younger brother  - I spoke to him this morning and I know I've broken his heart. 'Drugs are always evil.' The star escaped the country on Saturday night, just a couple of hours before the news of her relapse hit the news stands. Pictured here in March before the relapse, Danniella had been clean for several years and many believed she had managed to turn her life around . She has spent the last few days reconnecting with her religion, getting therapy and attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings. She said: 'I knew when the story broke that I needed to get back to America, to be with the church. 'The first time I got clean was here in the U.S. 12 years ago. 'When I arrived in the country on Saturday night, my pastor's wife picked me up and I was in church the next morning, then back in again that evening and I'll be back there tonight. 'I'm not actually in (residential) rehab, I'm staying at a house, but I'm doing a lot of meetings here and I know a lot of people here with a lot of clean time - like 30 years. 'There are also a lot of people in meetings who have been clean and relapsed who are within recovery again, so it's a place where recovery is celebrated. Danniella's initial addiction to cocaine led to her nasal septum rotting away . 'So I'm seeing therapists, going to meetings and feeling hugely positive. 'I think where I went wrong was I didn't stay in meetings or therapy, I haven't been in meetings for six years. 'So now I think I've resorted to the knowledge that I will need it in my life day-to-day, always.' In the late 1990s, Danniella was warned that she would die in the space of two weeks if she did not quit her £400-a-day cocaine binges. Her addiction led to her being sacked from her role as Sam Mitchell on EastEnders and she suffered from several overdoses during her battle with the drug. She famously snorted such industrial amounts of cocaine that her nasal septum completely rotted away and had to have a pioneering operation which involved an implant of shark cells to repair her nose. Danniella also lost three teeth because of her habit, while others crumbled under the chemical onslaught.","Danniella, 40, says she hasn't spoken to her mum since she first broke news .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . A model who has a rare condition that makes her terrified of kissing  fears she may never find love again. Erica Valentine, 36, suffers from philemaphobia, meaning she is petrified of kissing and becoming affectionate with people. The part-time model and photographer, from Clapham, south London, constantly makes excuses not to kiss or hug because she is so frightened by the thought of passing on germs. Erica Valentine has a rare condition called philemaphobia, which means she is scared of kissing boyfriends. (Man is posed by model.) Erica has had three previous boyfriends but has found it increasingly difficult to hold a lasting relationship because of the rare phobia. She was married for eight years but eventually split after falling pregnant in 2011, when the condition was putting too much strain on the relationship. Erica said: 'I was looking on the internet about the condition and it seemed to be what I had. 'Something just happened in my mind when I started dating that I just couldn't stop. All I can think about is bacteria which must sound really weird to other people. Erica's fear of kissing means she has been unable to go on date for more than two years . 'So many things go through my head so it makes kissing impossible for me. 'My most recent boyfriend left me because he found it too difficult.' The mum-of-one gave birth to daughter Khrystal, who is now two-years-old, after splitting up with her most recent partner and has never kissed or been intimate with a man since. Erica, who was born in Brazil, moved to the UK in 1999 to work but has found it difficult to date from a young age. She said: 'I've only ever had three boyfriends and I ask them all sorts of questions such as when they last brushed their teeth or if they smoke. 'Without that I feel too scared to get close to them and it's the main reason my ex-boyfriend left me. Erica, pictured here with daughter Khrystal, two, hasn't had a boyfriend since she became a mum . 'Even though we had sex I still found it very difficult to kiss and that's why we had to break up. 'I was too scared to kiss him so I'd constantly make excuses and now I find it impossible to even think about making love - let alone do it. 'I feel weird and strange because when I see couples kissing I think about all of the viruses and bacterias they are passing on to eachother. 'Everyday things like sitting on the bus or the tube can be hard for me because I don't like being in physical contact with people.' The part-time model is so obsessed with hygiene that she asks potential dates (posed by model) a list of questions, including when they last brushed their teeth . Erica said the thought of passing on germs is so terrifying that she has to brush her teeth five or six times every day. She said: 'I can understand why someone would find it all too much because it's a lot to take in, which explains why I have been single for so long. 'I used to wear braces too so I used that as an excuse not to kiss people. The 36-year-old mum is so obsessed with germs that she struggles to get intimate with me. Her strict hygiene standards means she brushes her own teeth five or six times every day . 'I still wear a retainer but if people get close to me I just use that as a way of putting people off kissing me. 'It's really hard for me to be in big groups. which is why I don't go clubbing or anything else like that. 'Brazilian people are naturally very affectionate and like to hug and kiss people all the time but it really frightens me.'","Erica Valentine, 36, hasn't had a date in more than two years .

'On the final fitting the zip just wouldn't do up, I had to have it taken out an inch either side, so two inches in total. 'The dress was a size 20, which annoyed me anyway - I did not believe that I was that size at all. 'When they had to let the dress out it was absolutely horrifying. I was mortified.

I've got my life back' Vicky piled on the weight eating up to five take-aways a week and drank up to five cans of cola a day. She said: 'I was never really big as a child or anything. The weight piled on as I was with my now-husband. 'We just felt so comfortable that neither of us really thought about what we were eating - we didn't really care. 'The problem was that we didn't really cook at home. It just got to the point where we would rely on frozen meals and take-aways. 'We'd probably have five take-aways a week. My favourite were doner kebabs. I'd have one a week. 'I also lived on full-fat coke. I'd have four or five cans of it a day. I just didn't realise how bad for you it was.' Changing figure: After looking at her wedding pictures she decided enough was enough and joined her local Slimming World, where she learned how to cook healthy, fat-free meals.

She now cooks with her husband and two children creating family favourites, such as pizza, but in a healthy way. She added: 'My life has changed dramatically, I think even just doing the everyday things. I didn't realise how restricted my life had been beforehand. 'I used to hate going to the beach because I would always wear long sleeved T-shirts. Now I can go to the beach with the kids and we can all have a fantastic time. 'I also used to refuse to walk anywhere, I would get my husband to drop me off at the entrance to places before he'd go and park the car. I didn't even realise I was doing it. But now I walk everywhere and the kids join in with me - it's great. 'My confidence has just rocketed since I lost the weight - it's unbelievable. I've got my life back.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former beauty queen who had a quarter of her skull removed and then . stored in her stomach for six weeks after a near-fatal fishing accident has revealed her shock as she woke to find her a portion of her head missing. Surgeons . removed the rear quarter of Jamie Hilton's skull and placed it in her . abdomen, which enabled the bone to remain sterile and nourished while brain . swelling from a head injury subsided. Mrs Hilton, 36, who won Mrs. Idaho in 2009 and competed in the Mrs. America beauty contests, told the Today show: 'I remember lifting the gown, looking down and seeing this bulge in stomach, and thinking, ""Is this real?""' Tales of survival: Jamie Hilton, a former beauty queen who had a quarter of her skull removed, and stored in her stomach for six weeks has spoken of her remarkable recovery and the moment she woke from the ordeal . 'When I woke up, I was surrounded by family. I could feel the joy when I opened my eyes, so the feeling in the room was good before they showed me my skull,' the mother-of-three added. 'I'm just so grateful the moment my feet . touch the ground. The mundane isn't so mundane any more - I get make . breakfast and take my kids to school. I'm so happy.' Mrs Hilton's skull remained in her abdomen for 42 days until it was re-attached in a successful operation and now, three months after her near death experience she has returned home, and is considered a 'walking miracle.' The former beauty queen's brush with death came after . she joined her husband Nick and brother-in-law Greg on a salmon fishing . trip to Hell's Canyon in Idaho in June. As she tried to reel in her first fish she lost her footing and fell 12ft on to a boulder. Her husband scrambled down to his wife and found her unconscious, without a pulse and not breathing. Emotional: The mother-of-three woke surrounded by her family, she said, 'I could feel the joy when I opened my eyes, so the feeling in the room was good before they showed me my skull' Walking miracle: Mrs Hilton's skull remained in her abdomen for 42 days until it was re-attached in a successful operation and now, three months after her near death experience she has returned home . Mom's musketeers: The mother-of-three said, 'I'm just so grateful the moment my feet touch the ground. I get to take my kids to school. I'm so happy' When he lifted her, Mrs Hilton began breathing again and nearby Forest Ranger called for emergency services, where she was airlifted to Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, with severe brain swelling. Mr Hilton said: 'I just knew it was . going to bad, I wasn't sure if I was screaming her name out loud or in . my head, but I knew I had to get her out of there as quickly as I . could.' Mrs Hilton's family was warned that the next 72 . hours would decide if she lived or died, and they took the decision to . remove a quarter of her skull until the brain swelling went down. The skull portion remained in her abdomen for 42 days until it was removed and sutured back onto its original place. Dr . Ted Schwartz, a professor of neurology at New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center explained the procedure, which allows a swollen . brain to expand beyond the confines of the skull bone. Accident: Mrs Hilton, who was Mrs Idaho 2009, slipped during a fishing trip and hit her head on a boulder. As he brain swelled, doctors took out part of her skull (right) for more than a month to allow the brain to expand . Safe: The skull was put in her stomach to keep the bone nourished for after the brain swelling went down . In hospital: After 42 days, the piece of skull was then put back into Jamie's head in a successful operation . 'It's called a hemicraniectomy, which is carried out relatively routinely in order to relieve swelling. 'The skull is a closed cavity, so when that swelling occurs, the pressure goes up in the head and that can be very dangerous. And one of the best options is actually to implant the skull into the abdomean. He added: 'It's not only sterile but it travels with you. For example Bob Woodruff, the news reporter, had a hemicraniectomy . in Afghanistan. he was able to travel with the bone in his belly and . they were able to put it back onto his head in the United States.' As Mrs Hilton came round from the operation she called the doctor over to her and said: 'Thank you for what you have done. You have saved my life!' On her blog site where her recovery was detailed Mrs Hilton, from Boise, Idaho, revealed: 'NOTHING in this world really matters to me today other than I AM HERE. I am on this GLORIOUS earth with my unbelievable family.' On the mend: Hilton, 36, has been blogging about her progress and has returned to work . Support: Mrs Hilton, who was Mrs Idaho in 2009, has three children with her husband Nick, pictured . 'I can snuggle my kids, kiss my husband, . hang out with my mom, and LIVE. My heart feels like it could explode . with GRATITUDE. My cup is running over with joy and happiness. Is . everything in my life perfect? No. But today I AM ALIVE!' 'Surgery went as well as expected! My skull is back in my head... really weird to say ;),' she said. 'Stitches this time, not staples! They are scheduled to come out August 3rd. yeah! So for now the only possible problems, are infection, or my body rejecting the skull being back in my head. 'Your prayers are FELT and APPRECIATED! Never in my life have I FELT the prayers and faith of others in my behalf. What a marvelous experience. THANK YOU!' Jamie posted a photo of the skull in her abdomen on her blog page entitled 'Miracles believe in them' as well as a photo showing a scar running the length of her head. Since recovering she has returned to work in the family taxi business as she attempts to clear a six figure medical bill for her life saving surgery.","Jamie Hilton, 36, slipped and hit her head on a rock during a fishing trip .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap  Reporter . Bad 'news': Writers of the 223-year-old folk manual have used their 'secret' formula to predict another terrible winter in the East and more drought strife out West . The Old Farmer's Almanac, the 223-year-old chronicler of climate, folksy advice and fun facts, is predicting a colder winter and warmer summer for much of the nation. Published Wednesday, the New Hampshire-based almanac predicts a 'super-cold' winter in the eastern two-thirds of the country. The west will remain a little bit warmer than normal. Publishers claim their forecasts--based on a 'secret' formula that looks at weather and astronomical trends--have an 80 percent accuracy rate. 'Colder is just almost too familiar a term,' Editor Janice Stillman said. 'Think of it as a refriger-nation.' More bad news for those who can't stand snow: Most of the Northeast is expected to get more snowfall than normal, though it will be below normal in New England. Before unpacking the parka, however, remember that 'colder than average' is still only about 2 to 5 degrees difference. For loyal readers of an almanac that also tracks to the minute every sunrise and sunset for the year, the timing of this year's publication may come as a surprise. Normally, it hits the stands in mid-September. In recent years, its younger cousin, the Maine-based Farmer's Almanac, has published in August and a competition of sorts has emerged, though Stillman said it had nothing to do with the earlier drop date. 'We've found that folks want the almanac as soon as the issue is done up, right as the growing season is done,' she said. 'It's also time to order oil, wood, salt for roads. We've had so many inquiries we just decided to get it into people's hands earlier.' The almanac also provides advice on planting, astronomy, food, love and the best time to cut your hair. More bad news for those who can't stand snow: Most of the Northeast is expected to get more snowfall than normal, though it will be below normal in New England . Some other regional highlights: . Florida's winter could be rainier than most years while other locales in the Southeast and central states will see less rain. Summer will be warmer than usual in most places while a drop in rainfall in the country's midsection could hurt crop yields. Despite some winter downpours in the west, the almanac says California's drought will likely continue. Hurricane season isn't expected to be especially active though a major storm could hit the Gulf Coast in late August. The Old Farmer's Almanac boasts 3.5 millions printing per year in the U.S. and Canada. The manual claims to base its secret prediction formula on sunspots, astronomy and the moon. While moon phases have been all but phased out of its formula, a spokesman told Fox recently that the Old Farmer's Almanac has started to phase in some new analytics based on modern technology. The almanac, which claims about an 80 percent accuracy rate in its forecasts, employs modern technology but still uses the 'secret formula' that founder Robert Thomas devised in 1792. By combining the study of sunspots, prevailing weather patterns and basic meteorology, the almanac's weather staff comes up with a long-range forecast. The temperature deviations are based on 30-year averages compiled by government forecasters. Continued strife: Despite some winter downpours in the west, the almanac says California's drought will likely continue .","Newest edition of the 223-year-old folk manual was published Wednesday .

"By . Bianca London . It all began in 1994 with Eva Herzigova's famous . ‘Hello Boys’ advertising campaign. But Wonderbra has come a long way since the Nineties - and technology has advanced just as dramatically. To mark its success in this multimedia world, the luxury lingerie brand today launches its first app. Called the Wonderbra Decoder App, the downloadable app allows users to undress stunning 21-year-old model Adriana Cernanova - the latest face of the brand - to reveal her racy underwear. Now you see it... now you don't! The new app allows users to 'undress' Adriana . The 21-year-old Danish model looks stunning in the new ad campaign, which allows you to reveal her underwear secrets . Users who have downloaded the app simply find the images in magazines or online, then hold their smartphone with the app open over the code found on the image. The model's clothes will instantly disappear - leaving her in the underwear (and, cleverly, details on where to buy it). The Wonderbra Decoder app is part of the brand's new marketing campaign that hopes to provide users with a more interactive experience. App users can scan multiple dressed images of . Adriana to reveal the different Wonderbra behind her look and view a . gallery of recommended Wonderbras for different outfits, from daywear to . special occasions. Although the ad campaign itself is clothed, scanning the image allows you to reveal much more . The 21-year-old model looks confident as she poses in a figure hugging dress for the new campaign . The campaign will run throughout October and November and is timed for the run up to the Christmas party season. Martina Alexander, Marketing Manager for Wonderbra UK said: 'Wonderbra offers a bra for all occasions and we want to highlight this in a fun and original way. 'Our new App for fashion-conscious girls, reveals the recommended Wonderbra for different looks to help her enhance any outfit.' The Wonderbra Decoder App is available now free from the App Store and Google Play and after downloading you can undress Adriana yourself by holding your phone to the screen. Most girls would feel a little . apprehensive about following the likes of Herzigova and Dita Von Teese . into the world of Wonderbra modelling. But Adriana isn't like most girls. Since she joined the brand in 2011, it is clear to see that the stunning Slovakian is understandably big on confidence and has taken to her new role as Wonderbra Woman with style. It is easy to see why the . 5ft 11in model was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls following a worldwide . casting. Adriana's perfect body is complemented by a big smile, twinkling blue eyes and long blonde hair. 'It is important to always have nice . underwear and Wonderbra is special in that way because it makes you feel . even sexier,' she said when she joined the label. A spokeswoman said: 'She is fun, naturally sexy and smart — and exudes a confidence that really sets her apart.'","App allows users to scan clothed photo of model and reveal lingerie beneath .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Starting with the DynaTAC in 1974 and ending with Apple’s iPhone 5S, a team of designers has plotted the major milestones in the 40-year history of the mobile phone. The first cellular voice calls were made in 1973 and it took ten years for the first handheld phone, called the DynaTAC 8000x, to go on sale. Since then the number of phones has risen to more than 6 billion and this video shows how market leaders of the 1980s and 90s, such as Nokia and Motorola, have made way for the likes of Apple and Samsung. Scroll down for video . Starting with the DynaTAC in 1974, to the Nokia 7110 of the mid-1990s, and ending with Apple's iPhone 5S, a team of designers from New York has plotted the major milestones in the 40-year history of the mobile phone. The Nokia 7110 was the first mobile phone to run Series 40 and to come with a WAP browser . The iPhone was released on 29 June 2007 in the U.S before being made available in the UK and Europe in November. It is attributed as revolutionising the smartphone industry and fuelled the rise in handsets around the world. The original iPhone operating system 3.1.3 was the last version of iPhone OS (now iOS) to be released for the original model. It comes in 4GB, 8GB and 16GB versions and prices started at $499 (£309). The original iPhone has a 3.5-inch, 160-pixel per inch screen. The phone includes, contacts, calendar, visual voice mail, SMS and quad-band GSM + Edge, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Jobs announced at the launch the software also lets people have multiple SMS messaging sessions at once. The video was created by London-based design and development firm Fueled. Its soundtrack features a Motorola advert from the 1980s which predicted the rise of the mobile. The voiceover says: 'Industry watchers say there are only a few thousand of cellular phones in use right now, but that number is expected to grow considerably within the next few years – during the cellular revolution.’ Fueled’s video begins with the DynaTAC ‘brick’ phone developed by Dr Martin Cooper. Cooper made the first phone call over a cellular network in 1973, but it took a decade until his DynaTAC 8000x was sold as the first commercial handheld phone in 1983. It weighed 1.75lb, stood 13-inch high, stored 30 numbers, took 10 hours to recharge and cost $3,995 (£2,390). The 'brick' was followed by the pioneering Motorola MicroTAC 9800X which had one of the world's first 'flip' designs.

The world's first GSM, or digital, phone was launched in 1991 by a British firm called Orbitel. The Orbitel TPU 900 weighed more than 4lbs, and its sister model, the TPU 901, was the first phone to receive a text message in 1992. During the mid-1990s Nokia released its 7110 model, while German phone manufacturer Hagenuk released its MT-200. The Nokia 7110 was the first mobile phone to run Series 40 and to come with a WAP browser. It went on sale in October 1999. Canadian firm BlackBerry released its first phone, the 6210, pictured, in 2003. It was the 10th BlackBerry handset, but was the first with an integrated phone. The 5810 had phone functions, but users needed an additional headset to use them .

Mark David Chapman, who is serving a 20 year-to-life sentence,  was interviewed by state parole officials this week and a decision on his release is expected as early as next week. Chapman, who shot the Beatle on December 8, 1980, has had a clean prison record since 1994 but is not expected to be released. Scroll down for video . Mark Chapman is awaiting a decision on his parole which is being fought by John Lennon's widow Yoko Ono . Lennon was shot dead by Chapman while he walked home with Ms Ono, also pictured, on December 8, 1980 . If unsuccessful, the 59-year-old will have to wait another two years before he is again eligible for parole. Ms Ono opposed Chapman's release, according to the New York Daily News, arguing that it would endanger her and Lennon's two sons. She also said Chapman was at risk of retribution attacks from fans. Chapman has previously said he targeted the singer because of his fame and because he thought he was a phoney for living a life of luxury. He killed Lennon, 40, as the singer and Ms Ono returned home after a recording session. Chapman is reportedly kept in protective custody and is only allowed out of his cell for three hours a day. He has conjugal visits with his wife, Gloria Chapman, who he married before committing the murder.","A decision on Mark Chapman's release from prison is expected next week .

"By . Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . In the lottery of life it turns out men don't fare as well as women, with the death rate for Australian males 50 percent higher than it is for females, new data shows. The latest figures on morality show women often outlive men, with the male death rate 1.5 times higher than that of females. If men had the same death rate as women, there would have been 71,400 fewer male deaths over the 2009-11 period, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data. The latest figures on morality show women often outlive men, with the male death rate 50 percent higher than that of females . But the inequality spreads much wider than just gender, with being Indigenous or living in very remote areas also significant factors influencing death rates. The death rate among Indigenous Australians was higher than that of non-Indigenous Australians in all age groups, but it was five times higher for those people aged between 35-44. People living in remote areas had death rates 1.4 times as high as those of city dwellers, and higher rates of death due to diabetes and land transport accidents. 'For people living in areas of lowest socioeconomic status, the death rate was 1.3 times as high as for those living in areas of the highest socioeconomic status, with death rates from diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease notably higher, at 1.8 times as high and 1.7 times as high, respectively,' Louise York, spokeswoman for the Institute, said. If men had the same death rate as women, there would have been 71,400 fewer male deaths over the 2009-11 period, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data . Overseas-born Australian residents had lower death rates than those who were born in Australia. Asian-born Australian residents had a death rate that was 36 percent lower than the rate for Australian-born residents, while women born in Europe had a 24 percent lower rate than Australian-born women. 'Many of these patterns for 2009-11 were similar to patterns from 10 years earlier, showing that mortality inequalities are long-standing in Australia,' Ms York said. 'We also found that the Australians who had the worst death rates tended to experience deaths from causes that, in many cases, can be considered to be preventable or treatable. These are often referred to as potentially avoidable deaths.'","Latest figures show male death rate is 1.5 times higher than females .

The majority of past and present Cronulla NRL players implicated in the ASADA scandal, including captain Paul Gallen, have elected to accept a deal that will see them miss just three matches. It has been reported the bulk of the 17 players and ASADA have agreed to back-dated 12-month suspensions on Friday morning. The Sharks players had been given until 9.30am on Friday to accept the deal. Scroll down for video . Sharks captain Paul Gallen is one of the majority of past and present Cronulla NRL players implicated in the ASADA scandal who have elected to accept the deal that will see them miss just three matches . Cronulla Sharks player Wade Graham left his lawyer's office on Wednesday after reportedly being issued with a show-cause notice from the anti-doping authority . The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, according to News Corp Australia. The notices, which follow ASADA's anti-doping investigation into the Cronulla Sharks' 2011 supplements program, were distributed to the lawyers of players on Wednesday and signaled the authority's intent to charge players. Due to the suspensions being back-dated as far back as November 2013, News Corp Australia reported that players would only miss this season's last three games and a few weeks of next year’s training before the 2015 season begins. The Sharks skipper, Paul Gallen, was one of 17 players involved in the club's 2011 supplements program to be reportedly offered the suspensions. Cronulla Sharks player Anthony Tupou refused to comment as he left his lawyer in Sydney. He was one of the 17 past and present players to be given doping notices over the club's 2011 supplements program . On Wednesday, Gallen said if he or any other Cronulla player accepted the reduced bans deal offered by ASADA, they would automatically be labelled drug cheats and be admitting to have taken  banned peptides. The admission could see notices also issued to the Shark's coaching staff for including the peptides in the team's supplement regime . 'Obviously there are a lot of rumours going around the past couple of days - the boys have spoken about it,' Gallen told Sky Sports Radio's Big Sports Breakfast. 'Our mind and our mood changes every 10 minutes. At one stage we're (thinking) ""thank God, this is going to be over hopefully, whatever happens is going to happen and we can just get on with life"".

"By . Leon Watson . A drug-taking wedding venue manager stole deposits put down by engaged couples to pay off his debts, a court heard. Paul Hayes, 32, took cash to cover rent and drug deals because he claimed his £17,500 salary did not cover his living expenses. The former pupil at the fee-paying Argyle House School was assistant general manager at the Grade II Quayside Exchange in Sunderland but had started using ecstasy and cocaine. Paul Hayes, 32, a wedding venue manager who stole couples' deposits to pay off drug dealers. He is pictured here leaning out of a window at his home in Sunderland . Hayes was caught when general manager Andrew Gevorkian counted out cash to pay a supplier in front of staff before placing it in an envelope in the safe on May 24. When the money vanished Mr Gevorkian checked CCTV to find Hayes had disconnected the alarm system and the camera overlooking the safe before helping himself. Hayes admitted stealing around £1,000 at Sunderland Magistrates' Court which heard he already has eight previous convictions for theft. Prosecutor Lee Poppett said Hayes had been on annual leave at the time and had no reason to be in the premises. Mr Poppett said. 'He accepted he went to the Quayside Exchange because he owed someone money. 'He turned off the CCTV. It was his intention to pay the money back, but unfortunately he did not.' Further suspicions were raised when couples started contacting the venue who had booked weddings and functions. The Grade II listed Quayside Exchange in Sunderland where Paul Hayes stole money from the safe after disconnecting the alarm system when he was assistant manager . A couple said they had paid £400 to Hayes on March 20, another had paid £295 on March 1 and a woman had paid £200 on March 21. In total Hayes had taken £935 and admitted a sample count of theft from employer. In mitigation, Chris Wilson said: 'Unfortunately, he committed a number of offences to discharge a debt to a drug dealer who put him under significant pressure, and, possibly duress. 'He was employed for seven years in a number of capacities. He had an opportunity for life to work for that organisation. 'He had the potential to become a director. Through his own stupidity, he appears before this court.' Mr Wilson added: 'He has an awareness that it was wrong. It was his whole intention he was going to make full repayment to the organisation. 'Put very simply, he was using the money of the organisation almost like a payday loan company.' Sentencing Hayes to 18 weeks’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with 100 hours of unpaid work, chairman Bob Francis said: 'You accepted money from customers and did not record it, therefore you caused the customers distress and the company you worked for will be getting a bad name. 'You have eight previous convictions for theft and we have read that you have not complied with court orders in the past. 'If you do not co-operate, you will walk straight to Durham. You are jolly lucky you aren’t going off there today.' Hayes was also told to pay £935 compensation, £85 costs and £80 victim surcharge. Approached him at his home, Hayes denied having been to court and said he knew nothing about the case.","Paul Hayes, 32, stole nearly £1,000 from Sunderland's Quayside Exchange .

"By . Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . A former prison guard has pleaded guilty to a dozen of charges after her involvement in a crime ring operating outside of a Darwin prison. Sarah Dawn Rudd held her six-month-old son when she faced the Northern Territory Supreme Court on Wednesday, according to NT News. The 26-year-old pleaded guilty to several drug charges, as well as convincing a colleague to illegally access confidential information on other prisoners on the Corrections database. Sarah Dawn Rudd pleaded guilty to several drug charges and convinced a colleague to illegally access information on other prisoners on the Corrections database . Her partner and co-offender, Anthony Butt, who is a firefighter, supported her in court. The couple were both charged in May last year for possessing steroids from a trip to Thailand. Her barrister Jon Tippett QC said his client had a hard time working as a guard and began using drugs – before she was arrested with ecstasy pills and 1.5g of the drug ice in her undies during a drug deal at Le Cornu, Winnellie. The court heard how Ms Rudd told a woman name Zayley Ainslie how to smuggle cannabis past patrolling dogs for her prison boyfriend Phillip Noel Kaye, who was also Ms Rudd's alledged drug dealer. Ms Rudd had been working at the Darwin Correctional Centre for four years when she was arrested in a police sting, Operation Moonraker, in June last year. Justice Jenny Blokland said the harm was in compromising the integrity of Corrections, according to NT News. It is believed that Ms Rudd had committed 12 crimes between March and June 2013. Crown prosecutor David Morters told the court she used fellow guard Dwayne Reichelt to access confidential information to find out if her alleged drug dealer Mr Kaye who was already arrested when she tried contacting him. She also passed messages from prisoner Jared Davis, a Rebels bikie, to James Hau, who was arrested with 14 guns that former navy sailor Matthew Evans stole from a patrol boat at Larrakeyah, telling him that Davis wanted him to organise cannabis supply to the prison through Kaye, according to NT News. She also told Hau what evidence Mr Davis wanted him to give about the firearms. Prosecutor Morters said Mr Hau had planned to trade the guns to the Rebels in exchange for “dangerous drugs”. 'These offences constitute a serious undermining of the criminal justice system,' prosecutor Morters said. 'It's a significant breach of trust to be participating in the supply of drugs into a correctional facility.' Barrister Tippett said Justice Jenny Blokland should be lenient in sentencing her because none of the charges resulted in any serious harm. 'She had been a prison officer who had (always) stuck to her ethical and professional responsibilities in the past and along came a period of significant uncertainty (and) emotional upheaval,' he said. The sentencing case continues.","Sarah Dawn Rudd pleaded guilty to several drug charges and convincing a colleague to illegally access confidential information on other prisoners .

"By . Julian Robinson . This is the terrifying moment a young mother walks her two children across a busy railway line - in an apparent bid to take a short cut. The woman pushes one child in a pram alongside the tracks while a toddler follows behind her - just inches away from where trains pass at a busy junction in Pitsea, Essex. The British Transport Police, who are looking for the woman, has released CCTV images of the family in a bid to alert people to the dangers of trespassing on the railways. Scroll down for videos . Dangerous: The young woman is seen pushing her pram across a busy railway in Pitsea, Essex . A spokesperson from the BTP said: 'We don’t know what this woman was doing, but the only reason we can think that she would take two small children across a railway is because she was following a short cut. 'People don’t realise that walking along a train track is just as dangerous as walking down the middle of a motorway.' The incident came after police warned as many as 14 children and young adults a day are risking their lives and those of rail passengers by trespassing on railways. Alarming: A child is seen following his mother alongside busy tracks after she opted to take a short cut over the lines . BTP has launched Operation Intruder in an attempt to drive the alarming figures down amid a series of incidents this month alone.

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . and John Greechan . The Scot leading the global fight against doping has warned Glasgow 2014 competitors to beware the danger of supplements — as testers adopt a ‘no excuses’ policy. Sir Craig Reedie, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, remains frustrated by athletes continuing to put their faith in unregulated nutritional shakes and mixes. A dodgy supplement is often cited when a positive test is produced, with Team Scotland cyclist Bruce Croall recently serving a six-month ban – despite authorities ruling that he hadn’t deliberately tried to cheat – as a result of a contaminated product. Watch out: Sir Craig Reedie has warned athletes against taking unapproved supplements . Former British Olympic Association chairman Reedie told Sportsmail: ‘I can understand why athletes take these things, because they will do anything to get an edge and improve their performance. But it is extremely dangerous. ‘I mean, there is a clearly an issue at the moment with supplements. The supplements business the world over is almost entirely unregulated. ‘It’s important to get control of what people put in these things, because athletes will keep taking supplements. Very experienced athletes take them – and, in many ways, they shouldn’t. If they must take them, they have to make sure that what they’re taking is absolutely clear. ‘There was a case of a German athlete in Sochi, someone who had been to two Olympic Games, should know exactly what she was doing. But one of her friends said: “Oh, you should take this supplement.” So she did. ‘I mean, it’s that kind of occasional weakness that can cause a real problem. If they are determined to take supplements, they should know that they’re clean. Croall blow: Cyclist Bruce Croall was banned for six months despite his offence being ruled an accident . ‘The new world-wide code coming into place next year will deal rather more accurately with what you would describe as minor offences. But basically the principle of strict liability still applies.’ UK Anti-Doping will run the testing programme in Glasgow and, during the run-in to the Games, they’re delivering a mandatory education programme to all Home Nations teams. Nicola Newman, UKAD’s director of communications and education, told Sportsmail: ‘Our two aims are never to get a positive test at a major event from a British athlete and to stop a serious doper from competing. That’s our goal, although we can’t guarantee it. ‘”No excuses” is another phrase for us. We don’t want anybody to feel they lacked the knowledge they needed. We’re working really hard with federations and sports to make sure they all understand the risks. ‘The on-going message that we’re giving to these athletes is predominantly around not making a mistake or getting a positive test because they didn’t understand.’ Every athlete selected to compete at the Games, as well as more than 200 coaches, must sign up to UKAD’s education programme, the largest the organisation has ever run, to try to ensure they do not make an innocent mistake by taking an illegal supplement or medication. One month to go: With the games approaching the Queen's Baton has been touring the country . Competitors have been told there are ‘no guarantees at all’ if they buy products online and have been advised to check every supplement with the Informed-Sport programme, which batch-tests products for banned substances. UKAD have even run mock urine-testing sessions for athletes less familiar with the rigours of drug-testing, such as members of the lawn bowls teams, to ensure British athletes are given as much information as possible ahead of the Games. Newman said: ‘We worked with some of these sports in Delhi (the last Commonwealth Games, in 2010). Some of them were incredibly nervous about the implications of providing a sample so we ran mock testing with them. We showed them exactly what happens. It’s not necessarily normal but it’s definitely necessary. ‘A lot of athletes going (to Glasgow) won’t have been to a major event before or have needed to fully understand all of the rules around medication and supplements, in and out of competition. ‘But this is non-negotiable. It’s mandatory for all athletes, as well as sports personnel who all have to do an online course, and it’s the first time it’s happened in the UK.’","Commonwealth Games start in Glasgow next month .

"By . Tim Finan For The Daily Mail . Calais Mayor Madame Natacha Bouchart has proposed a 'Sangatte 2' hostel in the town for 400 migrants . A children’s summer camp set in idyllic surroundings on the outskirts of Calais could soon become home to hundreds of destitute UK bound migrants. The town’s mayor, Madame Natacha Bouchart, has proposed a ‘Sangatte 2’ hostel for 400 migrants to appease the local population of the port where currently 1300 Asians and Africans are squatting in sordid camps and disused buildings. Sources say the Jules Ferry leisure camp set in open countryside next to a beach and sand dunes looking over to the white cliffs of Dover is the most likely of four potential locations favoured by local politicians. The camp’s buildings are capable of housing several hundred people and are fully equipped with sanitary, shower and cooking facilities. It is located about three miles from the town centre and the ferry terminal. Both Madame Bouchart and president of a charity organisation which feeds migrants, Jean Claude Lenoir, are both said to favour the summer camp. But the Jules Ferry camp’s proximity to the port’s ferry terminal and trucker’s depots is likely to enrage lorry drivers who regularly clash with migrants attempting to break into their trailers and stow away to the UK on ferries to Dover. If the camp is turned into ‘Sangatte 2’ migrants would be able to take shortcuts through the sand dunes passing Second World War German bunkers and reach the truckers’ depots within half an hour on foot. Meanwhile, the former director of the original Sangatte hostel run by the Red Cross has warned that the creation of new state-run hostel would escalate the number of migrants coming to Calais, causing more chaos. In an interview with newspaper Voix du Nord Michel Derr, said when Sangatte was created in October 1999 the number of people arriving tripled in just three months. Calais currently has 1300 Asian and African squatters who are living in sordid camps and disused building . The porposed site for the camp overlooks the white cliffs of Dover, and is a short walk to the local port and truckers depots . The majority of Calais migrants are camping at what has been dubbed ‘Jungle 2’, a vast open air squat with no running water or toilets situated on land owned by a chemical factory. Hundreds more migrants are being housed and fed in huts provided by local village councils and charity groups at Teteghem and Grande Synthe near Dunkirk as well as Norrent Fontes on the motorway south of Calais. In early August the factory obtained a court order for the eviction of the migrants at ‘Jungle 2’ but Calais prefect Denis Robin announced he would only bulldoze the camp after migrants had been informed of their asylum rights in France.","The Jules Ferry leisure camp overlooking Dover is the most likely location .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A woman who suffers from RSI claims she's cured her pain by becoming a mermaid. Frankie Dubery, 25, has regained the use of her legs both on land and under the sea after donning a tail and taking to the water. Cambridge-graduate Frankie suffered severe repetitive strain injury after spending up to 80 hours a week at a desk. Scroll down for video . Frankie Dubery was confined to a wheelchair after suffering from a chronic case of repetitive strain injury . Her mermaid trick has enabled her to battle the debilitating illness where she is now able to walk . As part of her act, Frankie is able to dive to depths of 20 metres and hold her breath for three minutes . Housebound and miserable Frankie decided to start a company called Merlesque friends Demelza Fox and Mairead Kelly after becoming interested in mermaids. Now she can hold her breath for nearly three minutes and dive to depths of 20 metres in order to entertain the crowds of thousands the act regularly attracts. Frankie, from Orpington, Kent, said: 'Being a mermaid is like nothing else - I love it. 'My RSI left me in agony. I would be in pain before I even got out of bed in the morning. I was confined to a wheel chair and could barely leave the house. 'Starting Merlesque has given me my freedom back. RSI is recurring, but I know now that I continue being a mermaid if it does return.' After spending more than 80 hours a week at a desk, Frankie suffered serious pain in her arms and legs . Frankie launched her own business Wildfire Productions with three friends after graduating from Cambridge . Frankie studied Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Cambridge University and graduated in 2010. During her studies she got into performance art including fire poi and trapeze. On graduating Frankie decided she wanted to be an entertainer full time but no circuses in Cambridge were recruiting full time staff. She said: 'It was a difficult economic time and there weren't many jobs available in the industry I wanted so I decided to start my own business, Wildfire Productions. 'I had an office job to support myself financially and was working on the company in my free time, so I was spending eighty hours a week at a desk. Now Frankie, pictured, has regained use of her legs due to her strenuous fitness regime . 'My wrists and fingers seized up with repetitive strain injury - I was in agony. At the same time, an old injury in my legs got worse until I couldn't walk anymore. 'I couldn't leave the house, let alone carry on with the performance that I loved. Demelza had already researched mermaids and she suggested we give it a go.' It took over a year for the three women to get their business up and running, and Merlesque Mermaids officially launched last year. Now Frankie has regained the use of her legs thanks to the exercise being a mermaid provides. She said: 'The RSI is a recurring injury, so it could come back at any time, but I know that I will always have mermaiding if it does come back. 'It's quickly become my favourite type of performance. It took a lot of research and training but I wouldn't change it for the world. 'I have even been to Thailand to certify as an advanced free-diver to improve my skills. Now I can dive to 20 metres and hold my breath for two minutes 50 seconds.' The trio now take booking for events across the country, including weddings, birthdays and corporate events, where they swim, sing and perform for the guests.","Frankie Dubery suffered the debilitating illness after sitting at her desk .

Mark Hemmington of the NFWS said he had intended releasing Pudding into the wild but she bonded with him . After appearing on the society's Facebook page, Pudding's legend has even managed to cross the Atlantic ocean. Speaking to ABC News, Mark Hemmington of the NFWS said: 'Pudding came to us from Yorkshire, hence the name Pudding. She was found on her own at a very young age.' Mr Hemmington said the original plan was to try and release pudding into the wild by integrating her with a litter of cubs and get her accustomed to foraging for food. But instead, the fox prefers human companionship and all efforts to convince her to move out failed. A large tree fell, which prevented Pudding meeting the other fox cubs at a vital time in her development. Pudding has even appeared on television in the United States and has a growing legion of fans on Facebook . Despite his success in taming Pudding, Mr Hemmington said the best place for foxes is the wild . He added: 'Pudding had no cubs to integrate with and bonded more with me.' However Mr Hemmington does not advise other people to try and tame a fox as 'they are wild animals and that is where I believe they should be'. The NFWS is a voluntary organisation which has been rescuing injured and sick foxes for more than 20 years.

Kate Bush (left) performing in 1979, the year she last played a gig and (right) today. She will play her first live gig for 35 years when she begins a 22-night residency at London's Hammersmith Apollo next week . At that time, mobile phone technology and home computing were only in their infancy. And she has urged her fans to refrain from using mobile phones and tablets to record, or take pictures, of the upcoming tour. Writing on her website, she said: 'I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium. 'It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows. I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras. 'I know it's a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together.' The Wuthering Heights singer has asked fans not to film, or take pictures, of her upcoming gig . Kate Bush last performed at the Hammersmith Odeon in May 1979 and will play at the same venue on Tuesday . The Wuthering Heights singer is not the first musician to criticise gig-goers who spend their time  using their mobile devices rather than  watching the show. Roger Daltrey, The Who frontman, recently said it was 'weird' that people seemed to spend more time on their phones than watching a show. He said: 'I feel sorry for them, I really feel sorry for them. Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you're doing that, you're 50 per cent there, right? It's weird. I find it weird.' Performance artist Marina Abramovic also recently barred visitors to her exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London from bringing in their devices, so they could focus more on the art she was creating. Bush's live comeback tour sold out in less than 15 minutes when tickets were released in March this year. She soared to fame in 1979 with her single Wuthering Heights, which she wrote when she was just 18. Shy of publicity, Bush has become respected for her uncompromising individualism and her comeback tour sold out in less than 15 minutes . The song based on Emily Brontë's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including Babooshka and Running Up That Hill. Shy of publicity, she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style. She was just 20 when she completed The Tour Of Life with three dates at what was then called the Hammersmith Odeon, after topping the charts with Wuthering Heights the previous year, becoming the first woman to go to number one singing one of her own songs. Over the years, theories about her absence from the stage have included her perfectionism, a fear of flying and the death of one of the tour crew, lighting director Bill Duffield, during a show. But in a rare interview with Mojo magazine in 2011 to mark a comeback from one of her lengthy recording silences, she explained that her years of absence from the touring circuit were simply down to the sheer exertion of a show. She said: 'It was enormously enjoyable. But physically it was absolutely exhausting.'","Pop icon Kate Bush has urged fans not to film or take pictures of her gigs .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . The price of fuel at the pumps has fallen to a three-year low, according to AA figures. As of yesterday, the UK average petrol price was 129.18p a litre - the lowest since February 23 2011 - while the average diesel price was 133.55p a litre, the lowest since February 6 2011. AA public affairs head Paul Watters said: 'Asda triggered something of a supermarket price war on Tuesday, which was enough to send average UK pump prices to their lowest for more than three years. The average motorist today is approximately £4.40 a tank better off compared to this time last year . 'A year ago, petrol (137.33p) and diesel (141.62p) were more than 8p a litre more expensive. For a typical 55-litre fuel tank, drivers are £4.40 better off.' But he added that the UK was still lagging behind most of Europe when it came to falls in prices. Mr Watters said: 'Drivers on the Continent have been enjoying these lower prices sooner. Despite the UK fuel industry's claim to sell the cheapest petrol in Europe before tax, new EU figures show that fierce competition from fuel-price regulation drove Austrian pre-tax prices even lower. Asda has introduced a fuel cap in advance of the bank holiday weekend which will benefit motorists planning a late summer getaway. A spokesperson said: 'We’re giving our customers and holiday makers the opportunity to fill up their cars with some of the cheapest fuel prices in the market for years, putting much needed cash back in their pockets as the summer holidays begin. UK fuel prices have fallen to levels not seen since 2011 as a result of a Supermarket price war . 'A full tank of fuel now costs £5 less than last summer and our national price cap benefits everyone across the country, meaning that no-one filling up at Asda will be forced to pay a premium for their fuel because of where they live.' RAC fuel spokesman Pete Williams said: 'We’ve been calling for petrol and diesel prices to fall for some time following the decrease in wholesale prices and so this is a welcome move by the supermarkets. 'We would expect to see other retailers to follow in the coming days giving consumers a great opportunity to fuel up ahead of the bank holiday.'","Asda price cut means motorists are saving almost £5 per tank of fuel .

"By . Ryan Parry In Mission, Canada . She is a global sex symbol whose image once adorned posters plastered across every teenage boy’s bedroom wall. In a fairy tale story Pamela Anderson soared from a sweet volleyball-playing school girl raised in a tiny Canadian fishing town to a global superstar who posed on the front cover of Playboy magazine before grabbing international fame as sexy life-guard CJ on hit TV show Baywatch. But today in a treasure trove of never-before-seen photos obtained exclusively by MailOnline, we can reveal Pamela as you’ve never seen her before. Scroll down for video . Innocence lost: Our exclusive photograph shows Pamela Anderson, a 14-year-old ninth grader in 1981, when she claims she was gang-raped . In a gallery of amazing photos the star is seen before she dyed her hair peroxide blonde and paid thousands for plastic surgery on her lips and breasts. In one photograph taken when she was a 14-year-old in ninth grade, she is the picture of innocence. But that angelic image is shattered - because it was the same year she was gang-raped by seven boys, she recently claimed. During her school days the now glamorous actress turned animal activist was a plain-looking teen with naturally straight brown hair instead of today's fashionable blonde locks. Pamela’s high-school sweetheart Ty Anderson shared his treasured snaps with MailOnline - photos he has kept locked away for 30 years. Ty showed off pictures of Pamela at her most casual, at an 80s pool party with friends and at the Expo 86’ world fair event in Vancouver. In a series of other pictures you can see how she fell into the fashions of the time; all perms and baggy sweaters, that are cringeworthy to look back on now. But most revealing is Ty’s stunning amateur shots of Pamela posing in sexy lingerie at 18 - her rookie photo shoot premiere. Splish splash: Ty shared this picture of Pam at a pool party in 1984. She is already toying with the blonde look she became so famous for . Rites of passage: Here Pamela is pictured at her prom and her graduation in 1985. Ty said Pam was 'plain-looking' but still in the top ten most beautiful girls at school at the time . The series of snaps includes her first ever topless photo – taken before she appeared in Playboy. Pamela sent the pictures, taken by a friend of the teen, to Ty as a saucy gift. He recalls: 'I was blown away. Pamela had a fantastic body and I was a very, very lucky guy. That was her first rookie shoot, she looked hot. ‘By the time she was 18, the curves that made her famous were pretty well developed and we enjoyed a very physical relationship. 'And when you’re that age and your girlfriend sends you topless and lingerie photos - what would any boy think?' After graduating from Highland Secondary school in Comox, Canada, where Ty and Pamela met, Ty moved to Red Deer in Alberta to become a fire-fighter while Pamela stayed home. 'We missed each other like crazy,' said Ty. 'So Pam sent me lots of love letters including one with all these photos.' Fairest of the fair: Ty took this picture of Pam at the World Expo '86, in the full swing of 1980's fashion . Fashion faux pas:: Like everyone, Pam has awkward photos from the era - all perm and baggy sweaters . Prim & proper: Ty (pictured with Pam in 1985) said: 'She was pretty but she did not dress like the girls do these days, it was clean and innocent back then' In the letter dated November 16, 1985, Pamela wrote: ‘Hi Sexy, I thought I’d send you a little surprise. I hope you like them. It took a lot of guts, but here I am. 'You say I never let you see my body, well you can’t say that anymore. Here I am, in the flesh! I miss making love to you so much. I need you! I’ll always need you…love always, your Pamela xoxo, I’ll never stop loving you.' Ty said: 'Pam had never been that risqué before, even in the letter she says that I always told her she never let me see her body, which was true. So when I saw these photos I was like, “wow she loves me”.' And Ty admits that he bought Pamela one of the sexy lingerie sets the young wannabe model wore for the impromptu shoot. 'I was like, “I got her that outfit”, she looked great in it,' he said. ‘After getting the photos Pam rang me and told me to come home but I said no way you come up here I’m still working. It wasn’t long before we were together again.' Surprise! While Ty was away working, Pam sent him a letter with this topless picture inside.

It took a lot of guts, but here I am' For your eyes only: Pamela, then 18, sent Ty revealing modelling shots in the lingerie that he had bought her . Flaunt it: Ty said: 'Pam had never been that risqué before, . even in the letter she says that I always told her she never let me see . her body, which was true. So when I saw these photos I was like, ""wow . she loves me""' Exhibitionist: Pam was clearly at home striking the sexy poses that would come to make her so famous . Keepsakes: Ty keeps the collection of letters and photographs in a box at home in Mission, Canada . Ty recalls how his girlfriend slowly blossomed from a plain school-girl to voluptuous woman in her late teens. 'Pam . wasn’t anything special when we first met, yes she was pretty but she . was just your average 14-year-old girl, she had her buttons done up to . her neck, she never wore any revealing outfits. 'Pam . was up there in the top ten hottest girls, but she did not dress like the girls do these days, it was clean and innocent back . then.' After Ty received the sexy photos he said Pam moved to Banff, Alberta and got a job at a gym before she moved in with him in Red Deer. Star is born: Pamela hit the big time when she was . spotted at a football game wearing a beer t-shirt. She was chosen by . Labatt’s Blue as their pin-up girl . 'Friends with benefits': Even after they split and Pam went to LA they hooked up when she visited home .

'In 1989 . she did her first Playboy shoot and moved to LA where she became the . ""Tool Time Girl"" on TV show Home Improvement, before I know it I was . watching her in Baywatch.' Watching her transform into the stunning bottle blonde we all know was tough for Ty. ‘Dude she was hot, I was blown away, I was like wow,’ he recalls. Jealousy: Ty, now married with children, said it was hard watching her career and looks take off. 'Dude she was hot, I was blown away, I was like wow' What could have been: 'I . was floored with envy that I couldn't be with her full time,' Ty said. 'By then we . weren’t together, she was writing me and I could have chased her but I . didn't, I was heartbroken .

The peer said Britain would eventually have to work with President Assad to defeat the  insurgency by getting his approval for a bombing campaign in Syria. The row came after the French President Francois Hollande appeared to blame Britain for the rise of Islamic State – also known as ISIS or ISIL. Scroll down for video . Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff, this morning claimed it was time to speak to Bashar Assad . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond this afternoon firmly rejected any proposal to work with President Assad . President Hollande suggested that Parliament decision to block airstrikes on Syria had allowed the terror organisation to flourish, because it had ended any hope of replacing President Assad with members of the moderate opposition fighting him. In August last year, the Prime Minister was humiliated when Labour MPs and Tory rebels defeated the Government, ruling out military action against Assad. The French President said: ‘If, two years ago, we had acted to ensure a transition, we wouldn’t have had Islamic State. If, one year ago, the major powers had reacted to the use of chemical weapons, we wouldn’t have had this terrible choice between a dictator and a terrorist group.’ Former British military chief Lord Dannat rejected President Hollande’s claim – arguing that Parliament had been right to reject military action against Syria. He said: ‘It’s clearly turned out over the past two or three years to be a very diverse, very complicated country – and I think the reason why quite rightly the British Parliament voted against intervention a year ago and we didn’t join American airstrikes is that we couldn’t be certain who we would be supporting.’ Syrian President Bashar Assad, speaking in the country's parliament in Damascus, is fighting Islamic State terrorists in Syria but also moderate citizens calling for his overthrow . A Syrian man mourns over a dead body after an alleged poisonous gas attack fired by Bashar Assad's forces in Douma town, Damascus, in August last year. French President Francois Hollande has attacked Britain for blocking airstrikes against Syrian forces in the wake of the chemical attack . A former Government advisor on anti-terror laws has called on the Government to reintroduce tougher police powers to track extremists. Lord Carlile, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation for the Government, said the decision to scrap Labour’s control order system in favour of more limited terrorism prevention and investigation measures should be revisited. Lord Carlile said: ‘I do think the Government could make a legislative response to the current problem by reintroducing control orders, or beefed-up Tpims, as they are called, to ensure that people who are identified by solid intelligence as presenting this kind of risk can be placed under controls which can prevent them activating their ideas. ‘I think that we can demonstrate that, certainly in the last six or seven years of control orders, they were very effective, including a provision that allowed certain people - if a judge agreed, a very senior judge - to be relocated. ‘Of course, there are no Tpims at all at the moment. The Tpims that were created ran out and the Government decided to have no more, for reasons which I have never understood.’ The remarks are a blow to the Home Secretary Theresa May, who has insisted the public are not in any more danger as a result of watering down the previous Government’s anti-terror legislation. It came as it emerged today that an independent watchdog called for stricter controls on terror suspects months ago. David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation, said changes to the Government's Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures which replaced Labour control order regime, to make them more effective. But he added: ‘What do we do about Assad? 'I think whether it’s above the counter or below the counter a conversation has to held with him because if there is going to be any question of air strikes over Syrian airspace it has to be with the Assad regime’s approval.’ Lord Dannat said: ‘The old saying my enemy’s enemy is my friend has begun to have some resonance with our relationship with Iran and I think it’s going to have to have some resonance with our relationship with Assad.’ But Mr Hammond rejected the former Army chief’s proposal. He said: 'General Dannatt I heard talking about the adage that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. I’ve said very often that one of the first things you learn in the Middle East is that “my enemy’s enemy is not necessarily my friend”. He added: ‘We may very well find that we are aligned against a common enemy, but that doesn’t make us friends with someone. It doesn’t make us able to trust them, it doesn’t enable us to work with them. ‘It would poison what we are trying to achieve in separating moderate Sunni opinion from the poisonous ideology of [IS] if we were to align ourselves with President Assad.’ The Foreign Secretary also said that he does not believe the President has the authority to reject military intervention from other countries. He said: ‘I don’t know where the idea comes from that Assad has to assent to a military intervention in his country, there’s a civil war raging in his country.’ Mr Hammond also rejected that Britain would be providing lethal support to the Syrian moderate opposition. Defeating the Islamic State terror network will require the US and its allies to take on the terror group in Syria, America’s top-ranking military official said last night. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the group could not ultimately be beaten without Syria featuring in America’s broader strategy alongside the airstrikes Washington is currently carrying out in Iraq. General Dempseys said: ‘This is an organisation that has an apocalyptic, end of days strategic, vision that will eventually have to be defeated. ‘Can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organisation that resides in Syria? The answer is no. ‘They will have to be addressed on both sides of what is at this point a non-existent border. That will come when we have a coalition that takes on the task of defeating Isis over time.’ The comments, delivered in a joint briefing with Chuck Hagel, the US defence secretary, came as Washington continued its assault campaign against the militant group in Iraq, targeting areas close to the beleaguered Mosul dam, according to the Pentagon. David Cameron was humiliated after Labour joined forces with Tory rebels to vote down military strikes against Syria . Mr Hagel, for his part, refused to rule out the prospect of US airstrikes in Syria, saying that the administration was ‘exploring all options’. He insisted that the Islamic State posed one of the biggest terror threats the world had yet seen, warning that defeating the group would be a long-term mission. ‘They are beyond just a terror group. This is beyond anything we’ve ever seen,’ said Mr Hagel, noting that the organisation was extremely well funded and ‘sophisticated’. General Dempsey added that immediate threat stemmed from the risk of jihadists from Europe returning to their home nations with plans of attack on their own soil. ‘They can go home at any point,’ he said. The Islamic State insurgency in northern Iraq and Syria is, it seems, leading to a significant redrawing of political allegiances across the Middle East – at least temporarily. Calls for political engagement with the Ba'athist regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as well as the theocrats of Iran have made them unlikely potential bedfellows of the U.S. and its European allies. Just 12 months ago, Western lawmakers were seriously debating launching air strikes against Syrian Army positions in an effort to halt its resistance to rebels who sought to overthrow the dictatorship. Now those very rebels' Syrian strongholds are all but in the sights of the U.S. Air Force's drones and bombers, while a senior UK parliamentarian has identified Assad as the enemy's enemy who is now our friend. Iran too was facing the threat of military action to halt the nuclear programme which Israel, in particular, feared was working towards an atomic weapons programme. But with the U.S. saying it may deploy limited 'boots on the ground' to defend American interests in Baghdad there is the bizarre prospect of GIs standing shoulder to shoulder with Iranian Revolutionary Guards already stationed in Iraq. Meanwhile, Israel's recent air and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, ostensibly against Hamas militants but effectively hitting thousands of Palestinian civilians, has seen the Jewish state's international standing plummet. And there are questions about how far Islamic State's power and influence is down to the help of wealthy individuals in Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich U.S. ally. The kingdom is well-known for espousing a fanatic form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, whose adherents, like the Islamic State's militants, are violently opposed to the beliefs of Shia Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere.","Lord Dannatt said UK and US will have to open negotiations with Assad .

"By . Cindy Tran . Calls to reduce speed limit to 30km/h would help save lives and prevent accidents, says an Adelaide University cycling expert. Dr Jennifer Bonham told The Advertiser that reducing speed limit on residential roads should be highly considered for the safety of cyclists, as well as pedestrians and drivers. The senior lecturer and author is currently undertaking an Australian Road Research Board, a project which received $45,000 funding last month. Dr Bonham told Daily Mail Australia that the project will look at the type of road infrastructure, which is being put in place across Australia to improve safety and convenience for cyclists. Reducing speed limit on residential roads should be highly considered for the safety of cyclists, as well as pedestrians and drivers . 'We are interested in how cyclists and motorists interact with this infrastructure and whether it is effective to assuring safety and convenience for all road users,' she said. 'The keys to improving safety cycling is design, construction and regulation of all roads to ensure the safety and convenience of all road users. The Adelaide Government reported the move of speed limit cut last year had save an estimated 100 lives and $1 billion in property damage and health costs. In 2011, the government reduced limits from 110km/h to 100km/h on 864km of regional roads. Calls to reduce speed limit to 30km/h would help save lives and prevent accidents for cyclists . Places like the Netherlands do no more than 30km/h in residential areas as this is regarded as the safest speed . Dr Bonham said that the positive impact of reducing suburban speed limits from 60km/h to 50km/h highlighted the benefits of slower travelling car. 'I'm suggesting we should try 40km/h and if at some future point - especially as we get more intense (housing) development in suburban areas - we may want to travel at no more than 30km/h.' 'So we get used to 40km/h and then start thinking about if we need to move to further reductions,' she said. The trend to reducing speed limits are already common in some European countries. 'In places like the Netherlands you can’t do more than 30km/h in residential areas because they regard this as the safest speed and they have been doing this for 40 years,' she said. The Centre for Accident Research & Road Safety found an average of 35 cyclists are killed and over 25,000 are seriously injured on Australian public roads each year.","Reducing speed limit on residential roads should be considered for the safety of cyclists .

"By . Nicky Harley . Council spent thousands and took two years to mend a bridge which had been weakened by lorries. But when cars finally managed to get back on it they realised many couldn’t squeeze through the gap. Now just a month after reopning drivers are turning round at the tiny width restriction on the road which leads to the bridge – rather than trying to shoehorn their cars in to the tight gap. The new measures were put in place to stop vehicles wider than two metres entering an area where large lorries had caused more than £30,000 of damage to a bridge. Even a Seat Ibiza, with a width of 1.7 metres, struggles to navigate the two metre gap in the new road layout . But after reopening at the start of the month, swarms of cars have been forced to turn round and find alternative routes - including cars as small as Minis. Residents branded it 'ridiculous' after black tyre marks were left on the pavement by cars narrowly squeezing through the gap. The traffic calming measures on Wilbury Villas Bridge in Hove, East Sussex, was paid for by Brighton and Hove City Council as part of bridge repairs. However, some of the UK's most popular cars, the Nissan Qashqai (width 2.07 metres), the BMW 3 Series (width 2.03 metres) and even a Mini Paceman Cooper (2 metres), can't fit through the restriction. Melanie White, business manager of the Dock cafe on neighbouring Lorna Road, said: 'Within 10 minutes of opening two people hit it, you can see all the black tyre marks on the side. 'It's stopping the wrong kind of people, it isn't stopping delivery drivers and white van men who take it at 30 or 40 miles an hour straight through. 'The restriction was supposed to make things better for the cafe but it really hasn't.' Resident Andy Wooler, 58, added: 'I understand there's a weight limit on the bridge but this is bad for anyone who drives anything big. 'The design is just ridiculous, this council can't spend money quick enough, how much are we spending on this?' Residents say the new road layout is 'ridiculous' and watched people hit it within 10 minutes of it opening . The road has been designed to stop heavy vehicles using the bridge but cars are being forced to do U-turns . The road was previously forced to close when the bridge was damaged by heavy goods vehicles, which were up to six times bigger than the bridge's three tonne vehicle capacity limit. A spokesman for Brighton and Hove City Council said: 'It's tight but easily negotiated by cars with care at low speed. 'There's a weight limit on this bridge - HGVs are not allowed on it. 'The narrowing will help ensure the weight limit is obeyed, that HGVs stay off the bridge, preventing it getting damaged, closing again and causing much worse long-term inconvenience for all drivers.'","Council spent two years mending road bridge damaged by heavy lorries - but many cars can't fit .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Nearly 200 migrants are feared to have drowned after a boat sank less than a mile from the coast of Libya during an attempted crossing to mainland Europe. The small vessel - which was crammed with men, women and children - sank late on Friday near Qarabouli, 35 miles east of the capital Tripoli, according to the local coast guard. It comes as Italy's maritime search and rescue team are being called upon to retrieve hundreds of migrants who are trying to flee North Africa via the Mediterranean Sea on a daily basis. Members of the Libyan coast guard retrieve a body from the water - one of 200 feared to have gone down with a small vessel that tried to cross to mainland Europe . A body  is discovered in the water one mile off the coast of Libya after a vessel crammed with migrants sank . A Libyan coastguard spokesman Abdellatif Mohammed Ibrahim said: 'A few miles off the coast, we found the remains of a wooden boat which had some 200 migrants on board. 'We managed to save 16 people and recovered 15 bodies, but the search continues for some 170 people who disappeared at sea.' He added: 'It seems that among them are Somalis and Eritreans in addition to other nationalities. One of the fatalities was an 18-month-old child.' Around 3,500 migrants and 19 corpses have been discovered since Friday during a spate of attempted journeys by traffickers trying to take advantage of calmer summer seas. The Italian ship Sirio recovered 18 corpses and 73 survivors from a raft, after a frigate picked up one corpse along with 1372 survivors on Friday night. The Mare Nostrum search and rescue mission began after a shipwreck near Italy's coast killed 366 people last October. More than 200 passengers are feared to have drowned in a desperate attempt to make it to Europe . The mission costs around 9 million euros (£7.5 million) a month and has sparked fierce debate in Italy, which slipped back into recession in the second quarter after years of stagnation. A breakdown of order in Libya since the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi has been exploited by human traffickers, pushing the number of arrivals into Italy since January past 100,000. At the frontier between Europe and Africa, Italy has long attracted seaborne migrants, but the number of arrivals this year is already above a previous record of just over 60,000 for all of 2011, when the Arab Spring uprisings fuelled migration. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has called on the European Union to take responsibility for rescuing migrants by investing in border control agency Frontex, and on the United Nations to intervene in Libya to manage the flows of refugees. A shoe belonging to an illegal immigrant floats on the water after the boat carrying men, women and children sank. The victims were among the hundreds trying to flee Libya on a daily basis .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

William is understood to be keen not to . let down the organisers as the event, being held at the Odeon in . London’s Leicester Square . He will meet the cast and beneficiaries . By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent . The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has pulled out of attending the high profile British premiere of The Hobbit in London tomorrow due to her continuing sickness. Kate, 30, who was hospitalised last week after developing hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition which leaves sufferers battling constant nausea and vomiting, suffered a relapse on Sunday and is now deemed too ill to attend the charity gala. Royal sources stressed there was no cause for alarm and said Prince William would attend without his wife as planned. Scroll down for video . Kate who was hospitalised last week after developing hyperemesis gravidarum is now deemed too ill to attend the charity gala . But it is clear that the Duchess has been hit badly by the illness, which affects three in every one thousand pregnant women, and she will continue to rest quietly at their home in Kensington Palace for the foreseeable future. A spokesman for the couple announced today: ‘The Duchess of Cambridge will not attend The Hobbit Premiere tomorrow evening and will continue to rest privately. The Duke of Cambridge will attend as planned. ‘ . William is understood to be keen not to let down the organisers as the event, being held at the Odeon in London’s Leicester Square, is the official 65th Royal Film Performance and is the principle fundraiser for The Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund’s (CTBF’s), which supports film and television industry employees and their families in times of hardship. Before the performance of Academy Award winner Sir Peter Jackson’s ‘The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’, the royal  will meet trustees and beneficiaries of the charity, the film makers and members of the cast. Kate, who is barely eight weeks pregnant, was hospitalised for three days last week after repeated vomiting left her severely dehydrated. Although Kate has relapsed, William is keen not to let down organisers and will attend alone . She was admitted to the King Edward V11 Hospital in London on Monday where her condition was stabilised by introducing fluids and nutrients via an intravenous drip. She was finally  sent home on Thursday morning with a batch of anti-sickness tablets - and strict instructions to rest. On Saturday night William, also 30, attended a tennis gala in London without her where he tried to make light of the awfulness of his wife’s condition as he told fellow guests: ‘They shouldn't call it morning sickness as it's a day and all night sickness.’ The Duke of Cambridge attended the Winter Whites Gala in aid of Centrepoint at the Royal Albert Hall in London . The following day, however, he was forced to cancel a planned appearance at the British Military Tournament at Earl’s Court after she fell ill again. At this stage her condition is not deemed serious enough to require further hospital treatment, but doctors are keeping a close eye on the Duchess to ensure she does not becomes dehydrated again. The couple are now spending the day quietly together at Nottingham Cottage, the home they share in the grounds of Kensington Palace, as Kate attempts to recover. A St James's Palace spokesman said: ‘It is well known that hyperemesis gravidarum often recurs and, until further notice, to allow the Duchess a degree of privacy during her pregnancy, we do not intend to offer regular condition checks or advise of routine developments associated with it.’ Hyperemesis gravidarum can cause such severe sickness and nausea that sufferers can even vomit blood. It is thought to be caused by elevated levels of the ‘pregnancy hormone’ hCG, which the body begins to produce after conception. The condition tends to appear at around six to eight weeks into pregnancy and for most sufferers disappears towards the end of the first trimester. But for some it can go on as long as five months into the pregnancy and, occasionally, right until birth. Consultant obstetrician Daghni Rajasingam, spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said that once out of hospital, it is important sufferers maintain their intake of fluids and eat small amounts as they will no longer be on a drip. She said: ‘Essentially, women who have hyperemesis gravidarum would just be resting and maintaining hydration, and maintaining their food intake as much as they can and controlling the nausea and vomiting symptoms. ‘They should eat anything they find palatable, what they can keep down, it's a matter of working out the things that make the nausea worse. It's different for different women. ‘Fluid intake is really key, water being the best liquid.’ Prince William will meet trustees and beneficiaries of the charity, the film makers and members of the cast . The condition can cause extreme weight loss but Ms Rajasingam said women will put the weight back on once they are eating and drinking again. She added: ‘It's directly related, really, to how much vomiting they have had and if they are managing to keep food down and absorbing calories from what they eat.’ Asked about the amount of rest the Duchess is likely to need, Ms Rajasingam said: ‘The sort of advice a woman would be given would be to take it easy over the next few days and be reasonable about the amount of activities depending on how active they were before. ‘The advice would be to be sensible and to do things in moderation, but certainly a period of rest and recuperation is good.’ And she did not rule out the Duchess being readmitted to hospital, especially if the sickness last for longer than three months saying: ‘For a small group of women it may continue [longer than three months], and for an even smaller group of women it goes on until the baby is born. For them, further periods in hospital may be necessary.’ Before the performance of Academy Award winner Sir Peter Jackson¿s 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey', Prince William will meet the cast . Hyperemesis gravidarum is treated by giving women fluids intravenously and by anti-sickness tablets. Other ways of stopping symptoms apparently include eating ginger, using pressure bracelets or sucking on ice lollies. Last week the Mail revealed that William is currently on compassionate leave from his role as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot but is due back at work at RAF Valley on Anglesey towards the end of next week and may be forced to leave his wife in London if her condition persists. The couple have also yet to make a decision on where they will spend Christmas. Sources close to William say he is unlikely to be working, but need to confirm whether they will join the Royal Family at Sandringham for their traditional celebrations or spend it quietly with the Middleton family in Berkshire in light of Kate’s condition.","Kate suffered a relapse of hyperemesis gravidarum on Sunday so cannot attend charity gala tonight .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . In Britain, women are delaying childbirth later than ever: the average age of a woman having her first child is 31 . Egg freezing should be every father’s graduation present to his daughter, a leading fertility expert has suggested. Dr Gillian Lockwood, of the Midland Fertility Centre, where half of Britain’s babies conceived from frozen eggs originated, said young women are still not getting the message about infertility. She told The Times: ‘One part of me wants to say that [egg freezing] should be every dad’s graduation present for his daughter. It would be a very safe, low dose, and you could have 20 beautiful eggs in the freezer. 'But – and it’s a very big but – I’m concerned about how that would alter a woman’s life choices, that they might think: “Well, instead of having a family with Mr Not Quite Perfect, I can afford to wait for Mr Absolutely perfect”. In Britain, women are delaying childbirth later than ever: the average woman here has her first child at 31, compared to 24 in 1962. About 6,500 eggs have been stored in . Britain in the decade since egg freezing was licensed by the Human . Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Yet the chances of conceiving a baby from a frozen egg are low, and preparing for it is a painful, costly process involving potent fertility drugs, chemicals and surgery. Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston is . rumoured to have frozen her eggs, and in a recent episode of the U.S. reality television show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim injected . herself with hormones in preparation for doing the same. But despite egg freezing being something often talked about as a viable option, just 12 babies have been born from frozen eggs in this country. However this may slowly change after a recent report by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) stated that egg freezing is no longer experimental technology. The organisation has recommended that women freeze their eggs in their 20s and 30s to help them conceive later in life. And it is timing that is key, says Dr Lockwood. 'By the time many women decide they want to freeze their eggs, they are often in their late 30s, when their eggs have declined in quality significantly. I get many calls from women around the age of 38 who want their eggs frozen,’ she told the Mail last month. Last year Brigitte Adams decided to freeze her eggs at the age of 38, to safeguard what was left of her fertility . ‘A frozen egg from a 38-year-old will be better than a fresh one from a 42-year-old, but pregnancy is still not very likely.’ Dr Lockwood added that a 30-year-old who freezes her eggs would have a  30-40 per cent chance of having a child. After 38, this falls to 25 per cent. And even freezing your eggs at 30 could have its downsides, she said. 'Will it mean a woman waits around all her life for Mr Perfect, knowing she has healthy eggs from her 30-year-old self in the freezer, but then becomes bitter because she has rejected all the Mr Pretty Well Good Enoughs and found herself single and childless at 45, with frozen eggs that turned out not to work?’ Other experts have cautioned that egg freezing is by no means a fail-safe insurance policy. Dr Magdy Asaad, clinical director of the . London Fertility Centre, says the chances of getting a baby from a . frozen egg are about 1 to 3 per cent for each egg. Also, only eight out of ten eggs survive the thawing process and there are still some concerns about whether egg freezing is effective or safe in terms of the long-term health of children. There have also been suggestions that chemicals applied to the egg wall during flash-freezing could potentially damage the egg. Egg freezing is funded by the NHS if carried out for women having cancer treatment. Otherwise it costs £5,000 per cycle, then £200 a year to pay for safe storage of the eggs. One woman who chose to freeze her eggs was Brigitte Adams. Last year, at the age of 38, she decided to take action to safeguard what was left of her fertility. She told The Times: 'I know I have less than a 30 per cent chance - but it's better than zero chance. I feel I have at least done something proactive and have a back-up plan.' She has gone on to found the website Eggsurance to encourage other women to think about freezing their eggs as an 'insurance policy' that can be used later. Ms Adams was 37 when she started thinking about the procedure. 'I just always expected that at my age I would already have kids. I also had some close friends who were either going through difficult IVF treatments or looking into the adoption process. 'I contacted a fertility doctor in my city who told me to “just get pregnant"". Not exactly what I wanted to hear.' She adds that she assumed because she ate well and exercised that she must have a healthy supply of eggs. 'So I was surprised when I learned that maternal age directly correlates to the health of your eggs.' Her family were incredibly supportive, she says. 'My parents were all for it and even offered to pay for some of the treatment costs. My friends, on the other hand, were shocked initially as they did not know anybody who had had their eggs frozen. 'However, once I explained the procedure to them they were extremely supportive and of great help. You really need a strong support system through a process like this as it is both physically and emotionally challenging.'","Dr Gillian Lockwood said young women are still not getting the message about .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A 'misleading' advert for an electronic cigarette brand which claimed it 'poses no health hazard' has been banned. The website for Nicolites claimed the vapour inhaled and exhaled resembled smoke but was 'completely harmless'. Watchdogs launched an investigation after a complaint the website misleadingly claimed that the product was not harmful and whether that could be substantiated. A person smokes a Nicolite, which the company Nicocigs markets as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes . Following an investigation the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found the ad breached rules regarding ""misleading advertising"" and 'substantiation' and ordered that it should not appear again in its current form. The makers of Nicolites, Birmingham-based Nicocigs, was told to ensure it did not claim products were harmless in future in the absence of adequate evidence. The website claimed: 'Although the vapour inhaled and exhaled when using Nicolite resembles smoke, it's simply a completely harmless vapour. 'The vapour has no odour and does not linger the way tobacco smoke does. So there's no danger of passive smoking posed to those around ""vapers,"" as e-cig users are called. It's the tobacco that's harmful, not the nicotine, which is mildly addictive but poses no health hazard.' The makers claimed the ingredients in their liquid, which was heated to create a vapour, were tested in the UK and had been subject to a toxicology risk assessment to confirm that all of the ingredients were safe and the vapour caused no harm. They said a full safety report had also been conducted on the safety of the inhaled aerosol and it was concluded that 'it was very safe relative to cigarettes and also safe in absolute terms on all measurements we have applied'. Nicolites said there was a long history of research conducted on nicotine and, while there was no doubt that it was addictive, studies had shown that nicotine itself was not the cause of smoking related illnesses. Nicocig claim their product has converted 400,000 smokers to E cigarettes . They said the same pharmaceutical grade nicotine that was used in products such as nicotine patches, gum and inhalators was used in their electronic cigarettes and they could therefore claim that the nicotine would pose no health hazard, in the same way that other nicotine delivery products would not. However, an ASA spokesman said: 'We noted the evidence Nicolites submitted, which took the form of literature reviews or references to individual ingredients in the product and also made reference to studies involving animals. 'Although we did not see any studies in their entirety, we noted one of the documents referred to a trial related to vaporising propylene glycol and children but were concerned about the small scale of the study, the fact it was not on the target audience of the claims, which we presumed to be adults, as well as about whether the ingredient tested reflected the make-up of the advertised product itself. 'It was also unclear whether the inhalation method used reflected that users of the product would experience. 'In addition, we noted the toxicology risk assessment, which also did not take the form of a controlled clinical trial, concluded that the e-cigarette was unlikely to pose a risk to health over and above that of cigarettes. 'We considered, however, the implication of the ad, via claims such as 'it's simply a completely harmless vapour' and 'poses no health hazard' was that the product would pose no risks to health at all. 'For the reasons given, we considered the claims that the product was not harmful had not been substantiated and we therefore concluded that the ad was misleading.' He added: 'The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Nicolites to ensure they did not claim products were harmless in future in the absence of adequate evidence.'","Nicolite advert claimed smoke from e cigarette was a 'completely harmless vapour'

"By . Deborah Arthurs . It is no mystery that men are given a boost by the effects a push-up bra has on the cleavage. But what is more surprising is the effect a boosted cleavage can have on the woman herself. For the first time, scientists have measured the effect an enhanced cleavage has on confidence - and found there is a direct link. The unique study, led by scientists at Manchester University proves for the first time the clear connection between a cleavage-enhancing bra and increased confidence - prompting the study lead, Professor Geoff Beattie, to call for a stop to 'unnecessary boob jobs' Boost: Scientists at Manchester University found that women wearing the . push-up bra demonstrated confidence levels 75 per cent higher than normal . A total of 60 video recordings were made of female participants aged 20 to 55, filmed in three different everyday interactions. Footage was compared of them wearing a push-up bra and wearing their own normal, everyday bra. Professor Beattie and his team analysed the three key micro-behaviours associated with confidence and observed their frequency within the recordings. Smiling - which represents positive emotion and signals confidence increased dramatically by 73 per cent when the women were wearing a push up bra. Averting gaze and breaking eye contact - normally associated with low confidence - decreased by 41 per cent. And self-comforting hand movements such as stroking of the chin or wiping the forehand, which is a signpost to low self confidence, decreased by 64 per cent during the trial. Professor of Psychology at The University of Manchester Geoff Beattie called the results 'striking'. The scientists found women with an enhanced cleavage were more likely to maintain eye contact and showed fewer . physical signs of low confidence . 'The differences are much more pronounced than expected,' he said. 'The study showed emphatically that wearing the cleavage-enhancing bra had a significant effect on nonverbal behaviours that are crucially associated with levels of self-confidence. 'And we know that confidence impacts on performance, both at work and in our personal lives. 'Society places a huge amount of pressure to look a certain way and this impacts on women’s perceptions of their own body image, ultimately affecting their confidence. 'For this study, I wasn’t interested in what women reported about how they felt wearing the different bras – this study was about the actual behaviours they displayed, subconscious indicators that can be much more revealing. 'My hope is that this research might deter women from seeking more drastic solutions to improve their confidence, such as breast augmentation, because it proves for the first time that what women wear can positively affect their behaviour.' This is the first academic study to demonstrate a clear link between confidence and cleavage. The research was independently commissioned by Gossard for its launch of the Super Egoboost push-up bra, which has been two years in development and was used in the trial. Gossard Head Designer Stacey Lindsay who is responsible for the design of the Super Egoboost bra explains: 'We hope this research will prevent more women from having unnecessary plastic surgery to enhance their breasts, especially in light of the recent PIP implant scares. 'It just shows that you don’t have to go under the knife to achieve confidence-boosting killer cleavage.' 'Gossard has been making lingerie for 110 years and we recognise that stunning cleavage in a well designed, well-made bra can boost confidence and give our customers the feelgood factor - but it’s amazing to actually have the scientific seal of approval.'","University of Manchester study proves push-up bra alone significantly boosts confidence .

"By . Rachel Ellis . Shannon Deakin: The 16-year-old died after taking Dianette . A common acne pill taken by thousands of young British women is under investigation following safety concerns. After it was recently linked to four deaths, regulators in France are suspending sales of the hormone treatment Dianette, which is also used as an oral contraceptive and is known to increase the risk of blood clots. In Canada, 11 deaths have been linked to the drug. The European Medicines Agency, which regulates medicines across Europe, announced last week it will now carry out a review into its safety. In the UK, concerns about the drug were raised following the recent deaths of several young women, among them Shannon Deakin in 2011. The 16-year-old from Hoyland, South Yorkshire, had been prescribed Dianette by her GP for acne and had been taking it for around four weeks before she died from an undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis, when a blood clot from her leg travelled to her lungs. Dianette — or Diane-35 as it’s known in France — is prescribed to more than 62,000 British women a year, usually for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal problem affecting young women which leads to multiple small ovarian cysts, irregular periods, acne and excess facial hair. The condition is caused by an imbalance of the male sex hormone testosterone, which women also produce (it’s thought to help muscle strength and contribute to sex drive). Some one in ten women are affected. Typically, it starts after puberty and can last for years. ‘Being overweight increases the chance of getting PCOS, but many women who develop it are fit and well,’ says Dr David Price, a consultant endocrinologist at the Morriston Hospital, Swansea. In Shannon's case, a locum GP put the swelling and redness in her left thigh and 'knife-like' pains down to an infection . ‘I tend to see 17 and 18-year-old girls who have had problems for a couple of years, although it can affect women until their 30s. ‘It can be very depressing for them. Some girls have so much facial hair as a result of the condition that they have to shave. 'Initially, we suggest losing weight or cosmetic treatments, but if they don’t work, then Dianette is often prescribed.’ Dianette is a combination of two drugs — cyproterone (a form of the female hormone progesterone) and ethinylestradiol (an oestrogen), which effectively suppress the effect of testosterone. As progesterone prevents ovulation, Dianette also works as an effective contraceptive. DR DAVID PRICE . While other oral contraceptives carry a small increased risk of blood clots — which can be dangerous and potentially fatal if they travel to the lungs or brain — the type of progesterone in Dianette means the drug has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives. Cyproterone is 65 per cent more likely to cause a blood clot than levonorgestrel (a type of progesterone found in older oral contraceptive pills), according to a review of 25 studies published last year in the European Journal of Contraception And Reproductive Health Care. Dr Price explains: ‘When you prescribe Dianette, you explain to patients there is an increased risk of blood clots, although the risk remains low. 'If you just wanted an oral contraceptive pill, you would go for a different drug which is slightly safer. ‘However, for women with PCOS, Dianette can really help.’ Made by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, Dianette has been available in the UK since 1987, but is only licensed as a treatment for severe acne and excess facial hair. It’s normally taken for three or four months until the skin clears. A spokeswoman for Bayer says: ‘Although Dianette also acts as an oral contraceptive, it should not be used solely for contraception, but reserved for those women requiring treatment for the androgen-dependent conditions.’ Dianette - or Diane-35 as it's known in France - is prescribed to more than 62,000 British women a year, usually for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) The French medicines agency last month revealed Dianette is widely used as a contraceptive in France. It is not clear what the situation is in the UK. The risk of a blood clot while taking Dianette is, however, small. Around 40 of every 100,000 women on it develop a blood clot in one year, compared with between five and ten women in 100,000 who are not taking the drug, according to the Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Low-dose combined contraceptive pills carry the lowest risk of blood clots — approximately half the risk of Dianette. But the Dianette risk is still lower than the risk of a blood clot during pregnancy (about 60 cases for every 100,000 pregnant women). Professor Ellis Downes, a consultant gynaecologist at the Portland Hospital in London, says: ‘For those with acne and symptoms of PCOS, Dianette is a very good medication and I have been prescribing it for 20 years. 'Generally, it is a safe drug and the chance of developing a blood clot is very small.’ The warning signs of a blood clot include pain, swelling and tenderness in the leg, and warm and red skin — but many patients and doctors are still unaware of the symptoms, according to Lifeblood, the thrombosis charity. In Shannon Deakin’s case, a locum GP put the swelling and redness in her left thigh and ‘knife-like’ pains down to an infection. She was prescribed antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, but died 12 hours later. An inquest heard the GP should have examined her calves, where swelling is a tell-tale sign of a blood clot. However, as blood clots are ‘extremely rare’ at her age, there was no family history and she’d only been on the pill for a brief period, the GP’s actions were deemed ‘reasonable’. The MHRA maintains the drug is safe. ‘Despite recent developments in France, we have no new concerns and there is no need for a woman who is feeling well to stop taking her medicine. ‘If women have any concerns about their treatment, they should contact their doctor.’","French regulators have suspended sales .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Gonorrhoea is spread during unprotected sex . Cases of 'untreatable gonorrhoea' have soared 25 per cent in a year, as experts warn the disease is becoming more resistant to treatment. More than 20,000 new cases of the sexually-transmitted infection were diagnosed in 2011. The spike has led to the launch of a new campaign to tackle the growing threat in England and Wales in a bid to reverse the trend. Health experts are hoping the first . Gonorrhoea Resistance Action Plan will increase awareness of the . disease, which is the second most common bacterial STI in England. The plan, established by the Health Protection Agency, will monitor the global problem of increasing resistance over the last 10 years. It comes after the 2011 data revealed up to a third of reported cases were repeat gonorrhoea infections. Over a third of cases were in men who have sex with men, up from around a quarter in 2010. Professor . Cathy Ison, lead author of the Grasp campaign, said: 'Ensuring . treatment resistant gonorrhoea strains do not persist and spread remains . a major public health concern. 'The Grasp action plan raises awareness of this important issue and sets out practical, measurable actions to extend the useful life of the current recommended therapies in England and Wales.' Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium responsible for the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea . Gonorrhoea is treated with a single dose of antibiotics which are at least 95 per cent effective, according to the NHS. However, if left untreated it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or infertility. In England and Wales, the risk of gonorrhoea resistance developing in current first-line therapies (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) fell slightly for the first time in five years in 2011. However, cases of treatment failure have now been reported globally and, with no new antimicrobial agents in the pipeline, Professor Sally Davies, England's Chief Medical Officer, recently advised government to add the threat of infection resistance to frontline antibiotics to the civil emergencies risk register. Prof Davies said: 'We have seen a worrying rise in cases of drug resistant gonorrhoea over the last decade. 'Antimicrobial resistance to common drugs will increasingly threaten our ability to tackle infections and the Health Protection Agency's work is vital to addressing this threat.'","21,000 cases of gonorrhoea were diagnosed in 2011 .

Tragic: Toddler Jayden-Lee Green, pictured with his mother Sonia Britton, died after his addict parents gave him the heroin substitute methadone . Both had deliberately given little Jayden-Lee the liquid for up to eight months before his death - which was caused either by one fatal dose or a build-up of methadone in his system. Police found a small measuring cup with traces of methadone on it, which the parents used to administer doses to Jayden when he was 'grisly'. Green was jailed for nine years today at Bristol Crown Court, after a jury of six women and six men unanimously found he had administered the fatal and previous doses and was guilty of manslaughter. Crack cocaine and heroin addict Britton was cleared of manslaughter but jailed for four years after the jury convicted her of allowing a child to die and administering methadone to her son. Both parents wept in the dock as the verdicts were returned - with Green telling jurors 'you're wrong' as they left the court. Jailing Green, The Honourable Mr Justice Parker told him: 'There were times when Jayden's needs were simply too much for you. Jayden had to be pacified, quickly and efficiently. 'The answer was to feed him a dribble of methadone to send him peacefully to sleep so that you could have the rest and tranquillity that you wanted. Jailed: Father Jamie Green was handed a nine-month jail term after a jury unanimously found him guilty of manslaughter . Punished: The Honourable Mr Justice Parker told Sonia Britton (left) and Jamie Green (right) they would suffer 'a prolonged anguish' for failing to protect their infant son . 'Jayden was crying and miserable, he simply would not settle down. You reverted to the remedy that had, on other occasions, been the quick solution. 'Only you know whether the methadone was fed in one amount or had been drip fed over a period of time that day to the point where Jayden's small body could no longer give resistance and he died. 'You will suffer a prolonged anguish larger than any prison sentence could impose for what you did to Jayden.' The judge also addressed Britton as he jailed her for four years, saying: 'You were his mother and you knew what was happening. You did nothing. 'You were a loving and devoted mother and you will have a prolonged anguish for failing to protect your small boy.' The three-week trial jury heard that tests on Jayden-Lee found quantities of the drug at a similar level to an adult on a methadone programme - suggesting 'repeated exposure' over a 'long period of time'. The toddler had filthy legs, a soiled nappy and methadone stains on his vest when he was discovered dead on his parents bed in their squalid and cramped one-bedroom flat in Bristol. Both of his parents, from Bristol, told police Jayden-Lee could not have accessed the methadone bottle - fitted with a child lock - himself. Neglected: The judge said Green and Britton had dosed their baby boy with methadone as a quick fix when they were unable to pacify him . Poisoned: Police found a small measuring cup with traces of methadone on it, which the parents used to administer doses to calm their son 'like Calpol' Mr William Mousley, prosecuting, previously told the jury that Jayden-Lee died at the hands of his parents, who had been together for 13 years. He said: 'Jayden-Lee was poisoned by being given methadone, a controlled drug used in the treatment of heroin addiction. 'The drug was prescribed to both Sonia Britton and Jamie Green at the time and was kept on top of a kitchen cupboard - out of any child's reach. 'It must have been given to him by an adult and only Sonia Britton and Jamie Green were in a position to do so. 'This was not the first time that Jayden-Lee had been given methadone. 'Death followed that last dose and may have been caused by it alone - or it contributed significantly to it as a result of the cumulative effect of the previous taking of methadone.' Killed by his own parents: By the time Jayden-Lee was found dead, rigor mortis had already set in . Appalling: Pub-goers said Jayden-Lee was 'totally exhausted' and 'crying' the night before he died - and that his father tried to make him ride a plastic tricycle . Jayden-Lee was taken to the couple's local pub, the Mechanics Arms, the night before his death and was only taken home when the landlord insisted at 8.30pm. Horrified regulars told the court how the toddler was 'totally exhausted' and 'crying' as his father repeatedly tried to make him ride a plastic tricycle. But when they returned back to the cramped and dirty flat, Britton and Green began a drinking session with a friend - downing a bottle of vodka between them. Britton took a 'clingy' and 'miserable' Jayden-Lee to bed at around 2.30am. She awoke at 6.45am but left the youngster to sleep. She did not check on him until 12.30pm on August 21 last year - when she discovered him dead, with rigor mortis having set in. Mr Mousley added: 'While each of them cared about Jayden-Lee, he was not their priority. They were drug addicts whose need for drugs came before Jayden-Lee. 'One of the officers who attended the property noticed that it smelled of cannabis. There was a potty in the living room that was full of urine.' Gone too soon: Prosecutor William Mousley told the court that both addicts cared about their son, but that drugs were their top priority . Post-mortem tests on Jayden-Lee's blood showed he had taken 'a significant amount of methadone' hours before his death, while hair samples showed the drug had been in his system for a 'long period of time'. Forensic tests found Jayden-Lee's DNA on an empty 45ml bottle of methadone prescribed to Green, which had been thrown in the kitchen bin. After their arrests, both Green and Britton confirmed Jayden-Lee would not have been able to access the methadone himself - but said they did not know how it came to be in his body. They denied charges of manslaughter, allowing or causing a child to die and cruelty to a person under the age of 16, by giving Jayden-Lee methadone between January 1 and August 22 last year. The day after finding his son dead, Green left a tribute to him on Facebook which read: . 'Rip jayden-lee with the angles my first born mummy and daddy love u loads rip are little man words cannot say how broken we are love u baby boy your broken hearted mummy and daddy x x xxx.' [Sic].

"By . Emma Innes . Making a cup of tea or potting a plant in the garden may sound like simple, day-to-day tasks. But until recently, Corporal Andrew Garthwaite could barely imagine being able to complete them with ease. Now the soldier, who lost his right arm to a Taliban rocket-propelled grenade, is  able to live a normal life – after becoming Britain’s first person to be fitted with a bionic limb controlled by the mind. Scroll down for video . Corporal Andrew Garthwaite, 26, is believed to be the first person in Britain to be given a bionic hand that he can control with his brain . Incredibly, the 26-year-old has only . to think of moving a hand, arm or fingers and the false arm responds . accordingly. The robotic prosthetic – described as ‘the stuff of science . fiction’ – means the married serviceman can pull on his own socks, . cook, drive and use bank cards. He said yesterday: ‘The surgery has . made a massive improvement to my life. I have become a lot more . independent and all the normal things I was struggling with have become . so much easier. ‘When . I first got told about the operation I thought it was some sort of . fairy tale. But here I am today with this arm that is fitted and works . off my mind.’ The soldier, of South Shields, South Tyneside, took a . direct hit from a rocket in the insurgent stronghold of Nad-e Ali, . Afghanistan, in 2010. A close friend was killed in the  attack. Cpl . Garthwaite said: ‘I heard a bang and within a split-second I was on the . floor and my arm was on fire. I stood up and thought, “Oh, God” and my . arm just fell off.’ He initially received a traditional prosthetic, which allowed him to perform a limited range of tasks. But in January last year, he was flown to the Medical University of Vienna in Austria. There, . doctors ‘rewired’ the severed nerve endings from his shoulder – which . had controlled his hand – into his chest. Electrodes were delicately . attached to his chest and connected to a tiny computer fitted on the . prosthetic limb. Corporal Garthwaite lost his arm while serving in Afghanistan in 2010. He is pictured wearing muscle sensors before the robotic arm was fitted . Corporal Garthwaite had to have seven hours of surgery to rewire his nervous system before the new arm could be fitted. Graphic shows how the muscle sensors control the robotic arm . Corporal Garthwaite was injured when a grenade exploded in Helmand Province . Now when he imagines moving his missing arm, . electronic brain pulses travel through the nerve endings and the . electrodes, sending messages to the micro-computer. The soldier, who . serves in the Queen’s Royal Lancers, can now open and close his hand, . extend his fingers and rotate his wrist. Sensors in the prosthesis . will soon let him feel different temperatures. In carefree moments, he . can make his wrist spin 360 degrees. ‘That is my party trick,’ he joked. The Defence Ministry is paying the £60,000 cost of his bionic arm and surgery. Nerve endings from Corporal Garthwaite's shoulder, which would have run down to his hand, were instead rewired into his chest muscles . For 18 months Corporal Garthwaite has had the sensation of a hand growing in his chest . The soldier has had to learn how to control his hand with electrodes sending signals to his new arm so that he can control it with impulses from his brain . Steve . Lambert, a lead prosthetic technician at the Headley Court military . recovery centre  in Surrey, said working with Cpl Garthwaite had ‘put a . lump in my throat’. Defence minister Anna Soubry said: ‘It’s the stuff of almost science fiction coming to reality.’ Cpl . Garthwaite is being medically discharged from the Army. But after . spending Christmas with his wife and family, he plans to explore fresh . career opportunities – bolstered by his bionic arm. He said: ‘Having . lost a lot of friends through my Army career in Iraq and Afghanistan, I . know I’m very lucky to be here. It makes you realise it could have been . you.’ Corporal Garthwaite said: 'When I first got told about the operation I thought it was some sort of fairy tale, that someone was taking the mickey. But here I am today with this arm that is fitted and works off my mind. It's unbelievable' Corporal Garthwaite has demonstrated that he can carry out everyday tasks such as potting a plant and making a jam sandwich using his prosthetic arm . He said: 'There is no point in looking back because you can never turn back time. I am still very lucky to be here. With this new life I have got, hopefully I can be very successful'","Corporal Andrew Garthwaite lost his arm serving in Helmand Province .

"By . Daniel Martin . Foreigners travelling to Britain to exploit the NHS is costing us billions every year . The ‘massive and escalating problem’ of foreigners travelling to Britain to exploit the NHS is costing us billions every year, a senior doctor has warned. In a dramatic expose of the extent of health tourism, a leading surgeon said the cash-strapped Health Service is becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’ as expectant mothers arrive just to give birth. Thousands of others are flying here for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment – and then leaving without paying, according to cancer specialist J Meirion Thomas. Some are so ill - even semi-conscious - that they have to be wheelchaired onto planes in foreign countries and on arrival at UK airports go straight into NHS hospitals. Many arrive specifically to give birth, then argue that they should not be charged because it counts as emergency care. Some are committing identity fraud, but the NHS is powerless to act. And this ‘serial abuse’ could be costing taxpayers billions every year, he warned – far above previous estimates. In a stinging article, Professor Thomas, consultant surgeon at The Royal Marsden hospital in London, cites a string of cases from across the NHS to conclude: ‘It all adds up to clear, widespread abuse of our NHS by ineligible patients.’ But he warned that the NHS may be ‘addled with too many loopholes’ to address the problem and could have ‘reached the point of no return’. Last month David Cameron pledged a crackdown on health tourism, saying he wanted to tighten eligibility to free care and do more to ensure the NHS recoups the money it is owed. The Prime Minister faced criticism when he was unable to put a figure on the extent of the abuse, citing old statistics showing it could be up to £20million a year. In the Spectator magazine, Professor Thomas welcomed Mr Cameron’s pledge, but said he had been ‘overwhelmed’ by letters informing him of the true scale of the problem since writing a piece in the same magazine three weeks ago highlighting how easily foreigners can abuse the NHS. Abuse of the NHS: Thousands of foreigners fly to the UK for treatment according to cancer specialist Professor Thomas . He quoted one from a junior hospital doctor working close to Heathrow airport. ‘Every single week, I see people who have been flown in from all over the world with a variety of extremely serious health problems,’ the letter said. ‘Many of these people had to be wheelchaired on to the plane because they were too unwell to walk on board. ‘We often have our Intensive Therapy Unit full of patients without NHS numbers who are there for weeks or months with no means or intention to pay, which impacts on our resources.’ Professor Thomas said the most ‘revealing and scandalous’ reports come from overseas visitor officers, who are employed by hospitals to identify and recover costs from those not entitled to free care. ‘I have now been contacted by more than a dozen OVOs, desperate to be heard, who have given me scores of cases of abuse covering every aspect of NHS activity,’ he said. ‘Some, fearing reprisal from senior managers, have spoken to me on condition of anonymity. Crackdown: David Cameron has pledged to tighten eligibility to free care . ‘This abuse may be costing the NHS (and therefore the British taxpayer) not millions but billions of pounds every year. The mystery for those of us working in the NHS is how the Department of Health and 40,000 or so hospital managers have allowed this to happen.’ The doctor said maternity health tourism was a ‘massive and escalating problem’, adding: ‘Often the patient refuses to pay, claiming that a childbirth qualifies as emergency care and therefore cannot be refused to anyone. In this way, the NHS can be used as the world’s maternity wing.’ This only adds to the pressure on wards, where birth rates in recent years have consistently proved higher than predicted and a midwife shortage means some have to close their doors because they are at capacity. Professor Thomas said there was also evidence of identity fraud, with blood tests taken in hospital revealing the woman has a different blood group to the one in the NHS records of the person they claim to be. He said renal dialysis was ‘probably the most costly form of abuse’ because the treatment needs to take place three times a week and may result in a kidney transplant. Cancer patients often travel to the UK for treatment which they do not pay for, he said, adding: ‘The NHS does not have the resources for such largesse.’ Professor Thomas called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to hold a national audit on the extent of the problem. The audit should be ‘manager-free’, he said, ‘because it is the mandarins and officials who have presided over the genesis and evolution of the current problem’. A spokesman for the Department of Health said the Government was determined to crack down on health tourism, adding: ‘The NHS should only be providing care to those entitled to its support, which is why we have announced plans to prevent unfair access and improve the NHS’s ability to charge for the full cost of treatment, where appropriate.’","Leading health surgeon described the NHS as the 'world's maternity wing'

"By . Ruth Styles . They've got the Bugaboo pushchair and the Moses basket, and the Duchess of Cornwall has stocked up on organic baby food. Now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been sent a Finnish maternity kit - which comes complete with a snowsuit, a teething toy and a pint-sized duvet - as they prepare for the impending birth of their first child. The kit, which is issued to every Finnish mother, contains everything a new parent could possibly need while the box it arrives in doubles as a crib. Scroll down for video . Generous: The Finnish Government has sent the Cambridges a maternity kit that includes a cardboard crib . Thanks Finland! Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and the Duchess of Cambridge both got a baby box . Source: BBC . Items provided include socks and mittens, a knitted hat, a balaclava, a mattress, a selection of babygros and, more surprisingly, a box of nursing bra pads and some condoms. The box also includes a set of non-disposable nappies - chosen, according to Tanja Jääskeläinen, the deputy head of mission at the Finnish Embassy in London, with the planet in mind. 'I cannot imagine that we would use commercial nappies,' she told the Times. 'It is always these traditional ones. 'I don't know how much people use them but people are more environmentally conscious now.' She added: 'It is something that every mother looks forward to receiving, especially when you have your first child. 'There's so much that you don't know you need. When the box arrives, you look at the clothes and think, ""They are so cute"". You cannot imagine your baby is so small. Then the baby arrives and most of the things are too big. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'We were delighted to receive the very kind gift of a maternity package from the Finnish Government. 'It was a very thoughtful gesture. I'm sure the Duke and Duchess will be very interested to see the contents.' Is that for me? Camilla is handed a box of organic baby food while on a visit to the Rhug Estate in Gwynedd . What's in there? The Prince of Wales inspects the contents of his wife's Rhug Estate shopping bag . Although the Cambridges are the first members of the British Royal family to be sent the maternity kit, they aren't the only blue-blooded recipient. When Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria was expecting her daughter, Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland, last year, she was also sent a box. Other preparations are continuing ahead of the impending Royal birth with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall stocking up on baby food while on a visit to the Rhug Estate in Gwynedd yesterday. The delighted Duchess was handed a box of organic infant treats by officials from baby food manufacturer, Plum. Organic food and the environment are both issues close to Prince Charles' heart who will no doubt also be thrilled by the Finnish Government's choice of eco-conscious terrycloth nappies. 'It’s brilliant that HRH Prince Charles has been given some organic baby food for his first grandchild on his visit to the Rhug Estate,' commented the Soil Association's Jim Twine. Twine, who is the organic foundation's head of business development, continued: 'The Prince will be making a choice to give his grandson or daughter one of the best starts in life in common with more than 50 per cent of parents who choose to buy organic baby food for their infants. 'Organic baby food guarantees parents are buying food produced without the use of almost all pesticides, all synthetic fertilisers and GM crops - ultimately giving parents confidence in the way in which in the food has been produced - with no hidden surprises.' In London meanwhile, workmen outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington could be seen setting up a press pen opposite the entrance to the Lindo Wing where the Duchess of Cambridge, 31, is due to give birth. By last night, members of the world's media were already arriving to stake out their spot, as the baby's due date - 12th July - rapidly approaches.

"By . Clare Goldwin . Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, my mouth open as wide as it will go, I'm attempting to warble vowel sounds, like a singer warming up before a performance. It's a good thing the door is locked - and not just because my tuneless caterwauling means I won't be appearing on The X Factor any time soon. Rather it's because inside my mouth is a bizarre Japanese device that promises it will firm my face and reduce my wrinkles. Miracle wrinkle exterminator? Clare with the Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece . Normally, I'd welcome any chance to roll back the years. I'd love to erase the lines that have come with having two children and turning 40, and re-define a jawline that's starting to sag. And this device has been causing a buzz on the internet. According to its manufacturers, the Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece is all I require for a more youthful look. 'To get and maintain the perfect visage, you don't need the cosmetic surgeon's knife. All you need is the mouthpiece,' they claim in their blurb. It's quite a promise. I am on tenterhooks as I wait for the parcel to arrive. But it's not just the cost of the mouthpiece - £49 - that gives me a shock. This secret weapon in the battle against age is a malleable silicone rubber mould that fits in the mouth behind the teeth and which is attached to oversized sugar-pink lips. It looks as if it would be more at  home in a horror movie than in a family bathroom. The makers blithely claim it's perfect for using 'in front of the mirror, in the bath or at any other convenient time every day'. But while I'm happy to apply make-up and style my hair in my car as I wait at traffic lights, this is one aspect of my beauty routine that won't be put on public view. Never mind the ridicule, I'd be afraid of being arrested. Winning smile? Clare enunciates the five vowel sounds as part of the Face Slimmer exercise regimen . The idea is that you put the mouthpiece in and then pull a series of facial expressions - the shapes you make when you enunciate the five vowel sounds. By repeatedly doing this you supposedly exercise your facial muscles and so tone and de-stress the face, relaxing wrinkles and firming saggy skin. The mouthpiece - which is hinged at the back like a pair of comedy false teeth - apparently provides extra resistance, making the exercises more effective. The manufacturers claim three minutes of  exercising a day is all you need to reap the benefits. It doesn't sound like much, but in a house with a five-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, privacy is hard to come by. Given that I don't want to give my children nightmares by showing them my new 'look', it's surprisingly difficult to find a time when I wont be interrupted. Eventually, I decide to do my exercises in  the evening once the children have gone to bed. The online pictures of a woman demonstrating the anti-ageing exerciser show her making exaggerated mouth shapes, so that's what I do. She also opens her eyes very wide - making her look as if she's being attacked by a pair of  giant lips - so again I follow her example. There's no explanation as to why widening your eyes is beneficial, but perhaps it helps erase crows' feet. Alternatively, it might just be an understandably natural reaction of horror when faced with having to wear the horrible-looking device. Spot the difference? Maybe not . I find that to ensure I’m making the right expressions - smiling when I mouth the letter 'e', opening my mouth very wide for 'i' and pushing my chin forward for 'u' - it’s best if I sing the vowels loudly. While it's not painful to wear, the device is uncomfortable because it distends my mouth. Sometimes I find it makes me dribble unattractively. Doing my facial exercises does not become the favourite part of my day. My husband, passing the bathroom one evening and hearing my warbling, asks if I'm feeling all right. I mumble 'I'm fine' as best as I can: there's no way I’m opening the door and showing him what I look like. I soon get into the habit of doing my facial exercises before going to bed. After a week I wonder if it's making a difference. I wouldn't exactly say that I am seeing the 'more youthful, vibrant' face as promised by the makers, but there is definitely a tightening sensation around my jawline. More worryingly, I think I am developing an intolerance to the mouthpiece. The more I wear it, the more uncomfortable it becomes, catching the back of my throat and making me gag. Still, as we all know when it comes to beauty, there's no gain without pain, so I battle on for a second week. But I am having to take short breaks between making the various vowel sounds, rather than doing them all in one go. Julia Anastasiou is a teacher of face yoga, which is a technique that combines acupressure, massage and facial exercises to give a more youthful look. She's sceptical about the effectiveness of the Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece. 'There are 57 muscles in the face. The technique I teach isolates them, so it's done in a controlled way, but I don't think that repeating vowel sounds would be targeted enough,' says Julia. Dubious: The odd Japanese device . 'And while I can understand the theory that resistance would help, I don't think this is going to make your face look slimmer or erase wrinkles.' So, after two weeks of doing facial exercises with fake lips, what’s my final verdict? Am I looking any younger? Friends say my face possibly looks a little plumper and more toned, though it has to be said the results are on the subtle side. You never know. Perhaps if I can get over my aversion to the mouthpiece, I can keep it in for longer at a time and get more dramatic results. It's either that or I’m back to pinning my hopes for eternal youth on anti-ageing creams and positive thinking.","Makers of Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece promise youthful results .

"By . Emma Innes . More than a million people in the UK now live with a condition that causes the heart to beat irregularly and can lead to strokes. Data from the British Heart Foundation (BHF) shows the UK has, for the first time, topped the million mark in the number of people diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. The figure is up almost 20 per cent on five years ago. More than a million people in the UK now have atrial fibrillation - a condition which causes the heart to beat irregularly and too fast . High blood pressure, heart valve disease and binge drinking are among the causes alongside the fact people are living longer. The heart condition causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate, frequently leading to dizziness and shortness of breath. Sufferers may also feel palpitations and become very tired. However, some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms and are completely unaware that their heart rate is irregular. If left untreated, atrial fibrillation can significantly increase the risk of a blood clot forming inside the heart, which increases the risk of stroke five-fold. The BHF said atrial fibrillation is responsible for 22,500 strokes a year in the UK. People who have atrial fibrillation are five times more likely to have a stroke than people who do not. Image shows a scan of a brain with a stroke . Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the charity, said: ‘The real danger with atrial fibrillation is that some people don't realise they have it. You can be going about your daily routine oblivious to the fact you're five times more likely to have a devastating stroke. ‘Checking that your pulse is regular is a simple way of seeing if you're at risk. But only through research can we tackle this dangerous disorder and prevent its devastating consequences.’ The data was released as part of the BHF's Ramp up the Red fundraising campaign. Richard Elgar, 43, from Dorset, was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation last September. The father-of-two, who is a builder, said: ‘I'd already had a heart attack when I was 36, so finding out I had atrial fibrillation was another blow. ‘I didn't tell my wife about the risk of stroke until I was on medication to help prevent it. ‘I didn't want to worry her and the children. But every tiny ache or twinge still makes me panic that something could be starting that could devastate my family. It's incredibly stressful. ‘I'm currently waiting for further treatment, so I'm not out of the woods yet. More research, funded by the BHF's Ramp up the Red campaign, could help find better ways of treating people like me and make sure my family stays together. ‘We're all set to dig out our reddest outfits for the occasion and I hope thousands of other families will join in too.’ Mr Elgar's eldest son Alfie, eight, completed a 40-mile bike ride last summer to raise funds for the BHF. He continued despite falling off his bike twice because of the heat and exhaustion. The schoolboy has said he wants to be a heart surgeon when he grows up so he can ‘fix daddy’.","More than a million people in the UK have atrial fibrillation .

"By . Katy Winter . Love her or loathe her, she's become the most iconic model of our times, synonymous with high-octane glamour and rock and roll excess. But a 20-year-old advert reveals that Kate Moss was once a relative unknown, very much in the shadow of ‘original’ supermodels Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell, who also appeared in the commercial. The advert was made for the release of Vauxhall Corsa 20 years ago and features a baby-faced, 19-year-old Moss. Kate Moss is just 19 years old in the advert, which sees her ditch her grungy look for Hollywood-style glamour . Linda Evangelista, one of the biggest supermodels of all time, becomes jealous of the Vauxhall Corsa in the tongue-in-cheek advert . At the time, the Croydon-born model was . known for her grungy style, but in the clip she oozes sophistication in a . long, red evening gown. Hair stylist Kerry . Warn, who worked on the ad, said of Kate: 'She was only a teenager, . but I think with the ad, we helped to add some glamour to her image. 'After . seeing the Corsa ad, in which I made her look quite 1960s in style, journalists . and the public realised that although they were used to seeing her in ripped . jeans, she also looked great dressed up as well.” With her hair piled up on her head and 50s-style makeup, Moss features at the very end of the clip, which pitches the car as the ‘new supermodel’. Naomi Campbell plays a dominatrix in the ad, re-shown to mark the Corsa's 20th anniversary . Christy Turlington looks like a stunning 40s film star in the stylish commercial .

"By . Anna Magee . Dr Uchenna Okoye wakes every morning at around 4.30am . Experts say skipping just an hour or two of sleep a night can harm health. But this doesn't bother dentist Dr Uchenna Okoye. She wakes every morning at around 4.30am - out of choice. 'For me, a lie-in is getting up at 6am,'  she says. Usually asleep by around 11pm, Dr Okoye even rises early following nights when she has gone to sleep much later. 'Last night, I had a work do to attend and accounts to get through after that, so I didn't go to bed until 3am,' she says. 'But I automatically opened my eyes at 6am, without setting the alarm. 'It's very rare for me to feel sleepy during the day, and I know as a doctor this is the measure of whether you sleep enough.' Both her parents were early risers and Dr Okoye believes she has inherited this. 'My father used to tell us that sleep was practising death and as kids we had to be at the breakfast table at 6am every day, no matter what happened the day before.' Dr Okoye's husband Chidi Ngwaba, a doctor, used to find her early rising hard to cope with. 'He is the opposite to me - he loves staying up late and sleeping in. To keep the peace, when we go on holidays we always book a suite so I can quietly get up and work in the other room and he can sleep.' The number of Britons who, like Dr Okoye, get just five to six hours sleep a night has risen dramatically in the past three years. A report from the Sleep Council last year suggested that 33 per cent of us get by on five to six hours' a night, compared with 27  per cent in 2010. The average Briton today gets around six hours and 35 minutes' sleep. Only around 5 per cent of us function well on little sleep, so this drop in an average night's resting hours might be deeply worrying. It might also help explain the significant rise in prescriptions for drugs to treat insomnia, including zopiclone  and temazepam. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, fewer than ten million prescriptions were written in 2002, rising to more than 15 million in 2012; one in three people now complains of suffering from bouts of insomnia. However, experts such as Derk-Jan Dijk, professor of sleep and physiology at the Surrey Sleep Research Centre, now emphasise that it's the quality of sleep, rather than the quantity, that is important. 'Sleep need is individual and can vary from five to nine hours,' says Professor Dijk. 'A quality night's sleep isn't necessarily going to be eight hours for everyone.' Sleep with interruptions can reduce its restorative effects, so 'quality sleep' is often defined as being uninterrupted, allowing the body to go through the different sleep stages that restore emotional and physical well-being, he explains. To measure sleep quality, scientists rely on people's daytime sleepiness. 'If you feel sleepy and doze off during meetings, take longer than normal to complete tasks or at weekends sleep much longer, then the sleep you are getting may not be of good quality,' says Professor Dijk. The proportion of people whodon't get to bed until after midnight . Ironically, worrying about getting a full eight hours could be one of things stopping us getting a quality night's continuous slumber. At night, hormones such as melatonin - produced when the body is exposed to darkness - and serotonin - a calming brain chemical - should kick in to make us sleepy. However, when we start to worry about something, the effects of these can be outweighed by stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. For those of us blighted by erratic sleep patterns, doctors now believe Dr Okoye's blase attitude towards slumber could be the key to getting better sleep. 'The paradox is that being less fixated on sleep is the key to getting a better night's sleep,' says Colin Espie, professor of clinical psychology and director of the Sleep Research Laboratory at the University of Glasgow. 'There are things our bodies and brains are designed to do automatically. Sleep is one, and it's determined by biology and genes.' Experts now emphasise that it's the quality of sleep, rather than the quantity, that is important . This means some people naturally need more or less sleep than others, and this can vary widely. The amount you need is wired into your biology like your fingerprint, says Professor Espie. But such natural functions  get impaired by our anxiety to perform them well. 'People with insomnia will often wake in the middle of the night and think: “Oh my God! I can't sleep.” And that starts their  alarm bells. 'They lie there worrying about not sleeping, thinking: 'I am awake again, I am going to perform badly at work tomorrow, I am going to feel awful, I need  to get to sleep.” ' That puts the brain into threat mode, in which the body responds physiologically as though it is being attacked, releasing stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to help it deal with a perceived danger, explains Professor Espie. 'This is the exact opposite to the relaxed state the body needs to be in to fall asleep.' For Dr Okoye, 44, sleeping less has corresponded with getting older. In her 20s and early 30s, she would sleep for seven hours; now it's for about five. This need for less sleep as we get older is not uncommon. 'Many older people still expect to get the eight hours of sleep they got when they were younger and lie in bed worrying about getting less now,' says Professor Dijk. 'This is not necessarily conducive to getting a quality night's sleep. 'People often think there is something wrong, when in reality - if their sleep is of good quality - it's just normal,' he says. In fact, research shows older people who have fewer than the traditional eight hours are less sleepy during the day. In one of Professor Dijk's studies conducted at Harvard Medical School, people over 60 and people in their 20s were asked to spend 16 hours in bed. The older people managed to sleep for only seven-and-a-half hours of that, while the younger ones slept just under nine. Professor Dijk's team recorded their brainwaves and found older people who slept fewer hours were less sleepy during the day than the younger ones. 'Research indicates that older people get less sleep and probably need less sleep, and shouldn't be worried about that,' he explains. 'Sleep is related to plasticity of the brain, it has to do with learning new skills and memory. Young people's brains are always learning and thus need more sleep.' 'They should be worried if they feel sleepy during the day because that indicates they either don't get enough quality sleep or there's some underlying sleep problem.' Of course, there are real forms of insomnia as distinct from that caused by worrying about not getting enough sleep. Research shows older people who have fewer than the traditional eight hours are less sleepy during the day . Typically, these are caused by stress or underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or osteoporosis, or medications including painkillers or antidepressants. Recent research from Harvard Medical School found that increased smartphone and tablet use at bedtime suppressed the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. But if it's quality of sleep, not quantity, that matters, does this mean we can ignore the regular dire warnings about the health effects of lack of sleep? Just last week, a study from Uppsala University, in Sweden, found that being sleep-deprived caused a similar change in the brain to that seen after a head injury. Other conditions that have been linked to chronic lack of sleep include multiple sclerosis, and a greater risk of heart attacks, strokes and angina - possibly because sleep deprivation raises blood pressure, which increases the risk of artery damage. Professor Dijk says there is no good evidence that not getting enough sleep raises the risk of MS.  However he explains: 'For some other conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes, epidemiological evidence suggests that abnormal sleep patterns - defined in most studies as less than six hours a night - are a contributing factor.' So how does the new emphasis on quality, rather than quantity, of sleep square with links to such health problems? 'We don't know the answer to that because most studies have only looked at self-reported sleep duration without measuring sleep quality,' he says. 'Risk increases when you consistently sleep less than your body needs.' Meanwhile, one of the most effective treatments for insomnia caused by sleep anxiety involves asking patients to essentially give up on sleep. Called paradoxical intention therapy (PIT), patients instead try to stay awake. PIT is recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as one of the few evidence-based psychological therapies for sleep, and - although not available on the NHS for sleep problems - is an acknowledged therapy practised by UK psychologists. 'Patients realise that when they try to remain awake, they feel sleepier. People who sleep well don't try to sleep,' says Professor Espie, who has pioneered the study and use of PIT. 'Reading is a classic example, especially if it's an engrossing book, as it's often trying to stay awake and read more that makes people fall asleep naturally,' he explains. And, finally, here's something that might relax those with sleep anxiety - they may be getting more than they think. 'Often we will ask someone who reports having insomnia: “How long did you sleep?” and they say: “Two hours,” ' says Professor Dijk. 'Then we measure their sleep by recording brainwaves and other signals and find they actually slept six-and-a-half or seven hours.' sleepio.com .","Dentist Dr Uchenna Okoye wakes every morning at around 4.30am .

"By . Sophie Borland . Cancer victims are reducing their chances of survival by delaying reporting symptoms because they do not want to waste their doctor’s time. Even though immediately going to a GP increases the chance of the cancer being caught, some are waiting up to a month after noticing signs, research shows. There are concerns many are not aware of the warning signals – or are too embarrassed describing lumps over the phone. Some patients adopt a stoical approach and decide it is not worth bothering their GP. Too stoical: Many cancer patients are waiting up to a month before going to see their GP after they first noticed signs of the disease, researchers have found (stock image) Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe and experts believe it may partly be because patients are delaying seeking help. Typical symptoms that patients ignore include a persistent cough, which could signal lung cancer, or a sore throat and ulcers which could mean throat cancer but are mistaken for a cold. Other symptoms can include general weight loss and tiredness. Delays of a month can be life-threatening, as once patients see their GP and have a diagnosis,  they will still have to wait to be referred to hospital for further tests and scans. It can in fact be several months before they start treatment, by which time the cancer will have spread and become more difficult to treat. Research by the University of Cambridge . and University College London has found that patients with rarer cancers . affecting the throat wait the longest. They asked 14,320 cancer patients how long they had waited after first noticing troublesome symptoms before seeing their GP. An implant made from curry powder could help beat breast cancer. Curcumin, the spice used to make turmeric, has known anti-cancer properties. But eating curry does not help, as the spice gets broken down in the stomach. Scientists at the University of Louisville,  Kentucky, have now tackled the problem by packing the powder inside 2mm-long dissolving capsules. They found the capsules shrank tumours in mice by about a third and slowed the rate at which rogue cells reproduced. The average time was ten days rising to 22 days for patients with oesophageal cancer and 30 days for oropharyngeal cancer – both affect the throat. Women were on average 10 per cent less likely to wait around than men, who are notoriously reluctant to seek medical help. Sara Hiom, from Cancer Research UK, which commissioned the research, said: ‘Some symptoms are more obvious than others so the important thing is to get to know your own body and what’s normal for you. ‘When cancer is diagnosed earlier, treatment is usually more effective and the chances of beating the disease are higher.’ The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, found the over 75s were 80 per cent more likely to see their doctor promptly than younger patients, suggesting they are more alert to the symptoms. And those with more common cancers tended to seek help more quickly. The average time was a week for breast cancer patients and six days for prostate cancers. The shortest time was for bladder cancer – two days – and kidney cancer – three. The symptoms for these two tumours are very alarming – blood in the urine – which would explain why patients do not wait around. Professor Jane Wardle, of University College London, said: ‘These findings suggest that lack of knowledge about symptoms may play a significant role in any delay in going to get checked out with the doctor for oropharyngeal and oesophageal cancer.’ In 2011 researchers at King’s College London warned that patients were being too stoical about cancer symptoms, with two thirds waiting at least a week before making an appointment.","Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe .

"By . Martyn Halle . A revolutionary breast implant - the lightest ever created - is due to be introduced in Britain later this year . A revolutionary new breast implant – the lightest ever created – is due to be introduced in Britain later this year. The new implants, called B-Lite, will weigh 30 per cent less than any others on the market – and are designed to avoid the kind of sagging that can occur after time with conventional cosmetic breasts. Up to now, implants have been made of weighty silicon gel or a saline water solution. The new type consists of a silicone shell filled with minute balls of silicate, a solid form of silicone gel, but much lighter. Inventor . Dael Govrin, an Israeli biochemical engineer, said: ‘Breast implants . haven’t got any lighter in weight since they were first introduced in . 1962. There has been no change in what goes into an implant since day . one. ‘We know that . after ten or  15 years, these implants will need replacing. When you put . an implant in, it is a dead weight. That’s why they start to sag after a . number of years and why women get through two or three sets if they . want to maintain good-looking breasts. ‘We think it is important to make an implant as light as possible.’ The . average conventional implant weighs just over 1lb, while the average . real breast is slightly lighter than that. The new implant weighs a . third less than than the conventional type. Nearly 40 Israeli women have already been fitted with the  new breasts and say they hardly notice they are there. Mr Govrin was challenged to create the new implants by his brother Jacky, an Israeli plastic surgeon. Dael Govrin said: ‘The feedback from our first patients is extremely positive. Some of the women are having implants for the first time and they say they are lighter than their own natural breasts. ‘The breast still move naturally – from side to side – as they would if you saw a young woman on a beach walking along in a bikini. ‘Any lighter and they would have taken off. And that wouldn’t have been natural.’ Light touch: Surgeon Jacky Govrin created a breast 'like a young woman's on a beach' Mayaan Peled, 27, from Tel Aviv, who has had the surgery, said:  ‘My boobs were sagging because I had lost an enormous amount of weight. The only things that sagged  after shedding 40 kilos [88lb] were my boobs. ‘The result of the surgery is fantastic. I don’t feel as if my breasts are there. They are fuller than before but not as heavy and I’m still wearing the same-size bra.’ The new implants have been given European ‘CE Mark’ approval. Surgeon Christopher Inglefield  of the London Bridge Plastic Surgery And Aesthetic Centre hopes to start a trial this summer at his Marylebone practice.","B-Lite implants, to be introduced in Britain later this year, will weigh 30 per cent less than any others on the market .

"By . Toni Jones . If you were stuck in a rut in the bedroom who would you turn to for advice? A best friend? A therapist? Homer Simpson? One cheeky cartoonist has decided Springfield's slobbiest resident is in fact the love machine that the rest of us need to be taking sexytime advice from. And sorry Marge, but you have been replaced in his affections with a cartoon version of ice queen Anna Wintour. The fearsome Vogue editor (complete with signature bob and black sunglasses) and a Y-front wearing Homer appear in a series of risque drawings by Italian cartoonist aleXsandro Palombo in his latest satirical blog entry. Italian illustrator aleXsandro Palombo has created a series of sketches offering erotic advice featuring Anna Wintour and Homer Simpson . Titled 'Illustrated Erotic Advice with Homer Simpson and Vogue Editrix Anna Wintour' the work features pictures of the semi-clad cartoon characters showcasing various forms of sexual kinks including role play, submission and even foot fetishism. Artist aleXsandro was previously a knitwear designer, showing his collections . at Milan Fashion Week, but the illustrator is now better known as a subversive force . via his blog Humor Chic. He describes the blog as a daily society portrait: 'The best illustrated fashion chronicle, a point of view about costume, politics, culture, society and celebrity,' and describes himself as 'the father of Fashion Satire, visionary artist, author and critic.' Talking about his latest work he . said: 'Homer Simpson is the perfect embodiment of the average man today . with all his frustrations, desires and weaknesses. He is also The Male . Chauvinist. Similarly, Anna Wintour is the embodiment of the liberated . women, a woman of power. She represents the ideal feminist. 'They are the two opposites of the . same coin and represent a good part of the society in which we live. That's why I thought they were two figures of interest to interpret this . role playing game. Both are definitely having fun.' The risque images feature the fearsome fashion editor and the slobby Simpsons character in a variety of poses aimed at helping couples stuck in a rut . The artist who used to be a fashion designer now runs a satirical blog poking fun at famous fashionistas . On the blog aleXsandro says: 'When I put pencil to paper, I know where I'll start but I don't know where I'll finish. 'My . panels are like a performance and not a copy of real life. Every . character wears a creation of mine, my personal vision of style.' It will be interesting to know what fashion queen Anna makes of his 'personal vision of style' as she is depicted in various rather lewd positions wearing little more than thigh-high boots and bunny ears. And this isn't the first time that the illustrator has used Anna as a reference in his work, previously he has imagined her and several of her high-flying designer friends in the style of . Matt Groening's favourite family from Springfield. AleXsandro also transformed the fashion pack, including Karl Lagerfeld, Alber Elbaz, Marc Jacobs and curator Diane . Pernet, in to bright blue smurfs in celebration of the Belgian comic and . television sensation of 1958.

"By . Bianca London . David Cameron announced on Tuesday . that every householder connected to the internet will have their access to . online porn blocked unless they ask to receive it. And while many people are heralding the 'opt-in' porn restrictions as a success, Dr Brooke Magnanti- research scientist, and writer, who, until her identity was revealed in November 2009, was known by the pen name Belle de Jour - has shed some interesting light on the new development. Writing on The Telegraph, she said: 'One big assumption seems to be that only blokes will opt-in to porn, because the widespread myth is that only men watch it. But women seek out hardcore content too.' Belle De Jour writer Dr Brooke Magnanti says Cameron's internet porn 'opt-in' system won't stop women watching sex online . She goes on to explain that women don't just seek hardcore content in erotic fiction such as Fifty Shades Of Grey but also online. She revealed that Google search terms such as 'porn,' and 'Playboy' are more likely to be entered by men than by women, however, generic words such as 'sex,' are equally as likely to be entered by women and they are actually more likely to type 'adult sex,' 'free sex,' and 'cyber sex' than men are. She maintains that the searches demonstrate the extent to which the internet has helped remove stigma for women who seek out porn. 'The fact that women are porn consumers too is not something you hear a lot about - you're far more likely to hear shock stats about the number of 12 year-olds looking at porn than adult women, even though the latter category hugely outnumbers the former,' she adds. Dr Brooke Magnanti - research scientist, and writer, who, until her identity was revealed in November 2009, was known by the pen name Belle de Jour- found that many women watch porn online, too . Dr Magnanti was writing in response to David Cameron's unveiling of a raft of reforms to shield children from 'poisonous' websites that are 'corroding childhood'. By the end of next year, all 19million . UK homes currently connected to the net will be contacted by service . providers and told they must say whether family-friendly filters that . block all porn sites should be switched on or off. From the end of this year, all new . customers setting up a broadband account or switching provider will have . the filters automatically switched on unless they opt to disable them . to allow sites with ‘adult content’. But Dr Magnanti outlines her concern that the new regulations conflate 'the adult and consensual with the obviously deviant and criminal'. In light of the news. she concludes: 'And for the silent majority out there of women who have watched porn and probably would do so again, will this herald a surge in signups to private browsing services? Possibly. 'But my guess is that lots of ladies will simply go back to that old faithful, lo-fi option: the paperback rack.' Prime Minister David . Cameron announced new rules requiring every . internet connection to have porn blocked unless subscribers 'opt in' to . obscene content .","Says people assume it's just men who watch porn but women seek it too .

"By . Bianca London . When it comes to finding the right bra, even the most proficient shoppers often despair. With so many options on the market in differing shapes, styles and sizes, and fitting services rather hit and miss, it comes as no surprise that a recent study found that 85 per cent of women are wearing the wrong size bras. But a new app - researched by a NASA scientist - claims to solve the problem once and for all by calculating a woman's bra size all in the flash of an iPhone. ThirdLove promises to give women accurate bra measurements by measuring their diameters when they take two selfies- and then directs you to their store to buy one . ThirdLove, a start-up app that has already raised $5.6m (£3.61m) from investors, works by taking two pictures of a user wearing a tight vest top. The app then renders three-dimensional data from the two-dimensional photos you have snapped of yourself and calculates your precise measurements. Featuring a female's tutorial voice, the app then suggest bras and underwear that you should buy (from their own store) which they claim should fit you like a glove. The app was founded by Dave Spector, a former partner at Sequoia Capital, and Ara Nefian, a senior scientist with the Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames Research Center, is also involved. Ara Nefian explained the technicalities behind the app to Fastcompany.com saying that the back end 'involves several methods of advanced computer vision, body modelling, and machine learning'. The tool is able to estimate the parameters of the camera, making the iPhone a calibration object. With 85 per cent of women in the UK wearing the wrong bra size, the new app- which was research by a NASA scientist- wants to change that . When it has calculated those parameters, it is then possible to accurately give predicted measurements of a 3-D object - in the case of this app the human body - using 2-D images. ThirdLove already has big plans for the future and eventually wants to expand its intelligent fitting service to encompass other types of clothing. A Communications executive at the NASA Ames Research Center contacted Fastcompany.com to reiterate that Ara Nefian is a contracted researcher and that 'No NASA software, technology, equipment or facilities were used in Mr. Nefian's consulting to Third Love.'","ThirdLove promises to give women accurate bra measurements .

"By . Annabel Grossman . Thousands of women could benefit from a new fertility treatment designed to help those with low body fat to start a family without IVF. The hormonal treatment is aimed at fitness fanatics who struggle with infertility due to their ultra-active lifestyles. It could also help female athletes who are forced to take a break from training if they want to try for a baby. Active: The new hormonal treatment is aimed at fitness fanatics who struggle with infertility (file picture) But critics fear it could encourage women who are dangerously underweight or anorexic to start a pregnancy they cannot healthily maintain. Hypothalamic amenorrhoea – which affects one in 100 women but one in ten female athletes, ballerinas and gymnasts – occurs among women who have lost a large amount of body fat due to dieting or intensive exercise. Energy is diverted away from maintaining the reproductive system so periods stop and women are unable to conceive naturally. The new treatment involves injecting the hormone kisspeptin to kick-start the reproductive process without the need to take a break from exercise. Costly: The treatment involves injecting the hormone kisspeptin to kick-start the reproductive process without the need to take a break from exercise.

It could provide an attractive and less costly alternative to IVF.’ But although welcoming the research, a Society for Endocrinology spokesman warned of possible risks. ‘Women who exercise intensely stop their periods for a good reason: their bodies are not ready for the huge amount of energy needed to take an embryo through a pregnancy to a healthy baby without stealing energy stores from the mother. ‘If this technique was used in women with anorexia they could conceive, but we don’t know how well the baby would develop or if it would harm the mother.’","Treatment designed to help women with low body fat to start a family .

It's a rave, yes, but not as you know them. This is not an after-party. These people have not dragged their weary selves from a club to an underground bunker in which to continue their slcohol-soaked merriment. These people are stone-cold sober, have just woken up and are about to go to work. Welcome to the world of early morning raving. Welcome to Morning Glory. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Morning Glory partygoers dance to music by The Loose Cannons from 6am in Shoreditch... before going to work . Wake up.... stretch.... put your trainers on.... head to Morning Glory for a pre-breakfast rave before going to work . The premise of the monthly event - whose subhead is 'rave your way into the day' - is to turn clubbing on its head and allow music fiends to embrace beats and bass without alcohol, and to rev themselves up for the day through dancing. DJ Marcus Veda, who provided the soundtrack to the event at Village Underground as The Loose Cannons with his DJ partner Julien Davis, told MailOnline: 'We came straight from playing at Secret Garden Party festival and the energy in the club was the same as it had been there. People were so energised. A lot of people were really getting their sweat on.' Marcus, who also takes rave to the yoga generation when he DJs for outdoor yoga classes in Covent Garden, added: 'Most people there were about to go to work, and some of them looked a bit bewildered at first, but then everyone really started getting into the music. 'It's clubbing with a good, happy vibe, and none of that dark edge. People were genuinely happy.' The view from behind the DJ booth at Morning Glory held in east London . Organisers hope to make the event a weekly occurrence, and The Loose Cannons hope to be asked back. 'It was free-form exercise. It came from the idea that people go to aerobics or the gym in the morning, and this is like that without it being structured. 'It's like clubbing, but instead of crawling out into the darkness afterwards feeling horrible, you go to work feeling great. And instead of having a beer you have coffee, a croissant and a massage.' The next drop-in event is scheduled for 4 September. Is an early-morning rave exactly what you need to feel energised in the morning?","Morning Glory early-morning clubbing in east London .

But one of the world's biggest fashion names chose to give proceedings a miss - in favour of attending a film screening. Vogue editor Anna Wintour joined Colin Firth's eco-warrior wife Livia and Karl Lagerfeld's former muse Amanda Harlech for the premiere of environmental fashion film Handprint at the W London hotel in Leicester Square. Eco-fashionistas: Anna Wintour (centre right) with Livia Firth, Amanda Harlech and director Mary Nighy . Glamorous greens: Livia Firth owns Eco Age while Anna Wintour turned out to support new film Handprint . The film, which was directed by Mary Nighy and stars American actress and model Elettra Wiedemann, aims to promote awareness of the conditions endured by third world garment workers. Clothing factories in countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Cambodia are used by numerous high street and designer names, and until recently, many were also reported to use child labour. The squalid conditions faced by workers made headlines earlier this year, when eight-storey garment factory Rana Plaza in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, collapsed, killing 1,129 people and injuring more than 2,500. Others involved in making Handprint included Net-a-Porter founder, Natalie Massanet, and Caroline Rush, chairman of the British Fashion Council. Passion: Amanda Harlech will be going to the JW Andersen show while Mary Nighy (above) directed Handprint . Wintour, resplendent in a classic trench coat with bright yellow cuffs, appeared to enjoy the short film, although it seems the British weather failed to meet with her approval. 'I enjoyed the film and felt proud of . the accomplishment of Mary (Nighy),' said the Vogue supremo, before adding: 'Despite the rain I am . enjoying London so far.' While the eco film was the main topic of post-screening conversation, Amanda Harlech was overheard discussing her daughter Tallulah's career prospects, telling friends she hoped she would become an actress. And despite her passion for fashion, Harlech, who wore a typically chic Dior Homme jacket, a Prada jumper and . a Balenciaga dress, said she would be missing fashion week this time - with the exception of hotly tipped Northern Irish designer JW Anderson.

"By . Bianca London . Pawnbrokers in Hong Kong are offering cash-strapped customers loans in exchange for their designer handbags. Expensive arm candy often retains its retail value so companies feel safe using them as collateral for debts. Cash-poor clients - whose money is tied up in savings or the stock market - are generally allowed to borrow 80 per cent of their bag's value. Customers are expected to pay back their loan within four months with four per cent added monthly interest. Once the debt is cleared they are given their handbag back. Designer arm candy, such as Chanel and Louis Vuitton, often retains its retail value so companies feel safe using the bags as collateral on loans . The Wall Street Journal reports that the Yes Lady Finance Co., one of the companies that offers the scheme, will approve a loan within half an hour - as long the handbag is Gucci, Chanel, Hermès or Louis Vuitton. Those with special edition or vintage versions of the 'big four' designers will even get better loan leverage. And it's not just women - one in five customers are men.

However, he may yet be on the move despite this injury setback, with Valencia very keen on striking a deal with City, although they would have to cough up a reported £25million to land the experienced forward. Manuel Pellegrini's side started the season in positive vein with a 2-0 win at Newcastle, with Liverpool their next opponents in a repeat of last season's top two at the Etihad on Monday night.","Negredo was joined by friends and family as well as his City team-mates to celebrate his birthday .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Sharon Villette lost more than 12 pints of blood when son Liam (pictured) was born two months early . A  mother-of-two was left close to death after losing more than 12 pints of blood during a traumatic premature delivery. Sharon Villette, 36, haemorrhaged during an emergency Caesarean section due to placenta accreta, a condition which affects just one in 2,500 pregnancies. It occurs when the placenta attaches itself to scar tissue left from a previous operation. Mrs Villette, of Colchester, required seven litres of blood and her family was warned that she and her baby son Liam might not survive the delivery. But two years on, he has developed into a perfectly healthy toddler despite being born more than two months premature. Mrs Villette said: 'I was in hospital for a checkup and had popped to the loo when I experienced major bleeding. The next thing I knew, I was being prepared for surgery. 'My husband was warned I might not wake up. It was a complete whirlwind. 'Five hours later I came round, having had the Caesarean. My son had been taken to a different hospital and I was utterly disorientated.' After first experiencing heavy bleeding during the 18th week of her pregnancy, doctors at Colchester General Hospital told Mrs Villette she had placenta praevia - otherwise known as low-lying placenta - which occurs in around one in 200 pregnancies. She said: 'They monitored the baby’s heartbeat and thankfully everything seemed fine. I was told to go home and be very careful. 'If I started bleeding again, I had to go back into hospital immediately. 'One morning, while I was 26 weeks pregnant, I started bleeding heavily as I was getting my daughter ready for school. Baby Liam was rushed to the neotnatal unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Doctors had warned he might not survive his mother's labour . Mrs Villette had been suffering from placenta accreta, a condition which affects just one in 2,500 pregnancies. It occurs when the placenta attaches itself to scar tissue left from a previous operation . 'I decided to go into hospital and it was very lucky I did. The bleeding got worse when I went to the toilet. I pulled the emergency cord and suddenly I was surrounded by medical staff.' Her husband Andrew, 48, a bricklayer, was called in to be by her side and she was prepped for an emergency Caesarean section under general anesthetic. Mrs Villette, a secondary school learning support worker, said: 'The doctors warned my family after I had been sedated that I was in a very serious situation. If they couldn’t control the bleeding, then both I and the baby would have been lost.' During the delivery doctors battled to stabilise her, giving her more than 12 pints of blood over two hours. When she woke, five hours after being sedated, she was weak - and discovered Liam, who had been born weighing just 2lb 2oz, had been rushed to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge for specialised care. Mrs Villette (with daughter Jessica) and Liam when he was five days old. She was so weak after the birth that she did see him until he was a few days old . But two years on, Liam has developed into a perfectly healthy toddler despite his traumatic start to life . Doctors later explained to Mrs Villette that her placenta had attached itself to scar tissue left over from the Cesarean section delivery of her daughter Jessica, now six - a far rarer condition called placenta accreta. The condition, which occurs in around one in 2,500 pregnancies, can cause serious complications and, as in Mrs Villette’s case, often requires a hysterectomy. he said: 'I know that for some people, having a hysterectomy for medical reasons can leave regret hanging over them, but not us. We don’t want any more children - we are content with the family we have.' She added: 'I’d had a Caesarean with Jessica because she’d had a breech birth. Somehow, Liam’s placenta had become attached to the scar tissue. 'It explained the regular bleeding. Every time Liam had moved in my womb, the lining had been seriously damaged.' Mrs Villette needed a hysterectomy after Liam's birth but says with him and daughter Jessica, her family is now complete . In the end, she didn't see him until he was five days old, when she was strong enough to leave hospital and travel to the  neonatal unit at Addenbrooke’s. She said: 'I felt very protective over him. Until then, I’d been disorientated and overwhelmed, but to see him in the ward with all the other premature children was a very emotional experience.' Having turned two in February, Liam is hitting developmental milestones on schedule, despite his precarious start in life. Mrs Villette said: 'Jessica loves to help with him. They’re extremely close. I’m aware that the experience affected the family more than it did me. 'From my perspective, I went to sleep and woke up following the delivery not feeling very well. But my family was told that they might lose me and the baby. I’m glad I didn’t have to go through that stress. 'We are now looking to the future. Liam is a little boy who needs all the love and care we can give him, and we are ready to move on in life.' Having turned two in February, Liam (with sister Jessica and father Andrew) is hitting developmental milestones on schedule, despite his precarious start in life .","Sharon Villette, 36, haemorrhaged during an emergency Caesarean section .

"By . Sara Malm . An eight-year-old girl who was diagnosed with terminal cancer, has become the first person in the world to overcome her illness. Claudia Burkill, from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, had been battling metastatic pineoblastoma since the age of five, and her parents were told on several occasions she only had weeks left. However, parents Andrea and David were told the good news this weekend - exactly three years to the day since Mrs Burkill first phoned a hospital about her daughter's health. Smiling again: Claudia, aged eight, pictured with her mother Andrea Burkill, is the first person in the world to beat deadly cancer metastatic pineoblastoma . Long journey: Claudia, pictured now and before the cancer struck, was diagnosed at the age of five . Metastatic pineoblastoma is an extremely rare form of cancer and has a survival rate of less than five per cent worldwide. Claudia underwent an experimental Italian treatment at Nottingham Children’s Hospital, involving 44 gruelling sessions of radiotherapy. Writing on her daughter's Facebook page 'Claudia's Cause' this weekend, Mrs Burkill said: ‘Claudia is cancer-free and no longer classed as terminally ill. ‘A miracle has happened, it really has. I just can't stop shaking.’ Doctors only see three or four cases of metastatic pineoblastoma a year of the condition for which there is still no known cure. Claudia first became ill in June 2011 when the family returned after a holiday and she began vomiting. Happy family: Claudia with siblings, Zachery, Abigail and Esme and their father David . Against the odds: Claudia's parents were told several times during the years of battling the brain cancer that their daughter only had weeks to live . Saved: Mrs Burkill wrote that she 'could not stop shaking' after doctors found Claudia to be completely cancer free this weekend and no longer terminally ill . After first being told she had a virus, a second visit to Lincoln County Hospital and several tests, including a CT-scan, a lumbar puncture and an MRI, saw doctors diagnose her with a squint. Mrs . Burkill was not satisfied with the diagnosis and after having Claudia . transferred to Queens Medical Centre Nottingham, the lethal tumour was . found at the centre of her brain. Over the following years, Mr and Mrs Burkill were told on four occasions that Claudia only had weeks to live and they had to start planning her funeral. She is now no longer terminally ill and the latest MRI scan showed that Claudia is in the clear. Although she has suffered some brain damage from the treatment, her family are positive that her health will continue to improve. True fighter: Eight-year-old Claudia underwent an experimental Italian treatment at Nottingham Children¿s Hospital, involving 44 gruelling sessions of radiotherapy, before the cancer was gone . Mrs Burkill said: ‘We had lived with a terminal diagnosis with death believed to be imminent for a crazy 694 days. ‘Today . is the very first day in a very long time that I can look into the eyes . of our four stunning children and “know” that I don't have to plan the . funeral of one of them in the very near future.' She added: ‘Today is our first day of freedom, a freedom so far lost and forgotten. ‘The mere joy of being alive today far surpasses any other single day in my live so far. ‘There are no signs of any tumour, any leptomeningeal spread or any recurrent disease, anywhere. ‘We are the luckiest people in this world - Claudia is believed to be the very first little girl in the world ever to survive metastatic pineoblastoma. ‘She has paid a high price, we all have, however, she does have her life and we are dedicated to making the very best that it can be for her. ‘A life where she can experience love, joy and happiness in abundance and be cherished always.’","Claudia Burkill was diagnosed with metastatic pineoblastoma aged five .

"By . Katy Winter . Former Disney pop princess Miley Cyrus caused an uproar when she took to the stage at this year's Video Music Awards wearing a flesh-coloured latex bikini and performing a seriously overtly sexual dance routine. The 20-year-old's bottom shaking and grinding may not have won her many accolades in the music community, but a few savvy fitness fanatics realised that ‘twerking’ is a great way to tone up and burn calories. The ‘twerking’ dance, which has even been honored with an official entry in the Oxford Dictionaries Online, essentially involves adopting a traditional gym squat position and maintaining it while vigorously shaking the derriere. Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke's performance of 'Blurred Lines' at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards (left) has inspired many to adapt the 'twerking' dance as a work-out (right) Miley's risque VMA performance shocked many and made her the subject of much discussion last weekend . Whatever your thoughts on Miley's raunchy VMAs performance, there can be no doubt that her body is toned and lean . This dynamic combination of toning positions and cardio combined with Miley's enviable physique led to women becoming eager to try the ‘twerk’ for themselves. Les Mills, creator of fitness programmes including Bodypump, says it received a number of requests for a class featuring twerking moves following Miss Cyrus's controversial VMA performance. They adapted their existing Bodyjam class to incorporate a number of energetic twerking moves - to great effect. They have seen a surge of interest in the dance class and are considering changing the class's name to the Twerkout. Nicki Minaj and Ciara get in on the twerking trend . Rihanna gets in on the act with some twerk moves . Ice T's wife Coco Austin shows the hosts of talk show The Real how it's done . The 'twerkout' is rapidly gaining popularity as people jump on the chance to dance while toning up . Twerking has become a cultural sensation in recent years, and a YouTube search for 'twerking' brings up more than 3.8 million results with everything from pregnant women and dogs to babies and the elderly, with many celebrities like Nicki Minaj, Ciara and Rihanna also demonstrating their 'twerking' skills. Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes . To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward . To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone . Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section . For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out . Then up the tempo and shake the butt . Directions provided by HowCast . The new version developed by Les Mills incorporates the signature twerking steps including the 'shake', 'wobble' and 'jiggle'. While Robin Thicke won't be available for fitness fanatics to twerk against, the dance routines are choreographed to the latest chart hits… and instructors are fully trained to dodge amorous advances. In addition to burning 530 calories per 55 minute session, research by Les Mills also reveals twerkers could see on average an eight per cent increase in pelvic bone density with regular participation. Bone density is essential to avoiding osteoporosis in later life, meaning that twerking could help you avoid fractures or hip replacements in later life. Gandalf Archer, Les Mills International Programme Developer comments on the craze and development of the Bodyjam programme, saying: . 'We can't wait to get more people twerking their way to a better body.' Bodyjam Twerkout in action: The bootyshake is a key exercise for any aspiring twerker . Dave Kyle, Head Trainer for Les Mills, offers his top five tips to get your rear in gear Bodyjam style: . 1. Warm up with hip rolls, rotating your hips up, down, left and right, so your joints are suitably loosened for you to get your twerk on . 2. Squats and pulses (a 'bounce' mid repetition) are ideal to get your back end looking great. 3. The bootyshake is a key exercise for any aspiring twerker. Integral to the Bodyjam workout the aim is to shake your rear whilst keeping the rest of your body still – really working those glutes . 4. A signature move for Bodyjam, the 'tick tock' is an essential heel-toe grind to work up quads to rival Rihanna . 5. DON'T stick your tongue out. It didn't work for Miley and it won't work for you! Instead stick your bottom out at everyone opportunity, this pose will build your core to guarantee a whittled waist to set off your behind.","Miley Cyrus shocked many with her 'twerking' performance at the VMAs .

"By . Ruth Styles At London Fashion Week . It's rare to find a designer who sticks to her style guns through thick and thin but Emilia Wickstead isn't your average fashion creative. True to form, this was a collection carefully calibrated to appeal to the ladylike, the kitten of heeled and the violently allergic to London's wackier names. No wonder, then, that Wickstead counts the ever-elegant Samantha Cameron among her faithful fans and although the Prime Minister's wife didn't put in an appearance, she's very likely to put in an order or two. Scroll down for video . Stunning: A beautiful pink and orange striped silk gown on the catwalk at Emilia Wickstead . Ladylike: Buttercup yellow and pretty powder pink were combined to elegant effect at Emilia Wickstead . There was nothing here that could be considered wacky, outré or in bad taste: instead, what we got was a masterclass in stylish summer dressing. Granted, there was nothing particularly new about the silhouette, which with its neat bell skirt and nipped in waist said 1950s rather than now, although it was undeniably pretty. But newness isn't what Wickstead is really about: instead, she wants to make clothes that women really want to wear, whether they're Samantha Cameron or a mother-of-two from deepest Derbyshire. And wearable, Wickstead's thoroughly feminine collection was. Delicate flowing dresses lifted with stripes and bearing forgiving Empire waistlines. Bold hues: Wickstead plumped for vibrant shades of cornflower blue and buttercup yellow . Vintage: Wickstead stayed true to her flatteringly feminine style . Breezy: Boldly coloured striped gave the collection an airy feel . Elegant: A shirt dress that's bound to find favour at No. 10 . Neat skirt suits with bell-shaped skirts and beautifully tailored jackets.  A vibrant orange and pink striped dress with a 50's A-line skirt. And an utterly gorgeous lightweight tailored coat. Like the fabrics, colours were sumptuous with buttercup yellow, delicate blush pink, shimmering cornflower blue and vibrant crimson among the most eye-catching. There was the odd touch of print, a charmingly quirky piano motif, but nothing to scare the horses - it was playful Britishness at its best. All shimmered together beautifully, never breaking stride or indeed a sweat. No falls, no drama, no silliness. All was well in the world of Emilia Wickstead. Special thanks to Jaguar and Murray Chauffeur Service for driving the Femail team around during London Fashion Week.","Emilia Wickstead is famous for her flatteringly feminine designs .
