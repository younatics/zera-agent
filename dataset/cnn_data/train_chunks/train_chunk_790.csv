"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Headed into the family business: Ted Kennedy Jr, who is a healthcare lawyer, is expected to announce his run for the Connecticut state senate . Ted Kennedy Jr. is planning to run for the state Senate in Connecticut in his first bid for public office, choosing a state-level post as his first target rather than national office. The son of late Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts has not officially announced his bid to enter public life but is expected to make it official this evening at a library in Branford. He reportedly intends to seek the Democratic nomination for the 12th Senatorial District, according to two people said on condition of anonymity because Kennedy wants to make the announcement. Kennedy is 52-year-old health care lawyer who lives in Branford, a coastal town near New Haven, and has been mentioned as a possible political candidate for some time. He said last month he was considering running for the seat. As a member of one of America's most prominent political families, Kennedy Jr. has been floated over the years as a possible candidate for various political offices, including U.S. Senate seats in Connecticut and Massachusetts, but he has declined to run. He has campaigned on behalf of Democratic politicians from the state, including U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, and for President Barack Obama. His brother, former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, represented Rhode Island for 16 years until he retired in 2011. Part of the family: Ted Kennedy Jr (far left) is the eldest son of the former Senator Ted Kennedy (second from right) and brother of former Congressman Patrick Kenned (to the left of their father), all seen together in 1994 . Patrick Kennedy would not comment when asked to confirm whether his older brother planned to run, saying it was up to him to announce. But he said they had discussed it. 'Obviously, in our family we talk a lot about politics and public life,' he said. 'He's pretty much gone a different route than me in not pursuing this in his life, although he had many opportunities to do it. It would be a natural extension of everything he has done.' The former congressman said he admired his brother for putting his family first for many years. Now, Ted Kennedy Jr.'s children are teenagers. Patrick Kennedy said his brother's life was transformed when as a boy he lost his leg to cancer. Entering the race: Ted Kennedy Jr's (left) foray into politics comes as little surprise considering his family ties (seen in this undated photo with his father, cousin Robert Kennedy Jr, and brother then-Congressman Patrick Kennedy) Tragic: Ted Kennedy Jr spoke (left) at his father's 2009 funeral, and was greeted by his brother (right) after . Describing him with the phrase that was the title of a book by their uncle and former President John F. Kennedy, Patrick Kennedy said his brother became a 'profile in courage': surviving a deadly cancer, having his leg amputated and later becoming a champion for people with disabilities. 'I've always thought my brother could be a really powerful leader, I'm not just talking elected-office sense, but leadership sense,' he said. 'He's just got such a tremendous personal story. I've always thought he'd be a very compelling political figure because he's integrated work with public policy with his own personal experience.' Their father took office in the Senate when he was 30 and served for nearly five decades. Video Source YouTube . Liberal leanings: The Kennedy family have long been important supporters of Barack Obama, (Ted Jr, Patrick and their mother Vicki seen here with him in October 2009 after the Senator's death) Patrick Kennedy added that if Kennedy Jr. does decide to run, he'll get plenty of support from the Kennedy clan. 'I haven't succeeded in getting him to take that plunge, but if he does, like everyone who knows him well, we're going to be very enthusiastic in our efforts on his behalf,' he said. The 12th District is represented by Guilford Democrat Edward Meyer, who is retiring. The seat represents Branford, Durham, Guilford, Killingworth, Madison and North Branford. There are no declared candidates yet in the race. 'We have several quality candidates who are interested in running and we intend to vigorously contest this open seat, regardless of the Democratic candidate,' state Republican Party Chairman Jerry Labriola Jr. said last month, adding that the district is 'trending Republican' and 'it's hard to imagine that the voters would choose to move farther to the left of Ed.'","The late Senator Ted Kennedy's elder son is expected to announce his bid to become a Connecticut state Senator .

The mother of Mark Duggan, whose death sparked riots after he was shot dead by police, has been given permission to challenge the inquest ruling that he was lawfully killed.

"By . Lydia Warren . Accused: Thortsen Rushing, 18, allegedly shot his father and younger brother in their home . An 18-year-old high school senior accused of murdering his father and younger brother carried out the killings to get survivor benefits, court records suggest. A tearful Thorsten Rushing had initially claimed that he saw two masked intruders shoot dead his father, Uwe Rushing, and 14-year-old brother Stefan at their home in Lawton, Oklahoma in January before scaring them away by grabbing a shotgun and firing. But his story quickly unraveled when investigators realized the trajectory of the bullets did not match his story and three of his four alleged accomplices - his school friends - confessed to the plot. A week after the January 20 killings, Thorsten Rushing was arrested on murder and conspiracy charges, but authorities have never released a motive. Now a subpoena filed in the case has suggested that Rushing, who had recently turned 18, could have been trying to get his hands on a life insurance payout, The Oklahoman reported. In February, Comanche County Assistant . District Attorney Mark Stoneman asked for records relating to . Uwe Rushing's job at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, . specifically 'all documents related to survivor benefits', the publication reported. Victims: Uwe Rushing, left, was shot twice and 14-year-old Stefan was shot three times and suffocated . Gunned down: Thortsen Rushing is pictured right with his therapist father and younger brother . Thorsten Rushing . and four co-defendants - Ethan Thompson, 19, Wesley Bankston, 18, Cody . Davis, 19, and Timothy Delahoy, 18 - are to attend preliminary hearings this month. Rushing's is scheduled for Wednesday. He allegedly carried out the killings on January 20 before calling 911 at 2.35am, claiming he was sleeping in the living room when two men broke in and started shooting, killing his dad and brother. The brothers' mother, who had struggled with a drug problem, did not live at the home and had reportedly not had contact with her sons for nine years. Autopsy reports said Stefan Rushing was . shot three times in the head and face and then suffocated when he didn't bleed to death fast enough, police said. Their 50-year-old father died of gunshots to the chest and head, the autopsy found. Arrested: 19-year-old Ethan Thompson, left, allegedly hid in the closet for hours until after the shooting and then drove the murder weapon from the scene with 18-year-old Wesley Bankston, right . 'Plot': Timothy Delahoy, left, and Cody Davis, right, had allegedly been part of an earlier attempt to kill the father and younger brother three days prior but after it failed, they both backed out . Police said they believe Rushing was the only one who pulled the trigger but that Thompson, Davis and Delahoy confessed to . their involvement in the plot. Thompson allegedly hid in a closet for . hours until after the shooting, while Bankston allegedly drove Thompson . and the murder weapon from the scene - which led to their first-degree murder charges. Three days before the murder, Davis had donned a black hooded sweater to break in - but Uwe Rushing saw him as he went outside and pulled out a pistol, scaring the man away. Davis was allegedly going to take the gun from Thorsten Rushing after he shot his family before driving away with Delahoy, but after the scare, both men backed out, authorities said. Instead, Thortsen and two of his friends carried out the plan three days later, police said. Scene: Thorsten Rushing had claimed he was sleeping in the living room when two men broke in and opened fire, killing his father and brother. He said he scared them off after grabbing a shotgun . All of the men are charged . with two counts of conspiracy. Thompson and Bankston face . two counts of first-degree murder, while Davis and Delahoy face two counts . of being an accessory after the fact. The arrests shocked the comfortable town perched between Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City and came after a week of arduous detective work from the Lawton Police Department. 'From what we understand, they were smart kids,' Lawson police Captain Captain Craig Akard told KSWO after the arrests. 'They were polite kids.' Stephen Jones, an attorney representing Thorsten Rushing, said his client will be entering a plea of not guilty.","Thorsten Rushing 'shot dead his dad Uwe, 50, and shot and suffocated his brother Stefan in their Oklahoma home in January'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Parents and teachers are rallying around a California high school wrestling coach put on leave after video emerged of him  using wrestling moves to try to subdue a male student. Mark Black had been teaching his science class when it allegedly came to his attention that the unnamed student had drugs in his possession. A confrontation ensued and video shows what happened thereafter, but what seems like a case of a teacher going too far has some of Black's colleagues cheering him on. Scroll down for video . Shocking? A shocking physical altercation between student and teacher was caught on a cell phone camera Friday . In the few days since Black's story came to light, a Facebook page called 'We Support Coach Black of Samohi' has received close to 12,000 'likes.' One supporter, who identified himself on Facebook as former Santa Monica-Malibu District administrator Steve Martinez, wrote that Black did the right thing. 'If you had a child in this class and another student was selling . drug[s] in clear view, you would want any teacher to do what Mark Black . did,' Martinez wrote. 'He did in fact try . to resolve this situation peacefully by asking the student to turn over . the drugs to him. The student resisted and became aggressive … Support . this great teacher and wonderful person. He needs us at this time.' A former student also wrote in to support Black, the Los Angeles Times reported. 'You should all know that I lost my father when I was quite young,' the student wrote. 'Black . has been like a second father to me, just as he has to hundreds of other . kids throughout the years. He's kept kids off the streets, gotten . others into college, and shaped the lives of so many others throughout . his long service to this community. When you continue to hear about this . story, and hear people try to defend the student or attack Coach Black, . I beg of you to speak out against their false accusations.' In a letter sent to parents Friday by Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Superintendent Sandra Lyon initially argued that the well-regarded wrestling coach and teacher crossed a line. 'We really don't want teachers putting their hands on other students,' she wrote, calling the 'physical restraint' he used 'unacceptable.' At the heart of the confrontation was the student's alleged marijuana possession. 'The little boy was selling drugs in class,' student Kylan Townsend told KTLA. 'The wrestling coach told him to stop...I guess he didn't listen and tables were thrown. They started fighting.' There were no punches thrown, no kicking, and no yelling during the altercation. However, Black was suspended even before an investigation was conducted. Lyon said that an automatic suspension before investigation was standard school policy and in no way meant that the outcome was predetermined. Lyon also later apologized for her initial remarks about Black, acknowledging to the that her statement showed 'pre-judgement' in  a letter sent out this weekend. 'There is also concern about my failure to address the conduct of one . or more students who were involved in the incident. In retrospect, I . understand how my statement has created these concerns,' Lyon said, the  Los Angeles Times reported. These . facts, paired with the student's alleged illegal activities have some . area students, teachers and parents flocking to Black's side. A . petition called Reinstate Mark Black at Santa Monica High School has . quickly appeared on Change.org with an accompanying Facebook page. Take down: The video shows Santa Monica High School wrestling coach and science teacher Mark Black using his moves to take down an unnamed student . The student is alleged to have had drugs in his possession. Supporters of Black's say the well-liked teacher was attempting to subdue him while waiting for authiroties . 'Mark Black, longtime science teacher and wrestling coach at Santa Monica High School, was attacked on the morning of April 4, 2014,' reads the petition. 'Mr. Black, a wrestling coach with over 30 years experience, placed the student in a restraint hold to stop the student from further attacking him.  This was in an effort to get the situation under control,' it goes on to explain. The Change.org page received nearly 2,000 signatures before the weekend was out and the Facebook page 'We support Coach Black of Samohi' had nearly 8,000 likes. 'Mark Black is an incredible man, coach, and mentor who has helped shape my son, and countless students, into incredible loving, responsible young adults,' wrote parent Tanja Elliott on the Change.org petition. On Friday, Lyon wrote: . 'As a parent, I know that we want our children to be safe at school. This is a fundamental expectation that I honor and respect. I am committed to ensure that any disciplinary action taken in this matter is based on facts, the law and all students’ right to a safe learning environment.' No punches were thrown, nor was there any kicking or yelling during the incident which got Black suspended before an investigation could take place .","Coach Mark Black is seen in a student's cell phone video wrestling the unnamed student to the ground in his science class .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Police have arrested two teenagers in the savage beating of 54-year-old . white man left in a coma after he got out of his car to check on a young black boy he accidentally hit. The two suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested in connection with the attack last week of beloved grandfather Steve Utash, . who was brutally beaten by an angry . mob in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood after David Harris, 10, ran in . front of his truck on a busy street. Detroit police say about a dozen vigilantes beat Utash Wednesday, even stealing his wallet before leaving him injuries severe enough to cause bleeding on the brain - he is still in a medically induced coma. News of the arrests came as donations passed the $100,000 mark on a webpage set up to raise money to pay for Utash's mounting hosptial bills. Loving father: Steve Utash pictured with daughter Mandi Marie Utash. He was brutally beaten by a gang of men in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood . Hoping and praying: A family member holds Steve Utash's hand as he is in a medically-induced coma at a local hospital . The two arrested are expected to be arraigned Monday or Tuesday, a police spokesperson told MailOnline. Expected charges were not immediately available. They were brought into custody Saturday morning by police without resistance from their homes with tips from the community, authorities told WXYZ. Community group Detroit 300 was seen in a WJBK report canvassing the neighborhood door to door with flyers and pleas for help tracking down the additional assailants. Detroit 300 joined police in saying there is no reason to suspect the attack was racially motivated. 'This is just an issue that happened, we're not going to put a racial component on it,' said one member of the . group. 'These sort of things could have happened whether it would have . been white on white, black on black, the fact of the matter is that it . was wrong and it shouldn't have happened. 'This unprovoked attack on Steve is just inexcusable.' News of the arrests was welcomed by a family member who spoke to WDIV. 'Happy, glad but now since the two dominos are going to fall, they're going to find out,' said brother-in-law Max Mohr. 'We want them all.' 'We want them all': Brother-in-law Mar Mohr says the family is happy arrests have been made, but this is only the beginning . Group of friends: Four individuals are shown . standing by the side of the road at left and Harris can be seen darting . head on into traffic at right . It also came as the family says a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for the uninsured man's medical bills has raked in more than $111,000 - the goal was $50,000. The family is grateful for the outpouring of generosity that has come from around the world. 'They're so appreciative that they don't really know how to take what the world is saying about this and their dad being the way he is,' Mohr added after saying that Utash's condition has not changed in days - there is still bleeding on his brain. The donations and arrests are good news for a family that has found it hard to come by in recent days, and come as community leaders are rallying around the family with calls to end the random violence that plagues the blighted city. 'We’re a predominantly black church and Mr. Utash is white, but love is universal,' Reverend Maurice Rudd said during his Sunday sermon, according to the Detroit Free-Press. 'There are no boundaries to love. Love crosses all racial barriers, all levels of class. 'There is something in the spirit in southeast Michigan,' he continued. 'The spirit of violence... has infected our people.' 'Why are we so angry? What's wrong with us?' Reverend Larry Simmons shouted to his church during a Sunday sermon, according to the paper. Simmons called on his flock to perform 'random acts of kindness' every day, and said 'we aren't going to be silent anymore... in the midst of all this anger.' Rev. David Alexander Bullock echoed his thoughts across town during his Sunday sermon. 'It’s the responsibility of the faith community to engage those who are blind, in this case, a mob of young men who don’t see clearly, who flew into a rage... we can't stand idly by, we have to engage them.' Loving husband: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr Utash, was beaten into a life-threatening coma after stopping to help a 10-year-old boy he hit with his pick-up truck in Detroit. His family say he has no insurance . He's going to survive: David Harris, 10, suffered a broken leg after running into traffic in the busy street . The calls came after another driver was beaten, this time to death, at a Detroit gas station. Utash himself was left for dead by the angry mob. 'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit. Security . footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of . shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed . down by Utash's vehicle. Utash, from suburban Roseville, . immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from . their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene. Police quickly ruled the incident an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained. But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation. Police . tell MailOnline that about a dozen young males attacked the married . father of three, beating him into a coma that he still hasn't woken from. Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified . Moment of impact: Mr Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street . On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit . Released from the hospital: Harris suffered only a broken leg, he has already been sent home . 'It’s not like he hit the kid on purpose and they were trying to get revenge,' daughter Felicia Utash told WXYZ. 'He literally just tried to stop and help the kid and people came out of nowhere and tried to kill him.' His son Joseph Utash hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime. 'I . think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s . been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same . company... they know he has money and they robbed him. 'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.' Police immediately dismissed the notion. 'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime,' Moreno told MailOnline. The . boy's father was arrested after a background check revealed he has an . active warrant, according to the Detroit Free-Press, but police declined to say if he would be charged in . connection with the beating. Mob rule: The angry mob that would soon mercilessly beat Utash begins gathering where the boy was struck . Devastated: Daughter Felicia Utash (right) insisted her father (left) was only trying to do the right thing . Witnesses said Utash immediately pulled over to check on Harris after hitting him. ‘David was laying right in front of the . driveway and he had blood coming out of his mouth,’ James Duston Jr., . the boy’s godfather told WXYZ.  He couldn’t move his body.’ The crowd ran towards the boy's screams and mercilessly beat Utash. ‘This little boy was screaming,’ a woman told the Free Press. ‘There was a lot of people that came out. It was crazy.’ All hell broke loose. ‘I think it lasted about one minute and . then they let him go,’ a bystander told WXYZ. ‘And then they jumped back . on him again and they did it about three times and finally someone was . trying to help the guy that got beat up.’ ‘He had the biggest gash on his head I . ever seen – he was bleeding from the mouth and he was unconscious when I . first got there,’ Debra Hughes told WWJ. Harris suffered a broken leg, he has since been released from a local hospital, Moreno said. A message left with the family seeking further comment has not yet been returned. Brutal: The unidentified driver was savagely beaten after stopping to check on the young boy he accidentally hit with while driving this pickup truck . ‘It was sad because I knew the guy was getting out of his car to try and see what damage he did,’ the witness added. ‘He got his,’ another witness to the beating told the Free Press. ‘He got beat up real bad.’Both the driver and the boy were taken to a local hospital. The boy’s family condemned the beating. ‘We don’t condone that at all,’ said Duston. ‘I told his mom and she just was like, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.’ Doctors are still trying to determine if Utash will need surgery to save his life.

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . Chancellor George Osborne has only made 40 per cent of cuts so far, but stronger economic growth could spare some future cuts . Britain has become overly dependent on tax revenues from the richest 1 per cent of workers and it would be a ‘risk’ to demand more from them, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned. Those whose salaries start at £150,000 now account for 27.5 per cent of all income tax paid, up from just 11 per cent in 1979. These contributions, from just 300,000 people, represent 7.5 per cent of total tax revenue – and the group also pay ‘a large fraction of VAT and capital taxes’. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has announced plans to soak the rich by raising the top rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000. But the IFS says it is very difficult to assess how workers would behave if tax rates changed – hinting that wealthy individuals could avoid tax or move abroad if the 50p rate returns. The think-tank said: ‘Increased concentration of revenues from fewer individuals is significant and increases the sensitivity of the Government’s overall revenue position to the incomes and tax-payment behaviour of these individuals.’ The IFS also condemned Labour’s plan to reintroduce the 10p tax rate for the low-paid, saying it would be ‘less well-targeted’ than the Coalition government’s increases to the threshold at which workers must pay basic-rate income tax. ‘It’s hard to find a coherent rationale for it,’ it added. Last year, Ed Miliband pledged to reintroduce the 10 per cent rate abolished by Gordon Brown in 2007 – funded by a mansion tax on houses worth more than £2million. The IFS said this policy would cost £7billion – more than Labour has set aside – and introduce ‘unnecessary complexity to the income tax system’. The intervention is the third time in recent weeks that the IFS has questioned Labour’s policies. Mr Balls claimed raising the top rate of tax could raise an extra £15billion by 2020, but the IFS said the best estimate was just £100million a year. How less than half of cuts have already been made . The IFS poured cold water on Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's call for further rises to £12,500 in the level at which workers start paying income tax. Further significant increases in personal allowance would be 'expensive and poorly targeted at helping the low paid', as one in six workers now pay no income tax and would therefore not benefit. Only 15 per cent of any further rises in the threshold level would go to workers in the bottom half of the earnings ladder, said the IFS. But the thinktank was even less complimentary about Labour's proposal to restore the 10p starting rate of income tax, saying that it was 'hard to find a coherent economic rationale' for the change. The plan would be 'if anything, less well targeted on the low paid and would add unnecessary complexity/ . The Shadow Chancellor has also pledged to run a surplus on day-to-day Government spending by 2020, in a bid to match George Osborne’s vow to run a surplus on total spending by 2018. The IFS confirmed that this would allow Mr Balls to spend or borrow up to £25billion a year more than the Tories. The experts also warned the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats that lifting the basic-rate threshold above £10,000 will do little to help the poor because two million have already been lifted out of the income tax system since 2010, as the personal allowance has been raised from £6,475 to £10,000. From April, the bottom 17 per cent of earners will pay no income tax at all. Any further increase to the tax allowance would cost £12billion, the IFS said – and only 15 per cent of the gains would go towards the poorest half of workers. The think-tank said the employee National Insurance contribution threshold should be raised above its current level of £7,956 instead. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘The Liberal Democrats are nothing other than incredibly proud of the tax cuts we have delivered in Government for ordinary people. 'This policy is about making work pay. The British people have made great sacrifices as we repair the economy after the mess Labour left it in. ‘That is why the Lib Dems are pushing for a further worker’s bonus of a £100 tax cut at the next Budget. People earning £12,500 or a little bit more, who will benefit most from this tax cut, don’t regard themselves as rich and neither do we.’ A Treasury spokesman added: ‘As the IFS say in their report today, the UK economy has gathered momentum and growth is now among the fastest in the developed world. ‘But, as they also say, the largest challenge for the Chancellor remains having to contend with the consequences of the Great Recession for the public finances and household incomes. ‘That is why it’s so important that we continue to work through the long-term plan that is delivering economic security for Britain’s hardworking people.’","Billions more will need to be found after the 2015 general election .

"By . Tim Shipman . Revealed: Britain had a role in the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, pictured . David Cameron pleaded with the Sikh community to forgive the Tories last night after an inquiry found the Thatcher government advised India on how to attack a Sikh temple. He ordered the inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood after papers released under the 30-year rule exposed the British role last month. It found that an SAS officer was sent to brief the Indian army in 1984 on launching a surprise special forces dawn raid against the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which had been seized by Sikh rebels. But the advice was ignored and Indira Gandhi’s government instead launched a frontal assault – codenamed Operation Blue Star - which became a massacre in which up to 3,000 people were killed. Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs the SAS advice had a ‘limited impact’ on the raid, which led to an official death toll of 575 and claims that 3,000 people . perished in the crossfire, and that there was ‘no record’ of the British . government receiving advance notice of the operation. He told MPs . the SAS assessment ‘made clear that a military operation should only be . put into effect as a last resort’ and recommended that any military . operation use ‘an element of surprise and the use of helicopter-borne . forces in the interest of reducing casualties and bringing about a swift . resolution’. But British Sikhs last night voiced concerns, demanding a full public inquiry. Dabinderjit Singh, of the Sikh Federation UK, said Britain’s involvement was clear, adding: ‘We are actually very disappointed with the announcement today.’ Mr Cameron said he wanted the dialogue between the Government and the Sikh community to continue, adding: ‘British Sikhs have made – and continue to make – a vital contribution to our national life. Alliance: David Cameron visited the temple last year, and Sikhs in Britain form a key bloc vote for the Tories . 'Thirty years ago, a great tragedy unfolded...in Amritsar. Many lives were lost and the scars in the Sikh community still run deep. ‘I tasked the Cabinet Secretary with getting to the truth. He did so, and there are two main findings. ‘One: around four months before the . events, at the request of the Indian Government, a single UK military . officer provided some advice. But critically, this advice was not . followed, and it was a one-off. Anger: Lord Indarjit Singh said Mr Hague's statement was 'smug and condescending' ‘Two: there is absolutely no evidence of UK Government involvement in the operation itself.’ The Prime Minister travelled to Amritsar last year to visit the temple - a trip that appeared to have led to a rise in Conservative support among British Sikhs, who are a key voting bloc in marginal constituencies in London and the Midlands. His efforts are seen by many to have been dashed by the new revelations. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said 'serious questions' remained, adding: ‘The pain and suffering still felt by many about the tragic events of 1984 places a particular duty on the Government to provide what answers it can to address very genuine concerns.’ Lord Indarjit Singh, director of the Network of Sikh Organisations, called Mr Hague’s statement ‘smug and condescending’ and said the language in the documents was ‘insulting’ to Sikhs since it suggested they were all extremists. On the claim that UK advice had a ‘limited impact’ of the Golden Temple attack, Lord Singh said: ‘It is like saying that I had only a minimal involvement in a massacre or a holocaust.’ Jasvir Singh, director of the City Sikhs Network, which represents Sikh professionals in the UK, said the information disclosed in the review ‘harks back to colonial times’. He added: ‘I think there are lots of people in the Sikh community who are upset that the British could be involved in this, even to a limited extent.’","Inquiry finds Britain advised India on attacking Golden Temple in Amritsar .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Two former Chris Christie appointees have met with federal prosecutors about the 'Bridgegate' fiasco, adding new fuel to the fire just weeks after a report commissioned by the New Jersey governor appeared to clear his name. Former Port Authority official David Wildstein and former Christie chief counsel Charlie McKenna have both begun the process of disentangling themselves from scandal swirling around the Republican governor, according to liberal bloggers at Esquire magazine and the online legal publication Main Justice. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, the New Jersey prosecutor who succeeded Christie in that office, has begun presenting evidence to a grand jury. Longtime Christie press secretary Michael Drewniak has been in and out of those proceedings. Wildstein put himself at the center of a plot to snarl traffic in a New Jersey town last September by giving the order to choke off traffic lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge – in apparent retaliation for a Democratic mayor's failure to endorse Christie's re-election bid. Scroll down for video . David Wildstein (C), former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Director of Interstate Capital Projects and an ally of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, is apparently baring his 'Bridgegate' soul to a federal prosecutor . Chris Christie, already parlaying his NJ governorship into a presidential trial balloon, is betting that a recent report clearing his name will withstand the scrutiny of Paul Fishman -- a tough US Attorney who got his old job when he moved to the state capitol . Michael Drewniak (C), the Christie press secretary who has worked with him since his days as a prosecutor, has reportedly talked to a federal grand jury about the Bridgegate scandal . He would later claim the closure of several bridge on-ramp lanes during back-to-school week was part of a traffic study, intended  to determine if the rest of the bridge would move faster once lanes dedicated to the town of Fort Lee were repurposed, . Wildstein has claimed he told Christie about the lane closures – while they were in place – when the two spoke at a 9/11 memorial service in Manhattan. Christie has insisted he knew nothing until later when media outlets began asking questions. But the Port Authority bigwig – a former Christie schoolmate assigned to a position created just for him – met last week with prosecutors to tell his side of the story. McKenna was the governor's chief legal adviser while the plot was taking shape, and likely has inside information about any role of the governor's office had in coordinating the stories of officials connected to the scandal. Wildstein and fired Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, for instance, participated in the infamous email exchange that launched the investigation. 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote him. 'Got it,' he replied. Wildstein refused to testify before an investigative committee controlled by Democrats in the New Jersey legislature. So has Kelly. Christie fired her publicly in January. But Bill Baroni, another Port Authority higher-up, did testify in the fall, weeks before surrendering his job. Baroni stuck to he 'traffic study' story in a performance that Wildstein later said McKenna praised. Scene of the crime? The rightmost lanes into this George Washington Bridge entry plaza, normally reserved for traffic entering from the town of Fort Lee, N.J., were repurposed for general traffic during a week in September, bringing traffic in that town to a screeching halt . No love lost: US Attorney for the District of New Jersey Paul Fishman is looking into whether his old rival Chris Christie played a role in the George Washington bridge fiasco . Alleged ringleader: Former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly has refused to testify without a grant of immunity . As Christie prepares for what observers expect to be a tumultuous presidential run in 2016, his former underlings may be positioning themselves to cut deals with the government. Kelly and Wildstein have both said through their attorneys that they would share what they know if they were promised immunity from prosecution. There has been no sign that their wishes have been granted, but Wildstein's cooperation may point in that direction. His attorney Alan Zegas did not respond to a phone message seeking comment. Fishman, by all accounts a methodical and skilled federal prosecutor, reportedly holds no special place in his heart for the New Jersey governor who had the job before him. According to multiple witnesses at Christie's going-away party in the U.S. Attorney's office, Fishman – angry at Christie for taking so many skilled lawyers with him to the governor's office – threw a copy of a New Jersey directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. The Esquire writer whose scoop re-energized the Bridgegate story late on Monday is another anti-Christie partisan. Scott Raab wrote on Esquire.com that the March report clearing Christie 'is a steaming pile of crap, a classic Christie smear job, designed to reach the only result that might spare his political life.' 'Now that David Wildstein’s talking, his days as governor are numbered -- in weeks and months, not years,' a gleeful Raab predicted.","David Wildstein, the Port Authority figure at the center of the George Washington Bridge scandal, has met with the US Attorney's investigators .

"By . Tim Shipman . Ed Balls will today attempt to rebuild Labour's economic credibility by pledging to put Britain back in the black by 2020 if Labour is elected . Ed Balls will today attempt to rebuild Labour’s economic credibility by pledging to put Britain back in the black by 2020 if Labour is elected. The shadow chancellor will promise in a  speech to the Fabian Society annual conference to eliminate the budget deficit and get day-to-day government spending into surplus ‘as soon as possible’ in the next Parliament. But under Chancellor George Osborne’s plans the national debt will begin to fall in 2016/17 and he is committed to running an absolute budget surplus by 2018/19. Mr Balls’s pledge that he will get Britain out of the red by the end of the Parliament means he could take up to a year longer to achieve the same goal. Under Tory plans the surplus would cover all day-to-day government spending and capital spending on infrastructure projects. But Mr Balls will agree to run a surplus only on regular Whitehall budgets – opening the door for Labour to borrow more to fund infrastructure projects. While Mr Osborne has called for £25billion of further cuts to balance the books, Labour has been reluctant to spell out spending reductions, raising the prospect that the party will launch a new tax raid on the better-off. Mr Balls is set to claim he will display ‘an iron commitment to fiscal discipline’ – words likely to be derided by critics, who remember him as Gordon Brown’s right-hand man during the free spending days of the last government. The Shadow Chancellor will say: ‘With the deficit we inherit currently set to be nearly £80billion and the national debt still rising, it will  be up to the next Labour government to finish the job. ‘The next Labour government will balance  the books and deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt in the  next Parliament.’ He will add: ‘We will get the current budget into surplus as soon as possible in the next Parliament. How fast we can go will depend on the state of the economy and public finances we inherit.’ But he will acknowledge that a Labour government would ‘have to make cuts too’. The speech marks Mr Balls’ second major intervention on the economy after he announced last year that he would match overall Tory spending plans in 2015/16. Senior Labour sources have indicated that Mr Balls is also considering matching them for 2016/17. Under Chancellor George Osborne's plans the national debt will begin to fall in 2016/17 and he is committed to running an absolute budget surplus by 2018/19 . He will today refuse to give more detail about his timetable for the economy, saying that ‘no responsible Opposition can make detailed commitments and difficult judgments about what will happen in two or three years’ time’. But Stephen Ibbotson, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, called on Balls to explain how Labour will boost investment in business. He said: ‘Until questions such as how Labour would stimulate business investment, tackle government finances and enable more SMEs to export have been answered clearly, business will not feel confident in the run-up to the election.’","Shadow chancellor will make promise in a speech to the Fabian Society annual conference .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Ben Spencer . Time is running out to persuade the public of the benefits of fracking, David Cameron was warned last night. As MPs complained that plans to incentivise communities with a share of the profits of shale gas ‘do not go far enough’, the Prime Minister yesterday pledged that Britain would go ‘all out’ for shale gas. But in a stark warning, every MP in Lancashire and council leaders in the North West have written a joint letter to warn Mr Cameron that ‘opposition is hardening’ to fracking. Scroll down for video . David Cameron took a guided tour of the IGas shale drilling plant oil depot near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire . The PM insisted the government was going 'all out for shale gas' but critics said incentives were too low . All Mr Cameron's incentives were branded as 'bribes' by environmental campaigners today . The MPs, led by Ben Wallace, a . ministerial aide to Ken Clarke, say they will not back shale gas . exploration unless the Government gives communities more money. And . they warn Mr Cameron he will be throwing away a ‘once-in-a-generation . opportunity’ to close the North-South divide unless he acts now. Crucially, . the letter has also been signed by five council leaders, who are in . charge of deciding whether to allow fracking in their areas. Plans . outlined by the Prime Minister yesterday mean local councils can pocket . 100 per cent of the business rates collected from fracking firms – . double the previous amount – plus £100,000 for every well drilled. Protections will ensure fracking will only go ahead if environmental dangers can be avoided, Mr Cameron said . Demonstrators block the entrance to an I Gas shale drilling plant oil depot near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire during Mr Cameron's visit . But . local communities will get only 1 per cent of the total profits from . shale gas exploration – compared with the 10 per cent demanded by the .

It is important for . our country, it could bring 74,000 jobs, over £3billion in investment, . give us cheaper energy for the future, and increase our energy security.

"By . Tim Shipman . Set back: Cameron now has no hope of passing the legislation for a vote on EU membership before the next Queen's Speech after 245 peers voted to halt it . A bill to enshrine a European referendum in law was described as a ‘dead parrot’ last night after Labour and the Lib Dems united to block it. Nearly 250 peers voted to halt the Bill – backed by David Cameron – which would guarantee a nationwide in-out vote on EU membership in 2017. Peers passed two amendments to the legislation, effectively guaranteeing that it will run out of time in this Parliamentary session. Arch Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash echoed a Monty Python sketch in pronouncing its demise. He said: ‘As I understand it from the House of Lords, the European Union Referendum Bill is now, in effect, a dead parrot.’ Mr Cameron has vowed to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels before holding a referendum in 2017. But he could not introduce government legislation because of Lib Dem opposition. Instead, No10 backed a Private Member’s Bill introduced by Tory MP James Wharton, which was passed in the Commons after Labour and the Lib Dems abstained. Labour leader Ed Miliband has refused to make his position on the Bill clear but Labour and Lib Dem peers tabled 73 amendments to the Bill, many of them frivolous, to kill it off. Peers voted by 245 votes to 158 to amend the wording of the question that would be put to voters in the referendum. Eurosceptic: Bill Cash compared the Cameron-backed legislation for a vote on EU membership in 2017 to the collapsed, unfixable car in Monty Python's renowned 'dead parrot' sketch . Spoof: Shopkeeper Michael Palin and customer John Cleese discuss a Norwegian Blue parrot, used as a euphemism for the death of British culture . The change was backed by 67 Liberal Democrats, 138 Labour, 30 crossbench and just three Conservatives. EU red tape is costing British jobs and has imposed ‘unjustified’ blockages on cheap energy from shale gas, David Cameron said yesterday. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Prime Minister complained that ‘overwritten’ employment directives were driving employers away from the UK. He also said that failure to back shale gas exploration in Europe would cause businesses and investors to ‘head elsewhere’. The opportunities it presented could be undermined if the EU imposed unnecessary regulations. They also passed a second amendment that would require an impact assessment on the potential consequences of an EU exit. The change means the European Union (Referendum) Bill will have to go back to the Commons for further consideration. Since Private Member’s Bills can only be debated on Fridays, there is now no prospect of the legislation going through before the next Queen’s Speech. Lord Hill, Conservative Leader of the Lords, accused Labour and the Lib Dems of ‘yet another U-turn’ on their position on an EU referendum. ‘Having accepted this Bill in the House of Commons, they are now trying to kill it in the Lords,’ he said. A No10 source said the Tories would try to get another MP to reintroduce the legislation in the Commons in the next session of Parliament.","Nearly 250 peers voted to halt Bill for 2017 EU membership referendum .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 79-year-old substitute teacher in New Hampshire has chosen to quit her job rather than delete thousands of students and friends from her Facebook profile. 'Today will be my last day at Stevens High,' Carol Thebarge wrote on her page. 'I was given an ultimatum; to either delete every . student from my Facebook page and do not post pictures of them, or be . terminated.' She has been a paraprofessional and substitute teacher for 35 years with assignments at 32 different schools. Popular substitute teacher Carol Thebarge chose to resign rather than delete students from her Facebook page . She started substitute teaching at 44 after one of her grandchildren passed away. She is also active as a wedding planner and working on a certification for substance abuse counseling. Thought not certified for teaching, Thebarge was put in charge of classrooms as varied as technical or vocational classes. In cases where she was prevented from teaching because of rules - such as shop - she taught motivational subjects about truth, character, and honesty. She said she rigidly monitors who wants access to her page, blocking students if they act in ways she deems unbecoming. To be added, you must have been one of her students and you must have a picture on Facebook so she can confirm their identity. Thebarge said students would privately message her on Facebook seeking for help when they were depressed or feeling bullied . 'I've had a wonderful career,' she said. 'I have no resentment for their policy; they have to do what they have to do. I didn't want it to end this way.' She claimed school officials gave her an ultimatum after a math teacher, Christopher LeBlanc, was fired and charged with four counts of felonious sexual assault on a 14-year-old girl in his class. 'Don't penalize me for someone else,' she told the New Hampshire Union Leader. 'I am offended that I followed that by just a week.' She was first instructed to remove students from her page several years ago but after deleting 50 names said the feedback made her reconsider. 'I had  students that were asking me what did they do wrong ...,'  she said. 'I hid my list, but then I realized I had always taught them to . 'Live their truth' and I unblocked, and she (the administrator) left me . alone.' School officials have become more sensitive of social media boundaries after one teacher was arrested for an inappropriate sexual relationship with a student he was also interacting with on social media . Thebarge also said students would message her on her Facebook privately to seek advice about being bullied or depressed. Her retirement announcement has received more than 1,000 likes and more than 200 comments. While some students told her they would protest the ultimatum, she said she'd rather they stay in class. And though she might continue substitute teaching in another district, she will not be back in any of the familiar settings. 'I don't want to return to that school,' she said. 'It's not that I don't want to be with the kids, but the administration really let me down.' Claremont School Board policy bans teachers from 'friending' students on social media, said Middleton McGoodwin, the school superintendent. McGoodwin met with her last week to ask for her to reconsider, and told reporters she was a 'very caring person.' However they cannot allow exceptions to the rules. While Thebarge said she may continue substitute teaching it would not be in any of the former schools she frequented . 'In truth, being a caring, lovely woman doesn't give you immunity to ignore a school board policy that's designed to protect everyone,' he said. McGoodwin met with about 25 students Friday for 90 minutes to discuss the decision. 'Kids have passion and emotion, and they . didn't understand why we could be so heartless to a kind lady,' he said. He also said the decision was entirely Thebarge's choice as she had no contract with the school and could not be terminated. Instead they simply will not call her when substitute positions are available. LeBlanc's arrest has made school personal far more sensitive to professional boundaries. As of Saturday, a petition to 'reinstate Carol Thebarge' had more than 675 signatures.","Carol Thebarge, 79, started substitute teaching after one of her grandchildren died .

Scroll down for video... Sick: More than 200 people have fallen ill in the last week after a pot luck at a church in the Moapa Valley in Nevada . 'We had 80 people here on Monday. Just today we had three more patients who were at the potluck come in,' the official said. Patients have been complaining of aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Most have been sent home, but some have been given intravenous fluids, the official said. Health officials determined that food poisoning was the cause of the outbreak. Feeling ill: Wynette Bodily says she has had the worst week of her life and that the pain was worse than childbirth . 'It's been the worst week I've had. It's worse than childbirth, I think,' says Logandale resident Wynette Bodily. Husband Kody Bodily says, '[We've had] pains, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, chills, shaking and aching all over.' People in the town say residents became sick after a church potluck dinner was hosted on Saturday night. Locals say up to 200 people have fallen ill. Officials with the Southern Nevada Health District called the outbreak 'isolated and not contagious.' Potluck dinner: They  are often organized by religious or community groups, since they simplify the meal planning and distribute the costs among the participants but of course there's always a chance you could get sick . State health officials have been in the town all week, coordinating with hospitals and clergy at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. 'We’ve worked very closely with organizers of the event. They’ve done a very good job of coordinating with those who participated in the event. We don’t believe any other members of the public are affected by this,' Nancy Williams, a spokeswoman for SNHD, told KTNV-TV. Authorities have not determined which dish or dishes served at the dinner caused the outbreak and will not be testing any of the foods that were eaten that night because they were tossed in the trash after the dinner wrapped up. 'Our hearts go out, not only to the people that are sick, but those that are helping them,' church president Matt Messer told the station. The exact number of reported cases will likely be released by the health district sometime early next week.","Nevada health officials believe the cause was a pot luck lunch that took place last weekend .

"By . Hugo Duncan . and Tim Shipman . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Business chiefs led by the head of the CBI attacked Ed Miliband yesterday, warning that his ‘politically motivated’ anti-business policies will cost jobs and hold back the economic recovery. Bosses say Labour’s increasingly Left-wing agenda has led to them being demonised by politicians. Sir Mike Rake, president of the CBI and chairman of BT, said it is crucial to have ‘the right policies to create jobs for the economy’. He said: ‘There’s absolutely no doubt that business is concerned about some of the policy statements being made at the moment by Ed Miliband.’ Labour Ed Miliband has promised to intervene in the energy, housing and banking industries, raising fears among some business leaders . A senior FTSE 100 executive said he was concerned that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and Labour’s business spokesman Chuka Umunna, who are well regarded by business, are being sidelined by Mr Miliband. ‘People are starting to worry that these policies are not for show but will actually be implemented by Miliband,’ he added. Speaking to the Daily Mail at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the boss of one of the Big Four accountancy giants sounded the alarm over anti-business sentiment brewing in the UK. The founder of Pimlico plumbers Charlie Mullins accused Ed Miliband of 'dodgy anti-business rhetoric'. Charlie Mullins, who has backed the Tories in the past, warned the Labour leader's economic strategy would turn the clock back to the 1970s. He told MailOnline: 'I’ve been very critical of Ed Balls’ record on the economy, and quite honestly how anyone can be so consistently wrong on employment and growth and not get the boot I really don’t know. 'My best guess is that maybe he’s the fall guy for his boss Ed Miliband. As long as Balls stays on as a buffer, the other Ed’s dodgy anti-business rhetoric is kind of shrouded from view. 'But nevertheless where would we be as business people in this country under a regime headed by a man who doesn’t believe in Capitalism and who’s policies are influenced by the likes of Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Trade Union, Unite. 'I’ve heard it said that he’s just grandstanding for votes like many of the political class, but I actually think he’s more dangerous than that. I think he actually believes that the UK would be better off with the policies for the Labour party from the 1970s and 80s.' ‘Business is nervous that any politician could choose to demonise business as an easy target,’ said Simon Collins, chairman and senior partner of KPMG in the UK. While Mr Collins did not single out Mr Miliband by name, other company chiefs privately expressed horror at his stated desire to bring back Socialism, carve up the banks and freeze energy prices. A FTSE 100 boss said: ‘Ed Miliband doesn’t give a toss about business. He will say anything to get elected. It is economic vandalism.’ Company chiefs spoke out after a private breakfast with Chancellor George Osborne in Davos. Mr Osborne told the business leaders they must get ‘on the front foot’ to win back the public’s trust. They emerged to praise the Chancellor’s pro-business agenda and said they were increasingly confident about the British economy. Mr Collins, who hosted yesterday’s breakfast briefing along with the CBI lobby group, said the mood at the event was ‘very good’ and ‘very uplifting’. But he warned that next year’s general election was creating anxiety. ‘Businesses abhor uncertainty,’ he said. ‘Elections by definition cause uncertainty.’ Mr Collins, whose clients include a raft of blue-chip firms, said the Chancellor presented a confident pro-business message yesterday. ‘He, like all of us, feels that business has to get on the front foot and explain why it is an important part of society, not a drain on it,’ he said. ‘Business creates the GDP, it creates the wealth, it creates the jobs.’ Sir Roger Carr, former president of the CBI who becomes chairman of BAE Systems next month and was also at the breakfast, said: ‘The message we all received is that it is critically important to talk about the contribution big business makes to the wealth and health of the UK economy.’ Another who was present said: ‘It is not the time to be reticent. Business needs to speak out and point out that if we have an anti-business agenda it will cost jobs and damage growth.’ Business leaders gathering in Davos for the World Economic Forum are uneasy about the prospect of a Labour government . One London-based businessman said he was ‘taken aback’ by the ill-feeling towards Mr Miliband among British business leaders. ‘In private they are far more vocal about how bad it could be than I expected,’ he said. ‘People are worried.’ A chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm echoed the sentiment. ‘It is concerning,’ he said. ‘If they win and come out anti-business and anti-markets, of course it will have a detrimental effect on the economy.’ John Nelson, chairman of insurance giant Lloyd’s of London, said it was crucial that the Government continued to cut the deficit and back business. ‘If this recovery is going to be sustained we need to have the opposite of business-bashing,’ he added. ‘I don’t understand people saying business is a bad thing. This recovery is being driven by business.’ In another blow to the Labour leader, Sir John Armitt – who advises Labour on infrastructure policy – said Mr Miliband’s pledge to freeze energy bills could give investors the jitters and have a knock-on effect on investment in the energy market. He told The House magazine that when governments intervene in markets ‘economies do a darn sight worse’. The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecasts for the UK by more than any other major economy and expects gross domestic product to increase by 2.4 per cent this year. The Office for National Statistics is next week expected to report that the economy grew by nearly 2 per cent last year – the best performance since 2007. But Lord Adair Turner, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, warned that Britain has lurched back to its bad old ways of pumping up the economy through the housing market and debt-fuelled spending rather than exports and investment.","Labour leader promises to intervene in energy, housing and banking .

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron is facing a double rebellion this week as Tory MPs plan to defy Downing Street on immigration. Tory Nigel Mills made clear yesterday that he will force a vote to toughen up the Government’s Immigration Bill. He wants transitional controls on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants, which were lifted on January 1, to be re-introduced. Contentious issue: Around 70 Tory backbenchers are supporting calls to ban Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants from coming to work in the UK . And . despite efforts by No 10 to get him to drop the demands, allies of Mr . Mills said that between 40 and 50 MPs are still set to rebel when the . Bill reaches its report stage on Thursday. Mr Mills yesterday refused to rule out ‘crashing’ the Bill altogether unless backbenchers get their way. The . threat comes after Tory MP Dominic Raab revealed he has collected the . support of 105 MPs to end the scandal of foreign criminals claiming they . have a right to a ‘family life’ in the UK. Last night he said he is . ‘definitely pushing ahead’ with an amendment to the Bill that would make . it all but impossible for a foreign criminal to exercise their Article 8 . right to a ‘family life’. Mr Raab’s amendment removes the . discretionary element, so courts would have to order deportation of a . foreign criminal jailed for a year or more, unless he faced torture or . death on removal, or if halting deportation would be in the . ‘overwhelming humanitarian interests’ of the offender’s children. Ministers have been resisting the amendment, claiming it is so strict it could flout the Human Rights Act. Taken . together the two rebellions mean the Immigration Bill could see one of . the most damaging revolts yet by Tory backbenchers. Mr Mills said the . MPs want to send a signal to Tory high command that the Government needs . to do more to curb new arrivals, predicted to be between 250,000 and . 350,000 people over the next five years. He added: ‘I don’t want to crash this Bill at all but I think there are some more measures needed in it.’ Mr Mills also backed Mr Raab’s amendment.Labour MP Diane Abbott said the row showed a ‘real antagonism’ towards Prime Minister David Cameron from his backbenchers. She . said: ‘Nigel Mills is wishing for the impossible and if I was a Tory . whip I would be ringing my hands at this moment because he has not ruled . out crashing the Bill.

"By . Tim Shipman . Tough? Labour's Rachel Reeves signalled a toughening of opposition stance . Britain's three main parties were on a collision course with Brussels last night after they all backed plans to limit migrants’ benefits – in defiance of the European Commission. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said migrants should not be able to obtain welfare payments until they had been in the UK for two years – eight times the current limit of three months. And Labour’s Rachel Reeves signalled a toughening of the opposition’s stance, calling for them to receive handouts only if they had paid into the system first as taxpayers. Even Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was ‘eminently sensible’ to work with other EU nations to tighten the rules. But the growing consensus that the free movement of labour had gone too far was rejected by EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor.He called the proposed two-year limit ‘a problem’ that would violate EU rules. The Government has enshrined the current three-month limit in law after advice from its lawyers. But Mr Duncan Smith revealed that he is already talking to Britain’s allies, including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, about plans to dramatically extend it. He told the Sunday Times: ‘It could be a year, it could be two years. After that, then we will consider you a resident of the UK and be happy to pay you benefits.’ He said migrants should ‘demonstrate that you are committed to the country, that you are a resident and that you are here for a period of time and you are generally taking work and that you are contributing’. Far from criticising the Government, Miss Reeves made clear that Labour now supports the ‘contributory principle’ on benefits – a posture that won her predecessor as Mr Duncan Smith’s shadow, Liam Byrne, criticism from some on the Labour left. Mr Clegg said it was 'eminently sensible' for the Government to  'come to an agreement that says you have to jump through certain hoops before you can claim benefits' She said: ‘It has got to be right that you only get something out of our social security system if you put something in.’ Mr Clegg told Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live it was ‘eminently sensible’ for the Government to  ‘come to an agreement that says you have to jump through certain hoops before you can claim benefits’. But Mr Andor attacked politicians of all parties, branding them ‘nasty’ for the second time in a month and warning that Britain risks ‘losing friends’ if they continue with the same rhetoric. ‘We shouldn’t assume the UK welfare system is a lot more generous than that of many other countries,’ he said. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘It’s not the UK that is isolated, it is the European Commission that is isolated, sticking to rules that no longer command public support.'","Opposition and Lib Dems say migrants should be forced to wait for benefits .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A new robot mannequin that will help test the next generation of chemical and biological protective suits for the UK's armed forces has been unveiled. The Porton Man can walk, march, run, sit, kneel and even mimic the movement of a soldier sighting a weapon, allowing scientists to test the suits designed to protect UK personnel from chemical and biological attacks such as nerve agents like Sarin. The mannequin has been made for the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) in Porton Down, Wiltshire - where clothing systems worn by soldiers are tested against chemical warfare agents by Buckingham-based company i-bodi Technology Ltd. The Porton Man robot mannequin is helping to test chemical and biological protective suits for the UK armed forces . Mannequins have been used by Dstl in the past, but the new animatronic version has a raft of improvements from a moving head, to a better range of movement, and sensors all over its body that allow scientists to carry out real-time analysis while it is being tested. Previous models, brought into use in the late 1990s, helped influence the final design of the chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) suits currently used by the armed forces. Scientists today said the new creation - made using Formula 1 technology - will bring another 'step-change' in the way the next generation of protective clothing is designed to keep pace with future threats. Jaime Cummins, of Dstl's Chemical and Biological Physical Protection group, said the new Porton Man is much lighter than its predecessor - 14kg (30lb) instead of about 80kg (176lb) - and easier to move in and out of its test chamber. The mannequin has a full range of movement such as walking, marching, running, sitting and kneeling . While the previous version's head was attached to the frame it sits in, this one has a movable head that can test the effect it has on the equipment being worn, as well as removable thumbs to make it easier to put gloves on, and ankles that flex. The new version also sits on a rotating turntable so it can not only be tested in windy environments created by fans, but scientists can see what happens when that wind is coming from different directions. The latest Porton Man also comes with software that allows scientists to programme a range of movement to fit with certain scenarios, and help test what equipment would be like dealing with real situations in the field. Jaime Cummins (right), of Dstl's Chemical and Biological Physical Protection group, checks the Porton Man robot mannequin . The new mannequin has a movable head that can test the effect it has on the equipment being worn . Mr Cummins said: 'Significant advances in animatronics, material design and sensing technologies have all been incorporated into this new Porton Man mannequin. 'As a result, we will be able to assess and characterise protective clothing in ways which were not previously possibly. The new mannequin is hoped to help work on producing a new, lighter-weight protective suit for the future. The latest Porton Man comes with software that allows scientists to programme a range of movement similar to dealing with real-life situations in the field . Mr Cummins added: 'It's a better, more realistic test system, and we are now in a better position and better place to design and develop the next generation of CB (chemical and biological) protective suit equipment.' The new Porton Man, which Dstl said cost £600,000 to design and build, was made by i-bodi Technology, which has made mannequins before, but draws on experience of making animatronics and robotics for films and television. Chief executive Jez Gibson-Harris said they were tasked with producing a lightweight robotic mannequin based on data collected from 2,500 soldiers, that was easy to handle, had a wide range of movement. He said: 'Of course there were a number of challenges associated with this and one way we looked to tackle these challenges was through the use of Formula One technology. The new mannequin is hoped to help work on producing a new, lighter-weight protective suit for the future . 'Using the same concepts as those used in racing cars, we were able to produce very light but highly durable carbon composite body parts for the mannequin.' He added: 'We tried to make it far more realistic than the current Porton Man.' Minister for defence equipment, support and technology Philip Dunne said: 'This technology, designed by a British company, is enabling the UK to lead the way in this important testing. 'Increased investment in science and technology by the MoD (Ministry of Defence) is not only enabling battle-winning and lifesaving equipment to be developed but also helping innovative companies like i-bodi Technology to develop cutting edge capability.'","The Porton Man can mimic the movement of a soldier sighting a weapon .

"By . Tim Shipman . Britain’s most respected tax experts yesterday undermined Ed Balls’s case for raising the top rate of tax to 50p. Members of The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Shadow Chancellor’s proposal to re-introduce the measure would raise ‘little revenue’. The think-tank said it would make only a ‘marginal contribution’ to cutting the budget deficit. No use: Clothing tycoon Richard Caring (right) has accused Ed Balls of 'extreme Socialist nonsense' As the business backlash against Labour gathered pace, an opinion poll last night put Labour’s lead over the Tories at just one point. The ComRes survey for the Independent put Labour on 33 per cent, with the Tories on 32, UKIP on 14 and the Lib Dems trailing on 9. And at least eight more business leaders have signed a letter opposing Labour’s tax plans and warning that it would deter business and destroy jobs. One of the 31 who have now signified their concerns is a donor who has loaned Labour £2 million and says no businessman in Britain would do so again while the party targets entrepreneurs. Clothing tycoon Richard Caring, who also owns restaurants including The Ivy, accused Mr Balls of peddling ‘extreme socialist nonsense’ and said it would be ‘impossible’ for Labour to get funds from wealthy individuals in future. Mr Balls announced on Saturday that Labour would raise the income tax rate from 45p to 50p in the pound for those earning more than £150,000. Boris Johnson weighed in on the conflict by calling on the Chancellor to cut the top tax rate to 40p . He claimed it was justified to help eliminate the deficit, arguing that the top earners paid almost £10 billion more in tax in the three years when the 50p rate was in place than when the Government conducted its assessment of the tax back in 2012. But the IFS said Mr Balls was basing the figures on Treasury projections rather than real returns and said there was ‘little evidence’ to suggest that a 50p rate would raise more. The think-tank instead backed Chancellor George Osborne’s estimates that the top rate would bring in just £100 million extra – which the IFS called a ‘very small amount of money’. The think-tank concluded: ‘The best evidence we have still suggests that raising the top rate of tax would raise little revenue and make, at best, a marginal contribution to reducing the budget deficit an incoming government would face after the next election.’ The number of bosses opposing Mr Balls’s plans yesterday hit 31. They include Jo Shields, chairman of London’s Tech City. She said: ‘This is not a pro-aspiration policy. We want people to aspire, to want to succeed, to create jobs and, yes, to be rewarded for their hard work and risk.’ Mr Caring, who said he expects Labour to pay back the outstanding £200,000 of a £2 million loan he gave the party in 2006, said the present regime ‘seem to be prepared to say anything to get a vote’. ‘When you look at the arithmetic it’s a nonsense,’ he added. Mr Caring compared Mr Balls’s plans to those of French President Francois Hollande, who has had to backtrack after introducing a 75 per cent tax rate. ‘It’s the same deal. Extreme, extreme, socialist nonsense,’ he said. He said it would now be ‘impossible’ for Labour to get loans from donors. He said of the tax plans: ‘I don’t think you’ll find any businessman in this country who will say it’s a smart idea, because it isn’t.’ Even the Financial Times, where Mr Balls once worked, denounces his plans this morning as ‘yet one more measure to punish enterprise’. David Cameron insisted his own decision to cut the rate to 45p had been the best for the country. ‘Labour are now doing something that’s politically convenient but is very, very bad for our economy’, he told the Federation of Small Businesses. London Mayor Boris Johnson even called for the Tories to return to a tax rate to 40p, the level at which it remained for almost all of the last Labour government. But Ed Miliband yesterday defended the plans as ‘utterly fair and utterly reasonable’ because of a squeeze on living standards. The Labour leader has previously stated publicly that a 50p rate should be permanent. However, Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna last night said it would only be a temporary measure. He added: ‘This isn’t some ideological expedition.’","Institute for Fiscal Studies members say plans will raise 'little revenue'

"By . Martin Robinson . Upset: Roy Cooper said his wife Mary, pictured, was put on a controversial care plan for terminally ill people without his agreement . A devastated husband has claimed his critically ill wife was stuck onto a hospital's 'death row' against his wishes. Roy Cooper, 79, said Mary, also 79, was put on a controversial care plan for terminally ill people without his agreement and then 'left to die in a side room'. The tragic mother-of-four died on August 13 after spending eight weeks at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk. The pensioner spoke out as calls grew for a review into the . so-called Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP), which is widely accepted as a way of . allowing those at the end of their lives to die with dignity. LCP's objective is to ensure that a . dying person is treated in his or her last days with as much comfort as possible by ruling out potentially distressing . interventions aimed at prolonging their lives. But critics say while in some cases it has been used properly as intended, with . numerous others it has become, instead, a backdoor form of euthanasia. Mr Cooper, of Clenchwarton, Norfolk, said: 'They never told me about the plan and no-one explained it to me. 'To me it felt like she was put onto death row and left to die in a side room.' The retired train driver added: 'I would never have let her go to hospital if I had known what I do now. 'After finding out she was on the pathway, we offered to take her home to die but was told we couldn't.' It is widely used in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, both in hospitals and hospices and supported by health-related charities. But concerns have grown that it is being used inappropriately. Tens of thousands of patients are placed every year on the pathway. The scheme aims to ensure that the 'right type of care is available for people in the last days or hours of life when all of the possible reversible causes for their condition have been considered'. But Mr Cooper said: 'I got the feeling the quicker she went the better because it would stop them looking after her for another week. 'I really don't think it is right for doctors to play God and put people on this plan.' Devastated: Roy and his daughter Maxine have complained to the hospital they claim left Mary to die in a side room . Diabetic Mary was taken to hospital on June 19 after collapsing with low blood sugar levels. The seriously ill OAP had been taking antibiotics for a foot infection which had put her off food and led to her collapse. Mrs Cooper was moved into different wards around the hospital. At one stage her distraught sons Robert, Gary and daughters Glenda Woods and Maxine Richardson were told that she might return home soon. The pathway was mentioned to Mrs Richardson by doctors as one of several options available as her condition deteriorated after five weeks in hospital. But her family was not told when she was actually placed on the system. Mrs Richardson, of Hunstanton, Norfolk, said: 'When we were told she was on the pathway plan, they said there was nothing more they could do for her. 'They said they would make her as comfortable as possible and free from pain but they really didn't explain what was actually going to happen.' She staged a heartbreaking vigil at her fast-fading mum's bedside for the last two weeks of her life. The cause of Mrs Cooper's death was put down as a heart attack, pulmonary oedema, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease. The angry family have now complained to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. They received a reply from the hospital trust's chief executive Patricia Wright last month and are now considering their next step. A Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokesman said: 'We are deeply sorry for the family's loss. We have responded to them and answered the points they have made. 'We will make every effort to contact the family to talk things through with them in more detail.'","Mary Cooper, 79, was put on the Liverpool Care Pathway -designed to allow patients to die with dignity and not have life prolonged painfully .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Officials say the number of passengers believed to be sick with the highly contagious norovirus has nearly doubled aboard a cruise ship sailing to ports in California. Princess Cruises spokeswoman Karen Candy said on Wednesday that 66 passengers and 17 crew members were sick and had to be isolated to their cabins aboard the Crown Princess. The update, issued Wednesday, shows that the number has doubled from Monday's original count of 37 passengers. Dealing with disease: A total of 83 people have reportedly contracted norovirus on this Princess Cruise ship . Officials believe norovirus is to blame for the illnesses but they have not confirmed it with tests yet. The disease is spread person-to-person and can include nausea and diarrhea. Candy says the ship's staff has disinfected door handles and other surfaces. The Crown Princess is on a seven-day cruise that includes stops in San Diego and Santa Barbara. Locked away: The infected passengers on board the ship are being isolated to their cabins . It is scheduled to end in Los Angeles on Saturday but has been stopped in San Francisco as they address the outbreak. Norovirus is known for spreading rapidly in contained, highly-traffic areas and cruise ships have been highly-susceptible in the past. More than 120 people caught the disease on board a Holland America cruise ship. In the month of January alone, the CDC reported that there were in excess of 600 cases of norovirus on cruise ships in the Caribbean.","A Princess Cruises ship has been stopped in San Francisco as it deals with an outbreak of a gastrointestinal virus .

"By . Associated Press . U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited China's sole aircraft carrier on Monday in an unprecedented opening by normally-secretive Beijing to a potent symbol of its military buildup. A U.S. official said the visit to the carrier the Liaoning, at a port in the northern city of Qingdao, lasted about two hours. No other details were immediately available. The official believed Hagel was the first official visitor from overseas to be allowed on board the Liaoning in a sign that China is responding to U.S. criticism over it's lack of transparency regarding its growing weapons programme. The secretive visit comes days after the United States promised to send two missile defence ships to Japan to counter the growing threat from both North Korea and China. Lone mission: Escorted by Chinese military personnel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel arrives at Qingdao International Airport in Qingdao . Growing power: The 60,000-tonne Liaoning, a Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and re-fitted in a Chinese shipyard, is seen as a symbol of China's growing naval power and ambition for greater global influence . Hagel's carrier visit, at the start of his three-day trip to China, was quietly approved by Beijing at Washington's request, the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 60,000-tonne Liaoning, a Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and re-fitted in a Chinese shipyard, is seen as a symbol of China's growing naval power and ambition for greater global influence. The carrier has yet to become fully operational, however, and military experts say it could be decades before China catches up to the far superior and larger U.S. carriers - if ever. Hagel arrived in Qingdao after a trip to Japan. Warm welcome: Hagel, left, is welcomed by Rear Admiral Guan Youfei, Director of Foreign Affairs Office of the Chinese Defense Ministry and U.S. Ambassador to China, Max Baucus . The carrier has yet to become fully operational, however, and military experts say it could be decades before China catches up to the far superior and larger U.S. carriers - if ever . Early this year the Liaoning completed . sea trials in the South China Sea. The official Xinhua News Agency said . the carrier tested its combat system, conducted a formation practice and 'attained the anticipated objectives.' Reporters travelling with Hagel did not accompany him on the vessel, in what is a rare visit to a sensitive Chinese military site. 'It's a sign of openness, of sincerity, that China has nothing to hide and wants to improve military relations with the United States,' said Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. 'It will also be a good opportunity for the Americans to see the difference between the Liaoning and their aircraft carriers,' Ni said, referring to the technological gulf between the two countries. Chinese military brass are no strangers to U.S. warships, including aircraft carriers. Officers from the People's Liberation Army are routinely flown to U.S. aircraft carriers en route to occasional port stops in Hong Kong, according to U.S. military officials. Their U.S. counterparts provide tours of the ship and flight deck during operations - efforts U.S. diplomats say are geared to nudging China towards greater transparency about its capabilities. Ian Storey, a Singapore-based regional security expert, said earlier that Hagel's visit would be 'long on symbolism but short on actual operational capabilities'. 'By showing him a vessel that was built in Ukraine in the 1980s and remains only a training platform that is still not fully operational, the Chinese will be keeping him away from their more sensitive capabilities, such as their missile programmes or submarine fleets,' said Storey, of Singapore's Institute of South East Asian Studies. Waging diplomacy: Hagel is on a 10-day trip to the Asia Pacific region and was leaving Japan today to travel to China. He is scheduled to meet with senior Chinese leaders before traveling to Mongolia, then returning home . China is building submarines, surface ships and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and has tested emerging technology aimed at destroying missiles in mid-air. The carrier visit came a day after . Hagel said he would use his first trip to China as defense secretary to . press Beijing to use its 'great power' wisely and respect its . neighbours, who have been put on edge by the country's growing . assertiveness in Asia's disputed waters. China . claims 90 per cent of the 1.35 million sq mile South . China Sea, which is believed to be rich in oil and gas. The . Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim parts of . those waters. China has a . separate dispute with Japan in the East China Sea over uninhabited . islets that are administered by Japan. China's decision in November to . declare an air defence identification zone in the area that includes . those islands sparked protests from the United States, Japan and South . Korea. The Liaoning would serve as a training platform rather than a fighting weapon, some Chinese experts have said. Considerable . doubt also remains over when it will be fully operational. Earlier . estimates of two or three years had grown rubbery, with some hints . internally that it could stretch to a decade, some experts say.

"By . Anna Edwards . and Sean O'hare . and Anthony Bond . Wanted: Whistleblower Edward Snowden has not accepted an offer of asylum from Venezuela, Wikileaks said tonight . Whistleblower Edward Snowden has not yet formally accepted asylum in Venezuela,  WikiLeaks said today. The anti-secrecy group made the announcement on Twitter this evening after a Russian politician tweeted earlier today that the former U.S. spy agency contractor had accepted political asylum from the South American country. 'Edward Snowden has not yet formally . accepted asylum in Venezuela,' Wikileaks, whose British legal researcher . Sarah Harrison is assisting Snowden and travelled to Moscow with him, . later said on Twitter. It added: 'The states concerned will make the announcement if and when the . appropriate time comes. The announcement will then be confirmed by us.' Unofficial spokesman for the Kremlin Alexei Pushkov had prompted the speculation today when he tweeted that the fugitive, believed to be in Russia and wanted by the US . authorities for leaking security secrets, had accepted the offer from Venezuela. The tweet was removed a few minutes after it was posted. Soon after the tweet's disappearance he sent another message saying his claim was based on a report from the state all-news television channel Vesti. However, no such information could be found on Vesti's website and no Russian news agency reported that Vesti had ever said it. The TV channel could not immediately be reached for comment and the Kremlin declined comment on today's developments. Mr Snowden, who revealed details of a US intelligence program to monitor internet activity, went to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on June 23 and was believed to be headed for Cuba. But he did not board that flight is believed to have been stranded in the airport's transit lounge ever since. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had already offered asylum to Mr Snowden while Bolivia and Nicaragua said they too would grant asylum to the American fugitive. Scroll down for video . Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has offered the fugitive a safe haven and 'humanitarian asylum' Ecuador said it will consider any asylum request. Mr Maduro said it is perhaps the world's 'first collective humanitarian asylum' with various countries saying 'Come here!' But . the United States has cancelled Mr Snowden's passport and it is unclear . if he has travel documents he would need to leave Moscow. Mr Maduro said Mr Snowden 'will have to decide when he flies here, if he finally wants to travel here.' On Friday he said: 'As head of state, . the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela decided to offer . humanitarian asylum to the young American Edward Snowden so that he can . live (without) ... persecution from the empire,' Maduro said, referring . to the United States. He made the offer during a speech . marking the anniversary of Venezuela's independence. It was not . immediately clear if there were any conditions to Venezuela's offer. 'In the name of America's dignity ... I have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to Edward Snowden,' Maduro . proclaimed during a military parade marking the country's Independence . Day. The escape route is fraught with problems for Snowden, and would mean him having to gain access to Russia and then taking a huge detour . 'He is a young man who has told the . truth, in the spirit of rebellion, about the United States spying on the . whole world,' Maduro said. But the Obama administration said yesterday . that U.S. diplomats are working behind the scenes to make it difficult . for Snowden to find safe harbor in any of the nations that have offered . him asylum. Snowden has received a temporary travel . document to fly to Caracas, Venezuela, and both Bolivia and Nicaragua . have also offered him political asylum, but White House Press Secretary . Jay Carney told reporters during his regular briefing that the United . States will do what it can to stop him. 'The United States has been in touch via . diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries through which . Mr. Snowden might transit or which might serve as final destinations for . Mr. Snowden,' Carney said. U.S. diplomats, he added, have 'made very clear that he has been charged with a felony, or with felonies, and, as such, he should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than travel that would result in him returning to the United States.' An air plane, a supposed Aeroflot flight to Havana, rolls out in preparation for a take-off seen through a window of Sheremetyevo airport outside Moscow, Russia . It's not clear whether the Obama . administration is hoping a Latin American nation will double-cross . Snowden and offer him up to Washington after he arrives from Russia. But the U.S., Carney said, is still working to persuade Moscow to short-circuit the process and turn the fugitive over before he can leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo-2 airport. Sources say Snowden will not be allowed to board the only Aeroflot plane that offers direct connections to Caracas, a regular service to Cuban capital Havana. The routing overflies both the EU and the US and there are fears the plane will be denied rights to Western airspace, and forced to land, leading to Snowden's arrest. The direct distance from Moscow to Caracas is 6,175 miles but it appeared too far for Snowden. The escape route for Snowden is fraught with problems. In order for Snowden to get from Moscow to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas without facing threat of U.S. extradition he would need to take an indirect, 7,000 mile route to avoid U.S. airspace. Cuba is the only country in which Snowden could land safely in a commercial plane without facing extradition but would have to pass through U.S. airspace or that of a U.S. ally whereby it could be forced to land prematurely. A private jet is considered the best bet for Snowden but it is likely to cost in the region of $200,000 to charter and would need to be of a certain size in order to reach Caracas the long way round without refuelling. So far, Venezuela has yet to offer to cover the cost of Snowden’s journey, meaning he will have to rely on either a private donor or Wikileaks to stump up the money. A Gulfstream V jet would be up to the job but it then becomes a question of how many are available in Russia and who would be prepared to face the wrath of America by loaning one to its most wanted man. With Russia getting publicly impatient with the US whistleblower's presence in its transit zone, his escape route is a logistical nightmare. 'Instead of going west to Venezuela, his obvious option is east to Vladivostok and then across the Pacific to Caracas,' said one source. It would mean Russia allowing him to formally enter its territory, which so far it has refused to do, unwilling to upset the US. This would also involve a 14,200 mile detour and a routing that would bring him close to the US state of Hawaii posing a risk to any private plane willing to take him on a route where there are no scheduled services. One option for the fugitive is to charter a private plane. Former CIA analyst Allen Thomson said: 'A private plane certainly looks like the best bet to me.'It has the advantage of simplicity and minimum involvement by the Russian government,' Mother Jones reported. As Thomson told Foreign Policy, Snowden could avoid US-influenced airspace by flying north to the Barents Sea, through the Denmark Strait, head soutwhile avoiding Canaa's Newfoundland, until getting to the east of the Windward Islands, then squeezing through between islands.","Anti-secrecy group made announcement after Russia politician said Snowden had accepted political asylum from the South American country .

Sharpton said that he was threatened by mobsters who felt that he was competing for their handle on the music industry, but new documents made public by The Smoking Gun show that the FBI had tapes of Sharpton trying to buy cocaine from an undercover agent. In 1983, Sharpton met an agent who was posing as a former South American drug lord and was trying to arrange a way for the man to launder money through boxing promotions that the Reverend could arrange. At the second of these two meetings with the undercover agent, Sharpton was confronted with the tape of his earlier meeting when he was talking about buying 'pure coke' from the 'druglord'. The Smoking Gun claims that it was at that point when Sharpton 'flipped' and agreed to start working as a paid informant for the FBI. In his assertions since the story broke, Sharpton said that he started working for the FBI in 1984 but a document from that year published today by The Smoking Gun shows that the FBI had been working with him for a year at that point. The report tells how CI-7, which was . Sharpton's code name, 'has been providing information to the FBI for a . period in excess of one year'. 'This . information has never been found to be false or inaccurate. Information . furnished by CI-7 has been corroborated by independent investigations . and by informants,' the report reads. On tape: Footage shows Al Sharpton (in the cowboy hat) unknowingly met with an undercover FBI agent in 1983 . Incriminating: New reports suggest that these taped undercover videos were used to get Sharpton to agree to work as a paid informant for the FBI . The arrangement led to Sharpton recording numerous conversations with mob bosses like Vincent 'Chin' Gigante, but, Sharpton had a different explanation for how that arrangement was made when he held a press conference Tuesday. 'Rats are usually people that were with other rats,' he said in the animated press briefing. 'I was not and am not a rat, because I wasn't with the rats. I'm a cat. I chase rats.' Sharpton said he went to the FBI after he was threatened by mobsters working in the music business. 'In my own mind I was not an informant,' Sharpton said. 'I was cooperating with an investigation.' 'It . is interesting to me, as we deal with the whole criminalization of many . in our community, that the premise of a lot of this media is that I . should have been with the mob rather than with the government,' he said . in response to the media reports. Sharpton said that he did indeed use a recording device in a briefcase but defended his actions. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio . stood by the famed activist at the kick-off of Sharpton’s annual . National Action Network conference  Wednesday. 'I just want everyone to know I am proud to stand with Reverend Sharpton,' de Blasio at an event on Wednesday. At the time: A heavier Sharpton (in blue track suit, center) is pictured during a march in 1998. Years earlier he had began informing against mob bosses, reports said . Caught: Vincent 'Chin' Gigante (C) was a Genovese crime . family boss who pretended to be mentally ill to escape arrest - but Sharpton helped foil his plot when . he taped other mob figures discussing the ruse . The . report's timing became a distraction for Sharpton a day before he was . to host President Barack Obama as the keynote speaker at the annual . convention his civil rights group, the National Action Network. The MSNBC host complained that he was unfairly portrayed as a turncoat mob associate instead of a victim. Sharpton . said that he went to federal authorities after low-level mobsters . warned him and others they would be harmed if they continued to compete . for a stake in the music business — a claim he recounted in his 1996 . book, 'Go and Tell Pharaoh.' 'We were threatened, and that's not a new story,' Sharpton said. 'It's in my book.' Sharpton . claimed that after the FBI targeted him in a failed sting, he 'fought . back and said, 'I'm being threatened. These are the kinds of guys you . should be going after.'' For . about two years, the FBI enlisted Sharpton to record conversations with . mob figures using a bug hidden in a briefcase, he said. His role, he said, was to try to get them to repeat the threats and also talk about any other crimes. Support: New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said that he was proud to stand with Sharpton at his annual civil rights conference for the National Action Network on Wednedsay . He added: 'I made the right decision. ... The only thing I'm embarrassed by are those old fat pictures.' The Smoking Gun report was based on court documents and FBI memos released in response to Freedom of Information requests. They included a draft affidavit by an FBI agent investigating allegations that the Genovese crime family had a lucrative 'stranglehold' on music industry executive Morris Levy. The FBI 'has developed a relationship with a confidential informant, hereafter referred to as 'CI-7,'' who agreed to record conversations with a mobster with inside knowledge of the Levy shakedown, the affidavit says. In one conversation in 1984, it says the mobster told CI-7 that Levy 'has tried to end his relationship with the Genovese family 10 to 15 times but that he has 'only has one way out,' at which point (he) gestured like someone pointing a gun and pulling the trigger.' Big names: Attorney General Eric Holder also spoke at the convention and President Obama is slated to attend tomorrow . The information from Sharpton helped investigators persuade judges to approve wiretaps on phones at the Manhattan home of Genovese boss Vincent 'The Chin' Gigante and to bug a social club where the Gigante hung out, the report said. Gigante, who known for faking mental illness by shuffling through his Greenwich Village neighborhood in bathrobe and slippers, was convicted in 1997 of racketeering and murder conspiracy. He died in prison at 77 in 2005. Asked about the report after an unrelated City Hall press conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio said it wouldn't change his 'positive view' of Sharpton. 'What's obvious from what he said this very morning is that he was asked by the FBI to support their efforts and he agreed to help, and that's exactly what a citizen should do,' the mayor said.","New reports contradict Rev.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . A sign from God or just a water stain - that is what people in Griffith, Indiana, have been wondering ever since a group of school children noticed what appeared to be a tear-stained cheek on a statue of Mary at St. Mary Catholic Church. The sight of the 'weeping' sculpture is moving some people to tears as others caution against a rush to judgment. Among the skeptics is the church pastor, the Rev. Theodore Mens. Miracle or rain drop: A water stain some believe to be a tear runs down the right check on a statue of Mary at St. Mary Church in Griffith, Indiana . 'There must be a natural explanation â€” the cold, the melting of the snow,' he said. 'Whenever we see . something, we always look for a natural reason first.' The white statue, about 4 feet tall, depicts Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Surrounded by tulips waiting to bloom, it stands in what parishioners call the 'sunken garden' along Broad Street and is the site of the annual May crowning. Mens said the statue has been there for at least as long as the 21 years he has been at St. Mary Church. Majdolin Haddad, religious education secretary at St. Mary, said her daughter Reta, an aide in the fourth-grade Monday night class, told her about the tear. Students in the class had left the church after confession, paused at the statue to pray and noticed a droplet of water clinging to the chin of Mary's face, appearing to originate from the right eye. A photo taken Tuesday morning shows the droplet intact. It was gone by early afternoon. Mens saw the photo but was reluctant to read anything into it. 'Everything we need to know for our salvation has been made known,' Mens told The Times. Proven occurrences elsewhere in the world are signs of added grace from Mary, he said. 'The message of Our Lady throughout history wherever appearances have been proven has always been the same, which is the scripture teaching of: repent, stop sinning, be baptized, believe in the Gospel,' he said. Mens said he is not necessarily a nonbeliever. Curiosity: Jason Seitz, of Griffith looks at the statue of Mary standing in front of the parish office at St. Mary church in Griffith . Without a trace: A photo taken Tuesday morning shows the droplet intact. It was gone by early afternoon . 'I'm not going to say anything against a possible further sign of God's love for us through Mary,' he said. 'I just don't want to fall for anything. I am formed and shaped by the scriptures and the teachings of Jesus, not necessarily by a tear that somebody sees on a statue.' If the statue brings people closer to God, that's wonderful, he said. Mens has no plans to further investigate the statue, and the Diocese of Gary has not issued a statement. 'The diocese has just found out about it and is not prepared to comment at this time,' said Debbie Bosak, director of communications for the Diocese of Gary. As word spread Tuesday, people visited the statue. Chicago resident Chris Kovich, who was in Griffith on business, theorized rain water may have followed the curve in the statue's veil, dripping on its face. Kovich, who described himself as a lapsed Catholic, said it is premature to make assumptions about the appearance of tears. 'It is what it is,' he said. Doubting Thomas: The church pastor, the Rev. Theodore Mens, is skeptical about the apparition, insisting that there must be a natural explanation for the water stain on Mary's sculpted face . 'Lupe Figueroa ran her hand along the cheek and jaw of the statue. 'A member of the Altar and Rosary Society at St. Mary Church, Figueroa had heard of the statue's supposed tears Tuesday morning and stopped by. 'She visited again in early afternoon for another look. 'Griffith resident Jason Seitz heard from his mother about the statue. 'You can definitely see the dry teardrop,' he said. Seitz said he was undecided.""I'm a realist, but I'm also a believer and Christian,"" he said.Mens doubts the statue will reach worldwide fame as other occurrences, such as Marian apparitions.""I don't think this will become Lourdes or Fatima or anything,"" he said.","The 4-foot-tall white statue has stood outside at St. Mary Catholic Church in Griffith, Indiana, for more than 20 years .

"By . James Gordon . A year-long outbreak of salmonella has now sickened more than 500 people in 25 states. Health officials say recently purchased raw poultry from Foster Farms appears to be the cause. Most of the people who have fallen sick live in California although people as far away as Texas have been infected. Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned that the outbreak involves seven rare strains of drug-resistant Salmonella. Shuttered: A truck enters the Foster Farms processing plant  in Livingston, California. The plant is one of three in California linked to a salmonella outbreak that has sickened 500 people across the country . Outbreak: More than 500 people across 25 states have been poisoned by Salmonella, the majority of which are in California . The government is still not issuing a recall, but instead chooses to warn people to 'handle chicken safely.' A tiny drop of juice from this contaminated meat could easily sicken an entire family. 'Basically, . what we’re saying is the outbreak is not over,' said Dr. Rob Tauxe, the . CDC’s deputy director of foodborne, waterborne and environmental . diseases to NBC News. 'As the new cases have been reported, almost all of them report eating chicken and almost all say it’s Foster Farms.' CDC officials had originally declared the outbreak that began in March 2013 over in January. Officials have now detected even more infections caused by the rare salmonella strains. Infested: The plant was infested with cockroaches similar to these, officials said . Most people infected with salmonella bacteria develop diarrhea, fever, nausea/vomiting and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The infection can last up to four days, but it could be months before the digestive system returns to normal. In extreme cases it can also cause Reiter's syndrome, which can last for years and cause arthritis. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness from a salmonella infection. Despite the . illnesses, U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection . Service officials say they have not asked Foster Farms to recall any . potentially contaminated meat. Fresh . chicken parts, not frozen poultry stored in freezers, appear to be . responsible for 524 cases so far with  194 people having been . hospitalized because the strains are very virulent and are resistant to . antibiotics.. More than three-quarters of the cases have been reported in California. At . one point, officials threatened to shut down three Foster Farms chicken . plants because inspectors detected high levels of salmonella. Cockroach infestation was just one of a number of problems at Foster Farms chicken slaughter facilities which were forced to close in January. There have been five incidents at the Livingston facility . involving cockroaches dating back to last September . USDA and company officials said that Foster Farms later brought its levels into compliance. The product in question: Foster Farms fresh chicken fillets have been linked to a salmonella outbreak that has . sickened hundreds, with outbreaks continuing for more than a year . In a press statement . released Wednesday, Foster Farms noted that the company was “steadily . reducing Salmonella levels” at its facilities. The statement continued: . 'Foster Farms is committed to leadership in food safety and producing the safest chicken on the West Coast. Since . October 2013, Foster Farms has developed a multiple-hurdle approach to . reduce or eliminate Salmonella at each stage of production – from . screening breeder flocks before entering the Foster Farms system, to . farms where the birds are raised, to the plants where the chicken is . processed as a whole bird and when it is cut into parts. As . a result, the company has steadily reduced the prevalence of Salmonella . at the parts level toward a goal of less than 10 percent – well below . the USDA-measured industry benchmark of 25 percent.' The . company’s statement also said: 'Foster Farms reminds consumers to . practice proper food handling and cooking practices at all times, and . especially during the warmer months' and quoted food-safety advice from . the CDC: 'Salmonella illness is more common in the summer. Warmer . weather gives bacteria more opportunity to contaminate food.' Authorities advise chicken should be cooked to 165 degrees . Fahrenheit.","The Livingston, California facility has been closed numerous times for hygiene violations .
There have been at least five incidents involving pests such as cockroaches at the location .
The plant is also responsible in part for a salmonella outbreak that has sickened hundreds ."
"By . Jessica Jerreat . Bake sale: Saira Munoz could be deported over her arrest for selling pot brownies in school . A California student arrested for selling pot brownies to raise money for her prom dress could be deported to Mexico. Saira Munoz came up with the money-making scheme while at River Valley High School last year and even employed a fellow student to help sell the brownies. But the teenager, who was 18 at the time, was arrested after a student fell sick and had to be taken to hospital after eating one of the drug-laced cakes. Munoz was sentenced to nine days in prison and four years' probation on Monday but the teenager was also told she could face being deported after her sentence ends. Because she arrived in the U.S. in 2000 with only temporary permission to remain in the country, her felony charge for employing a minor to sell marijuana could be used as reason to send her back to Mexico. Friends of the former student, who currently works in a restaurant, are upset that she could face deportation for her mistakes. 'I was hurt, because she got arrested, and nobody wanted to see somebody we cared about go away,' Carlos Robles, who went to school with Munoz, told CBS News. 'There's people that deserve to be deported, and she just wasn't one of them. There's people that do way worse,' he added.

"By . Dan Bloom . and Helen Pow . A 130lb dog which mauled a four-year-old girl to death may have been the offspring of an 'inbred' breeding pet with more than 200 descendants. Users of online breeding forums claimed Niko, the 'monster' dog shot dead by police in Houma, Louisiana, after killing Mia Derouen, was the offspring of an American bully called Kimbo. An unconfirmed online profile said Kimbo was inbred, while an owner of one of the dog's sons claimed he had also been savagely attacked while out swimming, according to reports by the Times-Picayune in New Orleans. Claims: It is reported this image shows the father of Niko, a dog which mauled a four-year-old to death . Tragic: Four-year-old Mia Derouen, pictured, was mauled to death by her family's dog . The man calling himself Zach Dank wrote: 'Four years ago I was viciously attacked by my Kimbo son... I slept with him, loved him, took him swimming everyday at the river. 'One day I was swimming in about 10 foot deep water and he swam out to me and started snapping his jaws at my face for no reason at all. I could see in his eyes that he was mentally gone. 'I tried to push his head away so I could swim to shore. As I did this, he got my full forearm in his mouth... He snapped both bones in my arm and ripped all my forearm muscles in half.' Police originally said Niko, who mauled Mia while she watched TV, was a pit bull, though it has emerged it may have been of a mixed breed. Kimbo's owner told the Times-Picayune he was being wrongly blamed, however. 'Monster': Niko was a 130 pound beast of a dog - the average pit bull weighs in around 50 pounds . Birthday: Mia was due to turn five the week after the attack on March 25 . 'Kimbo has over 200 offspring and most of the owners have families with kids,' he said. 'Nothing like this has ever happened.' Police . officers were called to Mia's apartment complex on March 25 by her . mother, Megan Touchet, who was also injured as she desperately fought . the crazed dog off her child. 'The mother was able to get away from the pit bull and barricade herself in a bedroom where she screamed for help and handed over her 4-year-old child through a window to medical personnel,' a police spokesman said. According to police, the attack happened inside the family home. 'She was screaming for help,' they said of the desperate mother's 911 call. Vicious attack: Mia, pictured with her dad Chris, was pounced on by the dog, one of two at her mom's home in the Houma Highland Apartments . Mia suffered facial and head injuries in the pit bull attack and was rushed to Terrebonne General Medical Center but later died. Touchet suffered moderate injuries and was hospitalized too. Niko was shot dead by police before they were able to enter the apartment. Police described it as 'a monster' and said it was 'running loose inside the apartment acting in a very vicious manner'. Officers shot it three times to 'eliminate the threat of additional injuries.' Mia would have celebrated her fifth birthday the next week. Her father, Chris Derouen, took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital. Frantic call: Police officers were called to the complex around 7 p.m. by the girl's mother, Megan Touchet, who was also injured as the fought the crazed dog off her child . Prayers: Her father, Chris Derouen, picured, took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital. She later died . 'Please I need prayers,' he wrote. 'My daughter was attacked by a pit bull and they don't know if she will make it....please God...I need this miracle.' After she passed away he covered his wall with pictures of the two of them, and friends and family expressed their sympathies. Claudet said the family had another pit bull. 'They had two pit bulls, and one was over 100 pounds,' he said, adding that the larger dog was the one that attacked Mia. 'Unfortunately, that's what happened and it's such a horrific event,' he said. The second pit bull was taken away by animal control officers, police said, and counseling was being offered to the officers who were called to 'horrific' scene. The families have set up a gofundme page to raise money for Mia's funeral expenses.","Mia Derouen died after mauling at her father's home in Houma, Louisiana .

"By . Associated Press . Dozens of Jackson residents who were evacuated after land began shifting on a hillside in this Wyoming resort town are waiting to find out if and when they can return home. Assistant Town Manager Roxanne Robinson said today there is still no word on what is causing the East Gros Ventre Butte land to shift, but officials have taken steps to ensure there is no catastrophe. Geologists are on the scene, and other geologists are being brought in to get a better idea of what is happening. About two dozen people went to the Red Cross to get shelter yesterday. Police say they talked to 52 people, and some evacuees said they were told authorities are not returning until it is safe. The gigantic hill: Dozens of Jackson residents have been evacuated after land began shifting on a hillside in the Wyoming resort town . More work needed: Assistant Town Manager Roxanne Robinson said there is still no word on what is causing the East Gros Ventre Butte land to shift . Top of the hill: Visible cracks have formed in the hillside above the cliff and the Walgreens in the hillside town of Jackson in Wyoming. Residents have been evacuated, with fears teh giant hill (pictured) could further  crumble and crack, causing a landslide . Close up: Authorities from geologists say the earth movement on East Gros Ventre Butte (pictured) is deeper and more dangerous than previously believed . Risky: Authorities say this home located at the top of the hill could be in danger if the slope cracks further. The power has been turned off and the home evacuated . A road and parking lot of a Walgreens pharmacy have been distorted and buckled by ground movement, which was also the cause of breaks in nearby water pipes last weekend. A slope several inches deep has ripped the hillside above the pharmacy, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported today. Councilman Jim Stanford, who toured one of the damaged houses yesterday, said it is 'trashed' inside. Hillslide: Residents Budge Drive, the Walgreens apartments and commercial businesses (Walgreens pictured) in the Hillside Complex in Wyoming have been evacuated after a giant hill began to crumble yesterday . Unstable: This image shows how much the ground has shifted near the Walgreens building located near the crumbling hill. It is not known when the evacuees will be allowed to return home because the area is still very unstable . Announcement: Wyoming Homeland Security announced on twitter that the American Red Cross of Wyoming was ready to help evacuees . He said the living room is sloped downhill. In the kitchen, the planks of the wooden floor are coming apart, and cabinets have fallen off the wall. Robinson said experts tell town officials there is no danger like the mudslide on March 22 that killed at least 35 people in Washington state because Jackson residents had plenty of time to evacuate. 'Part of the hillside could come down, but there would not be a catastrophe,' she said.

Vance McAllister (left), a conservative Republican congressman from Louisiana who got caught kissing a staffer recently, is seeking the advice of Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson (right). Robertson was invited to the State of the Union Address in January by McAllister . McAllister had been in seclusion in his Louisiana district since the video of McAllister and a female staffer kissing in his district office was leaked on Monday. He has said he has no plans to resign. McAllister and Robertson, who is CEO of the highly successful duck call maker Duck Commander, are not strangers. When McAlister was running for his seat last year,  he sought — and received — and endorsement from Mr. Robertson. Some pundits believe the endorsement of Robertson and other members of the Robertson family was critical to his political success, according to abcnews.com.

"By . Alex Greig . An obese man has been rescued from his Florida home by dozens of firefighters after falling and being trapped in his own home for more than 24 hours. Palm Beach County Fire Rescue's bariatric unit removed the man, who weighs more than 500lbs, after devising a plan to enter the home, which was too cluttered to fit the team and stretcher. Fire crews cut a hole in the back of the 63-year-old man's home and laid wooden planks on the ground from the home to the ambulance for the special stretcher bearing the man. Scroll down for video . Coordinated rescue: Fire crews lay down wooden planks for the stretcher bearing the obese man . 'We have one special unit in Palm Beach County that can handle patients that weigh up to 1,000lbs,' Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Public Information Officer Captain Albert Borroto told WPTV. The man's best friend told reporters that the man called him for help Wednesday after he realized he was unable to get up. 'He called me this morning because he couldn't get up, and he couldn't get a hold of anyone else, said Don Estess. According to Fox8, the man fell Tuesday and was unable to move until the fire crews arrived.

The final Corvette was pulled from the depths of a sinkhole at a Kentucky museum on Wednesday, but it was barely recognizable to its owner. The 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 was . buried in dirt and rocks, deep beneath the surface of the National . Corvette Museum in Bowling Green. The rescue of its mangled remains completed weeks of painstaking work to retrieve eight classic cars that were gobbled up by the gaping hole. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rescue operation: Workers pull out a car from the sinkhole at the National Corvette Museum, in Bowling Green, Kentucky . The mood was somber as the crumpled car, . which boasted 700 horsepower thanks to performance enhancements, was . pulled to the surface. 'It looks like a piece of tin foil,' said . Kevin Helmintoller, of Land O' Lakes, Florida, who donated the car to . the museum last December. 'I'm still glad I'm here, because I would have . never believed it was this bad. I'm not positive I would have . recognized it.' At around the time it was donated, the car was appraised at $125,000 because of the performance modifications, said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. The cars looked like toys piled in a heap amid dirt and concrete fragments after the 40-foot-wide-by-60-foot-deep sinkhole opened beneath a museum display area in mid-February. It happened when the museum was closed, and no one was injured. The other cars that took the plunge were a 1962 black Corvette, a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder, a 1984 PPG Pace Car, a 1992 White 1 Millionth Corvette, a 2009 white 1.5 Millionth Corvette, a 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil and a 1993 Ruby Red 40th Anniversary Corvette. The eight cars are widely believed to have a total value exceeding $1 million, the museum said. Sinkholes are common in the Bowling Green area, which is located amid a large region of bedrock . The first car was pulled out of the hole in March and suffered relatively minor damage . The museum owned six of the cars, and the other two — the ZR-1 Spyder and ZR1 Blue Devil — were on loan from General Motors. Sinkholes are common in the Bowling Green area, which is located amid a large region of bedrock known as karst where many of Kentucky's largest and deepest caves run underground. With the retrieval now complete, the next task is to assess which cars are repairable. 'They seem to run the gamut — from very minor or superficial damage to catastrophic damage,' said Monte Doran, a spokesman for Chevrolet, which will oversee restoration of the cars in Michigan. The first car hoisted out in early March — the ZR1 Blue Devil — suffered only minor damage that included cracks on lower door panels, a busted window and a ruptured oil line. Workers got that car running, and cheers went up as the engine revved. The mood turned more dour as the damage became progressively worse as each car was pulled out. The white 1.5 Millionth Corvette recovered recently was flattened by the weight of debris. The ZR-1 Spyder and the PPG Pace Car, also among the final cars retrieved, sustained considerable damage as well, Frassinelli said. Unstable: Five of the damaged iconic cars were owned by the museum and the other three by General Motors, but staff managed to remove an irreplaceable 1983 Corvette from the facility . Significant damage: When security arrived they discovered a sinkhole 40 feet wide and 30 feet deep with the iconic vehicles at the bottom. The one millionth Corvette, which was donated to the museum by Chevrolet, was among the cars that fell into the sinkhole . We have an opening: A helicopter drone was used to survey the devastation left after a giant sinkhole opened up and swallowed some vintage Corvettes at the National Corvette Museum in Kentucky . All eight cars will be on display at the museum through August. The decisions about which ones to repair and which are too damaged to fix will be heart-wrenching. 'That's going to be a fairly difficult discussion,' Doran said. Whether repair crews can retain the authenticity of each classic car will be a big factor, officials said. 'It would be fairly easy to go find another white 2009 Corvette and take as many parts off that car and put them onto a new structure with the VIN number of this (original) car,' Doran said. 'You start splitting the line of — did we restore the 1.5 millionth car or did we build an all-new car.' Cars considered too badly damaged won't go on the scrap heap. Publicity surrounding the massive sinkhole has led to an attendance boost at the museum . 'I'm sure that we'll continue to display them as is. It's now a part of museum and Corvette history,' Frassinelli said. 'It's interesting to people. They aren't going into storage somewhere.' The museum has remained open, except for the area where the sinkhole occurred, and the publicity has led to an attendance boost. Attendance in March was up 56 percent from the same month a year ago, Frassinelli said. Publicity surrounding the massive sinkhole has led to an attendance boost at the museum. Repairs to the museum, which is near the factory where the iconic Corvettes are made, are expected to be completed by early August, ahead of the museum's late summer Corvette Caravan — a celebration marking the museum's 20th anniversary. Thousands of Corvette enthusiasts are expected to converge in their models of the classic American sports car.","The 700hp 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 was buried in dirt and rocks .

Katheryn Deprill appeared beside her biological mother, Cathy Pochek, and her adoptive mother, Brenda Hollis, on the Today show on Thursday morning for their first interview together. Deprill, who found Kathy after launching a Facebook appeal last month, learned her mother was just 16 when she left her in the Pennsylvania bathroom following a rape that she hid from her family. After seeing the news stories about Deprill's search, Pocheck contacted a lawyer and the two women met two weeks later. They soon realized they have a long list of things in common - from their names, cars and careers. Bizarrely, Pochek even babysat Deprill's husband when he was a child. Scroll down for video . Overwhelmed: Katheryn Deprill breaks down in tears as she describes how she was reunited with her birth mother 27 years after she abandoned her in a Burger King bathroom as a newborn . Together: Deprill found her birth mother Cathy Pochek, left, after launching an appeal on Facebook . 'It's so surreal,' Deprill said as she became emotional on the Today show. 'I never in a million years thought this was going to happen so I don't think i necessarily prepared myself for it.' Of the moment they met in an attorney's office, Deprill said: 'It was very exciting, there were lots of emotions. And it was kind of awkward. I said, ""Alright, just give me the hug."" That broke the ice.' Until that moment, something had been missing, she said. 'I have a wonderful family, I would never want to replace them. But being adopted, part of you is missing,' she said. Pocheck said she had contacted a lawyer to help her meet Deprill because she was worried someone else would take advantage of the situation. Support: They were also joined on the Today show by Deprill's adoptive mother, Brenda Hollis, right . Emotional: Hollis said she encouraged her daughter to turn to Facebook to find her birth mother last month . 'I was extremely nervous,' she said. 'I had the advantage because I had seen interviews she had done. I was so proud of her, how articulate she was... I was grateful for her mom for the beautiful childhood that she gave her.' She added to her daughter: 'I'm really glad you came looking for me.' When the women met, they were also . overwhelmed by their similarities. They share the same name - Katheryn . Ann, although spelled differently - both drive the same make and color . of car, and both work as ENTs. 'She . actually was the babysitter of my husband,' Deprill added. 'They lived . in the same town. So she knew my husband before I did.' Appeal: Deprill posted this image on Facebook on March 2 and it was shared more than 30,000 times . Deprill's adoptive mother, Brenda . Hollis, said that she had always supported her daughter's desire to . track down her biological mother. 'She been talking about it for a long time,' she said. 'Never in a million years did we expect this to happen.' A massive search was launched to find . Deprill's mother 27 years ago after a customer found the newborn wrapped . in a sweater and dumped in the Burger King, which is still . standing in Allentown. Deprill was about three hours old when she was found and she was adopted by a local foster family. Investigators dusted for fingerprints, . searched trash cans, interviewed witnesses and followed up on seemingly . promising tips - but nothing led them to the mother. Abandoned: It emerged that Deprill (pictured) was abandoned after her birth mother was raped aged 16 . Discovery: She was found on the floor of the bathroom in this Burger King in Allentown, Pennsylvania . She eventually went on to marry, work as an emergency medical technician and have three children of her own. Deprill began her quest for her mother on March 2, when she posted an image on her Facebook page showing her holding a sign. 'Looking for my birth mother,' it read. 'She abandoned me in the Burger King bathroom only hours old, Allentown PA. Please help me find her by sharing my post.' The photo was shared more than 30,000 times by Facebook users around the world, and Deprill's story landed in numerous media outlets. That caught the attention of the woman claiming to have abandoned her, and she came forward to attorney John Waldron, who arranged for them to meet. Childhood: She was brought up by Brenda Hollis, left, and her husband and always knew she was adopted . Making up for lost time: The two women, who both have families, now hope to stay in touch . She explained that, as a 16-year-old girl, she was raped by a stranger  while traveling abroad with her family and became pregnant. She said she hid the pregnancy from her parents because she was ashamed and, when she gave birth at home, felt she could not take her newborn to the hospital.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Holly Hewett from Kent, whose mobile phone caught fire while it was on charge . A woman narrowly escaped serious injury after she woke up to find her mobile phone had caught fire while charging. Holly Hewett from Kelmsley in Kent was woken by a ‘sizzling sound’ and the smell of burning. She looked down and saw her Samsung Galaxy S4 smouldering as it charged on the carpeted floor. At the risk of being burnt, she grabbed the smartphone, ran to the bathroom and threw it in the sink. The 25-year-old said: ‘I’ve never had anything like this happen to me before. ‘It had only been charging for about 50 minutes. Even though it was dark I could smell the smoke. ‘I picked it up and the screen sparked. As I walked to the bathroom the battery fell out of the casing at the back onto the floor. I didn’t burn myself but there’s a hole in the carpet where it scorched it.’ Miss Hewett then grabbed the smartphone and ran to the bathroom and threw it in the sink. The civil servant added: 'I woke up at 4.30am when my boyfriend got up to go to work and looked at my phone to check the time. 'I noticed it was running low on battery so I plugged it in and put it on charge. 'At about 5am I checked the time again then rolled over and went back to sleep, but within about 10 minutes of that I heard a sizzling sound. 'Even though it was dark I could smell the smoke. I picked it up and the screen sparked. 'As I walked to the bathroom the battery fell out of the casing at the back onto the floor. 'I didn’t burn myself but there’s a hole in the carpet where it scorched it. The smell was awful, so I opened a window.' She added: 'I was on my own and panicked because I’d got no house phone so I didn’t know how to contact anyone to let them know what had happened. Miss Hewett said the phone had only been charging for 50 minutes before catching alight . 'My boyfriend’s brother is about a five-minute drive away, but I kept thinking ‘it’s too early’. 'In the end, after unplugging everything, I drove to my dad’s house.' This is not the first time Samsung products have apparently set alight – last year a man posted a video on YouTube showing the damage to his Samsung Galaxy S4 when it caught fire while charging. He also claimed Samsung ordered him to remove the footage before they would replace it. A Samsung spokesman said: ‘Once we have received the product in question, we will conduct a thorough examination to determine the exact cause of the incident.

"By . James Gordon . An elderly from Utah has been ordered to serve at least 15 years in prison for the murder of his wife in 2011. Charles Edward Dodd, 78, pleaded guilty, but mentally ill, to one count of murder. Dodd admitted to stabbing his 10th wife, Mary W. Ratliffe, three times in the heart in August 2011. After killing her, he took a large amount of prescription drugs and drank a tumbler of vodka before stabbing himself in the chest and losing consciousness. Jailed: Charles Edward Dodd, 78, (pictured at an earlier court hearing) has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the death of his ill wife. He tried to commit suicide after killing her. He has now been sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in jail . Wife number ten: Mary W. Ratliffe is shown in the photo her family submitted for her obituary. Ratliffe, 82, was stabbed to death on August 13, 2011. Her husband, Charles Edward Dodd, has been found guilty of murder . Off to prison: Charles Edward Dodd has been sentenced to serve at least 15 years in prison for the 2011 murder of his wife . Investigators learned of Ratliffe's death and Dodd's suicide attempt after an acquaintance notified them that Dodd had left two envelopes at her office containing $7,000 in cash and two notes indicating that he intended to kill his wife and himself. 'In the note he wrote he said he didn't want Mary taken from him,' Ratliffe's daughter, Connie Pearson told KSL news. She described him 'anxious and worried about every little thing' in the months before the murder. The killing happened before the couple were dues to move to Houston. They were a couple for 20 years and had been married for 10. Both had health problems, according to Pearson. He suffered from a condition that left his lips blue from a lack of oxygen. She . had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite her medical . condition, Pearson said her mother was healthy and active. She dismissed . Dodd's claims to detectives that her mother was an invalid who wanted . to die. This wasn't a mercy killing. This was murder,' she said. Issues over Dodd's competency to stand trial led to several delays in the case. It was no mercy killing: Mary W. Ratliffe's daughter has been critical of the way the case was handled by the Duchesne County Attorney's Office. Her primary complaints center on the length of time it took to reach a resolution in the case and a lack of communication from prosecutors . He was committed to the Utah State Hospital for at least a year and underwent three separate psychological examinations. When Dodd woke up in his hospital bed shortly after the murder, he said he wanted to 'plead guilty to the charge straight up, be sent to the (state prison) and have them put a bullet in his head,' defense attorney Bill Morrison said. As a result of that statement, the medical examiner found Dodd incompetent to stand trial. Pearson said she had hoped that Dodd would have been eligible for the death penalty. However, given his age though and the 15-to-life sentence he received, she said that he will likely die behind bars. 'I'm still going through the various levels of grief,' Pearson said. 'Right now, I can't forgive him. (My mother) was an inspiration to me.' Dodd will begin serving his sentence at the state hospital before being moved to the state prison.","Charles Edward Dodd, 78, has been ordered to serve at least 15 years in prison for the 2011 murder of his wife .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A diabetic sufferer in Iowa has trained his own pet to alert him to changes in his blood sugar levels after being told it would cost $25,000 for a medical assistance dog. When Robert McVey had Type 2 diabetes diagnosed in 2012 his doctor suggested using a specially trained dog, but with a hefty price tag it wasn't an option he could afford. Instead, he and his wife Lesli brought an adorable Labrador cross Weimaraner called Austin that they have trained themselves. Life saver: Robert McVey with Austin the dog that he trained to alert him to changes in his blood sugar levels . 'I thought that I had trained dogs in obedience before, why can’t I train my own diabetic alert dog?' Mr McVey told the Des Moines Register. Dogs have more than 200,000 sensors in their nose which help them detect tiny changes in a human. When a diabetic's blood sugar level drops, the change can be detected by the dogs through the person's sweat and breath. If a diabetic alert assistance dog detects those changes it will alert its owner in one of several ways, such as tapping them with a paw, or sitting directly in front of them. While the dogs are no replacement for medication or devices used to control and monitor diabetes, they play a valuable role in early detection, which can also boost the patient's confidence. 'Technically anybody can do it; it’s just the time commitment,' he added. Like other diabetic alert medical assistance dogs, Austin is able to detect the tiny changes in Mr McVey that show his blood sugar levels are low. The dog then touches its owner with its paw, to let them know they need to take an insulin injection. Training Austin to spot the symptoms started when he was just a puppy, and began with basic commands most people teach their pets. 'The obedience and everything is the . same. You still start with that and make sure they have their obedience. As far as the scent training and things, you start them off very . early,' Mrs McVey told Fox News. For the scent training, Austin was taught to detect saliva samples taken from patients with high or low blood sugar. As well as training at home, Austin and his owners flew to Seattle for a four-day intensive workshop to improve his skills. Dog school: Robert works on a training session with Austin . Smell of success: Samples of saliva are hidden in tubes to teach Austin to detect changes in blood sugar levels . It wasn't long before Austin's training . paid off. In January Mr McVey had been working outside on his car, and . had missed a meal. When he walked inside Austin immediately tapped him . with his paw to warn that his blood sugar level was low. After their success with Austin, the McVeys realized they could use their experience to train other dogs to help patients who, like them, would struggle to pay for a more expensive dog. They recently brought home a new addition to the family - Rouge - who will go from wriggling pup to life-saver in just under a year. The couple have also set up DADs Paws 4 Life, which they are applying to have listed as a non-profit group, so they can expand their training program. New recruit: The McVeys are training a second pup, Rouge, for other diabetic patients . While the dogs are no replacement for devices that monitor sugar levels for diabetics, they work as an invaluable early-warning system. The dogs are capable of letting their owners know about changes in nearly every situation, and will even wake a sleeping diabetic if they detect a drop in sugar levels. 'This early alert to shifts in blood sugar is a huge relief to diabetics and parents of diabetics struggling to identify such changes before they result in uncomfortable symptoms,' the McVeys said.","Labrador-cross named Austin can spot drop in blood sugar levels .

"By . Jonathan Block . Tie, the dog that chased a commuter train heading into Manhattan from the Bronx on Tuesday, will be put up for adoption on Friday unless his owner claims him before then. Late Tuesday morning, an engineer on a southbound Metro-North train spotted the Collie-Shepherd mix near a train yard in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx, DNAinfo reported. Tie, who is thought to be about three, then ran with the train all the way down to the 125th St. station in the Harlem section of Manhattan, a distance about a mile and a half away. Tie — named after railroad ties in between train tracks —was running on a track parallel to the one the train was on, according to the New York Post. A couple of times, the dog fell between the ties, but managed to get up and continue racing. Tie, the Collie Shepherd mix that tried to out-run a Metro-North commuter train Tuesday morning . Some of the MTA police officers who scooped up Tie after he ran on the tracks from the Bronx to a station in Harlem . 'He was just running like she didn’t have a care in the world,' the train's engineer, Joseph Delia, said. 'The dog was in front of me, running in front,' said Delia, an dog lover himself, who alerted the Metro-North command center and police. 'Oh, my God, I was going real slow.' He added he was concerned the dog would get hurt. 'She’s not a very big dog.' Delia said. 'I was worried she wouldn’t make it and get electrocuted.' Tie is in the custody of Animal Care & Control of NYC as they try to locate her owner . If Tie's owner does not come forward by Friday, the dog will be put up for adoption . When the train arrived at the 125th St. station, two Metropolitan Transit Authority officers and a Metro-north employee were waiting to scoop him up. When they started going down to reach Tie, he came to them. 'If the owner doesn’t claim the dog hopefully I’ll be on the list to adopt her,' said MTA officer Luis Alvarez, who rescued the dog with his partner Errold Borges. 'I have three girls, they are all texting me to get the dog.' The dog was then placed in the care on Animal Care & Control of NYC, a local shelter, who checked to see if Tie had a mocrochip implanted in him, but did not. However, given Tie's behavior and physical appearance, shelter officials think he has an owner who takes very good care of her. 'She looks very well cared for and very well fed,' Risa Weinstock of Animal Care & Control said. 'She did a lot of tricks and knows a lot of commands, that’s not something you learn on the street.'

"By . Ruth Styles . With Princess Beatrice, the Princess Royal and Pippa Middleton among her clients, milliner Rosie Olivia is no stranger to designing hats for well-bred wearers. But her latest venture, an unusual photo shoot to mark the start of Aintree, sees her creations appear on well-bred models of an entirely different sort. Strutting their stuff for the camera is a succession of equine stars, most of whom appear happy - if bemused - to find themselves swapping head collars for hats. Dapper: Lovely though this cobalt straw cap is, its equine wearer seems less than impressed . Looking good! A glamorous dapple grey sports an elaborate hot pink bloom enlivened with delicate crystals . Highlights include a spectacular gold glittery fascinator topped with a lime bow and modelled by a handsome chestnut, and a pink silk number worn by a bored-looking dapple grey. So good did the equine models look in the hats, milliner Rosie Olivia, who described the shoot as 'brilliantly bizarre', said the horses would be in with an excellent chance of triumphing in the style stakes come Ladies' Day on Friday. 'I spend my days creating weird and . wonderful designs for fashion-forward ladies, but never did I think I'd . be styling my hats on models of the four-legged variety,' she revealed. 'It . was a brilliantly bizarre day, but I think they all look fabulous and . are definitely a contender for the most stylish appearance this racing . season.' Neigh! A disgruntled looking equine model sports a floppy straw number enlivened with pheasant feathers . Glossy: A Dartmoor pony swaps the field for the catwalk in an elaborate pink floral fascinator . Not too keen: This horse appears distinctly unamused with the feather and straw creation perched on his head . Sparkling: This glossy chestnut model looks lovely in his gold glittering fascinator topped with a lime bow . The unusual photo shoot was the brainchild of local portrait company Venture Photography, which set up a mobile studio at the Red House Stables in Warrington, Cheshire, where the shoot took place. 'I've not photographed a horse wearing a designer hat before,' admitted Richard Mayfield, creative director of Venture Photography, 'and it's safe to say I probably won't do so again!' Although the equine stars of the shoot probably won't get the chance to show off their hats at Aintree, Rosie Olivia's designs are likely to get an airing at the race meeting. Last year, hats by the milliner, which can cost up to £400, were spotted on scores of racegoers, and have also proved a hit with Princess Beatrice who has been photographed in Rosie Olivia on numerous occasions, including a bespoke creation worn for the Christmas Day service at Sandringham.

Aspen's parents, Jill and Dominic, both aged 34, are keen snowboarders but they admit their daughter will be running rings around them in the snow in a few years time. Mrs Haight said: 'We are very proud of her. I was a competitive snowboarder when I was younger, and my husband was my coach, so snowboarding is in her blood. 'Aspen was 10 months old when we put her on a snowboard without bindings, as soon as she could walk. The toddler, from Colorado, has a custom-made board and even tested the world's smallest pair of ski boots during one of her now frequent visits to the slopes . 'There's a great system in place here for little kids as the smallest boards come equipped with traction pads and 'riglet reels'. 'Aspen started out just standing on the board and we would pull her around the house, this helped tremendously in her having outstanding balance once we put her in bindings and on the snow at 14 months. 'We try and get her out riding at least twice a week or as often as we can.' 'We try and get her out riding at least twice a week or as often as we can,' said her parents . Mrs Haight said: 'She's becoming something of an internet star and it's amazing that people around the world are seeing Aspen snowboard' The proud mother posted videos of her daughter's first appearance on the slopes online and has received messages from people around the world who are astonished at Aspen's snowboarding ability. Mrs Haight added: 'She's becoming something of an internet star and it's amazing that people around the world are seeing Aspen snowboard. 'She gets so much attention locally as well. We can't take her riding without people recognising her and stopping us to take her picture. 'Every parent thinks their kid is special, but when you have people around the world confirming that, its quite an incredible feeling. Her parents believe she 'definitely has a future in snowboarding, especially since the pros are getting younger and younger these days' Mrs Haight said: 'She's becoming something of an internet star and it's amazing that people around the world are seeing Aspen snowboard' 'As far as other sports, Aspen loves to play in the snow but she's getting pretty good at shooting a basketball too. 'I definitely think she has a future in snowboarding, especially since the pros are getting younger and younger these days. 'She truly loves it, and being outdoors. 'If she didn't like it we wouldn't force it on her.

"By . Darren Boyle . Meet the world’s biggest celeb spotter who has had his photo taken with over 5,000 famous faces. Over the last 50 years, celebrity hunter Gary Watson, 67, has trawled the globe in search of the world’s biggest A listers and has been photographed with everyone from John Lennon to Nelson Mandela. The former policeman, who refers to himself as ‘The World famous Gary G Watson’ was first inspired to become a celeb spotter after meeting the late Martin Luther King Jr in New York City when he was 20-years-old. Mr Watson did not have a camera with him on the day he met Mr King and vowed that he would always carry one in future to capture those historic moments. Gary has spent more than 40 years getting photographed with the world's most famous people from sporting legends, actors and even US presidents including Muhammed Ali . One of Mr Watson's proudest moments was meeting Nelson Mandela . Gary Watson said it is his warm personality that has allowed him to get photographed with 5,000 stars such as George Clooney . He talked his way into every star-studded event he could and spent hours waiting outside hotels and conventions in his search for famous faces. At first his unusual hobby was met with looks of bemusement from paparazzi and news reporters alike. But it soon earnt him some friends in high-places and it wasn’t long before he was getting tip offs and event tickets with access to the hottest names in showbiz. Mr Watson now has a collection of over 5000 photographs of himself with celebrities including the likes of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Michael Jackson, Bill Clinton and George Clooney amongst thousands of others. Feeling lucky, Mr Watson managed to meet Dirty Harry star Clint Eastwood . It is not just film stars and politicians that interest the former policeman, who is photographed here with Microsoft founder Bill Gates . Here the 67-year-old celebrity hunter is photographed alongside Grace Kelly . He said: 'When I first started taking my picture with celebrities, the paparazzi thought I was crazy, but I showed them a different way of doing things. 'Some of them noticed that I had a way of stopping celebs in the street, so they would let me through the crowds as they knew they would be able to get their picture if I got a chance to speak to them.' One of his most prized possessions is a photograph with former Beatle John Lennon . 'They were all there in the hope of taking a picture they could sell but I wanted something truly unique, something that would set myself apart from all the photographers and that I could call my own. 'Many of their photographs were missing an important human element that you just can’t reproduce, my pictures really capture the happiness of the moment.' Mr Watson puts his success with the stars down to his open, friendly and most importantly polite nature. He says he always dresses in a suit for his celeb encounters as a sign of respect. From his humble beginnings, Mr Watson has managed to talk his way into some of the most exclusive celebrity events on the planet including the 1978 Academy awards, the Night of 100 Stars on three separate occasions, the TONY awards 11 times and was even given tickets to the 1985 Grammy Awards by iconic crooner, Frank Sinatra. His obsession with the rich and famous first began as a child growing up in New York City and used the local movie theatre as a way of escaping the domestic violence he would encounter at home. It’s fair to say that it wasn’t long before Mr Watson fell in love with some of the classiest and coolest characters the silver screen had to offer and even emulates his own appearance on the UK’s slickest super spy, James Bond. Mr Watson has travelled the globe tracking down his next celebrity including former President Bill Clinton . Mr Watson began his obsession after meeting Martin Luther King aged 20, here he is with former president George Bush . Mr Watson was thrilled to meet music legend Michael Jackson . However, rubbing shoulders with the stars doesn’t come easy, and Gary has spent hundreds of hours waiting outside various hotels and conventions for that once in a lifetime opportunity, not to mention the thousands spent in travelling costs. Mr Watson is writing a book about his life tracking down celebrities such as James Brown . But despite Mr Watson’s astonishing super star line up, he admits there’s a few big names missing, such as President Barack Obama, actor Christopher Lee and actress Sandra Bullock who he vows to one day meet to complete his phenomenal portfolio. He said 'I have met a lot of people in my time who have had thousands of pictures with celebrities but I have never seen or known of anyone that can compete with my collection. 'What makes my collection so unique, is its diversity, I have met some of the most iconic people on the planet from all walks of life, some of which some are sadly no longer with us. 'I want to prove to people that many celebrities are just genuinely great people who are more than happy to talk to their fans, but it is all about how you approach them. 'If they can see you are a genuine fan of their work and you are friendly and polite and come looking smart and respectful that holds a lot of weight, first impressions count. 'I will talk and hold a conversation with anyone from, I am never intimidated by their fame as I believe it’s fans like me that have helped shape their careers. 'Sure there is a lot of time waiting outside hotels and at conventions and sometimes I even walk away empty handed but I just think ‘I’ve got to try just once’ otherwise it’s an opportunity I might never get again.' Here Mr Watson managed to track down singer Miley Cyrus . Watson, Gary Watson meets 007 star Sean Connery . Mr Watson said he wants to prove to people that celebrities such as Tom Hanks are just like ordinary people . Mr Watson said he has never felt intimidated meeting people such as Mother Teresa . He added: 'I feel lucky in that I’ve connected with something that I have genuine passion for, I come alive when I talk about my hobby and as people pass away my photographs remind me how special these moments were and how lucky I was to meet people who were at the top of their chosen field. 'I’ll carry on having my picture taken with extraordinary people for as long as I possibly can, it keeps me feeling young. 'There are still a few who have slipped through the net over the years, I think I’d most like to meet President Barack Obama, he’s the top guy on my list.' Watson, who lives in Philadelphia, is writing a book outlining his success. Showing the range of celebrities who have agreed to be photographed alongside Mr Watson are Malala Yousafzai (left) who was shot by the Taliban in Pakistan for wanting to go to school and Hollywood star Bruce Dern (right) Robert Downey looks every bit of his junior tag in this early photograph with Mr Watson . Mr Watson is writing a book to tell the world about his exploits with celebrities such as British actor Gerard Butler . While Mr Watson  may not have changed over the years, some of the stars such as Johnny Depp look far more 'mature' Some of those who Mr Watson has photographed such as Chiwetel Ejiofor have only recently hit the big time . Among the stars who agreed to pose with Mr Watson was Selena Gomez . Mr Watson believes meeting celebrities such as John Wayne (left) and Michael Caine (right) keeps him feeling young . They haven't often been on screen at the same time but Gary Watson managed to get Robert De Niro (left) and Al Pacino (right) into the same photograph as himself .

"By . John Hall . A group of Honduran migrants who lost arms and legs falling from dangerous people trafficking trains have asked Mexico to allow them free passage to travel the U.S. border without documents. About a dozen migrants say they petitioned the Mexican Senate earlier in the week, asking for the the government to stop persecuting Central Americans, protect them from criminal gangs, and help fund new shelters for them to stay in as they make their way towards the U.S. The migrants say that drug gang members and other criminals frequently beat, stab or push them from moving trains during their journeys through Mexico to the United States. Injured: Norman Saul Varela, 46, is one of the Honduran migrants invovled in the campaign. He uses a prosthetic leg after losing his limb while riding the train through Mexico toward the U.S. border . Hope: The 11 migrants (pictured) say they petitioned the Mexican Senate earlier in the week, asking for the the government to stop persecuting Central Americans, protect them from criminal gangs . Fear: The migrants say that drug gang members and other criminals frequently beat, stab or push them from moving trains during their journeys through Mexico to the United States . The migrants wore prosthetic limbs - in some cases, for both legs - and pinned-up shirt sleeves in place of missing arms. They expressed hope that Mexico would agree to allow them transit visas or free passage without documents to cross the country on their way to the U.S. border. Jose Luis Hernandez, the leader of the Association of Disabled Returning Migrants, said the group hopes to meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto to discuss their demands. Hernandez said there are 452 badly injured migrants from Honduras alone, and more from other Central American countries. 'We have hit bottom... It is no longer even news when two people die on 'The Beast,' or that somebody fell under the train and lost his legs,' Hernandez said, referring to the train that travels through southern Mexico that migrants call La Bestia. Victims: Armando Diaz Mendoza, 50, (left) Jeremias Gamez, 41, (right) are both migrants from Honduras who use prosthetic legs after falling from trains travelling through Mexico toward the U.S. border . Travel: They badly inured migrants expressed hope that Mexico would agree to allow them transit visas or free passage without documents to cross the country on their way to the U.S. border . Criminal gangs often board the trains to rob migrants, many of whom have relatives in the United States. They are sometimes kidnapped and held until their families send ransom payments. The migrants are often afraid to report such crimes for fear they will be deported, and some accuse police in Mexico of turning detained migrants over to the gangs, or robbing them themselves. Hernandez said migrants believe that railway employees work with criminal gangs by slowing down to allow them to board the trains. 'There is a plot that involves the engineers and the railway guards, it's all about extorting money from the migrants, he said. A criminal complaint filed last week by prosecutors in the southern Mexico state of Veracruz alleges that railway companies or their employees have been complicit in crimes committed against migrants riding their trains. Ferrosur, a Mexican rail line, and KCSM, a subsidiary of the U.S. railway Kansas City Southern, noted that migrants board their trains illegally, and said they were doing everything to cooperate with authorities. 'The guidelines of KCSM state that security personnel must respect the physical safety of those who travel illegally on the trains,"" the company said in a statement. Ferrosur said it 'provided full cooperation' with Mexican immigration agents. But Hernandez said immigration agents shouldn't be pursuing migrants who don't want to stay in Mexico and only wish to reach the United States. Jose Vazquez, 33, (right) lost a leg in 2005 while riding the train through Mexico. Fredy Vegas, 33, (left) suffered the same injury making the same journey . Organised crime: Gangs often board the trains to rob migrants, many of whom have relatives in the United States. They are sometimes kidnapped and held until their families send ransom payments . In 2008, Mexico removed rarely enforced criminal penalties of 18 months to 10 years in prison for migrants in the country illegally. Being an undocumented migrant is now a minor offense punishable by fines, although most migrants are been deported. Rather than deportation, Hernandez's group is calling on Mexico to provide transit visas to guarantee safe passage of central American migrants through the country - something THAT Mexican Congresswoman Amalia Garcia claims is possible, albeit with a few legal changes. Hernandez also said migrants want federal police officers aboard the trains - not to catch migrants, but to protect them from criminals. He also expressed hope that Mexico's government would help support migrant shelters, most of them run by Roman Catholic relief and charity organizations. uch shelters could have made the difference for Hernandez, who lost an arm, a leg and part of his other hand when he fainted and fell on the tracks in the northern state of Chihuahua in 2005 after 20 days of riding the train, not eating and hiding from police. Senator Gabriela Cuevas, who met with the migrants, said that Mexico should give migrants the same kind of protections it demands from the United States when Mexicans are deported. 'We are no model of what we demand from the United States... It would be nice of Mexico could become an example of what we are demanding,' she said.","Badly injured migrants ask Mexican Senate to protect them from gangs .

"By . Mark Duell . A disgruntled farmer was so frustrated at the recent cold snap that he wrote 'Where is Spring?' in 40ft-high letters on his snow-covered fields. Beef farmer Nicholas Stokes, 57, used his quad bike to etch out the giant letters on his land in Ellesmere, Shropshire, as temperatures plunged to -4C over the Easter weekend. Mr Stokes, who has lived on the farm all his life, said: 'This is the worst spell of freezing weather I have ever known and it's coming off the back of months of persistent rain. Frustration: Beef farmer Nicholas Stokes, 57, used his quad bike to etch out the giant letters on his land in Ellesmere, Shropshire, as temperatures plunged to -4C over the Easter weekend . Change in the weather? People make their way along the Long Walk near Windsor Castle in Berkshire in the sunshine, despite temperatures staying cold . 'When I saw the snow covering my field I . just thought I wanted to do something to show my frustration at the . situation in a humorous way. It was just a bit of fun. Everyone keeps . wondering what on earth happened to spring this year. I thought I would . spell it out for everyone to see.' After spending 30 minutes writing the huge message, Mr Stokes, who has 50 cattle, flew on his microlight aircraft to snap his handiwork. But long-awaited spring weather is finally expected to arrive this weekend with temperatures set to return to normal, following the coldest March in more than 50 years. Those in the south will see temperatures up to 10C, only just below typical April averages, with sunshine spreading across the UK - but there will also be unsettled weather including flurries of rain. MeteoGroup forecaster Matt Dobson said: ‘There's definitely a change on the way. We'll notice it next week more than anything, with temperatures returning to normal. Saturday looks like a lovely day for the south. ‘Cold but plenty of sunshine around, although there will be a frosty start. By the end of Saturday it could get up to 10C in the south, which is a few degrees warmer than we have seen and just below the average for April. ‘In the north it will still be fairly cold even on Saturday with rain and sleet about. Temperatures are on the up but the weather won't be that nice. It is turning less cold with temperatures returning to normal but with that rise we'll have lots of rain.’ Seeing red: A heat lamp keeps a one-day-old lamb warm at Gwndwnwal Farm in Brecon, mid-Wales . Damage: A housing association workman mowed over a daffodil display (left) worth hundreds of pounds in Easington, North Yorkshire. Easington Resident's Association member Gordon Davis, 80, is also pictured (right) Average temperatures across the UK will reach 7C to 8C on Saturday, rising to 9C on Sunday and could continue to rise during the week, according to the Met Office. Temperatures will nearly hit 11C, the average maximum temperature for April nationally, but will still be a few degrees away from the London average of 12C. Dan Williams, of the Met Office, said: ‘What we'll see is temperatures going much closer to the average but we'll see more unsettled weather with it, about with some brighter, drier spells.’ Farmers today called for the right to bury hundreds of sheep and ponies killed by the heavy snow. European Union rules mean farmers must send the bodies of animals to collection centres for disposal - but reaching the dead is a difficult task when having to content with huge snow drifts. Their call came as Britain woke up this morning to the news that temperatures are not expected to break into double figures this week and the weather will continue to be sub-zero overnight. Three-day forecast: While the next few days are expected to be sunny, temperatures will not breach 9C . Farmer Gareth Wyn Jones, of . Llanfairfechan, North Wales, who is secretary of the local Carneddau . Pony Society, said: ‘Under EU legislation we are not allowed to bury . them. It’s ridiculous. Two German teenagers are stranded in the Highlands after their van became stuck in snow two weeks ago. Oliver . Suft, 19, and Julia Kumschier, 19, of Bavaria, were inspired to visit . Scotland for the first time after watching 007 film Skyfall, which has . its climax set in the Highlands. The . couple travelled to the slopes of Ben Lawers near Loch Tay in . Perthshire on March 18 and over two weeks later the snow around their . Volkswagen van has yet to melt. The . teenagers have now become part of the community in the village of . Bridge of Balgie. They are staying at Milton Croft B&B where they . are doing odd jobs for food and shelter. Miss . Kumschier said: 'We thought it was going to be a cool adventure and . even took photographs next to the warning sign, but didn't think it was . going to be a problem.’ ‘We . are in a serious disaster. It is like Siberia and a natural disaster for . upland farmers. It’s been mentally, physically and financially very . draining for every farmer. We have lost 26 sheep.’ Farmers have to pay up to £20 for each dead animal to be collected by knackers' yards, but the Farmers’ Union of Wales has called for emergency aid and a relaxation of the rules for burying. ‘We . have a ridiculous situation whereby it is illegal under EU regulations . to bury animals, and have to pay for them to be removed and disposed,’ said president Emyr Jones, who has a farm near Bala. ‘In many areas every building is . being used to house livestock. Animals which have to be turned out are . going out onto deep snow and Arctic conditions. The ewe and lamb losses . are heart-breaking.’ Defra guidance for farmers states . that the burial or burning of fallen stock in the open is banned 'due to . the risk of spreading disease through residues in the soil, groundwater . or air pollution'. A Defra (Department for Environment, . Food and Rural Affairs) spokesman said: 'British farmers do a fantastic . job but the bad weather has been a severe blow. Hungry: Farmer Dai Brute feeds sheep in one of his fields over the weekend at Gwndwnwal Farm in Brecon . 'We’ve relaxed rules on driver . hours to allow extra time for essential deliveries of animal feed get . through to farms. We’ve also permitted farmers with . red diesel in their tractors to help grit and clear snow from public . roads to help communities during the bad weather. 'We have asked the . National Fallen Stock Collectors to consider reduced costs for multiple . collections of stock from the same farm. If exceptionally bad weather makes . it very difficult for farmers to get carcases to a vehicle, then . disposal on site will be allowed.' 'Under EU legislation we are not allowed to bury them. It’s ridiculous. We are in a serious disaster' Gareth Wyn Jones, farmer in Llanfairfechan, North Wales . Wales Natural Resources and Food . Minister Alun Davies said: ‘I’m very aware of the extreme difficulties . farmers are experiencing as a result of the extreme weather we have . witnessed. 'I have . asked my Chief Veterinary Officer to look urgently at what the Welsh . Government can do to alleviate the burden on farmers.’ Wales’ chief vet Christianne Glossop said the Government was looking at applying for a law change. ‘We have got to focus on what they can . do with their dead stock, whether or not it's possible for us to . introduce a short-term, time-limited derogation (in the law),’ she told . BBC Radio Wales. ‘That is . outside of the current legislation and that's why we're working closely . with lawyers to figure out how we might do that, if we can.’ Chilly: Two women wrapped up against the cold take a dog for a walk today in Hyde Park, central London. Britain had its coldest ever Easter with a record low temperature of -12.5C at Braemar in Scotland . Farmers are suffering severe hardship as the prolonged cold weather, animal disease and soaring feed prices have combined to create a ‘perfect storm’, industry experts warned today. Now the Prince's Countryside Fund has pledged an extra £219,000 in disaster relief aid to ease the burden as forecasters predicted no immediate end to the icy weather. But despite welfare organisations welcoming the extra cash they said the problem was beyond their means and could require an injection of as much as £1million. They added that livestock farmers already devastated by bovine TB and the Schmallenberg virus now faced escalating bills to feed the cattle driven indoors by the icy blasts. Ian Bell, director of the Addington Fund, which provides homes for farming families, said the crisis was bigger than the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak as almost every business was now affected. He said: ‘It is beyond the capabilities of the farming charities, it is too much for us. I am not a doom-monger but having to deal with this on a day-to-day basis, the whole thing is very depressing.’ Season starting: The first of hundreds of spring swan eggs to be laid at the Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset . Beautiful scene: The sunrise over Danbury, Essex, this morning, as the cold weather continued for Britain . As . hill farmers faced one of their biggest crises since the Sixties, . temperatures in Fort William in the Scottish Highlands dropped to -5C . overnight and the cold snap continued for Britain. Tonight is forecast to be dry and cold . with lengthy clear spells, although Scotland will see some patchy low . cloud and mist at times, while there will be a very widespread and . locally-sharp frost. Tomorrow will be a dry day for most areas with sunny periods and patchy cloud, with the South seeing cloud and a few light showers and the chance of a few wintry showers in eastern Scotland. Thursday will be rather cloudy over Scotland with a scattering of showers while elsewhere it will be mainly dry with some sunshine, although the far South will be cloudy with a chance of rain. Friday will be mainly dry with sunny spells and well-broken cloud, but the far north of Scotland will be cloudy with patchy rain or sleet. It will be staying cold throughout with widespread frosts.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A bigamist married by the Archbishop of York was jailed yesterday over a £150,000 welfare scam. Ugandan Rebecca Muwonge married three times under different identities to remain illegally in the UK and claim benefits. In 1996 John Sentamu, who became archbishop nine years later, married Muwonge to Samuel Bisaso at Holy Trinity, in Tulse Hill, south London. Benefits cheat Rebecca Muwonge (pictured centre), at her first marriage to Samuel Bisaso in 1996, which was conducted by John Sentamu (far left), who became Archbishop of York in 2005 . Two years later Muwonge, 47, married Bisaso again – this time in the name of a niece whose identity she had already used to enter the UK without permission. And in 1999, despite never divorcing Bisaso, she married Crispine Atessa, a Swiss national. Bisaso was later ordained by the archbishop, who is Ugandan, in that country’s Anglican church. Muwonge was jailed for two and a half years at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured . Both Muwonge and Bisaso were jailed for 18 months in 2011 for immigration offences involving sham marriages. Muwonge was pregnant and gave birth to the  youngest of her five children behind bars. But she was hauled back before the courts following an inquiry by Newham and Enfield councils into benefit fraud. It also emerged she had pretended to be homeless to secure a London council house which she then bought cut-price under right to buy. Although she had never worked she was given a mortgage by Santander after saying she worked in data input. Three years later she sold the house back to the council for a profit of £70,500. Muwonge, who lives in Grimsby, admitted false accounting, a benefit offence and obtaining property by deception. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the fraud totalled at least £147,000 and she was jailed for two and a half years. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Samuel Bisaso was a chaplain for the Mission to Seafarers church charity in Immingham, near Grimsby.

"By . Joshua Gardner . As Barbara Walters gets ever closer to her retirement next month, the 84-year-old says she might return to the interviewee who won her the highest ratings of her 50 years on TV: Monica Lewinsky. Walters' 1999 interview with the scandalous former White house intern drew a record 74 million viewers, but the TV news queen says it's Lewinsky's personal saga that could win her the spot as Walters' final ever interview. 'I’d like to interview Monica again. I think Monica’s story is very interesting, because everybody else has been able to move on. I’m touched by the fact that she hasn’t been able to,' Walters said. Redo: Retiring TV news queen Barbara Walters says she'd like to make Monica Lewinsky her final interview. Their 1999 sit down was Walters' largest ratings draw ever with an historic 74 million viewers . Years of Barbara: Walters, 84, will retire next month after shattering the gender glass ceiling with her 50 years on television . Walters made the statement in a recent Variety cover story, but it isn't the first time she's both praised Lewinsky and hinted she may be her last interview. Shortly after Walters shocked and saddened the world with the May 2013 announcement of her retirement, she discussed Lewinsky during a sit down with Extra. 'I wouldn't mind if my last one was Monica Lewinsky,' she said. 'I like Monica. She hasn't been seen,' continued Walters. 'I think she's a good person and I wouldn't mind doing an interview with her.' A few days later, Walters brought it up again while chatting with David Letterman. 'I think she has an OK life,' she said. 'I think it’s still difficult for her. Since this is my last year in television, I would love to be able to talk to Monica again.' While all signs suggest Lewinsky will be Walters' last chosen interview--and it's hard to fathom the now 40-year-old would turn it down--the woman who helped Bill Clinton get himself impeached isn't the only person on Walters' bucket list. She's also said she'd love to make history by getting a rare interview with Queen Elizabeth or the pope.","Walters says she's intrigued that Lewinsky has not moved on from the White House scandal while the other players all have .

"By . Juliet Paylor . Actress Katherine Heigl has filed a $6 million civil lawsuit against New . York pharmacy Duane Reade for using her name and an unauthorized . paparazzi photograph of her in its commercial advertising. The actress is said to be livid that photographs of her leaving the New York store last month carrying several shopping bags were used by the company, who tweeted the snap along with the caption: 'Love a quick #DuaneReade run? Even @KatieHeigl can't resist shopping #NYC's favorite drugstore.' The complaint said she was photographed in March near a Duane Reade . store in New York while filming a new television series. Duane Reade . posted the photo on its Twitter and Facebook account with captions . advertising the store without her approval, the complaint said. Scroll down for video . A picture's worth $6 million apparently! Katherine Heigl is suing drug store chain Duane Reade for using this photo of her leaving one of their New York stores last month to promote the company without her consent . Duane Reade did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'We . expect Duane Reade to pay for its willful misuse of Katherine Heigl's . name and likeness,' said her lawyer Peter Haviland, adding that any . money recovered would go to a charity she has supported for many years. The . complaint said Heigl intends to donate all proceeds from the lawsuit to . The Jason Debus Heigl Foundation, which was established in 2008 after . her brother was killed in a car accident. The lawsuit reads like a virtual résumé, though it greatly exaggerates the mom-of-two's career success, having failed to have a hit TV show or film since she left Grey's Anatomy in 2010 due to her conflict with creator Shonda Rhimes. 'Plaintiff is a highly successful television and motion picture actress, producer and celebrity,' the documents read, listing her various credits. 'Plaintiff continues to be in high demand in the entertainment industry.' It continues: 'A recent search for ""Katherine Heigl"" on the Google search engine returned over 3.2 million results.' 'Plaintiff continues to be in high demand in the entertainment industry': The actress - snapped picking up supplies on March 16 with her mother, Nancy - states in her lawsuit that she is a 'highly successful television and motion picture actress, producer and celebrity' It also cites as many as 754,000 Twitter followers - which is in stark contrast to big-name stars such as her Killers co-star Ashton Kutcher, who has 15.9 million. The lawsuit said the tweet featured a paparazzi photograph of Heigl which was also posted on Facebook. It included a logo in the lower right corner that said, 'Just Jared,' referring to a celebrity news website specializing in paparazzi . photographs. It added that the . actress 'is highly selective and well compensated' when she chooses to . endorse a product or service. But she did not authorize the store to use . her name, picture or image. 'Duane Reade is liable for not less than $6 million in compensatory and punitive or treble damages,' according to the lawsuit. On Thursday a source told UsWeekly that the former child star had contacted the company before filing. 'Her attorneys reached out to Duane Reade after [the tweet] was posted,; the insider told the site. 'They called and asked for it to be taken down, and Duane Reade ignored them. She tried repeatedly to have this settled without a lawsuit.' All for a good cause: While the damages she's seeking are undoubtedly inflated, the lawsuit at least specifies that all proceeds will go to animal welfare league The Jason Debus Heigl Foundation - founded by Katherine and Nancy in memory of her late brother .","Emmy-award winning actress Katherine Heigl has announced a $6 million lawsuit against New York pharmacy chain Duane Reade .

"By . Amy Croffey . The Kardashian family should count themselves lucky that Kris Jenner can always be counted on to have their backs especially when it comes to defending her celebrity family. The world's most infamous momager appeared on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday morning to slam a number of rumours about her reality show daughters and her ex-husband. At first, it sounded like the 58-year-old may have been pulling a Khloe à la Sunrise, when presenter Kyle Sandilands asked her about Bruce Jenner's rumoured sex change the line cut out. On-trend: Kris was seen leaving Craig's Restaurant in West Hollywood on Wednesday, carrying a stylish Chanel backpack . Rumour mill! Kris Jenner, pictured arriving at her office on Wednesday, was on hand to defend her celebrity family on KIIS's Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday morning . Sex change rumours: The 58-year-old, pictured accompanying her ex-husband Bruce Jenner for a stroll in Thailand last week, dispelled speculation that he is to have a sex change . However, ever the professional, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians matriarch was back on the phone a short time later ready to defend her ex-husband. 'That's a story they've been writing since the Seventies, and I think they just keep regurgitating stuff... and the more sensational the headline they are going to sell magazines,' Kris said. 'It's just like unbelievable that these blatant lies are printed and people are gullible and they buy the magazines,' she added, clearly irate. She then managed to change the topic saying, 'We just all got back from vacation and had a great time and the family is great and we are looking forward to Kim getting married and the babies are doing well.' Bride-to-be again! Kim Kardashian, seen arriving at Kris's office in Calabasas on Wednesday, has not shown her mother her new wedding dress . Putting to bed those Playboy rumours, Kris laughed off reports that she would ever pose nude for the magazine. 'Oh my God, no!' she said. 'I don't think anyone wants to see me without any clothes on.' 'The older you get, the harder it is. I love to work out and love to feel feel like I'm in shape... Last summer I posted those bikini photos because I thought it was so inspirational for someone in their fifties to have some motivation and say 'wow' anybody can put a bathing-suit on.' Killer figure: Kris posted this stunning bikini shot in January with the caption 'Celebrate Life' Blue beauty: She also showed off her figure in a electric blue bikini in another Instagram post last September . The black-haired beauty also dispelled whispers that daughter Kim's wedding to rapper Kanye West in Paris in the coming months could be cancelled because of a rule that says a couple must live in France for 40 days before they can tie the knot. 'As far as Kim and Kanye go, everything is on track and they actually have a place there, they have a house in Paris.' Kim's wedding number three seems to be all go, however, Kris has yet to see her second eldest daughter's wedding dress and admitted that she doesn't know what the wedding plans are. She said that Kim wants to do things very differently 'from last time round', with something a little more simple and in keeping with Parisian tradition. Speaking about what is set to be one of the biggest Vogue covers ever, Kris said it was so 'top-secret' that not even the rest of the family knew about it. 'It was so exciting' to go through it all with Kim and 'watch one of her dreams unfold', Jenner said. Heart broken: Khloe Kardashian was clearly struggling to walk with her Barney's New York shopping bags at the family office on Wednesday . Going from the pending nuptials of one daughter to the marriage break-up of another, Kris admitted, 'Khloe and Lamar are still apart... there is not really any change there that I know of or that I can report. She is just hanging in there and doing her best.' The news will surely add fire to speculation that the newly single 29-year-old is dating rapper French Montana. The quick-firing radio presenters also asked about Khloe's Sunrise saga and whether she cut the line after they asked her about her 10-month-old neice North West or if it was an accidental dropout. Kris laughed that she didn't even hear about the uproar, saying she was probably asleep back in LA. New show! Kourtney Kardashian, seen shopping in Calabasas on Wednesday, is set to move to the Hamptons with Khloe to film a new spin-off show . Car door trouble: The eldest Kardashian sibling struggled to get into her white Mercedes SLS with gull wing doors . To help get her mind of her crumbled marriage, Khloe plans to move to the Hamptons in Long Island with Kourtney in the next two months to film a new spin-off - Khloe and Kourtney take the Hamptons. It'll give Kourtney's partner Scott Disick a chance to show their children Mason, four, and 20-month-old Penelope the place in which he grew up following the deaths of both his parents in the last six months. New romance: Khloe is rumoured to be dating rapper French Montana pictured together last Friday at P Diddy's son's birthday party .","Momager hasn't seen Kim's bridal gown yet and isn't included in wedding plans .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ramadan is set to add to London's Olympic traffic woes as thousands of Muslims squeeze into non-Games lanes to worship at the many mosques that surround the Olympic Park. Every year during the month of August, vast crowds of worshippers . descend on east London - one of the most concentrated Muslim communities in the country - for nightly prayer. Local councillor Abdal Ullah said the influx of people to the area, between central London and Stratford, will play havoc with Games road links and traffic . hotpsots. The district surrounding the Olympic Park is home to more than 250,000 Muslims and almost 100 mosques. Prayers in Spitalfields: Every year during the month of August, vast crowds of worshippers descend on east London, which has one of the most concentrated Muslim communities in the country . The borough's biggest, The East London Mosque, in Whitechapel, draws over 5,000 congregants during Ramadan. 'The areas all around the mosques get . very busy around prayer time during Ramadan, and there is often traffic . chaos on nearby roads and it will be busier on the Underground,' Councillor Ullah told NBCNews.com. Warning: Local councillor Abdal Ullah said large crowds traveling to the area between central London and Stratford for nightly worship will play havoc with Olympic road links and traffic hotpsots . He added: 'Although the prayers are in the late evening, many people will stay on . at the Olympic Park after events and will be traveling through East . London late in the day and might not be expecting it to be congested, . which is a big concern.' It is the first time Ramadan has fallen on an Olympic Games since Moscow 1980. During the religious festival, which started at . 3.17am today, Muslims are expected to go without food and drink . from dawn until dusk for 30 days. There are some 3,000 Muslim athletes . competing in the Games, although most have been given special . dispensation by religious leaders to waive the obligation while taking . part. Meanwhile, . Londoners were warned today to expect the capital’s roads to 'look and . feel different' from Monday as work on Olympic-only traffic lanes nears . completion. The 30 miles of . Games Lanes, which will accommodate 1,300 vehicles an hour carrying . athletes, officials and VIPs, will be in operation from Wednesday. Road marking for the Lanes - which . run alongside existing lanes - and alterations to 1,300 sets of traffic . lights has already begun. Tonight the final stage of work on the Lanes, involving 2,000 contractors, will start and continue for five nights. Work . includes erection of three temporary pedestrian footbridges at Hyde . Park Corner, and installation of barriers for restricted turns. The . first Games Lane - on the M4 in west London - came into operation on . Monday. Drivers will be able to use the other Games Lanes until they . become active on Wednesday. The Lanes form part of a 109-mile Olympic Route Network (ORN) in London and will generally operate between 6am and midnight. Ready? London motorists are preparing for chaos on the roads of the capital after confusion already struck last week . Confusion: It was unclear when exactly the Olympic lanes came into force . Drivers who illegally use the Lanes or stop along the route face a penalty charge of £130, while illegally parked vehicles will be impounded and could incur a release fee of £200. Earlier this week, American hurdler Kerron Clement tweeted that his bus journey from Heathrow to the Olympic Village in Stratford, east London, had taken four hours and that this had not offered him a good first impression of London. London Mayor Boris Johnson said afterwards that it was thought this particular journey actually took two and a half hours. He added that it was hoped to get transfer times to Stratford down to as little as one hour. Transport for London (TfL) said: 'The works (being carried out) will progressively change London’s road network so that, by Monday morning, London’s road network will look and feel different.' Restrictions: The A4 takes traffic from the M4, where a Games Lane runs for three and a half miles between junctions three and two on the London-bound carriageway . Leon Daniels, TfL’s surface transport managing director, said: 'Our advice to road users is clear - don’t get caught out. Avoid driving in central London, around the ORN and Games venues.' Last week the M4 Olympic lane opened and caused widespread confusion on the road. Motorists were unsure whether they were allowed in the newly opened lane, and many cut in at the last minute before the lane began causing panic amongst the other drivers. Athletes who had recently arrived in the country took to Twitter to vent their fury over the confusing new road markings. US 400m hurdler Kerron Clement expressed his frustration when he tweeted: 'Um, so we’ve been lost on the road for four hours’ ‘Not a good first impression, London.’ Bizarre: Motorists travelling along Southampton Row in central London face just two options  - and both are illegal. They can either travel in the bus lane, the Olympic lane or on the wrong side of the road . Odd: This picture shows another view of the confusing road. Motorists caught travelling in either a bus lane or Olympic lane during operational hours face a £130 fine . The confusion somehow increased further when it emerged that one of the Olympic lanes in central London meets a bus lane - and there is no road between the two for other motorists. Dubbed 'the road to nowhere', Southampton Row seems impossible for motorists to navigate down without incurring a heavy fine. Londoners and visitors can expect more confusion akin to this come Monday as the Games approaches and have been advised to avoid busy areas both on the roads and on public transport links on both the underground and on buses throughout. Yellow route: . Roads on this route will have a dedicated 'Olympic-only' lane for . athletes, officials, VIPs, sponsors and media. The lanes will be in . force from 6am until midnight. Red route: . Roads on this route, the busiest ""core section"" of the VIP network, . will be affected by major restrictions to speed up traffic but will be . fully open to the public. Measures could include bans on parking and . right-turns, suspension of pedestrian crossings, phasing of traffic . lights and no public entry from side roads. Blue route: . Roads on this route will only be affected on competition days. They . will run from the athletes' accommodation to venues such as Wembley . Arena, Earls Court and Wimbledon. ROAD . NUMBER .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Today's Natalie Morales has told how training for a marathon after turning 40 and having two children is no easy feat, despite her apparent athleticism. The New Jersey-based news anchor, 41 - who completed five marathons during her twenties and early thirties - exclaimed: 'Things are definitely more painful. I'm old. It hurts!' She is set to run the 42.195km Boston Marathon on April 21 in a bid to raise money for last year's bombing victims and is hoping to beat her 'personal best' of 3:31:02. Bound for Boston: Today Show host Natalie Morales (pictured at an event in New York last month) has told how training for a marathon after the age of 40 is no easy feat despite her apparent athleticism . To date, Ms Morales has scored $13,593 in donations and is appealing for more people to come forward. As part of her training she has been trying to run 50 miles a week, slotting in sprints around her hectic work and home life schedule. A hamstring injury has slowed progress but she is hoping to make a full recovery in time for race day. Athletic: The news anchor completed five marathons during her twenties and early thirties - here she is pictured at the Nautica South Beach Triathlon in 2012 (left) and after completing another charity race last year . '[It's] literally a pain in my butt!' she said, adding determinedly: 'It's always something. You're always fighting through the pain.'

"By . Meghan Keneally . Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis is going to be a father for the first time after he and his girlfriend has revealed that they are expecting twins. The 40-year-old video producer, who made his fortune by filming topless teenagers and college students partying on Spring Break, said that it should be obvious why he and his girlfriend wanted to select the gender of their children. 'I believe people will finally understand my love, respect and admiration for women. I love girls,' he told Us Weekly. Expecting: Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis and his girlfriend of two years Abbey Wilson used IVF to pick the sex of their twins and they said that they were only interested in having girls . Purposeful search: Francis met Abbey Wilson when she won his magazine's 'Search for the Hottest Girl in America' contest in 2012 . Gender selection is not an open . practice, particularly for couples having their first children, but some . doctors do bend the rules. Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and India all have outright bans on genetic selection for non-medical purposes, but the United States does not. In . the United States, pre-natal genetic diagnosis tests are available . which allows the couple to determine the gender of the embryo before it . is implanted. Fertility clinics make their own rules on where they stand in the issue, so certain clinics allow sex selection on any grounds while others dictate that couples need a medical reason- like certain developmental disorders or genetic diseases- as grounds for dictating the sex. An example of a more loose interpretation of the law used by some couples is when they already have several children of the same sex and opt to use IVF to make sure their next child is the opposite sex. Francis, who has long been a hero to . teenage boys in spite of his multiple lawsuits and arrests, has been . dating his 26-year-old girlfriend for two years. He was introduced to Abbey Wilson when she won Girls Gone Wild's 'Search for the Hottest Girl in America'. 'We both wanted girls and we wanted them to be healthy and free of genetic diseases so we chose to do IVF,' Wilson told Us Weekly. 'I have always heard women say you just know when you are pregnant and I totally understand that now. 'Your body, smell, sensitivity and cravings all change and mine did from day one. I found out shortly after a blood test confirmed the results and called Joe immediately, we were both screaming and so loud with excitement from each end of the phone!' The due date has not been announced. They said that their famous friends have been very supportive and helpful in doling out parenting advice. 'Kourtney . and Scott were the first in the Kardashian family we told and they have . already given us so much amazing advice,' Francis said. Video Source YouTube .

"By . Sam Webb . An iconic quote attributed to Andy Warhol - 'In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes' - may not have actually been said by the influential  pop artist. The painter, sculptor and film maker, who died in 1987, was first credited with the phrase in a brochure at a 1968 exhibition of his work in Sweden. But prominent art critic Blake Glopnik has now cast doubt on its origins, citing the 1997 reminisences of fellow art expert and curator Ole Granath who   was an assistant on the Warhol retrospective, held in Stockholm. Andy Warhol (right) may not have actually said: 'In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes', according to an art critic . The show's curator, Pontus Hulten, had told him to include 'In the future everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes' in the catalogue's compendium of   Warhol quotes. Granath found no record of the quote. even after extensive research. 'If he didn't say it, he very well could have. Let's put it in,' Hulten reportedly   said. Writing in the Warholiana blog, Glopnik said: 'So Andy's phrase was actually Hulten's – not so surprising, given that Hulten later faked some Warhol Brillo   boxes.' Famous for more than 15 minutes: Andy Warhol's 1962 painting 'Orange Marilyn' Other accounts throw add further mystery to the origins of the quote.  Philip Pearlstein, who was at art school with Warhol, revealed to Glopnik that he'd said something similar himself in 1946, when the two artists first   met. Warhol, still a teenager, asked Pearlstein what it was like to be the winner of a national art competition for high school students. Warhol may have first heard a similar version of the phrase when he was just a teenager . Pearlstein said: 'My spontaneous answer was, 'It only lasted five minutes'.' In 2005 photographer Nat Finkelstein claimed he was the source of the line. In 1965, during an outdoor photoshoot with Warhol, some people tried to   push into the shot. 'Andy's looking at them and he says to me, ""Gee whiz, Nat, everybody wants to be famous"",' said Finkelstein. 'I say back, ""Yeah, for about 15 minutes, Andy"". He took that line. My quote became Andy Warhol's famous words.' However, in a book he published in 1989, Finkelstein said the artist had uttered the famous words during the shoot, making no mention of Warhol stealing   his line. Glopnik says the murkiness of the phrase's origins fit in with the way Warhol took influences from a variety of sources. 'By the late 1970s, Warhol himself was mentioning the line (not always clearly as his) at various times and in various places and in various weird   versions, even saying that he's grown bored with it,' he said. 'But that doesn't tell us much about whether he came up with it in the first place: Warhol, the world's greatest sponge, would hardly have proclaimed   that he hadn't coined his trademark aphorism. Warhol's art and persona were all about the rewards of his sponging.' 'Elementary, my dear Watson' – Sherlock Holmes . This line never appeared in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's written works. In 1893's The Crooked Man, the words appear, but are separated by several lines of dialogue and are in the wrong order. 'Nice guys finish last' - US baseball manager Leo Durocher . He actually said the words, but the meaning has been taken out of context. Durocher was asked his opinion of the 1946 New York Giants and replied: 'Take a look at them. All nice guys. They’ll finish last. Nice guys – finish last.' 'Just the facts, ma'am' - Sgt Friday in TV police show Dragnet . Sgt Friday actually said: 'All we want are the facts, ma'am.'

"By . Jason Groves . Proposals: Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, unveiled proposals to introduce higher council tax bands to take in properties worth more than £2 million . Tens of thousands of homes will be hit by a reformed ‘mansion tax’ shortly after the general election under Liberal Democrat plans. Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, unveiled proposals to introduce higher council tax bands to take in properties worth more than £2 million. But nine in ten of those forced to pay the extra levy would live in London and the South East - in houses rather than mansions - thanks to soaring property prices. Mr Alexander however played down the impact on homeowners, saying that those in receipt of council tax benefit or who were on low incomes could be exempt or get discounts. But he admitted the policy would ‘release a wee bit of steam’ from the top end of the housing market. Pensioners who have expensive homes but low incomes would be able to defer the tax until after their death, aides to Mr Alexander later said. The new levy would be paid in addition to ordinary council tax. Although local authorities would collect the levy, the revenue would go straight to the Treasury. However the reform is a partial climb down for the Lib Dems, who planned to introduce a flat one per cent tax on properties worth more than £2 million for every pound over that threshold. Mr Alexander told a business audience that his new proposal had been subjected to Treasury modelling and would be a ‘modest, additional banded levy on top of council tax for high value properties’. ‘The annual charges, in addition to council tax will be set out in good time ahead of the general election next year.’ He added: ‘By building on the council tax system, there will be no need for a detailed valuation of the small proportion of properties affected. Crucially, this means that this policy could be implemented quickly after the election.’ Mr Alexander added that ‘with the level of the bands up rated annually, people living in typical family homes need have no fear of being sucked into this levy.’ A revaluation has been put off by successive governments, as it would be hugely expensive, politically unpopular and force thousands of home owners into higher bands. Under the new plans, anyone in a house under £2 million would continue to pay council tax as usual and face no extra levy. Concentrated: According to figures from property website Zoopla, more than a third of the 82,269 houses that are worth more than £2 million are in a single London borough - Kensington and Chelsea . Mr Alexander - who is tipped as a potential successor to Nick Clegg as leader of the Lib Dems - will not set out the bands until closer to the general election. But he did cite an example of an £8 million home which might fall into a band of £5 million to £10 million. The Cabinet minister said the broader bands would ensure there were fewer challenges about the valuations of homes. He had feared that the previous Lib Dem policy of would lead to a wave of appeals against property valuations. But according to figures from property website Zoopla, more than a third of the 82,269 houses that are worth more than £2 million are in a single London borough - Kensington and Chelsea. A further 31 per cent are in the boroughs of Westminster and Camden. Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: ‘Homeowners in London and the South East already pay the lion’s share of UK property taxes with the stamp duty thresholds placing a heavy burden already on higher priced properties.’ Promises: Ed Miliband has pledged to introduce mansion tax if he becomes Prime Minister . Nearly 11,000 homes worth more than £2 million are outside the capital but in the South East, according to the research drawn from Land Registry figures. Mr Alexander’s new mansion tax would raise an estimated £1.2 billion a year. This is less than the £1.7 billion to £2 billion previously cited by both the Lib Dems and Labour. Ed Miliband has also pledged to introduce a mansion tax if he becomes prime minister. The British Property Federation had previously warned that a flat one per cent mansion tax on properties over £2 million could be turned into a political football and deter investment and development. But it welcomed the new proposals. Liz Peace, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: ‘We are delighted that the Lib Dems are taking this much more sensible approach to the Mansion Tax. The council tax system remains in principle a better way of taxing property, if the valuations on which it is based are up-to-date. ‘At present we have a property tax that is based on 1991 values, when the average house in the UK was worth, £62,000, the Soviet Union was still in existence and Bryan Adams topped the charts. Adding some additional bands of council tax makes sense as a sticking-plaster measure, but ultimately if fairness is politicians’ goal then only a full revaluation in conjunction with more bands will do this. ‘ .","Nine in ten of those affected by levy would live in London and South East .

"By . Bianca London . Just two days ago Kate Moss was unveiling her hotly anticipated collection for Topshop but there's no rest for the world's most famous supermodel. Aside from her fashion designing duties, 40-year-old Kate has been quietly creating a new beauty range for Rimmel London. The colourful collection of mascaras, lipsticks, eyeliners and nail varnish is bound to brighten up the nation's make-up bags this season and Kate shows us how to work the season's best beauty trends in the new campaign imagery. Does she ever stop? Kate Moss has unveiled a new beauty range for Rimmel London and models the colour-popping shades in the new imagery . Kate, who has been working with the beauty giant for several years, has created her first-ever eye collection called Idol Eyes - a fitting name for the world-famous supermodel.

She's also a fan of . scouring the rails of second hand stores. A weave waistcoat, suede . shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in keeping with the . Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a jacket the . 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which she refers . to as her 'gig . jacket'. As well as . channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback . style.

"By . Christian Gysin . Shot dead: Edgar Dart was gunned down in front of his family when he tried to remonstrate with three masked and gun-toting intruder . A boy of 13 watched his British father bleed to death in an armed raid on their luxury family home in the Bahamas. Edgar Dart, 56, was gunned down in front of his family when he tried to remonstrate with three masked and gun-toting intruders. The gang were threatening his teenage son George and five relatives after bursting into the sprawling property at 7am on Tuesday. As Mr Dart lay dying on the floor, the killers tied the rest of the family up and ransacked the house before fleeing with cash and jewellery. Mr Dart’s brother-in-law Philip Poole said his own son, Pip, 29, was also attacked and suffered machete wounds. He added: ‘Edgar was a tough guy and as soon as the men burst into the house he remonstrated with them. One of the raiders then shot him in the chest. ‘The gang then tied everyone up, including his mother Joy and George. I have been told they were forced to look on helplessly as Edgar lay on the floor bleeding to death in front of them. ‘It took him around an hour to die and there was just nothing they could do for him. ‘The gang simply ransacked the house taking money and jewellery and then left. We just cannot believe what has happened. 'It is so difficult being so many miles away when family members have been involved in something as horrific as this. ‘The police report on the killing is very scant. Crime is on the increase on the island and they do not want such matters reported because they fear it will damage the tourist industry.’ The house near the city of Freeport belongs to Joy, who is a 79-year-old widow. Murder scene: The Dart family home on the island of Grand Bahama where Edgar Dart was shot . Her other son Colin, 55, his wife Alison and their 15-year-old son Luke also witnessed the murder. Mr Poole, from Canterbury, added: ‘I do know that Alison managed to finally free herself and raise the alarm but by then it was too late for Edgar who had bled to death. ‘The worst image we have from this tragedy is George bound and gagged watching his father die – and there was nothing he could do to help him.’ Joy moved to Grand Bahama in 1996 and built a house on the island with her husband Colin, who died of cancer in December. George Dart photographed in 2006 was tied up as his father Edgar was shot dead . Mr Dart’s 57-year-old sister, Virginia Redfern, who owns a hotel in Exminster, Devon, plans to fly out to help comfort family members. Born in Devon, Mr Dart had a farm in Topsham near Exeter before emigrating to Canada 16 years ago. The divorcee took up agriculture again in Winnipeg and often flew to visit his mother. Crime has become a problem for the authorities on Grand Bahama, and eight murders have been recorded this year. Two months ago the US embassy warned that ‘a number of US citizens had fallen victim to armed robbery and two had been murdered in the last eight months’. The most recent victims were two American tourists visiting Jaws Beach in the western New Providence area. They were mugged by robbers armed with assault rifles. In one particularly embarrassing incident that emerged last December, acting prime minister Philip Davis was robbed at gunpoint. Last night the police issued a statement saying: ‘Police received information that a male was fatally shot at a residence in the Emerald Bay area. ‘Officers responded and it was reported that sometime around 7am on Tuesday a male reported that while at home with his family, three masked men armed with a handgun and a machete entered their home and they were robbed. An altercation occurred between the assailant and one of the male residents, who was fatally shot. ‘Medical personnel responded and the body was pronounced dead at the scene by doctors from the Rand Memorial Hospital.’ Officers appealed for information to track down the gang. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in the Bahamas and we are providing consular assistance.’","Edgar Dart, 56, was gunned down in front of his family in Grand Bahama .

"By . Jason Groves . Maverick Tory MP Michael Fabricant was sacked as the party’s vice-chairman last night over his ‘uncontrollable’ behaviour on Twitter – including jokes about having an affair with a llama and criticism of senior ministers. Mr Fabricant, one of Parliament’s most colourful MPs, has built up a cult following on the social media site with his edgy comments and lewd jokes. But his outpourings have caused alarm at Tory high command in recent months. Sacked: Michael Fabricant (left) was ousted from his post as Tory party vice-chairman after Tweeting his relief following Maria Miller's resignation . Message: The former Whip informed his Twitter followers after he was removed from his position . 'I'd prefer to date Farage than Clegg' The final straw appears to have been a . series of hostile messages about beleaguered Culture Secretary Maria . Miller, culminating in one saying ‘about time’ when she finally resigned . yesterday morning. He . later added: ‘Note to self: If ever a minister again, be like Mark . Harper. If in trouble, resign quickly and in a dignified manner.’ Last . night he was summoned for talks with Conservative Party chairman Grant . Shapps and asked to resign. When he refused, he was sacked. A . source close to Mr Shapps last night insisted that his departure was . mainly down to his opposition to the Government’s plans for a new . high-speed rail line between London, Birmingham and the North of . England. The £50billion HS2 line would carve a swathe through Mr Fabricant’s Lichfield constituency. He . has tabled an amendment to the legislation which would kill the plans . if it is backed by MPs later this month. He has also vowed to defy a . three-line whip to vote against the main legislation. He . is one of around 30 MPs along the line of the route who are expected to . rebel against the plans when they come to the Commons at the end of . this month. ‘This has been . coming for a while,’ the source said. ‘You can’t have a vice-chairman of . the party publicly defying the Government and trying to kill off a key . piece of legislation.’ The . source acknowledged that Mr Fabricant’s public criticism of Mrs Miller . and the former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell had also played a . part in his departure, but insisted it was ‘amicable’. Another . senior Tory source said Mr Fabricant’s Twitter outpourings were the . main reason for his sacking. ‘David Cameron once said too many tweets . make a t***, and this is a case in point,’ the source said. Mr . Fabricant, 63, announced his sacking to his 14,900 followers on Twitter . last night, saying: ‘Been asked to resign as Vice Chairman, refused, so . sacked over HS2 and my views on a recent Cabinet Minister. Still . available for speeches etc.’ He . added: ‘Now free to speak openly about llamas (in-joke) and other . matters.’ The message was a reference to a Twitter exchange earlier this . year, after Mr Fabricant had tweeted his condemnation of Vladimir . Putin’s gay rights record. When . a reader asked about his own sexuality, Mr Fabricant replied he was . having an affair with a llama but would not reveal its gender. A . source at the time said the party’s high command was unamused, adding: . ‘No 10 says it has had enough problems with the party in getting equal . marriage through without you advocating bestiality.’ Another Tory last . night described Mr Fabricant as ‘uncontrollable’. For . years the MP was best known at Westminster for his extraordinary blond . hair, which he has always denied is a wig. But his Twitter fame has . enabled him to build up a wider profile, including an appearance on Have . I Got News For You. Opinion: Earlier in the day, he made his views on Miller's expenses scandal known. Hours later the Culture Secretary resigned from her position . Bizarre: Following his sacking, the MP said: 'Now free to speak openly about llamas' Criticism: The colourful MP also had outspoken views of the £50billion HS2 rail link .

"By . Tara Brady . Chef Henry Stangroom, 21, who was stabbed to death in his flat in south London last year . A jilted lover was found with a harpoon stuck in his own head after stabbing his ex-girlfriend's brother to death in revenge for her leaving him, it has been claimed. Andrew Morris, 30, knifed Henry Stangroom, 21, in the heart at their flat in Battersea, south London, a court heard. Police found Morris with slit wrists and the harpoon sticking out from underneath his chin in the bedroom of the flat. The chef, who worked at the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus, had suffered stab wounds to the heart, lungs and head. Opening the case, prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC said: ‘On the October 17 of last year, police officers found Henry’s lifeless body laying on his bed at Lavender Sweep, Battersea. ‘He had sustained a fatal stab wound to his heart and lungs and had a second wound to his head. ‘The defendant was discovered in the bathroom with wounds to both wrists and a harpoon spear stuck out from underneath his chin. ‘The defendant was taken to hospital where his wounds were treated. ‘There were only two people in the flat, the front door was locked and the keys were on the inside of the door,’ she said. When Morris was arrested he claimed the last thing he could remember was seeing his ex-girlfriend Michelle three days previously. ‘There is going to be no dispute in this case that the defendant inflicted the fatal wound, nor is it going to be in dispute that the defendant cut his own wrists and was responsible for the spear underneath his neck,’ said Ms Plaschkes. ‘It is the Crown’s case that this defendant killed Henry in revenge for Michelle leaving him - rejecting him,’ said Ms Plaschkes. Police found Morris with slit wrists and the harpoon sticking out from underneath his chin in the bedroom of the flat in south London . Michelle had ended the relationship around six weeks before Morris attacked her brother, the court heard. Morris had a history of violent and aggressive behaviour towards his ex girlfriends and had punched partner Ruth Owens in the stomach and spat in her face, it was said. Michelle Stangroom, the sister of Henry Stangroom, who was found dead with stab wounds . ‘He destroyed a canvas painting and a ring, which had been given by her grandmother, he threw into the river. 'He took revenge on her by destroying things that were precious to her,’ said Ms Plaschkes. Morris began his relationship with Ms Stangroom just a few weeks before his girlfriend at the time gave birth to their son. ‘At the end of August, about the 28, the defendant and Michelle had an argument during the course of which the defendant smashed a plate against the wall and was violent towards Michelle, grabbing her shoulders, throwing her onto the sofa and forcibly holding both her hands over he mouth,’ Ms Plaschkes said. When she decided to end the relationship he killed her brother in revenge, it is claimed. Morris, of Lavendar Sweep, Battersea, southwest London, denies murder. The trial continues.

A Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court jury cleared him of causing grievous bodily harm after he told how it was a ‘freak accident’ when she lost her finger. The court heard how Mr Davies had been ‘in a mood’ as he mowed the lawn on a day off. Mrs Davies, a self-employed optician, stood on the mower’s power cable to try to make him stop. But he allegedly tried to free it from underneath her foot, when it caused his wife to fall to the grass under the Flymo’s spinning blades. Mr Davies said: ‘I told her she was standing on the wire and to get off, I got frustrated. I gave the mower an extra shove outwards. The wire was taut and the mower flicked up off the ground. She fell forward.’ Mr Davies turned around to see what had happened - with the motor still running - and his wife’s hand went under the blade. Mrs Davies lost the index finger of . her left hand which was found on the grass. She was treated by doctors . but they were unable to reattach her finger and she now needs to wear a . prosthesis. 'Freak accident': Mr Davies claimed his wife had fallen in the path of the Flymo (file picture) after 'deliberately standing on the lead' in the garden, the court was told . Mr Davies, head of the mathematics department at Blaengwawr Comprehensive School in Aberdare, denied grievous bodily harm. The jury of three men and nine women took . 15 minutes to clear him after hearing references from colleagues who . commended his ‘professionalism’. Lucy Crowther, defending, said: ‘It is quite a tragedy this court has been used to sort out their matrimonial situation.’ Following the incident the couple started divorce proceedings and have attended mediation sessions to attempt to resolve financial and child contact issues.","Stephen Davies, 40, ran over his wife's hand with the Flymo mower .

"By . Wills Robinson . Victim: Shammi Atwal, 45, died after being shoved into the road by a group of armed robbers and was hit by an HGV (right) after they raided his cash and carry, the Old Bailey has heard . A wealthy businessman was crushed to death when a gang of armed robbers pushed him under a lorry as they fled his cash-and-carry, the Old Bailey has heard. Shammi Atwal, 45, confronted the six men after they assaulted his wife, Damanjeet Kaur, in Barking, east London, a jury was told. The father-of-two from Chigwell, Essex, was shoved into the road after he struggled with the group and died from catastrophic injuries when the HGV hit him just yards away from the sucessful business he owned. The raiders got away with just £1,000 after allegedly stormed the warehouse, ran by Mr Atwal's company Glenn & Co, with sledgehammers and metal bars on October 14 last year. They attacked the premises and those who worked there 'intent on taking whatever cash was to hand', David Howker QC told the court. Devidas Sumskas, 25, Farhan Ahmed Sheikh, 39,  Edgaras Balezantis, 25, Vidmantas Gorskoves, 26, Aurimas Diliunas, 27, and Reiniks Kivers, 30, deny manslaughter and conspiracy to rob. Mr Howker, for the prosecution, told the jury: 'Armed robbery is a serious and violent crime and those who take part in such an enterprise, as you appreciate, are obviously prepared to threaten and use violence to achieve their aim, which is to steal cash and get away without being caught. 'In this case that readiness to use whatever force was necessary resulted in a high price being paid because, as they made their escape, some of the workers in the cash-and-carry gave chase. Investigation: Forensic officers examine the scene following the horrific incident in October last year. The court heard the six men got away with just £1,000 . Weapon: An officer from the Met Police holds what appears to be a bat sealed in a plastic container . 'In particular, Damanjeet Kaur’s . husband - one of the owners of the business, Mr Shammi Atwal - gave . chase and confronted one of the robbers on the street outside the . premises. 'Mr Atwal paid . with his life because that robber, in order to escape and get away, . pushed Mr Atwal away and into the path of a lorry. He went under the . wheels of that lorry and was crushed to death. 'Each of these men, we say, was party to the plot to rob Mr Atwal’s business and each of them, we say, bears criminal responsibility for this death.' The court heard that the gang travelled to the Glenn and Co cash-and-carry in a black BMW 5-series car, with some dressed in dark clothing and wearing gloves. They attacked the premises and those who worked there 'intent on taking whatever cash was to hand', Mr Howker said. Search: Officers look for evidence left by the alleged gang members who fled the scene after the suspected robbery . Wealthy: Mr Atwal's business, Glenn & Co was successful, bringing in between £5,000 and £10,000 a day. Police officers searched the premises in the aftermath of the alleged robbery . Mr Atwal and his friend Avtar Mann run the business, which sells beer, wines and spirits to pubs and wine bars. The two men knew each other from India and operated the cash-and-carry on River Road from about 2005. Ms Kaur worked there part-time, spending a few hours there each day while her children were at school, the court heard. The business was taking around £5,000 to £10,000 a day and more at weekends, mainly in cash. On the day of the robbery, the takings for the weekend were due to be banked, the court heard. 'It may not be a coincidence that the robbers chose a Monday to hit the business,' Mr Howker said. All the defendants are Lithuanian except Sheikh, who is alleged to be a close associate of Sumskas, the court heard. The trial continues.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Reading FC player Matthew Partridge, 20, walked free from court despite admitting road rage attack that left motorcyclist's vision damaged . A young professional footballer who left a motorcyclist covered in blood and with damaged vision in one eye after a road rage incident has walked free from court. Reading FC player Matthew Partridge, 20, beat James Mannion, 40, up so badly that he was left with sheets of skin hanging from his neck, lifelong scars and severe vision damage. Partridge let rip when Mr Mannion asked for his insurance details after their vehicles collided at Woolhampton, near Newbury, last August. Yesterday he wept in court as a judge told him she was giving him a suspended jail sentence for his 'disgusting, thuggish' behaviour as she wanted to give him a chance to pay back those who believed in him.' Reading Crown Court heard how the assault happened early on 29 August last year when Partridge and Mr Mannion stopped in a lay-by after a crash. When Partridge, from Thatcham, Berkshire, refused to give his insurance details to Mr Mannion, the victim began taking photographs of the footballer's Vauxhall Astra numberplate. Prosecutor Lisa Goddard said: 'This defendant reacts badly to that and he assaults the victim.' She said Partridge pushed Mr Mannion into a hedge before assaulting him again, holding him by the throat and punching him in the face three times. The prosecutor continued: 'All he was doing was trying to get insurance details. He was doing it in as calm a manner as he could.' Partridge claimed Mr Mannion had provoked him and that he was acting in self-defence, although he admitted a single count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Eamonn Dolan, Reading Football Club’s academy manager, said Partridge, who earns £350 a week and lives with his parents, had been fined one month’s wages following the attack. He told the court that Partridge had made a 'catastrophic' mistake, but said he had a good character. And the academy’s safeguarding manager, David Downs, said he had he potential to make a career as a professional footballer. He said: 'May I please ask that the sentence that is imposed does not destroy his potential career and does not destroy Matthew himself.' The £350 a week footballer wept in the dock as Judge Angela Morris said she would suspend his jail term . Mitigating, Steve Molloy said Partridge was not a thug who went looking for trouble but had lost his temper with 'catastrophic consequences.' Judge Angela Morris said: 'The thug who was behaving in that disgusting fashion on August 29 is a rather different person than is normally present with his employers at Reading Football Club. 'If you think that you have got away with it, you think again, young man' Judge Angela Morris, Reading Crown Court . 'Thuggish behaviour of this nature will not be tolerated and it will be marked by sentences of imprisonment by the court.' Sentencing a crying Partridge to 12 months' imprisonment, the judge agreed to suspend the jail term for two years, prompting sighs of relief from his family. But she warned: 'If for one minute, Mr Partridge, you think that because I’m going to give you a chance today that you have got away with it, you think again right now young man. 'There are a lot of people who are prepared to invest time in you. 'I think it’s time for you to show them that you can respect the investment and the time that they have show in you by demonstrating that you can be the disciplined individual that they have spoken of.' The court heard that Partridge, who was also ordered to do 240 hours of unpaid work and pay £2,000 compensation, had previously been cautioned for punching someone in a nightclub.","Matthew Partridge attacked motorcyclist James Mannion, 40, in lay-by .

"By . Julian Robinson . Andrew Salmon, who has avoided a jail term after locking his wife in a shed . A postman who locked his wife in the shed after she insulted his late mother by singing “ding dong, the witch is dead” has been spared jail. Grieving Andrew Salmon, 42, packed up his wife Beverley’s belongings and refused to let her into their home for allegedly mocking his mother’s passing. When she tried to come in through the back door he bundled her into the garden shed and bolted it shut - just to “p*** her off”, a court heard. The mother of-two, 42, managed to escape through a window and let herself into their home in Truro, Cornwall. Magistrates in Truro heard how she raced upstairs and began throwing her husband’s clothes out of the window. Salmon later told police he was depressed and unhappy his wife of 19 years had not been supportive enough after his mum’s passing last December. The court heard he also suspected she was having an affair, calling her 'nothing but a common prostitute' during the explosive spat on February 6. Salmon told magistrates he merely locked . his wife in the shed to 'p*** her off' after she kept saying: 'Ding . dong, the witch is dead.' Salmon, 42, from Truro in Cornwall said he had put his wife in the shed to 'P*** her off' (file image) After she left the shed he responded . by holding her down by her throat on their bed, punching her, ripping . open her top and violently twisting her breasts. Magistrates handed him a community order for 24 months and ordered him to take part in a building better relationships programme. Salmon, who had no previous convictions, was also fined £100 and told to pay £145 in costs. Salmon said he had suffered depression since the row on February 6 and has been told to attend a relationship course . Mrs Salmon, a receptionist, refused to comment on his conviction. But Salmon continued to blame his wife for not showing enough respect over his mother’s death. The couple, who have two children aged nine and 11, have since split and Salmon has moved out of their marital home. He said: 'She never really got on with my mum or any of my relatives and when my mum died she was horrible and offered me no support - she was extremely unsympathetic. 'She would sing ‘ding dong the witch is dead’ from time to time and didn’t even come to her funeral. It was a really difficult time for me and my family. 'I decided to lock her in the shed as I knew it would really annoy her and that she would be able to get out. 'I shouldn’t have done it and I am sorry but I was provoked into doing it and she gave as good as she got. The things she was saying about my mum were horrible.' He added after the hearing in Truro: 'She was kicking, biting and screaming. I’m sorry the argument ever happened but I never punched her.'

"By . Amanda Williams . A property developer who shot a solicitor in the face with a sawn-off shotgun has been found dead in his prison cell. Bankrupt Michael Chudley, 63, blamed lawyer James Ward for the loss of his house, wife and livelihood in a long-running legal dispute. In July last year, a court heard that paranoid Chudley calmly walked into Mr Ward’s office with a sawn-off shotgun and shot him in the face with a single cartridge as the solicitor chatted on the phone to another client. Michael Chudley-  a property developer who shot a solicitor in the face with a sawn-off shotgun -  has been found dead in his prison cell . In July last year, a court heard that paranoid Chudley calmly walked into Mr Ward's office with a sawn-off shotgun and shot him in the face with a single cartridge . Chudley was just 10 months into his 28 year prison sentence when guards discovered him. He was found 'unresponsive' in his cell on Tuesday morning. His death comes just a week after his appeal against his conviction was thrown out in just ten minutes by top judges. Solicitor James Ward died three weeks later after suffering horrific injuries . A prison spokesman for HMP Winchester, Hants., said: 'MP Winchester prisoner Michael Chudley was found unresponsive in his cell shortly before 5.50am on Tuesday. 'Paramedics attended and attempted CPR but he was pronounced dead at 6.36am.' The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman plan to conduct a full investigation. Chudley was jailed in June for shooting Mr Ward at close range in his office at Morris, Goddard and Ward Law in Devizes, Wiltshire . Mr Ward, 58, a partner with the firm, suffered horrific head injuries and died three weeks later. Remorseless Chudley, of Rowde, Wilts., denied murder but was convicted by a jury who spent just two hours’ deliberating at Salisbury Crown Court. He was sentenced to a minimum of 28 years in prison after Mr Justice Bean said the killing of the father-of-three was 'a chilling, calculated execution'. Chudley had denied murder but was convicted following a nine-day trial at Salisbury Crown Court. The jury of seven men and five women took just two hours to reject Chudley’s defence of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and find him unanimously guilty of murder. Earlier, he had pleaded guilty to carrying an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, possessing the gun with intent to cause unlawful violence towards receptionist Daphne Courtney and threatening to kill Mrs Courtney with it. During the trial, the court heard that when the armed Chudley marched into the solicitors’ office on the afternoon of July 2 and threatened to shoot the receptionist, Mr Ward’s wife, Nicola Morris, a partner in the firm, ran to a neighbouring shop to get help. A prison spokesman for HMP Winchester, Hampshire, said: 'MP Winchester prisoner Michael Chudley was found unresponsive in his cell shortly before 5.50am on Tuesday' Ms Morris heard the gunshot and a shattering of glass and watched as Chudley fled the office in drove off in his Ford Fiesta. The property developer was arrested 30 minutes later by armed police at his former home in the nearby village of Rowde and confessed: 'I shot him because he made our lives a misery.'","Michael Chudley, 63, blamed lawyer James Ward for life falling apart .

"By . Julian Robinson . A coroner has blasted medics for ""serious, repeated and systemic failures"" which led to the death of a pensioner from kidney failure. Stewart Maltby, 64, was not given any fluids for 14 hours after a string of delays in his treatment - including a four hour wait for an ambulance to take him to hospital. An inquest at Nottingham Council House on Tuesday heard how a catalogue of errors by 36 medical staff contributed to Mr Maltby's death on November 7, 2012. Stewart Maltby, 64, died from kidney failure after he was not given any fluids for 14 hours after a string of delays in his treatment . Two days before he died, his GP Dr John Porter visited him at his home in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, after he complained of being dehydrated and suffering from diarrhoea. Dr Porter called East Midlands Ambulance Service at 1.53pm on November 5 and told the operator Mr Maltby, who had previously suffered a stroke, required IV fluids when he arrived at hospital. But the ambulance failed to arrive so the GP dialled 999 saying it was an emergency but the ailing pensioner was not picked up until 6.19pm because of a mistake by the dispatcher logging the call properly. When he finally arrived at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham, he was taken to a ward but further delays meant he did not have fluids until 3.50am the next day. Kidney failure happens when the kidneys encounter difficulty removing salt, water and waste products from the bloodstream. When this occurs, waste products will accumulate and can reach dangerous levels and cause an imbalance in the blood's chemical makeup. Acute renal failure can come on within days or even a matter of hours. Symptoms include tiredness, passing only a small amount of urine or urine being discoloured. Acute failure can be fatal and requires treatment. One course of treatment is to ensure that the correct fluids are introduced to the body and ensuring the amount of salts and minerals remain at the correct levels while the kidneys recover. Even when he was given IV fluids he . was not given the correct dose which meant he received just two litres . within 24 hours instead of the recommended five litres. Mr Maltby died the next day on November 7 after suffering kidney failure. Both the QMC and East Midlands Ambulance Service have apologised to the family. Recording . a narrative verdict, Assistant Coroner Jane Gillespie condemned medical . staff who treated Mr Maltby - branding them ""oblivious"" to his care . needs. She said: ""These . failures were far-reaching and impacted on all aspects of his care, from . basic observations and recordings, to a delay in the escalation of his . care and a failure to review his condition by an appropriately senior . doctor when necessary. ""All the while, Mr Maltby's condition continued to deteriorate and those caring for him were oblivious to the same. ""During . the period of his admission, there were several missed opportunities . when the correct treatment plan could and should have been pursued. ""I find that had this been so, the outcome may have been different."" Speaking after the inquest, Mr Maltby's family blasted the medics who failed to care for their father. A . statement read: ""It is clear that the initial reply from the ambulance . service to our complaint about the delayed response to the call for an . ambulance that they were 'very busy' was simply paying lip service to . their initial failings in this unfortunate and distressing series of . events. ""In his short and tragic time at the QMC, Stewart was dealt with by around 36 people. Queen's Medical Centre where Stewart Maltby was being treated before his death due to kidney failure . ""Some . were clearly shown by the inquest to be hard-working, dedicated . individuals struggling in a highly-pressured environment with little . support from management despite direct and repeated requests for . additional assistance. ""Stewart was a character who made us laugh with his mischievous sense of humour. ""He . spent a lot of time caring for others, often to his own detriment. Eighteen months on he is still very much missed by us all."" Peter . Homa, chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, . said: ""We extend our condolences and reiterate our unreserved apologies . to Mr Maltby's family for the failings in our care and for letting them . and their father down so badly. ""The absence of regular clinical . observations, handovers between staff and failure to administer fluids . appropriately meant Mr Maltby's rapidly deteriorating condition was not . acted upon as it should have been. ""We have learnt from this sad and tragic case and made changes to improve safety and outcomes for our future patients."" A . spokesman from the ambulance service added: ""The service we provided to . Mr Maltby fell short of the high standard our patients should expect, . and we are very sorry about that. ""We have since initiated a number of . changes and issued guidance to all control staff to ensure that the same . error can't be made when entering bookings in future.""","Stewart Maltby waited four hours for ambulance to take him to hospital .

"By . Katy Winter . A husband celebrating his 72nd wedding anniversary has revealed the secret to his long marriage - saying 'yes, dear'. Inseparable Aquilla and Catherine Brant - aged 99 and 95 - met in 1939 on the day World War Two broke out. Aquilla, whose name is Latin for eagle, was in the St John Ambulance and was called to train others in lifesaving skills. Aquilla and Catherine Brant, aged 99 and 95, have been married for 72 years, and now live together in a double room at Pilling House residential home in Skelmanthorpe . Aquilla and Catherine on their wedding day April 8, 1942 at Almondbury Church . The retired electrician was training a group of 12 men at a fever hospital in Dalton, West Yorks., where the future love of his life was working as a nurse. When Aquilla needed some tea and sugar and was told to find Catherine to help him out they fell for each other. He said: 'Yes, it was love at first sight. She was beautiful and still is. 'We just love each other. Of course we’ve had our ups and downs like everybody else and someone once asked me how we’d stayed together so long. 'I told them it was two little words: ""Yes, dear"".' The pair went on to have three children, (L-R) Susan, Carl and Hazel, followed by two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren . The pair met at the very start of World War II when Aquilla came to the hospital where Catherine was working as a nurse (pictured) Aquilla, pictured in his army uniform in Germany, 1946, says meeting Catherine was love at first sight: 'She was beautiful and still is' He added that they rarely had a cross word and if they did they always sorted it out. The aged lovebirds, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, now share an double room at Pilling House residential home in Skelmanthorpe. Aquilla, who will turn 100 in December, said: 'We try to argue things out and agree about it at the end. We’ve never come to any blows. 'We have always lived harmoniously and Catherine is very understanding and loves everybody, even her enemies.' Former nurse Catherine, who will be 96 next month, said: 'You shouldn’t hate anybody. You should pray for your enemies, and it’s surprising how they will react when you do that. 'I love people and Aquilla doesn’t love people as much. He’ll say: ""Oh, is she coming again?""' The romantics married on April 8, 1942 at Almondbury Church before spending a few days on honeymoon in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. Catherine and Aquila, pictured on holiday in France in 2000, say they rarely have cross words, even after decades of marriage . Aquilla, here with Catherine in France, says he tells those who ask the secret to their marital bliss that it is 'saying ""yes dear"" They have been back to spa town since, trying to re-trace their steps, but were disappointed not to find where they stayed. 'We saw lambs being born and Aquilla leaned back and broke a chair but we never told anybody,' smiled Catherine. By the time of his wedding Aquilla had been called up into the Army while his wife continued working as a nurse. When he was demobbed in 1946 he started work at a chemicals plant, he later moved to work for many years at a power station, where he was a maintenance electrician. The pair are still obviously in love, with Aquilla saying that Catherine 'loves everybody', while Catherine gushes that Aquilla can 'fix anything' Catherine worked as a nurse until she left to bring up her family. The couple went on to have three children Carl, Susan and Hazel, two grandchildren John and Amanda and four great-grandchildren Tom, Sam, Alexandra and William. Surrounded by his wooden carvings in their room Catherine said Aquilla could mend anything. 'There was nothing he couldn’t do. He must have saved us so much money over the years. 'If a pan handle broke I would look forward to getting something new but he would get his soldering iron out and he would repair it. 'He has even made his own false teeth but that’s another story. I’ll tell you  that when he’s 100,' said Catherine.","Met in hospital where Catherine worked as a nurse in 1939 at start of WWII .

Actress Julie Gayet won £12,400 in damages from the French magazine Closer last month after it published photos which it said were of President Hollande leaving her Paris flat. No right to privacy: Former First Lady Carla Bruni (left) has waded into the row over current President Francois Hollande's affair with Julie Gayet (right), saying he had no right to privacy because public funds were involved . Scandal: The revelations prompted Hollande (left) to split from long-term partner Valerie Trierweiler (right) The story caused a national scandal in France and saw Hollande's long-term partner Valerie Trierweiler move out of the Elysee Palace. She publicly blamed 'low blows' and 'betrayals' for the break-up in January, adding it had been ‘like being hit by a high speed train', and checked herself into a public hospital for eight days suffering from stress. The incident sparked outcry in some quarters of France, which has some of the strictest privacy laws in the world. But in an interview with the New York Post this week, Italian-born former model Ms Bruni, 46, said: 'You must understand that France has a law that is supposed to protect privacy. But nowhere else in the world does such a law exist. 'This is public money, right? So . it can’t be private. If the French magazine won’t publish this kind of . story, the Belgian one will, and it comes out everywhere.' Outspoken: Italian-born Ms Bruni (left with her husband Nicolas Sarkozy) told the New York Post: 'This is public money, right? So it can’t be private. If the French magazine won’t publish this kind of story, the Belgian one will' Ms Bruni said: 'France has a law...to protect privacy. Nowhere else in the world does such a law exist' Earlier this year 41-year-old Ms Gayet . launched a criminal claim for breach of privacy against the magazine for . using the photos, which showed the man it claimed was the President . with his face concealed inside a motorcycle helmet.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A cyclist outraged by the bad behaviour of his fellow bikers has captured their dangerous moves on camera and created a montage of the incidents which include jumping red lights, cutting up motorists and using mobile phones while pedalling. The man, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from other cyclists, has spent the last three weeks filming the footage in York city centre and has posted it on the internet to highlight the misdemeanors. The most startling incident shows a cyclist going head-over-heels on a main road when he attempts to take off his jacket while on the move. Scroll down for video . The cyclist said he was fed up of other bikers ignoring the Highway Code and filmed their moves to highlight the dangers. One man was spotted attempting to take his coat off while riding along a busy road, pictured . The footage, filmed by a disgruntled cyclist in York, caught on camera the moment a man attempted to take his jacket off while cycling on the road but ended up toppling head-over-heels and crashing the ground . The cyclist, who apparently escaped uninjured, crashed to the floor after cycling while trying to take his coat off . The jacket gets caught in the cyclist's front wheel and he ends up performing a somersault on the busy street - right in front of a fellow biker who captures the whole incident on his head cam . The jacket gets caught in the cyclist's front wheel and he ends up performing a somersault on the busy street - going straight over his handle bars and crashing to the ground. Other misdemeanours featured on the three-minute video entitled 'York Cyclists' include bikers cutting-up motorists, riding without their hands on the handlebars, going the wrong way up one-way streets, using their mobile phones while pedalling, riding on footpaths and jumping red lights. The man said he has been cycling in York for 30 years and has become increasingly concerned about the reckless behaviour of some cyclists. ‘I am tired of watching cyclists breaking the rules of the Highway Code and endangering not only themselves but other road users,’ he said. The man also spotted several people talking on their mobile phones while cycling, pictured, or attempting to text while keeping one hand on the bike . The man, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of any backlash from other cyclists, bought the head cam to film the incidents after getting fed up of the behaviour of his fellow bikers . The anonymous man said he was fed up with other cyclists ignoring the highways code - like this biker who cycled straight through a red light . He revealed his short film was only the first episode and he would be creating more - not just about bad cycling but also bad behaviour by motorists and even pedestrians. It comes just days after new bike lights which display the international symbol of the cyclist were introduced. Hailed a breakthrough in road safety, the ‘Brainy Bike Lights’, by Professor Crawford Hollingworth, use bright LED lighting to allow motorists to see bikers quicker. Around 19,000 cyclists are injured in accidents in the UK each year, with six killed in London over a 14 day period last year. The most common bike collision involves cars and taxis hitting cyclists from behind. The three minute video entitled 'York Cyclists' also shows bikers cutting up drivers and not paying attention to the road as they cycle along . Other clips from the video show cyclists riding with no hands, pictured, driving the wrong way down a one-way street and riding on pavements . Around 19,000 cyclists are injured in accidents in the UK each year, with six killed in London over just 14 days last year . In 2012, a total of 105 adult cyclists and 13 children were killed on roads in Great Britain, while a further 16,788 adults and 2,185 children were injured. Just last week a cyclist was killed in London after colliding with a lorry at an accident blackspot. The man was apparently hit by the waste truck at the Ludgate circus junction at the bottom of Fleet Street, where six others have died since 2008. Last autumn six cyclists were killed on London's roads in just two weeks leading to calls for more money to be invested in cycle lanes and safety measures. Statistics compiled by the Department for Transport reveal a 10 per cent increase in cyclist fatalities from 2011 to 2012 and a 4 per cent rise in serious injuries. The main said he has been cycling in York for 30 years and had become increasingly concerned about the reckless behaviour of some cyclists - including some who continue to cycle on the pavement .","Man bought head cam after getting fed up with behaviour of other cyclists .

"By . Hugo Gye . The most senior officer of the Titanic to survive the ship's sinking downplayed the cause of the disaster as a 'small low-lying iceberg' in an insurance claim form which has come up for sale. In the unique document, second officer Charles Lightoller wrote that the ship made a 'slight jar' before starting to go down. He also tried to excuse the behaviour of staff who failed to spot the iceberg, denying that they were guilty of 'negligence' or being insufficiently vigilant. Lightoller's insurance claim is believed to have been an attempt to minimise the responsibility of the ship's owner, White Star Line, in order to secure the full payout of $5million (£3million). Document: This is the account of the Titanic's sinking written by second officer Charles Lightoller . Distortion: Lightoller, pictured, apparently tried to minimise the scale of the iceberg which the ship struck . The historic document detailing his account of the disaster is being sold at auction by Henry Aldridge and Sons of Devizes, Wiltshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £12,000. The RMS Titanic sank on the night of April 14, 1912, after it struck an iceberg which was 50-100ft high and 200-400ft wide, with more than 1,500 people dying in the catastrophe - partly thanks to the lack of sufficient lifeboats. The ship was insured by 77 different insurance companies, for a total of $5million, meaning that Lightoller had to fill out a loss sheet as soon as he arrived in New York City. Together with third officer Herbert Pitman, fourth officer Joseph Boxall and fifth officer Harold Lowe, he gave an account of the accident. In the testimony made to Robinson Leech, the notary public for New York, on April 19, Lightoller explained that 'all went well' until 11.45pm on April 14 when the ship struck an iceberg. Account: Lightoller wrote that the ship hit a 'small low-lying iceberg' and made a 'slight jar' Form: The front page of the insurance claim signed by Lightoller and three other officers . He stated: 'The captain was on and off the bridge throughout the watch. A sharp lookout was kept from the crow's nest. 'The ship was on course South 86 degrees West true when the lookouts reported ice dead ahead. 'The first officer immediately starboarded the helm reversed the engines full speed and closed all watertight doors. 'The ship swung to port but struck a 'growler' or small low-lying iceberg with the bluff of her starboard bow, making a comparatively slight jar with a grinding sound.' He went to explain that 'all hands were called on deck' and the lifeboats were filled with women and children. Signed: The four officers were the most senior staff of the ship to survive the deadly disaster . Historic: The sinking of the Titanic was one of the worst maritime disasters in history . Claims for the Titanic totalled £16million - the equivalent of £1.7billion in today's money. The life insurance policy payout to the wife of John Thayer, a prominent businessman from Philadelphia, who drowned in the disaster, was the largest of its time at £31,000. Strangely, his wife died on the same day as when the ship went down - 32 years later on April 15, 1944. William Carter, who survived, claimed £3,100 for his Renault car that sank with the ship. This became the first ever claim for a vehicle damaged in a collision with an iceberg. White Star Line paid out around £2.5million to Titanic claimants - £2.2million to British claimants and £400,000 to Americans. However, people in the US originally filed claims totalling £10million - so only a fraction of this was eventually paid out. He added: 'At 2.20am, April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank, going down bow first in very nearly the same position as when struck. 'The master, chief, first and sixth officers were lost and also all the engineers and the pursers and their staff as well as the chief and second stewards.' Part of the small print signed by the four officers states: 'Any loss, damage or injury which has arisen in any way or manner is solely owing to the accidents and difficulties herein set forth and declared and not to any negligence, want of skill, vigilance or exertion on the part of the deponents or any of the officers or men of the said vessel.' White Star was able to receive a payment of $4.25million - the full value of $5million, minus a deductible of $750,000. One of the main insurance companies that covered the Titanic was Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company of New York, which folded three years ago after failing to recover from claims related to the September 11 terror attacks. Lightoller's insurance claim was one of a haul of historic documents contained in the firm's archives, and was bought by an anonymous dealer who is now selling it in Devizes on April 26. Andrew Aldridge, of Henry Aldridge and Sons, said: 'If you have a car accident we have to fill out an insurance claim form and this form follows the same principle. 'This is the account from the four surviving officers, but intriguingly they appear to underplay the severity of the collision and the size of the iceberg as if to minimise the encounter. 'This could be to try and downplay the negligence potentially - the smaller the iceberg the harder it is to see. 'There is nothing else like this document out there and is another reason why there is this endless fascination with the Titanic story and new information about it emerge so many years later.'","Second officer Charles Lightoller had to file an insurance claim in New York .

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . Under cover of darkness, a team of Taliban fighters creep out to bury a deadly improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. The four insurgents intend to wreak death and destruction by blowing up a convoy of US and Afghan troops travelling along the dirt road unaware of the danger ahead. But on this occasion, carnage was averted... thanks to RAF fast jets. Scroll down for video... The Tornado GR4 is both a powerful warplane, and a psychological tool, as proved by the most recent Taliban IED event . The images taken from 10,000 ft in the air, showing the insurgents planting the IED in the road, before they are scared away by the jet flying only 100 ft above their head . One Tornado GR4 aircraft’s state-of-the-art cameras spotted the would-be killers planting the homemade bomb. Seconds later, a second British warplane roared just 100ft above the insurgents’ heads in an intimidating show of force, causing them to flee in terror. Using information from the jets’ advanced Litening III surveillance pod, which sends real-time images to commanders, coalition forces were able to locate and destroy the hastily-buried bomb. The extraordinary footage has been released for the first time by the Ministry of Defence. A Tornado GR4 aircraft's cameras spot fighters planting the bomb under cover of darkness, using infra-red cameras . The insurgents gather around the area where they are planting the IED, unaware they are being watched . The insurgents begin to spot the GR4 as it roars overhead, but continue to attempt to deploy their IED . The dramatic video illustrates the . array of capabilities available to UK troops to smash the Taliban's . bomb-making networks and protect International Security Assistance Force . soldiers. The incident took place on March 10 and involved jets from the RAF's II (AC) Squadron deployed in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan. The British aircrews had been tasked to support the convoy as it moved through Herat Province, in the west of the wartorn country, following an earlier IED blast. Flight Lieutenant Geoff Williams, who . flew one Tornado, said: 'Identifying insurgent activity from 10,000 feet . can be challenging but in this case it was clearly suspicious. 'Two . people on a motorbike rendezvoused with two others waiting by a small . bridge. They collected items stored under the bridge and began digging . in the road.' Aware the insurgents were planting a . roadside bomb, Ft Lt Williams flew low and fast and fired flares to . frighten the insurgents who scattered on motorbike. He said: 'Having been startled by our jet noise the insurgents fled by motorbike. The whole event was over in a minute. 'The . presence of a Tornado provides a huge psychological impact, reassuring . ISAF troops and the civilian population, and sparking fear in the . insurgents.' A few of the Taliban insurgents abandon their attempt, trying to escape using a vehicle (top left), while others hang back . The rest of the insurgents scatter as the GR4 Tornado whizzes over their heads, leaving the IED on the road, which is tracked through heat signatures using their incredibly high tech cameras . Wing Commander Jez Holmes, II(AC) Squadron's officer commanding who piloted the second aircraft in the mission, said: 'The troops found enough explosives to have caused multiple casualties among coalition forces or the local civilian population. 'It’s good to have removed that threat.' The Tornados did not fire missiles at the insurgents so they could exploit evidence from the IEDs and gather intelligence on who was laying them. US Sergeant Louis Awua, a forward air controller with the Texas-based 2nd Battalion, 5th Infantry of the 1st Armoured Division which had troops in the convoy, said: 'When the Brits do shows of presence they almost scrape the ground. 'They fly so low you don't know what it means. 'What I like is the quality of the pilots and the quality of the sensors. They report everything that they see.' The heavily-armed Tornado GR4s are based at Kandahar Airfield as part of the RAF’s 904 Expeditionary Air Wing. Sqn Tornado GR4 crew.

The officer Commanding 2 Squadron, Wing Commander Jez Holmes in the cockpit of a Tornado GR4 prior to take off at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan. Wing Commander Holmes was one of the members of the GR4 that scared away the Taliban fighters . They are routinely called on to support ground forces across Afghanistan. Although the aircraft can use precision weapons such as devastating Hellfire missiles to target insurgents, many contacts with the enemy involve using non-lethal shows of force and presence. Earlier in March II(AC) Squadron Tornado GR4s were involved in another life-saving operation using the Litening III pod. The device provided Afghan forces with aerial surveillance of insurgents who were firing on them, pinpointing the enemy's position to give the ANSF a tactical advantage during the battle. The Tornados' missions are commanded by 83 Expeditionary Air Group, based in the Middle East. Wing Commander Graham Pemberton, Chief of Staff (Operations) at 83 EAG, said: 'The IED incident is a fantastic example of the GR4's flexibility, speed and capability. 'It is always satisfying to know our aircrew have made a real difference to our colleagues on the ground.'","Taliban insurgents were trying to blow up a convoy of US and Afghan troops .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . The contents of a leaked classified report which lists interrogation methods used by the CIA has revealed that Red Hot Chili Peppers' songs were played to terrorism suspects in a bid to extract information. Two officials from the Senate Intelligence Committee have leaked the details of the classified report which allegedly shows that terrorism targets were secretly held and interrogated at Guantanamo Bay's Camp Echo. The suspects at Camp Echo before being flown to Morocco and then back to Guantanamo. Scroll down for video . Songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers were used by the CIA to glean information from one of the terrorism suspects. Pictured here Anthony Kiedis and Michael 'Flea' Balzary from the band . Suspects were also held at other 'black sites' including on U.S. military base Diego Garcia island in the Indian Ocean as well as an alleged site in Poland. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that the methods, known as survival evasion resistance escape techniques (SERE), were an imitation of communist regime torture methods. Techniques used included: sleep, food, water and medical deprivation as well as a 'use of threats'. The process aims to weaken the person's ability to resist interrogation. The SERE programme states that by isolating the captive, the person develops a 'dependency' on the interrogator. Violence was allegedly also used. But according to the sources, one man was subjected to all 10 interrogation techniques identified in  an August 2002 Justice Department memo. A cell at Camp Echo where detainees are held after they have been formally charged. The camp is located in Guantanamo Bay. The report reveals that 10 targets were secretly held and questioned at the site . Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, was leased by the British as a U.S. military site in 1966. The island was also allegedly used as a 'black site' Zain Abidin Mohammed Husain Abu Zubaydah, the officials allede, was subjected to methods which went further than the prescribed guidelines. Examples include keeping Abu Zubaydah awake for longer than the recommended 11 days and pouring cold water on his naked body to prevent him from sleeping. It is alleged that the suspect was then put into a cage used to detain animals at airports, before being subjected to loud music. This is not the first time music has been used as a tactic to interrogate suspects. In 2003, Iraqi prisoners of war who would not cooperate were subjected to music by Metallica as well as music from Sesame Street and Barney. Hit songs by the band include Can't Stop and By the Way, both released in 2002 - the same year as the alleged methods . A former interrogator told the Qatari . broadcaster that the music used in the case of Abu Zubayadah was by the Red Hot Chili . Peppers. Hits by the band include Californication and Can't Stop. Songs By the Way and Can't Stop were both released in 2002 - the year Abu Zubayadah alleges he was held. One interrogator told Al Jazeera: 'Interrogators were being pressured - You have to get info from these people.' Abu . Zubayadah's attorney said that he hoped that the report would back-up . his client's previous claims about the methods used during interrogation.","Methods allegedly used at CIA 'black sites' - secret detention centres .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Former Hey Dad! co-star Sarah Monahan, 36, spoke out against Robert Hughes in a very personal interview on 2day FM this Thursday. The former child star was one of the many victims who suffered Hughes' sexual abuse on the set of Hey Dad!, which began to air in 1987. In her interview, Ms Monahan revealed what she would like to happen to Hughes, 65, who was convicted of 10 child sex offences on Tuesday. Sarah Monahan, 36, appeared on 2DayFM on Thursday to talk about how Hey Dad! co-star Robert Hughes sexually abused her . (From left to right: Merrick Watts, Sophie Monk, Sarah Monahan,Jules Lund) 'I would definitely sentence him to jail and I wouldn't give him one of the cushy jails,' Ms Monahan said. 'I definitely think he needs to go to a place where he thinks about what he's done and realises that maybe he's not the most awesome human being on the planet, and that...he realises he's just a piece of s**t.' Monahan, now living in San Antonio, Texas, was only 10 years old when she claims Hughes first exposed himself in front of her. She told the Sydney's Downing Centre court that the convicted sex offender would inappropriately grope her and expose himself to her during production breaks on the set of Hey Dad! During her interview on 2Day FM, the ex-child star also commented on Hughes' non-remorseful demeanor during his trial. Sex-abuse victim: Monahan also appeared on A Current Affair with the former cast of Hey Dad! on Wednesday night . 'I think that the fact that he's still just so adamantly denying it, he's almost denying the other girls that right to heal a little bit,' she said. Monahan's bravery was praised by 2Day FM show host Sophie Monk, due to choosing to see her abuser face to face in order to help bring her some closure over the ordeal. When asked how she felt about finally seeing the actor again, Monahan described how she was sickened by the sight of Hughes. 'I just wanted to throw up most of the time really...by the third day I couldn't eat, the police would bring me lunch and I just couldn't eat at all...' she said. 'I thought at least when I speak and I'm right there, he has to look back at me to see me say those things, and so I kind of big dogged him at one point because the first couple of days he was staring me down and I couldn't look at him. Then I started looking at him, and he stopped looking back.' Clockwise from centre front: Robert Hughes, Simone Buchanan, Christopher Truswell, Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, and Sarah Monahan . A current scandal: Tracy Grimshaw on the set of A Current Affair with Grimshaw and (clockwise from top left) Christopher Truswell, Simone Buchanan, Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer and Sarah Monahan with air on Wednesday night . Ms Monahan, who described the court process as an 'awful... soul- crushing experience' said that she was going home on Sunday, having had enough of the whole ordeal. '[I] don't want to deal with it anymore,' she said, describing how she had initially wanted to 'tell people and yell' after being forced to stop communicating about what had happened to her, so as not to influence the case during the police investigation. Monahan first went public with her story of abuse four years ago in a Woman's Day article in March 2010. 'I was asked to speak and I finally started talking and it was like a Pandora’s Box, because when you start talking it's kind of hard to stop,' she said. Now part of a campaign that calls for a public register of sex offenders across Australia, Monahan left the show by encouraging victims of child sexual assault to speak up against their perpetrators. 'Don’t let them continue doing it, because it’s not just you, like we’ve seen here. They say for every paedophile that gets done, it takes 60 people before someone speaks up,' she said. Robyn Gardiner, the partner of actor Robert Hughes (right), looked in shock as she left Downing Centre District Court on Monday after he was convicted of a string of child sex charges . Robert Hughes in Hey Dad!: The court heard from a number of Hughes' former colleagues who accused the former star of repeatedly exposing himself . Monahan was one of the principal cast members of TV sitcom Hey Dad! who appeared on A Current Affair on Wednesday night, following leading actor Hughes, 65, being convicted of child sex offences on Tuesday. Some of the show's former actors say members of the Australian acting industry ostracised them after they spoke out about Robert Hughes' child sex abuse. Actor Ben Oxenbould said acting contacts he had known for 30 years turned their back on him when he spoke out in support of his cast member, Monahan. 'Four years ago after we spoke I copped a lot of criticism from people, particularly in the industry saying you idiot you'll never work again,' he said. 'I've had Executive Producers say ""Benny we wanted you for that role, but mate ..."" and I think but mate what?  I'm not the bad guy here. 'My lesson in professionalism was ""shut up about the paedophile"".'","Ex-child star Sarah Monahan said she felt physically sick during the trial .

"By . Rebecca Camber, Crime Reporter . A couple of schoolboys sparked a bomb scare after smuggling First World War artillery shells on a flight from London to Chicago as a souvenir from their school trip. Airport security chiefs at Heathrow were criticised yesterday after it emerged that the munitions hidden in two suitcases were allowed through scanners. The two shells were only flagged up when the United Airlines flight landed in Chicago, where the group of American schoolchildren stopped en route to Seattle. Security workers at Chicago O’Hare International Airport spotted the shells as they scanned luggage and it led to a major security alert. Baggage claim: Two World War I artillery shells discovered by baggage screeners in checked luggage that arrived on a flight from Heathrow at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport . Odd import: The teens told law enforcement they obtained the shells at a French World War I artillery range. It was not clear how . Bomb disposal crews from Chicago Police and the FBI rushed to the airport at 3.40pm on Monday to examine the shells, which could have caused a huge explosion if found to be live. After evacuating the baggage room, explosives experts declared the shells inert and therefore harmless. Despite the fact that United Airlines bans even inert munitions from being carried on its flights, Heathrow allowed the shells through. Yesterday, a spokesman for the airport claimed its scanners are so sophisticated they were able to tell the shells posed no risk. In Chicago, police held the two boys aged 16 and 17 for questioning before releasing them without charge. They insisted they just wanted to keep a souvenir of their European school trip. Historical artefacts: Transportation Security Administration officers at O'Hare Airport spotted two military-grade shells in the checked baggage of two schoolboys, who were part of a field trip returning from London . Checking out: Security officials says the bags belonged to a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old who were returning from a school field trip to Europe. A bomb disposal crew determined the shells were inert and no one was ever in danger . The classmates, thought to be from a school in Seattle, told officers that they took the shells from an artillery range next to a museum that collects war memorabilia in France . It is not known how they then transported the shells from France to Britain before they boarded at Heathrow. Experts confirmed the shells were French and date back to the First World War. The teenagers, who had each stashed a shell in their check-in suitcases, were later released and allowed to travel home to Seattle – but minus the shells. Yesterday, Jim McKinney, from the US Transportation Security Administration in Chicago said: ‘The kids were keeping them as souvenirs. They were held for a brief time before being released.’ Suspect objects: FBI and Chicago Police officers evacuated the baggage room until the items could be clears as inert and interviewed the two minors . Aviation expert Chris Yates said last night: ‘This security breach is a cause for concern. Those who are responsible for the security process should be taken to task. These munitions, even though they were found to be inert, should have been taken off and destroyed.’ A spokesman for Heathrow said: ‘Safety is of paramount importance to Heathrow. We have the world’s most advanced airport scanning equipment. It is designed to pick up actual threats such as explosive material, whereas these were inert items that posed no threat.’ Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that a London museum had to be evacuated amid fears of a similar Second World War shell exploding. The shell had been on display at  Chertsey Museum before workers realised it was dangerous and removed it.","Shells made it through Heathrow security on flight to Chicago .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Bronx physical education teacher insists she was fired after refusing to have a threesome with her boss and boss’ boyfriend, she claims in a lawsuit filed this week. Carisa Gaylardo, 31, was canned from the Riverdale/Kingsbridge Academy last year for what boss Sofia Memos, 41, called a ‘flirtatious’ relationship with a student, but she claims in a lawsuit that is a lie meant to cover up her refusal against repeated sexual advances. The student’s family immediately defended the terminated teacher against the accusations, calling her a great mentor and role model while trying to help salvage her six-year career with city schools. Fired: Carisa Gaylardo claims in a lawsuit that she was fired for refusing kinky advances from another gym teacher . Gaylardo was suspended March 2013 after refusing to step down amid accusations the relationship between her and the female student was inappropriate, court documents cited by the New York Daily News claim. The firing was made final in a hearing last month, according to the paper. It was then Gaylardo found out Memos was behind the termination. She and the teen had exchanged 1,000 messages in the month leading up to the termination, but Gaylardo told Memos she was mentoring the girl on the struggles of juggling three sports and schoolwork. The student and her mother immediately wrote letters defending the under fire instructor. ‘It is wrong that such a good person...is suffering simply for helping me with my struggles,’ wrote the girl. Her mother called Gaylardo ‘a blessing to my daughter and the rest of our family,’ and said ‘She is the greatest role model in my daughter's life.’ Memos disregarded the two letters and forced the Gaylardo to resign ‘based on the sheer number of the texts,’ according to the Daily News. Named in the suit: Gym teacher Sofia Memos repeatedly tried to pressure Gaylardo into three-way sex with her boyfriend, the lawsuit claims . The scorned superior then filed a scathing complaint about their relationship with the city Department of Education. ‘I have observed a rapport between them that had made me feel uncomfortable,’ wrote Memos, calling their relationship ‘flirtatious.’ ‘Gaylardo’s unprofessionalism has only encouraged it by allowing (the student) to come into our office on many occasions to just chat,’ she continued. ‘I have witnessed them giggling and laughing together many times.’ Gaylardo’s suit says the accusations are ‘false and particularly curious and disconcerting because Memos herself had actually propositioned [Gaylardo] by text message and in person to engage in an inappropriate romantic and salacious relationship with her and her boyfriend.’ Where it happened: The Riverdale/Kingsbridge Academy is where Gaylardo worked until being fired last year . The Department of Education retroactively fired Gaylardo after giving her an unsatisfactory rating. She was also added to a list of people ineligible to teach in city schools ‘simply on the frequency of communications without any finding of inappropriate contact or intent.’ Gaylardo’s lawsuit calls for the black mark to be removed from her record, her firing rescinded and back pay and benefits awarded. A student interviewed outside the school by the Daily News said the two teachers appeared to hate each other. ‘I never saw them get along,’ said the eighth-grader. ‘It is tragic that (Gaylardo) lost her career and livelihood… because she was overzealous in helping a student struggling with the pressure of high school,’ says her suit. The city told the paper it will ‘eview the lawsuit and respond accordingly.’ Memos could not be reached for comment.","Carisa Gaylardo was canned last month after being suspended last year for a 'flirtatious' relationship with a student .

"By . James Rush . This public toilet is clearly not for everybody desperate to spend a penny. The local council has been flooded with complaints from larger locals who say they are unable to get through the 20-inch doors to access the facility. Authorities in the city of Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan province, said they decided to install the toilet there more than 20 years ago because of an urgent need for more public facilities. A city council in China has been flooded with complaints from larger locals who have said they are unable to get through the thin doors of these toilets . But they claim it has only become more of a problem because people are now more overweight. There is only enough space in the corridor for a single person to go in and out of the toilet at any one time, while queues can form during winter as people try to force themselves in while wearing thick jumpers and woolly coats. Local council official Guang Yao, whose department operates the toilet, said they had decided to put the toilet there two decades ago because there was an urgent need for more public facilities but there was very little space. He said: 'It was less of a problem then because people were not so overweight as they are now, and there was not so many people using it so they had time to come in and go out. There is only enough space in the corridor for a single person to go in and out of the toilet at any one time, while queues can form during winter as people try to force themselves in while wearing thick jumpers and woolly coats . 'We have tried several times to modify the toilet to make it more convenient but there really is not space to do very much, and we decided to leave it because it's better to have a facility that some people can use occasionally rather than nothing at all. 'The bottom line is that land is very scarce here in the district and our options are very limited. 'Because there are a lot of residential properties here in the area a lot of people walk past, and the toilet is in great demand even if it's not available to everyone.'","Authorities in Chengdu, China, decided to install toilet there 20 years ago .

"By . Meghan Keneally . One of Manhattan's top restaurants has revealed that it's staff prepares for each service by scouring the internet for clues about their upcoming diners. Eleven Madison Park has been ranked among the best restaurants in New York- and the world- since its opening in 1998 but they have continued to adapt and try to best the competition by virtually stalking their guests. This level of service comes with a price, however, as meals at the contemporary American restaurant regularly run upwards of $225-per-person, not including wine. Setting the scene: Eleven Madison Park, first opened in 1998, has been known for its impeccable service as much as they are known fro their food . New York magazine describes how maitre d' Justin Roller spends hours using Google to find out as much about their guests before they step in the door to the Madison Square Park restaurant. He looks at birth dates, wedding anniversaries, hometowns and employment to try to get a sense of how they can make their night special. If it's an anniversary, . Roller tasks himself to try and figure out which anniversary. He looks to see if they are interested in wine- posting photos with wine glasses or any links to brands that they like. 'If I find out a guest is from Montana, and I know we have a server from there, we'll put them together,' he told New York. The restaurant is run by current co-owners, chef Daniel Humm and Will Guidara. All the details: The menu changes daily based on the seasons and the tastes of the individual . Making every meal special: In addition to the standard courses on their tasting menu, they serve creative amuse bouche tasters to set the mood for the meal . Their waitstaff training process is known to be gruelling and even the most experienced servers who have managed other well-established restaurants are ordered to spend months on the most seemingly menial tasks. From polishing silver during nightly service to scooping out servings of granola that is gifted to diners in mason jars at the end of the meal, every tiny detail is granted the same level of importance as that of the actual interaction with guests. And even once the staff have 'graduated' to the level where they are split into teams of four and granted the responsibility to watch over a section of seven or eight tables, maintenance checks continue to keep them on their toes. Institution: The tasting menu-only restaurant was featured in Sex and the City . The waitstaff has a 'family meal' before each service where sommelier Caleb Ganzer quizzes them about the 131-page wine list. 'There's nothing wrong with us being the star of the show.' co-owner Guidara told New York. Experts in the field have determined that the dedication to service at the Madison Square Park restaurant has paid off, and they've won every award in the industry. Humm won the James Beard Award for outstanding chef in 2012, they were named the fifth best restaurant in the world by San Pellegrino, and have been awarded perfect scores by both the New York Times and the Michelin Guide.","Eleven Madison Park staffers search for clues about the diners- hometowns, birth dates, industries- before they have their meal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new exercise book called The Pregnant Athlete shows women in their second and third trimester flipping truck tires, swinging large hammers and leaping over barbells. Written by CrossFit instructor Brandi Dion, and her exercise scientist husband Steven Dion, the book is no way intended for exercise novices - but is it taking the idea of working out during pregnancy too far? 'We were just documenting what I did during my two pregnancies,' Mrs Dion told ABC.  'We wanted to show women who are already in great shape that they can maintain a high level of fitness during pregnancy.' A new exercise book called The Pregnant Athlete shows women in their second and third trimester flipping truck tires, swinging large hammers and leaping over barbells . In recent years, a growing number of women have chosen to continue their exercise programs throughout pregnancy, and Mrs Dion emphasizes that she would not recommend following her book if 'you aren’t already doing it.' The couple also recommend that pregnant women follow their doctor’s advice and listen to their own body in order to pull back from any . movement that doesn’t feel right. Mrs Dion admitted that 'half the exercises in the book would have warnings,' which are nowhere to be seen. In 1985, the American College of . Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published its guidelines for . prenatal exercise, cautioning women not to exceed a maximum heart rate . of 140 beats per minute. 'We wanted to show women who are already in great shape that they can maintain a high level of fitness during pregnancy' Dr. Raul Artal, a lead author of the . ACOG guidelines for exercise and pregnancy, said that mothers-to-be . should simply ask themselves how much risk they want to take. 'Consider that activities with a high . risk of injury in someone who isn’t pregnant will have the risk . amplified by some unknown factor for pregnant women,' he said. When it comes to the effect of exercise . on the fetus, there are three main areas of concern: hyperthermia, sports . injuries and oxygen deficit. While exercise dramatically increases body . temperature, where the fetus can take on the mother's heat, possibly . leading to birth defects, there is no research to prove that exercise at high intensities leads to an . increase in birth defects. Similarly, although studies have shown . that when unfit women . exercise at very high intensity levels, uterine blood flow decreases to . the point where the fetus experiences a serious oxygen deficit, this . has been shown to rarely occur when the pregnant woman is fit. Written by CrossFit instructor Brandi Dion, and her exercise scientist husband Steven Dion, the book is no way intended for exercise novices - but is it taking the idea of working out during pregnancy too far? To prevent oxygen deficit to the fetus, they ought to breathe normally during strength . training, because any act of breath holding can reduce oxygen delivery to the placenta. Sports injuries are also a concern. Doing deep squats, for example, is more likely to cause knee pain in pregnant women because of hormonal changes that can soften and weaken the joints, said Dr Artal. The Pregnant Athlete aims to provide practical information on how a woman's body changes each month and how to gauge their own limits with workout plans for strength, cardiovascular conditioning, agility, and balance for each stage of pregnancy. While it is true that the duration, type and intensity of the exercise that pregnant women perform can all affect the fetus’s heart rate, the ACOG emphasizes that is they train regularly, the fetus will be better conditioned and able to adapt to the stresses of exercise. 'The concern arises when a woman performs extreme levels of exercise on an inconsistent basis: then, the effect can be detrimental to the fetus,' explains the ACOG website.",New book The Pregnant Athlete was written by CrossFit mom Brandi Dion .

Graham Eyes has created a bizarre range of Scotch Creme Eggs - a Cadbury’s Creme Egg wrapped in . sausage meat - or not, for those watching their waistlines - and . flavoured with a variety of seasonings. Graham, from Southport, Merseyside, has created the wacky Easter-themed snacks in a bid to entice more customers through the doors of his shop. Quirky: Graham Eyes, pictured with his son Harry, has created a Cadbury's Creme Egg, wrapped in sausage meat - or not, for those watching their waistlines - and flavoured with a variety of seasonings . The 53-year-old is renowned for his unusual concoctions and after the success of last year’s Cadbury’s Mini Egg sausages, he decided to put his thinking cap on once again. Graham, who opened his first butcher shop more than 30 years ago, said: 'So far I have had mixed reactions from people about the Scotch Creme Eggs. 'Some of my customers can’t wait to try them but other people think they just sound disgusting. 'Personally I think they are really tasty, I really like them - they’ve got a really interesting taste. 'You’ve got the sweetness from the chocolate, contrasting with the chilli and lime that we use in the coating - but the flavours go really well together.' Tasty treat? The creative butcher has created the wacky Easter-themed snacks in a bid to entice more customers through the doors of his shop . The sweet treats are sold ready to be cooked at home and can be cooked in the oven or deep fat fryer. Graham has even dreamed up four different variations of the strange snack to make sure that there is something for everyone. The first is a Scotch Creme Egg coated in breadcrumbs, and for the slimmers there is an offering without any breadcrumbs. For the more adventurous eaters, there is a Scotch Creme Egg coated in sweet chilli. And finally Graham has created one using his special ‘wonder sausage’ mix with a crushed creme egg inside. Joker: Graham has even dreamed up four different variations of the strange snack, including chill and lime, to make sure that there is something for everyone . Bizarre: Graham and his team try to do something unusual for every special occasion - they've already got something in the pipeline for Wimbledon and for St George's Day . He added: 'We always like to do something a bit funky to get people talking. I just wanted to do something to keep the customers coming into the shop by offering them something they can’t pick up in the supermarkets. 'And last year we had a lot of success with the Easter egg sausages, especially with children. 'So we had a think about what we could do this Easter and came up with the idea of the Scotch Creme Egg. 'We try to do something unusual for every special occasion, and we’ve already got something in the pipeline for Wimbledon and for St George’s Day.' The innovative butcher has even offered his loyal customers the chance to name the one of a kind invention.

"By . Helena Powell . Two years ago I suddenly found myself, for the first time in my adult life, in a position where I didn’t need to work. Over dinner one evening my husband, Rupert, announced that he was earning enough money for me to stop working. ‘You could stay at home and look after the children,’ he said, before adding rather nervously, ‘if you want.’ Rupert was right to be apprehensive. What he was suggesting was anathema to everything I’d been brought up to believe in and everything I’d assumed to be right about women’s roles in the 21st century. Life balance: Helena at home with two of her children . As the daughter of a feminist single mother who ran a publishing company, it was drilled into me from a young age that women should be self-sufficient and have high ambitions. I was led to believe that working was the way you defined who you were and how you justified your existence. Women who didn’t work were, well, not only lazy gold-diggers, but letting the side down. When people asked me as a child what I wanted to be, my answer was never ‘a rich man’s wife’ or a ‘lady that lunches’. No, I wanted to be a vet, or a writer or, at times, a brain surgeon. In fact, looking back, I’m not even sure I did really want to be any of those things but like most women of my generation I had been brought up to believe I should work, and what is more, I should want to work. But now? I wonder if all women don’t secretly long to be in a position where they don’t have to work. Few would admit it, but as I learned myself the truth is that not working not only makes your life more pleasant, it enables you to be a better mother and wife. As it was, my first response to Rupert was one of utter disbelief. I was the editor of a woman’s magazine. Why on earth would I want to give up a lucrative, apparently dream role? I dismissed his generous offer out of hand. But the next day I analysed my day in the office and the effect working was having on my life. I no longer had time to exercise. Once I was back from the school-run, going to the gym for half-an-hour hardly seemed worth it. Each morning I was greeted by my boss whose nickname was (and probably still is, unless she’s grown) the poisoned dwarf. She normally had some irritating comment to make on whatever I was working on. 'It’s not that we working mothers . really think they’re inferior — it’s actually that we want to be them.' In the afternoon I had the inevitable, fraught calls from the three children aged between eight and 12 who, once home, were at each other’s throats with only a terrified nanny to separate them. In the evenings, by the time I had calmed everyone down and listened to their gripes, I was far too exhausted to even have a conversation with my husband. Perhaps I had been a little hasty. ‘You’re on,’ I told Rupert the very next day. My first day at home a few months later was a revelation. I got up, gave everyone breakfast, took the kids to school, went to the gym, even chatted to a talkative friend I bumped into. Normally I’d have been so busy and stressed I would have hidden behind my locker so as not to see her and feel obliged to chat. Shockingly, after just one morning, I had turned into one of them. By them, I mean women who don’t work. Those that I had formerly viewed as the enemy — in part because of my feminist upbringing but also, I now  realise, because I was insanely jealous of them. This is the unspoken truth of why a lot of stay-at-home mums come under attack. It’s not that we working mothers really think they’re inferior — it’s actually that we want to be them. I firmly believe a lot of working women would jump at the chance to have some time off, a view that’s backed up by figures. This week it was revealed that the hours worked by married women has been steadily dropping over the past 25 years, despite an increase in the range of jobs and levels of pay available to them. This week it was revealed that the hours worked by married women has been steadily dropping over the past 25 years, despite an increase in the range of jobs and levels of pay available to them. Pictured: stock image . The Government estimates  more than a third of working mothers would like to quit their jobs if they could. Some mums stick to their careers even when they don’t need to because, as Claire, one of my new stay-at-home-mum friends, put it: ‘They would rather be working than looking after their children.’ Claire told me she could always spot which children had mothers who worked and which had mums who didn’t. ‘The ones who have working mothers are so much more fraught,’ she told me. ‘It’s like they’re tight little springs waiting to unravel.’ While before I’d have dismissed her theory out of hand, based on my own experience there is truth in this. When I stopped working, the change in our children was as instantaneous as it was in me. Suddenly there was laughter in the car on the way to school, a ‘see you this afternoon mummy’ as opposed to an anxious ‘will you be home tonight?’. Helena explains: 'Suddenly there was laughter in the car on the way to school, a 'see you this afternoon mummy' as opposed to an anxious 'will you be home tonight?'. Pictured: Helena on holiday with her children . The bickering diminished, there was a tranquil atmosphere that hadn’t been there before. I was calmer, so they were calmer. So wasn’t I worried that I was becoming a nobody? That people wouldn’t take me seriously any more? I remember the first time we went out after my ‘liberation’, as I now call it. Somebody asked me what I did for a living. I was so shocked I couldn’t answer at first. To say I was a magazine editor was of course no longer true. 'I realised that I was frightened to say I was ‘just a mum’ — but why?' ‘I’m between jobs,’ I replied in the end, sounding like some failed Hollywood actress. I realised that I was frightened to say I was ‘just a mum’ — but why? Being a mum, as we all know, is actually the hardest job in the world. Even if you have the boss from hell, you can sometimes ignore him (or her). Try ignoring a two-year-old having a tantrum at your peril. When I was ‘liberated’ my children were eight, 11 and 12 and so I was able to throw myself into trawling round schools with them and prep them for the entrance exams. But, when I wasn’t doing those things, I was doing exactly what I felt like. This included afternoon naps (almost every day), having my nails maintained by the best in the business and lunching with friends I had previously been too busy to see. Generally my life was much more in order. Instead of running around like a headless chicken yelling at everyone, I was in control of myself, my life and my moods. Helena recalls: 'I realised that I was frightened to say I was 'just a mum' - but why?' Pictured: Helena with two of her children in France . We had a kind of equilibrium in our lives I think we had always missed. Looking back on the years when I was working in an office full-time, I would say that at least 70 per cent of arguments and stress were as a result of my having to devote time to work and not the family. An added bonus was that not only were we happier, but my husband was happier too. He seemed to really enjoy his role as sole provider, perhaps in part because it meant he had more of my attention, just like the children. Of course it was not always idyllic or perfect — but I’d be lying if I said that him being the provider and me the wife at home didn’t work better than us both working full-time. In fact, it might have worked rather too well. My diligent tutoring of our children meant that we got them all into the expensive private schools of our choice. So now I have to work to help pay the fees. But, while I might need an income, there’s no way I’m going back into an office full-time. I’ve set up my own PR company and work from home — when it suits me and my family. And yes, my nails are still perfect. Helena’s novel,  The Ex-Factor, is out now.","At first, Helena was too scared to admit she was a stay-at-home mother .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Adoptive parents in Alabama have hit back at state Rep. Alvin Holmes' racist comments that white Republicans would force their child to have an abortion if the father was black. The Democrat sensationally declared during an anti-abortion bill last month that he would mortgage his house and give legislators $100,000 if they showed him 'a whole bunch of whites that adopted blacks in Alabama'. Holmes may need to head to the bank after 'a whole bunch' of parents who've adopted children from other races turned up outside the Alabama State House for a rally yesterday. 'We will never move forward away from racism as long as we have leaders holding on to the past and turning everything into a race issue,' Beverly Owings, who has adopted four children with her husband, including a biracial daughter, said at the rally. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Alabama Democrat Rep. Alvin Holmes caused controversy last month by saying '99 per cent' of white Republicans who are anti-abortion would force their daughter to have one if she got pregnant by a black man . Owings told AL.com that Holmes’ comments were racist and hurtful. 'As a parent, you do everything you can to build your child’s self-esteem, and it is very offensive when someone purposely degrades a certain population of children,' she said. 'Children are not born racist. They learn racism from their environment.' Owings is so passionate about the issue, she and her friend April Hadden set up a Facebook page, Faces of Families in Alabama on April 2 to show 'Holmes and the rest of the world how many families in Alabama have adopted children outside of their own race'. The page has more than 7,800 likes and numerous families have shared their pictures on the wall. 'When my daughter heard (Holmes’s) comments, she said, ‘Mom, what about our family?’ And as a mom, I knew I had to step up,' Owings told Yahoo Shine. 'I had no doubt the families were out there, but I have been in amazement. I can’t believe the response.'

Rally: Protesters gathered outside Alabama State House in Montgomery yesterday to challenge Rep. Alvin Holmes' comments that white families don't adopt black babies in the southern state . Loving family: Tomas and Lorra Roberts Casson who attended the rally have five adopted children (family pictured) Parent Craig Kelley shared a cute picture of his transracial brood, with the caption: 'Five of our eight blessings that came from Alabama adoptions!' Joy Mikell Portis, a mother of eight children, many of whom are adopted, wrote alongside a family portrait: 'Meet our family. We see people, not skin color and there are many more families like ours here in Montgomery and all over the state of Alabama!' Despite the outcry, Holmes has stood by his controversial comments. 'The majority of white people in Alabama are against interracial marriage and they are against adoption of black children,' Holmes said, according to AL.com. Holmes made the comments during a heated debate early last month for an anti-abortion bill which was subsequently approved by the Alabama House of Representatives. If the bill wins approval, abortion will be banned once a fetal heartbeat is detected, something which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The International Space Station (ISS) was forced to dodge a deadly field of space junk last week after debris came within 1,000 feet (0.3km) of its orbit. On Thursday, the Expedition 39 astronauts raised the altitude of the ISS by half a mile (0.8km) to prevent a Gravity-style disaster. Nasa said the astronauts fired 53 thrusters at on the ISS’ Zvezda Service Module for three minutes, 40 seconds to complete the manoeuvre. The International Space Station (ISS) was forced to dodge a deadly field of space junk last week after debris came within 1,000 feet (0.3km) of its orbit . This was enough to prevent the space station from colliding with parts of an old Ariane 5 rocket which was launched by the European Space Station. This is the second time in less than three weeks that the ISS has had to sidestep space junk. Nasa spokesman Kelly Humphries said the space agency has had to consider sidestepping space junk dozens of times since the outpost was launched in 1998, sometimes cancelling the orbital dodge at the last moment. On Thursday, the Expedition 39 astronauts raised the altitude of the ISS by half a mile (0.8km) to prevent a Gravity-style disaster. In the film In 'Gravity' two astronauts are left drifting in the void after a collision between satellite debris and their spacecraft . Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. It is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph. One major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In February 2007 for instance, a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia. More recently, the GOCE satellite, also known as the ‘Ferrari of space’, made a fiery fall to Earth in November last year. The station also moved on March 16 this year to avoid an old Russian weather satellite part. And the problem is only set to get work. Last year, Nasa said the amount of space junk orbiting Earth has reached a tipping point. This junk – which can include anything from old rockets, abandoned satellites to missile shrapnel - will soon make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet, the space agency claims. There are currently around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. Overall, it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph. As well as this, there are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they can’t be tracked. Even tiny paint flecks can damage a spacecraft when travelling at these velocities. A number of space shuttle windows have had to be replaced because of damage caused by material that was analysed and shown to be paint flecks. ‘The greatest risk to space missions comes from non-trackable debris,’ said Nicholas Johnson, Nasa chief scientist for orbital debris. Since the space age began 54 years ago, civilisation has littered the area just above Earth's atmosphere with leftover boosters and other parts that come off during launches, as well as old satellites. Many pieces of space junk fall back down to Earth, but most burn up on re-entry. It is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph . One major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In February 2007 for instance, a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia. The booster had been carrying an Arabsat-4A communication satellite but malfunctioned before it could use all of its propellant creating a cloud of space debris. Based on a data archive, each miniature sphere in this image represents an existing object orbiting in space. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track . More recently, the GOCE satellite, also known as the ‘Ferrari of space’, made a fiery fall to Earth in November last year. Its debris fell along a path through East Asia and the Western Pacific to Antarctica but no one was hurt. Several solutions to retrieving or moving the space junk have been put forward including giant cosmic versions of harpoons, nets, tethers, magnets and even a giant dish or umbrella-shaped device. Mission Control also has the option of taking additional precautions, such as closing hatches between some of the station’s modules, if the likelihood of a collision is great enough.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Anonymity app Secret has made waves since it emerged from Silicon Valley two months ago. The app showcases startling confessions about what a person really thinks but isn’t willing to share on sites like Twitter and Facebook. Now Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg could be about to cash in on the trend by reportedly launching a Secret-like app of his own. Mystery meeting: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has contacted the Secret app founders about the idea, according to sources speaking to Re/code's Mike Isaac . Zuckerberg has even contacted Secret about the idea, according Re/code's Mike Isaac, although he believes this was an acquisition talk. ‘Rumours of a $100 million (£60 million) offer from Facebook to buy Secret that reverberated through Silicon Valley this week were shot down by two people familiar with the social networking giant’s plans,’ said Mr Isaac. The move is a drastic departure from Facebook’s current stance of not allowing users to display fake names. Facebook is yet to comment on the rumours. Confidential: The Secret app allows people to post anonymous . messages - however, their friends are alerted that 'a fiend' has posted, . raising fears the service could be misused . Secret, launched two months ago, was created by two former Google engineers who were looking for a way to let people deliver genuine feedback to co-workers. The app tells users  when a friend has posted a secret — they just don't know which friend. It has been especially popular in Silicon Valley and its satellite technology communities outside of the San Francisco Bay Area. Secret tries to add a layer of accountability to anonymous posts by showing users' secrets to their friends and allowing only friends, or friends of friends, to comment on each shared post. To sign up, users provide their mobile phone number, email address or both. When you post a secret, your phone and email contacts who are also on Secret will be able to see it. If they tap a heart icon indicating that they ‘love’ your secret, then their friends will be able to see it too. You won't know which of your friends is on Secret. Secret says it ensures security by encrypting posts and without uploading contact information to its servers. The app also offers a panic button, called ‘unlink my posts.’ When a user clicks it, any link between them and all previous secrets they have posted is removed. However, in December Bloomberg Businessweek noted that this could be about to change after Facebook hosted a three-day hacker event in which apps that could be used anonymously were developed. The event was part of a project called Facebook Creative Labs with aims to develop a variety of new apps for the social media site. Although anonymity apps are being criticised as platforms for bullying, supporters say they can be tools for preventing mischief. They also have a cathartic value for some users. ‘My baby boy passed away recently. I saw his picture today and cried. I cried because I love him and miss him. I'm a guy, so no one thinks to talk to me,’ read a recent post on Secret. Another recent Secret message read: ‘Fact: It's downright scary to hire your first woman onto an all-male team.’ Steve Jones, a professor who studies online culture and communications at the University of Illinois at Chicago, believes there's a ‘significant degree to which people want to be associated with their words,’ get comments, likes and acknowledgements for them. Anonymity apps, he says, could have a difficult time maintaining a business model because they are exposing themselves to a lot of liability. ‘I don't want to dismiss the optimistic view that the makers of these apps have,’ he said. ‘But I don't have that much evidence yet that these apps are appealing for a better nature.’ Out in the open: The move is a drastic departure from Facebook's current stance of not allowing users to display made-up names .","The Secret app showcases startling confessions about what a person really thinks but isn’t willing to share on sites like Twitter and Facebook .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A size 24 woman has hit back at her critics saying she is 'healthy' and happy with her weight - and has no intention of slimming down. Helen Dee, from Surrey, says the only time she is miserable is when she is on a diet - and would always choose chocolate over an apple because she 'loves food'. She told ITV's Daybreak: 'I do feel healthy, but I know a lot of people will think otherwise. Personally, I feel healthy, happy and do everything I want to do.' 'Healthy': Helen Dee is a size 24 but says she is happy, loves good and has no plans to slim down . But she admitted she does feel great pressure to lose weight. She told  hosts Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones: 'There is such a lot of pressure and some of the comments can be quite hurtful. 'People will say ""you're such a fun girl, it's a shame you're not a lot slimmer"". 'But I'm very lucky and confident and it's water off a duck's back to me.' 'It's . not that I don't want to be helped - I just don't want to diet. For me, . a diet starts on a Monday and stops by a Tuesday. I have zero willpower . and am not going to choose a salad over something greasy. 'I do love life, but even the healthiest people pass away.' Ms Dee spoke out after a new report warned that millions of people in the UK could be failing to recognise that they are obese - putting themselves at risk of early death. The research, conducted by the charity Nuffield Health, found that two-fifths of obese people had no concerns about serious illness due to their weight. Unaware: Ms Dee - with Daybreak's Dr Hilary Jones - spoke out after a new report warned that millions of people in the UK could be failing to recognise that they are obese - putting themselves at risk of early death . Being obese increases the risk of a . number of potentially fatal diseases such as heart disease, some types . of cancer, stroke and type 2 diabetes. But many people simply believe they are overweight instead of clinically obese, a charity spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, 44 per cent of those who are obese said they have no concerns . about serious illness due to their weight. And many did not recognise . the links between obesity and health problems. Eight in 10 of those polled did not know about the link between obesity and some cancers such as breast and bowel cancer. Nuffield Health questioned 3,100 people about their health and well-being - including about perceptions of their weight. Half believed themselves to be overweight and  six per cent thought they were obese. But body mass index (BMI) tests revealed that 17% were clinically obese . - classed as such when they have a BMI score over 30 - and three per . cent measured as 'morbidly obese', with a BMI of 40 or over. The charity said that there is a ""clear misconception"" over what weight is considered to be obese. If . the figures are extrapolated, this means around six million people in . the UK could be at risk by not recognising that they are obese and the . associated health risks, a charity spokeswoman said. Around . two-thirds were unaware about obese people's increase risk of liver . disease or osteoarthritis. And 46 per cent were not aware about the link between . obesity and stroke. Commenting on the report, Dr Hilary Jones told Daybreak: 'People like Helen don't want to indetify the truth in the stats. 'She says she is happy, but I think she could be happier.' He added that a third of morbidly obese people suffer from depression. He said to Ms Dee: 'I do think you could be happier. Do you think you could be happier if you were thinner?' She replied: 'I really don't think it . would make any difference. A few years ago, I was five or six stone . lighter and I felt no different then to now. 'But when I was dieting I was miserable. I love food - if there is chocolate or an apple, I will take a chocolate. 'I'm not saying an apple will make me unhappy, but a chocolate will make me happier. When . asked is she was concerned about the impact of her weight on her . health, she said:'I have heard it time again, not just from doctors but . from my family and friends.

Frank Janssen, a 63-year-old military contractor, was found unharmed in an Atlanta apartment by an FBI rescue team on Wednesday night - five days after he vanished from his North Carolina home. On Thursday, the FBI revealed they were able to rescue him after monitoring phone conversations indicating that the kidnappers planned to kill him and wipe the apartment clean of evidence. 'He spent five nights in the hands of a group of very dangerous people,' Special Agent John Strong said. 'We can only imagine the uncertainty, confusion and fear he experienced.' Scroll down for video . Plot: Frank Arthur Janssen, 63, right, was kidnapped earlier this month allegedly by five gang members who wanted to get back at his daughter, who prosecuted on a case that put their friend behind bars . Raid: An image shows federal agents walking through an apartment complex in Atlanta after the agents rescued Janssen on Wednesday night. He was not harmed in the kidnapping or the rescue . Audience: Neighbors watch as the agents stand guard at the apartment following the raid . The abduction was apparently related to work by his . daughter, Wake County Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen, officials said at Thursday's press conference. It related to the life sentence of 49-year-old Kelvin Melton, a habitual felon who was convicted in October . 2012 of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill in September 2011, records show. Colleen Janssen prosecuted his case in . 2012 and he was sentenced to life in prison. 'Revenge': They were allegedly acting on behalf of Kelvin Melton, who was jailed for assault in 2012 . A federal law enforcement . official said communications between the alleged kidnappers suggested . that those involved - who are between the ages of 19 and 21 - were linked to the gang the Bloods. On . April 5, a heavy-set . woman knocked on Frank Janssen's front door in Wake Forest, North . Carolina and when he answered, he was assaulted with a stun gun and . kidnapped, . authorities said. After the kidnapping, his wife received a text message saying he had been . taken to Georgia in the trunk of a car and was going to California afterwards, WNCN reported. Authorities . say the kidnappers threatened to torture him and sent 'specific . demands' to his wife, as well as a photo of him tied up. The demands . were not revealed. In . other messages, they told her that Janssen would be tortured, chopped up and . sent to her in six boxes if she told police. However, after finding drops of blood outside her home, she had contacted authorities. The . FBI said a coordinated investigation . by the FBI, Wake Forest police and other law enforcement agencies . determined that Janssen had been the victim of a kidnapping and was . being held in an apartment complex in Atlanta's southeast section. Raid: Residents look on as workers repair a neighbor's front door after agents broke it down Wednesday . The next morning: The agents raided the apartment around midnight and five people were arrested . Cruel: The five kidnappers allegedly tied up Janssen and sent a photo to his wife to blackmail her . Probe: FBI agents can be seen gathering evidence from the scene following the successful rescue . Janssen was safely rescued by the highly trained team at about 11.55pm on Wednesday, FBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said. FBI agents remained at the apartments . after sunrise on Thursday. Two doors, which seemed to be charred from . fire or explosives, lay in the apartment courtyard. The investigation in the kidnapping case is . ongoing, but five people have been charged with federal kidnapping . charges. The maximum sentence is life. Clifton James Roberts, 19, Jenna Paulin . Martin, 21, Tiana Maynard, 20, Jevante Price, 20, and Michael Montreal . Gooden, 21, have been arrested in the case. Investigation: John Strong, special agent in charge of the FBI in North Carolina said on Thursday, pictured, that the kidnapping was related to his daughter's prosecution of a convicted felon . Taken: He was hit by a stun gun and kidnapped from his home in North Carolina, pictured, on April 5.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Rumours Apple is on the verge of launching a larger screen iPhone have been circling for months, and now leaked slides reveal exactly why the firm may be looking to this new market. In short, it’s because that’s where the money is. The slides were used by Samsung as part of the current court battle in California between the two rival phone makers, and were published by website Re/Code. They were taken from an Apple planning meeting from April 2013 that plotted the rise in popularity of larger screens, compared to a drop in iPhone growth. Scroll down for video . The slides, pictured, were revealed by Samsung as part of the current court battle in California. They date back to an Apple planning meeting from April 2013. According to one slide, pictured, the smartphone market recently grew by 228 million units. Of this increase, 159 million units were larger, cheaper phones . Reports claim Apple will introduce a new 4.7-inch iPhone alongside a larger 5.5-inch model later this year. The claims are said to have come from sources inside Apple’s supply chain. Apple’s display suppliers, including Sharp and LG, and expected to go into mass production as early as this month. Apple's iPhone 6 is also rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick. On one slide, Apple accused its rivals of spending an ‘obscene’ amount of money on advertising, and claimed consumers want what Apple doesn’t have. Elsewhere, Apple admitted the strongest demand from consumers was coming from ‘less expensive and larger screen smartphones.’ It continued that its competitors have ‘drastically improved their hardware and in some cases their ecosystems.’ According to the slides, between 2011 and 2012, the smartphone market grew by 228 million units.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . For humans in dark places, using touch and feel can help us ‘see’ where we’re going. But for the Mexican blind cavefish, using touch alone isn’t enough. Instead, in the absence of eyes, they’ve evolved an ability to alter the water around them, creating a force field of sorts that alerts them to the presence of obstacles. Suddenly I sea: The Mexican blind cavefish sucks in water at different rates to find out what is in its vicinity . The research was performed by a team at Tel Aviv University, Israel led by Dr. Roi Holzman. When observing the blind cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus) in a tank, they noticed it was continuously opening and closing its mouth every few seconds. This fish is found in Texas and central and eastern Mexico. It is a freshwater fish that grows to a maximum of 4.7 inches (12 centimetres). It spends most of its time at the bottom of creeks and rivers. Its diet is mostly crustaceans and insects. The loss of its eyes through evolution may have allowed the fish to focus more energy on growth and reproduction. The water comes in and is then discharged through their gills. The sucking action, however, had not been noticed before, so Holzman and his team set about understanding why it did this. They found that when they rearranged the objects in the tank, the fish moved much more slowly and sucked more often as it attempted to regain its bearings. At 2.8 inches (seven centimetres) from a large object, the fish sucked twice as fast. When 0.8 inches (two centimetres) away, it sucked six times as fast. ‘We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generate a hydrodynamic velocity field,’ the researchers write in their paper. Once water is sucked in it is then pushed back out through the gills, forming a noticeable pressure wave around the fish. Max power: This fish might remind you of the popular video game character Kirby, who used his sucking ability to destroy obstacles and enemies in his path . The researchers suggest that creating this wave makes the movements of the fish 60 times more accurate than without it. This allows it to be incredibly nimble and agile despite not having eyes. But no one is quite sure why the fish has developed this ability. Some theories suggest it is a 'regressive trait' that has occurred over time. But others think it may simply be part of the evolution process, with the fish losing its eyes as it had no need for them. Whatever the reason, the use of water currents as a tool to 'see' makes this one of the most unique fish in the world.","Mexican blind cavefish has evolved an unusual ability to detect obstacles .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Tickling, over-eating and drinking wedding leftovers from a chamber pot are all marriage-related rituals that make the tradition of saving tier of wedding cake seem completely mundane. An interactive collection of wedding traditions from around the world highlights some very strange practices from the past and the present - including organised weeping before the big day in China, to negotiating the price of a bride in pigs in Papua New Guinea. However, the infographic also serves to highlight the cost of a ceremony and the plight of child brides around the world. Scroll down for interactive infographic . You may now spit at the bride: An interactive collection of wedding traditions from around the world highlights some very strange practices from the past and the present, including organised weeping before the big day in China and spitting at the bride, to negotiating the price of a bride in pigs in Papua New Guinea . In Chinese Inner Mongolia, the bride and groom in the Daur community have to kill a baby chick together in order to set a date for their wedding. There is one parallel with the cutting of the cake in Western wedding ceremonies as the couple have to kill the animal with the same knife – grasping it together. They then inspect the innards of the chick until they locate the liver and if it is in good condition, they can start organising their nuptials. While many Western brides try to shed a few pounds before their big day, the opposite is true in Mauritania, where obesity is traditionally regarded as desirable. Girls as young as five are ‘force-fed’ a diet of rich, fatty foods and older women force brides-to-be to consume enormous amounts in order to make them as attractive as possible to potential suitors. Click on different images in this interactive graphic to learn more about rituals from different parts of the world . The practice of force feeding or ‘Leblouh’ dates from the 11th century when being overweight was a sign of wealth and is still relevant today, according to the PurelyDiamonds.co.uk, the British company that produced the infographic. The father of the bride spits on the breasts and face of his daughter for luck before she is wed in Kenya and members of the Tidong tribe in the city of Sandakan in Sabah, Malaysia are forbidden to go to the toilet for three days before the wedding because they believe that the ritual brings the couple luck and will prevent infidelity and the death of their children. While most weddings are happy occasions, the Tujia people in Sichuan, China cry in advance of a wedding. The bride cries for an hour a day one whole month before she is due to wed and is later joined by her mother and grandmother in her weeping. The tradition is said to stem from the time when a mother of a Chinese princess sobbed profusely at her daughter’s wedding. Pucker up: The infographic highlights unusual traditions such as Sweden's kissing frenzy (illustrated) as well as more serious issues such as the plight of child brides in less developed parts of the world . The big day can also include strange traditions. In India at a certain astrological time, ‘maglik’ women have to marry a banana or peepal tree, or an idol of the Hindu god Visnu in a ceremony known as ‘kumbh vivah’. Once the ceremony has taken place, the tree is destroyed and the ceremony is intended to break any potential curse over the bride and groom. Centuries ago in France, a married couple were sent to bed while the bridal party cleaned up the mess from a raucous reception and collected all the leftover food and drink in a chamber pot – which the happy couple were forced to drink together. It was meant to give them strength and vitality for their wedding night and while the ritual no longer exists, sometimes chocolate and champagne is served out of a vessel that looks like a chamber pot. As well as unusual marriage preparations, the big day can also include strange traditions. In India at a certain astrological time, 'maglik' women have to marry a banana or peepal tree, or an idol of the Hindu god Visnu in a ceremony known as 'kumbh vivah' Before couples can tie the knot, men have to get their girl. In Niger, if a young man is interested in a girl, he will sneak up to the home which she shares with her parents and tickle her ear. Later, a goat is sacrificed at the wedding, which takes place during a full moon, and afterwards, a camel is made to dance for guests to drum beats at a reception. People in remote parts of Papua New Guinea have to negotiate the price of a bride with her parents, which is measured in pigs and shells. ‘Low quality’ brides fetch just one or two pigs, while beauties can be worth more than 30. These pigs are often eaten as part of a wedding feast. A fishy tradition: From negotiating the price of a bride in pigs to crying for days on end, there are many traditions in preparation for the big day but after the main event, some people in Korea beat the soles of the groom's feet with fish to make him stronger for life ahead with his wife . Despite the legal age of consent being 21, Papua New Guinea has the 5th highest rate of child marriages in the world. The infographic includes serious information, such as that one in seven girls is married off before they reach their 15th birthday. In Malaysia, 16,000 girls are married before the age of 15 and in Niger, over one third are married by the same age. The infographic also talks about countries where polygamist marriages are legal and outlines the average cost of weddings in different countries.","An interactive collection of wedding .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Websites and their users have been left reeling this week after a flaw was exposed in a common encryption service. Around two-thirds of websites are vulnerable to so-called ‘heartbleed hackers’, and now a password expert has created a tool to see if your favourite sites are affected. LastPass’ Heartbleed Checker looks to see when a site’s secure encryption certificate was last valid and warns if the server may be at risk. LastPass' Heartbleed Checker, pictured, looks to see when a site's secure encryption certificate was last regenerated and warns if the server may be at risk. It also reveals the websites that either aren't affected by the bug, or have updated their certificates . The heartbleed bug lets hackers eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications. It was found by uncovered by a team of researchers from Google Security and Codenomicon in the OpenSSL cryptographic software. OpenSSL is open-source software that is widely used to encrypt web communications. It is used to protect websites, instant messaging, email servers, virtual private networks and other communications. OpenSSL certificates are also used to protect credit card details on select services. The software is used in two of the most widely used Web servers, Apache and nginx. Research by analytics firm Netcraft found almost 500,000 websites could be affected. In theory, if the site is vulnerable, . any data that has been stored on it since 2011 - when the flaw is . thought to have originated - could be at risk. The tool also reveals the websites that either aren’t affected by the bug, or have updated their certificates. Experts are advising people to change . their passwords, but if a website is still vulnerable, the information . may still be at risk. Changing passwords will work on sites that have been updated, and if your details were stolen before the flaw was identified. It's good practice to change passwords following a vulnerability either way, though. The heartbleed bug lets hackers eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications. It was uncovered by a team of researchers from Google Security and Codenomicon in the OpenSSL cryptographic software. The software offers encryption services, such as when people log into internet banking, or into a webmail service like Yahoo. The fault lets a hacker craft an attack which, under the right . conditions, will return small chunks of information from the . remote system or service. For example, it has been demonstrated that hackers can steal other users’ usernames and passwords from Yahoo - although this flaw has now been fixed. OpenSSL is open-source software that is widely used to encrypt web communications. According to the tool, pictured, Bing.com doesn't use OpenSSL so is not at risk . Instagram runs on the nginx server, which uses OpenSSL software, and its SSL certificate was last valid three years ago. LastPass has flagged it as a potential risk, pictured.

The . software is used in two of the most widely used web servers, including . Apache and nginx, and is said to be used in one way or another by . roughly two-thirds . of all websites. According to the tool, Bing.com doesn’t use OpenSSL so is not at risk. The server details of Facebook and Twitter aren't reported, so LastPass was unable to confirm if they use OpenSSL. However, it warns neither sites' SSL certificate has been updated since the flaw was identified. Yahoo.com, which was confirmed as vulnerable by developers yesterday, has since updated its SSL certificate and is listed as secure again. Instagram runs on the nginx server, which uses OpenSSL software, and its SSL certificate was last valid three years ago meaning LastPass has flagged it as a potential risk. The tool is a guide to affected services; it is not a definitive list. The bug means hackers can eavesdrop and leave no trace in server logs. The flaw was introduced in OpenSSL in December 2011, and was 'in the wild' until Monday, when a new version fixing the flaw was released . The flaw was introduced in OpenSSL in December 2011, and was 'in the wild' until Monday, when a new version fixing the flaw was released.Experts have confirmed the flaw is real. 'We were able to scrape a Yahoo username & password via the Heartbleed bug,' tweeted Ronald Prins of security firm Fox-IT, showing a censored example. Research by analytics firm Netcraft found almost 500,000 websites could be affected. 'The serious overrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic library affects around 17 per cent of SSL web servers,' it said. The . Heartbleed bug lets anyone on the web read the memory of the . systems protected by vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. It compromises secret keys used to identify the service providers and . to encrypt web traffic. This includes the names and passwords of the users and the . actual content, such as credit card numbers. Attackers can 'eavesdrop' on communications between servers, steal data directly . from the them, and use the information to impersonate services and users on other sites or platforms. James Lyne, global head of research at security firm Sophos told MailOnline: 'This fault undermines the fundamental trust on the internet for anyone running the vulnerable software and it is widely . integrated into the technology we all use every day. 'While the fault has now been fixed, providers must apply it manually, so many still are vulnerable. 'Worse still, the defect was in the code for over two years before being discovered by security researchers - attackers could have discovered this at any time during that period and retrieved large volumes of data without anyone knowing. 'At this point the best thing for consumers to do is to assume their passwords and alike have been leaked. They may not have been, but since it's very hard to actually tell retrospectively, it is better to be safe than sorry. 'As providers rush to patch [the flaw], consumers should apply typical IT security best practice: ensure you change passwords - once you know the issue has been fixed by your provider; update your computers; and don't use the same password across multiple sites or services. 'This is not the first defect of its kind and it certainly won't be the last, but it is one of the more serious faults we've seen in recent Internet history.' 'The heartbleed bug allows anyone on the internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software,' according to a website the researchers who found the flaw set up to explain their find. 'This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. 'This allows attackers to eavesdrop communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.' Experts say the bug could leave up to 66% of sites vulnerable to hackers if their encryption software is not updated. It compromises secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt web traffic. This includes the names and passwords of the users and actual content, such as credit card numbers . 'This bug has left large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the Internet,"" they warned. 'Considering the long exposure, ease of exploitation and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously.' Daniel Foster of hosting firm 34SP.com warned firms with eCommerce capabilities to be extra cautious. 'With potentially all web users affected by the recent ‘heartbleed’ security bug that has hit OpenSSL software, which is the software that protects credit card transactions - it is important that eCommerce businesses contact their web hosting providers to check that they have taken necessary actions to avoid their customers being affected by spying and eavesdropping,' he said.","Around two-thirds of websites are vulnerable to ‘heartbleed hackers’

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 30-year-old woman has been accused of fatally stabbing and cutting the genitals off a man she claimed sexually assaulted her. Cristal Paulette Richardson allegedly stabbed 34-year-old Cedric Lamont Owens more than 130 times and sliced his throat with a pocket knife in a Dallas motel room after a night of heavy drinking and drug taking. She also allegedly hacked off his penis and scrotum in the April 28, 2012 attack. 'You're going to see some of the worst pictures of your lifetime,' prosecutor Josh Healy told jurors at Richardson's murder trial, which began Tuesday.  'I don't envy your position.' Charged with murder: Cristal Paulette Richardson, 30 (pictured) allegedly stabbed 34-year-old Cedric Lamont Owens to death and cut off his genitalia in April 2012 . Dallas News reported Richardson pleaded not guilty to the gruesome crime, with defense attorney Paul Johnson saying his client defended herself. On the night before Owens was . slain, prosecutors say he and Richardson met at a convenience store. She had dollar bills pinned to her dress and told him it was her . birthday. It is not clear if the pair were dating or had met for the first time. The court heard that the pair stopped several times that night so Owens could . buy alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and PCP. Prosecutors said the couple . joined three other people for a party at Motel 6 on Interstate 30 . near Jim Miller Road in Far East Dallas. Owens paid for the room. The pair were joined by Diedre . Lyons, a friend of Owens', her cousin and another friend. She said everyone was drinking and taking drugs. Lyons said she left the party about 4am or 5am the next day because she felt sick. The afternoon after the party, about 5pm, a . security guard heard a loud disturbance from Owensâ€™ room on the third floor and saw Richardson run out of the room, naked and covered in blood. He called police, who found Owens dead in the room. It appears that no-one else was in the room. A Dallas County medical examiner's office field agent who examined Owens' body found that he had 'multiple stab wounds to his upper body, his throat was cut and there was traumatic amputation' of genitalia. Murdered: Cedric Owens, 34 (pictured left and right) was found stabbed to death and . castrated in a Dallas motel room in April 2012. Cristal Richardson . claims he raped her before she allegedly stabbed him . Meanwhile, Richardson was taken to hospital with a stab wound on her right thigh, a cut on her forearm and hair stuck in the dried blood on her fingers. Dallas News reported that, during her sexual assault exam, Richardson said he felt like she had been raped, but couldn't recall what happened or identify her attacker. She told the medical examiner, Dr. Evelina Alcalen, who testified in court, that she had consumed vodka, beer, marijuana and medication for schizoaffective disorder. Alcalen said there were no signs of sexual assault injuries, but it's normal for rape victims to be injury- free. Forensic analysts said the pocket knife police allegedly used to stab Owens was mainly covered in Richardson's blood, and a used condom found at the crime scene matched Richardson's and Owens' DNA. Scene: The gruesome attack occurred in a room on the third floor of Motel 6 Dallas Fair Park in Dallas, Texas (pictured) in April 2012 . At the time of the attack, Richardson . told investigators she ate breakfast and took a nap and didn't remember anything else until she was taken away from . the scene. In court Tuesday, Healy showed jurors a video of an interview in which Richardson said she remembered stabbing Owens, but not killing or castrating him. Both Richardson and Owens had criminal records, including felony convictions, according to CBS News. Richardson's record included convictions for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, theft, marijuana possession and drunken driving. Owens' record included convictions for drug possession, family violence assault and evading arrest.","Cristal Richardson allegedly stabbed to death and slit the throat of Cedric Lamont Owens, 34, in a Dallas motel room in 2012 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It takes hours of practice and years of experience to become a piano virtuoso or a concert violinist. But a new app that works alongside a small USB device lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer. Users can move their hands and fingers in mid-air, which the clever little device beneath translates into motion and then a variety of sounds that can be layered up to make tunes. Hands on: A new app that works alongside a small USB device called the Leap Motion Controller (pictured) lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer . The innovation is described by the app’s creators as ‘a new expressive musical instrument’. U.S. based computer sensor manufacturer, Leap Motion, has turned its attention to electronic music by enabling its hands-free controller to work alongside the Mac desktop app called Muse. The app is the result of a collaboration between a musician called BT who composes tunes for films and video games and Dr Richard Boulanger of the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. People can use the Leap Motion Controller, which costs €89 (£74; $79) to make their own ambient music. The technology, which is slightly larger than a cigarette lighter, tracks the points of fingers using three infrared LEDs and two image sensors to follow movement around 200 times more precisely than Microsoft’s original Kinect sensor. Infinite possibilities: The Muse app, which costs $9.99 (£6) enables people to create layers of chords, drums and 'atmospheric sounds' using a strange interface of shapes (pictured) to come up with electronic compositions. It uses the Leap Motion Controller so people can compose by waving their hands in mid air . It can read broad and subtle hand gestures and allows people to control ‘normal’ software using pinch gestures to zoom and swiping motions to navigate websites, for example. The hardware works alongside a conventional mouse and keyboard, which allows would-be-musicians to interact more normally with the computer programme. The Muse app, which costs $9.99 (£6) enables people to create layers of chords, drums and ‘atmospheric sounds’ using a strange interface of cubes, The Next Web explained. By hovering a finger over the cubes they are selected and a simple hand gesture of opening the fingers plays them. The app’s creators said this gives people an ‘infinite sound palette’ from which to combine sounds. No more boring instruments: The app is a result of a collaboration between musician BT and Dr Richard Boulanger of the Berklee College of Music to free people from traditional instruments. Here a screen shows a more conventional view for musicians who want to compose tunes using traditional notes . Swiping side to side accesses extra chord sets and drums, while an ‘AutoMuse’ function means people can listen to – or play long with – music being automatically composed by the software. Echo and reverberation of the sound can be controlled by moving hands in a certain way towards the computer screen, making the virtual instrument much more intuitive to learn than a traditional instrument. BT and Dr Boulanger came up with the idea for the app after seeing the Leap Motion Controller. ‘The idea was to get people away from their instruments so we made a way for people to interface with tones where you’re unbound from your instruments,’ Dr Boulanger said. The app is available from Apple’s Airspace store for Mac OS X 10.7 or later versions.","Muse app is result of a collaboration between musician BT and Dr Richard Boulanger of the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts .

Enviro Bear 2000, released in 2009, pictured, lets players drive a car as a bear and is available for Windows as well as in the form of an Android app, called Enviro Bear 2010 . He continued: 'There are very few social table-top recreation activities available that are cooperative rather than competitive in nature. 'Role-playing gaming is, by design, a cooperative past time, which in and of itself may have significant benefits in the world where everything is becoming competitive at all ages and levels of society.' However, players can also become too involved in the game, and invest too much time emotionally to a character to the detriment of real relationships. This can lead someone to feel isolated, or develop existing negative feelings such as low self-esteem . Role-playing games can additionally become addictive, due to the large amount of time and effort required to play many of the games. As a result, many of the simulators - fantasy, animal, or otherwise - come with advice and guidance for parents.","The game lets players explore a .

"By . Mark Prigg . Mark Zuckerberg recently promised to 'change the way we communicate' when he announced Facebook was buying VR firm Oculus for $2bn. Now it is believed Hollywood could also be at the forefront of the virtual revolution thanks to a radical new 360 degree camera that could allowed movies to be filmed for VR headsets. Experts say the films would put viewers right in the heart of the action, and could be a radical departure form today's entertainment. Scroll down for video . The Jaunt camera will allow Hollywood to create the first VR movies . The Jaunt camera, which can create immersive VR films for the first time . The Jaunt camera system simultaneously records 3D stereoscopic video in all directions and has a unique design that can be flexibly configured for different projects. The firm has also developed a 3D sound-field microphone, allowing it to 'capture the complete visual and auditory experience' Once captured, the camera images and audio are electronically stitched together to create a 360 scene users can look around simply by moving their head. The camera, called Jaunt, uses a series of lenses mounted on a dome to capture images. When stitched together electronically, they can create a scene a user can 'look around' using a VR headset. 'Jaunt cinematic VR allows consumers to step into their entertainment like never before,' the firm boasts. 'It provides a completely immersive, 360-degree 3D video and audio experience for viewers, allowing them to see and hear BMX bikers zoom past them, watch as battles rage all around them or transport them on amazing trips to exotic locations around the world. 'Viewers take complete control, with the ability to look around in any direction. The firm says it hopes to broaden VR beyond games. 'VR as it exists today is mainly about video games,' said Jens Christensen, CEO of Jaunt. 'We want to broaden the VR experience to mainstream entertainment. 'Jaunt has built the technology to put virtual reality in the hands of the best content creators in the world to deliver stunning, reach-out-and-touch-it entertainment experiences using VR goggles. 'Jaunt provides an end-to-end solution for producing cinema-quality experiences that are simply unforgettable,' said Arthur van Hoff, CTO of Jaunt. Jaunt uses its own specially written software to stitch the images together . 'Our cross-platform viewer allows for playback on many devices and provides an accurate, extremely realistic presentation of the visual and sonic content of the scene in all directions. The firm hopes to work with existing Hollywood giants to create the first VR movies, and recently announced $6.8 million in venture funding from top investors, including British Sky Broadcasting. 'Our customers tell us they love having the richest and most immersive TV experience possible, which is why we are so excited about the supporting Jaunt and its ground-breaking video capture technology. 'As an innovative content creator, cinematic VR represents exactly the type of technology we want to better understand and explore.' said Stuart Murphy, Director of Entertainment Channels at Sky. The camera is being reveald just weeks after announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, a California firm founded by 21 year old college dropout Palmer Luckey that is developing leading VR headset. 'Mobile is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,' said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. The future of Facebook? The Oculus Rift headset in action. Facebook today bought the firm for $2bn . MailOnline was able to try Oculus Rift at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year. At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when  attached via straps. However, once our demo started, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. During several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space, with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user's head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. 'It's different from anything I've every experienced in my life,' said Zuckerberg. The firm is among the most advanced in the VR field, and recently began taking orders for the latest version of its $350 developers version. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Zuckerberg. 'Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate. 'The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. 'We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. 'Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. 'But this is just the start. 'After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. 'Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on goggles in your home.' The $2bn deal includes $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Mark Zuckerberg, pictured . Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. Facebook said 'While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.' Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers 'The Matrix - that's always been the dream,' said one Oculus Rift executive of its headset, pictured . The Oculus prototype, pictured, is packed with components - many of which Mark Zuckerberg claims can be found in a mobile phone, making the gadget relatively easy to produce . 'We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,' said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. 'We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. 'It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it's only just the beginning.' Oculus recently raised $75m to make the headset. 'Over the past 16 months, weâ€™ve grown from a startup to a company whose technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR at the time.","Jaunt camera uses several lenses to capture 360 image .

Tucked away behind gates and a 200-yard driveway, the property was commissioned in 1996 by Texan billionaire David Saperstein for his wife Suzanne.

Mrs Saperstein was awarded the estate in the divorce, and put it on the market in 2007 for $125 million. Saperstein, who made his fortune developing the idea of using helicopters to provide up-to-date traffic reports, left Suzanne in 2003 for Hillevi Svensson, the family’s 32-year-old Swedish nanny. The divorce, one of the most expensive in US history, came after Saperstein served his wife with divorce papers as the family’s Gulfstream IV made a stopover in Houston en route from California to Europe. The reason was Texas is thought to be more sympathetic to men than California when it comes to alimony settlements.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It’s taken almost half a century to discover what creature made these tiny fossilised footprints, but researchers are now sure they were made by an ancient spider. The prints were uncovered during the 1960s in Northern Arizona by palaeontologist Raymond Alf. Following years of experiments and studies, experts now claim the prints were made by a 2.5-inch long tarantula-sized arachnid, and date back approximately 260 million years. The footprints, pictured, were uncovered in Arizona in 1968. They are on display at the Raymond M Alf Museum of Paleontology in California and experts believe the tracks date back 260 million years.

The fossils are on display in the Hall of Footprints at the Raymond M Alf Museum of Palaeontology, named after the palaeontologist who made the discovery. Alf discovered the imprints in rock during an expedition to the deserts of Arizona in 1968, which include the Painted Desert and parts of the Mojave Desert. According to the museum, the moisture in the sand preserved the prints and as the sand dried in the sun, these prints became permanent. This sand eventually hardened into rock. After retrieving the fossils, Alf carried out a number of experiments which involved walking spiders and scorpions over inkpads and paper to mimic the shape and size of the prints. These tests were repeated by geologist Christa Sadler in 1993 and both experiments concluded the prints were made by a tarantula-sized spider.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The best ever measurement of how fast the universe is expanding has been made by astronomers. The scientists have discovered that 10.8 billion years ago the universe was expanding by one per cent every 44 million years. The team from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) combined two different methods of using quasars and intergalactic hydrogen gas to measure the rate of expansion of the universe. The universe has been expanding faster in the last 5 billion years thank to a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy, new measurements revealed . They looked at 140,000 distant quasars, luminous regions in the centre of massive galaxies, when the universe was only one-quarter of its present age. The position of the gas clouds are mapped in three dimensions and at different distances the gas blocks showed different coloured light from the luminous quasars. The astronomers then measured how much the universe had expanded since the light passed through each patch of hydrogen. This pioneering technique uses the distribution of hydrogen on the largest possible scale. Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, or CMB for short, is a faint glow of light that fills the universe. Pictured is the microwave radiation from the whole sky, captured by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite . The technique makes use of the clouds of intergalactic hydrogen gas in the universe. This gas can be seen because it absorbs some of the light from distant quasars lying behind the gas. Quasars are the brightest objects in the universe. When the spectrum of a quasar is studied, astronomers see not only the light emitted by the quasar but also what happened to that light during its journey to Earth. When scientists look at a quasar's spectrum, theycan see how the intervening gas had absorbed some of the quasar's light. This pioneering technique uses the distribution of hydrogen on the largest possible scale. 'A little over a year ago we tried this for the first time and demonstrated that it really works,' said Dr Matthew Pieri, from the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth. 'Now we're back with twice as much data and with remarkable precision of two per cent. We are measuring the expansion of the universe with exquisite detail. Like the rings of a tree trunk that tell is its age, each quasar spectrum becomes an archive of the universe's history.' He explained that In the past five billion years the universe had started to rapidly expand due to a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy. Scientists are investigating how and why it is expanding in order to understand the nature of dark energy. He said: 'We are measuring the expansion rate better than at any point since the afterglow of the Big Bang, known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and that precision is giving us a hint that maybe we aren't getting what we expected and so maybe the universe isn't quite as we had thought.' This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, or CMB for short, is a faint glow of light that fills the universe. It hits on Earth from every direction with nearly uniform intensity. Scientists believe it is the residual heat of creation - or the afterglow of the Big Bang. When the universe was much smaller it was much hotter and denser. The ordinary matter that today resides in the form of stars, gas, and dust was packed together at incredible densities and temperatures. In this state, electrons moved freely rather than being attached to individual atomic nuclei. The hot plasma gave off huge amounts of radiation that can be detected as CMB today. The latest study has helped astronomers measure the expansion rate better than at any point since the CMB. Dr Pieri and his colleague Professor Bob Nichol are members of the international Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (Boss) team, which undertook the research as part of SDSS. 'Measuring the expansion rate of the universe over its entire history is key in determining the nature of the dark energy that has dominated the universe during the past six billion years,' said Professor Nichol. 'We measure these enormous structures using both the distribution of gas and the locations of the quasars themselves. This allows us to squeeze everything from the data.' The astronomers believe that by probing the universe when it was only a quarter of its present age, places an important anchor with which to compare more recent expansion measurements as dark energy has taken hold. Dr Pieri said: 'There is an intriguing hint of tension between our measurements and what you'd expect from observations of the CMB. It's odd, but nothing you'd want to hang your hat on just yet - it's going to be fun finding out where the truth lies.' The results are being announced at a conference of the American Physical Society in Savannah, Georgia.","10.8 billion years ago, universe was expanding by 1% every 44m years .

It's over: Transgender teens Arin Andrews and sweetheart Katie Hill, who became world famous after both switching gender, have split up . But the two have decided to split after dating for over a year saying they want to focus on 'having fun' and 'enjoying young adulthood' as singles. As news of the breakup reached their online followers, many took to sites like Facebook to post their unhappiness. 'I seriously hope this info is false,' said Facebook follower Shaun Michael Alfred. Another, Laura Bryan, said: 'Awe, what a shame :'( were so cute and lovely together.' Fabi Niemeyer, another Facebook fan of Arin's, said: 'I'm so sorry for you...Hope this hard time will pass quickly.' Going their separate ways: The two have decided to split saying they want to focus on 'having fun' and 'enjoying young adulthood' as singles . Bond: Katie Hill, who was born Luke, and Arin, formerly Emerald, fell for each other after bonding through their transitions between the sexes . Katie, from Bixby, explained: 'We have a very unique bond because we've been through the same stuff, even though it was in opposite directions. 'But we're at a point in our lives where things are happening and it's harder to spend time together. 'I've started college and Arin will soon, so we don't see as much of each other.' Brunette Katie had full gender reassignment surgery in 2012 costing $35,000 (£20,000). A mystery donor heard she'd been targeted by bullies at school because she was changing gender and actually fronted the huge sum for her procedure. 'It's the best thing that has ever happened to me,' she said. 'I'd felt like a girl trapped in the wrong body since I was born. Journey: Brunette Katie had full gender reassignment surgery in 2012 costing $35,000 (£20,000).  But while Katie is enjoying being one of the girls, Arin (R) still feels he has further to go on his journey to become a man . 'I finally saw what I wanted to see in the mirror and didn't burst into tears any more.' Katie now loves living life as one of the girls and enjoys sessions at the nail salon. 'Getting my nails or my hair done helps me to keep my mind off the breakup so I'm just trying to embrace life,' said Katie. 'I'm pretty much like one of the girls,' she said. 'I get invited to sleepovers, asked to share apartments at university, none of them any of the wiser about it. 'It's amazing and it's not unusual. I've never been one of the boys.' But while Katie is being one of the girls, Arin still feels he has more to do on his journey to become a man. Young: Katie Hill, pictured aged 18, poses for a picture holding a portrait of her when she was a boy . Self portrait: Arin poses for a picture holding a portrait of himself when he was a girl called Emerald . He regularly works out with heavy weights to sculpt his body and give him the masculine shape he craves. Last year in June he moved one step closer to his dream body, having his breasts removed at a clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, after he started testosterone therapy in 2012. However his parents, Mitch and Denise, faced a difficult situation when Katie recently initiated the breakup with Arin. Arin's mum Denise, 43, a business owner, said: 'As soon as they broke up one of the first things that he started hounding me about was his genital surgery. 'There was a part of him that felt that he needed to have full reassignment surgery and finish his transition, because he'd be more attractive to girls like Katie. 'It was a real worry because female-to-male genital surgery is very risky. It's said to be more complicated than male-to-female. Dressing up: Katie dressed up as a girl for the first time openly in front of her family (L) and today (R) 'Also there is a serious danger with all surgery, however small the procedure. We didn't want Arin making a rash decision and his top surgery had made him so much happier, so we wanted him to keep enjoying that. 'We didn't want him to sink into depression like he suffered before he started his transition.' Fortunately Arin reconsidered after the dust started to settle on his split with Katie. He said: 'The breakup did make me think about having the bottom surgery but that was more of an impulsive thing. 'I was emotional and thought I needed to do it, but I realise now it has nothing to do with why Katie and I were separating. 'The real reason is that we are just growing up and we need to focus more on ourselves instead of our relationship.' Working out: Last year in June he moved one step closer to his dream body, having his breasts removed at a clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, after he started testosterone therapy in 2012. He has been regularly working out to hone his body . Though he's deciding not to rush anything, Arin still hopes one day to have full genital surgery. 'It sure would be nice to have and not risk that issue in a relationship,' he added. 'I'd love to be married one day and have my own kids and have a kid that calls me their dad, even though I won't be able to have a conventional pregnancy with my partner.' In a touching move, Arin and Katie have decided to remain firm friends and will continue to support each other. Katie said: 'We think that's what's important is that we've been there for each other through the whole hard parts of it an now we can just focus on having fun and enjoying being who we really are. 'We've been so much we'll be friends for the rest of our lives. We couldn't imagine not being there for each other in some way.'

Born just two days apart, they lived in the same marital home for 70 years and loved to hold hands right up until they died – exactly a week apart. And yesterday, the devoted 93-year-olds were laid to rest side by side at the same church they married in on Christmas Day 1943. In a poignant tribute, their coffins arrived to the sound of wedding bells. This was to make up for the fact that when they married, the vicar refused to ring the bells because they were only to be used to alert residents to Nazi bombing raids.

It’s so lovely to think that they are now together forever.’Indeed, the couple’s lives seemed intertwined almost from the start. Mr Barnsley – who went on to build casings for the bouncing bombs used in the Dambusters raid – was born on April 27, 1920, while his wife arrived two days later. At the age of 23, they married. Although their marriage produced no children, they were close to their cousins and other family members. And despite being together for over seven decades, they kept their romance alive – kissing and hugging – right up until Mr Barnsley died of a heart attack at 9am on March 18. Half an hour later, his wife also suffered a heart attack. She was rushed to hospital but died at 9am on March 25 – seven days to the minute after her husband. Joint funeral: The pair were laid to rest side by side on Wednesday at the same church where they married 70 years earlier . Gone together: Bert died from a heart attack at 9am on March 18. His wife Mary had a heart attack 30 minutes later and was rushed to hospital. She died at 9am on March 25 - exactly one week after the death of her husband . Yesterday, as they awaited the arrival of the coffins, carried by a horse-drawn cart, relatives paid tribute to the couple whose marriage stood the test of time. Keith Arnold, 61, who is married to their niece, said: ‘As they got older they would sit together and they shared a bed right up until the end. ‘They would always hold hands and if they were ever apart they would always greet each other with lots of kisses and hugs – they wouldn’t care who saw.’ Mr Arnold, an assistant manager of children’s homes, added: ‘She was planning his funeral right up until she died. ‘She was concerned about getting his clothes and coffin right. It was a bit spooky in the end with them passing away at exactly the same time a week apart. ‘They really couldn’t live without each other.’ Joint goodbye: The coffins of Bert and Mary Barnsley lie side by side during their funeral . Happily married: Hundreds of friends and family attended the funeral service of the couple who remained affectionate throughout their 70-year-long marriage . Devoted: A newspaper article celebrating Bert and Mary Barnsley's Golden wedding anniversary in 1993 . ‘He made the casings for the “bouncing bomb” made famous by the Dambusters raid. ‘He also worked on D-day landing craft and scout cars – but he wouldn’t tell us anything. It was only years later that we managed to drag anything out of him – and there are some things he still wouldn’t tell us about.’ Mrs Arnold, a retired care assistant, added: ‘During the war he was also an ARP warden and Aunty Mary was a roll thread operator. ‘They were a very close family and it was like open house at their home. Everyone gravitated around them. ‘Their death is like losing your parents all over again.’ Yet despite the family’s loss, there were smiles as well as tears. ‘This is a day of celebration really,’ said Mrs Martin. ‘You don’t get couples like them any more.’ Wedding invite: When the pair tied the knot, the church couldn't ring the bells because they were used to alert residents to a Nazi bombing raid. But the wedding bells were rung in a final tribute as the couple's hearses arrived at the church for their funeral . The Holy Trinity Church pictured in the early 20th Century.

"By . Sarah Bridge . When Bea Marshall found that her three-year old son had cut through the wire of her mobile phone charger, she did not react as most other parents would. Instead of being cross with him and telling him never to do such a thing again, Marshall simply said: 'Wow, you really do want to cut through things!' and give him a bag of other things to chop up. A week after the head of schools inspection body Ofsted said that all young children should be able to understand the word 'no', self-styled parenting expert Marshall went on This Morning to defend what she calls 'Yes Parenting.' Scroll down for video . Bea Marshall says that rather than disciplining her children she lets them do whatever they want . This means that she routinely lets her children Peep, nine, and Jos, seven, set their own bedtimes, decide whether or not they want to do their homework and even swear at her. They can watch television all night if they want to and eat ice-cream for breakfast. 'I was a supernanny type of mother to begin with,' said mother-of-two Marshall. 'There were lots of rules and regulations and I was always saying no. Then for six weeks I didn't say no to them at all and it was just so different.' This was too much for This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby, who is currently pregnant with her third child. 'I dread to think what would happen if I said yes to my children all the time!' she gasped. Bea Marshall and Liz Fraser clashed on the This Morning sofa over whether to always say yes to children . When Marshall's child cut her phone charger wire, she simply went and collected a whole load of things with a similar shape and feel for him to cut through in future. 'But didn't you tell him that he shouldn't ever cut through wires in future?' asked Willougby. 'It's incredibly dangerous.' 'They could die,' added Philip Schofield, looking concerned. 'I don't think I did,' replied Marshall. 'My response is instead to be there all the time for them. I think instead of saying no to children all the time we need to equip them with the knowledge of what boundaries are appropriate.' However parenting expert Liz Fraser said that children needed boundaries. 'It is not unkind to them to say no and can be very useful.' 'If they don't learn discipline and boundaries and the word 'no' at home then it's . going to be very difficult for them at school or in later life. One day someone's going to say no . and they're going to have no idea how to react to that.' Parenting expert and author Liz Fraser argued that children needed boundaries or life could be very difficult . Marshall admitted that she might have been too harsh a parent before and might have now gone too far the other way. 'As a personality I tend not to find the middle ground,' she said. However she claimed that her children were very well-behaved. 'People tell me they are a joy to be around,' she said. But Fraser pointed out that children are too young to set their own boundaries. 'We have a culture of society which is scared about letting children be . children,' she said, 'but statisically children who lack structure and discipline have a much higher likelihood of getting into . problems in life with drink and drugs.' Some viewers took to Twitter afterwards to condemn Marshall's lax attitude to parenting. One person wrote that Yes Parenting was 'just an excuse to be a bad parent and not care' while another said that Yes Parenting meant 'more work for teachers and the police later on'.","Mother-of-two Bea Marshall believes you should never say no to your child .

"By . Sarah Bridge . The family of Anni Dewani cannot move on with their lives or grieve properly until her husband answers questions in South Africa over his alleged part in her murder, they say. Shrien Dewani is flying to South Africa tonight to face trial over the charge of conspiracy to murder after his final appeal against extradition on the grounds that he is not fit to stand trial was turned down. Appearing on ITV's This Morning programme, Anni's brother Anish Hindocha and her cousin Amit Karia described the effect that her murder and the subsequent legal battles has had on their family. Scroll down for video . The family of murdered bride Anni Dewani tell This Morning that her husband Shrien 'has questions to answer' 'You think that time will heal but it doesn't,' said her brother Anish. 'We can't move on with our lives, it's been very difficult at home, we just talk about the case all the time rather than about Anni. We want to get justice for her and we will fight everyday to get it.' He added: 'Sometimes I call my father at four or five in the morning and he's . awake - he can't sleep, I can't sleep, it's all we're thinking about . Our minds are thinking of it every single day. It's like a tumour in our . heads - you just can't get rid of it.' The body of newlywed Anni Dewani, 28, was found on the back seat of a car in Cape Town, South Africa in November 2010 after she and her husband Shrien had taken a drive through a slum district one evening during their honeymoon. Anni Dewani's brother Anish Hindocha, left, and her cousin Amit Karia say they will fight for justice for her . The pair were allegedly held at gunpoint . while in their taxi and Shrien was thrown from the car. His bride was . found murdered the next day in the abandoned taxi with a single gunshot . wound to her neck. South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting Mrs Dewani and jailed for life at the end of 2012. Prosecutors claimed he was hired to carry out the killing and say that Shrien was responsible, a charge he denies. The couple's taxi driver, Zola Tongo, was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Shrien has denied murder and has been compulsorily detained in the UK under the Mental Health Act after being diagnosed as suffering from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. He lost his final battle against extradition last month and is being flown out to South Africa this evening. A medical examination will judge whether or not he is fit to stand trial. Said Anni's cousin Amit: 'It's been three . and a half years and we still haven't got the answers. Her parents . light a candle every single day. They can't move on or grieve unless they have the answers.' Shrien Dewani is finally being sent to South Africa to face charges that he hired hitmen to murder his wife . Xolile Mngeni gives his family a thumbs up after being sentenced to life in prison for Anni Dewani's murder .

Asked about Shrien, who the family haven't seen since Anni's funeral, Anish said: 'There . have been lots of rumours and speculation but we just want a court to answer . them. 'He has a lot of questions that he needs to answer. We want the . trial to get started and then we will hopefully hear what he has to say.'

More than three years after her murder, her husband Shrien is being extradited to South Africa to face trial . The thousands of messages . of support that the family have received since Anni's murder and . throughout the long legal process has really helped, they said.

"The handshake seen 'round the water cooler was no fluke, it turns out. When President Barack Obama approached the podium at Nelson Mandela's memorial service and made a beeline for a row of foreign leaders – stopping first to shake Cuban dictator Raúl Castro's hand – it came after representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months. '[B]ehind the scenes,' two Daily Beast national security reporters wrote on Tuesday, 'U.S. and Cuban officials have held midlevel discussions in Havana and Washington on a range of issues, including direct postal service, migration issues, disaster response, and search and rescue at sea.' During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.' But he acknowledged that 'we’re in talks on issues associated with . migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater . connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Obama shook hands with Castro during the memorial service for former South African President Nelson Mandela, but the 'chance' meeting may indicate a more ordinary diplomatic future . Confirmed: 'We're in talks' with Cuba on a wide range of issues, said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes (L), shown with the president on Air Force One . News that the two leaders' deputies have been meeting in secret comes after nearly five years of a foreign policy thaw between the U.S. and the communist island nation, and nearly two decades after Mandela himself suggested that the two countries re-evaluate their icy Caribbean staring match. The Obama administration has already turned heads by lifting an earlier prohibition on family travel and money transfers to Cuba. But a hostage situation and the iron fist that Castro wields against pro-Democracy activists have largely kept the U.S. at arms' length. National Security Adviser Susan Rice laid out a case for the softer approach on Dec. 4 during a speech during a Washington, D.C. human right summit. 'Ultimately, it will be the Cuban people who drive economic and political reforms,' said Rice. 'And that’s why President Obama has increased the flow of resources and information to ordinary citizens.' The hostage situation involves Alan Gross, who has sat in a Cuban jail for four years. He drew a 15-year sentence 'for facilitating uncensored Internet contact 'between a small religious community on the island and the rest of the world,' as White House Press Secretary Jay Carney put it on Dec. 3. Gross penned a letter to Obama this month, asking for his direct participation in an effort to free him. Some observers hinted on Tuesday that the Obama–Castro handshake may have been an overture toward that end. The Obama administration, meanwhile, faces immediate obstacles to a Cuba rapprochement that go far beyond the imprisonment of one American. Raul Castro was a guerrilla commander under his brother Fidel in the 1950s and then helmed Cuba's armed forces for nearly five decades before becoming president in 2008. After the revolution, he was responsible for overseeing the executions of soldiers who were loyal to the deposed, U.S.-supported president Fulgencio Batista . Cuban-American lawmakers were brutal in their assessment of the South Africa handshake, and threaten to make noise if the White House takes public steps toward relaxing its half-century-long estrangement and trade embargo. 'It is nauseating': Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen slammed Obama for shaking hands with the Cuban strongman . 'When the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant,' Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said Tuesday during a Capitol Hill hearing. Ron DeSantis, another Florida Republican, said in a statement that 'the excitement exhibited in some liberal quarters regarding the embrace of Raul Castro by President Obama ignores the millions of victims of the totalitarian Castro regime.' 'President Obama failed the people of Cuba with this very public handshake,' added Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon. Some criticism came from Democrats, including New Jersey Rep. Albio Sires. 'I'm very disappointed that the president would shake the hand of someone who stands for the opposite of everything Nelson Mandela stood for,"" the Cuban-American congressman told PolitickerNJ. 'Castro stands for the abuse of human rights and lack of freedom. It was just very hypocritical of the president to go and honor Mandela and then turn around and shake hands with Castro.' In July the nation of Panama intercepted a ship traveling from Cuba to North Korea with a cargo of what the vessel's manifest said was sugar. It turned out to be a massive cache of missiles and missile parts intended for one of America's more fearful enemies, in violation of both U.S. and United Nations sanctions. 'It was just very hypocritical of the president to go and honor Mandela and then turn around and shake hands with Castro,' alleged Rep. Albio Sires . And while Obama and Castro shook hands in South Africa on International Human Rights Day, at least 20 human rights protesters were detained in Havana when they gathered for a public demonstration. But when it's practical, the Obama administration has seemed to embrace Cuba's involvement in achieving America's other geopolitical objectives. The whole world is watching: Obama and Castro found themselves under an unprecedented spotlight as the world's attention turned to Mandela's memorial service . When Castro agreed to host peace talks between the Columbian government and a Marxist guerilla group called the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), Obama had good things to say about Cuba's decision to put FARC, which is has supported, in the same room with a government whose drug-interdiction policies are crucial to U.S. efforts along the same lines. Episodes like that, some former government insiders say, have put America on a collision course with a Cuba that's suddenly interested in normalizing relations – an outcome that nearly every nation supported during a recent United Nations General Assembly.. 'The Cubans regularly say to people that they are ready for a different relationship,' Obama administration veteran Dan Restrepo told The Daily Beast. During Obama's first term in the White House, Restrepo managed Latin America policy at the National Security Council. He said in addition to one-on-one midlevel talks, intermediaries have delivered Castro’s messages to the Obama administration – usually U.S. citizens with connections to the Cuban government. Latin American diplomats political leaders, he added, have also been involved with back-channel-communications between Washington and Havana. New America Foundation fellow Steve Clemons added that 'there has been a string of emissaries, both private citizens and Latin American leaders, who have begun to nudge Obama forward on engaging in talks with Cuba and also carrying a message from Castro that he’s willing to talk.' Clemons has what the Daily Beast called 'exceptionally close ties to the Obama . White House.' He also traveled with Vice President Joe Biden when he visited East Asia recently.","U.S. and Cuban officials have held mid-level discussions in Washington and Havana .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Time for ban number 45: John Moir, 47, was convicted of driving whilst disqualified, but escaped jail . One of Britain's worst drivers, whose carelessness behind the wheel almost killed a man, has walked free from court after breaking a driving ban for the 44th time. John Moir, 47, was caught behind the wheel by officers despite his string of previous convictions and bans. But the serial criminal, whose recklessness on the roads left one of his victims in a coma, was given only a suspended sentence for his latest offence. Moir, also a convicted thief, has previously said that nothing will stop him driving while disqualified, enraging safety-campaigners and his victim, who was given life-changing injuries and can no longer work. Simon Jacobs, 46, was run down by Moir in 2010 as he walked home from playing snooker. As Moir sped away, Mr Jacobs was left in the road with a fractured skull and eye sockets and a broken nose. An ear was torn from his head. Doctors told Mr Jacobs's family that he might die of his wounds, and the former electrician can no longer drive and will never work again. In the wake of his accident he warned that the law needed to be tougher for serial offenders like Moir - whom he warned will eventually kill somebody. Mr Jacobs said: 'I was lucky, but next time things could be very different. He has left me with a life sentence - I will never get over my injuries. 'When he ran into me he got 18 months, but only served half. It is an absolute insult. The justice system needs to listen up, they are playing a waiting game - eventually I believe he will kill someone.' Victim: Simon Jacobs, who was run down in 2010, has warned that Moir will kill somebody unless he is jailed . For his latest transgression, Moir was given a 16-week suspended prison sentence at Ipswich Magistrates' Court. He was also ordered to do 240 hours of unpaid work, and he was banned from driving for a 45th time, this time until October 2016. Moir has no racked up more than 220 offences in total, including resisting arrest and 77 counts of theft. Defence lawyers in his latest hearing claimed Moir was 'remorseful' for his crimes, to which he pleaded guilty. But he has previously described his constant flouring of driving bans as 'a game of cat and mouse' with police and has claimed 'going to prison won't stop me'. Magistrates heard how Moir was caught by plain-clothes officers when they tailed Moirâ€™s Vauxhall Astra in March. He repeatedly locked his brakes and almost lost control on . bends as he drove towards Cratfield in Suffolk. The court also heard he hit 50mph in a 30mph zone. Claire . Hullock, defending, said his then girlfriend had been driving, but got . upset after getting lost, at which point Moir decided she could not . continue driving and took over himself. He . jumped into the passenger seat when stopped by the pursuing cops in a . desperate bid to escape justice but was immediately arrested. Miss Hullock said he was 'remorseful' and realised that what he did was 'unacceptable'. He was also warned that if he drives again he will probably be jailed. Road safety campaigners have said harsher laws are needed to crack down on repeat offenders like Moir. A spokesman for the charity Brake said: 'Drivers who flout bans are making a mockery of the justice system. 'We need the government to get tough with serial offenders by giving judges the power to hand out higher sentences for those who are repeatedly caught driving while disqualified.'","John Moir, 47, admitted breaking driving ban at Ipswich Magistrates' Court .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Many women may dream of having legs that go on forever. For Alexandra Robertson, however, it’s no dream – it’s reality. With her astonishing 47in pins, the British model is helping the nation inch ahead in the battle of the long-limbed beauties. Miss Robertson, 20, decided to find out how she measured up after Russian trainee lawyer Anastasia Strashevskaya scooped her nation’s Miss Longest Legs, with a seemingly unbeatable 42in. Impressive: Alexandra Robertson, 20, has legs that measure 47"" - five inches longer than Ms. Strashveskaya . Model: Alexandra was signed up by a local agency after winning Miss Blackpool at the age of 18 . And she was amazed to find  out that hers were a full five inches longer. Miss . Robertson, who stands a statuesque 6ft 1in and is juggling a musical . theatre degree with work as a model, said: ‘It is crazy – I had no idea . my legs were quite that long.’ It is not only her perfect pins that will make her the envy of women everywhere. She is also a 34 DD and wears size 10 dresses. Miss . Robertson, from Blackpool, began her modelling career at 18, when she . entered a competition in her home city. She was spotted by a local . agency and has gone on to model bridal wear and lingerie. She . said: ‘I do get some stares and I suppose I do intimidate men . sometimes, especially in my high heels, but it’s not intentional. I . often hear things like “do you play basketball?” but I just turn around . and reply “no, do you play mini-golf?” and we end up having a laugh.’ Fortunately Miss Robertson’s height doesn’t intimidate her boyfriend of two years, Laurson Moston, 21. At . 6ft, he is only an inch shorter than her. ‘He doesn’t mind  my height . at all,’ she said.  ‘He did ban me from wearing really high heels when . I’m with him, though, because I tower over him then.’ Being tall is something of a family trait. Miss Robertson’s sister Lorna Rycroft, 33, is the same height as her. But . it also has its pitfalls. Miss Robertson said: ‘Getting clothes to fit, . especially fashion clothes, is a bit of a nightmare.’ Karen Jean Cookson, who runs Miss Robertson’s modelling agency Angels Elite, said she ‘has a fabulous personality’. Prize winner: Siberian Anastasia Strashevskaya, 18, has won the title of the longest legs in Russia .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . Exotic dancer: Bunga Bunga party girl Ruby the Heartstealer claims she was not a prostitute . In a tearful protest on the steps of an Italian court, Ruby the Heartstealer claimed she had never been a prostitute. But, the exotic dancer at the centre of the Berlusconi 'bunga bunga' party scandal, doesn’t seem to have everyone convinced. Her one-time comrades have rubbished her claims, labelling her a ‘whore’ who ‘did half of Milan in six months’. Former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi is on trial for sex with Ruby when she was just 17. While the age of consent is 14 in Italy, it is illegal to have sex with a prostitute who is under 18. Both deny sexual contact. Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug, broke her two year silence on Thursday to claim she had never had sex for money. But two of her former associates watching on TV, immediately took to Twitter to castigate her for ‘ruining all our lives’. In an extraordinarily venomous attack, TV showgirl Barbara Guerra labelled Ruby a ‘hypocrite’, who had had more lovers ‘than a porn star’. Miss Guerra tweeted: ‘Fxxx off! She has had more men than there are Picasso paintings. She did half of Milan in six months.’ Another of the bunga bunga girls, Romanian escort Ioana Visan, said: ‘You can’t throw stones and then hide your hands behind your back. She ruined all our lives and that of the president [sic] just to get famous.’ Karima el-Mahroug took the witness stand in the trial of three former Berlusconi aides charged with recruiting her and other women for prostitution . Party girl: Austrian entrepreneur Richard Lugner dancing with Ruby at the traditional Vienna Opera Ball in 2011 . Miss Guerra responded: ‘Why doesn’t she return home to whore herself out. Maybe she’s afraid of being lynched. What a shame. She brought it all on herself.’ Former Italian president Silvio Berlusconi who denies have sex with Bunga Bunga girl Ruby the Heartstealer . In the course of her dramatic statement on Thursday, Ruby claimed that she had been abused by a stranger at church, an experience that prompted her emotional demonstration. The former nightclub performer, who has since the scandal broke in 2011 had a baby daughter, Sofia, one, said she now wanted to clear her name, so her child ‘could be proud of her’. But Miss Guerra ridiculed the remark tweeting: ‘She has become Catholic and went to church at Easter! At least have the respect not to go inside. Go back to Morocco you big whore.’ The two women seemed not to care who was party to their Twitter conversation, at one point retweeting a follower who asked: ‘Do you know that we are all reading all this? ‘ . Both women gave evidence for the defence at the Ruby sex trial in 2011. Miss Visan revealed in court that she herself was paid almost  £2,000 a month by Berlusconi ‘towards her university studies’. Each lived, at the time, in their own luxury apartment owned in Milan, courtesy of the billionaire media magnate. The Ruby sex trial has continued for more than year, subject to interminable delays by Berlusconi’s defence lawyers. The verdict was expected last month but proceedings are currently on hold pending a Supreme Court decision, after Berlusconi’s lawyers demanded the trial be moved to the town of Brescia. His representatives argued that the Milan judges are politically prejudiced against the former premier. The decision is expected as Berlusconi battles to secure a place for his centre right party in a new Italian government .","She denies having sex with ex-Italian president Berluscon .

After seeing his title-chasing side thrashed 5-1 by Liverpool, Wenger took an embarassing tumble on his way back from the city. Strolling through: Wenger arrives at Liverpool Lime Street Station after the defeat . Slipped up: Wenger looks in pain as he takes a tumble coming into the station . Helping hand: A police officer comes over to help Wenger back onto his feet . Back on track: Another police officer helps Wenger with his bag as he is brought back up . The French slipped while carrying suitcases on his way into Liverpool Lime Street Station after the loss. The 64-year-old grimaced in pain and rubbed his behind as two British Transport Police officers helped him up. A club spokesman said: 'He's fine.' Predictably, the fall led to a flurry of activity on Twitter. One user said: 'Wenger knows how to make an exit from Liverpool. When his team slips up so does he. Steady the ship man!' It was just one of those days for Wenger, who saw his side go 4-0 down within 20 minutes at Anfield before conceding another before they pulled one back. On top of their game: Liverpool celebrate their humiliation of title rivals Arsenal on Saturday afternoon . 'What is important is that we respond to that result, especially respond with a different performance because our performance overall was poor,' Wenger said. 'On the concentration level, on pace, on defensive stability, it was very poor and we always looked vulnerable. 'If you concede two early goals from set-pieces then you are in a position where you always have to come out. 'I just think the whole team have failed to turn up with the right performance. We know that you need to be better focused at this kind of level.' Hit the road, Jack: Arsenal midfielder Wilshere can't believe his side's capitulation against their rivals . 'Overall our performance was just not good enough and I include myself in that performance. 'For me it is maybe better I don't talk too much, go home and respond better on Wednesday night. 'Congratulations to Liverpool. They were the best team today and we were very poor - only our fans were good for 90 minutes.' Disappointing: Wenger watches on at Anfield . What's gone wrong? Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny blasted the performance . And it wasn't just the manager who slammed the hapless performance. Goalkeeper . Wojciech Szczesny, who also conceded six at Manchester City in .

"By . John Ashton . and Sean Rayment . Ruling: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe . Britain's most senior policeman has failed in an attempt to use secret court hearings to force journalists and whistleblowers to hand over confidential material. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe used a secret hearing to try to make BSkyB – owners of Sky News – reveal correspondence between one of its reporters and sources within the SAS. The broadcaster successfully appealed against the decision in the High Court but the Met was still determined to overturn the ruling and establish the principle that it could submit secret evidence in closed hearings, and took the case to the Supreme Court. However, The Mail on Sunday understands that the Supreme Court has rejected his demand. Its ruling is due to be published on Wednesday. Requests for ‘production orders’ – in which a judge can order journalists to hand over notebooks, photographs, videos and other material – must currently be made in open court, with media organisations given the opportunity to argue their case. Sir Bernard’s bid to overturn the arrangement was seen by critics as further evidence of the judicial system’s drift towards ‘secret justice’. Despite his failure, a proposed change in the law might yet enable judges to authorise the seizure of journalistic material in closed hearings. Campaigners and lawyers  have warned that the measure – in a little-known clause in the Deregulation Bill that aims to cut red tape – threatens press freedom. Geoffrey Robertson QC said that any procedure enabling the police to obtain evidence in secret removes the ‘safeguard that justice must always be seen to be done’. There is also concern it would deter potential whistleblowers from coming forward to expose wrongdoing. The Met brought the case following the arrest in March 2011 of an SAS soldier accused of leaking sensitive intelligence reports to Sam Kiley, who at the time was the defence correspondent of Sky News. The officer, known only as AB, was with his young son when his car was dramatically intercepted by armed counter-terrorism officers near Hereford. Another SAS officer, a 35-year-old . man working in signals, was arrested on the same day and both men were . accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act. According . to court documents, it was claimed that ‘communications  evidence’ showed Kiley, now Sky’s Middle East correspondent, was receiving . information originating from meetings of the Government’s Cobra . emergency committee, including details of military operations. The Met brought the case following the arrest in March 2011 of an SAS soldier accused of leaking sensitive intelligence reports to Sam Kiley (pictured centre), who at the time was the defence correspondent of Sky News . MI5 officials carried out a covert operation before passing the soldiers’ names to the Met’s SO15 Counter- Terrorism Command. The Met was granted a production order against BSkyB, demanding emails between Kiley and the soldiers and other information. The judge granted the order after receiving evidence from the Met that was not disclosed to  the broadcaster. However, BSkyB successfully appealed against the decision in the High Court. The production order was quashed and the procedure to use secret evidence at a closed hearing was deemed ‘unlawful’. Allegations against the two soldiers were eventually dropped last year. Soldier AB, who was suspended for eight months, resigned from the Army in disgust at the lack of support from senior officers. He is now suing Scotland Yard for wrongful arrest and imprisonment. His lawyer, Simon McKay, remains convinced that the Met presented illegal ‘intercept’ evidence during  the secret hearing. He has complained to Scotland Yard’s Professional Standards Department alleging ‘their officers may have been guilty of unauthorised disclosure of intercepted communications’. In a speech last month, Lord Neuberger, president of the Supreme Court, made clear his concerns about new powers in the 2013 Justice and Security Act that could allow more  cases to be heard in private. He pointed to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court in which judges were ‘able to make some pretty strong statements to discourage advocates from seeking closed material procedures, and to discourage judges from agreeing to adopt such procedures’.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe used secret hearing to try to make BSkyB reveal correspondence between one of its reporters and the SAS .

"By . Mark Duell . A glamorous care worker stole nearly £10,000 to go on a fashion spending spree, a court has heard. Laura Nichols, 26, of Houghton, Pembrokeshire, plundered the bank account of a vulnerable 41-year-old man she was looking after while working as a team leader for a care company. Nichols admitted theft after stealing £9,831.99 over a year-long period from the man’s bank account - and spent the money on her love of fashionable clothes, shoes and handbags. Theft: Laura Nichols, 26, of Houghton, Pembrokeshire, plundered the bank account of a vulnerable 41-year-old man she was looking after while working as a team leader for a care company . Ellie Morgan, prosecuting, told Haverfordwest Magistrates’ Court: ‘Police found clothes, shoes and handbags at her parents’ house. Nichols said she had bought them herself.' However, Miss Morgan added that she 'admitted supplementing her account with the stolen money’. Her victim could not manage his own finances and received 24-hour care at his home in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, the hearing was told on Tuesday. To be sentenced: Nichols admitted theft after stealing £9,831.99 over a year-long period from the man’s bank account - and spent the money on her love of fashionable clothes, shoes and handbags . Hearing: Nichols appeared at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court on Tuesday and will be sentenced next month . Nichols had full control of her victim’s finances because he could not remember his PIN to use a cash machine, the court heard. Large sums of money had been withdrawn across Pembrokeshire and in Cardiff - and withdrawals were made when the victim was visiting his parents in France. Jonathan Webb, defending, said Nichols had a second job at a pub but still found herself in ‘financial difficulties’. She will be sentenced at Swansea Crown Court next month.","Laura Nichols, 26, plundered the bank account of vulnerable man, 41 .

"By . Ruth Styles . With her bulging muscles and intense fitness regime, Georgina McConnell isn't your average teenager. The 19-year-old is a bodybuilder and has swapped mooning over One Direction for six meals a day, five workouts a week and an impressive 10st 3lb physique. And it would appear that the teenager's dedication has paid off, after she took home a gold medal in the UKBFF [UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation] North East Championships this summer. Scroll down for video . Powerful: Georgina McConnell, 19, is determined to make her professional bodybuilding dreams come true . Georgina, of Houghton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear, said: 'I absolutely love bodybuilding - it’s my life. 'My mum and dad are really into keeping fit, so there were always weights and stuff lying around the house when I was younger. 'I was about 17 when I decided I wanted to take up bodybuilding properly, although I was already quite stacked by then. 'I knew it was an unusual thing for a girl my age to want to do - most girls want to be thin and dainty - but I really love it.' The teen, who is a statuesque 5ft 7in tall, revealed that her powerful frame had divided opinions among her friends, family and the opposite sex. 'My parents and friends are really proud of me and think I look great, but my brother is the total opposite - he doesn’t get the whole bodybuilding thing at all,' she said. 'I don’t have a boyfriend at the moment, but I don’t think my unusual hobby will put all boys off. Yes, some are a bit intimidated by my muscles, but others like them - I think  it’s an acquired taste.' Tough: Georgina's routine includes six meals a day and intense workouts five days a week . Bodybuilder: Georgina follows in the footsteps of model-turned-athlete Jodie Marsh, who also competes . But while Georgina is used to showing off her toned physique in a string bikini onstage, she is keen to cover up in everyday life. 'Although bodybuilding has really helped my self-esteem, I tend to cover myself up when I’m out and about,' she said . 'If I don’t, people stare at me - especially at my arms and shoulders. I get a lot of compliments for my physique, but I get a lot of insults too - quite a few people have said nasty things about me in the past.' But Georgina, who trains at professional bodybuilder Anth 'The Freak' Bailes’s Maxxmuscle Gym in Hetton Le Hole, hasn’t let the insults get her down and has upped her regime ahead of the British Championships, which are due to take place in Harrogate in October. 'I was delighted to qualify for the championships, but I am having to be very careful with what I eat,” she added. See Georgia's tips online in full here and more videos on MuscleAppeal . Criticism: Georgina prefers to cover up when out and about as people are sometimes rude about her looks . 'I have the same sort of stuff - rice, turkey and eggs - six times a day and  can’t go out for any nice meals with my family and friends. 'I get hungry every few hours anyway, so it’s not too bad, but it does make living a normal teenage life quite difficult.' The determined athlete, who recently graduated from Sunderland College, said she dreams of becoming a pro bodybuilder with the International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB). 'I really enjoy competing and would love to be a pro one day,' she said. 'I get quite scared before stepping on to the stage, but I’m alright once I’m up there. 'I’ve also made a lot of like-minded friends, like Anth, through bodybuilding, who keep me going and keep me focused. I would quite like to go to university at some point though, so I’ll just have to see what happens.'","Georgina McConnell, 19, is to compete at the British Championships .

"By . Meghan Keneally . The husband of one of the founders of Facebook has launched his latest bid to run for Congress after buying a home in a competitive district in upstate New York. Chris Hughes was Mark Zuckerberg's college roommates when he launched the social network and now Hughes' husband Sean Eldridge is using his new-found connections to upstate New York to try to win a spot in Congress. Speculation has surrounded Eldridge since he and Hughes helped lead the charge for marriage equality in New York, but the campaign became official Sunday night when a Twitter ad announced his bid during the Emmys. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heading into the campaign: Sean Eldridge (right), who is married to Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (left), announced on Sunday night that he is running for Congress in New York's 19th District . Eldridge, 27, is running in New York's 19th district which is the second place where he and his millionaire husband moved while actively pursuing a political career. New York issues: Eldridge, seen here with Senator Chuck Schumer, worked to help the state pass same sex marriage . Critiques of his carpet-bagger approach first came when he and Hughes bought a $5million estate in Garrison, New York, only to spend more time in a different district once it became clear that he would have a tough time winning the Democratic nomination in that area. In 2010, Republicans Nan Hayworth and Chris Gibson were elected to the 18th and 19th Districts respectively. After just one term, Hayworth was ousted by Sean Patrick Maloney, a gay Democrat who parallels Eldridge in his political beliefs making the prospect of fighting against one another less appealing. The New York Times profiled the power couple in July and described how they first bought an 80-acre estate in Garrison- which was in the 18th District and only an hour's drive to their loft in SoHo- and then later bought a property an hour further away in Shokan- in the 19th District. The couple still own all three properties- the $5million estate in Garrison, the $4,9million loft in SoHo and the $2million home in Shokan. In his campaign video, Eldridge touts . the work that he has done with local industries through Hudson River . Ventures which he founded to help fund small businesses. He explains that he was born in Ohio but makes no mention about the various moves throughout the state. 'I love the Hudson Valley, it's where I'm building my home, my family, and my business,' he said in the video. He . also says that part of his motivation for the campaign is that he wants . to 'reduce the interest in money and special interests in politics' but . pointedly omits any mention of his husband. Power players: Eldridge has been making a name for himself in political circles, seen here with New Jersey Senatorial candidate Cory Booker, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who owns the New York Observer . Hughes has an estimated worth of $500million and now runs The New Republic magazine after having bought it last year. The price Hughes paid for the majority stake in the storied media company was not publicly disclosed. The couple have been known to open their purse strings when it comes to things they care about, including their lavish wedding last July. They had the formal ceremony at the home in Garrison, but then held a much bigger reception at Cipriani restaurant in Manhattan. While the Garrison ceremony only included 75 of their closest friends and family members, the Cipriani reception was extended to include 400 of their nearest and dearest including both Senators from New York and media moguls like Arianna Huffington and Hughes' old pal Zuckerberg. Though Eldridge's personal knowledge of the 19th District may be something he is building, he and Hughes have been working within the realms of New York state politics for years at this point. First attempt: The couple first purchased this $5million home in Garrison, New York (pictured), but once it became clear that Eldridge would not win in that district they bought another house further upstate . Sleek: Their latest property- a $2million two-bedroom in Shokan- means that they are residents of New York's 19th District and on Sunday Eldridge announced his candidacy in the Congressional race for that area . He has worked for a same-sex marriage group called Freedom to Marry since 2011 and the couple have raised thousands of dollars for Governor Andrew Cuomo. Now Eldridge is officially trying to unseat Chris Gibson, the Republican congressman who has represented the 19th district since 2010 after being elected during a wave of Tea Party popularity. 'One thing is clear, this race will test the hypothesis of whether Congressional seats can be bought,' Gibson's spokeswoman Stephanie Valle told Politico in a statement. 'This comes as no surprise. He purchased a multimillion dollar home in our district in January, filed to run for Congress in February, and then cleared up his voter registration problems a few months later.  He's been raising money from wealthy friends while at the same time touting an economic plan that boils down to loaning his potential constituents money.'

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Updated: . 05:28 EST, 10 January 2012 . A mother-of-two, who thought it was 'impossible' to lose weight on her own, has told how she lost six stone purely through exercise after, unbeknown to her, her gastric band snapped. Karren Knight, 47, who tipped the scales at 22 stone, had spent years dieting and in a final attempt to conquer her weight problem saved up £3,500 for invasive surgery. Following the operation, in which she had a gastric band fitted around her stomach to restrict her appetite, she took up dancing to distract her mind from binge eating and was delighted as she noticed her body slim down. Karren Knight, 47, who tipped the scales at 22 stone (left) paid for weight loss surgery and shed six stone. But she was shocked to discover that it was all down to exercise, as her gastric band had been broken all along . But during a check-up two years later in 2008, doctors revealed that her gastric band was leaking and had never worked, meaning she’d lost all of the weight herself. Karren, from Widnes, Cheshire, described that she was shocked by the news. 'I thought it was impossible for me to lose weight by myself - I’d . spent years going on diets and nothing worked. 'It was a vicious cycle, that I thought . could only be cured by surgery. 'I was moaning one day to my sister, . Paula, and she suggested I get a hobby to take my mind off food - and I . went along to a zumba class that had just started up down the road. 'The weight soon started to drop off - but I was convinced it was mostly because of the band.' Karren (left), husband David (centre) and sister Paula (right) have all lost weight through zumba dancing . Nurses told Karen that the band, which was . supposed to be full of saline to shrink the stomach, was leaking - . and had never worked properly. She was forced to return . to Belgium, where the operation originally took place, to have corrective surgery. After having the band fixed, she managed to lose a further nine stone. Now 15 stone lighter, Karen has forged a . new career as a zumba instructor, teaching others the Latin dance -inspired fitness program that helped her shed the pounds. She now takes eight hour-long classes a week - as well as teaching a weekend class with her sister. Karren added: 'Zumba is more like a party - it doesn’t feel like exercise. I’ve now lost a total of 15 stone - and I’ve never felt better. 'I had always struggled with my . weight - when I was growing up, my mum cooked huge stodgy meals, and we . were always expected to clear our plates. 'As I got older, and had my children, . it was always an effort to keep the weight off, and I went from being . chubby to being massive. 'I thought surgery was an easy way to . lose weight - but I’ve discovered all it took was a bit of . determination and finding some exercise I enjoyed.' Karen is now encouraging people to get active before resorting to weight loss surgery. Transformation: After having her gastric band fixed, Karren managed to lose a further nine stone . She added: 'I’d advise anyone who is considering . weight loss surgery to really think twice about it. I didn’t realise . how dangerous it could be, and as it turns out, I didn’t really need it . to lose weight. 'I’m so happy now - not only do I . have the body of my dreams, I’m much fitter, happier and healthier, and I . have a great new career too. My confidence is through the roof. 'I just wish I’d realised what I needed to do before I had the surgery.' And after witnessing Karren’s amazing . weight loss, the rest of her family have caught the zumba bug are are training to be instructors. Her . twin sister, Paula, has shed nine stone, her daughter, Tara, 25, . has danced away seven stone, while husband, David, 51, has lost . four inches off his waist. According to the NHS most people with a gastric band fitted will lose half their excess body weight, and the risk of any sort of complication after surgery is around 1 in 10.","Karren Knight opts for £3,500 weight loss operation .

"By . Damien Gayle . A woman who turned down a marriage proposal from a well-to-do suitor was shocked when he handed a bill of more than £115,000 for everything he claims to have spent on her. Single mother Marie Lacombe, 42, from Melbourne, Australia, says she and 65-year-old Bruce Dusting were never romantically involved. But it seems he felt differently about their relationship, claiming she led him on to extract money from him to fund Zumba classes, shopping trips and even cosmetic surgery. Scroll down for video . Messy: Marie Lacombe, left, 42, who was handed a AU$200,000 bill by Bruce Dusting after she turned down his marriage proposal. He says she led him on but she insists that the pair were never more than good friends . A tearful Mr Dusting told Nine Network's A Current Affair: 'This Marie has just destroyed every thought of humanity that I've had for other people.' Ms Lacombe met Mr Dusting four years ago when she began teaching him dance. The pair became good friends, with Mr Dusting taking her for dinner and visiting her home regularly. But things between them turned sour when he asked for her hand in marriage - and she turned him down. Now he has handed her an itemised bill outlining every single penny he ever gave her or spent on her behalf, which amounts to a hefty AU$200,000 (£116,638). Fully itemised: Mr Dusting claims he loaned Ms Lacombe money to pay for things including Zumba classes, shopping trips, dental appointments, tupperware, birthday parties and even a tummy tuck and breast implants . Ms Lacombe said things 'took a turn for the worse' after rejecting the proposal from Mr Dusting . Mr Dusting says the payments - of which he has kept careful records and include things like dental appointments, Tupperware and even birthday parties for her children - were all loans. And he accuses her of playing on his emotions to get more cash out of him. On one occasion, he claims, she asked him to lend her money she needed for emergency surgery. But when he went to visit her in the hospital, he found that she had got breast implants and a tummy tuck. Ms Lacombe tells a different story. She insists that despite one loan of AU$25,000 (£14,580), the rest was given to her out of kindness. She says much of the money he has asked her to return paid for unsolicited gifts, and she flatly denies asking him for the money for her cosmetic surgery. Furthermore, she says that she worked as his office assistant for four years and never received a penny for her time. 'At the end of the day things took a turn for the worse when I said no to getting married to him,' she said. She believes his billing her for the money is his way of getting revenge for the rejection. Broken hearted: Mr Dusting met Ms Lacombe when she was his dance teacher. Now, he says, due to the stress and upset that she has caused him, he can never dance again . Whatever the truth, it is clear that Mr Dusting has been deeply hurt by what's happened. He says that, because of all the stress it's caused, he will never dance again. 'I've probably still got the ability within, physically. Mentally I still have the ability,' he said. 'But, emotionally, it's just not there any more.'","Marie Lacombe says she and Bruce Dusting were only ever good friends .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Like his father and grandfather before him, Kim Jong-Un rules North Korea with such terrifying control that most of his subjects know very little about the world outside of their impoverished nation. But thanks to the digital revolution, his totalitarian regime is now finding it increasingly difficult to hide the temptations of a better life from his brutalised people. Nor can he prevent the world from seeing the stark realities inside the world's most secretive state where people have reportedly been executed simply for watching films and owning a Bible. The erosion of Kim's iron rule at the hands of technological change has now been explored in fascinating detail in a new documentary which has gained access to astonishingly brave undercover film-makers and defectors. Behind the iron curtain: A documentary revealing the brutal realities of life in North Korea features this footage of homeless boy Min, who was abandoned by his mother because she found it too difficult to look after him . Risking his life: The film features secret footage from Japanese journalist Jiro Ishimaru (pictured), who has spent 15 years training undercover cameramen to expose the truth in the secretive regime . Channel 4's Dispatches programme, which airs on Thursday, films with Jiro Ishimaru, a fearless Japanese journalist who spent 15 years training undercover cameramen in North Korea at great risk to their lives. It follows his latest trip to the border with China, where he secretly meets one of his agents whose latest undercover footage that reveals the realities of life for its suffering people. In an indication of the shameful imbalance in the distribution of wealth, homeless children are seen starving in the streets, while the elite in the capital Pyongyang drive the latest Mercedes. Recent reports reveal more than a quarter . of North Korean children under five are stunted by extreme . malnutrition, while rural poverty remains endemic. According to the Independent, one eight-year-old boy called Min is filmed looking unsteady on his feet from hunger as he explains that his mother found it too hard to look after him so 'she told me I have to go.' 'So I left and now I live outside,' he adds. Courageous: Former political prisoner Mr Chung escaped to South Korea and now smuggles radios, USB sticks and DVDs of soap operas and action films in the hope North Koreans will 'start wanting to live differently' Life in his hands: Undercover footage of Mr Chung smuggling DVDs at night on the North Korean border where guards have a shoot-to-kill policy . Learning about the West: Mr Chung says that his biggest hit so far has been the Bond movie Skyfall (above) The documentary also follows Mr Chung, a former inmate of a political prison camp who escaped to the west and now smuggles USB sticks and DVDs of South Korean soap operas and . entertainment shows into the North. He poses as a mushroom farmer to get them across the border, where guards operate a shoot-to-kill policy. Mr Chung says that his biggest hit so far has been the Bond movie Skyfall. He said: 'The more people are exposed . to such media the more likely they are to become disillusioned with the . regime and start wanting to live differently.' One of those was 22-year-old Changyang who realised after defecting that she had been 'fooled' by the regime. Fled: Defector Chanyang, 22, tells how she had been 'fooled' by the North Korean regime . Getting the message across: Open Radio for North Korea broadcasts to the state from Seoul . The charade played out by North Korea is laid bare when one secret film-maker asks to buy goods in Pyongyang's No 1 Department Store only to be told that he can't. 'They're just for show, to impress the foreigners,' says a staff member. Another clip shows an ox and cart walking past a sign saying 'courage towards the future. Let's move forward!' The propaganda is remorseless in north Korea. Many . people wear a red badge with a picture of either a grinning ‘Great . Leader’ – Kim Il-sung who founded the personality cult around which this . repressed nation revolves – or his simpering son Kim Jong-il, the ‘Dear . Leader’ who died in 2011. Every household must also display their images. Propaganda: An ox and cart walks past a sign saying 'courage towards the future. Let's move forward!' Totalitarian: Every North Korean household must display pictures of Kim Jong Un and Kim Il Sung on their walls . And crucially, there are also signs of open dissent. A woman caught running an illegal bus service refuses to bribe a soldier and instead openly screams abuse and chases him off. And there are even mutterings of discontent and disrespect from a mid-ranking official commandeered to build a special railway to the supreme leader's birthplace. 'How much does he know about the military? He shouldn't be there... he's hopeless!' he says. Dictator: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un meets military officers in charge of psychological warfare against South Korea as he praises them for safeguarding the socialist system, according to a state newspaper . Is control loosening? North Koreans are forced to adhere to the Juche ideology - a doctrine which mixes Marxism with the worship of North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung and his descendents . The documentary will air days after a . South Korean newspaper alleged that several large-scale public . executions of around 80 people had taken place in North Korea earlier . this month. In one, woman and children were herded into a sports stadium and forced to watch people being shot dead by machine gun fire. Why . the executions took place is difficult to ascertain, but the paper . speculates that they may have been carried out to quell unrest and stop . capitalist ideology from growing as they took place in areas of recent . economic growth. Some of the . deaths may also have been a punishment for the perceived crimes of . watching South Korean movies, distributing pornography, using . prostitutes and possessing Bibles.

"By . Katy Winter . Quitting Facebook, ditching 'unsuitable' friends and buying a dog have been hailed as the best ways to save an ailing relationship. A poll of 2,000 Britons found it often takes much more than a hug and a kiss to patch up a partnership after a nasty bust-up or rocky patch. The study discovered ditching social media, where the constant gaze of friends and family adds pressure, was among the most important steps. Ditching 'unsuitable friends (left) and getting a dog (right) have been voted key ways to save a romance . Cutting off contact with friends who have the potential to lead us astray was also hailed as crucial, as was buying a dog, which gives couples something in common to look after. Making more time for each other, talking honestly about issues and heading off on a romantic break together are also most likely to mend a relationship, according to the report. ' The study found simply have more quality time together is the most successful way to save a relationship, with more than eight in ten of those who have tried this saying it made things better. Getting off social media sites like Facebook removes the relationship from outside scrutiny and can help save it . Making time for some old-fashioned date nights is also likely to result in a happy ending, with 78 per cent of couples who gave this a go getting over their rough patch. Heading off on a 'make-or-break' holiday together and being more honest and open with each other during important conversations was also hailed a success by more than three quarters of the couples who tried them. 1. We stopped communicating . 2. We took each other for granted . 3. Money worries . 4. We stopped having sex . 5. We never saw each other . 6. Boredom . 7. We grew apart . 8. We stopped any form of affection whatsoever . 9. Infidelity/one person cheating . 10. We should never have got together in the first place . Other things which can help a couple survive a rough patch include ending bad or unhelpful friendships, making more effort to spice things up in the bedroom and finding a new hobby or interest to do together. Counselling sessions, moving house and writing down the reasons you fell in love with your partner in the first place are also on the list. The study also found that no longer communicating is the most common reason for relationships to start falling apart, following by taking each other for granted and having to deal with money worries. A dwindling sex life, being too busy to spend together and simply growing apart are also to blame for a large number of relationship break-downs. It also emerged that Britons think couples should try to make things work for an average of just under 12 months before they finally call it quits on a relationship. But three quarters reckon people give up too easily on relationships nowadays; with another eight in ten believe older generations were more likely to stay together because they believe marriage was for life. Martin Loxley, National Head of . Family Law at Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, said: 'Most relationships will . go through a rocky period at some stage, and it seems the way you deal . with things during that time can be the difference between patching things up or splitting permanently. 'The secret seems to be spending more time together rather than separating your lives even further than they already are. Simple things like making time for each other in busy schedules can also help a relationship in crisis . 'Many . relationships go through a difficult period when day-to-day life gets . in the way or you become too busy or stressed to simply enjoy some . quality time together. 'As a consequence, you can lose the intimacy and closeness that relationships need to survive. 'So . things like going away on holiday together, making more time for date . nights and even just having honest conversations are often all it takes . for couples to get their relationship back on track. He added: 'Couples should think long and hard before giving up on a marriage. It can have long term financial and emotional consequences for both themselves and any children involved. 'There are organisations which can assist couples in saving a relationship but if it has irretrievably broken down, communication is still key to ensuring that the divorce or separation is as smooth as possible. 'Relationship breakdowns don't have to be acrimonious but if they are, it's likely the couple will face a costly legal battle. 'The single family court will be introduced in April this year and under the new scheme all couples are required to attend mediation before issuing proceedings. There are exceptions but most cases will not fall into these exceptions. 'Following the removal of legal aid for most family cases in April 2013, the Government hope this new approach will encourage a 'friendlier' approach with better communication and earlier settlements.'","Cutting contact with friends who lead you astray deemed crucial .

"By . Jonathan Block . The New York bakery world famous for its cronut pastry that was knocked out of business temporarily last week after a health inspection found mouse droppings reopened Tuesday at 8a with a long line of customers waiting outside. But the Dominque Ansel Bakery on Spring Street is fighting hard to restore its reputation — and what it considers unfair criticism due to its success — by introducing a 'Rocky' cronut. A photo posted on Instagram shows the donut inspired by the famous series of movies about boxer Rocky Balboa, who was played by Sylvester Stallone. It shows a cronut with dark chocolate frosting on top and a yellow golden star. The Dominique Ansel Bakery in Manhattan reopened Tuesday and to honor its comeback made a special 'Rocky' cronut just for the occasion . The cronut, which was only available today to mark the reopening, was made 'as a symbol of our dedication and resilience,' according to a bakery news release. The photo also shows a card net to the cronuts with a famous series of lines from the 2006 movie Rocky Balboa, the sixth movie in the 'Rocky' franchise and said by the title character. Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, in a scene from one of the 'Rocky' franchise movies. 'Let me tell you something you already know: The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows....You,me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward,' the card reads in part. Dominique Ansel also said it has taken steps to make sure the 'severe mouse infestation' found last week by the New York City Department of Health will not happen again. 'We are deeply sorry for any disappointment that we may have caused you,' the bakery said in a statement, according to gothamist.com. 'Taking this opportunity, we have completely fortified our facilities with a full reconstruction and re-cementing, taking every issue seriously in an effort to provide an even more pristine environment for our guests. As you know, we cook in completely opened kitchens, so everything we do is in full view.' However, the bakery also said it was facing 'malicious attacks' due to its success. 'Looking forward, our hope is that honest, hard-working businesses should not have to face cruel and sensationalized attacks that are not framed in the proper context,' the statement continued. 'And systems should not be abused to single-out any one business over another. We urge our customers to seek deeper details and answers before jumping to conclusions. 'And regardless of the hits, we will take every chance and criticism as a lesson learned and work harder to rise to the expectations you have of us and that we have of ourselves.' A mouse is seen scurrying on the floor of the Dominique Ansel Bakery in a YouTube video posted last week . Cronut cravers gathered around Domique Ansel Bakery, only to find out they had been shut down by the health department . When the bakery opened at 8a this morning, there was already a huge line of customers, apparently unfazed by the DOH inspection. 'The mice don’t really cause me concern,' Jay Randolph, 41, who began waiting outside the bakery at 6a told the New York Post. 'If you’re in New York City, it’s hard to avoid a mouse popping up now and then. It’s New York. If you can’t handle some mice, your metabolism is not ready for the big city.' 'The mice run this city,' Lester Sykes, 26, also told the paper. 'The only places that say they don’t have them are just the ones where the inspectors haven’t seen them yet.' The health department responded to Dominique Ansel after . a customer posted a video online April 3 showing a mouse scampering . around the bakery floor. Cronuts fans queue for hours to buy the pastry that is half croissant and half donut . YouTube user Cody Pickrodt shot the video at Dominique Ansel, telling Gothamist: 'I . pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me. They didn't . believe it until I showed them the video. Then they had to leave. 'I didn't mention it to employees. It appeared they were all aware of it. 'This . was the tail end of the little guy's adventure. He ran all over the . place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before I got my phone out,' Mr Pickrodt said. After . the video was posted online, workers at the bakery spent seven hours in . a deep clean and a spokesman told MailOnline that not a single mouse was found. But . a health department spokesman had a very different story tell after . shutting the establishment down for a 'severe' pest infestation. 'What . made the infestation severe was that the health inspector found several . hundred mouse droppings,' a DOH spokesman told Gothamist.","Dominique Ansel Bakery created 'Rocky' cronut 'as a symbol of our dedication and resilence'

"By . Tom Gardner . and Hannah Roberts . It is not often you are granted an audience with God's representative on Earth. But it seems actor Steve Coogan, a self-confessed former user of prostitutes and cocaine, was not meeting Pope Francis to ask for his sins to be absolved. Coogan - who was notorious for his tangled love life, penchant for lap-dancers and taste for Class A drugs - had travelled to the Vatican for a meeting with the head of the Catholic Church to promote his latest movie. Scroll down for video . Holy meeting: Steve Coogan introduces Philomena Lee to Pope Francis, left, before a private audience to discuss a campaign to highlight historical forced adoption . The 48-year-old Catholic was joined by Philomena Lee, whose three-year-old son was taken from her and sold by nuns for adoption. Her harrowing story, and her subsequent 50-year search to be reunited with her missing child, has been turned into an Oscar-nominated film co-written, produced and staring Coogan. But while Coogan has spoken of how a man of the cloth once helped him overcome his daemons -  telling the Mail On Sunday in 2009: ‘I went to rehab in America because I was going off the rails a bit. And I did once see a priest, but religion wasn’t discussed in any of the sessions - he was more of a highly qualified psychotherapist’ - it seems the meeting with Pope Francis focused on the content and issues raised by his new film. In 1952, when Philomena Lee became . pregnant as a teenager in Ireland, she was sent to a ‘Mother and Baby . Home’ to be taken care of. When her son was three years old, he was taken away, sold for adoption and sent to America. Although Philomena and her son looked for each other for many years, they were kept apart and were never reunited. Inspired: Philomena Lee, the woman who inspired the Oscar-nominated film 'Philomena', is joined actor and writer Steve Coogan before a press conference in Rome today . Speaking after the audience, Ms Lee said that meeting the Pope has finally brought her ‘release’ after carrying the guilt of having a baby out of wedlock for more than six decades. The Irish woman, said she finally felt ‘forgiveness’ for the mortal sin of becoming an unmarried mother. She said: ‘You were made to feel so bad for having a baby out of wedlock. It was such a sin. But yesterday after all these years I felt such a sense of relief that I had finally been forgiven.’ Party time: Steve Coogan, pictured arriving at the 2014 Critics Circle Film Awards in Mayfair, London . Mrs . Lee said: 'It was such an honour and something I would never have . expected to do in my life. He made me feel so good inside. It was such a . release' Vatican . officials told her that the Pope probably would see the film. The movie . is based on a book by British journalist Martin Sixsmith who helped Mrs . Lee track down her son Anthony in America fifty years after he was taken . from her and sold for adoption. Tragically Anthony had just died. The . film’s lead actor and screenwriter Steve Coogan, who played Sixsmith, . said that the Vatican seemed ready to accept criticism and 'acknowledge . the mistakes of the past'. Back in the 1990s Coogan, who sprang to . fame as the fictional failing media star Alan Partridge, was dumped by . solicitor Anna Cole, the mother of his daughter, after affairs . with three women, including a topless model who later revealed how . Coogan showered the bed with £5,000 in £10 notes and told her: ‘Lie on . them. Go on, lie on them.’ He later explained the embarrassing moment as ‘me being crassly ironic about what you do when you’re famous’. A . brief marriage to society beauty Caroline Hickman ended after just 18 . months in 2004, soon after the comedian was exposed for having a . cocaine-fuelled encounter with two lapdancers. In typical style, Coogan . laughed the incident off, saying: ‘I was appalled and shocked to find . they were lapdancers. I was under the impression they were Latvian . refugees who needed shelter for the night.’ In 2005 he had a now notorious two-week liaison with Courtney Love, the actress, ex-junkie and widow of rock star Kurt Cobain. According . to Love, the pair enjoyed drug-fuelled sex, during which he allegedly . filled their hotel room with sex toys and Viagra and wanted a prostitute . to join them in bed. When the . brief affair ended, Love launched an angry outburst branding Coogan an . inveterate substance-abuser and a ‘sex addict’. Now . older, and hopefully wiser, Coogan has admitted he suffers from an . addictive personality but is determined to bury the drug and sex . scandals of the past  – not just for his own sake, but for the sake of . his daughter. After . turning 40, he said: ‘It’s time to clean up my act. My parents are . acclimatised to reading bad stuff about me, but [my daughter] is only . nine years old.’ '[The . officials who watched the film said that] its values: Philomena’s . forgiveness and serenity in spite of misdemeanours committed aginst her . was in completely in line with values of church and message of Francis, . which is a new message of encouraging forgiveness and acknowledging the . mistakes of the past.' ‘They . didn’t see the criticism as an attack but they saw it as the criticisms . of a friend, as constructive criticism,’ he added. The . screening coincided with a devastating report by the UN into the . Vatican’s response to the child abuse scandals including forced . adoptions in Ireland. But . former nurse Mrs Lee said she had realised that anger would have only . brought her ‘sorrow and sadness’. ‘Anthony will be 62 this year so how . could I go through all of life holding a grudge?’, she explained. ‘At . the beginning ... I was very hurt and very sad. But then I went into . psychiatric nursing, so I saw sorrow and such sadness that comes out of . bitterness and unforgiveness so I gradually sank my hurt into the . background.’ Emotional: Philomena Lee, pictured with daughter Jane Libberton, has said that meeting the Pope had brought her 'release' from the guilt of having a child out of wedlock . Her story . has inspired daughter Jane to form a pressure group . www.thephilomenaproject.org to campaign for the release of adoption . records by the Irish government. Mrs . Lee said after the film many people affected making contact to ask if . she knew their mother. But she explained: ‘ When I was in the centre you . had to lose your identity. I was given the name Marcella. 'We . weren’t allowed to talk about anything that happened in the world. So . we didn’t tell one another our secrets. We were so ashamed of the fact . that we were there having a baby out of wedlock. We didn’t know one . another’s past histories or future histories. The film, based on a book The Lost . Child of Philomena Lee, has received . largely positive reviews, it is not without controversy. Sister . Julie Rose of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Roscrea, County . Tipperary, where Philomena stayed, claimed the film was misleading. Ms Lee, accompanied by her daughter Jane Libberton and Coogan, discussed the Philomena Project with the Pope. The . project is calling on the Irish government to enact legislation to open . up adoption records and reunite mothers separated from their children . as a result of forced adoption. It was set up to harness this increased awareness to the pain and loss which thousands of young women experienced over decades. Among . its objectives, the project is urging for the Irish government to . release all information it has on the illicit adoptions, to assist in . helping mothers and their children to find one another, and to create a . place for these individuals to tell their stories in an effort to find . closure.","Coogan has a sordid past of drug use and flings with lap-dancers .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . An 'audacious' gang dressed in burkas and posed as wealthy Muslim women to steal designer watches worth more than £1.4million from Selfridges, a court heard today. Customers and staff in the world famous department store on London’s Oxford Street were left 'terrified' by the smash and grab raid, the court was told. Some of the all-male gang, armed with axes and other equipment, also allegedly wore burkas to fleece a jewellery store in Windsor two months earlier. Scroll down for video . Smash and grab: An eyewitness films one of the burka-clad robbers fleeing Selfridges . Caught on camera: This cameraphone video shows one of the robbers running for the exit . Escape: The burka-clad raider clutches what appears to be an axe while fleeing the scene . Four men are standing trial over the attempted robbery at Kingston Crown Court, a year after four other men were convicted for their part in the event. Ramela Gordon, 18, Ritchie Graham, 24, Vincent Bellamy, 37 and Leon Wright, . 25, all from North Londoner, deny conspiracy to rob. Gordon and Graham are also accused the £170,000 of watch haul in Windsor. Roger Smart, prosecuting, told Kingston Crown Court that the gang first carried out a 'well-planned robbery' at Robert Gatward jewellers in King Edward Court, Windsor. Mr Smart said: 'The robbers, all of whom were male, wore burkas in order to disguise their identities and the equipment that they had taken with them in order to carry out the robbery. 'They smashed their way into display cabinets whilst staff and customers were inside the premises and bystanders looked on in fear as they carried out their well-executed plan. Response: The court heard how getaway drivers crashed and were apprehended . 'They stole a total of 19 Rolex watches with a value of between £3,000 and £31,650 per item. 'The robbers quickly made off, running through the streets of Windsor, one of them with an axe raised above his head, warding off anyone who may have sought to impede their escape, to a nearby parked getaway car that took them and their property back towards London from where they had first come.' As well as stealing £175,000 of watches, the thieves caused £41,361 worth of damage to the jewellers, meaning it suffered £216,361 worth of loss, the court heard. Mr Smart said that less than two months later the same gang, along with some new faces, 'doubtless buoyed by the success of the robbery in Windsor' targeted Selfridges on Oxford Street in central London on June 6th last year. He said: 'The plot to rob was audacious, well-planned and carried out with the same degree of professional execution as the previous robbery. 'They made their way inside the store and smashed at showcases containing high value watches of a variety of makes. 'Members of the public and staff were terrified by their actions. The robber used the burka to disguise their identities and hide their equipment. Destruction: A man looks at the damage left after an armed robbery at Selfridges on Oxford Street, London . Evidence: A forensic officer photographs the wreckage in Selfridges left after an armed robbery . Broken glass: The scene of a smash and grab robbery in Selfridges on Oxford Street in central London . Guns: Police officers at the scene of a smash and grab robbery in Selfridges on Oxford Street in central London . 'Such was their behaviour and appearance that it crossed the minds of many of those who were forced to witness the robbery that the men dressed in burkas were using them in order to hide their identities while perpetrating a terrorist atrocity.' The gang escaped using two motorbikes, a motor scooter and a BMW car, all of which were stolen.Sam Curtin, who was still wearing his burka, and Connor Groake, a getaway driver, were arrested when their moped crashed at the corner of Goodge Street junction with Charlotte Street and they were seized by passers by, the court heard. Mr Smart said: 'It was the quick thinking and bravery of members of the public that lead to both of them being detained, some of the watches being recovered and aided the police investigation.' The thieves stole 143 watches worth £1,496,280 and damaged others worth £1.1million. Onlookers: A crowd at the scene of a smash and grab robbery in Selfridges on Oxford Street in central London . Mr Smart added: 'The Windsor offence was a carefully planned, sophisticated and targeted robbery. 'The robbers carried out in advance reconnaissance of intended started on April 5 2013, and an aborted attempt on April 11, before the actual robbery on April 12. 'The sophisticated and targeted planning, the use of new tools and the choice of the disguises at the Selfridges robbery show the same preparation as before.' Mr Smart then showed the court the telephone cell site analysis of calls made by Murrain and Gordon during the reconnaissance mission on April 5th, together with data generated by automatic number plate recognition devices. Police on scene: Officers are seen in the iconic London department store . Targeted: The gang of armed robbers targeted Selfridges Department Store on Oxford Street in June 2013 . This showed both men had made a journey to Windsor from north London and back at the same time, while remaining in constant contact. He said: 'It is more than coincidence the telephones moved with the vehicles from the north London area to Windsor and the cells providing best coverage round Richard Gatward were used.' A ninth man, Andre Murrain, is also accused of involvement in both crimes, and will appear in court at a later date. The trial continues.

"By . Ian Drury . Poignant letters and diaries written by soldiers on the frontline will be among the 'treasures' on display after a £23.25million redevelopment of one of Britain's best-loved attractions. Freshly-discovered documents which have lain unseen for centuries will feature in one of the new galleries at the National Army Museum. It will showcase handwritten notes, postcards, photographs and diaries - both endearing and heartbreaking - from troops risking life and limb in conflicts during the 400-year history of the British Army, right up to the present day war in Afghanistan. This board was made from the uniforms of British soldiers and the pieces from bone. It was sewn by soldiers during the Crimean War and is a surprising example of what soldiers do to occupy their time whilst on campaign . Historic military artefacts, uniforms and weapons are also expected to be used to shed fresh light on the life and work of soldiers. The museum in Chelsea, south-west London, is planning five permanent galleries to focus on the British Army, highlighting its multi-cultural history and what it felt like to be a serviceman. A museum spokesman said: 'Soldiers sit at the very heart of the story. The ""Soldier"" gallery will explore the lives of troops as individuals – utterly human, capable of courage and cowardice, virtue and vice. 'It will highlight the career paths of soldiers in a range of Army roles over five centuries, following their journey through enlistment, training, daily life, combat and beyond. 'Using personal testimonies and unique written records from the museum's archives, the gallery will examine the similarities and differences of soldiering through time, right up to the conflict in Afghanistan.' The project will also highlight the contributions of soldiers from across the Commonwealth. The 'Battle' gallery will explore the most challenging test for the Army: armed combat on the frontline.Using examples from the Napoleonic Wars, the Charge of the Light Brigade and the First and Second World Wars, it will look at how warfare has changed over time, including shifts in tactics, technology and equipment. This balancing monkey-on-a-stool toy was carved by Lieutenant Walter White while he was a prisoner-of-war in Valenciennes during the Napoleonic Wars in 1811. The subject matter is certainly not out of place in a modern context and demonstrates hobbies and skills of soldiers that one might not expect . Museum bosses hope to revolutionise the experience for visitors by providing improved exhibition spaces, learning areas for school trips, a research centre and a new cafe and shop. Since opening in Chelsea in 1970 the museum's popularity has grown. It now receives more than 250,000 visitors per year. Work on the redevelopment is hoped to begin later this year. The museum is currently awaiting planning permission and has applied for £11.5million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. William Henry Clinton was the son of Henry Clinton, second in command of the British forces during the American Revolutionary War. These playing cards belonged to the family . Unseen exhibits being considered for the new galleries include a parachute smock belonging to Sergeant Peter Thorpe who was killed in a rocket attack by Taliban militants in July 2006. The 27-year-old, of the Royal Corps of Signals, died when a defensive position at a base in Sangin was struck by enemy fire. He had joined the Army at the age of 16 and trained as a boy soldier at the Army Apprentice College in Harrogate. His smock and story will be included among objects relating to soldiers who have been killed on service dating back to the early years of the Army’s history. The displays will also feature a balancing monkey-on-a-stool wooden toy carved by Lieutenant Walter White whilst he was a prisoner-of-war in Valenciennes during the Napoleonic Wars in 1811. The carving demonstrates hobbies and skills of soldiers to pass the time. Lt White’s experience is made more relevant by letters with his parents in which he requests more money to be sent to him. And a pack of playing cards owned by Major General William Henry Clinton, dating to 1810, illustrates how family traditions have always motivated people to join the Army. William was the son of Henry Clinton, second in command of the British forces during the American Revolutionary War. His brother also served with the Army as did his two sons. The playing cards will be displayed alongside other personal objects relating to the family.","Documents will feature in a new gallery at the National Army Museum .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Indiana woman was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2001 death of her 10-week-old daughter whose remains were found in an Arkansas storage unit. Jurors deliberated about an hour before finding Krissy Lynn Werntz, 34, guilty in the death of her two-month-old daughter, Montana. Her boyfriend, Jason Hann, 38, became angry that their daughter, Montana, was crying. He struck her in the head and killed her. Hann has already been sentenced to death for his role in the baby's killing. Convicted: Krissy Lynn Werntz, 34, has been found guilty in the death of her daughter, Montana, whose decomposed remains were found in an Arkansas storage unit a year after she was killed . Her body was stuffed into a ‘blue Tupperware-type . plastic container’ and moved away. The couple kept it in trailers and motorhomes . for nine months as they moved from state to state living a ‘transient, . gypsy-style life’ doing odd jobs, . Her decomposed remains were found in an Arkansas storage unit in 2002, a year after she was killed. The remains were found after the storage unit’s contents were sold because Werntz and her boyfriend Jason Michael Hann failed to pay the bill. Montana’s remains were kept in a plastic storage container in a trailer in a Arkansas storage unit. But when Hann and Werntz stopped making payments, the trailer was auctioned off in February 2002 to an Arkansas man, who found the baby’s body. Jailed: Krissy Werntz, left and Jason Hann, center, are escorted from a courthouse in Portland, Maine in 2002 after their daughter's decomposing remains were found in a trash bag at an Arkansas storage unit . The person who bought the contents found the child’s body stuffed in a plastic container. The discovery triggered a nationwide search for Werntz and Hann. Hann, who was also the baby's father, was convicted of murder last December for inflicting the fatal injuries and was sentenced to death in February. Werntz sobbed when the verdict was read. She now faces 15 years to life in prison. Werntz chose a 'gypsy lifestyle' with Hannm, Deputy District Attorney Lisa DiMaria told jurors in her closing argument Monday. The couple traveled the country with their child, Jason, yet in July 1999 the infact suffered fatal injuries. Werntz claimed she thought he may have been bitten by a spider. Bizarrely, she didn't call authorities and hid the baby’s remains by keeping them with her. Less than a year later, the couple had a daughters, Montana. Before she was even a month old, her leg was 'snapped in half like a twig,' and her mother Werntz ignored what happened. Montana died in February 2001, and just like last time, Werntz didn’t call for help and concealed the baby from law enforcement. Horrific: Werntz stuffed the body into a blue Tupperware-type plastic container and moved away, keeping it in trailers and motorhomes for nine months as they moved from state to state . 'The only reasonable interpretation is the defendant was part and parcel of all of this,' prosecutor Di Mario said, telling jurors 'the only way that Montana’s suffering ended was when her parents ended her life.' No father figure: Jason Hann, 38, was sentenced to death for his role in murdering his two-month-old daughter, Montana . 'This baby was abused and killed while in the care and custody of the defendant and Hann. Either she co-abused the child, or failed to protect the child,' DiMaria said. 'It was like some twisted, baby-killing Bonnie and Clyde,' she went on. Hann and Werntz were arrested in April 2002 at a motel in Portland, Maine. In February 2006, Hann entered a plea of no contest  in Vermont to the boy’s murder. He was convicted of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 27 to 30 years in prison. Hann was then brought back to Riverside County and tried for Montana’s murder. In that case he was convicted and sentenced to death. The following day, police found their son Jason’s remains in a plastic container in a storage unit in Arizona. Authorities said the couple had trekked around with the boy's body for 18 months. Hann . was serving a 27- to 30-year prison sentence for that death when he was . extradited to California in 2009 to be tried for Montana's death, and . it took four years for the death-penalty case to make its way through . the system and into opening arguments. The couple’s third child, a month-old boy named Michael, who was found to have numerous broken ribs, bleeding under his . skull and other internal injuries when he was found. That boy survived and was later adopted by his foster mother. Werntz faced 15 years to life in prison for her part in Montana’s murder when she is sentenced on June 27. She was never charged in the death of her first baby boy.","Krissy Lynn Werntz, 34, was found guilty on one count of murder related to the death of her daughter .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A bridge collapse that sent cars and drivers plunging into the Skagit River in Washington State was caused by an over-sized truck that collided with the span of structure, authorities have said. 'For reasons unknown at this point in time the semi struck the overhead of the bridge causing the collapse,' State Patrol Chief John Batiste revealed at an overnight news conference. The truck made it off the bridge and the driver remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators, he added. Three passengers were pulled alive from their vehicles after they plunged tens of feet into the water below at around 7pm on Thursday. Even more were pulled from the debris, but rescuers said no one died in the dramatic accident and all victims have been accounted for. Scroll down for video . Rush hour: The bridge over the Skagit River collapsed shortly before 7pm on Thursday causing a number of passenger-filled cars to fall into the water below . Revelations: The bridge was reportedly listed as one of the state's structurally deficient bridges . Rescue effort: Workers form a human chain as they begin to remove a woman from a vehicle in the water . Lucky escape: A man is seen sitting atop a car that fell into the Skagit River after the bridge collapse . As the rescue operation remains . underway, it was revealed that the bridge was previously recognized by . state authorities as being 'functionally obsolete' as a result of . certain structural changes that required attention. The I-5 runs through the state, . crossing the Skagit River at a number of different points, but the . bridge where the collapse happened was between Burlington and Mount . Vernon. Both the north and southbound lanes . of the bridge fell into the water, and as such both directions of the . highway have been closed in the area. There . were early eyewitness reports that people watching were screaming that a . man was stuck inside his truck that fell in the water during the . collapse. Damage: The first pictures of the scene show that both the north and southbound lanes of the Interstate highway collapsed on Thursday evening just before 7pm . Rescue: Three people were initially pulled from the water alive, though there remained concerns about other possible passengers who were trapped by debris . Collapse: The section of the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River is seen in an aerial view . Jeremiah Thomas, a volunteer firefighter, said he was driving in the area when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. 'The bridge just went down, it crashed through the water,' he said. 'It was really surreal.' At least two vehicles - a car and the pickup with a trailer attached - fell into the river, officials said. Vehicles in the water, which is about 15 ft deep at the point of the incident, could be seen bobbing on the surface and were likely resting on collapsed portions of the bridge. Dan Sligh and his wife were in their . pickup truck on Interstate 5 heading to a camping trip when a bridge . before them disappeared in a 'big puff of dust', he said. 'I hit the brakes and we went off,' Sligh said from hospital, adding he 'saw the water approaching ... you . hold on as tight as you can.' Desperate search: Eyewitnesses said that they could hear a man screaming from one of the trucks that fell in the water . Troubled water: Both the north and south bound lanes of the interstate were effected so much of the nearby highway was closed in order to prevent any other accidents . Scary: Though the water was not particularly deep where the collapse occurred, there were a number of other factors that could prove threatening for the passengers inside the cars, like this overturned one . Questions: There are unconfirmed reports that a large truck hit something to unsteady the bridge but investigators are still looking into what caused the unexpected collapse . Sligh, who was dumped into the chilly . waters with his wife and another man in a different vehicle, dislocated . his shoulder in the plunge. He managed to pop it back in to place . before calling out to his wife, who he described as being in shock. The three victims were taken to . Skagit Valley Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The other man . was reported in stable condition at United General Hospital in . Sedro-Woolley, hospital CEO Greg Reed said. Officials were quick to note that it . would not be a massive accident, as highway trooper Mark Francis told . local station King 5 News that because the bridge is in a relatively . rural area, he does not expect mass casualties. The bridge, which was built in 1955, was inspected twice last year and repairs were made, Transportation Secretary Lynn Peterson said. 'It's an older bridge that needs a lot of work just like a good number of bridges around the state,' she said. Hopeful: Crowds gathered on the river bank as the rescue crews bring survivors out of the water . Viewing the scene: Crowds gathered on the top of the bridge as they tried to assess the damage . Location: The bridge itself is in a rather remote area between the towns of Burlington and Mount Vernon but the interstate itself is a major thoroughfare that connects Seattle to Canada . Officials are now working on plans for either a temporary or permanent replacement, she said. According to a blog that monitors . transportation reports, the 2010 inspection called for an estimated . $1,035,000 in repairs to bring the bridge and its connection to the . surrounding riverbank up to satisfactory levels. The bridge was not classified as structurally deficient, but the Federal Highway Administration listed it as being 'functionally obsolete' - meaning the design is outdated, such as having low clearance. The bridge has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100, according to federal records, which is well below the statewide average rating of 80, according to an Associated Press analysis.","A portion of a major interstate highway collapsed on Thursday night .

"By . Meghan Keneally . It has been revealed that the elderly woman whose nursing home ordered in a stripper had also arranged a trip to Hooters for their male residents. The drama over the decision by supervisors at a Long Island nursing home to allow a male stripper to put on a show came after they reportedly took a host of the male residents to a local Hooters. No further details about the Hooters trip have been revealed but TMZ alleges that it prompted some resentment from the female residents, which led to the September 2012 show. Risky business: The son of Bernice Youngblood (seen putting money in a stripper's underwear) was shocked when he arrived at her nursing home in Long Island to find this picture from a September 2012 strip show . A lawyer for the nursing home said that a 16-member resident committee had requested the September 2012 performance and the nursing home paid the $250 fee. TMZ claims that a now-dead female member of the committee was the one to push the stripper proposal through their voting process. Lawyer Howard Fensterman said that in spite of the lawsuit's claims that the strip tease defiled Bernice Youngblood, the 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient pictured tucking dollar bills in the stripper's underwear, she was not the only one enjoying the plaintiff in the lawsuit, was not the only one who was happy about the event. 'They welcomed it, and it looks like they had a good time,' the nursing home's attorney told The New York Post. Terrible and ashamed: Mrs. Youngblood (pictured) attended a dual press conference Tuesday in front of the facility and she said she felt 'terrible' and 'ashamed' Claim: The lawsuit filed against East Neck Nursing Home (pictured) said that Mrs Youngblood has been 'defiled' by the striptease incident . The salacious event came to light when one of Mrs Youngblood's sons found a picture of her with the stripper among her belongings. The family complained not only about the striptease show, but about the fact that Mrs Youngblood's money was supposed to be locked safely away. They held a press conference outside the home Tuesday, which the woman's son Franklin Youngblood attended. He said he immediately went to a nursing supervisor for an explanation after finding the photo. The lawsuit claims the nurse attempted to snatch the photo from him. Outraged: The Youngblood family listen during the Tuesday press conference. Bernice's son Franklin Youngblood (center) says a nursing home employee tried snatching the photo when he first found it in January 2013 . Attorney John Ray, representing the Youngbloods points to the photograph with his cane during the news conference. Ray says the elderly woman's money was supposed to be under lock and key . The suit said: ‘Plaintiff Bernice Youngblood was placed in apprehension of imminent, offensive, physical harm, as she was confused and bewildered as to why a muscular, almost nude man, was approaching her and placing his body and limbs, over [her] and directing [her] to place her hands about and upon his body, including his genital area, without [her] consent.' It continued: ‘Hiring male strippers to perform for the defendant’s nursing-home patients was a serial occurrence. ‘Bernice Youngblood has lived 85 years as a traditional Baptist, hard-working, lady... And now she has been defiled.' Fensterman said the East Neck Nursing Center's management reserves the right to reject a request by the residents' committee, particularly if the activity were deemed detrimental. 'But in this instance these are adults who wanted to have this activity, they requested it, they voted on it and the nursing home approved of it,' he said.","East Neck Nursing Center is being sued for 'defiling' one of its residents but their lawyer says a group of residents voted to hire the stripper .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A horse trader has been charged with animal cruelty after 49 dead horses, some still wearing halters, were found on his Kentucky farm. Animal control officers were also forced to remove another 14 emaciated horses found wasting away on Larry Browning's mud and manure-covered property. Authorities say Browning didn't have enough hay to feed the 81 horses on his farm, before charging him with 14 counts of animal cruelty in the second degree on Monday. He has also been cited with 49 counts of not disposing of an animal carcass within 48 hours. 'In nine years, this is the worst case of animal cruelty I've seen,' Pendleton County's equine investigator told Cincinnati.com. Charged: Horse trader Larry Browning (pictured) has been charged with animal cruelty after 49 dead and 14 emaciated horses were found on his Kentucky farm .

Starving: Animal control officers said Browning didn't provide enough hay for his 81 horses, which could explain why 49 died . Browning, who claims he has been in the horse business for 50 years, admitted some of the horses on his Butler property looked sick and malnourished. However he said he had so many sick horses because people abandoned them on his land in the middle of the night. 'In . the last two years, I've probably had close to 100 horses dropped off.

Scene: Authorities were reportedly called to Larry Browning's farm (pictured) after receiving an anonymous tip about 1.15pm Monday of a dead horse in a field . While Browning describes himself as a 'horse trader', industry observers call him a 'kill buyer' - someone who sells old and infirm horses to slaughterhouses for a profit. Pracht said slaughterhouses are not allowed in the US, so 'traders' such as Browning truck the horses to Canada or Mexico. However Pracht said, during his investigation last month, Browning failed to provide paperwork showing prices or transactions for each of those international trips. The U.S. Department . of Agriculture requires that livestock be officially . identified and have a certificate indicating that a veterinarian has . examined the animal and determined it is disease free. 'I don't think the general public . understands about where they are selling their horses - people like Mr. Browning and the condition these horses end up in,' Pracht told Cincinnati.com.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Convicted: James Carroll Butler (pictured) spent time in jail for pouring his urine into a co-worker's personal coffee pot in 2009 . A former waste plant employee who poured his own urine into a co-worker's coffee pot has been ordered to pay him $5,001 in damages. James Carroll Butler, 53, admitted to urinating into a toilet, scooping out the liquid with a soda can and pouring it into Michael Utz's personal coffee pot in March 2009 because of 'personal ill will and spite toward him'. Following a brief stint in jail, Butler was Monday ordered to pay Utz $1 in compensatory damages and $5,000 in punitive damages for the bizarre crime. According to The Daily Progress, the men had worked together at the Town of Culpeper waste water plant in Virginia when Butler tainted Utz's drink. On March 16, 2009, Utz went to make a cup of coffee and 'was hit . with a strong smell of urine, observing fluid already inside his coffee . pot that he had not put in there'. He told his supervisor Eugene Ronnie Brown, who suggested testing the liquid, according to court documents. Lab . results revealed that the coffee pot contained urine and fecal . material. At a mandatory staff meeting that day, no-one admitted to contaminating the coffee. But the next day, . Butler told Brown he spiked the coffee. He also confessed to Daniel Boring, the interim director of . the town’s environmental services. 'I . done something I am very much ashamed of to a co-worker for [reasons, . which are] stress-related [and] things going on in my life on and off . the job,' Butler wrote in a brief letter dated March 20, 2009. 'I am very much ashamed of my stupid and childlike behavior.' Close call: Michael Utz (pictured left and right) 'was hit with a strong smell of urine' when he made a cup of coffee in 2009 . Butler, who had worked at the plant for 17 years before the incident, deliberately targeted Utz. Utz had worked as a plant mechanic for the town’s environmental services department since . 2002. Court records show Butler admitted to Culpeper Town Police Lt. Andrew Terrill that 'he was . hoping Utz was the person who would get the urine-tainted coffee'. In May 2009, a general district court . judge found Butler guilty of criminal misdemeanor assault and sentenced him to a year in jail, before suspending 11 months. Butler was also ordered to serve one year of unsupervised probation and . pay $96 in court costs. Utz also sued Butler, claiming the urine-laced coffee pot caused him severe . emotional distress. He asked the court to award him $728,000 in civil damages. On Monday, he was awarded just $5,001, with a jury determining that Butler 'committed battery upon Michael Utz or put him in reasonable fear of receiving bodily harm'. Utz's attorney Michael Sharman told The Daily Progress his client was 'really, really happy about the victory and he’s glad it’s done'.

"By . Sam Webb . and Vincent Graff . Britain's first cloned dog was created by a firm headed by a disgraced South Korean Scientist who falsely claimed to have successfully cloned a human embryo and produced stem cells from it. A 12-year-old dachshund called Winnie has become the first dog in Britain to be cloned, after owner Rebecca Smith won a contest held by a South Korean company - Sooam Biotech Research Foundation - with the purpose of publicising its cloning technique. Sooam’s technology allowed a ‘mini-Winnie’ to be spawned, genetically identical to the original, but pupped by an unrelated animal. The cloned puppy was born thanks to Sooam, a firm headed by Hwang Woo-suk (right). In 2010 a South Korean court sentenced him to 18 months in prison for embezzling research funds and illegally buying human eggs . But Sooam's Dr Hwang Woo-suk is currently serving a suspended prison term on criminal charges related to faked research. In 2010 a South Korean court sentenced Hwang to 18 months in prison for embezzling research funds and illegally buying human eggs. But the court suspended the penalty. The Supreme Court made that ruling final in February. He will stay free unless he breaks laws in the next two years. Hwang scandalised the international . scientific community in 2005 when his breakthrough human cloning . research involving embryonic stem cells was found to have been faked. Hwang later admitted the data was faked but claimed he had been deceived . by a fellow researcher. A piece of skin was taken from Winnie and transported to Seoul and a cell from that skin sample was placed inside a hollowed-out egg and electricity was used to spark fertilisation. Then the embryo was implanted inside a mongrel dog that acted as a surrogate womb. The cloned puppy was born via Caesarean on March 30, weighing just over 1lb. It must spend the first six months of its life in quarantine before it can begin living with Rebecca. In 2006, Dr Hwang was fired from his professorship at Seoul National University and in May that year was charged with fraud and embezzlement. Hwang and his former colleagues created the world's first cloned dog, Snuppy, in 2005, and that achievement was independently confirmed. After being stripped of the rights to conduct stem cell research due to the scandal, Hwang has been focusing on cloning dogs, coyotes and other animals, offering the £60,000 procedure as part of a competition. Viewers of Channel 4’s documentary The £60,000 Puppy last night saw Rebecca, 30, and her family close to tears as they described how the original  Winnie’s affectionate personality and doggy optimism had helped them through a nightmare of mental illness. ‘Without Winnie I don’t know where you’d be,’ Rebecca’s mother told her earnestly. ‘Winnie has saved you.’ The dachshund was an 18th birthday present for Rebecca, at a time when she was ‘having lots of demons’. The pet helped her overcome the eating disorder she had struggled with for years. Now, with their beloved Winnie elderly and arthritic, the Smiths faced a sorrowful  parting that confronts all dog-lovers. ‘She’s very special, but she’s not going to be around for ever,’ said Rebecca, a caterer in London. The dachshund is the first dog in Britain to be cloned, having been imported from South Korea . Hwang Woo-Suk (centre) leaves after his trial at the Seoul High Court in Seoul in December 2010 . Rebecca cannot bear to imagine a life without her canine friend. ‘When Winnie dies, I’ll have to move, because every time I go for a walk I’ll think of her, and I honestly won’t be able to cope,’ she said. ‘I just love her so much, I really do.’ Millions will understand — but many would recoil from the concept of manufacturing a genetic copy. For one thing, there is the cost. Sooam Biotech justifies the colossal price-tag by pointing to the multi-millions spent on developing the technology. Experts emphasise the fact that cloning cannot revive a dead pet. The new animal might look identical, but it will have different experiences, perhaps even a different personality. The Kennel Club said it was  ‘genuinely shocked’ by Sooam’s contest, and added that there is little guarantee ‘mini Winnie’ will resemble her namesake in anything but looks. Original dachshund Winnie, who was cloned, was originally a present for Rebecca Smith, who suffered from bulimia . Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, an expert in genetics at the National Institute For Medical Research in London, said: ‘I see no valid justification for cloning pets. ‘It is a ridiculous waste of money and hope as well as being ethically very dubious.’ The technology that makes cloning possible first hit the headlines almost 20 years ago. Dolly the sheep was created by scientists at Edinburgh University in 1996, but was plagued by health problems and put down at the relatively young age of six. The biologist who cloned Dolly, Sir Ian Wilmut, said he did not believe cloned animals automatically inherited the character of the original — the essence that had made them so loved in the first place — and warned that owners could be disappointed. Rebecca chose to clone her dog because of the irreplaceable bond she had to the original hound who saw her through so much of her life . The only thing that Ms Smith is unsure about is the temperament and personality of her dog-clone, and she'll have to wait for her pup to grow up to be able to tell . One of the British creators of Dolly the sheep (pictured), who became the world's first cloned mammal in 1996, has said he was sceptical of the benefits of cloning dogs .","Rebecca Smith won a South Korean contest to clone her dog .

'I . understand there has been some controversy about my participation in a . documentary called THE PRINCIPLE. 'Let me assure everyone that I . completely agree with the eminent physicist Lawrence Krauss, who was . himself misrepresented in the film, and who has written a succinct . rebuttal in SLATE.'

Mulgrew became an icon of exploration to Trekkies for her role as the Captain on Star Trek: Voyager . 'Everything we think we know about our . universe is wrong,' Mulgrew's voice says over cosmic images in the . trailer for 'The Principle.' The film, set for release this spring, . was partially backed by a well known far-right . conservative, Robert Sungenis, who runs a blog called 'Galileo Was Wrong' and has been accused of anti-semitism. Scientists . such as Michio Kaku, Lawrence Krauss, and Max Tegmart all appear in the . trailer, discussing the Earth's unique characteristics that allow it to . sustain life. Sungenis himself appears in the trailer to offer some of his conspiracy theory. 'You . can go on some websites of NASA to see that they've started to take . down stuff that might hint to a geocentric universe,' he tells the . audience. One of the . physicists involved, Lawrence Krauss, has already come forward to say he . has no idea how he ended up in this 'stupid' film. Opposed: Kate Mulgrew has issued a statement about her work as a narrator in the geocentrist documentary The Principle, and not only does she not believe its insane main tenet, she's upset she was tricked into working on it at all. In his Slate article, . titled 'I Have No Idea How I Ended Up In That Stupid Geocentrism .

Craig Smith, 52, of Blackpool, Lancashire, showered grandmother-of-three Sylvia Scott with gifts to earn her trust before stealing thousands of pounds worth of jewellery. He was caught after going to a pawnbroker with Mrs Scott’s engagement ring, bought by her late husband, along with other sentimental items. Now, Mrs Scott’s daughter Rosemary Finlan has criticised the care system for allowing Smith to prey on her vulnerable mother. She said: ‘Mum had had a series of falls and she needed extra help with making meals, chores and washing. Smith was a very plausible man and she welcomed him into her home. But he groomed her. ‘He gave her a lot of attention and built up a relationship with her. She was always asking for Craig. He was extra nice to her and went beyond the call of duty, so alarm bells started ringing.’ Smith was first employed as Mrs Scott’s carer in July 2012 and regularly visited her home in Lancaster. Mrs Finlan said he regularly bought her mother gifts to earn her trust, including a fan he had purchased while on holiday in Spain and a pair of slippers. Mrs Finlan and her brother Philip first noticed something was wrong when large sums of money disappeared from her bank account without explanation. Employer: Smith, who worked for Elite Care Providers (pictured) of Preston, was arrested in November 2012 . Sentencing: Smith was jailed for six months at Preston Crown Court (pictured) in Lancashire . ‘It all happened so quickly,’ Mrs Finlan said. ‘We noticed petty cash going missing from her house and silly things, like washing powder. ‘The chores weren’t being done and Smith was taking her out without us knowing. He’d call round unexpectedly. ‘Then we noticed that her engagement ring which she wore all the time had gone missing. We thought she had forgetfully misplaced it.’ Smith had gone upstairs into Mrs Scott’s bedroom and rifled through her possessions. He took the ring, bought for Mrs Scott by her late husband Alan, and other jewellery which belonged to her mother. Then he sold it at a Lancaster pawnbroker after telling them it was his grandmother’s jewellery. Smith, who worked for Elite Care Providers of Preston, was arrested in November 2012 and the jewellery was retrieved. Mrs Finlan said: 'We made complaints and nobody took responsibility. Nobody helped us in any way or helped us find another care provider. The whole care system is shocking. Home: Smith, who lived on this road in Blackpool, admitted two counts of theft and three of false representation . ‘My mum is such a nice person. She’s not really aware of all of this because her dementia is quite bad now. You hear about these things in the news. You never think it will happen to you.’ Smith admitted two counts of theft and three of false representation. He was jailed for six months at Preston Crown Court. Charges relating to thefts of cash from Mrs Scott were dropped. 'We noticed petty cash going missing from her house and silly things, like washing powder. The chores weren’t being done and Smith was taking her out without us knowing. He’d call round unexpectedly' Rosemary Finlan, daughter of victim Sylvia Scott . A Lancashire County Council spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We are unable to comment on individual cases. However, all care agencies on our 'preferred providers' scheme are required to meet specific quality standards. ‘We monitor these agencies closely and always take action whenever the required standards are not being met. All care agencies must have a complaints policy, and we expect them to work positively with service users to resolve complaints directly. ‘If the complaints are unresolved, people whose services are arranged by the county council can use our complaints procedure. We take complaints very seriously and work closely with care agencies, service users and their families to resolve any difficulties that may arise.’ Nobody from Elite Care Providers was available for comment when contacted by MailOnline today, or on the three occasions they were approached by a local newspaper.","Craig Smith showered grandmother-of-three Sylvia Scott, 85, with gifts .

"By . Dan Bloom . Mechanics are given some nutty jobs, but this one beats them all. Three grey squirrels had to be dragged kicking and squealing from a crumbling Ford wheel arch after they turned it into their nest. A video shows a bemused worker at a garage in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, extracting the snarling rodents one by one and hurling them into a box. Scroll down for video . Driving out the wildlife: A Ford mechanic in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, had a nuttier job than usual when he was called on to extract three squealing squirrels from a Ford's wheel arch. Here he begins looking for the animals . King Of The Road(ents)! He extracts the first squirrel, saying: 'When they growl like that they're p****d' The new car was at Yocum Ford when the animals decided to make their home inside the snug, warm wheel arch. So the diesel technician, who posted the video on LiveLeak yesterday, had to extract them from the wheel arch before he could sell the car. They had chewed apart part of the fabric of the car and the arch was full of dead leaves by the time they were evicted. Staff gathered round and held out a box for the startled animals to call their new home as the technician said wisely: 'When they growl like that they're p****d.' The tale had a happy ending as all the squirrels survived intact. But there is a surprise at the end of the video - where the technician gets a huge shock while looking for their mother. Tail with a happy ending: All three of the squirrels survived intact, despite making their nest in an unusual place . Grey squirrels often gnaw their way through gutters to raise their litters in roofs, where they chew through insulation and electrical wires to cause a headache for their new neighbours. The use of cars is a bit less common - but when the animals are taken away from the countryside, where they nest in trees, there are sometimes few options. It is not the first time animals have infiltrated human transport. Last week an entire train had to be evacuated in Switzerland after a snake made its way on board during the rush hour. All 450 passengers on the Wednesday morning service from Bern to Basel in Switzerland had to leave after a 19.5in snake was spotted in one of the carriages. Police were called, but thankfully the black garter snake was not venomous. Last summer, meanwhile, a three-week . old kitten survived a 1,000-mile journey across two U.S. states - inside . the engine of a car. The cat was only discovered after the driver heard it meowing en route from Oregon to California. An animal rescue charity eventually freed the kitten after up to three days by sedating it with a 'jab stick' and wiggling it out of the engine while wearing latex gloves. It had an infected eye but was expected to make a full recovery.","Grey squirrels were extracted by a mechanic in Lansdale, Pennsylvania .

"By . James  Nye . A little Florida pig born without the use of his hind legs was given a second chance at life with a specially-made wheelchair and is now to star in his own television documentary. Chris P. Bacon, who has over 100,000 fans on Facebook, has been subject to his own children's book and is set to appear in a PBS show, 'My Bionic Pet' on Wednesday night. His story began when veterinarian Len Lucero adopted the pig when a woman brought Chris to his clinic, wanting to euthanize the one-pound sickly animal. Scroll Down for Video . Television star: Chris P. Bacon, owned by veterinarian Dr. Len Lucero is now set to feature in a documentary that will chart his progress with his wheelchair as he learns how to adapt to life without hind legs . But one look at Chris melted his heart at his Clermont surgery. 'I told her if she surrendered the pig to me, I would try to give it the best life possible,' Lucero said. Lucero built a tiny rear-end wheelchair out of K'Nex blocks, a children's building toy similar to Legos. A video posted on YouTube — showing Chris P. Bacon scooting around in his wheeled contraption — went viral. To date Chris has appeared on the Today show and Anderson Cooper's daytime talk show. 'He's healthy and happy and that's all you can ask for,' Lucero said to The Ocala Star-Banner. 'I guess I did my job. Beyond that, he inspires me, and as I keep seeing over and over again, he inspires many others as well. 'I hope and really think Chris is inspiring a lot of people but, if nothing else, every person who meets him ends up with a huge smile on their face.' Facebook hero: Chris P. Bacon an adorable baby pig, who was born without the use of his back legs but walks with the help of a wheelchair . Hello there: Veterinarian Len Lucero decided to adopt Chris and made him a makeshift wheelchair out of his son's toy K'Nex set . Father and pig: Dr. Len Lucero feeds Chris P. Bacon who was born without the use of his hind legs . Lucero, who lives on a farm in central Florida, brought the little pig home to his wife, two kids and menagerie of animals. The animal's official name became 'Chris P. Bacon' but informally, they called him 'Piggy' Lucero's kids loved him and snapped photos. The family dog, a black and white Australian Shepherd, became his protector. The doctor wondered how he could help the pig move easier and considered a set of wheels attached to a harness, similar to what some lame dogs use. Aren't I cute? The comically named Chris P. Bacon was born in January last year and brought to Dr Len Lucero's veterinary office in central Florida - His two back legs were deformed because of a congenital defect that left the joints fused together . Cute overload: The piglet known across the internet as Chris P. Bacon sits on the office floor of veterinarian and owner Len Lucerno in Clermont, Florida last year . I break for no one: Lucero, who lives on a farm in central Florida, brought the little pig home to his wife, two kids and menagerie of animals . His son had a set of K'nex toys – with wheels and other pieces that snap together – and Lucero built a small cart and cobbled together a tiny harness. At first, the pig didn't like the harness, but then the tiny animal got the hang of the contraption. A couple of weeks later, Lucero was at a veterinary conference and met with a representative from handicappedpets.com, a Nashua, N.H.-based company that builds pet wheelchairs, harnesses and carts. That company built a special wheelchair for Chris and created a Facebook page for the pig. Lucero and his family take him outside several times a day, where he uses his wheels.Inside, Chris has a pen with plush beds where he can scoot around or nap in air-conditioned comfort. During a recent interview, he scarfed down his favorite foods: grapes and Cheerios.","World's most famous disabled piglet with a wheelchair becomes star of PBS documentary .

"By . James  Nye . and Daily Mail Reporter . The parents of the 27-year-old camera assistant who died on set when she was struck by a freight train have claimed that the producers of the film are to blame for her death. Sarah Jones was killed on February 20 in Wayne County, Georgia and her parents Richard and Elizabeth Jones have hired an Atlanta law firm to ultimately hold someone criminally accountable. 'They did so many wrong things on so many levels, it's just unbelievable,' said Richard Jones. 'This should not have happened. It's senseless.' Demanding answers: Richard Jones, sits next to wife Elizabeth as they sit in their attorney's office while talking about their daughter Sarah Jones, the 27-year-old camera assistant killed February 20 by a freight train while filming a movie in southeast Georgia . It was the first day of shooting 'Midnight Rider,' a movie based on the life of Gregg Allman, starring William Hurt as the Allman Brothers Band singer. A freight train crossing the Altamaha River on February 20 killed 27-year-old camera assistant Sarah Jones as it plowed into a film crew in rural Wayne County. Authorities say Hurt, director Randall Miller and the crew were shooting on a railroad trestle when the train came speeding toward them at 58 mph. The train smashed into a bed the crew had placed on the tracks. Six other crew members were injured, either by the train or by flying shrapnel from the bed. Elizabeth Jones learned her daughter was dead from a close co-worker and the director called later that day. 'He was very upset,' she said. 'He kept repeating, `I'm sorry, I'm sorry.' But he wouldn't say anything else.' Answers: Elizabeth Richard Jones say they're grieving, angry and want someone held accountable for their daughter's death . Sheriff's investigators say the production crew had permission to be on private property surrounding the tracks, but not on the tracks, which are owned by CSX Railroad. Results of their investigation will soon go to prosecutors, who are weighing possible criminal charges. The National Transportation Safety Board and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration are also investigating. 'I think when everything's done and said, it will be clear the railroad never told them they could be on the tracks,' said Joe Gardner, the sheriff's lead investigator on the train collision. Donnie Dixon, a Savannah attorney hired by Miller, did not immediately return a phone call. Tragic: Elizabeth and Richard Jones, flip through photos of their daughter Sarah Jones, the 27-year-old camera assistant killed February 20 by a freight train while filming a movie in southeast Georgia . Missed: Sarah Jones was killed on February 20 in Wayne County, Georgia and her parents Richard and Elizabeth Jones have hired an Atlanta law firm to ultimately hold someone criminally accountable . The director and his company, Unclaimed Freight Productions, shelved production a week after the crash. No plans have been announced to resume shooting. Mother Elizabeth believed Sarah may have believed she had an obligation to rescue the film equipment as the train came down. 'She may well have had that in mind, not realizing the immediate danger,' Elizabeth said. 'Whatever comes from this, it has to be something positive, so that her life will not be wasted in vain. All the energy and devotion and love that she had, it can't be in vain.' At the time of the accident, the crew was shooting a dream sequence. In harm's way: Sarah's mother Elizabeth worried her daughter might have tried to save equipment without thinking about the danger she was in . But Sarah's family now calls it a nightmare. 'This is not all about Sarah; it addresses a much, much bigger problem,' Elizabeth said. 'The value of a dollar cannot be put on Sarah's life, the way that directors and producers put a dollar value on a movie. 'Everything she did was in a big way and this is a testament to her love of the camera and making a difference after everything is said and done.' Indeed, just one day before her life was tragically cut short, camera assistant Sarah Jones told her parents she was worried about the shoot and the competence of those in charge. 'She was a little nervous,' father Richard Jones told The Hollywood Reporter. 'She made a comment that some of the people asking her questions should have known more than her.' In the interview Richard describes the last message he ever received from his 27-year-old daughter. 'She was excited about meeting and working with William Hurt. That's the last text I received from her,' he said. Worried: Jones parents said she was concerned over how experienced her bosses were and was nervous about the shoot only a day before the accident that took her life . Jones' parents said their daughter, the middle of three children, was drawn to film-making from an early age. Young Sarah loved to shoot home movies starring her younger sister and the family dog. As a college student in South Carolina, she landed an internship on the TV series 'Army Wives,' her parents said, and she loved it so much she offered to stick around for free. Paid work followed on 'The Vampire Diaries' and other productions after she settled in Atlanta. As a camera assistant, the job required Jones to carry large pieces of equipment that seemed outsized for her slender, 5-foot-6 frame. Co-workers nicknamed her The Ant. An adventurous traveler, Jones was planning a trip overseas with her mother after shooting ended on 'Midnight Rider' and had begun writing a script for a film project of her own. Excitement: Sarah was most looking forward to meeting actor William Hurt . Sarah Jones was only 27 when she died on the set of 'Midnight Rider' during pre-production in Georgia . Now her parents are collecting donations to fund film-making programs in high schools. Jones' death, meanwhile, has galvanized behind-the-scenes workers on TV and movie crews to push for improved safety standards on film sets. Their outpouring of grief led to the Academy Awards briefly showing an onscreen banner with Jones' name and photo during its Oscars broadcast March 3. 'She was planning her future, planning her life ahead of her and all of a sudden it's taken away,' Elizabeth Jones said. 'She had no clue, no idea.'","The parents of Sarah Jones have expressed their anger at her death during the first day of shooting for a new Hollywood movie .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . An iconic American flag that was marched into battle during the Revolutionary War in 1775 is to be auctioned in New York. The Forster Flag, the earliest known surviving example to feature 13 white stripes representing the United Colonies, is expected to sell for more than $3 million. The strips of white silk - six on one side and seven on the other - still stand out proudly against the red background they were sewn on to 239 years ago. Iconic: The Forster Flag is the earliest known version showing white stripes to represent the original states . Historic: The flag dates from the Revolutionary War and was owned by the same family for 200 years . As well as being the oldest American flag, it is also one of only authentic colors surviving from the Revolutionary War. It may not bear much resemblance to the Stars and Stripes but the Forster Flag marks an important step in the evolution of the American flag. In 1775, the year it was was first used, early flags bearing 13 stripes - six on one side and seven on the other - to represent the United Colonies had started to appear. There were several versions, some with horizontal stripes like the current flags, and others, like the Forster color, that had short strips of white sewn to both sides. In 1776 a woman called Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag, bearing 13 stripes and a corner of stars against a blue background. The first official American flag was adopted by Congress in June 1777. Extra stars were added as more states joined. In 1814 Francis Scott Key wrote Star Spangled Banner, which became the national anthem. The American Flag, in its current form of 13 stripes to represent the original states and 50 stars to represent the current ones, was adopted in 1960 after Hawaii joined the U.S. It was carried into battle by the Manchester Company of the Essex County Militia, as they responded to an alarm for the first battle on April 19, 1775. As they marched to battle, the men carried aloft the flag, which has seven white stripes on one side, and six on the other. Although the the troops carrying the flag did not make it into battle that day, the color they carried has remained an iconic part of American history. For 200 years it was owned by the family of its original owner Samuel Forster, before being bequeathed to the Flag Heritage Foundation in Massachusetts. Proceeds from its sale, at Doyles in New York today, will be used to raise funds for the Whitney Smith Flag Research Collection at the University of Texas in Austin. The flag remains unaltered from 1775 and, according to its auction catalog entry, is in 'a remarkable state of preservation'. Some small stains and splits along the fold were noted, and the auction house said 'the flag is worn in predictable places' along the end and hoist. John Huss, president of the Manchester Historical Museum, said he longed for the flag to return to its home territory. 'It's something we would love to have,' he told the Gloucester Times, adding that the museum planned to make a bid for it. He added that the flags carried into battle were hugely important for soldiers, who would be able to use the flag to find their way back to the regiment. American history: The Forster Flag appeared in a series of stamps in 2000 . Symbolic: The Forster Flag has 13 stripes of white silk sewn on it to represent the original states . The flag has long been an important part of American history and even appeared on a stamp collection in 2000 when the U.S. Postal Service commemorated the evolution of the Stars and Stripes. The origins of the Forster Flag are unknown, but several experts have suggested that it once had a small British Union flag sewed into the top left corner. It is believed the Union flag was later pulled off and replaced by the 13 stripes. Some have even suggested that the flag . had belonged to a British regiment and was captured on the first day of . the American Revolution. The flag was due to be auctioned on Wednesday morning but no details have yet been released about its final sale price or new owners.","Forster Flag is earliest existing version that represents original states .

"By . Richard Spillett . Holly Hewett is warning others not to charge their phones overnight after her Samsung smartphone caught fire . A woman has told of her terror after she woke up to find her phone on fire beside her bed. Holly Hewett, 25, was asleep when she was woken by a 'sizzling sound' and the smell of burning. She looked down and saw her Samsung Galaxy S4 smouldering as it charged on the carpeted floor next to her. Miss Hewett grabbed the smartphone and ran to the bathroom and threw it in the sink. The civil servant said: 'I woke up at 4.30am when my boyfriend got up to go to work and looked at my phone to check the time. 'I noticed it was running low on battery so I plugged it in and put it on charge. 'At about 5am I checked the time again then rolled over and went back to sleep, but within about 10 minutes of that I heard a sizzling sound. 'Even though it was dark I could smell the smoke. I picked it up and the screen sparked. 'As I walked to the bathroom the battery fell out of the casing at the back onto the floor. 'I didn’t burn myself but there's a hole in the carpet where it scorched it. The smell was awful, so I opened a window.' She added: 'I was on my own and panicked because I'd got no house phone so I didn’t know how to contact anyone to let them know what had happened. 'In the end, after unplugging everything, I drove to my dad's house.' There are many reasons a phone could burst into flames. Lots of manufacturers have blamed knock off charger suppliers, who cut corners in their manufacturing. However, mostly it has to do with the quality of the capacitor and circuit protector in the inner workings of the phone. If these are faulty, failing to either keep the current in the phone to a low voltage, or failing to keep the hot circuits from the plastic phone coating, there can be an exponential increase in heat in the phone. This may lead to the capacitor breaking down and sending several hundred volts of electricity into the battery. This is often more than the lithium based batteries can take, and they either expand due to the bending and melting of the battery's shape, or burn up and catch fire, due to the increased heat inside the phone. The incident happened at Miss Hewett's flat in Kemsley, Kent around 5.15am last Friday morning. She said: 'I've never had anything like this happen to me before. It had only been charging for about 50 minutes, if that. 'I was extremely lucky. I'd warn others not to put their phones on charge while they are sleeping. 'Luckily I'm not a very deep sleeper, any sound usually wakes me up, but it could have been a different story.' It is not the first time smartphones and tablets have been reported to suddenly catch fire. Last June, a man in Hong Kong claimed . his flat was destroyed by fire after his Galaxy S4 burst into flames . while he was playing the game Love Machine. A month later, Swiss teenager Fanny . Schlatter, 18, suffered second and third degree burns when her . smartphone apparently exploded in her pocket. Last . year, a brand new iPad Air exploded in flames while charging in a . Vodafone mobile phone store in Camberra, Australia, store workers said. Miss Hewett threw the device into her sink after she was woken by it smouldering on her bedroom floor . Samsung have assured customers they have robust safety standards and will investigate Miss Hewett's device when they receive it . And in 2012, a schoolboy in Coventry was burned when his Blackberry Curve 9320 exploded in the middle of the night. A Samsung spokesman said: 'Once we have received the product in question, we will conduct a thorough examination to determine the exact cause of the incident. 'We would like to assure our customers that we employ robust quality controls and standards to ensure the safety of our products.' This case is not the first case recorded of this model of Samsung phone catching fire under suspicious circumstances. December 2013 . A user of the model in Canada reported his Galaxy S4 spontaneously catching fire using a post on YouTube. The phone was apparently charging, when the port next to the battery suddenly burst into flames, causing a small fire. Samsung attempted to silence the customer whose Galaxy S4 smartphone dangerously caught fire . July 2013 . Even earlier in the year a house was set on fire in Hong Kong after the same make of phone burst into flames. The . owner of the phone, a man named Du, was playing a game on the Galaxy S4 . when it burst into flames, causing him to throw the phone across the . room, where it landed on his sofa. The phone then exploded and set fire to his entire house, eventually burning it to the ground. In June of 2013, a Hong Kong resident claims his flat was destroyed by fire after his Galaxy S4 burst into flames while he was playing the game Love Machine . August 2013 . Only a month later, a Swiss teenager . suffered second and third degree burns when her smartphone apparently . exploded in her pocket. Fanny Schlatter, 18, was injured when the Samsung Galaxy S3 allegedly blew up in her trouser pocket. In July 2013, a Swiss teenager suffered burns when her smartphone apparently exploded in her pocket .

"By . Sam Webb . Paranoia about the pervasive influence of the Red Menace in the first half of the 20th century led British spymasters to investigate the Scouting   movement because they feared Communist agents were trying to brainwash impressionable young minds, it has been revealed. Espionage files released to mark the centenary of the First World War show that MI5 agents tapped phone calls between leading Communists and planned to   send an agent to an international Scouting jamboree. They even looked into Bolshevik 'plots' to take control of certain Scout troops. Red menace? Newly-released files show that MI5 feared that Communists were trying to infiltrate the Boy Scouts. Pictured, King Edward VII at a jamboree . More than 150 files created during the period of the Great War, but often extending beyond it, have been digitised by the National Archives and released   to mark the conflict's centenary. They include interrogation reports, letters, postcards and photos relating to individuals and groups under   surveillance. One memo from the 175-page dossier asks what is known about the 'Red' boy Scout movement in Britain.  The answer, reports the Daily Telegraph, was apparently not satisfactory: 'We know nothing about the red boy Scout movement.' Spy masters even looked into Bolshevik 'plots' to take control of certain Scout troops. File picture . What followed was series of intelligence investigations into the perceived threat. One reports details an incident at a jamboree on The Wirral, where   four men were arrested for distributing Communist literature. Members of the public were furious, but the Scouts reportedly shielded the agitators and, demonstrating their fire-kindling schools, torched the pamphlets. The files also contain details about the spy Mata Hari, who was covertly monitored by MI5 . But MI5's fears were apparently not without merit. William Rust, secretary of the Young Communist League, claimed his organisation was 'penetrating the   Scouts. Meanwhile, a Scout leader in erith, Kent, was approached by the 'Erith Soviet Scouncil' in the early 1920s and offered the command of the troop -   presumably an honour they thought he craved - if he accepted the top spot in their own organisation. The USSR banned Scouting in 1922, creating a separate Young Pioneer organisation of the Soviet Union. The Pioneer Movement still exists in some fashion   in China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and Tajikistan. Part of a wider security service personal file series held by the National Archives, based in Kew, south-west London, the files form part of its First   World War 100 programme of digitised releases. The files contain details of spies around the world, including famous people like British nurse Edith Cavell, who saved soldiers in German-occupied   Belgium; Mata Hari, the notorious female spy and entertainer; Arthur Ransome, author of Swallows And Amazons, and American poet and author Ezra Pound. They also contain intelligence reports and surveillance of organisations such as the Bolshevik Party and the British Communist Party, as well as files on   political figures from known fascists to communists and Russian leaders such as Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. National Archives records specialist Dr Stephen Twigge said: 'The files in the National Archives' collection reveal the importance of the security   service in safeguarding the nation during the First World War. 'Now that we have made the files available online as part of our First World War 100 programme, people across the globe can discover the secret history   behind the war for themselves.'","Spymasters feared influence of post-revolutionary Russia in the organisation .

"By . Becky Barrow . House prices will keep soaring until 2020, experts will say today. Even middle-income families will effectively be frozen out of a frenzied property market that is increasingly the preserve of the rich. The average annual gain over the next five years will be around six per cent, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Even middle-income families will effectively be frozen out of a frenzied property market that is increasingly the preserve of the rich . A chronic shortage of homes for sale – combined with high stamp duty – means some owners are unwilling to move for fear of not finding a new place. This in turn cuts the number of properties coming on to the market. ‘It is going to be ever harder for many first-time buyers to conceive of ever owning their own home,’ said the institution’s chief economist Simon Rubinsohn. ‘It is a major concern that we are not seeing enough houses coming on to the market. For the market to operate effectively, we desperately need more homes in areas where people want to buy and want to live. Until this happens, we’re likely to see prices continue to increase.’ Yesterday the IMF’s financial stability chief called on British policy-makers to show vigilance over property prices. Jose Vinals said the Bank of England had ‘the tools in order to intervene and cool down the housing market’. The report from RICS, which is published today, says house prices will rise everywhere over the next five years, from 2 per cent a year in the North to 9.3 per cent a year in London. That would put the cost of the average London home at £570,000 in 2020. The figure for the South East would be £315,000 and for the South West £280,000. The cheapest homes would be in the North (£132,000) and North West (£165,000). Among reasons cited for the property boom are low interest rates, population growth, lack of house-building and the Government’s Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. The average annual gain over the next five years will be around six per cent, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Homeowners now typically move once every 22 years, compared with once every eight years in the 1980s, according to property firm Hometrack. Rising stamp duty rates have encouraged people to stay put. A £550,000 purchase in 1996 would have attracted £5,500 in tax yet now it would be £22,000. HOUSING TABLE . The rate was fixed at 1 per cent up to 1997 but now rises as high as 7 per cent on £2million homes. This has fuelled the trend of ‘improving, not moving’, such as doing a loft conversion, digging out a basement or extending the back of the property. Estate agents warned that a desperate shortage of homes for sale is pushing up prices in hot spots.One agent from Brighton said: ‘A lack of instructions [people wanting to sell their homes] is a problem. People will not put their property on the market if they can’t see another property to buy.’ An agent from Enfield, North London, said: ‘Most properties are going under offer almost as soon as they are put on the market. Prices are increasing rapidly.’ The RICS report says a housing market recovery is ‘well and truly under way’ in Britain, but warned of a dangerous imbalance between supply and demand. Estate agents warned that a desperate shortage of homes for sale is pushing up prices in hot spots . While the number of buyers registering with estate agents has increased ‘across the whole of the UK’, the number of homes which are being put up for sale has not. An agent from Thrapston, Northamptonshire, told RICS there was ‘a major shortage of properties for sale’. Another, from Leicester, said: ‘The lack of new stock is putting significant upward pressure on prices.’ And in Reigate, Surrey, the verdict was: ‘The lack of supply has become quite marked despite the better weather and onset of spring. This appears to be the main reason for prices edging upward.’ The financial policy committee of the Bank of England has a duty to tell Chancellor George Osborne if it believes that special measures like Help to Buy are fuelling a housing boom. It can also order the banks and building societies to cut back on the share of loans committed to the housing and property sectors. Yesterday Mr Vinals said: ‘It is for the macroprudential authorities to take appropriate measures if and when they decide the housing market in the UK is getting too hot. That would be the first line of defence.’ Mr Osborne insists that three quarters of the homes bought through Help to Buy have been outside London and the South East, and the average price has been below the national average. Evidence has emerged over the past week that house prices are rising at a double-digit rate in many parts of the country amid fears of a bubble. Last week, Nationwide, the country’s biggest building society, said prices have jumped by 18 per cent in both London and Manchester in 12 months. It said prices have risen by more than 10 per cent annually in towns and cities such as Brighton, Cambridge, Oxford, Carlisle, Aberdeen, Sheffield, Bradford and Bath. Yesterday Lucian Cook, director of residential research at the estate agency Savills, said: ‘Let’s be clear – this level of house price growth in London is not sustainable. It will have to slow.’ The RICS report comes after the Council of Mortgage Lenders revealed on Tuesday that there is more mortgage debt in south-west London than all of Wales. Homeowners with a postcode which begins SW owe a total of £29.4billion, compared with only £28.6billion in Wales. Marsh & Parsons, the estate agency, said it had 48 buyers registered for every property on its books in south-west London, which includes places such as Clapham and Battersea. Official figures show home-ownership has dropped to its lowest level since the 1980s amid predictions it could eventually drop below 50 per cent. Latest figures show 65.2 per cent of households in England are ‘owner occupiers’, the lowest percentage since 1987. Home-ownership has fallen for each of the last eight years.","Middle-income families will be frozen out of a frenzied property market .

"By . Sam Webb . With his dark, floppy fringe and friendly eyes, this pig passes more than a passing resemblance to superstar comedian Michael McIntyre. Didi has been causing hilarity among staff and visitors at Blackbrook Zoological Park, near Leek, Staffordshire, after the uncanny similarity was spotted. The porker's dark, floppy fringe perfectly matches the comic's signature hairstyle. Double vision: Didi the floppy-haired pig (right) is a dead ringer for comedian Michael McIntyre (left) It was recently revealed that McIntyre has cashed in a £9 million cheque from his latest stand-up comedy tour. The comedian turned BBC1 chat show host pocketed the money for his 73-date Showtime tour, which included ten nights at London’s O2 Arena in 2012. The tour grossed £21 million, putting him on a par with the Rolling Stones or Aerosmith. Now it has been revealed that he last year paid himself and his wife Kitty the £9.23million that was left after covering costs and taxes when he wound up the company set up for the tour, Buddywaldo. Showtime made McIntyre, 38, one of the highest-grossing comics in the world, and last year he paid £2.5 million for a six-bedroom house in the Wiltshire countryside. It is a far cry from his plight a decade ago, when he was £40,000 in debt and struggling on the stand-up circuit. The BBC paid McIntyre about £500,000 to present his six-part chat show.

Many viewers have reacted enthusiastically to Mr McIntyre’s gentle observational comedy and self-deprecating manner. The comic - who is being paid £500,000 for the six-part series - spent much of the show performing stand-up routines and interacting with the studio audience.

The twin-engine aircraft encountered problems, believed to be with one of the engines, as it flew near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire. The pilot, who is said to be in his 40s, had to bring the single-seater aircraft down in a field not far from the coastal village.

"By . Andrew Levy . Donal Drohan from Harrow who died after a tree fell on his car on his way to work last year . A father-of-three was crushed to death under a rotting tree that was never inspected due to confusion at a council over who was responsible for it. Donal Drohan, 51, was driving to work when the 40ft Lombardy poplar tree snapped in the St Jude storm that lashed Britain last winter. Bystanders rushed to help as the trunk fell on his car but it is thought he died instantly. An inquest yesterday heard the tree was on land owned by Hertfordshire County Council. But its position meant it was unclear whether its highways department or a contractor was responsible for maintaining it. As a result, it had not been subjected to regular safety inspections. Fungal decay was found only after it had come down. Tree expert Arthur Clarke told the hearing the decay could have weakened the tree. Mr Drohan was one of four people who died when winds up to 100mph tore through the country. There was extensive damage to building and power lines as well as travel chaos. The operations manager for Harrow Council, north-west London, was driving through Watford at 6.50am on October 28 when the tree sheared 10ft from the ground and crashed down on to his Peugeot 207. PC Rob Jackson viewed CCTV footage of the incident and told the inquest in Hatfield it had happened ‘very quickly’. Shop workers from a nearby DIY store and other motorists battled to free Mr Drohan but were unable to move the tree. A fire crew cut the trunk away but Mr Drohan had fatal head and spine injuries. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Hertfordshire senior coroner Edward Thomas said he 'could not imagine how difficult this has been for the family.' The inquest heard that maintaining and inspecting trees on highways was the responsibility of Hertfordshire County Council and agencies they employed to do the job. However, Peter Simpson, senior asset manager at the council, said of the tree: 'Our records show it does not form part of the public highway. 'There are parcels of land that may be adjacent to the highway but according to our records do not form part of the public highway and therefore would not come under the regime of safety inspections. The scene after the tree fell on Mr Drohan's car last year during the St Jude storm . 'We have since determined that it is land owned by Hertfordshire County Council but not designated as public highway.' Mr Simpson said if they had known who owned the tree it would have been inspected by the council's property section and admitted it had 'slipped the net.' Addressing the family, Mr Thomas said of Mr Drohan: ""He was healthy, he was a good family man, working hard, enjoying his family life. ' 'The sudden and awfulness of this is unimaginable. 'There's nothing I can say that can make that any better, but I just want to acknowledge how awful this must be for you. A council spokesman said: ‘This was a tragic accident and we’d like to pass on our sympathies to Mr Dohan’s family.’ Coroner Edward Thomas gave a verdict of accidental death. Mr Drohan's family declined to comment following the inquest.","Donal Drohan, 51, died when a tree fell on his car in Watford during a storm .

"By . Rosie Taylor . A judge was applauded from the public gallery of his court for jailing two thugs who battered an old soldier on Remembrance Day. The yobs attacked 78-year-old Cyril Edmonds as he made his way home from the pub where he had been raising a glass to fallen comrades. Gary Mills, 22, and Matthew Putson, 17, hit him in the face with his own walking stick, threatened him with a knife and stole his money and phone. Police later found a combined knuckleduster and lock-knife on Putson, who had taken a cocktail of cannabis and prescription drugs. Victim: Ex-soldier Cyril Edmonds, 78, was robbed and attacked on his way home from the pub on Remembrance Day . Jailed: Gary Mills (left), 22, and Matthew Putson (right), 17, were locked up for a total of almost 12 years. Putson was handed four years, and Mills got seven years, nine months . There was spontaneous applause from the public gallery and shouts of ‘well done’ when Judge Michael Taylor jailed Mills for seven years and nine months, and Putson for four years at Teesside Crown Court on Tuesday. Mr Edmonds was knocked over when the thugs took his stick from him in the attack in Middlesbrough last year, and had to crawl to a nearby house for help. He suffered injuries to his cheek, hand and arm and his sight has since deteriorated so much that he is almost blind in his right eye. The yobs, both from Middlesbrough, admitted robbery, having an offensive weapon and a separate offence of burglary with intent to steal. Judge Taylor told them: ‘It would have been obvious to anybody that saw him he was vulnerable and elderly. ‘In a cowardly way the two of you attacked him. His stick was taken from him, he fell to the ground and you then rifled through his clothing. ‘You relieved him of his mobile phone and one of you used his walking stick against him, smashing it against his face.’ The judge also lifted a court restriction which had banned the media from naming Putson because of his age, saying: ‘The public are entitled to know what is going on.’ The junction in Middlesbrough where former soldier Cyril Edmonds was attacked . Knuckle-duster: The weapon used in the robbery of former soldier Cyril Edmonds, 78 . Great-grandfather Mr Edmonds, who has also worked as a bricklayer, said he was pleased with the sentences. ‘I’m quite happy with it. I consider they got what they deserved,’ he told the Middlesbrough Gazette. ‘They hit me in the face with my stick and they took my phone. They are just scum really. They are not going to beat me.’ But he said he will now only go to the pub when he is escorted by his son-in-law. Duncan McReddie, defending Putson, said: ‘With the benefit of a clear head he fully understands the terrible nature of this crime.’ Defending Mills, who already has two convictions for robbery, Robert Mochrie said he should be given credit for his guilty pleas. After the hearing DC Marie Appleby of Cleveland Police issued a statement saying she was ‘delighted’ with the sentences and hoped the pair ‘will now realise the severity of their actions’. She added: ‘This was a cowardly and disgraceful attack on a defenceless elderly man, who was even unable to retreat to the safety of his own home after Putson and Mills threw his walking aid out of reach.’ The sentences contrast with that of Lewis Gill who was given just four-and-a-half years in jail for killing Asperger’s sufferer Andrew Young, 40, with a punch when he asked Gill’s friend not to cycle on the pavement in Bournemouth last year.","Cyril Edmonds had been toasting fallen comrades at his local pub .

"By . Louise Boyle . A beloved dog who vanished during the huge firestorm which engulfed San Diego in 2007 has been reunited with his family. John Hartman and his family not only lost their home during the firestorm but also their black Labrador retriever Buddy. Soon after the fires, someone found the . two-year-old Lab and took him to a vet's office but the dog escaped. The Hartmans . moved to Oklahoma but never gave up on their beloved Buddy. John Hartman and his wife were reunited with their dog Buddy after seven years after losing his during the devastating San Diego wildfires in which the couple lost their home . However by an amazing stroke of luck, the Hartmans received a call from the Department of Animal Services during a recent trip to San Diego to see their son. Long-lost Buddy, now ten, had been found. The dog had been found running loose in the Imperial Beach neighborhood and was dropped off at Gaines Street Animal Shelter on March 28. He was reunited with his owners on April 1 and taken home with them to Oklahoma. Buddy was found thanks to a microchip that his owners had implanted in his neck two years before the fires. Dan DeSousa, the deputy director of Animal Services, told MailOnline: 'The story could have had a tragic ending when the dog was lost during the wildfires, but the happy ending can’t be beat.' Mr DeSousa said he believed someone had been caring for Buddy all the years that he had been missing - not no one else came forward to collect him. He said that the Hartmans had never given up hope that Buddy would come back to them. The California wildfires in October, 2007 destroyed at least 1,500 homes and burned half a million acres of land. Nine people died, 85 were injured including at least 61 firefighters. The San Diego wildfires of 2007 ravaged the city and many residents lost their homes .

"By . Associated Press . Updated: . 14:35 EST, 2 September 2011 . Half of Americans drink a soda or sugary beverage each day - and some are downing a lot. One in 20 people drinks the equivalent of more than four cans of soda each day, even though health officials say sweetened beverages should be limited to less than half a can. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the figures on Wednesday in a report said to be the government's first to offer national statistics for both adults and kids. Debate: The American Beverage Association suggested that a coalition's effort to prevent people from drinking soda was misguided . Sweetened drinks have been linked to the U.S. explosion in obesity and related medical problems, and health officials have been urging people to cut back for years. Some officials have proposed an extra soda tax and many schools have stopped selling soda or artificial juices. But advocates say those efforts are not enough, and on Wednesday a coalition of 100 organisations announced a new push. The effort includes the American Heart Association and the some city health departments who plan to prod companies to stop the sale of sugary drinks on their property or providing them at business meetings - as Boston's Carney Hospital did in April. There will also be new media campaigns, like one starting soon in Los Angeles that will ask 'If you wouldn't eat 22 packs of sugar, why are you drinking it?' The new CDC report may be ammunition. It found about half the population drinks a sugared beverage each day. Males consume more than females, with . teenage boys leading the pack. On average, males ages 12 through 19 . drink the equivalent of nearly two cans of soda each day. Poor people drink more than the more . affluent. Low-income adults got about 9 percent of their daily calories . from sugary beverages; for high-income adults it was just over 4 . percent. Blacks get more of their calories from sweetened beverages than other racial and ethnic groups. Bottled up: A factory worker watches the line at the Coca Cola bottling plant in Olifantsfontein, South Africa . The study is based on in-person interviews of more than 17,000 people in the years 2005 through 2008. They were asked to recount everything they ate and drank in the previous day. However, diet sodas, sweetened teas, flavoured milks and 100 percent fruit juice did not count. Healthy-eating recommendations call for people to limit sugary beverages to about 64 calories per day. That's a little less than half of a 12-ounce can of regular Coca-Cola, which is 140 calories. In other terms: An average can of sugared soda or juice has 10 to 12 teaspoons of sugar. There have been efforts to reduce children's access to sodas and sports drinks in schools, with beverage companies agreeing to remove full-calorie soft drinks. But the CDC study found more than half of the drinks are consumed at home. Less than 1 per cent are bought at schools or day-care centres. That's why some members of the coalition argue that parents shouldn't drink sweetened beverages, so they don't serve as a poor example at home. They hope drinking soda will become as unfashionable as smoking. Health risks: Experts warned last week obesity is fast replacing tobacco as the single most important preventable cause of chronic non-communicable diseases . A spokesman for Carney Hospital - the 149-bed Boston facility that stopped allowing full-calorie soft drink sales - said the approach makes sense. When the policy was implemented in April, sales of beverages dropped, but have gone back up, as more people apparently are adjusting to water and other non-sweetened drinks. The hospital's Dorchester neighbourhood has high rates of diabetes and other weight-related illnesses, said spokesman Joe Burnieika. 'We can't afford to feed people's bad habits if we can give them a healthy alternative,' he said. In a statement, the American Beverage Association on Wednesday suggested that the coalition's effort was misguided. Citing sales data and some other research, the industry group said sales of full-calorie soft drinks have been declining, which they credited to soda makers offering more no-calorie and low-calorie options and improved calorie labelling on the front. The statement said these initiatives 'will contribute far more to solving complex health issues like obesity than (the coalition's) sound bite solution that offers plenty of hype but no substance.' Health experts warned last week obesity is fast replacing tobacco as the single most important preventable cause of chronic non-communicable diseases, and will add an extra 7.8million cases of diabetes, 6.8million cases of heart disease and stroke, and 539,000 cases of cancer in the U.S. within the next two decades. About half of men and women in the U.S. will be obese by 2030 if current trends continue, according to a research team led by Claire Wang at the Mailman School of Public Health in Columbia University in New York. The findings, published in a special series of four papers on obesity in The Lancet, showed Obesity is most widespread in the UK and the U.S. among the world's leading economies. In Britain, obesity rates will balloon to between 41-48 per cent for men and 35-43 per cent for women by 2030 from what is now 26 per cent for both sexes, they warned. Obesity raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, various cancers, hypertension, high cholesterol, among others. Because of obesity, the U.S. can expect to spend an extra 2.6 per cent on its overall healthcare bill, or $66billion per year, while Britain's bill will grow by two per cent, or 2billion per year, Wang and colleagues warned. Worldwide, around 1.5billion adults are overweight and a further 0.5billion are obese, with 170million children classified as overweight or obese. Obesity takes up between two to six per cent of healthcare costs in many countries.","CDC report shows low-income adults got about 9 per cent of their daily calories from sugary beverages .

"By . Richard Spillett . A Brit hailed as the world's greatest living fisherman has vowed to turn into a real-life 'Jaws' hero - and stop a great white shark that is heading towards Britain. Zyg Gregorek has caught dozens of sharks, including the infamous great white, during a lifetime of extreme fishing all over the world. And the 70-year-old, from Halwill, Devon, is now preparing to turn into the real-life version of the shark hunter played by Robert Shaw in the film 'Jaws'. Scroll down for video . Zyg Gregorek, 70, from Halwill, Devon, says he expects a fight if he is to keep great white shark 'Lydia' away from British shores . Experts have tracked a great white shark, which they have called Lydia, as it swims towards Britain . But the pensioner insists he won't . harm the fish - thought to be pregnant - but insists his mission is to . weigh it and move it into safer waters before releasing it back into the . wild. The massive shark - . called Lydia - is currently being tracked by scientists in the US who . have attached GPS devices to its back to record its movements. Experts have been following the 15ft beast, who weights 2,000lbs, for over a year as part of a ground-breaking ocean life study and her progress can be followed on their website. The shark appears to be making her way across the Atlantic towards the UK coastline and Mr Gregorek is the perfect man to meet her. The grandfather-of-five holds a string of world records after spending decades chasing fish across the globe. He said: 'I've caught Great White Sharks in the past - they're very strong and are good fighters so I'd expect to battle with it for a few hours before catching it. 'I know I'm no spring chicken but I'm confident I could take it on - it would be like fighting a miniature bull but I've got all the experience behind me to do it. 'When you're out there battling with a shark you don't have time to get scared - it's man versus monster but adrenaline will keep me going. 'You just have to pace yourself and try and forget about the pain - it's mind over matter.' He has been compared to 'Quint', the shark hunter played by Robert Shaw, who famously sings 'Show Me the Way to Go Home in Steven Spielberg classic Jaws. Extreme fisherman Mr Gregorek landed a different Great White Shark - which weighed in at 1300lb - off the coast of South Africa in 2000 . Pensioner Mr Gregorek has amassed a house full of trophies in a lifetime of extreme fishing . Robert Shaw (left) as famous shark-hunter 'Quint' in Jaws, with Roy Scheider playing Police Chief Martin Brody (centre) and Richard Dreyfuss playing Matt Hooper (right) Mr Gregorek says he would use 'rubby dubby' to tempt Lydia in - a practice of luring fish by leaving mashed up fish guts in a trail behind the boat. He will then use a 130lbs line with a 50lbs clasp to hook the shark while standing on a 20ft catamaran. Mr Gregorek, who lives with wife Rose, 63, at a holiday fishing complex, normally uses a 'fighting chair' - like that used by Quint in Jaws but says he will be tackling this shark standing up. He said: 'I would have to capture the shark standing up as there are no 'fighting chairs' available which makes the catch it a lot more tiring. 'The chair has a rod hold and a harness so it's much easier and there's no need to stand up, but they're very expensive and I'm not aware of anyone who has one in the UK. 'Though I'd have two skippers on board I wouldn't have any help catching the shark as I have too much pride. 'Great White's aren't the toughest to capture so I'd feel quite confident - Tiger Sharks seem to be the most difficult to catch.' Mr Gregorek has caught two Great White Sharks in the past - one being a 1300lb off the coast of South Africa in 2000. In 2007 he was declared the world's greatest fisherman after becoming the first person to catch all 27 species in the three so-called 'royal slams' set by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA). He travelled 150,000 miles to some of the world's most remote locations to snare nine species of shark, ten species of billfish and eight species of tuna. In 2012, Mr Gregorek became the first recreational angler in history to catch five different species over 1000lbs.

"By . Louise Boyle . Disgraced Christian lawmaker Vance McAllister, who was caught on video in a steamy clinch with a female staffer, is requesting an FBI investigation today into the breach which led to a surveillance tape being leaked from his office. McAllister's chief of staff Adam Terry said on Wednesday that the Louisiana congressman will send a letter to House Speaker John Boehner asking that the leak from his Monroe district office be investigated at a federal level. The tape, which emerged on Monday, showed McAllister, a married father-of-five, kissing married staffer Melissa Peacock inside his darkened office. Mrs Peacock, 33, has since 'voluntarily resigned' from her position. Scroll down for video .

Mr Terry told the News Star: 'Clearly, what the congressman did . was wrong, and he’s taking responsibility for his actions. However, a breach in security in a federal office is a grave concern . for us.' A church minister claimed on Tuesday that McAllister's office manager in Monroe was the one who leaked the security tape. Danny . Chance, of Christian Life Church, claimed that staffer Leah Gordon had planned to take the security tape to state senator Mike Walsworth and Jonathan Johnson, a . former employee of Representative Rodney Alexander. Mr Chance told the News Star that he was not defending McAllister's actions but felt there was a 'conspiracy to bring Vance down and destroy him'. Mr Walsworth and Mr Johnson, who worked for McAllister's opponent State Senator Neil Riser, denied ever seeing the video. MailOnline requested a comment from Mr Chance on his allegations today and was awaiting a response. Ms Gordon, who worked on Rep.

"By . William Turvill . Transport in central London was severely disrupted today after a signal control room at one of the capital's busiest stations was flooded with cement. The leak at Victoria station forced Transport for London to suspend the Victoria Line between Warren Street and Brixton. The line section, which runs through stations including Oxford Circus and Green Park, closed at around 2pm this afternoon and is expected to remain disrupted for the rest of the day at least. Chaos: The Victoria Line was shut  after a signal control room was flooded with cement, so worker rushed to find sugar to stop it setting . Stranded: The leak onto signalling equipment  caused the Victoria Line to close at around 2pm between Warren Street and Brixton - it only reopened this morning . The incident took place while contractors were working on a long-term upgrade of Victoria Station. It left tens of thousands of rush hour commuters searching for an alternative way to get home, with TfL saying the line would be affected for the rest of the day. Nigel Holness, London Underground's operations director, said: ‘This afternoon our contractors were working on the new station in an area next to the Victoria line signal control room. ‘These works involved the use of water and cement which leaked into the room, damaging equipment. ‘This has meant there are no signals working on the southern section of the line. ‘Our engineers are working hard to resolve the situation as soon as possible to get services back up and running, but the line is expected to be affected for the remainder of the day while repairs are carried out.’ Error: The cement was meant for some foundations, but spread into a control room causing panic among staff . The Victoria Line section closed runs through Oxford Circus, Green Park and other popular stations . Passengers were initially told the closure was due to ‘flooding’ at Victoria Station. But pictures were later posted on the UsVsth3m website purporting to show a layer of cement in the affected room. Passengers are being advised to use the Northern and Bakerloo lines. Replacement buses are also running between Green Park and Brixton.

"By . Alex Ward . The residents of this house can get extra active indoors now they have a rock-climbing wall to get them from one floor to another. The house in the suburbs of Tokyo, Japan has been designed complete with a 23ft climbing wall as well as ladders and stairs to get around. Built by Naf Architect & Design for a family of four, the ‘3way House’ connects two floors of bedrooms and living spaces and a rooftop terrace using three different types of ‘vertical transportation’. Active indoors: A 23ft climbing wall is located in the central courtyard of this house in Tokyo, Japan which allows climbers to reach the first floor and the rooftop terrace . The rock-climbing wall is located in a central courtyard and as residents climb they can jump off at the first floor or head up to a roof terrace hidden behind a 6.5ft-high parapet. The wooden house is unassuming in its exterior but walk inside and the spacious, unique living space is revealed. Akio Nakasa from Naf Architect wrote on the website: ‘We aimed to create versatile living space which allows more opportunities to socialise with neighbours while multiplying family pleasure by closely connecting the ground and rooftop with three means of transportation. Rock-climb to rooftop: This man climbs up to the large rooftop terrace in the '3way house' 'Vertical transportation': As well as a rock-climbing wall, there are ladders and stairs in what designer Akio Nakasa says 'allows more opportunities to socialise with neighbours while multiplying family pleasure' ‘The climbing wall leads from porch to the rooftop via courtyard; ladders go up from living room through an opening to hobby room; stairs start from kitchen to sun room where laundry is hung.’ He said of the huge rooftop space: ‘The rooftop is like a room without a ceiling, surrounded by two-metre (6.5ft) wall. ‘Up on the rooftop, roofs of neighbours can be seen stretching far. ‘As the renovation of the vicinity goes on, the view from the rooftop will change with growing number of rooftops.’ The house is in a residential area where old and new buildings where new buildings are required to be at least 23ft in height.

"By . Katy Winter . A moving and visually stunning film montage has captured a woman’s pregnancy evolving in a rather unusual way. Kristi Olivares, from Manly, Australia, has created the film from clips of herself surfing in each month of her pregnancy, as well as blogging about her experience on the website She Surfs, a site dedicated to female surfers. Filmed from a camera on the end of her surfboard, Kristi records herself riding waves until she is nine and a half months pregnant. TWO MONTHS: Kristi begins to record herself surfing while pregnant almost straight away . TWO MONTHS: Just pregnant, it is impossible to tell that Kristi is expecting at the start of the video . THREE MONTHS: It is still difficult to discern any bump on slim Kristi in her third month of preganancy, as she continues to demonstrate impressive skills on her board . Often against breathtaking sunsets and showcasing the stunning Australian coastline and oceans, the film features a beaming Kristi surfing with her friends as we watch her bump, accentuated by her tight-fitting surf suit, slowly swell. Even in the late stages of pregnancy, when most women would be taking the opportunity to indulge in some serious relaxation, Kristi is seen paddling out into the ocean before leaping up to stand on her surf board, laughing and smiling as she rides the wave before falling off into the sea. Talking on her blog about the mechanics of surfing pregnant, Kristi says: ‘It is definitely getting more challenging to surf now that I am 30 weeks pregnant. Luckily I have been surfing at least four days a week throughout my pregnancy so the changes to my body and the ways that I have had to adapt my surfing have happened gradually. THREE MONTHS: Kristi's love of the ocean is obvious throughout the video, a passion clearly shared by her friends who appear in many of the clips . FOUR MONTHS: A smiling Kristi playfully wears bunny ears for a surf, sporting the tiniest hint of a bump . FIVE MONTHS: Kristi is now sporting a clear, but still small, baby bump. However, though she makes adjustments for her pregnancy, she continues to surf about 4 times a week . ‘I could ride all of my boards, including the shorter ones until I was about 14 weeks pregnant. ‘After that, even though my belly didn’t really stick out, it got uncomfortable to lie on and pop up from. ‘Because of this, I started to exclusively knee-paddle my lovely 9ft 5in long board and learned to pop up from my knees.’ The surfing fanatic had to adjust her technique throughout her pregnancy as her centre of balance changed, and we see her surfing become slightly less energetic as the film progresses. ‘The bigger my baby belly gets, the more I have to modify the way I pop up because my centre of gravity is shifting and my growing belly makes it increasingly awkward. I get tired quite easily and have to take more breaks after I paddle out to the back.’ SIX MONTHS: Although still surfing regularly, Kristi says she changed the way she paddles out (now on her knees as opposed to lying on her belly) and jumps up to standing . SEVEN MONTHS: Kristi demonstrates her considerable skill on the board . EIGHT MONTHS: With a full swollen belly Kristi is still surfing, but admits she got tired more easily and needed to take more breaks . EIGHT MONTHS: Kristi says she got a mixed response from other people for surfing when pregnant . NINE MONTHS: Kristi ends up being slightly overdue, and continues to surf right up to the line . Kristi, who has been surfing for over four years, says she was careful about when and where she surfed while pregnant, never going out in waves over shoulder height, and also was extra vigilant when she fell off. ‘If I do have a big spill, I make sure that I am in the foetal position when I am getting rolled around underwater to protect my bump and somehow I always come up smiling,’ she explains on her blog. Despite her precautions, Kristi admits that people’s reactions to her remaining so active through her entire pregnancy were not always positive. NINE MONTHS: Surfing with her bump silhouetted, Kristi says her doctor supported her decision to surf her way through her pregnancy . NINE MONTHS: Kristi says that her four years of experience enabled her to surf safely when pregnant . Kristi enjoying her last pregnant surf before giving birth at over nine and half months . The film ends with Kristi surfing against a sunset and the message 'Can't wait to introduce my baby to the sea' ‘When I tell people I am still surfing I get a strong response from them. most people are positive and happy for me while a few launch into the ""isn’t it dangerous speech"" speech. ‘Other surfers or people who spend a lot of time in the ocean understand when I say that I take wave size and water conditions into account before I paddle out and they can imagine how surfing could be modified to suit a pregnant woman. ‘It is usually people with no surfing experience who seem to imagine that I am recklessly surfing massive waves on a short board like a scene from Blue Crush. Unfortunately, those people often freely share their judgements and negativity. ‘My doctor, who surfs himself, has applauded my decision to keep surfing as part of my healthy lifestyle, recommending of course that I surf sensibly and carefully with regards to my pregnancy.’ Life's a beach, baby: Kristi Olivares, 34, surfed four days a week through her pregnancy last year and filmed her changing body as she rode the waves . 'I felt like I had to learn to catch waves all over again': Olivares said she only surfed in waves that were waist-high or smaller and would ask someone to help her carry her board to the beach .","Kristi Olivares, 34, is a passionate and experienced surfer .

The 'All I Want for Christmas is You' singer gave a two-hour concert for authoritarian Angolan President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos last Sunday, in return for the huge amount.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Daily Mail Reporter . Browsing the Marks and Spencer website, Stuart Lever came across what looked like the bargain of the century – a plush reclining armchair for 50p. The deal was so good – including free delivery and assembly – that the former Tory councillor decided to buy seven for a mere £3.50, and donate them to his local hospital. And he wasn’t the only one who spotted the bargain, with other eagle-eyed shoppers deluging the site with orders. Bargain: Marks & Spencer mistakenly advertised this £700 reclining chair for 50p on their website . One even tried to buy seven of the High Back Richmond recliner chairs costing a grand total of £3.50, rather than £4,900. But . it was all too good to be true. A technical error meant the chair . should have had a price tag of £700, and M&S has now cancelled all . orders and offered refunds. Writing . to customers, the retailer said: ‘For a short period of time on our . website, our Richmond Highback Recliner Chair was incorrectly priced at . 50p. ‘We hope you can see this was an obvious pricing error on our part and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.’ Mr Lever, 45, who was a councillor in Bolton, said: 'I was very disappointed to hear that . Marks and Spencer wouldn’t be going through with the order - as far as . I’m concerned they should honour the deal without any question. 'They . are a big company and hey should take the mistake on the chin and pay . out, they have already confirmed that they received our order. Mistake: Customers received this email from the company confirming their bargain purchase . 'If everyone kicked up a fuss, you never know they might end up changing their minds. 'I had contacted the hospital about possibly giving the chairs to the . maternity unit, but obviously that won’t be happening now.' A . Bolton Council trading standards spokesman said: ‘In cases where there . has been a clear mistake the seller is able to reject or cancel the . order as it was not a genuine contract.’ Eventually bosses at the high street chain realised their mistake and cancelled all orders and offered refunds. In . a letter to customers they said: 'We are aware that, for a short period . of time on our website yesterday, our Richmond Highback Recliner Chair . was incorrectly priced at 50p. 'During . this time an order was placed for the chair on your account and we’re . sorry to let you know that this order will not be processed further. 'We . know that this will be disappointing for you, however, we hope you can . see this was an obvious pricing error on our part and we apologise for . any inconvenience caused. 'You . will receive further emails from us today to notify you that your order . has not been progressed and a refund processed. If your order included . any additional items, apart from the chair, we’re afraid that you will . have to place a new order for those items. Apology: Marks & Spencer have now cancelled all orders and offered customers a full refund . 'Once again, we do apologise for any disappointment or inconvenience caused by this.' Initially . on its website M&S proudly trumpeted the Richmond as being . 'supremely comfortable and supportive with the split headroll lumbar . back cushion. 'The combination of comfort with the beautiful proportions and classic lines will make this a real future favourite.' It added: 'Free, eco-friendly home delivery. Our crews will unpack, assemble and position the item.' But today the chair was nowhere to be seen on the website - although other items in the same range were being offered for sale. A Marks & Spencer spokesman said the pricing mistake was down a 'technical error' which was corrected as soon as it was spotted. He said the chairs would not be sold at 50p and a full refund would be given.

"By . Sara Malm . Desperate times require desperate measures – and when an impala was targeted by two vicious cheetahs, it made a jump for it that will not soon be forgotten. The distressed animal was captured on camera leaping into a car full of tourists in order to escape the predators. The terrified animal appeared to be seconds away from death when an unexpected window of opportunity appeared – quite literally. Scroll down for video . Close call: The impala jumps into a car to escape two cheetahs in Kruger National Park in South Africa . The animal had been chased by the cheetah along with its herd when it realised it was the only one left behind. As the two ferocious animals appeared . to have cornered the impala – it leaped into a nearby car which happened . to have its windows rolled down. Samantha Pittendrigh, 20, happened to . be filming the chase when the impala jumped through the passenger-side . window of a Toyota  in front of her. She said: ‘We started freaking out going crazy. We couldn't believe it - we were absolutely dumbstruck. ‘We had absolutely no idea what was going on. ‘We watched the cheetah chasing the . impala. We saw a few of them turn around in the bushes towards the road . they were running from.' Sweet escape: A group of impala flee across a road in Kruger National Park, South Africa when one of them take an unexpected turn . Swift exit: As the last impala cross the road, the cheetahs' intended meal finds a novel way to escape . ‘All of a sudden we saw the impala . jump out of the bushes and then someone started screaming 'it is in the . car, it is in the car'. ‘We heard a little girl screaming in . the car. The boy sitting outside the car filming looked a lot younger, . so it must have been a family. ‘People in other cars screamed 'open the door, open the door'.’ In the confusion, one of the . passengers managed to open a door and the impala is seen just seconds . later trotting across the road to freedom. The cheetahs are just yards away but do not give chase. The footage was captured in Kruger . National Park, South Africa, where according to park rules you must stay . inside your vehicle at all times. As the terrified impala realises it is the cheetahs' chosen meal, it looks for a way out, and spots the car . Unexpected visit: One person inside the car appears oblivious to the fact that an impala is on its way inside the vehicle and continues to film the cheetah chase . Just dropping by: This is the moment when the impala jumps into the tourists' car in front of the chocked cheetahs . The bewildered cheetahs are left with long noses and empty stomachs as the impala disappears into the car . Miss Pittendrigh, who is studying . supply chain management at the University of Pretoria, was with her . friends Tanith Human, 20, Carmen Thvle, 21, and Michelle De Jager, 21. Unlike some of her friends, she has made several trips to Kruger National Park but was left stunned by the trip. She added: ‘My family are so jealous. In all the years my parents have been going to Kruger Park they have . never seen anything like it and we do go regularly. ‘It really is a once-in-a-lifetime thing and we managed to be in the right place at the right time. ‘I was very happy to witness something like that but I felt a sorry for the cheetah. ‘There are so many impala, it is not like they will miss one of them.’ However, the world's fastest . land-animal was not completely ‘cheetah-ed’, as one of them managed to . make a kill a mere dozen feet along the road, according to Miss .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that if he were to tell his 19-year-old self anything as he was starting to launch Facebook, it wouldn’t be anything related to business. ‘I don’t know, maybe marry Priscilla sooner,’ he said. The 29-year-old billionaire married his college sweetheart in May 2012 at a surprise ceremony in their Palo Alto home after dating for years, but apparently he feels he waited too long. Big day: Tuesday marks the 10th anniversary of the creation of Facebook and founder Mark Zuckerberg says that the company is still planning to grow . Looking back: When faced with an interview that he did at age 19 (right), he said that the advice he would have told his former self would be to marry his wife Priscilla sooner . In spite of the emotional moment during his interview with The Today Show’s Savannah Guthrie, he clammed up when she asked about the prospect of the couple adding kids to their brood anytime soon. ‘Ooh, Savannah, have you been talking to my mom?’ he joked. Instead, he admitted that couple have been focusing on their less complicated interests, saying he recently splurged on a nice grill because they like to cook and he constantly adds pictures of their pet dog, Beast. ‘He actually has more than a million fans,’ Zuckerberg said of Beast’s invidividual Facebook page. ‘He's like this ridiculously cute dog. He looks like a little sheep, he's a sheep-herding dog and he's just this little 30 pound dog and he's just amazing.’ Happy day: After meeting as students at Harvard, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg got married at their Palo Alto home in May 2012 . Having fun: Zuckerberg said that he takes tons of pictures of the dog that he and Priscilla (pictured) share, and have even created a Facebook page for the Hungarian sheep-herding dog named Beast . The mogul talked about how Facebook is continuing to grow even after reaching the 10-year milestone birthday today. ‘When I think back on this I just think, “You know, I'm one of the luckiest people in the world,”’ he said. 'Morning coffee and cuddle': The couple shared this August 10 photo on the dog's Facebook page . ‘If I'd only had a fraction of the experiences I've had, and only met a few of the people I've had the opportunity to work with, I would still be one of the luckiest people in the world. I mean, that's not lost on me. 'It's been a pretty amazing journey. It's so rare to touch a billion people's lives.’ Zuckerberg, 29, was famously still in college at Harvard when he launched the company, and said that despite recent reports, teens are not fleeing the social network. ‘Facebook and Instagram are both really popular with teens, both in the U.S. and globally. I think what you're starting to see is that there are all these different ways that people want to share and communicate. I think increasingly, people aren't going to get them all from just one app,’ he said. When asked about his company's phenomenal success, Zuckerberg put it down to the fact that he, and his employees, simply 'cared more'. ‘I've spent a lot of late nights pacing around my living room with teammates just trying to plot out what our next move can be in order to keep pushing forward on this mission, but there's always a next move,’ he told the Today Show host during an interview at Facebook’s California headquarters. ‘But one of the big things that I've taken away from the last 10 years is, there's always a next move and you just need to keep on pushing forward and keep on doing the best thing that you can.’ Last week, the company has had the largest single-day stock rise since July 2013, jumping from $53.47 to $61.03 per share. Making a jump: The increase in company's stock last Wednesday from $53.47 to $61.03 per share was the highest single-day jump since July 2013 . Future plans: One of the biggest projects that Zuckerberg is working on is called internet.org, which is trying to help connect more people to the internet across the globe . The company’s share price has remained high, and is currently at $62.38 per share on Tuesday morning. Facebook's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.585billion from $1.585 billion in the year-ago period, beating analysts' average expectation of $2.33billion. Facebook said on Wednesday that revenue from mobile ads represented 53 per cent of its total fourth-quarter advertising revenue, up from 49 per cent in the third quarter.","Today marks Facebook's 10th anniversary .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . With its manicured lawns, tropical foliage and neat bungalows, this idyllic setting on the edge of the Florida everglades would make for an ideal retirement community. Miracle Village, however, is home to more than 100 registered sex offenders - half of its population - who have abused minors, viewed child pornography or even molested their own children. Among them are a teacher, a pastor and a sports coach. More than half of the population of this Florida village on the edge of the everglades are sex offenders . Reminiscent of a retirement village: The area has manicured lawns, tropical foliage and neat bungalows . The 24-acre community was built in the 1960s to house sugar cane workers. In 2009 the late Dick Witherow, a pastor with the Christian group Matthew 25 Ministries, began making housing available to sex offenders. Witherow came up with the idea for the village largely because of a Florida state law that prevents offenders from living within 1,000ft of a school, park, day care centre or playground. Some cities and counties have extended that to 2,500ft. Forced out of densely populated areas, Miracle Village offers sex offenders a place to live away from those restrictions - and it's proved so popular there are between 10 and 20 applications from potential residents every week. The village is located about three miles from any other neighbors. It is self-contained, with its own water supply and sewage treatment plant. Registered sex offenders living in the village include Pat Powers (left), the director of the Christian ministry that offers the housing to offenders, and Christopher Dawson (right), 22,  convicted of having sex with a minor . In demand: Miracle Village has proved so popular there are between 10 and 20 applications from potential residents every week . 'In the beginning, no one wanted us around,' said Pat Powers, a sex offender who is now director of Matthew 25 Ministries, in an interview  in March with the Orlando Sun-Sentinel. 'But it's totally changed, now we're a part of the community.' Married couple David and Lecil Woods said they would have no place to live if it weren't for Miracle Village. David was convicted of a sex offense for engaging in what he claims was consensual sex with his girlfriend at the time, who was 16 years old. 'We had searched for places to live and nobody would rent to us,' Lecil Woods told the New York Times. 'If it wasn't for this place we would be homeless.' The village does not allow offenders who are convicted of violent sex crimes against strangers. Jerry Youmans, the intake coordinator . for the ministry who is also a registered sex offender, told the BBC: 'We . try not to accept people with a history of violence or drugs, or to take . any diagnosed paedophile - that is, someone who can only become . sexually aroused by a child. The village was set up in 2009 by the late Dick Witherow, a pastor with Matthew 25 Ministries, in large part because of state law that prevents offenders living within 1,000ft of a school, day care centre or playground . 'We want to protect the people who are already here and those who were living here before us.' Some children do live in the village, however, as state laws allow sex offenders to live in the same neighborhood as minors, although some may be banned from having contact with them. One such resident is 22-year-old . Christopher Dawson, who is barred from speaking to anyone under 18 after . he had sex with a 14-year-old who he believed was older. He was sentenced to two years' house arrest followed by probation for eight years. After breaching the terms of his licence, he was ordered to the village by a judge. 'It's been a blessing in disguise... I feel as though I have a destiny with Miracle Village. I feel at home and safe here - I love the people,' he said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For the second time in a week, a python has swallowed a family pet in the backyard of an Australian home. After last week's dog-swallowing incident in Caniaba, New South Wales, a snake has followed suit in Queensland's idyllic Whitsundays, the Daily Mercury reports. Michelle Grigg says she found Walter, the family dog, in the belly of a python that had crept on to her property. Scroll down for video . Another one...? This python swallowed the Grigg family's beloved pooch Walter . Cringeworthy stuff: Michelle Grigg says she has been dealing with snakes on her property ever since she was a girl - but not like this . 'My husband went out on the road to look for him,' she said. 'I was standing out on our patio where we have big pot plants and I looked down at my feet and there was the snake.' While she didn't seem terribly fussed, having dealt with snakes since she was a child, she admits her kids were more shaken up by the death of the Maltese-Shih tzu cross. 'I was very calm. I'm good in stressful situations,' she said. 'I woke them up for school and told them what had happened. They were absolutely devastated and my son wanted me to have killed it so he could have buried Walter. 'But I picked up the snake and relocated it.' Michelle wrestles the python into a plastic container after it attacked and ate Walter (R), the family pet who was a gift from the children's aunt . Michelle's young children were devastated by the death of the family dog, a gift from their aunt . Ms Grigg says her seven-year-old daughter didn't take the news well. 'This little dog was given to her as a gift from her aunty, it was her everything,' she told The Courier-Mail. Last week a python swallowed a 'possum-sized' dog and a length of chain after pouncing on the pet pooch's kennel. Animal rescue volunteer Sue Ulyatt from the Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service (WIRES) said it was rare to see a snake swallow a dog. 'We’ve just checked our stats and it's actually only the second time in the last ten years that we know of,' she said last week. 'It's usually the other way around; the snake comes off second best.'

"By . Associated Press . and James Gordon . After several recent Southern California earthquakes left them sensitive to shaking, people around the region thought they felt the ground move earlier this week. But this rumble came from the air. U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kevin Stephens told the Los Angeles Times  on Thursday that the shaking was a sonic boom produced by an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet. The jet was over the Pacific Ocean about 35 miles southwest of San Diego when it broke the sound barrier. Whats that noise? The rumble was created by an F/A-18 Hornet fighter plane. The jet was over the Pacific Ocean about 35 miles southwest of San Diego when it broke the sound barrier . Some residents in Long Beach and the north Orange County coast reported feeling and hearing what some thought was an earthquake. But Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton said no earthquakes were reported in the area during the time the shaking was reported. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor to the LA Times that any sonic boom would come from a military aircraft. 'Civil aircraft do not exceed the speed of sound, so any sonic boom would come from a military aircraft,' he said. Long distance: Although the military exercise was bring carried out 100 miles away, the sound traveling at 760mph soon reached the coastline . 'Military aircraft do not fly supersonically in civilian airspace; they would only do so in restricted military airspace out over the ocean.' Sonic booms move in the direction a jet is flying, and because it was pointed northward the rumble was felt in Orange and Los Angeles counties. While some may equate sonic booms to sounding like sharp cracks, the farther away you are from the jet, the more likely you might hear a rumbling sound that can shake buildings. NASA aerospace engineer Edward Haering compared it to lightning strikes. The closer you are to the lightning, the more likely you’ll hear a sharp crack. The farther away you are, the more likely you’ll hear a rumble. The F/A-18 was flying as part of a demonstration of the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, whose home port is in Coronado. It was a fighter jet: Although some have speculated it could be the testing of the mythical top-secret Aurora spy plane project . The plane flew faster than the speed of sound as part of an exercise  50 miles off the coast. The speed of sound is about 761 miles per hour. It can be hard for pilots to know where and how far sonic booms will travel. A lot depends on the weather and the direction of the wind, which helps determine where the sound will go. Some have speculated it could be the testing of the mythical top-secret Aurora spy plane project. When the Navy conducted a similar flight further south in the summer of 2012, most of San Diego felt it . Many who felt the shaking took to social media, assuming it was an earthquake. Scott Conner told the Times that he was convinced it was a quake and was the biggest he had ever experiences. 'I thought it was the biggest quake I’ve ever been in…. This thing was big, big,' he said. 'The whole house just lifted.'","Mysterious rumbling along coast wasn't earthquake, experts say .

"By . Associated Press . Traffic judge: Judge Joseph Charter doesn't usually have freedom of speech cases come through his traffic court . Hauling a truckload of logs to a Southern . Oregon mill last fall, Chris Hill noticed a sheriff's deputy behind him . and flashed his lights to warn a UPS driver coming the other way. The deputy pulled over Hill on U.S. Highway 140 in White City and handed him a $260 ticket for improperly using his headlights, saying another deputy had seen the flashing lights from behind the UPS truck and alerted him to stop the log truck because of the signaling. Outraged, Hill decided to fight the ticket, and on Wednesday, a Jackson County Justice Court judge dismissed the citation, finding that motorists flashing their headlights amounts to speech protected by the Oregon Constitution. Judge Joseph Carter . determined the law covering the use of high beams was valid, but was . unconstitutional as it was applied by the deputy. 'The . citation was clearly given to punish the Defendant for that . expression,' the judge wrote. 'The government certainly can and should . enforce the traffic laws for the safety of all drivers on the road. However, the government cannot enforce the traffic laws, or any other . laws, to punish drivers for their expressive conduct.' The Jackson County Sheriff's Office did not return a telephone call for comment. Hill, 38, of Klamath Falls, . has been driving truck for 10 years, and was not interested in seeing . his insurance rates go up for getting a ticket. He initially told the . deputy that the UPS driver was his neighbor, and he was just saying . hello. 'My point to the cop . was his partner didn't know why I was flashing my lights,' Hill said. 'He couldn't tell for sure what I was doing.' By the time his case went to court last month, Hill had researched the law and found nothing that expressly prohibited the use of headlights to signal other drivers. He also recalled a TV news story about a federal judge in the Midwest barring police from handing out tickets to drivers who flashed their lights to warn others of a speed trap ahead. Fought the law: Chris Hill fought his $260 ticket issued for flashing his headlights to warn another driver of police presence - and won . 'I thought, 'Well, I'll throw that in there, too,""' he said. Acting as his own attorney in a hearing conducted by telephone, Hill said he acknowledged the UPS driver wasn't his neighbor, and he raised the free speech argument. 'What I did wasn't illegal, whether it's freedom of speech or not,' he told The Associated Press. Dave Fidanque, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, noted the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned a traffic law prohibiting horn honking for non-traffic purposes on similar grounds in the 1990s after a number of people got tickets for honking in support of U.S. troops during the first Gulf War. 'If the motive of the sheriff's deputies was in fact not to make the roads safer, but to raise more revenue from traffic enforcement, that would be even more reason why it should be unconstitutional,' Fidanque said. 'If this is part of a pattern, then it probably would be worth us looking into it in more detail.'","Trucker Chris Hill noticed a police car behind him in Oregon and flashed a UPS driver coming the other way to warn him .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Amazon has taken a gamble that its staff love working for the internet company by offering them the chance to leave for $5,000. The Pay to Quit offer is made each year to staff, who can claim a payout and walk away from their positions in Amazon's fulfillment centers. The web company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, says the payout gives unhappy employees a way out, which is good for staff and for Amazon. Choices: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is offering to pay unhappy staff to leave . Once a year, employees in its vast warehouses where orders are packaged and mailed out, are sent a letter that begins: 'Please don't take this offer.' As well as a quit option, the staff are offered the chance to claim up to 95 percent in tuition fees so they can take college courses for in-demand jobs - even if that means that in the long term they will leave the company. Mr Bezos, who explained the policy to shareholders this week, said it encouraged 'folks to to take a moment and thing about what they really want'. According to CBS, only a small percentage of the workers take up the deal each year. Amazon, which employees more than 97,000 people around the world, adopted the idea for the Pay to Quit deal from clothing retailer Zappos, which it took over in 2009. Forward-thinking company Zappos offers new recruits the chance to leave for a $2,000 pay off after they . have completed a four-week training period, as a way to show how much . they value staff. Deal: Staff at fulfillment centers such as this one in California can walk away with a check . Motivated: The Pay to Quit deal and an offer to pay for college tuition are being used to boost morale . Tony Hsieh, chief executive of Zappos, said that only 3 percent of the new recruits accepted the offer. In the offer made to Amazon's warehouse staff, the amount available starts at $2,000 in the first year and rises by $1,000 each year until reaching a $5,000 cap. Staff can also apply for funding to retrain, even if that means they will ultimately leave. 'We know that for some of our . fulfillment center employees, Amazon will be a career,' Mr Bezos said. 'For others, Amazon might be a stepping stone on the way to a job . somewhere else - a job that may require new skills. If the right . training can make the difference, we want to help.' The offer is limited to staff in the warehouse who have previously complained to Amazon about pay problems and claims that they are forced to work in an intensely hot environment.","Pay to Quit deal ensures workforce stays happy, chief executive says .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . Plot: Kelvin Melton 'ordered the killing of the dad of the prosecutor who locked him up for life' An imprisoned gangster used a smuggled cell phone to mastermind the terrifying kidnap of the father of a prosecutor who helped send him away for life, federal authorities said. Frank Arthur Janssen, a North Carolina military contractor whose daughter prosecutes violent crimes, was rescued in a raid on an Atlanta apartment by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team on Wednesday night. Authorities arrested five people - aged between 19 and 21 - who allegedly have connections to the Bloods gang. They were acting on behalf of Kelvin Melton, who is serving a life sentence for . ordering the shooting of a man in 2011, said John Strong, the FBI's . agent in charge for North Carolina. During the abduction, the kidnappers took a picture of Janssen tied up in a chair and sent it to his wife, threatening to torture and dismember him if she went to police, the FBI said in court documents. They also allegedly exchanged at least 123 calls and text messages with Melton in the past week as they discussed how to kill and bury 63-year-old Janssen without a trace. The suspects were found nearly five days after the kidnapping after authorities tracked their mobile phones and listened to their calls. Authorities are now investigating how Melton, 49, got a mobile phone in his cell at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner. Smuggled phones usually come from relatives or other visitors, AP reported. Plot: Frank Arthur Janssen, 63, right, was . kidnapped earlier this month allegedly by five gang members who wanted . to get back at his daughter, who prosecuted on a case that put their . friend behind bars . Testimony from his 2012 trial shows . Melton is a high-ranking member of the Bloods street gang from New York . City who ordered a 21-year-old subordinate to travel to Raleigh and kill . his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. Court . records show Melton has a long record of felony convictions in New . York, the first being a 1979 robbery committed when he was 14. The . admitted triggerman, Jamil Herring Gressett, testified that he followed . Melton's orders for fear he or his loved ones would be killed if he . didn't. The victim survived a gunshot wound. The . prosecutor in the case was Wake County Assistant District Attorney . Colleen Janssen - kidnapping victim Frank Janssen's daughter. In a handwritten 2012 letter in the court file, Melton protested that the prosecutor had not followed proper legal procedure, citing a specific state statute. Raid: An image shows federal agents walking through an apartment complex in Atlanta after the agents rescued Janssen on Wednesday night. He was not harmed in the kidnapping or the rescue . Audience: Neighbors watch as the agents stand guard at the apartment following the raid . Authorities have revealed text messages sent by the alleged gang members to the kidnap victim's wife, as well as details of a call between the gang and their mastermind, Kelvin Melton. Texts from the 'gang' to Christie Janssen . If you contact police, 'we will send (Mr. Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take . someone in your family to Italy and torture them and kill them... we . will do drive by and gun down anybody.' At 12.19am Wednesday, she . received a text photograph of him tied up in a chair. 'Tomorrow we call you again an if you can not tell me where my . things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.' Call between 'gang' and 'mastermind' At . 8.20pm on Wednesday, Melton called the kidnappers and they apparently spoke about where to bury Janssen's body: . 'The first spot we are checking out is close to the house.' 'We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep.' 'Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth.' 'However you feel like doing it, just do it.' 'Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind.' 'Prosecutor must file accuser affidavit with clerk of court 'prior' to seeking an indictment, this affidavit must be on file, mandatory!' Melton wrote. 'The accused indictment is not legal and is rendered in-valid.' But it didn't work and Melton was . convicted of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and being a . habitual felon, resulting in a life sentence. The . case came back to haunt the Jenssen family when a woman knocked on . Frank Janssen's door on Saturday at his Wake Forest home. Several people . assaulted him and someone used a stun gun. He . was then driven 400 miles away to Atlanta and his wife, Christie, . returned home from a shopping trip to find him gone from the home and . drops of what appeared to be blood on the ground. On Monday, Christie started receiving a series of text messages from a mobile phone in Georgia. One . of the texts said if law enforcement was contacted, 'we will send (Mr. Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take . someone in your family to Italy and torture them and kill them... we . will do drive by and gun down anybody.' At 12.19am Wednesday, Janssen's wife . received a text photograph of him tied up in a chair along with a . message: 'Tomorrow we call you again an if you can not tell me where my . things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.' The messages made specific demands . for the benefit of Melton, according to the FBI. Those demands were not . spelled out in the court filings and authorities would not provide . further details. A . federal law enforcement source told the Associated Press that the . kidnapping was an act of retaliation and that the communications of . those involved suggested a link to the Bloods.

The next morning: The agents raided the apartment around midnight and five people were arrested . Cruel: The five kidnappers allegedly tied up Janssen and sent a photo to his wife to blackmail her . Probe: FBI agents can be seen gathering evidence from the scene following the successful rescue . At 8:20 p.m on Wednesday, the FBI says a call was placed by Melton from the prison to a phone associated with the kidnappers in Atlanta. The two male callers appear to be discussing how to dispose of a body: . 'The first spot we are checking out is close to the house.' 'We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep.' 'Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth.' 'However you feel like doing it, just do it.' 'Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind.' Following . the call, authorities tried to enter Melton's cell and he temporarily . barred the door and smashed the phone. A few hours later, they located . Janssen in Atlanta at the Forest Cove Apartments. Target: A news crew sets up equipment opposite the Wake Forest home of the kidnap victim . Charged with kidnapping were: Jenna Paulin Martin; Tiana Maynard; Jevante 'Flame' Price; Michael 'Hot' Montreal Gooden and Clifton James Roberts. Authorities also recovered a .45-caliber handgun, picks and a shovel, according to the FBI. According to the complaint, the women and Roberts conspired to kidnap Janssen while Price and Gooden were the 'night watch' over him. Those arrested appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Atlanta on Thursday. They are due back in court for a bond hearing Tuesday, when they will each have a lawyer appointed by the judge. According to prison records, Melton is being held on 'maximum control' status after racking up several infractions over the past year, including being cited for possessing a weapon and twice for having a mobile phone. In 2013, 747 mobile phones were confiscated from inmates in North Carolina's prisons. So far this year, 166 have been seized. Authorities: John Strong, special agent in charge of the FBI in North Carolina, said the kidnapping was related to his daughter's prosecution work as he spoke at a press conference on Thursday . Officials at the state Department of Public Safety concede many are smuggled in by prison employees bribed by inmates or their relatives. They are now investigating how Melton got the phone he allegedly used to help orchestrate the kidnapping of his prosecutor's father. 'The department is deeply concerned about any corrupting influence by inmates against Adult Correction employees and will aggressively investigate and take action against offenders and staff involved in using cellphones to conduct criminal activity from inside prison walls,' Secretary Frank L. Perry said. 'It will continue its ongoing efforts with increased intensity toward stopping contraband from entering any of its facilities.'","Kelvin Melton communicated with 5 gang members from his jail cell after they kidnapped Frank Arthur Janssen, 63, from his home on Saturday .

"By . Dan Bloom . Miracle: Kelly Cays, 22, and her fiance Zach Rose were saved by an anonymous benefactor . A woman whose car was stolen and trashed with her $1,800 wedding dress inside has been saved in time for the big day – after an anonymous ‘angel’ bought her a new gown. Kelly Cays, 22, was devastated after her Jeep turned up in an alleyway with the all-lace gown missing in her home town of Colorado Springs. Several women offered her their gowns after the crime appeared in her local newspaper, but the search seemed hopeless because none would fit Miss Cays’ 5ft 1in frame. She put down a $400 deposit on a new gown, but could not afford the balance because she used all her spare cash fixing her trashed car. That was until a miracle struck at the bridal shop. Out of the blue, the manager phoned Kelly to tell her a ‘wedding angel’ had paid the $1,400 cost of an identical gown. Miss Cays – who still has no idea who the mystery woman was – joked she would be sleeping with the dress every night until the big day in June. She told Today: ‘She said that she had amazing news and that someone had come in and anonymously paid off my dress. ‘I just started crying. I’m so thankful. They don’t even know me, and it was a wonderful thing to do. ‘I’m so, so grateful. If I can find her, she can come to the wedding.’ Miss Cays had received the original gown as a gift from two aunts and chose it because it reminded her of the one her late grandmother wore 60 years earlier. She and fiancé Zach Rose scoured pawn shops in the hope the dress had been traded, but to this day it has not turned up. Saviour: The mystery woman donated $1,400 at Danelle's Bridal Boutique in Colorado Springs, pictured . It is far from the first wedding miracle. In February a newlywed couple in Britain survived a 30ft tree toppling onto their car as they drove from their wedding ceremony to the reception. Lee True, 36, and his new wife Clare, 40, were driving away from the wedding in fierce winds in their Peugeot 206 when the car buckled under the force of the blow. Miraculously the pair only suffered minor injuries - while Lee’s two children James, seven, and Charlie, five, and their dog Tilly, walked away completely unharmed.","Kelly Cays, 22, had $1,800 gown in the back of her Jeep when it was stolen .

"By . Associated Press . Subway says an ingredient dubbed the 'yoga mat' chemical will be entirely phased out of its bread by next week. The disclosure comes as Subway has suffered from an onslaught of bad publicity since a food blogger petitioned the chain to remove the ingredient. The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a bleaching agent and dough conditioner. It can be found in a wide variety products, including those served at McDonald's and Starbucks and breads sold in supermarkets. But the petition gained attention after it noted the chemical was also used to make yoga mats. Subway says an ingredient dubbed the 'yoga mat' chemical will be entirely phased out of its bread by next week . The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a bleaching agent and dough conditioner but the chemical is also used to make yoga mats and shoe rubber . Tony Pace, Subway's chief marketing officer, told the AP in a phone interview that the chain had started phasing the ingredient late last year and that the process should be complete within a week. Subway is privately held and doesn't disclose its sales figures. But it has apparently been feeling pressure from the uproar. 'You see the social media traffic, and people are happy that we're taking it out, but they want to know when we're taking it out,' Pace said. 'If there are people who have that hesitation, that hesitation is going to be removed.' He repeated that Subway was 'happy to invite consumers back in who might've had hesitation.' Subway, which has about 26,600 U.S. locations, had said soon after the petition surfaced in February that it was already in the process of removing the ingredient. At the time, however, the company wouldn't provide details on a timeline, prompting some to say that the chain didn't really have a plan to remove the ingredient. Pace stressed that the removal wasn't a reaction to the petition and that the changes were already underway. The company also provided a statement saying it had tested the 'Azo-free bread' in four markets this past fall. 'We're always trying to improve stuff,"" Pace said. For instance, he noted that the chain has also reduced sodium levels over the years and removed of high-fructose corn syrup from its bread.

The blogger who created the Subway petition, Vani Hari of FoodBabe.com, has said she targeted Subway because of its image of serving healthy food. Hari has also called on other companies including Chick-fil-A and Kraft to remove ingredients she finds objectionable. The sentiment is one that has been gaining traction, with more people looking to eat foods they feel are natural and examining labels more carefully. The trend has prompted numerous food makers to adjust their recipes, even as they stand by the safety of their products. Among the companies that have made changes are PepsiCo Inc., which removed a chemical from Gatorade, and ConAgra, which simplified the ingredients in its Healthy Choice frozen meals.","The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . Pope Francis, pictured during a meeting with the Italian pro-life movement, at the Vatican today, has said he takes personal responsibility for the 'evil' of priests who sexually abused children . Pope Francis has said he takes personal responsibility for the 'evil' of priests who sexually abused children, asking forgiveness from victims and saying the church must be even bolder in its efforts to protect the young. It was the first time a pope has taken personal responsibility for the sex crimes of his priests and begged forgiveness. Francis made the off-the-cuff remarks after coming under criticism from victims' advocacy groups for a perceived lack of attention to the sexual abuse scandal and continuing demands that he sanction bishops who covered up for paedophiles. He delivered the comments to members of the International Catholic Child Bureau, a French Catholic network of organisations that protects children's rights. Sitting with them in his library, Francis spoke slowly and softly in his native Spanish, deviating from his text. 'I feel compelled to take personal responsibility for all the evil that some priests, many - many in number, (although) not in comparison with the totality - to assume personal responsibility and to ask forgiveness for the damage caused by the sexual abuse of the children,' he said. 'The church is aware of this damage,' he continued. 'We don't want to take a step back in dealing with this problem and the sanctions that must be imposed. 'On the contrary, I think we must be even stronger. You don't play around with the lives of children.' No pope has ever taken personal responsibility for the tens of thousands of children who were molested by priests over decades as bishops moved them from parish to parish rather than reporting them to police. Pope John Paul II denounced priests who hurt children, saying there was no place for them in the priesthood. Pope Francis speaking with members of the Delegation of the International Catholic Child Bureau (BICE) during an audience today . Pope Benedict XVI expressed sorrow and regret to victims, met them and even wept with them. But neither ever took personal responsibility for the scandal or begged forgiveness as Francis did. Last month, Francis named the initial members of a commission to advise him on best practices to combat sexual abuse in the church. Half of them are women and one, Marie Collins, was assaulted by a priest as a child. Irishwoman Ms Collins, who became a well-known activist in the fight for victims' justice, had previously called on Benedict to ask personal forgiveness for the scandal and those church leaders who put loyalty to the church ahead of the safety of children. The Vatican has said Ms Collins and the other members will draft the statutes of the commission and will look into the legal 'duties and responsibilities' of church personnel, a suggestion that they might take up the critical question of disciplining complicit bishops. Pope Francis delivers his blessing during a meeting with the Italian pro-life movement, at the Vatican today . Church law provides for sanctions if a bishop is negligent in carrying out his duties, but to date no bishop has been disciplined for protecting an abuser. Though unclear, Francis's comments about the 'sanctions that must be imposed' could similarly be a reference to the need to make bishops accountable. Francis named the commission members after coming under fire for taking no action since the commission was announced in December. Victims' groups also have been irked that he has not met survivors and recently told a newspaper that the church had been unfairly attacked for its abuse record.","Pope Francis said he felt compelled 'to personally ask for forgiveness' for damage caused to those who were sexually abused by priests .

"By . Scarlett Russell . Waxing styles can differ greatly but the latest fad gives the best of both worlds with a tiny bit of hair on top and nothing below . Whether it’s Brazilian, Hollywood or a simple bikini line tidy, most women have a personal preference when it comes to their waxing needs. The traditional Brazilian wax involves removing all the hair from the back and front of the lower region, but leaving a strip or triangle shape at the top - often cheekily referred to as a landing strip. But the new ‘full-bush’ version leaves the top area of your pubic hair fully grown. NY Mag . reported the trend after a journalist for the mag was informed by her . own waxing therapist that it was becoming more and more popular. During . a regular appointment at her salon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the . writer's waxing got to chatting about the latest treatments they were . offering and explained that more patrons had requested the new version. But although the trend may have started in the States, it’s popular amongst British women, too. ‘We’ve had a lot of requests for this, . but we call it a Brazilian with Hollywood lips,’ says Caron Vetter, . Managaing Director of the Belmore Centre in Aylesbury. According to Vetter, women like having the mix of a hint of natural pubic hair but like keeping the area bare below. 'We’re often told that women feel cleaner and more hygenic when there is less hair down there,' she explains. ‘But, at the same time, many women still like having some pubic hair along the mound. ‘In the last two to three years we’ve found the more intimate types of waxing are more popular and I wouldn't be surprised if this trend carried on.' After all, said Vetter, the traditional Brazilian wax was once deemed a fad, but it's now one of the most popular preferences amongst British women.","Trend started in the US but is growing in popularity in the UK .

Ahmed Sofyan, 37, of Jakarta, Indonesia, was charged with two counts of lewd or lascivious molestation and one count of false imprisonment after being taken into custody Thursday by authorities. The cruise line notified both local authorities and the FBI when it learned of the claims made by the girl, according to WKMG. It occurred aboard the Disney Dream ship. ‘We have no tolerance whatsoever for the behavior alleged in this incident,’ Karl Holz, President of Disney Cruise Line, said in a press release. ‘We are sorry that anything of this nature could have occurred on one of our ships,’ he continued.‘We place enormous value on the trust our guests have in us, and nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of each and every one of our guests.’ The incident was reported by the Orlando Sentinel to have occurred during ‘turnaround day,’ when passengers disembark and others board.

"By . Darren Boyle . FBI agents have arrested three men who they claim hacked top-secret US Army helicopter simulator software as well as pre-release computer games such as 'Call of Duty' on the Microsoft Xbox game system. The group has been charged with breaking into the computer systems and stealing the data, which included simulation software from the fearsome Apache attack helicopter. Court documents show that one of the men is alleged to have used stolen technical details to create his own counterfeit Microsoft Xbox One machine which he later sold on eBay for $5,000. The FBI has charged (right) Sanadodeh Nesheiwat, 28, and (left) Nathan Leroux with 15 felony charges including computer hacking after the gang allegedly breached a  US Army helicopter simulator to steal the software to create a counterfeit Microsoft Xbox version of Call of Duty . The men, Sanadodeh Nesheiwat, 28, from New Jersey, Nathan Leroux, 19, from Wisconsin and Canadian resident David Pokora are facing 15 felony charges of conspiracy, fraud and computer hacking following a major FBI investigation. FBI agents believe that a man from North Carolina and an Australian teenager were also involved in the high-tech scheme. The US Army contracted Zombie Studios to develop simulation software to help train pilots to use the Apache helicopter (pictured) The three men were named by federal prosecutors in a sealed indictment which has just been released. The 54-page document was published by The Smoking Gun after the three men were charged. The case was brought before a grand jury in July 2013 at the US District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. It is understood that the FBI waited eight months before serving arrest warrants on Nesheiwat, Leroux and Pokora. The FBI claims the three men used information stolen from Microsoft to make their own counterfeit Xbox One console . Prosecution documents claim the three men targeted 'network weak points' to gain illegal access to computer systems. The men are accused of hacking into Microsoft as well as several computer game developers including Valve Corporation, Activision Blizzard, Zombie Studios and Epic Games. Prosecutors believe the men accessed the networks in a bid to illegally download games that were still in development including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The FBI claim the three men hacked various computer networks to download pre-release versions of popular games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (pictured) Later, after breaching the Zombie Studios secure network network, prosecutors allege  the men then were able to access the AH-64D Apache Simulator programme. It is understood the US Army contracted the Seattle based games company to develop the training software. The FBI believe that the men were involved in the scheme between 2011 and 2012 while Microsoft had its new Xbox One game system under development. It is understood the men used the 'internal design and technical specifications and pre-release operating system software code' to build their own counterfeit machine which they sold on eBay for $5,000. The indictment claims that Leroux then allegedly attempted to build a second counterfeit xBox. The court documents show the FBI had the cooperation of one individual described in court documents as 'Person A' from Delaware. He claims Leroux gave him a counterfeit console which he was due to post to the Republic of Seychelles. The indictment said 'Person A' had a Skype conversation with Pokora who asked him for assistance on encrypting his hard drive. Pokora is alleged to have asked: 'I need your help. I'm going to get arrested.' In a second call, Pokora is claimed to have said: 'If we do this right, we will make a million dollars each.' FBI investigators allege that the men also wanted to gain access to the latest games in the Call of Duty franchise (pictured) while still under development .","FBI agents claim gang hacked a top-secret US Army helicopter simulator .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Detroit teenager was charged with assault and a hate crime today over the brutal mob beating of a driver who stopped to help a boy he had accidentally hit with his pickup truck. The 16-year-old boy, who has not been named, is the only one of five people charged in the April 2 attack on Steve Utash to face an ethnic intimidation count. Mr Utash, a 54-year-old grandfather is white, and the teenager and four adults charged in his beating are black. Attacked: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr, is in a medically induced coma after being beaten on April 2 . Crime scene: Steve Utash was beaten outside this gas station when he stopped after knocking into a child . 'In the case of the 16-year-old charged . as a juvenile we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crimes of . assault with intent to do great bodily harm and ethnic intimidation,' Kym Worthy, Wayne County's prosecutor, said. 'In the case of the four . adult defendants that have been charged, the facts and the evidence does . not support a charge of ethnic intimidation.' Black leaders, Detroit's mayor and others across the city have spoken out against the attack. A prayer vigil and Night of Healing program is scheduled for 7pm today at Historic Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit. 'We need to send a crystal clear statement to the world that the violent actions of a few individuals will not cast a cloud of negativity over our city,' the Rev Jim Holley, the church's pastor, said. 'We are inviting everyone to participate to show support that this is a region of hope, peace and renewal.' Arrests: From left, Wonzey Saffold, James Davis, and Bruce Wimbush Jr face assault with intent to murder charges . Hero: Deborah Hughes helped save Steve Utash's life when she stepped between him and his attackers . Mr Utash, a tree trimmer, suffered severe head injuries when at least six people beat and kicked him when he stopped his truck to help 10-year-old David Harris on Detroit's east side. Deborah Hughes, a nurse who lives in the neighborhood, rushed to help the boy and stopped the mob from continuing to beat Mr Utash, police said. He remains in hospital, where he was listed earlier this week as being in a critical condition and in a medically induced coma. David Harris, the boy he ran into, was treated for a leg and other injuries. Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' a Detroit police spokesman told Mail Online earlier this week.

Utash did the right thing by stopping to help a child in need and, . appallingly, was punished for doing so,' state representative Brian Banks said. 'People should not be punished for doing the right thing.' Worthy said she 'would not be surprised' if police submitted more warrant requests stemming from the attack. 'This case is still under investigation,' she said. 'We are still looking at every avenue and every aspect. We know that there were a number of people involved in this case.'

"By . Associated Press . A small Southern California town has turned up the heat on the makers of the wildly popular Sriracha hot sauce, telling them that if they can't keep their bottling plant from smelling up the neighborhood, the city will. The Irwindale City Council voted 4-0 Wednesday to tentatively declare Huy Fong's 2-year-old bottling plant a public nuisance. If a second vote, scheduled for April 23, makes the declaration official, Huy Fong will have 90 days to stop releasing the spicy smells that neighbors say burn their eyes and throats and make them sneeze and cough. If the smells still persist, the Los Angeles suburb says it will have the authority to enter the plant, take whatever measures are necessary to kill the odor, and bill the company for its efforts. Scroll down for video . FILE - In the Oct. 29, 2013 file photo, Sriracha chili sauce is produced at the Huy Fong Foods factory in Irwindale, Calif. The Irwindale City Council declared Wednesday, April 9, 2014, that the factory that produces the popular Sriracha hot sauce is a public nuisance. The action on Wednesday gives the factory 90 days to make changes to stop the spicy odors that prompted complaints from some residents last fall. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File) Reaction to the move was swift and heated. State Sen. Ed Hernandez, who represents the area, advised Irwindale to cool it, saying if the city of 1,400 residents doesn't want the maker of arguably the world's most popular hot sauce, he's sure there are several other cities in his district that do. 'I ask that the city of Irwindale reject this inflammatory and unnecessary public nuisance designation and work constructively with Huy Fong Foods to resolve these issues,' he said in a statement. The company's attorney, John Tate, complained the vote was akin to 'thumbing Huy Fong in the eye,' since it came after he told the city that Huy Fong was working with regional air-quality officials on a plan to make the smell go away by June 1. Irwindale City Manager John Davidson said officials were delighted to hear that, indicating he's certain everybody will simmer down once they realize the city wants only the smell, and not the company, to go away. 'Obviously this is a council that wants to work with all local businesses regardless of their size, and has never had any interest in having Huy Fong Foods shut down or relocating,' he said. Davidson said city officials plan to work with the company and air-quality officials to ensure Huy Fong can get a filtration system in place that will make everyone happy. The company opened its $40 million bottling plant in Irwindale after it outgrew its old one in nearby Rosemead. The city says most of the complaints about pungent, spicy smells have come during the last two harvest seasons when as many as 100 million pounds of freshly harvested, red-hot jalapeno peppers were ground between August and October. Davidson said 30 to 35 people have given the city sworn statements that the smell bothers them. A couple told city officials the smell made them ill enough that they saw their doctors. Privately held Huy Fong Foods was founded and is still owned by Vietnamese immigrant David Tran. He began making the fiery sauce in a bucket at his home in 1980 and saw his business take off from there. Originally a staple in Asian restaurants and homes, Huy Fong's Sriracha sauce, in its distinctive green-tipped bottles with the rooster on the logo, has spread across all cultures, with people putting it on their hot dogs, tacos, pizza and other foods.","Irwindale, California city council will vote again April 23 on whether to officially give the Huy Fong 90 days to stop releasing tear-jerking smells .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 02:43 EST, 7 November 2011 . A handful of states - led by those that enjoy bountiful energy reserves such as West Virginia, Wyoming and North Dakota - have found themselves in enviable positions and oases of optimism at a time of tepid economic recovery. In an otherwise barren landscape of budget cuts and government layoffs, the questions that sent Alaska lawmakers into special session this year had nothing to do with austerity measures or disagreements over cuts to state agencies or programs. They just couldn't agree on what to do with all that extra money. The resource-rich state took in nearly $1.9billion more than expected last fiscal year thanks largely to high oil prices and ended the fiscal year with an estimated $260million surplus, an amount equal to nearly four per cent of its general fund. Meanwhile, a few other states, including Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia, have combined slight increases in tax revenue with tight spending controls to produce more modest surpluses. Resource rich: An oil pipeline pictured in Alaska, where some of the $1.9billion in revenue last fiscal year is attributed to rising oil prices . In West Virginia, the surplus is going . toward reserves, pension programs and debt. Wyoming put much of the . extra money into savings after years of investing heavily in roads and . schools. And in North Dakota, which is . experiencing an energy boom similar to the one Wyoming went through . several years ago, investments included an extra $370million for road . repair and construction, especially in the oil-producing western part of . the state. Some $340million will go to schools over the next two years . to help reduce property taxes, while $22million will go toward a . disaster relief fund for a state that has been inundated with floods in . recent years. At the same time they are saving and . investing, North Dakota and West Virginia are reducing their corporate . income tax rates, a move that could make them even more attractive to . certain businesses. Unemployment in many of the states . running surpluses has been well below the national jobless rate of 9.1 . per cent. North Dakota's rate, for example, was 3.5 per cent in . September. Alaska labour department economist . Neal Fried said: 'I don't think you can say we're out of the woods. We . were never in the woods.' Data: Maps from the National Association of State Budget Officers show states' changing balance levels between 2008 and 2012 . A yearlong review of fiscal and . economic data in all 50 states by The Associated Press found 15 states . with budget surpluses as they headed into the current fiscal year. They . ranged from Mississippi, where the $6.6million surplus represented less . than one percent of general fund spending, to Wyoming, where the . $437million surplus was equivalent to 28 percent of the state's general . fund. Massachusetts has benefited from . stronger-than-anticipated revenue from capital gains taxes to build a . surplus of just more than one per cent of its general fund budget. It used . nearly three-quarters of the $460 million surplus to replenish the . state's reserve fund, while directing other surplus money to cities and . towns recovering from deadly tornadoes in June, state courts and to . provide modest raises to social service workers. Most states have not been so fortunate. They continue to feel the effects of a . recession that has led to steep declines in state and local tax . revenue, with 23 states having to make budget cuts during the last . fiscal year, according to the National Association of State Budget . Officers. In Washington state, for example, the . Legislature is preparing for a special session to address a $2billion, . mid-year deficit. The state's Democratic governor has proposed . eliminating the state's health care program for the poor and a medical . program for disabled adults. Lower than expected tax revenue in . California means that state is likely headed for deeper cuts to social . services and higher education. Ups and downs: A graph released by the National Association of State Budget Officers shows cuts made after the budget passed between 1990 and fiscal 2011 . Even in Alaska, officials are . grappling with how to reverse a decades-long trend of declining oil . production and face a future of reduced federal aid as Congress seeks to . clamp down on spending, rising Medicaid costs and $11billion in . unfunded pension liabilities. Governor Sean Parnell acknowledged this in . making record cuts to an infrastructure spending bill passed by . lawmakers last spring. Yet even with those reductions, the . state wound up with a $2.8billion public works package, the same as the . year before — a spending level Parnell deemed 'healthy'. Among the state's priorities is . investing in new roads, schools and energy projects that could help make . the delivery of heat, electricity and fuel more reliable and . affordable. Alaska also is putting $66million . toward pursuing what would be the largest dam built in the U.S. in . decades. Officials say the $4.5billion, 700ft high Susitna River dam . would help meet Alaska's goal of getting half its electricity from . renewable energy sources by 2025, plus help meet the energy demands of . the state's most populous region. The state also plans to spend money on . transportation projects and upgrades to school buildings, including . contributing about one-third the cost of a $109million arena at the . University of Alaska Anchorage. At the same time, Alaska is building the . nation's largest rainy day fund at $14billion, an amount that is . roughly double the state's entire general fund. Energy producing: A railroad leading towards America's largest geothermal power plant in Wyodak, Wyoming . An enviable state: An electrician burrows down to adjust a group of plastic pipes as part of a $64million expansion and renovation project at the North Dakota State Penitentiary. The state is also in the black . The governor and legislative leaders also have set aside $400million that could serve as an endowment for college scholarships. Juneau resident Teddy Castillo said . such a program would be a huge help to her family. One daughter will . graduate high school next year and another is a high school freshman. 'I think it's just awesome to have that opportunity available for them,' Mr Castillo said. In West Virginia, the worldwide demand . for coal and a conservative approach to government spending have kept . the state's finances in the black. Instead of expanding programs, . lawmakers and governors have devoted about $1billion that was left . unspent between 2004 and 2008 toward public pension programs and other . debts. Most of that money eased a shortfall in the main retirement fund . for teachers. But one consequence of the state's . tight-fisted approach has been government on the cheap: West Virginia . ranks low for teacher and public employee wages despite several rounds . of pay raises and has among the most restrictive eligibility . requirements for Medicaid. Perry Bryant, executive director of . West Virginians For Affordable Health Care, said: 'If you're a mom with . two children and you earn more than $6,500 a year, you're not eligible. If you're childless, you don't qualify even if you're penniless.' In Wyoming, which gets most of its . money from taxes on gas, coal and oil production, investments this year . included $45million in additional highway money and $15million to try to . attract large computing centers to the state. The state also has a . scholarship fund for high school students, similar to what Alaska is . establishing. Republican state Senator Phil Nicholas . doesn't take Wyoming's energy wealth for granted. He remembers seeing . how the state went from facing a $500million shortfall in the late 1990s . to being flush with cash thanks to the energy boom that started about . ten years ago. While energy production generates more tax revenue, it also can lead to higher ozone levels and other negative consequences. Mr Nicholas, who is chairman of the . Senate Appropriations Committee, added: 'Recognizing that price, though, . Wyoming and our communities are significantly dressed up, if you will.' He said every town in the state has nicer schools, better parks and other amenities than existed before. 'You'd be hard-pressed to go to any community in this state that has not benefited significantly,' he said.","Alaska took in nearly $1.9billion more than expected last fiscal year .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . The girlfriend of a security guard has been found guilty of helping him steal boots from the Premier League club where he worked - so that he could use them play Sunday league football. Tanya Cotton, 24, stole Nike footwear worth £200 belonging to Scottish midfielder Graham Dorrans from West Bromwich Albion’s training ground on August 29 last year. Her boyfriend, Aaron Hinds, admitted taking kit from the Premier League star as well as trainers owned by player James Morrison, 27, when he pleaded guilty to two charges of theft and one of burglary last November. Couple Tanya Cotton and Aaron Hinds stole football boots from the changing rooms at West Bromwich Albion's training ground . The 25-year-old was handed a 12 month community order with 200 hours unpaid work at Walsall Magistrates Court. His girlfriend, Cotton, pleaded not guilty to the theft at the time but was found guilty at the same court yesterday. The court heard that the Premier League club decided to install CCTV cameras because items kept going missing from the training ground in Great Barr, Birmingham. Hinds was then caught on camera selecting boots before passing them to Cotton who put them down her leggings and pulled her jumper over the top. After realising that the boots were not well hidden enough, Cotton handed the shoes to her boyfriend and helped him conceal them before the pair left the room. The pair stole boots with a value of £200 belonging to Graham Dorrans (right) from a changing room at West Bromwich Albion's training ground . The Nike boots (not those pictured) were taken by Hines and Cotton while Hines was working as a security guard at the club . The court heard that Cotton, of Birmingham, had been 'stupid' because she had believed Hinds when he told her that he was allowed to borrow the boots. Prosecutor Mark Rees told the Justice of the Peace (JP): 'The defendant was in the boot room with her boyfriend Mr Hines. 'Because there had been items going missing from the training ground CCTV cameras were installed which show Hines selecting boots and passing them to Miss Cotton. The boots which belongs to Graham Dorrans (left) were stolen at the West Bromwich Albion training ground. Cotton said she believed Aaron Hinds had permission to borrow the boots . 'She then stuffs them down her leggings and pulls her jumper over the top. 'After realising the boots are not concealed, she hands them to Hines and helps him conceal them and the two then leave the room. 'The defendant was interviewed and insisted she had not taken anything from the ground, which is true, but she helped her partner to take them.' Cotton said: 'Aaron said he was allowed to borrow the boots and I believed him because I have known him for five years and I've been his girlfriend for two years' Giving evidence, Cotton said Hinds had told her he intended to borrow the boots before concealing them inside his jacket. She added: 'Aaron said he was allowed to borrow the boots and I believed him because I have known him for five years and I’ve been his girlfriend for two years. 'He asked me to hold a pair of boots . and told me to put them down leggings which I did but then I took them . out and handed them back to him. 'I . am aware of how it looks on the footage but at the time I did not . question him because I trust him. I had no intention of stealing . anything.' Cotton was found guilty of theft at Walsall Magistrates Court and will be sentenced on Monday. Chairman of the bench Richard . Dewis said: 'The video footage did not make it clear that Miss Cotton . did not want to steal the boots. 'She was a willing accomplice and we find her guilty as charged.' At . a hearing at the same court in November, Hines admitted taking the . boots belonging to midfielder Dorrans, 26, as well as trainers owned by . star player James Morrison, 27. He was caught on CCTV taking keys to the ground’s laundry room where he also stole one of the club’s t-shirts in a clear bag. JPs were told Hinds planned to use the kit to play football - because he could not afford to buy his own.

They were a perfect fit,' said her mother Kim Blake . Mrs Blake, who volunteers as a Cub Scout leader, said: 'We brought her home in time for her brother Jason’s birthday. I’d ordered clothes for Janey from the internet, but when they arrived they were obviously far too large to fit her. 'Our daughter Jodie had the idea of dressing her in a pair of pink leggings she had taken from one of her dolls. They were a perfect fit. 'Janey actually had ‘Baby Born’ written on her bum for a little while.' Janey in intensive care shortly after she was born. For reason still unknown, the placenta feeding Janey in the womb had failed to form properly, blocking vital nutrients and oxygen . Mrs Blake, of Watford, was shocked when she was told by doctors at a 28 week scan that they wanted to deliver Janey immediately by emergency Cesarean section . Mrs Blake, of Watford, was shocked when she was told by doctors at a 28 week scan that they wanted to deliver Janey immediately by emergency Cesarean section. She said: 'They said there was a problem with the blood supply through the umbilical chord and they wanted to deliver her straight away. 'They informed me that the delivery unit was ready to receive me. I panicked - I didn’t think she had the slightest chance of surviving. At the time she weighed just 450 grams.' Mrs Blake and her husband Steve, 37, a Royal Mail worker, were taken to the special care baby unit at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. Janey was smaller than many dolls when she was born premature at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge . Kim and Steve Blake with Janey shortly after she was born. The couple were  warned that if she wasn't breathing when she arrived, doctors wouldn't attempt to resuscitate her . Janey's parents visit her in hospital along with her brother Jason and her sister Jodie . The delivery was postponed at the last minute by a senior consultant who wanted to carry out tests to see whether Janey would survive outside the womb. Mrs Blake would stay on the ward for another 10 days, during which time she was encouraged to prepare for the reality of caring for a premature baby. She said: 'The midwives suggested we visited the neonatal area, where we were lucky to meet a new mum and the premature baby she was caring for. It was a very useful experience to see what a premature baby looks like in real life. 'It reduced the shock and the fear of the unknown. 'Still, it was a very nervous wait. A consultant told us he expected Janey to have less than one per cent chance of survival and we were warned that if she wasn’t breathing when she arrived, they wouldn’t attempt to resuscitate her. 'I asked them to give her one go - in case she just needed a kickstart to get going.' To Mr and Mrs Blake’s relief, Janey cried at the delivery before she was immediately taken to an incubator. The midwives informed them the placenta had been rock-hard and so small it could have fitted into half a disposable cup. Mrs Blake advised other parents caring for premature babies to treat their children as individual cases and avoid the temptation to compare the progress of their children with others . 'We were told Janey might miss some developmental milestones, but she's rushed ahead. She started walking at a young age than her younger sister,' said her mother . The cause of the placenta malformation remains a mystery. Janey had her first meal - one drop of milk - at five days old. She fought off a serious infection seven days after her birthday and required four blood transfusions before she was strong enough to return home to her brother Jason, now 11, and sister Jodie, 10. Mrs Blake said: 'The children had seen a photograph of Janey shortly after she was born and Jason’s reaction was to ask if she was alive. 'He came to visit Janey while she was still in hospital and the nurse asked what he wanted for his upcoming birthday. He said he wanted his sister to come home. She arrived home just in time for the party. 'We were struggling to find something for Jodie to wear because her legs were still so small. That’s when Jodie walked in holding her doll’s leggings and said, ‘what about these?’. 'We were told Janey might miss some developmental milestones, but she’s rushed ahead. She started walking at a young age than her younger sister.' Janey started nursery school last year and in September this year she will enter primary school reception class. Mrs Blake said: 'At first we had problems finding her a uniform for nursery - we were still buying trousers from Mothercare and she wore a vest meant for nine to 12 month old children. 'But since Christmas she’s really hit a growth spurt. She’s not too far away from her classmates in height - she’s not the shortest any more - but she’s still very skinny, so we carefully monitor her diet and general health. 'She’s a very caring girl who loves animals. She’s very cheeky and bossy - she’s definitely in charge of the older two and comes across as being older than she is.' Mrs Blake advised other parents caring for premature babies to treat their children as individual cases and avoid the temptation to compare the progress of their children with others. She said: We are in touch with parents whose children were in a similar situation to Janey’s. Janey spent longer in the incubator than many of them, but is doing better than them in many ways now. 'Remember that every child is individual.'","Janey had less than one per cent chance of survival when she was born .

"By . Alan Roden . Alex Salmond is under pressure to deliver the ‘speech of his life’ tomorrow as new opinion polls reveal that his independence campaign is faltering. The First Minister is in Aberdeen for the SNP’s final conference before September’s referendum, where supporters will be bitterly disappointed that movement towards a Yes vote has stalled. A Survation poll has handed the pro-Union Better Together campaign a comfortable ten-point lead, with backing for independence down two points since last month to just 37 per cent. Pressure: First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured at the SNP conference today, has seen mounting criticism of his plans for independence, amid fears of a run on the banks . Support for a No vote held steady on 47 . per cent, with the findings suggesting that growing numbers of women are . opposed to leaving the UK. A separate study for Panelbase, which is the SNP’s favourite pollster as it consistently shows strong backing for separation, puts the Yes vote on 40 per cent – down one point since a poll published at the weekend. The No vote slipped by one point to 45 per cent. Panelbase also found that even if Scots accept Nationalist claims that their family would be better off – which most studies show is improbable – only slightly over half of adults would vote Yes. Ahead of Mr Salmond’s keynote speech tomorrow, his deputy Nicola Sturgeon used the conference platform today to make a desperate appeal to Labour voters to back the break-up of Britain. Around 800,000 traditional Labour voters in the central belt are thought to be key to the referendum result, and Miss Sturgeon claimed that a Yes vote could ‘rejuvenate’ her party’s main rivals. Her audacious appeal comes as Scotland’s leading elections expert, Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, said the latest polling results give pro-independence campaign leaders a reason to ‘pause for thought’. ‘The No side’s recent apparent nervousness should be steadied a little,’ he said. A new poll by Survation gives the No campaign a 10-point lead . Banks face being forced to abandon an independent Scotland or risk losing nearly £300billion from English customers, figures show. Two-fifths of clients from other parts of the UK would pull their money out of Scottish institutions if there is a Yes vote and no deal is struck to share the pound, according to a poll. Currency exchange firm UKForex, which commissioned the YouGov survey, estimated Scottish banks would lose £280billion if they did not move south of the Border after independence. Such a loss of business would be devastating, cutting their balance sheets by more than a third. It is the latest economic blow to Alex Salmond's separation bid, which has seen finan-cial bodies queue up to raise concerns. Business Secretary Vince Cable has already warned that RBS would abandon its Edinburgh HQ and move to London after separation, a move that would result in the loss of 3,200 jobs north of the Border. Of 1,622 non-Scots quizzed for UKForex, 42 per cent said they would be 'more likely' to move to an English bank, with 5 per cent saying they would be 'less likely' and 40 per cent saying it would make no difference. Twice as many thought they would be worse off if Scotland voted for independence than predicted a boost - 16 per cent compared to eight, while 56 per cent thought it would make no difference. ‘In themselves the changes are statistically insignificant. However, this [Survation poll] is the second poll in a row to show that the winter’s increase in Yes support may have come to a halt now that spring finally seems to be with us. ‘That is not the impression the Yes side would like to see created. They would prefer to see their support increase month on month – a movement with apparent sufficient momentum to take them past the winning post by September. They must fear that while the winter’s gains may have been consolidated, their further progress is now stalled.’ Professor Curtice added: ‘The SNP gather in Aberdeen this weekend for their spring conference. Activists will be hoping that Mr Salmond gives the speech of his life. It is certainly not an opportunity he can afford to waste.’ Survation sampled 1,002 people aged 16 and over in Scotland from April 4-to-7. Results have been compared with a previous Survation poll between March 6 and 7. The findings show that support for separation among women has fallen by 4 points since the last survey, dropping from 32.5 per cent to just 28.5 per cent. Panelbase sampled 1,024 people aged 16 and over from April 4-to-9, and results were compared with a previous Panelbase poll in March. Better Together leader Alistair Darling said: ‘It's no surprise that Scots are rejecting Alex Salmond's negative and divisive campaign when he won't tell us what would replace the pound or how our essential public services, like schools and hospitals, would be funded. ‘There can be no complacency from those of us who want Scotland to remain in the UK. We will do everything we can to convince those who have yet to make up their mind that we are stronger and better together as part of the UK.’ But Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘These are extremely encouraging findings, which show that the referendum is wide open. ‘On these new (Panelbase) figures, Yes just needs a three-point swing to move ahead - and we are very confident of achieving success in September.’ Miss Sturgeon will say today: ‘To every Labour voter in the country, I say this: the Yes campaign is not asking you to leave your party. Instead it offers you the chance to get your party back. ‘An independent Scotland will not mean the end of Labour, but might mean a rejuvenated Labour – a Labour Party free to make its own decisions, a Labour Party that no longer needs to dance a Westminster tune. ‘For everyone out there with Labour in your heart, the message is clear – don’t vote No to stop the SNP, vote Yes to reclaim the Labour Party.’ Nicola Sturgeon, Deputy First Minister, issued a plea to Labour voters to back independence at the SNP Spring Conference in Aberdeen . Miss Sturgeon also announced an extra £1million for foodbanks in Scotland as she courts the left-wing vote. Despite the slump in support for separation, SNP activists will be delighted with the party political polling results in the Survation study. The Nationalists are on 44.9 per cent in the constituency vote for the next Holyrood election, with Labour trailing on 32.1 per cent – down nearly two points since March. The Tories are up 0.5 percentage points to 13.5 per cent, with the LibDems on 5.7 per cent. SNP business convener Derek Mackay said: ‘The fall in Labour support will undoubtedly set alarm bells ringing there, and raise further questions about Johann Lamont's leadership.’ But Drew Smith, Labour's constitutional spokesman, said: ’This is both desperate and dishonest from Nicola Sturgeon who will clearly say anything to persuade people to vote to break up the United Kingdom. ‘Nicola Sturgeon has been campaigning against Labour all her political life, in good times, and in bad times, and when we were lifting children and pensioners out of poverty, she still argued for nationalism. ‘The Scottish Labour Party works in partnership with people all over the UK and beyond who share our values of fairness and equality and we reject Nicola Sturgeon's narrow politics of division and grievance. ‘Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon would be better concentrating her campaigning efforts on the one in three SNP voters who don't believe in separation.’","Rallying cry from SNP leader as Yes vote slides in the polls again .

"By . Julian Robinson . They are the police mugshots that show the changing face of a mother-of-three as she racked up 50 convictions in just 13 years. Sinead Shaw began her life of crime when she was only 12, targeting the elderly and infirm for money. Police photographs of the 25-year-old, taken on three separate occasions since she was 18, show her putting on the same look before being sent to court to face trial. Sinead Shaw, pictured left in 2014, ahead of facing jail for stealing from a 70-year-old stroke victim. And, right, as an 18-year-old in 2007 when police released her image when she failed to turn up to court to face theft and deception charges . Now the unemployed single mother, from . Nelson in Lancashire is behind bars once again – as she begins a four . and a half year sentence for stealing from a 70-year-old stroke victim . as he lay in bed. At Burnley Crown Court, the judge Mr Recorder Anthony Cross, QC, told Shaw who admitted burglary: ‘You worm your way into the life of an elderly person, gain their trust and then abuse that trust. ‘I have formed the very clear view that it’s necessary to protect elderly people from you for a significant period of time. ‘I would be failing in my duty were I not to do so. Those who are most vulnerable in our society, the elderly and the infirm, must have the greatest protection of the courts.’ Earlier the court heard how Shaw had more than 50 offences on her criminal record starting in 2001 when she burgled sheltered accommodation for the elderly and took a purse. She had amassed 20 convictions by the time she was only 16. Three years later she developed a drug habit and went on a burglary spree with her then heroin addicted boyfriend. Sinead Shaw is pictured in 2013 with a the same expression on her face. On this occasion, she sent back to court after stealing £500 from a 79-year-old woman suffering from dementia. She had offered to help her with errands but stole her bank card instead and was jailed for 20 weeks, but then freed due to time she spent on remand . In August 2011 she was seven months pregnant with her second child when she was given a community order after being caught with a wheel bin stuffed with stolen household goods from an old folk’s home. Later in September 2013 Shaw was back in court after stealing £500 from a 79-year-old woman suffering from dementia. She had offered to help her with errands but stole her bank card instead. She was jailed for 20 weeks but freed due to time she spent on remand. The latest theft occurred just two months later after the 70-year old victim had been left incapacitated on his right side by up to three strokes and was suffering reduced dexterity in his right arm and hand. The court heard as a result of the strokes, the victim struggled to speak, walked with a stick and had carers to help with this daily living such as bathing and cooking and supervise his medication. He spent most of the day lying on his bed inside the ground floor flat in a terrace row and kept his door open because of his mobility issues and to allow the carers to come in and out. But Emma Kehoe prosecuting said Shaw and her friends would regularly hang around outside the victim’s house and often went into the flat to drink alcohol and chat. Mrs Kehoe said: 'The victim, on many occasions, was content for them to do this. He’s a lonely man and at times, enjoys the company.' But the man contacted police and said a sock containing money he was saving had been stolen. The pensioner became very concerned about Shaw and her friends being in the flat and she was no longer welcome. But last November 12, she turned up at his home and when the victim told her to go away, she put her hand down his trousers. Mrs Kehoe added : 'She was looking for money but because she didn’t find any, she unzipped the pocket of his track suit bottoms and removed £20. She was talking to him about her children as she did this. When he saw she had taken the money, he shouted at her again.' Burnley Crown Court, where Sinead Shaw, of Nelson, Lancashire, was jailed for more than four years. The court heard how she had committed 50 offences in 13 years . The prosecutor said the victim grabbed Shaw’s hood and called her a thief, but she broke free and left. When his carer arrived soon after, he found the pensioner walking out of his bedroom, breathing heavily and shaking and knew immediately something was wrong. The 70-year-old told him what had happened and the carer called the police. Shaw later denied being in the man’s home and claimed he was unreliable because he was a 'heavy drinker.' She then alleged she had taken the victim’s money for payment for “sexual favours” that she had given him. In mitigation defence counsel James Heyworth said Shaw was now on methadone and added: 'She appreciates the impact this offence has had. Heroin addiction is like no other addiction known to man. 'Those who are addicted to heroin show the least victim empathy at the time of the offence and they will do anything they can to satisfy their need for that drug.' Mr Heyworth also read a letter of apology to the court from Shaw which said: 'I so badly want to wake up in the mornings happy and not worry where I am going to get my drugs from. 'I’m not a bad person and I know that it was wrong. I am sorry from the bottom of my heart.'","Mother-of-three Sinead Shaw has racked up 50 convictions in 13 years .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Antique watches worth more than £200,000 which date back to the 17th century have been stolen in an evening raid. The haul of 16 watches were taken from a house in Beckenham, south east London, along with a BMW car. The car was founded dumped in south London two days later, but there was no sign of the watches. These two watches alone are said to be worth £27,000. Left, is the Reeve timepiece dating back to 1630 and valued at approximately £15,000. Right, is a De St Leu, valued at approximately £12,000 from 1765 . These are two Breguet watches, with the one on the left worth £15,000 and the one on the right valued at £10,000 . Another set of Breguet watches, which were taken. The watch on the left is worth £15,000, while the one on the right is valued at £12,000 . The timepieces include a number of French and English watches made by the 'highest end watchmakers out there'. It also includes a Reeve timepiece, which dates back to 1630, and is worth around £15,000 alone. Simon Kerby, an antiques watch specialist from the Gerald E. Marsh dealership in Hampshire said: 'This was obviously a very good collection. 'A lot of the watches are classic English and French makers who are also famous clock makers. These are the highest end watchmakers out there. 'The list includes many of the top names. Breguet is going to be up there as one of the best. Among the watches taken in the haul was this Fromanteel timepiece from 1690, which is valued at £6,000 . A Quare & Horseman watch, from 1705, worth £7,500 and this K. J Everell, valued at £5,000  from 1705 were also taken in the raid . Together these two watch, a Lampe timepiece, left, and a Lupton watch, right, are worth a total of £16,500. They were both included in the haul taken from the house in Beckenham, south London . 'They would have been making watches since the 1700s, and some of their pieces are astonishing.” He added: “It would be difficult to sell them as a single lot in auction. 'They could possibly be sold abroad. The pocket watch collecting community is very small, there are really very few people who collect them. 'If someone came in here with a collection like that we would really want to know when they were last sold. 'I would also want to know when and how they were acquired. It would be very likely they had come up in an auction like Christie’s or Sotheby’s. 'You would have to be very careful where you sell them if you didn’t want to alert suspicion.' The Windmill, left from 1720, valued at approximately £6,500 while this Boucheret timepiece also from the 1700s is said to be worth £6,000 . This timepiece from Tompion dates back to 1710 and is said to be worth £5,000 . The Metropolitan Police confirmed that watches had been stolen. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A burglary was committed at a property in Beckenham, on Tuesday, March 4 between 5.45pm and 10.10pm during which in excess of 16 antique watches were stolen, along with a BMW. 'The car was subsequently recovered in Verney Road, Southwark on March 6.' Mr Kerby added: 'As an antique watch collector myself, security is a concern.' 'It’s something you do have to be very wary.'","More than 16 watches taken from a house in Beckenham, south east London .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, who his a £1bn trove of suspected stolen Nazi art in his Munich flat it to be given some of the art back . A German recluse accused of hording £1billion worth of art thought to be stolen by the Nazis is to get some paintings back, a court has ruled. Thousands of works by masters such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Otto Dix were discovered in the house of 81-year-old Cornelius Gurlitt in 2012 during a small-scale tax investigation. Gurlitt has now agreed to return any work which investigators can prove was stolen, but if there is no evidence of theft after a year then the paintings will be released to him. Of the 1,401 works found at his Munich home, roughly 500 are currently in doubt. Gurlitt's spokesman said he expects to get between 300 and 350 works back. Gurlitt inherited the collection from his father, Hildebrand, who took orders from Adolf Hitler to buy and sell so-called 'degenerate' and Jewish art to fund the party's activities during the 30s and 40s. German prosecutors seized the art trove in February 2012 as part of a tax investigation after Gurlitt aroused the suspicion of German customs officials who stopped him on a train from Switzerland carrying a large sum of cash. The collection, which includes works by Picasso, Matisse and Dix was discovered inside his Munich apartment . Under a new deal with prosecutors, art historians will have a year to examine the 1,401 works to establish where they came from and if they were stolen (pictured, a work by Otto Dix) Under the terms of the new deal, the art will be held at a secret location for a year while historians carry out background checks on each of the paintings. After the year is up any painting they cannot prove is stolen, or any painting which they have not finished studying, will be returned to Gurlitt. Augsburg state prosecutor Matthias Nickolai said: 'We have come across new evidence in the course of the investigation ... that leads us to re-evaluate the legal situation.' If investigators can prove a work was stolen then Gurlitt has agreed to return it to the rightful owners (pictured, one painting in the collection by Henri Matisse) However if after a year the historians can't prove the work was stolen, or if they haven't finished their research, Gurlitt will receive the painting back. His spokesman today said he expected to keep between 300 and 350 of the pictures . Gurlitt's lawyer Tido Park applauded the decision to release the art, saying: 'It's a good day for Cornelius Gurlitt.' The German government has come under fire - especially by families whose relatives were robbed by the Nazis - for keeping silent for almost two years about the trove of art works. Gurlitt was arrested in 2012 but it wasn't until last year that knowledge of the collection became public.","1,401 paintings discovered in 2012 in apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt .

"By . Dan Bloom . A bomb has ripped through a market in Pakistan killing at least 21 people in the deadliest attack on the nation's capital in several years. Officials said the device was hidden inside a box of guava fruit when it triggered the huge blast this morning, tearing traders' bodies apart and sending their limbs flying through the air. The Taliban denied responsibility, blaming the blast on 'hidden hands', as negotiations continued with Pakistan's authorities to end fighting that has killed tens of thousands in the north west. Scroll down for video . Horror: A Pakistani boy mourns over the death of a family member outside a morgue in Islamabad today. A 5kg device hidden inside a crate of guava fruit killed at least 21 people in the deadliest attack on the city in years . Checks: Armed police cordoned off the market and used metal detectors to scan several more containers . Deaths: The body of one of the victims is carried in a casket from the morgue in Islamabad . Blast: Residents transport the lifeless body of their relative, whose feet are visible from under a white sheet . Mourning: Relatives receive news outside a hospital. The bomb went off even as negotiations continued . Police said around 5kg of explosives were hidden in the fruit carton and exploded as morning shoppers were buying supplies at the market, on the outskirts of Islamabad. The power of the blast sent cartons of fruit and vegetables flying and left the ground littered with blood-stained sandals, guavas and prayer caps. Around 70 other people were injured. One trader, who gave his name only as Shaheen, said: 'Body parts went everywhere and even hit other people on the head.' Another, Afzal Khan, said: 'People were dying. People were crying. People were running.' Abdul Jalil, searching frantically for his brother whose phone was not ringing, said: 'The people . were torn apart. Their body parts scattered. 'Who are these people . killing innocent people? What do they get out of it? God will not . forgive them.' Abdul Jalil, searching frantically for his brother whose phone was not ringing, said: 'The people were torn apart. Their body parts scattered... Who are these people killing innocent people? What do they get out of it?' The Pakistani Taliban denied responsibility, claiming the attack was 'wrong and against Islamic law' Careful: A police official uses a metal detector to search the site of the bomb blast for more devices . Although large bombings are frequent in north western Pakistani cities, they are relatively rare in the capital . The Pakistani Taliban denied responsibility and condemned the attack. 'The deaths of innocent people in attacks on public places are saddening,' the group's spokesman, Shahidullah Shahid, said in a statement. 'Such attacks are wrong and against Islamic law.' The Taliban regularly bomb schools, marketplaces and public transport. Authorities say they have killed tens of thousands of Pakistanis. The organisation is in talks with the government, where it has demanded the release of hundreds of prisoners and the withdrawal of the army from regions on the border with Afghanistan. But there are concerns any peace deal with the Tehrik-e-Taliban - the formal name for the group in Pakistan - would be impossible to enforce because it has so many splinter groups and factions. Observers also say the Taliban have used previous peace deals to regroup and replenish their forces for a later fight. Anger: Men stand in front of the casket of their relative as they wait for an ambulance outside hospital . Tears: A man in mourning. One trader said 'body parts went everywhere and even hit other people on the head' Inconsolable: The bombing is a blow to the government's attempts to portray the capital as more secure . Nineteen of the dead today were taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad, said an emergency room doctor, Zulfikar Ghauri. He said the hospital was also treating 56 people who were wounded in the bombing. Two bodies and 31 wounded were taken to Holy Family Hospital in the nearby city of Rawalpindi, said doctor Tahir Sharif. Standing guard: Armed police at the bomb site . The market is near a makeshift camp for people displaced from fighting in Pakistan's northwest, as well as refugees from Afghanistan. It is also next to a supermarket which caters for the capital's middle class families. Although large bombings are frequent in north western Pakistani cities, they are relatively rare in the capital, which is home to diplomats, generals and top government officials. The symbolism of such a deadly attack in Islamabad, even in an area rarely frequented by its elite, is a blow to a Pakistani government trying to increase foreign investment. Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, a lawmaker . from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-N party, said it was difficult to . say which group was behind the explosion until police complete their . investigation. Asked what the intended target was, he said: 'I think peace in Pakistan is the target.' Prime . Minister Nawaz Sharif came to power last May promising to end the years . of bloodshed through negotiation instead of military operations. Government . negotiators held direct talks with the Taliban on March 26 at an . undisclosed location in the tribal areas, and on Saturday the government . announced that Pakistan would release 13 Taliban prisoners to . facilitate the talks. The militants had also declared a temporary ceasefire until tomorrow. Shock: A relative at the hospital. Critics say peace is not guaranteed because the Taliban has many factions . United in grief: There are fears a peace deal would not be adhered to by all factions of the Taliban .

"By . Dan Bloom . The U.S. government spied on major human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the whistleblower Edward Snowden has claimed. He told Europe's largest human rights watchdog that the National Security Agency had 'specifically targeted either leaders or staff members' in a large number of groups. Mr Snowden's evidence - via video link from Moscow, where he has been in hiding since last year - came as he mocked claims he had taken 1.7million documents as a 'scare number' with no meaning. Allegations: Edward Snowden appeared before the Council of Europe via video link from Moscow . Mr Snowden said 'trillions' of private communications were monitored, including those of human rights groups . The NSA whistleblower spoke for more than an hour to the Council of Europe, a human rights group with 47 member states. He defended his decision to leak thousands of documents, saying: 'My motivation is to improve government, not to bring it down.' Despite the changes which had been made because of his revelations, he said: 'I remain in a position of significant legal jeaopardy'. He was then asked if the U.S. had tracked 'highly sensitive and confidential communications' of groups including - but not limited to - Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. He told council members: 'Without question - yes, absolutely they do. 'The NSA has in fact specifically targeted the communications of either leaders or staff members in a number of purely civil or human rights organisations of the kind described in the question, including domestically within the borders of the United States.' In an interview before the hearing, the whistleblower - whose first claims emerged in June last year - said U.S. officials were exaggerating when they said he stole 1.7million documents. Hearing: The hour-long session was a rare public appearance for Mr Snowden, who is hiding in Moscow . Interview: Mr Snowden's evidence - via video link from Moscow, where he has been in hiding for almost a year - came as he mocked claims he had taken 1.7million documents as a 'scare number' with no meaning . Watchdog: The Council of Europe is a separate body from the EU and includes 47 member states . He told Vanity Fair magazine it was 'simply a scare number based on an intentionally crude metric - everything that I ever digitally interacted with in my career.' He added: 'Every single one of those officials knows I don’t have 1.7million files, but what are they going to say? 'What senior official is going to go in front of Congress and say, ""We have no idea what he has, because the N.S.A.’s auditing of systems holding hundreds of millions of Americans’ data is so negligent that any high-school dropout can walk out the door with it?""' 'The N.S.A.’s auditing of systems holding . hundreds of millions of Americans’ data is so negligent that any . high-school dropout can walk out the door with it' - Edward Snowden, in Vanity Fair interview . Mr Snowden, 30, left his job as an NSA . contractor and fled to Hong Kong before his revelations on mass . surveillance were first published last summer. When charges were filed against him he left Hong Kong for Moscow, where he was trapped in the Russian capital's airport for more than a month before being granted temporary asylum. Yesterday's hearing in Strasbourg saw several council members criticise U.S. tactics and call for an end to indiscriminate data collection. It came on the day the European Court . of Justice struck down EU data protection rules, saying they caused . 'particularly serious interference' with the right to a personal life . and personal data. In his evidence Mr Snowden also criticised the British spy agency GCHQ, and reminded members the NSA collected countless explicit images - including from webcams. He said 'trillions' of communications were intercepted, adding: 'The vast majority had no intelligence value at all and roughly 10 per cent of images were intensely private, depicting nudity or other intimacy.' Anger: Several members of the council used the platform to condemn mass surveillance by the U.S. Authoritarian: Mr Snowden warned regimes could compile, for example, a list of 'all the Christians in Egypt' People's sexual orientation was already being collected without their knowledge, with horrific potential consequences if an authoritarian regime obtained the same technology. He gave the example of making a list of 'all the Christians in Egypt'. The court in the U.S. which approved data access was held in secret and was unaccountable to the public, he added. 'Human rights can only be protected if we ensure that our laws have a clear meaning and the meaning of the words within those laws can not be secretly interpreted by any legal body or intelligence agency without the public's consent,' he said. Dutch centre-right MP Pieter Omtzigt told Euronews: 'The United States is always saying they want to protect human rights defenders. But if they have a special program to eavesdrop on Amnesty International or the United Nations Children's Fund, there might be a potential problem.' The council invited the White House to give evidence, but it declined. A senior judge has launched an investigation into how Britain's police and spy agencies access citizens' private information. Interception of communications . commissioner Anthony May launched the investigation after finding British authorities were given permission to access phone records and e-mails more than half a million times last year. He said he had also studied Mr Snowden's claims, but found no evidence of 'indiscriminate mass intrusion'. However, he added: 'It seems to me to be a very large number. It has the feel of being too many. 'My office is in the process of undertaking an inquiry into whether there might be an institutional overuse of authorisations to acquire communications data.' A Home Office spokesman said the review was welcome but stressed: 'Communications data has played a significant role in every major security service counter-terrorist operation over the last decade, and is used in 95 percent of all serious and organised crime investigations.'","He told Council of Europe they included Amnesty and Human Rights Watch .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nigel Farage has been forced to defend Ukip’s record on using Brussels expenses, insisting he uses the public money to campaign for Britain to leave Europe. The Ukip leader said he had ‘no idea’ how much he has claimed since becoming an MEP, despite previously boasting it topped £2million. And he again sought to justify having his wife Kirsten on the payroll, insisting no-one else has ‘anything like the workload that I've got’. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage, pictured in Basingstoke, defended his party's use of expenses . Ukip has sought to exploit the resignation of Culture Secretary Maria Miller over her expenses to fuel an ‘anti-politicians’ backlash. Mrs Miller was ordered to repay £5,800 in overclaimed mortgage expenses and found to have broken the MPs’ code of conduct in her belligerent attitude towards the independent parliamentary standards commissioner. The offence was compounded when the Culture Secretary delivered a curt 32-second apology in the Commons. Last night Mr Farage insisted Mrs Miller’s constituents should have the right to trigger a by-election to remove her as an MP. But in an interview on Channel 4 News he was repeatedly challenged about his own claims. In 2009 Mr Farage boasted that he had claimed a ‘vast sum’ in allowances, claiming it ‘must be pushing £2million’. Asked how much he has claimed since then, Mr Farage replied: ‘No idea. Less than most MPs, but no idea what the total figure is. ‘The system in Brussels is entirely different, more lax than in Westminster, but we operate on a system of allowances and not expenses.’ Mr Farage drinks beer from a large glass at the Bolton Arms pub after speaking at a Ukip public meeting at Old Basing Village Hall . He insisted he had not benefitted ‘personally’ from the generous allowances on offer in Brussels, and Ukip had not broken the rules. Mr Farage told newsreader Jon Snow: ‘If you are accusing me and UKIP of taking the wherewithal provided by the European Parliament for us as MEPs, and using it politically to campaign against Britain's membership of the European Union, and you think that is wrong, that is you decision. ‘That is quite different. It is different from benefiting personally. ‘We haven’t broken the rules of the European Parliament. We have been very careful at using our lawyers and using our accountants to dot the Is and cross the Ts. ‘But be in no doubt that we use the money to fight Britain’s membership. 'There is nothing I've done with my expenses in 15 years that has been done for personal gain. I've not breached the rules for personal gain. 'I haven't bought a house and made £1 million, what I have done is to try and publicise across this country the extent to which membership of this union is damaging this country. I would like to think I haven't done a bad job of that.' Mr Farage used a speech to supporters in Basingstoke to attack the government over the Marisa Miller Expenses scandal . Mr Farage was also challenged over his decision to pay his wife Kirsten using public money. He said: ‘She’s paid a very modest sum of money, just over £25,000 a year. ‘I very much doubt that there is any other British MEP who has anything like the workload that I've got. Maria Miller quit as Culture Secretary six days after being told to repay £5,800 . ‘She did it unpaid for seven years. She . has done it, paid a modest sum, for the last seven years. That . arrangement will end in a few weeks' time.’ Last month Mr Farage denied that Annabelle Fuller, an aide also on the public payroll, was his former mistress. Ukip has been hit by a number of expenses scandals, including MEP Tom Wise who was jailed for two years after fraudulently claiming £39,000. Mr Farage conceded: ‘There are two cases of UKIP MEPs who behaved badly and acted dishonestly. ‘In both cases I got rid of them from the party before any investigation was finished by the outside authorities or any prosecutions were brought. I dealt the problem as soon as I saw it.’ He contrasted his actions with Mr Cameron’s determination to cling on to Mrs Miller for almost a week after her Commons apology. ‘I think the real issue with the Maria Miller case - apart from the fact the taxpayer helped her make a profit of £1 million - but the real issue is that David Cameron has supported her all of the way through and now he is saying he will have her back in the Cabinet as soon as he can. ‘You will find in every political party people who do things that are wrong, but the question is how you deal with it.’","Ukip leader says he has 'no idea' how much he has claimed since 2009 .

"By . Richard Spillett . A jilted husband bludgeoned his wife to death with a hammer before stabbing himself 28 times, a coroner has heard. David Connaughton, 60, killed his wife Julie after researching murder on the internet by typing 'When someone p***** you off, is it worth killing them?' into a search engine website. A coroner heard Connaughton discovered his wife was planning to divorce him before carrying out the vicious attack, in which he hit her at least 22 times. David Connaughton, 60, attacked his wife Julie, 57, with a hammer after discovering she was planning to divorce him . He then killed himself with a knife after covering her face with a bag, Chesterfield Coroners Court has heard. Police officers discovered the couple, who had been married for nine years and both had grown up children from previous relationships, on their bed at their home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, after Mrs Connaughton's daughter Emily Corless raised the alarm. Detective Constable Tony Owen said: 'We got a call from Emily Corless saying she was trying to get in touch and couldn't open the bedroom door and was concerned something had happened. 'Officers forced the door which was blocked by a large piece of furniture and found two deceased people in the room.' A post mortem report stated Mrs Connaughton, 57, had suffered at least 22 blows to her head and had cuts and fractures to her head, hands and arms. Connaughton, who had worked as a carer, had 28 stab wounds and was found with a knife between his legs. Mrs Connaughton's daughters Emily and Nicola Corless said their mother was 'kind, caring, loving and bubbly' The report found he had died hours after Mrs Connaughton and her injuries preceded his and were consistent with defence wounds. Mrs Connaughton had spoken to solicitors in July 2013 about getting a divorce and the couple had discussed the breakdown of their marriage. Det. Con. Owen added: 'We knew Julie and David were having marital problems and were almost leading separate lives. 'We were aware she had started a new relationship and, from speaking to family, David had anxiety and was concerned he was losing Julie and would be made homeless.' The hearing was told that in the weeks leading up to the attack, Mr Connaughton had researched murder online. Mr Connaughton barricaded himself and his wife in a bedroom at the couple's home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire before the attack . Police checked a computer used by him, which revealed searches for websites about divorce and homelessness - along with two search questions about killing, including: 'When someone p***** you off, is it worth killing them?' Det. Con. Owen added: 'For some reason he chose that night to go into the bedroom with the knife and the hammer and barricaded the door and attacked Julie before killing himself.' Police believe Connaughton covered his wife's head with bags from her business, Julie's Fashion House, so he did not have to see her while he was dying. Assistant coroner Paul McCandless told the hearing that Mrs Connaughton had died from head injuries and her husband from stab wounds and their bodies were found on August 16 last year. A coroner concluded Mrs Connaughton's death was as a result of an unlawful killing and her husband's death was as a result of suicide . He added: 'The injuries sustained by Mrs Connaughton are so serious and so repeated and so extreme - with clear evidence of her defending herself - it all points to someone having set about her while their intention can only have been to kill her.' He explained that Connaughton most likely caused his injuries to himself after barricading them both in the bedroom and attacking her while she was either asleep or about to sleep. Mr McCandless said: 'Due to the degree and overwhelming number of injuries there can be no issue about Mr Connaughton's intent to bring about his death as an extreme and deadly reaction to the crossroads they had reached in their relationship.' The coroner concluded Mrs Connaughton's death was as a result of an unlawful killing and her husband's death was as a result of suicide. Mrs Connaughton's heartbroken daughters Emily Corless, 29 and Nicola Corless, 34, said after the hearing: 'Mum was a kind, caring, loving and bubbly person who lived for life. 'We miss her more every day. We thought she would always be around, she didn't deserve any of this.'

"By . Hugo Duncan . Wages are growing at the fastest rate . for nearly seven years for workers taking on new jobs, according to . figures published today. Starting . salaries awarded to people securing a permanent job are rising quicker . than at any time since July 2007 - just months before the near collapse . of Northern Rock. The . report, by accountancy giant KPMG, also shows demand for staff increased . ‘at a marked pace’ last month as firms looked to hire new recruits. Starting salaries awarded to people securing a permanent job are rising quicker than at any time since July 2007 . It . suggests the squeeze on living standards is coming to an end in a . setback for Labour leader Ed Miliband who has put the ‘cost of living . crisis’ at the heart of his general election campaign. But . with the economy now recovering unemployment has fallen to 7.2 per cent . and inflation to 1.7 per cent - the same rate as the average pay rise . in the private sector meaning millions of workers are no longer seeing . their living standards fall. The Government is likely to receive . yet more good news today when the International Monetary Fund publishes . its latest outlook for the world economy. The . global watchdog is expected to raise its forecasts for growth in the UK . with Britain on course to be the strongest major economy in the . developed world this year. The report suggests the squeeze on living standards is coming to an end in a setback for Labour leader Ed Miliband . Speaking . in Brazil yesterday, Chancellor George Osborne said: ‘The British . economy is growing faster than almost any other Western economy and . creating a record number of jobs.’ The . KPMG report shows its index of average salaries awarded to new staff . hit 62.2 in March - the strongest score since before the recession . struck. The score for the number of jobs created eased from a 47-month high of 65.2 in February to a still robust 62.6 last month. Bernard Brown, partner and head of business services at KPMG, said employers are ‘raising the bar’ when it comes to offering pay to new recruits. ‘Britain may not yet be near the levels of full employment that George Osborne committed to last week but anyone looking for a new job must be increasingly confident that their search will soon be over,’ he said. There was particularly strong demand for engineers, construction workers, and experts in IT and computing last month, according to the report. Starting salaries rose fastest in the South and Midlands but the North led the way in terms of the number of permanent jobs created. Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, which compiled the report with KPMG and represents thousands of recruitment agencies and headhunters in the UK, said living standards are starting to rise after years of decline. ‘Starting salaries and hourly pay rates are up as employers battle to entice the talent they need,’ he said. ‘As real wages begin to rise across the jobs market people will start to feel better off.’ Accountancy giant KPMG said demand for staff increased ¿at a marked pace¿ last month as firms looked to hire new recruits . Andrew Hunter, co-founder of jobs website Adzuna, said: ‘More jobs are popping up all over the UK as employers gear up for a busy spring. In many parts of the country there are now more jobs advertised than jobseekers, and top talent is becoming harder to source.‘As vacancies continue to open up, and competition for jobs falls further, employers will be forced to increase advertised wages in order to attract the best talent. Now it is just a question of time until wages begin to pick-up, and jobseekers begin to feel the benefits of cash in their pockets.’ ‘As vacancies continue to open up, and competition for jobs falls further, employers will be forced to increase advertised wages in order to attract the best talent.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A mural in a Thai temple has been criticised as 'totally inappropriate' for depicting the 9/11 terrorist attacks alongside comic book characters and celebrities. The White Temple at Chiang Rai is the bizarre pet project of controversial Thai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat . As well as depicting planes flying into the Twin Towers, the mural at Chiang Rai features fictional characters such as Spiderman and Harry Potter, celebrities like Michael Jackson, as well as fighter jets and spaceships. Scroll down for video . 'Totally inappropriate': A mural in the Thai temple of Chiang Rai depicting the 9/11 terrorist attacks . The surreal painting, by Chalermchai Kositpipat, also features celebrities like Michael Jackson alongside fictional film characters, like the Terminator . Sci-fi films such as Star wars and The Matrix provide a lot of inspiration for the painting, which includes traditional Thai an Buddhist symbols such as demons and dragons . Po, the character voiced by Jack Black in Kung Fu Panda, also appears next to Jigsaw from horror series Saw . It is not just American blockbusters which adorn the walls, as Harry Potter also features riding a broom . The huge painting appears opposite a wall featuring a large Buddha and traditional Buddhist statues. Photography inside the temple is forbidden, but one tourist managed to take this picture using a camera phone. The 31-year-old insurance broker from Nottingham, who did not want to be named, said: 'The whole place is very strange. There's a pit full of hands and skulls outside that looks like something from the Walking Dead. 'Inside I was shocked to see a painting of planes flying into the Twin Towers. I just think it's totally inappropriate.' The bizarre imagery continues outside the temple itself, with a sculpture of Predator sunk into the ground . In order to enter the temple visitor pass over a bridge surrounded by a pit full of demonic hands and skulls . Kositpipat first drew up designs for the temple in 1997 and began working on it with a team of assistants . The whole structure is not due to be completed until 2070, though it already serves as a tourist attraction . Designed by Kositpipat in 1997, the surreal temple is still under construction and isn't due to finish until 2070. Kositpipat uses a team of 60 other artists to help him work on the building, and has passed designs on to them so they can continue working after he dies. Another visitor to the temple, 38-year-old business owner Alexey Statsenko, said: 'It was so different from anything I had seen before. 'When we entered I was pretty shocked to see all those images from American popular culture- Michael Jackson, Terminator, Kung-Fu panda, Harry Potter and more. 'I did not know what to think of it. It seemed some kind of a mockery. Posting on his blog, he added: 'Generally speaking it is an very out-of-the-box (for a Buddhist temple) and creative way of expressing one’s ideas.' Like Dali's cathedral in Barcelona, Kositpipat has given designs to his staff to keep working after he dies . The artist claims he is emulating traditional Thai temple art, which features scene of ancient Thai life alongside Buddhist symbolism. But he has been heavily criticised for his approach . Artwork around the temple ranges from the macabre to the magnificent to the downright bizarre . Unlike most other Thai temples which are usually brightly painted, the outside of the White Temple is plain . The outside of the temple is covered with intricate artwork and thousands of tiny mirrors to reflect sunlight . Traditional Thai art symbols, such as dragons, also feature as part of the immense artwork . 'Only death can stop my dream, but cannot stop my project,' he said in 2003, adding that he believes the work will give him 'immortal life'. He is also behind the Wat Buddhapadipa temple in Wimbledon, London, which contains another controversial mural charting the life of Buddha from birth to death. However, mixed in with symbols from traditional Thai culture are punks sporting Mohicans and leather jackets, Charlie Chaplin, and Margaret Thatcher. Spiderman, Superman, Elvis Presley and other cartoon characters all adorn this wall inside the temple . Captain Jack Sparrow, Jonny Depp's character from Pirates of the Caribbean, surfs down Predator's arm . The temple also features Buddhist statues and paintings which sit opposite the mural . The artist claims this is in keeping with conventional Thai temple art which portrayed scenes from ancient Thai life alongside figures from Buddhist mythology. However his work has attracted strong criticism. Speaking in 1998, shortly after the London murals were finished, he said: 'I got complaints from everybody – from the [Thai] government, from monks and from other artists, saying that what I was doing was not Thai art.'","Tourist criticises mural of Twin Towers as 'completely inappropriate'
